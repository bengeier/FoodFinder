{"text":"This place still rocks for happy hour which now runs from 5-11pm daily. The Kobe beef burgers are only $2 and the Roka hamachi serrano chili rolls and butterfish tataki are both amazing.  Kirin and sapporo are $5 for a small bottle, $8 for a large."}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday night, because this restaurant is just across from my resort. I am here in Phoenix for a conference. The service is good, and the decor is very nice. I sat at the bar. I got the softshell crab slider and a California roll. The softshell crab was not that fresh. The California roll had strange combination of flavors and textures. It was happy hour, so it was a pretty good deal. I've been to much better sushi restaurants, but the people are nice and the place is pretty."}
{"text":"The fish actually tasted pretty fresh (rare for Arizona it seems, unsurprisingly) but really wasn't anything incredible. I've had better poke at restaurants not specializing in sushi (grassroots and hillstone come to mind) and the rolls seemed pretty uninspired. The rock shrimp tempura wasn't anything special, sumomaya's is far superior. We had a great waiter who was very attentive, but $18 for a roll without any complexity left me a little underwhelmed. Sushi was ok for Arizona, but anyone who has lived on a coast wouldn't be impressed. I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food. Just amazing. We went because we read that the place had been on Bon Appetite's best sushi list. Well, yes, the sushi was extremely good. But the memorable dishes we tried were the crispy brussel spouts (think you don't like bp? think again), the glazed pork ribs and the grilled corn on the cob. We're still talking about the food, three days later."}
{"text":"L.A. people are so spoiled with wonderful sushi restaurants at nearly every corner - I'm one of those people. But I have to say that Roka Akor has blown most of the L.A. sushi restaurants I've been to out of the water. I don't always rate the restaurants I eat at for various reasons, but I couldn't wait to rate this restaurant. You'll see why...read on please.

Roka Akor is rated as one of the Top 10 sushi restaurants in the U.S. by Bon Appetit, so with that rating plus being from L.A., we were definitely expecting a lot. We were welcomed warmly, seated promptly at the best seat at the sushi bar, and given our menus. We took a gander, and were kind of shocked at the minimal selection of rolls on their menu. (Of course this didn't matter later once we tasted their food - everything is excellent. Don't let this disappoint you, it's excellent food.) A few minutes later, I noticed another couple seated a few seats away from us. Their waitress attended to them right away, and we still hadn't been attended to at that point, so I was immediately pissed off and ready to walk out of the restaurant. My friends who know me well, know that this action would have been true to form. I'm nice, but I'm accustomed to excellent service at all types of establishments. When I don't get it, I get pissed off - that's just who I am and I don't think I'm the only one.

I digress...

I'm glad my husband kept me seated to give the waiter a chance to come over and take our order because I ended up really enjoying myself...and the food obviously. We had a sampler of Shochu drinks, which are these delicious infused drinks. Our favorite was the Fuji Apple flavor, although all of them were good. At the same time we were served our appetizer - the Butterfish Tataki with white asparagus yuzu. (Incidentally, the Fuji Apple Shochu really brought out the flavors of the Butterfish Tataki.) Usually butterfish has a muddled flavor - I think that's just the nature of that fish, but their preparation of this fish really cleaned it up. It exploded with flavor - very delicious.

We also ordered the Hamachi Serrano Chili Maki. This roll has very clean flavors - I enjoyed it very much. Next came the Roka Sushi selection, which are 4 different types of sushi selected by the chef. My only qualm here is that one of the four nigiri given was something we also had a full order of (the Salmon Goma Nigiri). Nonetheless, all of it was good. After that came the full order of Salmon Goma nigiri we ordered, which was sooooooo SO good. My husband usually doesn't like salmon because he thinks it's too fishy, while I ordinarily love salmon. We both loved loved loved this. It was so excellent. I would definitely order it again. Finally, we received the kobe beef, which was also very good. Perfectly cooked medium rare and lots of flavor. It comes with mushrooms which added a great dynamic flavor to the meat, and this yummy creamy sauce in which to dip the meat. Delicious. For dessert, we had the Green Tea Custard. We ordered this mostly out of curiosity. Who's ever heard of a Green Tea flavored custard? It did not disappoint. Light & airy, this custard really impressed us. I only wish I had the black cod because it looked so yummy and other yelpers have raved about it, but oh well. Maybe next time.

After the meal, our server apologized for the delay we experienced earlier in the evening. I really appreciated and respected that. It was definitely a good move on his part, and he got a good tip out of it. Later, though, I thought that if they were really sorry they could have comp'd part of our meal. So here's how I came up with the score:

5 for the food, knowledgeable wait staff and nice ambiance
minus 2 for the huge f*ck up early in the evening
plus 2 for the apology
minus 1 for not comping part of our meal
= 4 (if we could rate in half points, I'd probably give them 3 1/2)

Final thought: I don't know why we didn't get approached by the wait staff as quickly as the other couple who was seated after us, but I don't believe that people should keep quiet about stuff like that. When you pay for anything at any amount, you should be given the best service possible and if not, the establishments should expect to deal with the consequences for their actions. So, keep it up Yelpers! Use your consumer power!!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality and service.  However, why is it that the more you pay the less one gets?  This has become one of THOSE restaurants.  My wife loves sushi and was so looking forward to dining here.  Unfortunately, the ridiculously high prices and extremely minimal quantity basically ruined our experience.  The tuna sushi pieces and rolls were about half or less of what we are served when dining at most other sushi restaurants.  Sensei in the Hawaiian islands is world renown but still maintains quality and quantity at reasonable prices.  If they can do it why can't Roka Akor?  Akai Hana in Goodyear serves huge portions. Really, it just is not worth it unless money is no object for you.....sorry but it's true."}
{"text":"Love this place and the ambience! Great flavors, especially the Tiger prawn.
We went here for our wedding anniversary the hostess forgot to mention it to our server, when we were leaving the manager personally came up to us and apologized! Now that's good customer service."}
{"text":"Flawless from beginning to end! We pride ourselves on being sushi snobs and we were absolutely impressed by Roka Akor. Albeit the sushi pieces were on the small scale, they were well presented and fabulous quality. Our server was charming, professional and knowledgeable; and as we sat enjoying our meal the manager came to introduce himself and thanked us for choosing their dining establishment - what a class act!  The only disappointing factor is that we live in Canada or we would definitely visit more often :)"}
{"text":"Recently visit Scottsdale Arizona in a long time friend took me to a phenomenal sushi restaurant to my delight the fish was exceptionally frseh  the restaurant was great with the exception of this young rude hostshe can't parading her self around our table trying to draw the attention of my male friend throwign her blonde hair back and forth as if she was some type of pageant model"}
{"text":"Awesome food - great happy hour.  Definitely try the pork belly, butterfish and Serrano chile roll."}
{"text":"Very special meal. We visited this restaurant with 2 of our friends. The food and service were excellent. It's hard to find a non chain restaurant in Phoenix. We all set out to enjoy our meal and that we did. 
We tried the deluxe sushi platter and it was certainly exotic, very high quality. After all the seafood I wanted to lay my foot firmly on the ground with teriyaki chicken. This is the best teriyaki chicken I have ever had in my life. Simple, delicious not too sweet not too salty. The roasted sweet potato, well, to die for. 
The service was professional, and patient."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and staff.

It's easy to spend $100 for dinner for two."}
{"text":"I just can't stop thinking about the AMAZING meal and service we received tonight. Our server was John and literally everything he suggested was so delicious and spot on we ordered multiple plates!!! We were a little difficult in our ordering but John was very courteous and patient. The butterfish tataki was so fresh!!! All of the rolls were eaten within minutes of the plates hitting table. Such a great experience. Ask for John because he was so sweet and knowledgable. We will definitely be coming back!!! The restaurant itself is gorgeous."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi, the best in AZ next to Sushi Roku. Direct competitors. Both are the top of AZ sushi scene"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Not the best place for kids, but they had a high chair and they were very accommodating.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"In this economy it is a little difficult to truly rate restaurants.  it has become true that there is more diversity in diners than I think any other time of my life between those that want a \"great deal for their hard earned money\" and those that do not care what something costs.  Although we can all understand the simple concept that \"you get what you pay for\", we are more than ever recognizing where you are paying for quality versus when you are paying for fluff.

The quality is surely exemplary here.  Unfortunately so is the fluff.  I mean the exceptional fluff...but fluff nevertheless.   The tuna is wonderful grade as well as the other fish that I experienced.  But for the price per piece I truly expected sizeable portions.  I couldnt have been more wrong.  There is a place near my home that offers \"two for one\" sushi and it is a pretty good deal.  Even though each of these pieces is slightly smaller than what you would expect you are OK because you're getting two pieces.  The pieces at Roka are THE SAME SIZE as the two for one place and the pricing is truly as high as any order of sushi is anywhere in the universe.  Drinks are skyhigh and there really just doesnt seem to be a way to get out of here without dropping $100 or more.  Even with a localdines certificate.

The atmosphere is cool/trendy but on a Friday evening at 8:30 it was dead.  I have to attribute this to the price tag in order to be here.  If price was no object I certainly would have tried (and probably really enjoyed) some of the other suggested entrees on Yelp at Roka.  The steaks are surely awesome I would guess and the tasting menu would probably be quite an experience.  I can surely see why Roka would have some five star ratings.  But for a typical Friday night to head over hoping to go home feeling truly fulfilled in a dining experience, I didnt get it.  The next time I have an expense account and wish to impress out of town clients I would love to head in here with a blank check.  But if your not ready to put a sizeable dent in your wallet, go somewhere else for really good sushi three or four times for what you'll drop here.

Lots of pretty people though and pretty decor.  Sadly that isnt realy enough these days to keep a places doors open.  I hope they survive.  I'd love to go back for a special occasion but I just can't handle the numbers on a regular basis here."}
{"text":"I first ate at Roka in London and was quite impressed. When I heard there was a Roka in Scottsdale, I was thrilled. However, I was disappointed. I ordered the same thing I had in London: wasabi shrimp and the black cod. They were fine, but not what I remembered from my first experience with Roka. 

Perhaps I misremembered my experience in London because of the ambiance of the city and I expected more than I should have. 

Everything was good. Nothing was spectacular enough to warrant the price."}
{"text":"Had the Omakase at the instruction of my waiter, since it was my first visit and I have to say that it was a brilliant choice!  I had just had the omakase at Nobu in Honolulu about two weeks prior to my visit to Roka and I still cannot believe that without a doubt I had a better meal with better sashimi at Roka in Scottsdale.  The Toro served with Himalayan rock salt was one of the best things that have ever tasted!  Highly recommend ordering the Omakase!"}
{"text":"Here's why I love thee:

1. Minimal decor...so hip, so modern, so easy to clean.

2. The bartenders are cute. They possess an inner suave without even trying. They're shy but in that \"you know Ideserve an extra tip from you\" way.

3. The custard dessert was an unusual blend of Japanese and Western flavors that you're not even sure what hit you because it's so complex.

4. The butterfish was just like butta...

5.  And the waitresses...they wore 4-inch heels without hesitation. They were fierce...the shoes, too.

Will definitely go back, and I will highly recommend to many of my friends."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everytime I go it is an exceptional experience. The service, the food, the ambiance. Last night, we went for Restaurant Week and we had a great time. Lisa, our server, was lovely and helpful. I had the bone marrow for the first time and I want to go back for more!! GO!!!"}
{"text":"Very great service from everyone working there. Therefore the only reason why I give them 3 stars is because I had a reservation booked ahead of time but didn't get seated till one hour later. They had told us that they didn't have any tables opened and had to wait for people to get up very disappointing for an high end restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last Friday to celebrate a friend's birthday. Being that our group was large (18) and the private dining room was already booked, we were seated in the patio area. (Luckily the weather was nice around 8p.m.) Roka Akor is a beautiful restaurant, from the inside out.

I ordered the Unagi ($8.50), Uni sashimi ($13.00), Yellowtail sashimi ($8.00), and two of their blood orange margaritas ($10 each). When they brought out my order, all I could think was \"wow!\" (See pics)

The Unagi (freshwater eel), Uni (sea urchin) and Yellowtail looked and tasted fresh - the Uni melted in my mouth (yum). 

The blood orange margaritas were strong and DELICIOUS and were served in tall glasses (looks sort of like champagne flutes) - the red from the blood orange added a nice pop of color (very elegant looking). The restaurant gets top points for presentation. 

This is a great spot for a date, but I wouldn't recommend sitting in the patio area if you're looking for romantic ambiance.

Service is here top-notch, which is very important if one is going to be paying premium prices for food. Our waitress was very knowledgeable, friendly and prompt. 

I'd definitely dine here again.

Btw - there is free valet and self-parking."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Roka and had their 5 course lunch and chefs dinner premium tasting menu and all I can say is I'm a huge fan of both.  
Lunch
At $23.50 the lunch course is an incredible deal and the quality of food is the same you get for dinner.

Dinner
Amazing.  Multi-course meal, amazing service, and got a special deep fried uni stuffed shizo leaf that was a bite from heaven.

Other stand outs:
Black cod
Wagyu beef sushi (fantastic)
Fillet

I'm drooling just thinking about it.  I can't wait to go back!
Itadakemasu!"}
{"text":"It's not ideal for true sushi or sashimi, but then again, as much of a foodie as I am, I haven't encountered any place truly worthwhile in Scottsdale. 

That being said, the other dishes were delish! 
Butterfish tataki: melt in your mouth. 
Duroc pork belly: was ok.
Madagascar tiger prawn: holy moly, good!
Mushroom rice hot pot: aaah, I love rice...can't go wrong here.
Yuzu miso marinated black cod: yum!
There was a beef trio (incl wagyu): wow, I'm drooling just thinking of it...

As for drinks, meh, not impressive. Good, but not anything worth writing about. 

As for service, thumbs up! 

Thus, the overall ends up being a 3 stars. Too bad the sashimi / sushi (nigiri, rolls, etc) were not better... that being said, I will state that this place is better than other sushi restaurants I've been to in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had great hopes with this restaurant, given all the great reviews.  This was my first time there - went for the omakase - Roka has two choices - a $98 which is composed of \"the most premium ingredients\" and a $128  \"comprised of rare and hand selected ingredients.\"   I ordered the $128 menu.  

Perhaps I am more of a \"foodie\" then I thought, or it was the chef's choices, but I was pretty bored with the dishes that were sent out, as I've had most of it before.  Ponzu sauce and truffle oil were on most of the dishes. The yellowtail sashimi and oyster both had a bad aftertaste. Requested some ginger to cleanse the pallet.

Squash blossom tempura wasn't anything to write home about.  Steamed mussels are well, steamed mussels.   Also on the menu were the beef tataki, which was good, black cod, domestic wagyu beef (a little gamey),  grilled asparagus and zucchini, and a wild mushroom hot pot (somewhat interesting).

The only dish that I hadn't had before was a Japanese pepper that had been grilled - which was pretty good also included was a a toro flight which I enjoyed.

For desert, passion fruit and a berry sorbet, panecotta, and fruit ie. cantelope, grapefruit, pear, mango, some berries.  Desert was definitely a dud.

Overall, expected more - the taste of the food was okay.  For what I recieved, this place fell flat.  This is not even considering the price.  Including the price into the equation, definitely thought it was overpriced and not worth it."}
{"text":"Great Sashimi selection, great ambiance and amazing Service. Enjoyed the rolls with great fresh wasabi straight from the farm. Never seen that before and never knew what real fresh wasabi tasted like. You know it's amaZing when someone is talking about the wasabi. I definitely recommend this all my friends and family."}
{"text":"We celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here last night and everything was amazing.  We had the whole lounge area to ourselves. The food was awesome. 

We had dumplings for an appetizer.  The glazed pork ribs was the star dish. I had the Jidori Chicken with a really good chili sauce.

Dessert was on the house...they brought out a chai tea custard topped with vanilla bean whip...with a candle for the birthday boy.

Alex our server was awesome! The only reason I didn't rate them a five is because we had to ask for utensils...they brought us a fork and then we had to ask again to get knives.

We are fans!
P.s. ..they bathrooms are nice as well."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. A bit on the pricey side, so I would definitely recommend going during happy hour ( which starts at 4:30 pm) and sit at the bar. They have a number of very good small bites which are 40% off. I would recommend the black cod skewer with miso,  the Japanese fried chicken, ... My friends also loved the role with the jalapeño slices and the butterfish Tataki with asparagus. Would also highly recommend The cocktails that are on special there. I think it was called the Tokyo girl? It was awesome. Very good waitstaff, and just a fun place to hang out"}
{"text":"I love this place! A little on the pricey side, but it's so good I keep going back. I love sitting at the bar or a table on date night. This is one of my Valley favorites :)"}
{"text":"Had the tasting menu for two. The food and service were great. White chocolate brownie for dessert. Amazing."}
{"text":"I could easily eat here every day and not get bored.The robata grilled meat and veggies are generally spectacular. Yuzu miso-marinated black cod, grilled scallops with shiso and wasabi, burnt tomato salad with soy dashi, baked green tea custard with caramelized banana and vanilla - presented with artistic flair and lip smackingly brilliant. I cannot rave about it enough basically. Go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"WOW!  This place is amazing.  I went here for my birthday dinner, and couldn't have asked for a better, more memorable, beautiful and extremely tasty experience.  

Roka Akor is a beautiful place, very well decorated.  It's a wide open space, and not crowded with tables, so it did not feel full at any point, and we could have conversation easily. 

It being our first time at a japanese restaurant, of this type, our waitress walked us through the menu and their process.  She told us about the restaurant and it's style of service, and had us order 3-4 dishes per person (there were three of us) to all share.  She also gave us some suggestions. 

SO SO GOOD!   The food was spectacular!  The butterfish tataki was melt-in-your-mouth, the giant (and I mean a foot long) Japanese prawn was buttery and so yummy, my roll and sashimi extra fresh and OMG good!  The rice hot-pot with mushrooms was like mushroom risotto, but so much better, the grilled asparagus was fab and the black cod - since I think I've used up all my adjectives, I'll just say WOW again."}
{"text":"Fancy fancy! It was a little much for my taste, but it's definitely nice for a nice meal out. I prefer more laid back establishments. :-)"}
{"text":"the boyfriend and I were in Scottsdale for a short weekend trip. We decided to eat here after hearing our good friend raved about their food, esp the black cod. 

Everything on the menu sounded so great, we went for the 12-course tasting menu so we could try a great variety of items. There was a 9-course menu also, but since we probably won't be visiting Scottsdale again anytime soon, why not splurge?

Oh man, every course was divine. A few of the memorable dishes were the butterfish tataki, wagyu beef sushi with caviar, foie gras wrapped in seaweed and served with black squid ink toast, rice hot pot with various mushrooms, and of course the black cod in yuzu miso.

By the 8th or 9th course, we were already ridiculously stuffed, so we ended up taking some of the leftover back to the hotel. But even though we were so full, we were still anxiously waiting for the dessert sampler. I thought it was just going to be 2 or 3 different miniature desserts, but boy was I wrong!! We waited a while for the dessert. Just when I was about to ask our server, she brought us spoons, knives, and forks. I looked across the table and saw my boyfriend with same puzzled look - \"why would we need all these utensils for the dessert?\" And then we saw a guy carrying a boat of dessert, heading our way. It was literally a boat, filled with \"exotic\" fruits, a chocolate molten cake with green tea lava, scoops of sorbet, and fruit chawamushi with honeycomb and lady finger. I almost fell out of my chair when I saw how much dessert they brought us! Everything was so delicious, esp the lava cake and the chocolate sorbet. The \"exotic\" fruits weren't exactly exotic to us because we're from california. Anyway, it was the first time that I admit defeat to dessert.

Besides the great food, we also received excellent service. I loved the setup and the ambiance of the restaurant, the open robata grill was cool. Another cool thing was that the bartenders chiseled ice blocks themselves. They put one big ice block in each drink, supposedly cools down the drink without melting too fast to dilute it. Good shochu cocktails!!! The only complaint I had was that it was too dark. (only certain seating had good lighting) I wish I could've see my food more instead of trying to guess what each ingredient was."}
{"text":"This is our first time here but it will defiantly not be out last. As I shared, this could he the greatest food I have ever tasted. The food explodes in your mouth. Everything her is cooked for days and marinated for weeks. So much flavor it leaves you speechless!!!"}
{"text":"Price to value ratio is not worth it.
Extremely small portions and unique/exotic taste.
Takes forever to get bartender's attention."}
{"text":"Dear Roka Akor, 

Is it ok if i just call you Roka? I feel that we are on a 'first-name' basis now. It was just recently, that I met you...but you came into my world like a whirlwind...i hope you can look past the fat rolls that are inevitably going to form. 

Every meeting has been amazing, but the last time was unlike anything I've ever experienced. 

It was Valentine's Day and you had a romantic evening planned for me. Even though I've had experiences with tasting menus (wink wink), yours was by far the best. 

Butterfish Tataki with White Asparagus 
Kumomoto Oyster with Yuzu 
Sashimi Selection 
Lobster Miso Soup with Wakame 
Yuzu Marinated Black Cod w/ Robata Grilled Asparagus with Sweet Soy 
Creekstone Prime Filet and Chili Ginger Sauce w/ Robata Grilled Mushrooms with Soy Garlic Butter 
Japanese Wild Mushroom Risotto 
Double Chocolate Ganache Cake 

Everything was delicious. You even made me like mushrooms! 

I was full, content and happy. 

Then it happened - you wanted me to pay?! 79 bucks? AND I had to tip you? I thought I was special...that we had something!!! 

It's ok though. You were worth every penny. And even though you make me feel a little dirty and very guilty, I can't wait to meet with you again. 

Passionately, 

Jana"}
{"text":"We went to this place for Yelp Eats.  WOW...  simply put, the salmon was fantastic with no fishy taste at all.  Our server was great and very informative as well.  It is a little pricey if there are no deals going on, but the food is definitely delicious."}
{"text":"Not like Roka Akor needs another 5 star review, but it really is that good! 

Went there on Friday with the GF BF and sat at the chef bar. This is a great spot to watch all the amazing creations come out of the kitchen whether it be the sushi chefs or the grill! 

Our server was fantastic and very attentive and the manager was wonderful (great wine recommendations!)! Both had great suggestions and they were more than happy to accommodate our gluten free requests (FYI - they have tamari in house). We started with the edamame, butterfish (amazing!) and the scallops (heaven!) These are not large portions and we were starving, but everything was delicious! 

We then moved to sushi were the BF found a common love for special salts (pink, house made curry, black volcanic, green team and finally truffle) with the manager! From that point on, we were hooked on this place! We had the spicy scallop roll and the salmon/avocado roll. Both were amazing, especially the salmon which was sensational. 

From there, we took a pause before the final round! As we were watching the sushi chef, he created an off-the menu steak tartare nigiri style with a cracked quail egg...the manager insisted we try it and it was fantastic! Such a delight!

After some more time to digest, we decided to go with the Yuzu Marinated Black Cod....this was a first for me and OMG! I am a huge fan! Buttery, melt in your mouth amazing fish! We also ordered some rice and veggies on the side, but the chef came over and advised us to a sampler instead, especially so there was no gluten in the veggies. Out comes a buffet of yummy items off the grill...zucchini's with lemon, tempura veggies (not GF though), and my oh my the asparagus! This was all just fantastic! 

We couldn't get out without a little GF cake and finally, finally, we rolled outta there after 3 and half hours of shear delight! We will be back (probably sooner than they may want us too!) as it was spectacular!"}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday dinner, and we were instantly impressed. I had made reservations so our table was ready as soon as we walked in. The service from every single person that helped us was exceptional. Our server was especially good. She was helpful with the menu, offered her recommendations when we asked, and genuinely wanted to know how we liked each dish. 

The menu is set up to order most items as shared plates, and the entrees are ala carte so you get to (or have to, depending on your perspective) order your sides separately. We had the rock shrimp tempura (delicious), scallops (cooked perfectly, and I don't even like scallops), a few rolls of sushi (small but with the perfect proportion of fish to rice) and the black cod (buttery and charred. Perfect flavors). We also both ordered a mixed drink. I had the blood orange margarita and have to say that mine was better than his (maybe because I don't like bourbon...). The rim had salt mixed with chili and tasted like something citrusy. So good!

Overall, we were both certainly impressed and will definitely be back for our next special occasion!"}
{"text":"When you walk into Roka Akor, you know you're in a trendy upscale Japanese restaurant.  With the robata grill cranky out delicious chared meats, and the sushi line shouting greetings, you are immediately drawn into this restaurant.  The wait staff was very attentive and explained each dish with such detail and excitement.  We ordered:

Kobe beef and Kimchi dumplings: Other yelpers raved about this dish but to us it was pretty bland.  Needed more kick perhaps
Hamachi tataki: Delicious.  Light and very clean flavors
Rock Shrimp: Also very good.  Our favorite dish of the night
Dynamite Roll: It was a mushy experience in the mouth and the scallops masked the crab and avocado.  
Spicy Tuna: Average.  
Hamachi Serrano Chili roll: Also bland, especially when you read Serrano chilis!  
Hamachi sashimi: Hamachi was fresh and delicious.  But expensive for 2 small pieces.  

Overall: The place was good, but left something still to be desired.  On the pricier side for sushi and the portions are definitely small so do not come starving!"}
{"text":"We had the most amazing dinner and the staff was friendly, helpful and attentive.  They recommended their favorite dishes and did not dissapoint.  The butterfish appetizer was delicious.  Try something off the Robata grill and you definitely have to try to the grilled sweet corn with butter and soy."}
{"text":"Been here twice and I have to say the first time was better than the second. 

Our first trip, we ordered the Kaseki dinner and liked about 70% of the dishes that came out. We thought there was good variety and everything was cooked right...except for a couple of over-salted dishes. 

Second trip, we ordered omakase and boy were we disappointed! There were only about 3 dishes brought out that I can say were exceptional. The rest were subpar. Again, some dishes were too salty. I think they need to train their workers to ease up on the salt here. There was a fried sole tempura which wasn't very good because the fish was mushy. Who likes mushy fish? The only good thing about the dish was the presentation. 

We were disappointed in the omakase, because for the money, you would think that they would put in a little extra effort into the food creations. Instead, most of the dishes seemed to have been made because other people in the restaurant had ordered the same thing, so why not make 2 more for us? That's just plain lazy. 

The only positive thing I have to say about this place now is that they do have fresh fish, though the selection isn't that great. No fresh uni? No yellowtail? Disappointment. 

Staff here are great though, very well-trained service people. Even so, I think from now on I'd rather go to Yasu or Hiro."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner on a busy Saturday night so the restaurant was packed and we were offered to sit at the lounge. We ordered several dishes from the bar menu since they were small portions and we wanted to try different things. The service was good and the food was amazing, beautiful presentation and great taste. The only thing i didn't like were the chicken skewers , they were burnt from the outside so every bite tasted like charcoal. The beef dumplings and salmon tartare were my favorite. 
Great atmosphere for a date night. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Anniversary Dinner at Roka

OK, so this is truly one of the coolest places we've been.  The interior is wide open and centered around what they call their Robata Grill.  We sat at the sushi bar, front and center and watched them refill the Japanese charcoal and stoke the fire.  Their ventilation system was unbelievable because amidst all the smoking charcoal with unbelievable slabs of beef, whole lobster tails and edamame - there was no smoke in the dining room.  The aromas were amazing.

Greg's personal favorite was his 'burnt heirloom tomatoes'.  They put beautiful heirloom on the grill and then blow torched the skin.  It came with a barley miso dressing. Right behind that came the freshest spicy tuna roll ever.  They bring a shark skin palette tableside and grind fresh wasabi root for you.  YUM.  Now, not to one-up the husband, especially on our ten year wedding anniversary, but my meal was king - no questions there.  I got the best filet of beef I think I've ever eaten. Straight off the robabta grill and sliced into small cubes topped with tiny micro greens.  Then came a tray of strange little mangungi peppers that were charred on the grill and served with sea salt.  SO good.

Sometimes theme restaurants like this can go too far and it winds up feeling like Disneyland.  You know, the waitresses in geisha outfits and such? The thing about Roka Akor is it is urban chic, innovative and the food is outstanding.  It stops right at the edge of being cultural tourism and leaves you wanting to go back the next day for more.

{"text":"We love the happy hour here.  The dishes are delicious and presented in a beautiful, unique, and artful way.  One favorite is the miso black cod, cooked to perfection as are their other delicacies.  The setting here is beautiful, relaxing, cozy, and ethereal.  This is a perfect place to bring your out of town guests for a unique experience.  Service is excellent.  Thank you Rick for the shishito peppers on New Year's Day!"}
{"text":"After a bad experience at our Favorite Restaurant Roca Akor in Scottsdale, we turned to Yelp and Roka's very capable manager Charles responded within an hour, invited us back and more than made it right.  We knew they had great food and now, thanks to Charles, we know they have great management.  We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the price.  Food is okay, but the service is terrible.  They are also not open for lunch on the weekends, which I think is strange."}
{"text":"Excellent date night meal at Roka Akor. Food and drinks were fantastic and we will return. A bit pricey, but we would recommend to anyone who wants a great meal.

Drinks: We tried the honey shochu (a Japanese distilled drink that was infused in house with a variety of options). It might be my new favorite drink and I would highly recommend.

For the food we decided to get a variety of small plates.

Pork Belly: One of the best pork bellies we have ever had. Served with radish and wasabi.

Crispy Squid: Very flavorful, but a little chewy. Would not order again.

Hamachi Serrano Roll: We eat sushi often and this roll was spectacular. Highly recommend. Not as spicy as we were expecting.

Bone Marrow: Great dish. A good helping of bone and marrow served with bread and a mignonette. This was my wife's favorite of the night.

Oysters: Very fresh and clean.

Beet marinated Salmon: Packed a punch of flavor. Beet flavor was noticable with apple.

Albacore with asparagus: Clean, mild flavor. Very good."}
{"text":"I cannot wait to go back here again on a Friday night, specifically at 9:30 which is when I heard they do their fancy ice machete show. 

We (me and 5 of my friends) spent a lovely Sunday afternoon at Roka Akor.  It was the launch of the hottest new beauty magazine, Runway.
It's international but housed in Scottsdale and the Fashion Director is my friend Susan Di Staulo.  They had two fashion shows in the main dinning room featuring clothing from local boutiques. 

They brought samples to our table all afternoon and everything I tried was fabulous. The calamari was to die for! It was some of the best calamari I've ever had. I'll admit I like my calamari lightly battered with no added zing, and lots of lemon. This calamari had some subtle spices added, I couldn't quite figure out what the flavors were but it was delicious. Definitely not too much, AND they were lightly battered! 

The scallops were excellent and so was the spicy tuna roll.

The decor of the restaurant was sleek, modern and eco friendly. Their bathrooms were amazing and had two different flushing buttons. My friends and I assumed they were for #1 and #2... save water with #1...?

The colors of the restaurant were warm and inviting and the drinks were excellent! We had bellini's with saki and a mixed berry juice. So wonderful. We also had saki and white wine...

Like I started this review off, I cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Scottsdale for business (which is often), I absolutely MUST come here. This place is awesome! Food is delcious and great service.

I would definitely recommend the butterfish tataki and serrano chili roll. DELISH! Their sashimi is always fresh and served beautifully.

If you're not in the mood for sushi, then the black cod is my go-to robata grill item. As for side veggies, you cannot go wrong with the sweet corn!

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I probably eat here 2-4 times a month. The New York strip is absolutely one of the best steaks in Scottsdale. Roka Akor is one of the most consistent restaurants I've ever been to and I'd probably say it's my favorite spot in town to grab dinner and a drink. Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"I was skeptical that the desert could possibly be home to one of the country's finest sushi houses. After experiencing course after course of great contemporary sushi preparations, I can only say, \"WOW.\"

We ordered the Omakase tasting menu (\"decadent\" version) and the chef visited with us to find out our likes and dislikes so that he could prepare a menu to delight.  We were not disappointed.  Every plate was beautiful and every bite was fantastic.  The nigiri and sashimi plates melted in our mouths.  The pork belly was a must have.  The grilled shishito peppers with dancing bonito flakes was a surprisingly good interlude.  The tempura lobster -- decadent.  And of course, the Wagyu beef, served with several different salts, was amazing. Service was attentive but not hovering.  Their Hani and Kudachi Cooler cocktails are both delightful.

This was a two-hour journey to remember."}
{"text":"Not my first visit to Roka Akor, and most certainly not my last, but each and every time I am thoroughly impressed. We arrived and the restaurant was very busy. Manager was very friendly and went out of his way to circle back and alert us of two seats opening up at the bar, which helped avoid the wait. This was ideal after a long day of traveling and being out of the country for the last 10 days... In a country in which the cuisine was lacking to say the least! The bar was very busy when we first sat down, but bartender made sure to acknowledge us as he darted across the bar to grab us menus to peruse. Great awareness and very efficient service from start to finish. 

We've been dying for good seafood so the tuna belly sashimi and black cod tasted even better than normal. The black cod is always cooked so perfectly, and is without question one of the best dishes in all of the valley. Perfect wine recommendation to compliment the food. Needless to say, about an hour or so later, a happy camper I was indeed. I've come to expect a next level experience from Roka, and this visit was no different. 

Food: Too much to list. Black cod, dumplings, wagyu, sashimi some of the many highlights 

Ambiance: Gorgeous space. Warm, sexy, inviting

Service: Always a positive. Bartender, Chris, was incredible on recent visit. (And not just because of the great name ;)  ) 

Price: not cheap, but one of the few that are well worth the cost. Took a peek at the bar happy hour menu though and looked like some very attractive options. Based on this,  I may have to become a MUCH more frequent guest!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a Wednesday night for dinner, and were pleasantly surprised to find that all the positive yelp reviews were true! We ordered the wagyu beef dumplings, crispy fried squid, spicy tuna roll, lamb cutlets and ginger sesame broccolini, along with wine. We enjoyed our entire meal and had great service. One downside was how loud it was inside the restaurant even though it wasn't overly crowded. Overall, the food was worth it and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Roka Akor twice. Once for the seasonal tasting menu and once for the omakase. Both times the food was OUTSTANDING. On my second visit, I brought my father while he was visiting from New York City. He is a food snob by every definition of the word! Even he was impressed with Roka Akor and would definitely recommend it to any of his friends who came to Phoenix just as I suggest it to anyone looking for a great place for special occasions or for a special date.

Everything I have eaten, about 15 courses total, has been delicious. The miso marinated black cod is the best fish I have ever eaten!  My father and I considered ordering a second one it was so delicious! The wagyu beef was beyond belief. The service is terrific. 

My only advice is to try something different than you would normally get here. Everything is great but push your boundaries a little so you can try something AMAZING instead of something just great!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  Skip the fired chicken on the happy hour menu.  Make sure you get the tempura corn."}
{"text":"I had heard nothing but good things about Roka Akor, so I was excited to dine there last Friday. It is a Japanese restaurant located in Central Scottsdale that features \"Sushi and Robata Grill\". 'Robata' reminds me of a certain song by Styx, but I was willing to roll with it anyway. Besides, \"Bon Appetit\" recently named them one of the top 10 sushi places in the U.S., so we owed it to ourselves to check it out. 

Happy Hour

There were four of us dining and we started off in the bar area to take advantage of happy hour before sitting in the formal dining area. The look of the lounge is sleek, but pretty generic. If Ikea offered Japanese themed interior decorating, Roka Akor would probably be their main customer. Nothing bad about that, but it felt a little sterile to me. Our server was very pleasant and she was attentive without being annoying. Happy Hour drinks were well priced ($3 beers, $6 wine and martinis) with a decent choice of libations. The standout was probably the Saketini my girlfriend ordered: simple drink done well. They also offer Shochu, which is like a Japanese vodka, but nobody tried it this go-round.

The Happy Hour food menu is a nice size and reasonably priced ($2 - $7). We ordered the Crispy Fried Squid, Spicy Sashimi Salad, and 2 orders of the Butterfish. The plate sizes were enough that everyone got some of each. Everything was fresh and tasty, with the Butterfish being the favorite.

Dinner

We finished our happy hour drinks and made our way into the dining room. The first thing I noticed was the noise. It was about 7:30p and the dining room was maybe half full, but the sparsity of the decorating mixed with very tall ceilings meant all the various conversations echoed off everything. Do not expect a cozy meal with conversation you can easily hear if the place is full. Our server was nice enough, but seemed a little out of sorts as if he were new or nervous. 

The wine list was a bit disappointing with very few worthwhile bottles under $50. There is good wine to be had, but be prepared to pay for it. Wine markup was anywhere from 2x - 3.5x retail. Ordering our wine was a bit of a process as they were out of a Syrah I wanted off the main list and the alternatives suggested by the server and the little-too-annoying sommelier were not doing much for us. I finally went with a 2006 Canonball Cabernet Sauvignon - fruit forward Cab that paired well with dinner.

The menu is split into different areas: Appetizers, Sashimi & Sushi, Tempura, and Robata Grilled items (sides and entrees). As seems to be the current trend, entrees are served a la carte (no sides). As a group we decided to order several things and share them. We picked items from all over the menu, so there were a mix of small plate and large plate items. One thing to note is that the food arrives very quickly and it seems to show up in a random order. We were expecting apps and smaller plates to appear first, but it was a hodgepodge of apps and entrees. A few minutes later, more plates of food arrived before we were even done with the first round. The table was crowded to say the least. The presentation of the food is excellent and you can tell the chefs take pride in their creations.

Food Highlights:

Sashimi Chef's Selection - This was amazing. The chef chose Tuna, Scallops, and Yellowtail and it was seriously the best sashimi I have found in the Valley.
Robata Grilled Asparagus - Tasty soy glaze and grilled perfectly to crisp-tender.
Robata Grilled Lamb Cutlets - 3 very nice sized lamb loin chops. Grilled medium rare and served with a Korean chili sauce. These were a big hit at the table. 
Roka Akor Rice Hot Pot - What a nice surprise this was. A cast iron pot filled with mushroom infused sticky rice. Very savory and just amazingly good - we scraped every last bit of it out. The only issue was it took so long to arrive compared to the other food, that we thought they forget about it.

Food Lowlights:

Spicy Tuna Roll - this was surprisingly boring for a 'spicy' roll. 
Beef Tataki with Salad Greens and chili ponzu - This was a letdown. Should be renamed \"miniature beef roll-ups with zero character\". Instantly forgettable... 
Japanese Eggplant Tempura - Slightly overcooked and very bland, even with the supplied sauce. 

Final Take

Roka Akor is bound to be a Scottsdale hotspot. It has that generic hipster vibe to it that just seems to pervade many Scottsdale eateries. The food they do well is excellent and easily eclipses the lackluster items. Stick with their signature dishes (Robata Grilled items and the Sashimi) and you will be pleased. I'd also recommend asking your server to space out the food orders a bit to allow you to enjoy each course a bit more. 

I will be back again, but I may just hang in the lounge area next time. It's a little quieter and the seating is bit more intimate. Plus, I still need to see what the Shochu is all about..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and this place continues to exceed all expectations! The Butterfish Tataki appetizer is amazing and the scallops appetizer was the best scallops I've ever had! The robata grill items are also fantastic. All the vegetables are great, but the lamb is beyond incredible. There's nothing like it. The sushi is fantastic, and the sushi chef was kind enough to accommodate my husband's request for a chirashi bowl (bowl of sushi rice with assorted sashimi), which was not on the menu. Their Blood-Orange Margarita is fantastic as well. The service is extremely good - very attentive, thoughtful, and knowledgeable. This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley and I'll definitely be coming back as often as I can!"}
{"text":"So i was visiting some friends in town last week & a few of us wanted to take our friend out for sushi for his birthday, little did i know we'd end up enjoying a lot more than just sushi. 

First off, the decor there is stunning. i don't know how to describe it, but there are pics on the internet you can look up if you wanted to.

We sat at the robata, right in front of the chefs & got to watch them grill meat, fish, veggies & watch the sushi chef preparing fish & sushi platters. 
Our waitress suggested the Omakase tasting menu, which we tried & were not in the least disappointed. Basically the Chef (Ce Bian) came to our table & asked us about our likes/dislikes & from then on he took care of everything. He also came over a few other times during our meal to check on us & how we liked everything.

Let's put it this way. They gave us so much food & so many courses, i don't even remember everything i ate, but i do remember enjoying pretty much all of it...

*edit* -yes, i looked up some of the  items we had on their website menu, b/c i didn't want to describe (or spell) them improperly.


Some Highlights:


The Ika; 
(spicy fried squid), amazing to say the least. i'm not usually a fan of calamari, but this put all others to shame with some lime zest on top & a squeeze of lime to finish it off. Like i said, Amazing.

The Sushi Platter; 
maybe they have a different name for this, but basically it was a big bowl with crushed ice & like 3 or 4 different types of sushi & sashimi each type had a piece for each of us so we didn't have to fight over anything. One of the items on there was Sea Urchin... well, i wasn't adventurous enough for that one, but my friends' seemed to like it. 

The Maki Rolls;
we had a few different types on our plate as with the sushi, all of it was great but i'd say the standouts were the Hamachi Serrano roll and the Soft Shell Crab roll. Awesome. Their condiments even seem better than other sushi places i've been (e.g. the wasabi & pickled ginger.)

The Grilled Shishito Peppers;
grilled peppers with salty bonito flakes were fantastic, i hadn't really expected to like this, but they were really good.

The Tenakatsu (sp?); 
This is a grilled pork belly, i thought this sounded gross until my friend mentioned \"you know what else is made from pork belly? BACON\". I laughed & then fell in love at first bite. Maybe my favorite part of the meal.

The Glazed Pork Ribs;  
These were garnished with \"reaaaaaaly finely sliced like fluffy if that's possible\" spring onions & cashews. This is just one more reason to love pork.

The Rice Hot Pot;
Kind of like Japanese mushroom risotto they bring out the pot it's cooked in & portion it out for you at your table, so good.

The Dessert Platter;
What can i say? after all the delicious & artistically presented food we'd just ate i thought, \"what are they going to do now?\"
Well, it turns out they know desserts too, in one word? Outstanding.

They brought us a giant platter. First of all i have to mention that somehow our waitress picked up on the fact that it was our friends' birthday & the pastry chef made a white chocolate \"plaque\" that was stood up in the middle of the platter & in beautiful cursive writing said \"Happy Birthday Mike\" in dark chocolate. Spectacular.

As for the rest of the platter there were four different desserts & four different ice creams / sorbets, garnished with fresh fruits & berries. we all looked at each other like  \"how are we going to finish this?\" and then we dug in.
It was obvious that everything is made fresh  in-house, including the ice creams. Fresh Mint actually tasted like mint (not mint flavoring). Chocolate-Chile ice cream, Basil Sorbet, Coconut Sorbet... fantastic all of it.
As for the desserts (which mostly had their own different ice creams on them) 
* mango & vanilla cake with a roasted rice ice cream & fresh mangos
* warm chocolate cake with peanut butter ice cream & toffee sauce & candied peanuts
* green tea custard with banana foam
* crepes with sauteed asian pears & brandy, with ginger ice cream (apparently that night's dessert special).


All in all, well worth the price. Try this place & you should not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely a wonderful experience at this restaurant.  

My husband and I always on travelling for gourmet restaurants.  It is unusual to find this gem out of nowhere in Scottsdale Road desert neighborhood.  We have read a few reviews before we went there so we knew it was an upscale, modern, award-winning Japanese restaurant.  Sure enough, the décor were openly spacious, high ceiling, open kitchen, hardwood floor with hip background music.  We were greeted by our friendly waiter promptly.  He knowledgeably recommended their popular dishes.  Among all his recommendations, we ordered butterfish tataki, dynamite scallop roll, marinated black cod and sake sashimi.  They all came nicely presented, and the taste were unbelievable delicious!  We have been to several Michelin star restaurants in London, France and Monte Carlo, we know what quality food worth.  It is unfair for some people to say this restaurant is expensive.  You cannot go to Ritz-Carlton Dining Room and complain how much they charge.  It is definitely not the tradition Japanese restaurant with the waitresses wearing kimono running around.  Actually, the two pieces of mouth-melting sake (salmon) sashimi, presented on top of a bowl of shaved-ice, mint and lemon on the side, with the waiter hand-shaved fresh wasabi in front of you, were just $6.50.

The service was truly top-notched.  Waiters and waitress were all young and energetic.  You could tell they all like what they were doing.  As soon as my husband left to the restroom, one waiter immediately folded his napkin and put it back on the table.  Another waiter saw a drop of soy sauce on mine, he quickly exchange a new napkin.  We were asked numerous times but appropriately how everything was.  There were at least 3-4 waiters, including the busboy, who have politely greeted and smiled to us, but our waiter really pampered us and made sure we were comfortable and have what we needed.  As we left, I tried to take a picture outside the restaurant, he saw us and he ran out the door and took a picture for us.  Which showed that he really cares about his customers even on your way out.  If you are lucky enough to have him, it will truly make your experience in Akor Roka memorable.  Wesley - he is!!

We are going to try their new location in Chicago this summer!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Have you ever walked out of a restaurant and your head was  buzzing?

That's how my girlfriend and I felt after leaving Roka Akor tonight.  Just magnificent. 

From the moment we stepped foot in the restaurant, the manager and the hostess were gracious and accommodating.  There wasn't a table immediately available so the manager led us to the beautiful bar where the chairs were all setup diagonally inviting us to take a seat.  A very fine, delicate, touch, something very subtle, but wonderful, which was indicative of things to come.

We were seated at the bar area facing the expansive kitchen.  It is just an incredibly inviting setup, probably my favorite I have ever seen at a restaurant.  We were greeted by our server, Victoria, who was funny but genuine, seemed to always be there just when we were about to ask about something, and never seemed pushy.  In addition to that, we brought along a coupon from our hotel concierge, after handing it to the manager, I realized it had already expired.  Upon us pointing it out, the manager said that it was no problem that he honored it.  The coupon was for 2 free appetizers, we ordered 3 and upon receiving the bill, the two most pricey appetizers were given to us free!  That was truly a nice little treat.  A quote from my girlfriend on the service, \"This is a place where I felt honored to be eating here, but the service made me feel like they were honored that we were dining there.  Humbling.\" 

But onto the food, which if you are not inclined to read this detailed review, was, according to my girlfriend, \"Probably the best if not top 3 meals I've ever had in my life.\"  Me too.

For appetizers we had the grilled shishito peppers, which I have had before, \"Will now replace edamame for me at any place that offers it.\"  The salty, grilled, spicy combination is just perfect.  The cold soba noodles and the fried oysters were wonderful as well.  The soba being presented in an exquisite manner and the oysters fried so that the oysters still maintained their oyster-y goodness but had that crispy tempura crust.

In between appetizers and the main course we had an assortment of robato grilled veggies:  Sweet Potato, Tofu, Mushrooms, Zucchini, BBQ Rice, Corn.  All grilled to the point where it tasted like I was eating a more perfect version of that vegetable.  The sauces, paired in a way that just enhanced the flavor even more.

Even after all that, the main courses stood out most of all.  We had the two signature Roka Akor entrees:  The Korean-spiced Lamb & the Blackened Cod.  

For the lamb, my girl quoted, \"I don't eat much meat, but this is the BEST meat I have ever had.  Ever.  Not best lamb, best meat.\"  I wholeheartedly agree.  The lamb was of the highest quality and grilled in a way where we could easily slice through the juicy side with a butter knife.  I was embarrassed but wanted to clean off each lollipop bone with my teeth it was so delicious.

For the cod, it was grilled lightly wrapped with a \"japanese Mulberry? leaf\", blackened but still juicy.  When eaten with the sweet mustard and the pink-pickled-onion slices, was a heavenly combination.  Individually delicious, but rarely do I feel that foods combined so well in my mouth as did the cod with the pickled onion and mustard.  Perfect.

All-in-all, not just a delicious meal, but a transcendent one.  We asked each other afterward, \"What more could you have asked for in a restaurant?\"  And we could not think of one.  Sure, it was pricey, but for the quality of service, the taste of the food, the exquisite setting, it was worth every penny and more.

The buzzing in my head hasn't stopped.  I loved it!"}
{"text":"WOW. My experience at this restaurant was the best!! The service team there is amazing and they are so attentive. The food was wonderful and I can't say enough about the service. It was so refreshing to have a great experience. It's rare these days! Thank you!"}
{"text":"First, I want to apologize for not coming here first. We went to Shinbay and we were denied service as the entire restaurant was empty. We were told every seta and table was reserved. When my guests and I arrived at Roka Akor, your hostess made sure she got us seated promptly. We sat in front of the chefs and enjoyed the scenery of cooking right before our eyes. 

The atmosphere, the service, and most importantly, the food, was all outstanding. The friends I was with enjoyed everything and raved even after we had left. Keep doing what you're doing, we will definitely be back. :)

Thanks."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited tis place on Sunday evening. It was, without question, the best dining experience we have ever had (and we travel a great deal). The flavors, aromas and presentations were wonderful! We can't wait to go back the next time we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I loved my time at Roka Akor.  The service was great, the food was just about perfect and the dining room is beautiful.  I've got nothing but good things to say.  If you are in Scottsdale and love Japanese food, you shouldn't miss this.  DONT go to places like Ra or Stingray.  You'll be disappointed (unless you're 20).  This might be a little bit more expensive, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Update to the Thursday Happy Hour - Oysters Night!

Unlimited oysters on Thursday night just a dollar each? YES, please! To the fans that enjoy raw oysters as much as I do, this is to die for! I have been back on Thursdays just for the oysters many nights, and cannot get enough! You can taste the freshness, and can't find another place simply to just beat the price!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for sushi, wanted to try somewhere new, many reviews pointed us to Roka Akor, so we gave it a shot. Fantastic service! Extremely limited sushi menu without a true sushi bar, and tiny portions of sashimi. However, the quality was excellant. Yet, we left quite unsatisfied and a bit hungry. Nothing Sweet Republic couldn't cure! ;) This establishment is for trendy folk who value presentation."}
{"text":"We were visiting Scottsdale and just happen to choose Roka Akor to dine at, and I have to say, we were so glad we did.  We had the premiere Omakase (the most expensive choice for the tasting menu), and everything we had was fabulous.  I had the sake pairing to go with, and it was spot on.  The chef came out to double check for alergies, and our waiter was phenomenal.  The desert tasting course had about 4 different desserts on it, my favorite was the mango shiffon cake with brown rice ice cream.  Yes, brown rice ice cream.  It was the best thing ever!  Would move to Arizona just for this restaurant.  It was pricey, but money well spent."}
{"text":"I will start with the disclaimer that this review is taking into consideration we are eating sushi in Arizona. With that in mind I would give four starts because the sushi did taste quite fresh but it does not compare to homemade sushi from a Japanese aunt. 

They have a pretty extensive list of sashimi available and also a bunch of rolls. I did the 3 type chef selection which comes with six pieces of sashimi randomly selected by the chef. I also had a side of sweet potatoes which were grilled with teriyaki sauce and two oysters. They have a good sake and shochu list as well. 

What you are really paying for here is the presentation and ambiance. The food in my opinion is way over priced but still of good quality."}
{"text":"Pure deliciousness. Great lamb and steak! Great ambience and you get to see the cooks at work."}
{"text":"Dare I say the best happy hour in Scottsdale? I've been several times and it never disappoints- the quality of the ingredients and the attention to detail the chefs put into the dishes is very apparent. 

As an added bonus, they have happy hour everyday all day during the summer and on Thursdays they have $1.50 oysters. They are served with the most incredible horseradish that we may have put on a variety of our other dishes as well....

Their house wines are only $5 during happy hour and taste great- the white paired perfectly with the oysters.

Although the oysters were small, they were flavorful and the presentation was beautiful. Even when we placed a second order for only 4 more oysters (because we couldn't stop after one round), the presentation was the same as if we had ordered another dozen.

The shishito peppers were good and in the past the brussel sprouts have been incredible but we did not order them this most recent time. (on a side note the size of the portions has seemed to get larger over the years- which I'm not complaining about.)

The hamachi serrano chili roll is always a go to for us.

This time we tried the softshell crab sandwich which was delicious (especially when paired with the aforementioned horseradish).

The burger has been great in the past and for $3 it's a delicious and cheap way to fill up.

The scallop ceviche taco was also delicious.

It's hard to go wrong with anything but it'll add up if you're not careful. You can stick to the happy hour menu and get more than a full meal of food and drinks but it'll cost you about the same as many other sit-down restaurants (but with this food being much tastier). The service is a bit slow when sitting in the bar/lounge area but that's to be expected because it's always packed with people who know it's worth it."}
{"text":"They were amazing! I love them so much! The staff is also super nice! I especially loved my waiter, Chris. I ran out of batteries on my phone and couldn't use my Groupon, but he let me use his phone to log in and use it. He was also friendly and really fun to talk to. I love the food, it was absolutely delicious. The Omakase is perfect! My daughter and I both loved our experience there :D I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"The good: the decor and the setting is one of the best I have seen. 
The so so: I had edamame, shrimp tempura and scallops skewers. I hate to say it but they were below average. But I gave the high grade because I think I ordered the wrong dishes. I should have ordered the cod or the sushi because they looked amazing. So i am giving it a chance.
The not so good and I dont want to say bad: the waiter! And I didn't say service because the rest of the staff we're great. I mean you expect him to know your order very well especially the restaurant wasn't busy at that time."}
{"text":"We went here yesterday for their special brunch.  It was fantastic.  We were offered all you can drink bellinis and blood orange mimosas.  There was a sushi bar with fresh sushi, butterfish with asparagus, tofu with tomatoes, and so much more.  They also brought to each table mushroom rice pots, sesame sweet potatoes, and we were allowed to order as much as we wanted on the a la carte menu.  We ordered a couple orders of the sirloin, and an order of the tofu with chili sauce.  Everything was excellent, including the service.  I look forward to their next event."}
{"text":"Spectacular! My husband took my here for my birthday. The decor was elegant, beautiful, and clean. The wait staff was professional, and made us feel welcomed. We sat at the grill, and ordered the chefs choice sashimi. The chef was so talented, and we enjoyed watching him craft like an artist. The food was fresh, clean, well balanced, and divine. and their saki selection was spot on. You want the best, expect to pay for it. This place is not for those, who are looking to save a few bucks. This is now my favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"My girl Vanessa & I were in the mood for sushi Saturday night & we decided that Roka Akor was going to be our destination! 

I loved the modern look of everything about this place, from the dim lighting to the stylish furnishings. I can't believe we never checked out the bathrooms though, 2 girls sipping drinks & no restroom trip? Boo us! 

We opted to sit at the bar & took 2 seats facing the restaurant. I started off with a Kirin light ($5 for a 12 oz bottle) & V got a glass of white wine. Off of the Izakaya (aka happy hour) menu we ordered: the Kobe beef & Kimchi dumplings (3 pieces for $5), their signature Hamachi Serrano Chili roll (6 pieces for $5), their signature Butterfish Tataki (3 pieces for $5) & the Cremini mushroom with soy garlic butter skewer (3 pieces for $2). Loved them all except the roll, I guess we are wimps because we thought it was too hot. I hate doing so but V sent it back, they were cool about it & didn't charge us for it. Disappointed with our sushi (the main reason for going out!), we decided to try a couple other rolls off of the regular menu. We ordered the Spicy tuna & their signature Soft Shell crab rolls. The tuna was delicious but we've both had better else where. I thought the soft shell was ok but V hated it, the warm crab just rubbed her the wrong way I guess. She wanted to return that roll as well but I stopped her, I felt bad! Still feeling hungry, (we must sound like major fatties w/all the food we ordered but I swear, small portions!) we couldn't resist & ordered the Prime beef filet w/chili ginger sauce (medium rare). OH EM GEE!!! This was definitely the favorite of the night, it was so tender it melted in our mouths! The sauce was tasty as well. Oh & we also shared their signature Blood orange margarita, one of the best cocktails I've had in a while! 

With all that food & drink our total came to about $100 (including tip), not bad at all for the location & quality of food. So our dinner didn't go exactly as planned but we had a great time & would definitely come back again, just not for the sushi!"}
{"text":"I went to Roka Akor over the weekend and WOW!!  The service was phenomenal and the food was even better!!  

My date and I shared the shrimp tempura appetizer (which comes with a really tasty chili mayonnaise dipping sauce!), two sushi rolls and their shashimi tasting menu.  It was my first time ever ordering shashimi and I was a bit nervous, but our server convinced me that this was the place to try it...and man was he right!  Sooo good!  We also ordered a round of sake (be careful....it's really potent!), which our server poured for us every time.  We stuck with the basic blend, but will definitely try one of their unique sake flavors on our next visit!

Oh ya, and be careful in the bathroom!  There is a full length mirror at the end of the walkway to the stalls that can be very tricky after a round or two!  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So, to get it out of the way, the Butterfish Tataki is overrated. It was our least favorite thing. $9 (on happy hour, normally $11) for 5 teeny tiny pieces of sashimi with white asparagus inside. It tastes about as good as it sounds.
For the good stuff, and I mean, really good:
I had the organic chicken breast and there wasn't a speck left on my plate. My husband had the cod which was also good but the sauce had a weird texture and color so it detracted from the taste of the fish, which was beautifully done. However, after waiting about 30 minutes for the fish, the owner (I'm guessing) came by and said the chef was unhappy with the way the first cod turned out and he was re-firing it and it would be a few more minutes. No problem, but maybe offer us a sushi roll or dessert as a show of good faith. Otherwise, just don't come by at all - it makes your staff seem incompetent and you seem cheap.
Sides are sold separately, ranging from $5-11. For $5, we got 4 spears of asparagus that was just alright. As I'm writing this review I changed from 4 stars to 3 because the more I think about it, the more it was just \"A-OK.\" We also had the edamame and California roll - not mind-blowing.
One more thing... the waitress was not personable, at all, and neither was the bartender. I'm confused by all the reviews that rave about the service. I must have said \"thank you\" to the waitress 10 times (for bringing our food, filling our waters, taking our plates, bringing our check, etc.) and not one time did she say anything back, or even smile/make eye contact. She just briskly walked away from the table. It was like being on a bad blind date, really awkward.
I had purchased a Groupon to use here, and our total was $80 (after the discount was applied). I can't say that the entire experience was worth $120."}
{"text":"This place is, quite simply, amazing.  To start, the atmosphere is excellent, especially in front of the Robata grill, and is very upscale without being pretentious or snotty.  The drink selection is great, and unique: I had several of their \"shochu infusions,\" and I would recommend them, especially the honey and the apple.  We shared several entrees over the course of the evening, including the blackened tomato salad, marinated pork chop, yuzu miso black cod, baked green tea custard, and the Raspberries and Lychee.  All were delicious, and I was surprised by how much I loved the cod.  In general, I tend to steer clear of fish entrees (not really a fan), but the black cod was possibly the best thing I've ever eaten.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"First of all as soon as we came in the hostess was extremely off and rude. Idk if it's because my family and I were dressed in shorts and tanks and this is a \"super fancy Japanese  restaurant\" so she sat us down and rudely says enjoy your meal. My sisters and I are servers so we were kind of weirded out by this. Okay so our server came he was nice and knew the menu but failed to tell us that one oyster (which is $4.50 for one) is literally the size of a quarter. So I told them I'm not paying for it, it shouldn't be a big deal though because you can easily just throw the oyster back in the freezer. They're not flavored there whatsoever. But then we also ordered something at the beginning and canceled it. However, they still brought it out. And you can tell the server was getting aggravated when we reminded him that WE CANCELLED IT. He also took forever to bring me a side of rice so I had to ask another server to bring it. It's funny because they're extremely overstaffed however, hardly busy at all and never really checked on us to see if everything was okay. Also when we left. He held the door for us and said bye but went to the hostess and talked shit right in front of us. The menu is stupid and has no descriptions whatsoever. It is way too overpriced for something that is smaller than the Palm of your hand. The food was okay. Sushi garden is better which is hilarious because this places was 4 times as expensive with half the proportions"}
{"text":"Just had dinner and although it was pretty good the price was a little high. We did have apps, sushi, drinks and a free dessert and the price was $65 per person. I would go again but sit at the bar for happy hour, which is still pricey."}
{"text":"Delicious food awaits here! I had the Misoyaki (?) Wagyu which was nothing short of buttery incredible-ness of epic proportions, Tempura appetizers and some baby yellowfin sushi wrapped all this up in a great setting."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Roka Akor for Valentine's Day.  I love sushi, however she does not and we thought this would be a good balance of choice. 

Overall, the vibe, décor, and experience are great.  We liked the general vibe.

We chose to partake in the prix fixe menu for V-day and the first couple of dishes were very good, not mind-blowing, but very good.  As the meal went on nothing about any of the dishes stood out to us, which is not a good thing at this price point.  You won't find more expensive sushi/Japanese in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area!  

Service was merely decent, but I can live with that on such a busy night.

However, the part that delivers the 2 star rating came shortly after we left and intended on continuing our night out on the town...  we both got, uh, uncomfortably ill at roughly the same time and spent the rest of our night alternating between the bathroom and the bed.  NOT the recipe for a romantic Valentine's Day!  

I know these things happen, but violently ill on V-Day tells me we likely won't be back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Loved the restaurant. For all the Japanese restaurants I've tried this is one of the best. The pork belly appetizer is a must try...it just melts in your mouth. We even had seconds because it was so good. The spanish mackerel sashimi (2-course) was good but I think our waiter exaggerated the second course a little. The fish bones were supposed to be deep fried and so crunchy that you can just eat them but the truth is not so. It just basically a thin layer of left over fish meat on the bones that is edible not the bones itself...so I could do without the second course.

We also ordered the fresh oysters which were a little overpriced - $4.50 each and they weren't very big but definitely tasty and fresh.

Next we had the salmon avocado roll and the hamachi with serrano chili roll. They were both very good. Finally we ended with the rice hot pot with mushrooms. My 9 year old hates mushrooms and was a hesitant about the dish but in the end he enjoyed it tremendously.

Overall service was excellent. Our server Alex was wonderful. The ambiance was comfortable and food was very good. Portion size is appropriate, this is after all a Japanese restaurant so don't except American-sized portions. It's more like a tasting menu so order a few different things to try.

Side Note: I took one star off for inconsistency. Our second order of pork belly took a long time and wasn't as good as the first one (though they did comp us). For a restaurant of that caliber everything about their dishes must be consistently good and well prepared."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Sushi, steak and fish were delicious.  Private room was nice but felt a little closed off to the great vibe in main restaurant.  This is a must stop IF you are in the area."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are top notch. We really enjoyed our experience here and happily recommend it to anyone looking for the best sushi around. They care about their customers and it shows."}
{"text":"We came here on the recommendation of a friend of mine.   Our experience was definitely mixed.  I had an amazing glass of sake;  the O toro sushi nigiri was melt-in-your-mouth heaven; and the Niman Ranch beef dumplings were awesome.  But all the vegetable dishes had way too much salt, the much-acclaimed butterfish tataki was \"meh,\" and the sushi was definitely of subpar quality (other than the Toro).  I was particularly disappointed that the \"chef's selection\" sushi was nothing more than your standard selection of maguro, hamachi, etc...I was expecting something far more creative given the price.  I don't expect to be back, given all the other options for sushi in the valley."}
{"text":"I was kinda waffling on Roka based on some of the negative reviews, but figured, what the hell...the food pics seemed interesting enough. 

The interior is quite a sight...open, trendy-sophisticated take on Japanese dining with a regular bar straight ahead as you walk in, an open-kitchen to the left partly surrounded by sushi bar seating, and a well-spaced dining room...meaning you're not sitting on top of neighboring diners.  

Unusual, but very professional, courteous and efficient waitstaff routine...we started off with one waiter who explained the menu to us, our primary waiter who actually took our dinner orders, and several other waiters who either delivered our apps/entress, and/or refilled our wine/drinks.  Like I said, unusual, but very efficient.  If our primary waiter was busy with another table, the slew of waitstaff promptly attended to our needs.  Nice touch. 

Our party of four ordered several appetizers including the Butterfish Tataki w/white asparagus and yuzu, Yellowtail with ponzu, Burnt Compari Tomato salad, and fried squid with chili and lime.  The Butterfish was very fresh and the contrast in texture and flavor with the white asparagus and yuzu was surprisingly good.  The fried squid was very tasty with a light coating and nice spice from seasoning, raw jalapenos and citrus.  The Yellowtail and tomato salad were just okay. 

I ordered the New York strip steak (yeah, I know...why the hell am I ordering a NY strip in a Japanese restaurant?  So, sue me, I felt like NY strip), while others in my party ordered the Yuzu Miso marinated Black Cod and the Deluxe Chef's choice sashimi platter (market price) for two.  

I always enjoy the open-kitchen atmosphere and we were sitting sufficiently close enough to see them prepare our meals.  They properly cooked the NY strip over an open fire grill, let it rest properly, and surprisingly, brought it out to me already sliced.  They basically took all the work out of eating a NY strip.  All I had to do was pick up and chew.  A nice warm, red center - medium rare, accompanied by a black truffle aoili.  I thought the aoili overpowered the NY strip, but that's just me...I just prefer it with just a little salt and pepper.  Overall, nicely cooked and presented NY strip.  Like Flemings and Ruth's Chris, Roka serves their meats a-la-carte.  I ordered a side of grilled Asparagus with sweet soy and it was a tasty, albeit a tad salty.   

I tasted the Black Cod and although it was very flavorful, I thought the Yuzu Miso overpowered the flavor of the cod.  Still, the cod was perfectly cooked...tender, yet flaky with a nice texture.  

The Chef's choice sashimi platter was impressive in both presentation and content.  It was presented on a large stone bowl with crushed ice as well as a small ice sculpture mimicking a stairway.  Nice selection of fresh fish, shellfish, including o-toro, king crab, uni, and a variety of other fish that I couldn't recall.  From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.  With this platter, they also served freshly grated wasabi and freshly ground salt.  They encouraged a small dab of fresh wasabi and salt on the sashimi rather than the ubiquitous soy...which tends to drown out the flavor of the fish.    

Quite an eclectic crowd as well...some folks were dressed very casually in jeans while others were dressed much more formally, and one party even that looked like they were dressed for the prom...wait, maybe they were going to the prom???  

A solid choice if you're looking for high-end Japanese cuisine in Scottsdale...not the best Japanese I've ever had, especially coming from LA, but damn good for AZ.  The waitstaff should really be commended for their professionalism, courtesy and attentiveness.   

I give it a solid 4.5 stars.  Great Christmas Eve dining experience.  I docked a half a star since Roka is, IMHO, a tad overpriced but it is Scottsdale..."}
{"text":"Roka Akor provided the best dining experience I've had in a long time.  Our waiter (a tall, slender man with an exotic accent) gave us excellent recommendations and really built an amazing dinner for us.  We came here with friends, and started out with the butterfish tataki and \"special mushroom.\"  The butterfish was as buttery and smooth as I knew it to be but the sauce that they paired it with gave it an extra kick of flavor that makes you want to have more.  The special mushroom was enhanced by the truffle oil that they sprinkled on top, and our friends and I were fighting for the last piece.  For dinner we ordered the black cod, filet mignon, scallops, and an assortment of sushi rolls.  Everything was amazingly delicious, but the dynamite rolls were my absolute favorite.  The cocktails were really great too.  The Banzai Mule was perfect for a summer's evening. We can't wait to come back here again because we want to try everything!"}
{"text":"best happy Hour! I love \"the wait list\" cocktail...so good. And i definitely recommend the crispy butter fish roll with wasabi aioli, Japanese fried chicken & the udon noodles. Great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"When I finally made it out to try this place I was not disappointed. The restaurant had a great vibe and atmosphere and the servers were very friendly and knowledgeable. They specialize in cooking the freshest produce, fish, and meat on a robata grill. I had blackened cod, and it was absolutely incredible. Their sushi is fantastic and so are their mixed drinks. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"A group of us from out the state decided to try out this place.  It was recommended by a foodie friend.
Anyway we all loved our food especially the Black Cod and the Rib Eye.
Also, the service was wonderful - my husband made a mistake in ordering his Rib Eye - with no hesitation they remade it for us - with no extra charge - very gracious service.
Our server was Paul - he really knew and described the menu well.
The maitre D was very helpful when my husband miss ordered.
A beautiful place too"}
{"text":"Food was a five, service was a two. Timing was way off and my wife's food came out way before mine. At the end, we ordered the white chocolate brownie and two cappuccinos. Drinks came out in about five minutes and dessert about 20 minutes after the drinks. We really didn't want it at that point but it was delicious like everything else. Kudos to the manager who came over, apologized and comped the dessert. We'll certainly go back based on the food but hope our service lapse was just an exception."}
{"text":"Ok it was great when it first  opened. Fast forward a few years and I've seen and experienced enough ridiculous encounters to give the updated review of this dying Dino. New manager and chef every few months. That should tell you something.  My last visit lasted 2.5 min. We asked for an additional seat at the high top tables and the \"manager\" of the Month informs me chairs can't be moved from the bar area because it takes away from the bartender. So out of the 8 empty chairs at the bar, you cannot spare one to move 2.5 ft away so we can all sit at a table instead of scattered all over the bar.  Ok your wish is my command. We won't be wasting a penny at a restaurant charging big $ but run by managers who have had frontal lobotomies. Yes we must pay $30 for a order of pseudo fresh tuna but will not move a chair for the customer.  Managers here have no brain and must follow rules that make no sense. Well we left and I hope the bartender makes a lot of $ wiping glasses and chatting with his empty bar chairs. I'll spend my $200 somewhere else. Earth to Roka, there is a reason why you need to have all night happy hours and the main dining room is empty. And incompetent managers like this don't help."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Roka Akor. While on vacation in Scottsdale, we happened upon this spot basically on sight. Ambiance is very stylish and cool. We sat at the robata bar near the open grill. The aromas were wonderful, but the smoke can get overwhelming after a while. Service was friendly and helpful; he recommended I have the skirt steak cooked to more of a medium than my usual rare, which was a good tip. Mushroom hotpot was really good as were the veggie sides. The torched salmon nigiri was my favorite appetizer. Be prepared for a pricey dinner though."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice. Very cool atmosphere and decor. Excellent wine. Outstanding food. Attentive staff. Save room for dessert! Our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Sit at the bar so you can see the kitchen staff cook on the grill if you can, its worth the wait. All the flavors were delicious. Savor every bite."}
{"text":"Expensive but worth every penny.

If you are looking for a couple of quick rolls and some sashmi before a movie, this isn't the place for you.  Go to Sakana (which is also very good).

You go here for an EXPERIENCE.  Get the Omakasi and plan on eating for 3 hours, being stuffed but still eating because it is otherworldly delicious.  I've gotten the Omakasi 4 times now and every time I have been blown away."}
{"text":"Excellent flavor to the charcoal grilled meats, Uni was divine but pork belly less than desired moisture ratio aka fat to meat ratio not ideal, saw it come pre cooked and then it goes on the grill for the finish. Overall Groupon experience was still pricey for the quality level. May be back if we find ourselves two or three months with no NYC/LA/Tokyo trips."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Good rolls, fantastic Kobe slider and tasty veges.  Can't go wrong or beat the price."}
{"text":"\"Are you comfortable dining with chopsticks?\"
\"Will you laugh at me if I said no?\"

The final stop for Arizona restaurant week brought me to Roka Akor, a place that I've been eager to try in Chicago. I was thrilled that they had another spot open in Scottsdale and did not hesitate to book a reservation.

From the outside, the place looked very modern and warm. Inside, it was the standard setup: cocktail bar on the right side, dining area on the left and sushi bar/cooking area in the middle. I got seated at the sushi bar. What was already encouraging was the fact that hostess gave me some recommendations on the restaurant week menu without prompt. I decided to give the rest of the special menu a whirl.

To start, I ordered the prime beef and kimchi dumplings. As I've stated in some of my earlier reviews of other restaurants, I'm not a big fan of kimchi. Yet somehow this combination worked. Not to mention that the shell was cooked nice and soft. The kimchi added to the beef filling to give it a nice kick. Next came the Grilled Skuna Bay Salmon with Ginger Teriyaki and House Pickled Cucumbers. I was surprised that they asked how I wanted my fish cooked; after tasting this dish I know why. The salmon was cooked perfectly medium (I probably would have hated the dish if I requested it well done) and the cucumbers were excellent. The final dish was the one that I loved the most: Warm Toffee Cake with Peanut Butter Ice Cream. HOLY. CRAP. The chill of the ice cream coupled with the warm softness of the cake made the dish very very tasty.

What I liked most about this experience was the service and great attention to detail that I had. The time to table wasn't quick, but I was ok with it because it showed that there was a lot of care that went into the dishes.

I wouldn't hesitate to come back and dine here the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place needs 6 stars. Alinaeem and company dinner here was awesome."}
{"text":"Roka Akor was a combination of excellent service, ambiance, and most importantly, exceptional food with a wide variety of great dishes to choose from including hot and cold plates, tempura, grilled steaks, seafood, sushi, as well as a diverse selection of drinks (cocktails, sake, shochu, and beer). Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helped us pick our dishes, all of which turned out to be mouthwatering, from the butterfish tataki (with white asparagus and yuzu) to the scallops, the black cod, and the fillet mignon. The \"special\" mushroom with truffle oil was delicious, also recommended by our waiter. I also really enjoyed a few Banzai Mules (ginger vodka, pineapple, and ginger beer), a nice varation of the Moscow Mule which I am a big fan of. This place is quite pricey, especially because you want to try so many of the dishes, but well worth it. If we come back here on our next trip to Scottsdale, I will have to try the mighty Madagascar tiger prawn (with yuzu kosho chili paste) that our waiter also praised."}
{"text":"THE Japanese restaurant to go to in Scottsdale. Beautiful aesthetic, thoughtful and fresh Japanese dishes, wonderful service.

You HAVE to get:
- Butterfish Tataki
- Black cod
- Brussel sprouts 
- Any combo of: Broccolini/ Corn)
- Kobe beef filet
- Dynamite Scallop Roll"}
{"text":"Love this place. Oyster happy hour Thursdays. Rich flavorful food. Great service every time  I have been here. Expensive but worth every penny."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Roka Akor for happy hour and really enjoyed it. We tried the crispy butterfish, avocado maki, and chile serrano rolls and they were all great. We also had the burger as well as the truffle fries which were surprisingly good. There was quality service and we were well looked after. The prices were decent for the quality of food, and there was a pretty good deal for happy hour."}
{"text":"Not sure about this one! The food was ok, the server kept saying how they won best sushi over and over again, found it a little annoying. Shared some rolls with my wife, it was good but had better at Hana for half the price"}
{"text":"The standard Sushi is Very good but the best is the Chef's Special that pairs drinks with special dishes don't get sticker shock with the price on the menu it is  well worth the experience ......"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of their happy hour and wish I was in the area more often during those hours. You gotta get the \"Chibi\" burger which is a 3 oz Kobe beef burger for 3 bucks. $3/oz of Kobe beef is cheap! The homemade sesame bun is amazing too. I was always curious what the sweet taste in buns was from and asked the waitress. She asked the chef and apparently the bake them with a touch of maple syrup! Anyways-if you get 2 chibi burgers and the roast duck with kamichi udon for happy hour, you'll spend $12 and will leave very full.

Only one small complaint.... For dinner, I decided to order their signature lamb cutlets with Korean spices. For being a signature item, and being the most expensive item on the menu besides the fillet Mignon, I expected a lot more from it. Don't get me wrong, it was good and for $10 less, I would have been extremely happy but the presentation was very basic and the way they offered the spices (just a small dipping dish) kind of let me down. However, my girlfriend ordered the signature marinated black cod and it was magnificent. The waiter had recommended the Hamachi Serrano Chili roll which was very good too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Roka for dinner last night for my first experience with delicious Sushi. We ordered the vegetable tempura, sweet potatoes, and sweet corn which were all delightful. Additionally, I ordered the Skuna Bay Salmon and my boyfriend ordered the California Roll and Sashimi Chef Selection. My dish was perfectly delicious and Tim enjoyed his dinner as he always does when he visits Roka. 
This turned out to be one of my favorite dinners out in quite some time!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my brother in law and was pleasantly surprised.
Waitstaff was friendly and knowledgeable, atmosphere and decor really great. My brother in law and I ordered a wide variety of sashimi and sushi dishes which we shared. Fish was very fresh and very high quality. 
Food was excellent as was the service. Our second time here and we will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Unbelievably accommodating service.  No matter how you want to tweak the menu, they're willing to work it.  Nice selection of Sake too.  I was a little disappointed in the selection of sashimi though.  The fish was good quality but no out of the ordinary selections.  Outstanding desserts.

Definitely overpriced though.  $160 per person."}
{"text":"Ok, here is the setting: It is Friday July 4th, my new roommate (an old old friend) and I decided to go to Taliesin West to watch the fireworks.  We get there and what I think was the first full blown Monsoon of the season is in full blast. My roommate, who was never dainty till then, announced that she was not getting out of the car and running 50 yards in the rain. I said fine let's go to Roka Akor for dinner as I have been there about 5 times and the food is worth every penny, the lamb is my favorite dish and I love the Scallops! If you know me you know that is saying a ton since I don't eat much seafood.

That said:
The service was another story. 

My dinner date and I ordered the green tea lava cake (I forget the actual name) and were informed that it would take 15 to 20 minutes by our at times inattentive waitress. It felt at times like we had to shoot someone to get drink refills.  

Because of this we ordered some ice cream/ sorbet to nibble on in the meantime figuring 3 scoops of ice cream on a block of Ice in a slow restaurant would take 5 minutes. IT TOOK 15! 

When we finally got the ice cream we ate it and 10 minutes later still did not have the cake. When pressed on the time table the waitress informed us the the \"pastry chef had dropped your cake and it will take another 15 minutes\". I smell something you find in a disc in a field in the mid west. It is brown and when it dries you can throw it!

At this we promptly canceled the order and asked for our bill. While the Ice Cream was made Gratis I expect a much higher level of service from a restaurant that expects me to shell out upwards of $200 for dinner. The food warrants the price, the service did not.

Oh and a little extra... They have canceled lunch service for the summer."}
{"text":"Won't find better sushi in Scottsdale. Period. Pro tip: order the spicy sochu infused martini."}
{"text":"Holy 5-star food, Batman!  

We visited this place 2 nights in a row, it was that phenomenal.  The service here makes you feel like royalty.  It is unmatched in the attentiveness and professionalism of the staff.  

The sushi is out of some award-winning class of food; trust me, I'm a big sushi fan and have had a lot of sushi at many different places.  The attention to detail given by the sushi chef wins an award.  My husband had some well-prepared Japanese steak dish which he could not stop talking about the next day.  

Finally, dessert was fantastic!  We ordered this dessert from heaven.  When you go there, just order the dessert with pop-rocks on top of it.  You will not regret it.  

If you want a truly special, unique, polished and out of this world dining experience, visit this place.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Went to an event here and it was beyond PERFECT from the food to the service everything was amazing. Very impressed. Louigi and the management were amazing with every detail. The service was great. I'm so happy that Courtney from Serendipit put on this event. It was really perfect and will definitely be back for future events!"}
{"text":"Hamachi Serrano and the Chirashi roll are outstanding! Also, recommend the mini burgers during happy hour. In general, the happy hour is excellent here and worth every penny. 

We have dined here many times and each time has been great. However, the only issue we have had dining here is with the sashimi being cut poorly. Each piece was very tough and we couldn't even chew them. Otherwise, everything has always been very good. 

I highly recommend also taking their all you can eat sushi making class if you are looking for something fun to do!"}
{"text":"Amazing ! Great service great chefs awesome food ..blown away ! Warning !!! Warning !!! Once you eat here regular food will not taste the same ..eat at Roka if you want to eat like a king !"}
{"text":"The Chef's tasting menu ($98 version) provides one of the best culinary experiences in the Valley. The chef comes to your table, discovers your likes and dislikes, and then prepares a multi-course meal that is simply divine. The sushi is so good here it is an absolute travesty to muck up the taste with soy sauce. There is simply no other place in town that can compare. The robata grill is also fantastic. Expensive but worth every penny."}

{"text":"SIMPLY AMAZING.  I am a foodie and frequent sushi & Japanese spots across the nation - including a recent visit to Morimoto in NYC (of Iron Chef acclaim) and who would have thought the best Japanese food experience I would have would be in Scottsdale?!?!  I'm from Chicago & spend time in NYC - - how is this possible??  

Roka Akor blew all expectations out of the water.  The dining experience reminded me of my visit to the French Laundry - the standard for a high quality dining experience with unparalleled food, decor and atmosphere.  Decor was elegant, rich, architectural and well thought out.   Staff was professional, service was top notch with just the perfect amount of conversation.  Best in class GM - her name is Joy - and she knows how to cater to the customer.  We had so many people waiting on us I don't have room to list them all.  

The food.... you can't begin to imagine how amazing... 

I highly recommend the sushi platter  - presentation looks more like art than food and the palate is unreal that there can be so many different flavors and textures from fish I've eaten a hundred times.  It's almost scientific in the way they perfectly balance the pairings.   They get it - they know soy overwhelms yellow fish, they know just how to make the cut of sashimi that melts like butter in your month, they know how to balance the flavors in ways I have never experienced and which I found truly insightful and enthralling.   

I also highly recommend the ribs from the ROBATA GRILL.  It was in this moment that I knew this place was no \"sushi spot\" in this one type fits all mass market society.  You know that feeling you get when you discover a real \"game changer\" before everyone else - that's exactly the feeling I have when I think about the Roka Robata Grill.   I've never seen it done like this before and with such breadth in the menu.  It's UNREAL ....  there are no words to describe the food experience from the Robata Grill... you must simply experience it to understand why I'm talking about.  

I also mentioned the atmosphere - awesome, very cool, chic, authentic and definitely SIT AT THE COUNTER (if you can get a space).  I found myself with my neck turned all night watching their head executive chef - CHEF CE BIAN work with precision and rhythm.   It was clear that the place was also the place to \"see and be seen\" but not in a cheesy way - a much more upscaled toned down confident way and definately inviting to all groups.  

Honestly, the place is undervalued.  In Chicago or NYC, they could easily double the prices.  Someone mentioned  they are opening up a new location in Chicago and I just confirmed it on their website.  All I can say is watch out Japonais, Sunda, Nomi....  this place has you beat on all levels and Chef Ce Bian will be turning heads in a big way.  I simply can't wait to experience it again and all without a 3 hour plane ride!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST dining experiences I have ever had! I met friends for diner at Roka Akor on Friday night and it exceeded all expectations. The food was incredible, the service was exceptional, and the entertainment was priceless! There was an (unintended) fire in the open kitchen which set off certain sprinklers, created black smoke, and triggered the fire alarm. It was a Vegas-worthy pyrotechnic display that caught everyone by surprise. Our hospitable server, Eugene, handled it with class and professionalism...and the right amount of humor. I am already looking forward to visiting Roka again soon. 

P.S. The Black Cod changed my world for the better :)"}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant that caters to out of town visitors. I made a reservation on open table from the restaurant 's website for a table for 2 at 630 pm on Friday night. When my friend and I got there, we were told that we need to sit in front of the kitchen on countertop or sit at the bar waiting for a table. The host told us that making reservation on open table does NOT guaranteed us a table. He said that he would try to get us a table eventually but could not give us a time. I think this is just HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! It defeats the whole purpose of making the reservation on the restaurant's website."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have ever had.  All of the food is terrific and resonably priced.  The waiters are willing to help you pick our sushi, drinks, and appetizers that complement each other.  The fresh wasabi here is excellent.  They have a huge wine list too."}
{"text":"Excellent! The sushi was fresh and delicious. However, I highly recommend the Prime Beef Tataki and Waygu Beef Kim Chi Dumplings."}
{"text":"We are very experienced sushi eaters, spanning three decades, so it is a little tough to impress us. We enjoyed our choices, but wasn't overwhelmed like some of the other reviewers. The restaurant is beautiful and we were impressed by the kitchen (as we sat at the bar). Our server was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. We thought the prices were high for what we received, and a little disappointed that they didn't offer sake under $28 a bottle (approximately 6 small cups). Our server did make a mention that the sake cups were from Japan, but it still didn't justify the cost of the bottle. They were very accommodating with my food allergy, and the food was served expediently. I think that is because they want to move the guests in and out quickly. For a very large space, they don't have a lot of tables, so I would strongly recommend reservations, or plan on eating at the bar. Overall, it was nice, but not sure if I would rush back when visiting Scottsdale again.

I'm giving it 3 stars because I can see how it would be a popular place, due to the ambiance, service and selections. I just don't think it is \"as good as it gets.\""}
{"text":"I was recommended here by a client of mine and I got to tell you, I was very impressed. The service there was quick and the food was amazing. We tried the scallops, dumplings, sushi, cod, and steak and by far they were all the best I've ever had. Highly recommended and definitely will come again."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! 
Never been to Scottsdale! First night here, friend took me to this place! Soon as I sat down and started eating, I said to her, 'how are you going to top this the rest of my days here?!' 
Pork belly dish was phenomenal!!! and no joke, the brussels sprouts!! Omg! I hate eating Brussels sprouts in general and I am so coming back for that @ Roka! 
I would just fly back here from Cali just for this place!!"}
{"text":"The only reason why I am giving this restaurant three stars was because the food was amazing. Fresh, fresh fish and surprisingly the japanese braised short ribs were to die for. Service however...not so much. Our waitress had trouble listening to us, it was as if every time we asked her a question she want miles around the bush and never answered. She was in her own world and for the money that we paid for our dinner I expected much more! And also, it was extremely DEAD there I mean we got there for a 730pm reservation and left around 10 and im pretty sure it was just us..... 
CONCLUSION: go for the food well worth it but be prepared to experience not worth it service"}
{"text":"We used to love Roka Akor and considered it one of the best restaurants in the city. For several years, we went regularly. But the last three visits in 2014 (yes I gave it several chances!!) were so very disappointing. The fish was not fresh. You could see and smell that it was not up to par. On the second of these 3 visits, my husband got sick. He would not return there with me. But I gave it one more chance and went with a girlfriend who is a major sushi foodie and world traveler. When I ordered, I specifically told the server what had happened on the previous visit -- that the fish was not fresh, and asked that they please be scrupulous in giving us the freshest food. But again, the chirashi roll was not fresh. The other items were similarly unworthy. Unfortunately, I'm done with the place."}
{"text":"Dear Roka
We have definitely gone in different directions.. Epic fail on the bar food service tonight. Manager on duty tried to save this relationship however too late.. Not looking for a free meal..
It will be a while before you see me again.
Disappointment from a former fan."}
{"text":"This was our second time to Roka Akor and it was just a great as the first.  I don't know why we waited so long to go back . . . maybe because it is a little further from home than some of our other Japanese/Sushi hangouts.  

We went during restaurant week. The special menu was lovely -- and that was what my hubby chose. His Butterfish Tataki with Yuzu-Shallot Dressing was heavenly. The Ribeye with Wafu and Garlic Chips was delicate - no knife needed.  And the dessert of Exotic Fruit and House-Made Mango Sorbet was so colorful and delicious, and so pretty, it looked like it should stay just put!  When I saw the Yuzu Miso Marinated Black Cod with Pickled Red Onions on the menu, I said \"no thank you\" to the Restaurant Week menu.  OMG, it was divine. Black cod is almost a delicacy . . . we've try to replicate this dish at home . . . no way. All the meals came with the side of Japanese Wild Mushroom Rice Hotpot. I've never quite tasted anything like it.  It's similar to wild mushroom risotto, only better and more flavorful. Since we were celebrating my birthday, they served up a freebie of baked green tea custard. It was uniquely refreshing and the perfect end to a delectable meal!

Service was spot on . . . just attentive enough without smothering. The space itself is beautifully designed with various different areas to sit in according to your mood.  The atmosphere is upscale, along with the prices, but don't let that deter you from going.  You can make it a special occasion restaurant!"}
{"text":"Roka used to be a favorite for their unbelievable happy hour. Great selection of excellent food and reasonable prices
Well sadly no more. Selection slashed to ten items with prices jacked 35% or more. 
I am not alone as there were 3 people there at the usual busy hh time. What a very 
Very disappointing change for the worse"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi - I think it's the highest quality in AZ. 
I came down for Happy Hour, and started with the Duck with Udon. It was so savory and delicious, we ordered it again!
We then moved to the Butterfish Tataki and then the Chef's Sashimi Platter. Everything was great. The bartenders took  great care of us. Adam was a knowledgable and kind host.
I ended the meal with the Unagi - my big test for quality sushi. It was lean and salty and perfection. 
Bravo, Roka! I can't wait to come down and try the Sunday Brunch!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Certainly has a spot on my list of all-time favorite restaurants. Decor is amazing. The open kitchen concept really works here. Server was incredibly knowledgeable not only about the menu, but also the origins of the food and cooking methods.

The food blew us away. Had the Kobe dumplings and Miso soup to start. Tremendous flavor. The Mushroom \"risotto\" is a must try. Everything was delicious and we tried several dishes.

Although very appetizing, don't expect a plate full of food. This restaurant actual serves food equal to one portion, not three like you see at most restaurants. And because of that, I imagine some may see Roka as too expensive for the amount of food served per dish (unless you have a Groupon)

Nonetheless, this place is a must-go. We will be back, many many times."}
{"text":"Excellent definitely do he chefs seasonal tasting menu, the duck pot is amazing! Fresh fish galore and great service but go hungry it's a lot of food!"}
{"text":"The Phoenician concierge recommended Roku. It is a few miles from the hotel and east of camelback. 
We had the sashimi deluxe. 16 pieces elegantly presented. This is not going to fill up two people but it is delightful for a light entre. Add soup and another side and you have good meal. The sashimi was fish that we may never experience back on Washington DC. That dish was $135 alone so be prepared. The presentation was up to the value.
Service was attentive and efficient. The room can get loud but that's part of the ambience.  Got a free desert for the yelp check in"}
{"text":"This place was incredible.  The staff was friendly, not pretentious, and very knowledgable. I don't know what it was called, but our group ordered a tray which was a sampler platter and had a bit of everything on it.  So fresh!  We also tried the sushi with the caviar on top.  Try the sake that they recommend (flown in from Japan - they are the only ones in PHX that carry it).  I'm not a sake fan but I loved it.  That's how good it was."}
{"text":"This is again when I wish yelp would have 1/2 star options. We would give this place 4.5 stars. 
We got the Omakase. Which is the chefs tastin menu. Started off with some shishito peppers, kushi oysters, assorted sashimi poke, prime rib roll-ups, wagyu beef & kimchi dumplings (my absolute favorite of everything we got) then on to bone marrow w/ pesto sauce on a crostini (great combination), mussels w/ a very tasty broth, sashimi platter, miso black cod (melts in your mouth), Australian wagyu beef (they do have Japanese wagyu at higher prices but the Australian came with the meal & it was good but not great) & then to top it all off we got the most amazing desert ever! 2 lava cakes, 1 with green tea Grenache & 2nd w/ dark chocolate & salted Carmel Grenache as well as a peanut butter & banana gelato which was to die for! 
Gunna go die fat & happy now haha. 

Our server Brad, although new, was exceptional. Likewise with the server assistant."}
{"text":"Good, not great.  (Maybe I'm spoiled being from Los Angeles)

Miso Soup = 2/5 - too salty!
Nigiri = Sake 5/5 - tons of flavor, ShimaAji 4/5 - good, Hamachi 3/5 - meh
Oyster = Chelsea Gem 5/5 - creamy and perfect

Grilled Scallops = 3/5 - grilled perfectly, needed salt
Pork Belly w/ roasted yellow beets = 3/5 - pork was just ok, but the beets were on point.

Ease = 5/5
Service = 5/5
Ambiance = 5/5

Overall, the place is awesome.. they just need to step up their food."}
{"text":"So good.  Sooo Sooo good!

The highlights:
-wagyu was insanely delicious
-oysters were amazing
-drink list is extensive and appropriately priced
-black cod was outstanding
-husband loved the potstickers
-salmon sashimi was amazeballs
-as always, the butterfish was solid
-service rocked!

The not-so-highlights:
-ran out of uni
-truffle king crab hot pot was just okay (don't get me wrong, I'd still eat it!)

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It's interesting to watch a restaurant like Roka Akor evolve.  The BF and I have eaten here four times since it opened last summer.  The food has always been exceptional and the décor is stunning in its simplicity.  It's no surprise this restaurant is linked to one in London.  The minimalist décor is reminiscent of the simplicity of Ozumo in San Francisco.  It's worth a visit just to sit in the serene setting and enjoy its aesthetic perfection.  \"Bon Appetit\" magazine named Roka Akor one of the 10 best places for sushi in the US in its April 2009 edition.  

The good news is that the pricing has been adjusted to better align with the current economic situation.  Don't get me wrong.  Roka Akor is still spendy.  Dinner for three ran over $300.  The great news is that they now run a happy hour special every day from 3:30 to 6:30 and again from 9:00 to close.  You have to sit in the bar or on the patio, but they offer half price apps and drinks.  The BF and I are stoked because this means we can frequent this place without having to justify the expense.  The Salmon Avocado Roll is a steal for $5.  The Roka Akor Burgers looked awesome and they are just $1.  As far as the drinks go, this place specializes in shochu infusions.  The Hani-P'ru is an amazing combo of honey comb shochu and fresh pineapple.  They go down WAY too easy and they've even better during happy hour at $6 vs. $12 on the dinner menu; especially when you have three.  Yum!

Our most recent meal was superb.  The food was literally pitch perfect.  The Butternut Squash with Japanese Pepper Broth ($8) was excellent.  Ask them to make the pepper broth spicy like they used.  The spice creates a perfect balance with the fried squash.  Also, don't let this dish linger on the table as the fried pieces can get soggy if you leave them in the broth too long.  The Seasonal Vegetables and Seafood ($15) tempura offered up three delicious prawns as the stars of this dish.  The 3 Sashimi Chef's Selection ($17.50) offered two pieces each of salmon, yellowtail and big eye tuna.  The sashimi was utterly perfect, but don't believe the menu when it classifies this dish as a \"large\" sashimi plate.  We had to order two of them for the three of us.  For sushi, we selected the Salmon Avocado Roll ($12) and the Crispy Prawn Roll ($12) and both were excellent.  We then moved on to items from the Robata grill, which is the main feature of the display kitchen.  The 8 oz. Grilled Prime Beef Fillet with Chili Ginger Sauce ($28) was utterly fantastic and I could have had just this dish as my entire meal.  It was superb, beefy perfection!  We added some of the robata grilled skewers and I really like that the restaurant now offers these by the piece so you can mix and match your sides.  We had the Sweet Potato with Ginger Teriyaki and Sesame skewers ($2.50 each), the Cremini Mushrooms with Garlic and Butter skewers ($2 each) and the Sweet Corn with Butter and Soy skewers ($2 each).  The corn skewers were delightful with just the right char on the niblets.

We decided to try a dessert since they wisely re-vamped this part of the menu.  Previously, the desserts were fairly dreadful in the traditional Asian dessert way, but that has been thankfully addressed.  We tried the Warm Toffee Cake with Peanut Butter Ice Cream and Caramelized Peanuts ($12).  The peanut butter ice cream was amazing and actually tasted like peanut butter with a super silky texture.  The caramelized peanuts were also excellent and had great crunch.  The one area that needs work in the toffee cake.  All three of us noticed it was a bit grainy and gritty.  When I mentioned this to our waiter, he went to the kitchen and came back to the table to tell us it was made with almond flour and chunky peanut butter.  I suggested they work on the texture as the taste of the dish was spot on.

The service is also superb at Roka Akor.  Our waiter has served us three times now and he is attentive and helpful without being intrusive.  He is excellent at helping to navigate the menu and his recommendations are utterly reliable.  When I spilled some soy sauce on my silk shirt he immediate appeared at the table with a wash cloth that had been soaked in club soda for me.  That's service worthy of 20% tip on a $300+ check.

Roka Akor has hit its stride for sure.  Try this place and hit the happy hour to appeal to the recessionista in you."}
{"text":"We started our meal with the crispy squid, grilled scallops, pork belly, and Serrano-hamachi roll, and seared salmon nigiri.  All were really, really good. The scallops were huge and perfectly cooked, pork belly so tasty, the hamachi roll was a delicious revelation, and the salmon so buttery and soft. The only one I probably would not order again is the squid, but not because there was anything wrong with it, it was just completely outshined by the other dishes.  

I had the 12oz ribeye (cooked to a perfect medium-rare, so tender and well-seasoned), my husband had the Madagascan prawn (that thing was a foot long, btw!!!) and we shared a side of the cremini mushrooms (which I thought were average, but my husband raved about). Dessert was a moist, warm banana cake topped with a ginger-chocolate sauce and almond ice cream. Didn't get much of an almond flavor there, but the rest of it was good. 

We really enjoyed our experience at Roka Akor, and would not hesitate to return again. It IS a little pricey, but going at happy hour helps."}
{"text":"It was ok. My husband took me here on a date night, and I wasn't overly impressed. It was just...strange. Not my cup o' tea..."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites! I love the miso soup, and would die for the bone marrow! Love his place!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here a few times each month since it opened.  Because we are regulars, nearly all the servers recognize us and it is a great feeling to know you are among friends and are appreciated in a restaurant. We have been ignored by some of the most professional servers in the finest restaurants in the world - at ten times the price.  So we value our experiences at Roka.  We also love they are on Opentable.com so we get our points. The bar is wonderfully comfortable when it's not too crowded.  The food is consistently good and well presented.  Things move a bit slower when you have diners who have not been to the restaurant before and the servers have to explain every nuance of the place.  Despite that, the set-up is appealing, giving diners the option of the Sushi Bar or real dining tables.  Great for groups.  A fun experience.  The servers are professional and cordial.  Parking can be a bit challenging but going outside normal dining times can prevent those issues.  

Please dress appropriately.  Tank tops and flip flops are NOT appropriate attire for this restaurant.  This is Scottsdale and resort chic is appreciated.  If you look as if you just came from the pool, you are not adequately dressed.  

Otherwise, don't miss Roka Akor.  The vast menu is outstanding - nearly everything on the menu is worth having more than once.  If you have the Chicken Teriyaki, ask them to remove the skin and slice it down the middle for bite-size eating, particularly if you are using chopsticks.  Otherwise, it is difficult to manage."}
{"text":"Dear Roka Akor,

I want this to be a love letter but it's not. We had such a short relationship but I feel we have to break up.

I spent $200 at dinner for 3 ozs of fish, one appetizer, and two drinks. And the worst part was it didn't even taste very good. 

Our waiter was obsequiously friendly and recommended that if I was a sushi connoisseur I should have the best sushi. Fine, OK, I hear Roka that you are a top 10 sushi restaurant in USA. I have had sushi at some of the others, let's see how you stack up. I am willing to pay for quality.

Your sashimi was of questionably quality, marinated to perdition in order to hide the fishy taste that only emerges when fish begins to rot. The fatty tuna was regular tuna. The portions were tiny! Seriously about 3 ozs of fish for two orders of the chef's choice best sashimi. Some of the flavors of the marinates were quite good, I give you that. But just like spandex does not make the obese look sexy, so vinegar and soy does not make low quality fish sexy. I have eaten fish off the boat at the fish market in Tokyo, not only were you not nearly as good, you weren't even nearly as good as some conveyor belt dining sushi I've had. Don't tell me this is the best you can do!

I must have looked like I had money, or looked too blonde (I'm a brunette btw), because the happy hour menu was never mentioned. Happy hour prices were in effect but the one appetizer I ordered which should have been covered by the happy hour menu was charged at full price. 

I couldn't run away from you fast enough. Return? No. Why would I want to return to an abusive relationship?"}
{"text":"Alright, this review is going to be lengthy so I will post a TL;DR at the end.

I called in today around 5pm and asked for a reservation for 6, the hostess told me that they are totally booked for tonight, and I asked if there was anything they could do. She told me she could squeeze us in at 5:45. That's all I needed to hear. I rushed over to Scottsdale and got there at exactly 5:45. We were seated immediately. The overall ambiance of this place was very pleasant. The atmosphere was modern, the lighting was great, and the staff were extremely friendly.

I can't for the life of me remember the name of our waiter, but he was extremely polite, professional, and knowledgeable of the menu. I went for the Omakase (I'll leave it up to you, Chef's Choice) and LET ME JUST SAY, I'M DEFINITELY GLAD I DID. 

The Omakase started with the Butterfish Tataki w/ White Asparagus and Yuzu. This melted in my mouth like butter and the flavors were deep and complex, very enjoyable.

Next was the Shishito Peppers w/ Ponzu and Bonito Flakes. The peppers had great flavor and were grilled to perfection. Definitely a nice follow-up to the Butterfish.

Then we had the seasonal Oysters, but since I'm not a big fan, I asked the waiter if the chef could swap it out for something else instead. Boy did the Chef deliver.

The Sashimi Platter was definitely a highlight. Our waiter brought us some sushi ready rice as a side for the platter to compliment the sashimi. We had Salmon, Yellowtail, Amberjack, and 4 large pieces of Premium Fatty Tuna (O Toro) to substitute the Oysters. The fish was nice and fatty and had amazing flavor. The rice was extremely light and tasty. Combined it was an awesome part of the overall courses.

Prime Beef Tataki w/ Truffle Jus and Pickled Shallots was OUT OF THIS WORLD! The flavor was incredible and the meat was nice and tender, cooked to perfection. It melted like butter in my mouth. The umami flavor was noticeable in this dish.

Then came one of the best courses of the whole night. Boiled Snow Crab w/ the most amazing Yuzu/Ponzu glaze/marinade ever! OH MY GOD IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD! So juicy and tender... man, just absolutely out of this world.

Yuzu/Miso Marinated Black Cod w/ Pickled Onions had the most intense umami flavor out of all of the dishes I had tonight. The Cod had already been seared w/ the marinade, but it also had a nice amount on the plate as well for a more intense flavor. Mix in some sweet pickled onions on top and talk about a taste bud experience. All the flavors blended well together for something absolutely unique.

Crispy Brussel Sprouts w/ Japanese Mustard and Bonito was next. The flavor was rich w/ the mustard and bonito complimented w/ the bold flavor of the Brussel Sprouts. This was a dish that shined for sure.

The Pork Belly with Black Garlic Miso and Pickled Grapes was another umami experience. The salty and fatty pieces of pork belly combined with the sour/sweet pickled grapes and the umami flavored garlic miso sauce merged into the perfect trifecta of flavors.

THE GRAND FINALE WAS THE JAPANESE GRADE A5+ WAGYU BEEF W/ HAWAIIAN SALT, TRUFFLE SALT, AND SMOKED CURRY SALT. HOLY SHIT THIS WAS EASILY THE JUICIEST, BUTTERY, TENDER, MELT IN YOUR MOUTH STEAK I HAVE EVER HAD. IT WAS COOKED MEDIUM RARE (RECOMMENDED) AND HAD GREAT FLAVOR W/ OR W/O THE DIFFERENT SALT OPTIONS. THE PRESENTATION WAS INCREDIBLE AND THE EXECUTION WAS UNFORGETTABLE. 

Lastly, we had the assorted dessert platter w/ fresh fruit (Strawberry, Raspberry, Blueberry, Blackberry, Cantaloupe, Honey Dew Melon, Watermelon, Kiwi). It also included a yuzu lemonade sorbet that was INCREDIBLY, a raspberry mango sorbet that was sensational, a Matcha Green Tea Flan w/ Passion-fruit macaroons that was light and flavorful, and a chocolate souffle w/ peanut butter ice cream and candied peanuts on top to die for.  

They also have a Yuzu Lemonade that is $7 but worth every cent it's soooooo good!

TL;DR Standout dishes were the Prime Rib Tataki, Boiled Snow Crab, Pork Belly, and Wagyu Steak. All in all, this was a 10/10 dining experience as we sat for 3 hours enjoying this unbelievable Omakase. If you go, trust the chef and get the most out of your restaurant experience."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best restaurants we have been too. We are from nyc so we have been exposed to the best cuisines but this gem in Arizona is to die for. Every item we ordered was extremely flavorful with exceptional ingredients. They have really put in a lot of effort in getting the right dish with the right flavors. Everything just melts in your mouth. 
Service is excellent as well- very friendly and down to earth staff."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about with regard to the food -- it was flippin fantastic! The waiter was exceptional until after our entree course was delivered. After then, he could care less that we were there and moved on to other tables. He left us with the overworked backwaiter who, to his credit, tried, but was overwhelmed. We would have ordered desert, but after waiting a half hour for someone to come back decided to leave."}
{"text":"Yelpers you did not let me down! We had a party of six and arrived early for \"happy hour\" in the bar/lounge area.  With half off appetizers it was plenty for us to eat and we got to taste over half the menu!   The appetizer list is pretty extensive - the chicken and beef skewers were tasty, the sushi was decent , and the vegetables were yummy.  I did not care for the kimchee potstickers, but credit for being different !
 
The one menu item we ordered was a rice hot pot that came with a variety of mushrooms, and some other vegetables all mixed with the rice.  It doesn't look that great, but it does taste good!  We peeked at the dinner menu and it did not look as interesting as all of the appetizers! When we left the bar was crowded and the restaurant was about half full (but it was still relatively early)

Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Roka has great food, but I only go there for happy hour, since it's a much better value for the money.  I am not sure $46 for a filet was worth it, I'd rather go to Capital Grille for the steak for that money."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the top restaurants in the Phoenix Metro area. Period. Consistently impressive and a great place to take guests or have that special occasion meal."}
{"text":"We were told they fly in fish daily from server. 

Quite expensive but your not buying bagels here."}
{"text":"With all honesty, this place is more a 3.5 than but when it comes to round up, it's closer to 3.

I have mixed feelings about the decor. It's nice, simple, cool, but the round tables are huge and build a barrier for conversation or interaction. The bathroom wasn't that clean and the place in general seems to be getting old.

The food was kind of hit and miss. The fried tofu was good but be careful, it's super hot. The salad that comes with it was awesome.

The sushi rolls weren't that great at all. The wygu tartar which was supposed to be their best one according to two waiters was barely a 2 star. The spicy tuna also really uneventful.

The highlight was the lamb chops. They worth the visit!

The green tea desert was weird and nothing memorable.

The service was friendly and good. 

The prices are steep specially if you drink. We had a bottle of wine, a pinot noir from the Willamette Valley which wasn't that great at all.

A good place for a date but if you're craving great food for a decent price, this is not your place.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Great high end sushi and Japanese. The fish tastes so much different than your garden variety sushi joints of the world. It tastes like real fish and each is unique! The presentation is a work of art, the staff is great and they even have their own brand of liquor. We did the chefs tasting menu a while back. Was very unique with things I would not normally order and very good. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"My review is long over due, but I have to review this place because the food was so phenomenal. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday (March 1st) and we did Omakase - which means \"trust the chef\". They basically send out whatever dishes they feel like. It is quite pricey, but it's a TON of food and the quality was incredible. Each individual dish is small but you fill up fast. The first round was fish. The first dish we got was butterfish... The fish literally melted in your mouth, it was so good. We also had two different oyster dishes (I never get to eat oysters and these were awesome), scallops, and the freshest sashimi I've ever eaten. I literally still dream about that sashimi, it completely blew my mind. Then we had meat - some nice pork belly bites, bone marrow (yum!), and super high quality beef. Our server said the beef (wagu? Wagoo?) was the best quality they had ever served. It was thin and juicy and included 3 unique dipping salts. The dessert was awesome as well. Hard to describe, but I will include a picture. It had lots of fresh fruit, 2 different sorbets and ice cream. The waiter also gave us a complimentary blondie for my birthday! This was honestly the best meal I've ever had. Every dish was extremely fresh and presented beautifully, and the servers described each one in detail. I highly recommend doing Omakase, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Ribeye was so so but the butterfish and fried scallops were amazing! Service was spot on and were very friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and experience! We took the Omakase plunge and were not disappointed. A couple surprises included foei gras (duck liver), raw scallops, and cod cooked in a large leaf. All tasted amazing. The sake recommendation by our waitress was spot on. Overall it was worth it!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, my roll had serrano peppers, avocado and was the house special.  It was certainly good sushi, I've had better but not by much.  Our server was great, the place had a cool hip feel to it.  I really enjoyed it, not quite enough to get me up to 5 stars, but very good."}
{"text":"This is another of my many reviews based solely on their happy hour and sitting at the bar.

First let me say that this place is COOL. Interior decor in a blondish wood. Jaw dropping selection of Saki and a very eclectic drink menu, much of which is included in their happy hour WHICH INCLUDES WEEKENDS.

Their rolls are all amazing. Again, many included in their happy hour at deeply discounted prices.

Funny enough the thing that has my wife and I coming back again and again are these damn little burgers for two bucks each. HOLY SH*T are they good. I mean come on... how good can they be? THAT F-ING GOOD is how good. God in Heaven smiles at me when I order them. Yikes."}
{"text":"This place is kind of hit or miss especially with the sushi its more of a 3 and a half stars but yelp dpesnt have an option for that biy anyway the steak was good from what a had tried from another person who didnt get sushi someone also got lobster which also was pretty good also the kim chi dumplings were good and relatively cheap but the sushi was mediocre the salmon and avocado roll was not good the seaweed was very strong and tough and there wasn't avocado but a lot of cucumber which overpowered any salmon or rice taste but on the other hand the sashimi I got was good put very small in portion the chef gave me 3 slices of fish but the waiter said most people only get 2 but even then 3 small slices of fish and some wasabi is a little overpriced the wasabi seemed real which was the best part of the sushi I'm guessing if you got 3 to 4 orders of sashimi would be the best bet for the sashimi but that would be $40+ for 8 pieces of fish overall this places rolled sushi needs a lot of improvement but everything else was decent."}
{"text":"After the disappointment of dining at Quiessence, I decided to try a sushi restaurant in the middle of the desert! Before you all shake your head and laugh, I had checked out their menu and figuring that they also have other branches around the world, they must be doing something right.

The restaurant is located out on N Scottsdale Rd and has ample parking. The interior of the restaurant is big and airy, unlike its London counterpart, which has tables crammed up together. There is a bar area where they carve the big pieces of ice on which the fresh fish is served. The main restaurant area is dominated by the open plan robata grill. As I was dining on my own, I chose to sit at the grill to watch/chat to the friendly chefs and to make friends. There was a good buzz about the place.

I got a shock though when I opened the menu. I had my heart set on having the tasting menu to sample more dishes but the tasting menu was for a minimum of 2 people. Being the USA where the customer is king (please note, all UK restaurant owners!), I decided to ask the server to find out from the kitchen whether I would be able to have the tasting menu on my own as I had come all the way from London. I was so pleased when the server returned with a positive answer.

Well, the generosity of the restaurant knew no bounds. I am sure that they served me the equivalent amount of food for 2 people with double portions of everything. I was starting to panic as the never-ending sea of food kept flowing out of the kitchen - I hate to return uneaten food to the kitchen but there was no way I was going to be able to eat all of it. Fortunately, I made friends with the diners on either side of me and between us, we did manage to eat it all.

Having had some misgivings about eating sushi in the middle of the desert, I found out from the chefs that all the food is specially flown in, mostly from abroad, so even the London branch would be getting its fish from Japan rather than Billingsgate.

Once service started, dish after dish just flowed out of the kitchen, all beautifully presented.

1. Butterfish tataki - lovely delicate fish which possibly needed an accent like ginger.

2. Spinach salad with peanut dressing - refreshing.

3. Rock shrimp tempura with chilli mayonnaise. Very light batter enclosing just cooked shrimp.

4. Premium sushi including my favourite melt in your mouth toro. Mmmmmmm.

5. Wagyu gunkan with caviar. My only disappointment of the menu. I think the flavour of the super expensive beef was wasted in this preparation. Was even hard to tell it was beef. I appreciate the expense but perhaps they could do a different preparation.

6. Spicy tuna roll. Lovely.

Then came the robata grilled dishes.

7. Sweet potato. Was a bit sceptical that it would cook enough on the grill but it was lovely and crispy.

8. Black cod. Which Japanese restaurant doesn't have a version of this dish popularised by Nobu? Still wonderful with large flakes of white fish accompanied by that lovely sweet sticky sauce.

9. Lamb chops with Korean spices. Huge meaty chops but moist and tender.

10. Rice pot offered with vegetables or king crab. Had to be the crab though I was ready to explode by this stage! This was something new that I have never seen before. Probably best described like Japanese risotto where the crab was mixed into creamy rice and a generous amount of tobiko added some pops. There was an incredible depth of flavour that I suspect comes from a proper stock.

Last but not least and I'm afraid I may have actually laughed out loud when dessert arrived. It was the most fabulous looking and enormous dessert selection served on a block of ice. I can't actually remember what was on there - my stomach may have been telling my brain to abort at this stage! However, I had a taste of everything and like the rest of the meal, it was divine.

So top marks to Roka Akor for flexibility and their generosity for feeding me and my 2 impromptu dining partners. I was happy to escape the fate of the exploding man in Monty Python's Meaning of Life sketch ('just a little wafer, monsieur') but it was the quality of the food, not its quantity which captured my stomach's praise.

I was able to chat to the Scandinavian head chef later, who extracted a promise from me to go and try the London branch and let him have my honest opinion. Well, Scottsdale wins, guys! You have a more spacious restaurant, more friendly staff, amazing flexibility in customer service and more generosity with the dishes (London's 'premium' menu sushi selection only included salmon, tuna and yellowtail - no sign of any toro) And to achieve this in the middle of the desert!"}
{"text":"We went here over the weekend and attempted to order multiple things only to be told they were \"out\" of all of them. I understand that things may run out over a busy weekend, but typical server etiquette is to inform diners of this as soon as they are seated. We ended up leaving and going to Houston's for better, reliable service."}
{"text":"A hip Japanese restaurant with a wide range of selections form ravioli to sushi to steak.  Unique interpretations of often offered selections.  One of the better restaurants in the Valley.  Bring your credit card."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went there totally on a whim because we'd heard all the hype about the Shoshu bar and the food.  Well its all true -- we just loved it.  We were starving when we got there and ordered edamame and a couple of drinks.  I had the Rose Petal Martini which was pretty good - I have no idea what Hubby had...  We did try a round of the Shoshu sampler and some were great (tangerine, and lime were awesome) a couple others were not my fave's but thats life.  

Then we ordered a bunch of things:  the butterfish tataki was out of this world, the wagyu beef roll was yummy and a round of sashimi.  The sashimi was the bomb but actually the fresh rice was amazing!  We then got some tempura and some steak which rounded us off.  

You need to know that they don't rush you here.  This is a leisurely dinner pace (read: LONG) so plan on that.  We will definitely be coming back.  I'm craving rice and that butterfish!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was excellent. Had the filet which was prepared perfectly but nothing came with it. Truffle mushrooms were fantastic. Tuna sampler was ok. Not worth $50. Service was also good. 

Overall, grossly overpriced for what you get so I'm giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  I've been eating sushi since I was a child and this is one of my fave places!  Roka is definitely a tad on the pricey side, but it is so worth it!  I don't know what training their wait staff attend, but every restaurant needs to copy them!  They are always courteous, friendly, and very informative.  The staff knows exactly what is on the menu at all time, including the specials, will inquire about your likes and dislikes and find something that you will enjoy.  I've brought a few friends here who had never ate sushi and each occasion the staff eases their apprehensions, found items they think my friends will enjoy, and they always leave being my new sushi buddies!  The food is delicious and I've never ate a single item I didn't love here.  I have traveled the world for both leisure and work, and this is definitely one of my favorite restaurants I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Unique Happy Hour appetizers...and delicious!  Great mixed drinks.  We have eaten in the restaurant many times, but this was our first time sitting at the bar.  Can't wait to go back.  My mouth is watering for the cod skewers, the crusted sea bass with dipping sauce and salts, and the pork belly."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was an off night or what, but def not impressed. We chose this location after viewing all the Yelp reviews...Yelpers you let me down:-( This place sucked! If it weren't for the fact that we got here so late we would've gone to a different restaurant. We ordered quite a huge variety and actually asked the waitress to recommend all the well reviewed by customer dishes. They were either bland or not memorable. As we were staying at The Phoenician it was a bit of a trek and not worth it in the slightest. I def would not go back or recommend."}
{"text":"As a preface, this place has one of the best things i have ever eaten, the chibi mushroom slider, and the quality of the menu is first rate. I've been to Roka Akor 10+ times in the last few years, and I have never experienced service so bad.  After talking this place up to an out of town guest during the entire 15 minute drive over, we sat ourselves in the bar area, where the floor manager graciously assisted us with moving tables around for our party of three.  From that point on, we only interacted with the staff 3 times over the course of the next half hour: once to order our drinks, 25 minutes later when our drinks actually arrived, and immediately thereafter when I flagged down a passing waitress and handed her my credit card to close us out.  I'm not a particularly demanding man, but we visited at 9 o'clock on a Saturday night and it was not especially packed.  Other tables were receiving the usual solid service.  Meanwhile, my room mate and I were embarrassed in front of our guest.  Roka is good, but on principal I'll be steering clear of the Scottsdale location from here on.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here for the happy hour specials --- ended up paying as much or even more than what we would pay in a $$$ restaurant for 2 people (we only ordered from the happy hour menu) Pretty pricey I must say, but everything we ordered was just great! You have to trying this place!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had...incredibly fresh, delicate, and tasteful. I am so in love with this place. Everything about it is wonderful. For apps, think we had the calamari, Brussels sprouts, and sweet potatoes. They were all so good I think I blacked out from the flavor...I shall be back when my wallet increases in size."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty, and creative in presentation. The sushi is really good, probably some of the best in AZ. The house sake and the rice vodka drink they do is pretty good. I'll go again."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants I have ever been to.  Do not go here if you are seeking some generic maki rolls.  The selection is very limited and did not taste all that great.  Appetizers and drinks are great.  The bar/lounge area is a great place to go on a date.  Sushi bar layout was nice as well.  

Definitely not a casual place to go for dinner.  Love being on the expense code.  You go here for the japanese grill.  Get the specials for the night.  Mine was a kobe beef stuffed with some crap it tasted so delicious... yum..."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow probably the best sushi I've ever had let's start with the dumplings I would say it's in my top 10 favorite foods I've ever had such a unique flavor the beef in it literally melts as you eat it the sauce that comes on side not even sure how to describe it I just wanted to drink it so next time I'll get two of those for my appetizer had the vegetable tempura average probably when I get it again the rolls or very good start off with the the rainbow roll it wasn't your typical cheap rainbow roll All Fresh fish reveri good flavor is way different than anyone I've ever had second roll was the Camacho Serrano next time I would skip it  California roll was one of the best I've ever had they're just different no cheap imitation anything just really fresh the unagi role is probably my favorite but I think it was shrimp that was fried with eel but you'll sauce and I think avocado that one was fantastic really pricey though at 18 bucks but worth it now for the entree my son had the beef fillet it was okay I expected way more when not get steak here now the black cod that was some serious fish thing was amazing it was like butter and crispy it was simply Delicious nothing like I've ever had and fish before maybe cuz I never really had Cod before fatty crispy how can you go wrong my son had that chocolate cake he said it was really good at least the caramel almond filling didn't have that not for the service that's what you'd expect from a place like this John I think was our server he was on top of everything very genuine with this service just drank my son a little bit makes you feel very comfortable was able to tell me everything about any menu item I wanted when he asks if you want to add something he told you the price which is great because a lot of places they just at it cuz he wants her ticket bigger very good experience and definitely go back it is pretty pricey though and Susie is not the cheapest anyways expect the pay double then anywhere you go for sushi"}
{"text":"Roka is definitely on the high end spectrum of Japanese restaurants and for good reason. I will say the menu is pricey but they have a good happy hour if you sit in the bar. The salmon nigiri was perfect and the pork belly melts in your mouth(literally)."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Roka Akor for years and finally did last night. The main reason why I cannot give this higher stars is due to the service. Just as a few others mentioned in the reviews the service needs work. 
Some of the food was amazing and others were good at best. 
We ordered four different types of roles. They didn't taste bad but I've had much better for less money. 
We ordered the fried tofu dish. This was very original and tasted great. 5 stars all the way
We had the Japanese mushroom hot pot. I would give this 4 stars. It tasted good and the presentation was pretty cool

Now back to the service. The waiter we had gave very short and a bit rude responses to every question we asked. Forgot a few drink orders and wasn't around much. He either had a bad day or treats everyone like this. Either way, I have high standards when it comes to service at an upscale restaurant. If the food sucked and the service was great, it wouldn't be as bad. As opposed to okay food and terrible service. 

I won't be back"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. From the service to the food, everything was incredible. My sisters and I dined at Roka Akor for a birthday celebration and they did not disappoint. Our server, Wesley, was so knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. Everything on the menu sounded great so we asked for recommendations from Wesley. We ended up ordering everything that he suggested plus salmon sashimi. Each item was unbelievably fresh and flavorful. Highlights were the beef tataki, butterfish tataki, hamachi roll, salmon sashimi, and black cod. Drinks were great too.  I have eaten at some very good sushi restaurants, Nobu and Morimoto, and Roka Akor was easily better than both. Go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Roka Akor is the new best place for sushi in town!  Helluva drive but hella worth it.

The decor is absolutely stunning and a great place to go on those dates/anniversaries/birthdays/whatever days.  We asked for sushi bar seating and was seated right away.  The seating gave us a great view of their chef working on the sushi  rolls and they definitely were a piece of art.  Salmon sashimi served on a honking slab of ice??? Ingenious!!

Didn't get a chance to try the kobe beef or the hot pot but the sushi was excellent.  Sapporo beer rounded out the awesome meal and the Tokyopolitan the girlfriend had was worth the money.  

You pay for what you get and Roka Akor is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"It was fantastic! Great customer service the food was delicious. I would go there again - no doubt."}
{"text":"High quality fish and great service. They are now the source for top quality sashimi in the valley. It's hip and a good date spot."}
{"text":"Possibly the best restaurant in Scottsdale - if not all of Arizona. I don't even know where to begin. I just love this place.

I came here for a quick lunch and ended up having a multi-course dining experience full of decadent food, eclectic drinks and wonderful service. I think I even got a little drunk. It was 1 PM, so that's always nice. Basically I ate and ate and ate and ate and ate and I can't wait to eat here again.

Some highlights:

Great lunch tasting menu - also love the a la carte menu

Love that there are three kitchens. You can get fresh sushi, salads or yummy hot dishes

REAL green tea! Green tea is my favorite drink and I can't stand when inauthentic flavoring is used. Roka uses actual green tea. Yay!

The most delicious black cod EVER

The most delicious butterfish EVER

The most delicious asparagus EVER!

Lobster dumplings

An amazingly HUGE and tasty Prawn dinner

Great sushi - fresh, delicious

A great drink menu including an array of soju drinks

Interesting mix of non-alcoholic drinks (apple mojito with no booze)

They carry my favorite beer. THANK YOU!

Impeccable service

Groovy looking clean bathrooms

Beautiful restaurant - love the atmosphere, dcor...etc

***BONUS - I think the table next to us didn't like the restaurant because the menu was too \"different.\" I hate that. If you want crappy food...go to Applebees A-holes! I'll keep Roka Akor to myself."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed last night in Roka Akor.  I know they are expensive and was prepared to splurge for great food, great service, and a fun night.  Luckily, my friends always make the latter happen.  The food was average, our drinks took 35 minutes, and our service was average."}
{"text":"I really love this place. I like that it is kind of tapa style so you can share with everyone at the table, but for those who don't like that sort of thing you can just get what you like. Everything is extremely fresh and the fact that they usually have Toro on the menu makes it that much better!"}
{"text":"The best sushi...the best sushi experience...the nicest interior design of any sushi restaurant I've ever been to. Roka rates in my Top 10 restaurants of all time. Right up there with CUT in Beverly Hills, Picasso in Las Vegas and Kai in AZ. It's hard to compare this place to any other Sushi restaurant because it would be like comparing a good Kobe Fillet to a regular fillet. Sure, they're both cows... but cummon. These guys get it right all the way around!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. Upon entering the restaurant and being seated, we found a bug on my menu and in my hair. We then waited over 10 minutes AFTER we ordered our drinks only to have them delivered with a bug in them! The manger took over and the service improved greatly. However, 12 hours later both my friend and I were laid up FOR DAYS, vomiting, diarrhea and unable to get out of bed. My friend had to be hospitalized and we are now, 7 days later, only able to eat small, soft items. STAY AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Roka Akor.  I am very picky with my sushi and Roka is truly top-notch!

Go for happy hour and order the Butterfish Tataki, burgers, Softshell crab with Mizuna, Hamachi Serrano Chili roll---those are all amazing. 

Off the Happy hour menu---the Pork Belly is fantastic, as well as the Kobe Beef.  

You really can't go wrong on the food here.  

I would have given this place 5 stars, but recently the young brunette girl at the front was very rude---when people walk in, please smile and be welcoming!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent dining experience. My wife and I were in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area for a spa getaway weekend and booked a reservation here on the recommendation of the hotel's knowledgeable concierges.

SERVICE: To me, the service is the real draw here. Initially I was let down to find that there is not a \"real\" sushi bar here. Their bar is more of a robata grill, while all the sushi items are prepared in the back. Since we were there to eat sushi, not the robata experience, we opted for a table. We ordered omakase ($98/head as of this writing), and were impressed that the chef actually came out to our table to discuss the evening's menu with us, inquiring as to what we like (sashimi and nigiri) and what we don't like (tempura and other fried stuff). He proceeded to detail what he was planning to serve us. That was nice, though due to his accent we only understood about half of it, smiling and enthusiastically nodding at the rest (doh!). 

Our waiter, Charles (who incidentally resembles, and even sounds like, a young Wayne Newton) was friendly, extremely capable and knowledgeable regarding every bit of the food as well as the sakes we tried. I highly recommend him!

Even the food runners were each able to explain what they were serving -- nice touch!

FOOD: (Mental note: must get in the habit of writing this stuff down while eating, before sake takes hold). If you're a big eater and you regularly order omakase, you know that, at least in a traditional sushi place, it's common for the food to run out slightly before your appetite does (depending on the chef and how much you're communicating with him). This was quite the opposite. We had 4 courses consisting of about 3 plates each. By the time dessert came, we were stuffed. 

I wish I could name everything we tried, but I can't -- the butterfish tataki is every bit as good as you've heard, as was the kobe beef and the 10 other things we tried. 

The thing that truly stuck out in my mind was the miso soup. This was easily the best miso soup I've ever had. Even if you don't do omakase -- make sure you try the miso soup!

(note to other tall people -- watch your knees. their tables have wooden panels underneath the table edge that hang pretty low)"}
{"text":"We made last minute reservations for here and they were able to accommodate us. The special was amazing, sushi rolls and sashimi were very fresh and tasty. The chef accommodated our request for a rainbow roll (not on the menu) which was so good that we ordered another. Perhaps the only complaint would be the noise level because it is such a busy place. The dining at bar looked like it would be fun and on our next visit I am going to try sitting there..."}
{"text":"This place has everything you want in a first class dining experience. the atmosphere is classy and refined.  The building is enormous but the tables are spread far apart for an intimate dining experience even if seated in the middle of the restaurant. Our server Eugine was not only knowledgeable but excited about the options on the menu and very attentive.
 This is hands down the best fish I've had in phoenix.  The Sashimi is fresh and served on a bed of crushed ice to ensure you get a crisp and delicious serving.  Being a sochu house, I tried some of their namesake.  My Sochu came with one large crystal clear ice cube that kept my beverage cold until it was finished. 
 Clearly no attention detail has been spared and they will ensure you enjoy your dining experience.  I only wish i could eat here more often."}
{"text":"Awesome bar happy hour with decent food offerings and drinks. Very cool interior and atmosphere. Restaurant is amazing too."}
{"text":"yummy - had the Wagyu steak flight & delicious thickly sliced Toro sashimi"}
{"text":"Oysters are so good I ate a dozen by myself. The Brussels sprouts are to die for, the bartenders are fantastic but with only 2 on a Friday night, a bit overwhelmed."}
{"text":"The menu was good and after reading several reviews we went with the Butterfish tatami and  yellow tail sashimi. We also enjoyed 3 tasty rolls and managed to squeeze in the chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream. Our server was excellent and we enjoyed the restaurant not being so loud."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Roka Akor after receiving a gift card for Christmas.  The atmosphere is great and it is beautiful inside, although the dining room was a bit loud.  The service was extremely slow and our server a little snobby.  We ordered the house sake/beer, 2 sushi rolls, 2 entrees and 1 dessert.  My $50 gift card barely made a dent in our bill.  I've had much better sushi and Japanese food elsewhere for much less.  The portions are small and the food unremarkable.  You are paying for the fancy Scottsdale ambience here.  We will stick with one of our favorites Yasu or Hana next time....they might be located in strip malls, but their sushi blows RA away."}
{"text":"This place is for those that just want to waste money. I went there and although the place is classy. The portions are small for the high prices they are asking and I just left feeling like I was still hungry. I went there with a large group of people and we all had separate tabs but for what you pay I was unsatisfied all together.Nice place and well decorated but I did not pay just for the atmosphere. I will go to other places before I come back to Roca Akor which I don't see being anytime soon. Thumbs down in my eyes."}
{"text":"I must say that I have been excited to go to Roka months ago when i learned that it was coming to Scottsdale.  I have friends in London that really like the place...So I finally had the opportunity to go to  Roka Akor last night... I walked in and it is beautifully decorated.  The smell from the Robatayaki grill,was a bit strong (yes, I am suffering from allergies) but I manage and find the place quite enjoyable.

The bartender gave us tastings of the fresh sochu  infused cocktails...Lime, pineapple, raspberry and honeycomb.  Honey comb was my favorite!  

What I liked was the small plates enough to share and to give you a taste of the food.....But I must say a little disappointed with the food.  Maybe I had too high of an expectation.  

Here is what we had:

- Lobster and Abalone dumplings - good, but i found the Abalone to be a bit chewy.
- Calamari- tasty but a bit over fried...didn't get the flavor of the squid.  
- Robata grilled eggplant - DELICIOUS!! 
- Tuna Tartar - SO good I loved the raw quail egg and caviar and how they made me mix it together. One tiny cracker accompanied the dish. A bit overpowering with the mustard...and it took 30+minutes to come to the table 
- Soft Shell Crab roll - okay, I liked that they used Kimchi in the roll, and it didn't overpower the roll.
- Black Cod - this was yummy, but there is a place down the street that i find there black cod to be a bit better.  I did like the presentation!

I am not sure if I am being hard on Roka Akor, maybe I was just so excited to get there and reading everyones reviews...I know that I will be going back.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and I would like to visit on the weekend and try some more food and have a sochu!"}
{"text":"The food and service are outstanding.

Had a great time.

Try:
- Pork Belly 
- Everything Else :)"}
{"text":"This was the best happy hour I've ever experienced. The service was attentive and friendly, the food was amazing and the prices were reasonable (though the bartender encouraged us to order waaaay too much food, not that I minded :))

We ordered:

-Edamame (surprisingly large portion)
-Shishito peppers (really good, but WAY too large of a portion - I hate wasting food and we only ate like 1/3 of these - only so many peppers you can eat!)
-Sweet corn tempura (delicious and light - though deep fried somehow - again, surprisingly large portion)
-Mushroom and tofu skewers (mushroom skewers were amazing and filling - the tofu skewers had this really great spice mix on them)
-Japanese Wild Mushroom Rice Hotpot (a little gooey for my taste, but the flavors were robust and spot on)
-Mushroom sliders (hearty, flavorful mushrooms, yum!)
-Flame Seared Sesame Salmon Nigiri - this was the highlight of the evening - this literally melted in my mouth and tasted so delicious, I almost forgot that I was eating sushi in Scottsdale

The service was really great - we sat at the bar, which was large and spacious. The tables actually wouldn't have accommodated all of the food we ordered.

I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Very interesting restaurant featuring sushi and steak, but well fused together. I really enjoyed corn, ribeye steak, complementary sushi from the chef, and fabulous mochi ice cream. I will definitely have dinner here when I return to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Although not a place I would go for my regular sushi jones, this is a great place for dates and other such special occasions. I made reservations and was called in advance to ask if I wanted anything special on the table or if I was \"celebrating anything special\". Upon arrival we were greeted by the seating hostess and taken to our table. 

The space is airy and trendy, someone described it as \"zen\" and I would agree. Very nice colors are used in the space.  Our server was a bit over-perky, but not over-bearing. His occasional attempts to get me to buy almost the most expensive thing on the menu was a bit annoying at times, but hey, dude's gotta sell. We decided on sushi, sake and tempura. All of our food was beautifully prepared and tasty, and my sake choice was delectable. Fish was fresh, did not have that \"previously frozen\" taste, and the rolls (Serrano Chili Hamachi Roll, Soft Shell Crab) were just excellent creations (albeit not your standard Japanese sushi roll). 

All the waitstaff were extremely attentive, ensuring that our water glasses and sake cups were never empty and that our table was not cluttered. When my date left for the bathroom, they even folded his napkin for him. 

Again, not a place I would go on a regular basis for sushi, but definitely a place for special occasions."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I had my concerns coming here. Considering the appearance of this place and other sushi experiences in the Phoenix area, I was worried it might be another poor representation of Japanese food for too much money. As you can tell by the rating, I was obviously surprised for the better. 

The atmosphere is very modern American. They have a happy hour, but it is only available at the bar. Nearly from the moment we sat down, the waitress was telling us about all the different specials they had and the greats lengths the chefs go through to bring us this fine food. It felt like she was reading a memorized essay to us. I almost felt sad for her. 

Their menu has a deceptively large food and price variety, ranging from $1.50 crispy BBQ rice (which I recommend) to $128 per person dinner. It is possible to get a good yet complete dinner here for less than $30 as we came close without even trying. We had their butterfish tataki, shishito peppers, and tomato salad for appetizer all of which were very good. Then we had their 5 sashami chef's selection. They gave us pretty standard fish (salmon, tuna, scallop, striped bass, yellowtail). According to the waitress, they fly in their fish fresh everyday from the source. Tasting the fish, I believe it as it was pretty good. We had their soft shell crab roll, which was the most disappointing dish we ordered. We also had the zucchini and rice hotpot, which tasted surprisingly authentic. Our most fancy dish was the wagyu beef, which was $10/oz.. They slow cook it for 3 days and they serve it with 3 seasonings such as hawaiian lava salt. With all this hype surrounding just beef, I had my hopes up. Sadly, it barely tasted better than most steaks I've had and was a far cry from the $160/lb price. 

I'm already thinking about the next time I'll be able to come back here. For me, Roka Akor is just a few good dishes away from being a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place to relax for a good happy hour. Haven't had a full dinner there yet."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently ate at this restaurant for a friends birthday.  I have to say the food was amazing!!!!  The service was great and the presentation was beautiful!  I highly recommend this place if you have not been there.  It is expensive, but worth it!!"}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum... and the saki ain't bad either. 

Took the Hubs here for a Bday celebration this week. We'd never been before, but it was on my \"to try\" list and there happen to be a groupon available that we just couldn't resist. Upon are arrival, I was happy to see the open modern decor. I really liked how the place was arranged with many different venues for sitting and dining. Our waiter was extremely nice and convinced up to try some cold saki for the first time, which we both enjoyed. We were able to make a great selection and thoroughly enjoyed it. 

As far as the food goes, of course I researched yelp and figured out what we would order before we even arrived. So, we got the beef and kimchi dumplings, the rock shrimp tempera, chicken teryaki, sweet corn, and grilled rice. OMG was everything great! Stand outs for me were the shrimp tempera (the lime added so much), the dumplings were great - meaty and filling, and the corn was beyond awesome. The grill rice was very unique and we loved it. 

We were surprised with a great peanut butter/chocolate dessert, which was \"close your eye and enjoy\" good. As far as bday dinners go, this one was on point. We loved the experience and the food and will most certainly go back for another special occasion."}
{"text":"We're just moving to the area and we got a gift certificate for Roka Akor from friends.  Excellent location, beautiful building and ambience. High-end dining with amazing service. We had cocktails, sashimi and sushi. Everything was fresh and the presentation was excellent.  Overall an excellent five-star dining experience fit for a rock star."}
{"text":"What can be wrong with a place that has hh all night every night?! I think it's just a summer special, but hey, I'll take it! On top of great food and drink specials I've always had excellent service there, which to me, is the perfect combo! 

The drink specials are ok. It's a few dollars off the normal priced drinks, so pretty normal for a happy hour. The food however, is awesome! For $3 the mini chibi burger is by far the best thing one the hh menu. The meet is rich, juicy, and flavorful. This is anything but your normal slider. Who would've thought you could get something so delicious at a restaurant that specializes in sushi! AMAZING. Try ordering one and I guarantee you'll get another :) Delicious!"}
{"text":"The Happy Hour menu is fabulous! Every time I go, I order from it. I would highly recommend the Tokyo Girl cocktail, the scallops and the sushi. But you really can't go wrong with any order. The only 'bad' thing is: the last two times I've gone, they have been out of black cod."}
{"text":"Very impress seeing all the team cooking and preparing sushi, it's an art. It's expensive but it's worth every penny, an amazing experience."}
{"text":"We were in town looking for a nice sushi place to eat and decided to give it a try. Interior is very nice and staff was friendly. Main reason for the 2 stars is that food was overpriced when compared to its quality and presentation. We tried a few rolls ( not very authentic) and the lamb chops. The lamb was again overpriced and it came with a cucumber salad on the side. The salad consisted of 4 three inch thin slices of cucumber stacked like a fort that you build when you are in middle school - terrible presentation. Give it a try and be your own judge but if you are looking for authentic sushi this is not your place."}
{"text":"When it comes to sushi, the old adage \"You get what you pay for\" is never more true. And what you get at Roka Akor is top quality sushi. Now, if you want to get MORE than what you pay for, I suggest dining in the lounge/bar area where they have happy hour all day/every day until September. We tried the Dynamite Scallop Roll and Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll, both on the happy hour menu. And both were good, though I preferred the Hamachi roll. And please, please, please don't just eat sushi rolls. If you're going to pay this much, you really should partake in some quality sashimi. We diverged from the happy hour menu in this area and opted for the young yellowtail and tuna belly, which were both top quality. Other notables were the Butterfish Tataki and Crispy Fried Squid.

Honorable mention definitely goes to the Crispy Fried Brussels Sprouts. I've never had better brussels sprouts. It's a generous portion and even Momofuku's roasted brussels sprouts can't even hold a candle to these. Delicious."}
{"text":"Happy hour review only:

Seriously, Roka Akor has the best happy hour! A ton of pretty food options, a few refreshing cocktails (albeit weak on the alcohol), and really trendy vibes. We got a ton of bites and drinks for very reasonable prices. Plenty of space for large groups too.

Standout dishes for me were the brussel sprouts, dumplings, soft shell crab slider, sweet corn tempura, and butterfish tataki. I think the sushi is just ok. Can't wait for the new location in SF!"}
{"text":"Wow. It was pleasantly surprising to find such a good Japanese restaurant in Scottsdale. I came here with my parents as I was in the area for the holidays.

Casey was our waiter and probably one of the best I've ever had. He has such intimate knowledge of the entire menu and how everything is prepared. Don't hesitate to ask him anything as he knows all the details and as eaten pretty much everything on the menu.

Everything we ordered below was really good. Many of them were signature dishes. Casey also had good recommendations.

Appetizers:
- Butterfish tataki
- Grilled pork belly (MUST MUST get this! mmmm :P)

Sushi:
- Sashimi sampler 5 (The kampachi was soooo good!)
- Hamachi and serrano chili maki

Grilled stewers: Both of these are a must
- Sweet potato
- Sweet corn

Entrees:
- Korean spiced lamb chops
- Yuzu miso black cod
- Rice and mushroom hotpot

Desserts: Both of these were excellent with really unique homemade ice cream
Mango and vanilla cake with toasted rice ice cream
Vanilla panna cotta with yuzu ice cream

Drinks:
2x large Asahi
Green tea

Come with lots of time and lots of money. Although they have many expensive/indulgent dishes, most are reasonably priced. Our dinner came out to about $70/person including tax/tip.

If you decide to go, request a table in Casey's area. I can't imagine anyone there knowing more than he does, except for probably the chefs or owner. Make a reservation as this place gets packed pretty quickly. I'll definitely have to go back next time I'm in Scottsdale. Fortunately, my parents have a condo a few miles away. :D"}
{"text":"OMG - delicious!! I brought my partner here for father's day and what a treat! Our waiter Eugene made everything sound tantalizing and amazing and it was even better than his description. 

We went early on a Monday evening about 5:30 pm and sat at the sushi bar the restaurant was mostly empty but got busier later. We paced ourselves and got something not on the menu the Maitake mushroom - slow roasted on their grill and it was heaven, you could tell the hint of charcoal they were using and it just gave it amazing flavor, Eugene recommended it and also got some edamame.

We also tried the dynamite roll and it was dynamite! It was like a mouthgasm. We also tried the tempura butter fish and prawns - amazing as well. The only thing we weren't crazy about was the tempura avocado, it was good it just wasn't as amazing as everything else. 

We would have done more but were full after that except for the white brownie dessert we had to save room for, that was simply divine as well.

5 stars all around for Eugene and for the amazing food and very cool atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Roka Akor is GREAT!

During the Summer they have all-night Happy Hour in the lounge, filled with tons of food and drink specials, so that is something you should definitely take advantage of.  Keep in mind that doesn't mean it's all cheap, though.  $3 off each glass of wine (which means about $8 per glass), and then appetizers for between $3 and $9 that aren't too filling, but are darn tasty.

Service is very good, and the decor is incredibly beautiful.  My favorite food items are the Black Cod and the Wagyu Sashimi.

When we went we were able to try a free White Chocolate Brownie dessert. So tasty.

It's all a little pricey, but I suppose you get what you pay for. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"One word:  Superb!  My bestie and I enjoyed the Decadent Omakase.  It is A LOT of food but well worth it.  Everything from sushi to kobe beef, seafood, and even bone marrow to spread on toast!  Everything was of the highest quality and delicious.  Service was excellent and attentive without overdoing it.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Roma Akor rocks the palette! You must try the Butterfish Tataki and the Peanut Butter ice cream! Get Ryan as your server.  He  is excellent. In addition this place KNOWS customer service . I have come here 3 times and the food is excellent every time."}
{"text":"London, Hong Kong, Scottsdale, people.  Yes, somehow our locale has scored enough to have this latest Roka outpost.  However, in case you didn't notice, Roka Akor is a palindrome.  Yes, I'm a word nerd.  But the food, service and atmosphere here are anything but nerdy.

I brought my friend and her vacationing Snowbird parents here and we had a great time.  The comped food and drink here ran the gamut, from delicious butterfishwhite asparagus sashimi to chicken skewers and pork and scallop dumplings, which were our favorite.  But seriously, of the five appetizer dishes and lychee martinis and French white wine nothing disappointed.  $370 for seven people was steep for my budget, but this is the sort of place my parents would like and would patronize.  I recommend it for that for sure.  

Loved the space, even the distinctive restrooms.  The highlight here was the large and airy looking floor-to-ceiling wine collection behind glass cases.

The service here was extremely professional and in case you didn't notice (according to my friend Maya) the women servers here all dress and serve in 4-inch heels.  Damn Gina."}
{"text":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!  I will admit the service and decor was great but everthing else was lacking.  FOOD IS OUTRAGEOUSLY PRICED for what you get.  We had a party of 4 and our bill before tip was $190...  I'd pay that kind of money again for a good steak dinner but not sushi.  Hope this helps...."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Roka Akor and went based on a friend's recommendation.  I was immediately taken aback as I had a different mental image, something more quaint and romantic but it is definitely to be seen and energetic.  The service overall is impeccable, however I feel our waiter was a bit short handed and it was long durations before he would come back and check on us.  Given that two people spent upwards of $150 on dinner, I would have liked more service and attention.  He seemed a bit bothered that we wanted to take our time and that we would be there for a bit longer.  Overall, the Saki/cocktail list is notable and quite intimidating, especially if you are not a saki aficionado. The food was great, fresh and great presentation.  We had the yellowtail sashimi to start, which was by far the best yellow tail ever.  We also had the Maine Lobster tempura, which was quite nice and presented with the lobster head, which was a bit macabre but I get it. A couple of rolls, nothing fancy and BAM more than $150, not including drinks.  Overall had a decent experience but not likely to be a regular due to lack of genuine service and overall money spent, very little ROI."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to 5 stars instead of the 3 I originally gave. Here's why: 

In my book, good customer service is, hands-down, the most important thing when running a great business. And this place has that.

After I wrote my 3 star rating for Roka Akor (not even a bad review, just average) I was contacted by the manager and he apologized for my experience not being up to par with what they expect. He offered to have me back in the restaurant to have dinner on them, but to be honest, the sentiment itself is enough for me! The fact that they care so much about their customers makes me want to eat there again, for full price!!!

Well done, Roka Akor. Your stellar customer service is what really makes me recommend that people check you out! And thanks to Angelo the manager for such a gracious offer."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for reminding me to write this review.  All I can say is OMG.  This was THE best food experience of my life. Since it was our anniversary we decided to throw caution to the wind and go with the chef's choice menu.  We told our amazing waitress that if the cost went up a bit so that the chef could deviate and give us some adventurous options, we would be up for that.  

Once we made that selection, the food NEVER stopped coming and each dish was better than the next!  Some stand out favorites were:  The tempura lobster tail medallions served beautifully in the lobster tail.  The Sushi bowl that came was amazingly beautiful and some of the best I've ever had.  

The vegetable dishes were wonderful, brussel sprouts, some sort of chile we've never had but now crave. 

The beer they import directly from Japan was fantastic!  

I really, really can't say enough about this meal and the service.  We sat outside but if you do the chefs meal, we would recommend sitting at the table that wraps around the kitchen."}
{"text":"I am not one to write reviews or to put any establishment on blast, having grown up and worked in the restaurant business I know how hard it is to maintain consistent high quality food and service. Staff turnover and other variables are the nature of this business. But my experience and visit to Roka Akor was like nothing else I have experienced recently to date. 
We sat at the sushi bar and ordered the Omakase, I know Omakase literally means \"I leave it up to the chef' but we did specify that we would like to have sushi, and mostly sashimi if possible and asked if any sauces with dairy and gluten could be left off. While I know this is annoying I also know it is not that hard especially at a sushi restaurant to do this, he waiter went and asked the chef and we heard and saw them both complaining about it and when the waiter said No, they could
Not fulfill that request we said it was ok that we would still continue with the tasting. When we asked if there was anything else besides sushi in the tasting the waiter assured us that  it would be all sushi with a little 'maybe a few pieces' he said of beef. We were fine with that since we do not eat meat regularly but we said that would be fine and didn't want to make any other demands or changes to the chefs flow.  
We ordered a bottle of water, I'll get back to the water later,  and watched as the chefs started to prepare our meal....
Right away I was turned off by the look of the fish as they removed it and unwrapped it in front of us... it did not look fresh or like it was good quality but we didn't say anything instead we watched as the sushi chef began cutting away skin and bad pieces of fish from the filet... and he wiped the sushi knife numerous times with a dirty dish towel OVER the fish. This immediately turned me off and raised a red flag but I did not complain and asked my boyfriend to not complain. It was so bad that we could not leave the bathroom the following day and ruined the rest of our time in the hotel. I will spare details because I barley write these things but when I tell you it was bad.... trust me I don't say many things are bad EVER and it was bad. Let's just say we made sure to tip the hotel staff generously and they asked where we got sick. We were staying at a very nice resort nearby the restaurant 
I can not believe that an establishment of this caliber would not be up to par with the quality of its food and its service it was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Tuesday at 5pm. Nobody greeted me at the door. I sat down and it took a few minutes for a waiter and he told me I had to sit at the bar. Next I ordered sushi California roll. I'm giving an extra star for the food cause it was just okay. Then when I was heading out nobody acknowledged me leaving either. That service was awful and based on that experience I do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this place.  I went and sat at the bar - and was not assisted until I asked THREE times if I could get a drink.  Finally I did get one - and the bartender was puzzled when I asked if they had sake.  I had to kind of explain what a sake bomber was.  I was bummed out when they told me that they don't carry the larger sized beer bottles.  They finally brought me a thing of sake that was not in the traditional sake bottle or glass.   A Japanese person would be very insulted by this.  As for the food - I am not sure because I didn't have any.  I might give this place a second chance but not very likely."}
{"text":"I finally sat at to the sushi bar!  I now know I never want a job cracking open oysters; that guy should get a bonus!  Also, Roka Akor knows how to make some beautiful dishes!  

 I should start off by saying Roka Akor has great food, BUT I am starting to come to the conclusion that I just need to come to Roka Akor for happy hour or the dinner entrees, not the sushi.  Their rolls (we had the Serrano Chili and Spicy Tuna) were honestly not that exciting and on the small side, but they tasted good and were solidly made.  I wish I had gone with my instincts and tried the Dynamite Scallop Roll, because we saw one being made later at the bar and it looked yummy.  The warm Wagyu roll sounded interesting to try next time too.  

I ALWAYS get the BUTTERFISH TATAKI; it is seriously amazing.  But, I should also say you get 5 small pieces of fish for $11, and it would never fill you up.  The octopus salad was delicious but came on a plate the size of a tea saucer with more greens than octopus (maybe 5 pieces of octopus); most octopus salad I have had, the majority of it is octopus.  As Jared R. said the Waygu Kimchi dumplings were not as exciting as all the other things we ate.  I think you just come to expect that WOW factor at Roka Akor and they don't deliver that.  

I checked in on Yelp and they offered the Yuzu Mousse dessert with a beverage purchase, which was a pleasant surprise!  The mousse was light and fluffy with the perfect amount of lemon; definitely not rich and over-baring.  It came with a raspberry drizzle that complemented it beautifully.  

Not to be cliche, but one thing that was kind of noticeable to my date and I, was out of the 8 people in the open kitchen, one was Japanese.  

As for our service this time it was okay.  The guy I went with had never been to Roka Akor and had quite a few questions because they have a unique menu that lacks descriptions, which is fine when you have a knowledgeable waiter- but we didn't. I almost wonder if our waiter was relatively new, because he did not describe things very well and most things were described with adjectives like 'good' or 'great' and he basically just said 'I think I would go with that.'  It really didn't give you much to go on, especially since the menu does not have descriptions.  But, he got the job done and he was fast and pleasant, so I am not really complaining.  

What to take home with you: Roka Akor has beautiful, yummy food.  The prices are high and I think you can get just as good, if not better, sushi other places. ORDER THE BUTTERFISH TATAKI. They also have one of the greatest happy hours in town, with outstanding, reasonable food options!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now - once to celebrate my SO's first residential purchase in the valley, once for a networking event, and most recently for their $1 oyster Thursdays. The first time was highly disappointing - I remember feeling robbed, and wishing we had gone to Roka Akor instead. Also, I did not appreciate one of the servers \"teaching\" us about why we shouldn't ask for soy sauce for sashimi we had ordered. Maybe the chef had advised the waitstaff to share that it had already been lightly brushed or whatever, but the message was lost in her air of pretension/didactic delivery. The networking event was...like any other networking event. My most recent visit, however, was amazing. We sat at the bar, and thoroughly enjoyed everything, especially the Kusshi oysters. I had qualms about eating oysters during a non \"R\" month, but they were plenty fresh. We spent a little more than we had anticipated despite the HH menu being priced very modestly (close to $100 for 2, I think?), but we'll definitely be going back for the HH. It will probably take a while before we go back for a full dining experience again, though. Oh, and the bartender was awesome. He managed his bar like nobody's business, even when it was clearly slammed. As someone who's worked at a high-end restaurant before, I was thoroughly impressed. Kudos."}
{"text":"I was here for the Yelp event and from what I saw and sampled I liked.  The apps we ordered were good, except for the calamari which had way too much ginger.  There should have been a sauce to cut it with.   We only sampled a small part of the sushi but it was well done and I would like to try more.  The mixed drinks were great.

The space is light and airy, just like the best Japanese places I've dined at (Morimoto, Nobu....however, the cusisine, while good, is not at that level). The larger menu seems inviting and our service was fantastic.  Looking at the menu, prices aren't that far off from various Japanese places of that scope (not necessarily in the Phoenix area), and perhaps even cheaper.

Its not like other Japanese places in the Valley. Its not your average sushi place.

Oh, and the complimentary valet was a nice and unexpected touch."}
{"text":"Creative Japanese dishes with plenty of depth in their flavors. Atmosphere is more like a modern high end dining experience. The waiters, staff run this joint like a smooth sailing ship. Very impressed. 
The maki rolls, fried tofu and steak we're excellent."}
{"text":"Last night my husband took me to dinner.We read the reviews so we do what to expect .It was even better  .the fun part was a table next to us was Doctors enjoying a wonderful dinner with friends .They were very loud but 2 of them apologized  but we told them we enjoyed the laughter the waiter new we did he saw me get in there pic lol"}
{"text":"First, let me start off by saying that I used to have a love affair with Roka.  The Omakase was the multi-course sumptuous dining experience I selected every time I visited.  They had a $99 option and a $128 one and both were an exotic extravaganza of delectable delights (the $128 Omakase promised extra exotic, pricier ingredients).

The Omakase is an improvisational dining experience with consideration given to the diner's food preferences and allergies.  When I used to order the Omakase, I always left dazzled by the presentation, colors, textures, and flavors of the dishes I received.  Every dish was superb and left you anticipating your next experience.

Sadly, the Omakase is now a shadow of its former self, sorely lacking across every culinary dimension and I have twice walked away feeling disappointed and ripped off.  In the past year, they have eliminated the $99 option, but kept the $128 one.  No matter, as long as the dishes maintain the same quality and consistency.  When I order the Omakase, I expect to receive exciting and surprising dishes that highlight the chef's creativity and artistry.   What I don't expect to receive are generic dishes that can be ordered off the menu a la carte for a fraction of the hefty $128 price tag.

Here are the 6 courses I received at my last $128 experience (with accompanying a la carte prices): Shishito Peppers with Ponzu and Bonito - $7, a SINGLE scallop with curry sauce (since ONE scallop is not an a la carte menu item, I am going to be be generous and use the pricing for the Robata Grilled Scallops with Yuzu Shiso) - $15, Assorted Steamed Shellfish with Tomato Miso - $23, Wagyu Beef Tataki - $18, Crispy Brussels Sprouts  - $7, and a lackluster presentation of dessert which consisted of one scoop of ice cream - $4 and Cassis, Pear, & Blood Orange Mousse - $12 ( the dessert was also accompanied by a razor thin slice of pear, one slice of mango, and two slices of kiwi).  Had each of items been ordered a la carte, the sum total would have been $86, a $42 savings on the $128 Omakase price tag.  

Again, not only were the dishes not in keeping with the grand billing that Roka gives the Omakase: \"Roka Akor's Tour De Force, Featuring Our Signature Dishes and Inspired Creations\" (not really sure where the 'inspired creations' part comes in since they are all a la carte dishes), the presentations have gone downhill too.  Desserts used to be magnificently presented on multi-platform dishes with tons of decorative fruits, flowers, and greenery.  Now they come on simple, small white plates.  This 'Tour de Force' is now nothing but a Tour de Flop and a colossal rip-off. As such, I can no longer recommend this place, nor will I be returning.  The love affair is definitely over."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this is the best sushi I have had in a while! 

First of all, a really nice ambiance that is modern and sleek but with some dimmer lighting to make it feel a little more warm and inviting. There is room on the patio too, by the fire pits, but it was a little too hot last night - maybe in the fall!  Our waitstaff were really sweet and courteous, and the place has an open kitchen so you can see (and smell ! ) all the amazingness that is being prepared.

Everything we ordered was delicious! The lamb dish with korean spices was perfectly cooked (we asked for it to be medium, instead of medium rare, which I think was a good move), and the sides were amazing - especially the sweet potato and the brussel sprouts. 

And the sushi - they make even the classics absolutely mouthwatering, from salmon-avocado to crispy prawns to the california roll. The quality of the fish was excellent, and I think next time I'll probably order some sashimi too. 

We weren't even that hungry, but we finished everything it was so good! 
Definitely recommend this place! I'm going to have to come back for the happy hour!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary at Roka.  It's one of my favorite spots in the east valley.  It was a beautiful night and we dined outside on the patio. Some light noise from Scottsdale road, but still very pleasurable.  The waiter was awesome.  He helped us decide on a wine that accommodated both our pallets without breaking the bank.  Even though we have enjoyed the bulk of the menu during past dinning experiences, the waiter still went over a few features and specials.  He made some recommendations and one was the Octopus.  Octopus is a difficult dish to prepare and often becomes very tough and chewing, but we went with it anyway.  Unfortunately we were disappointed.  We told the waiter and he immediately told the chef and took it off our bill.  He also brought us a complimentary salmon dish that he had also recommended.  It was amazing.  We are foodies and we expect great service as part of the dinning experience.  Roka Nailed It !!!!!!    they also have a great Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Love this place! The giant shrimp is sooo good!! I have a new addiction:) Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. It's a bit expensive but worth it!"}
{"text":"A little pricy but amazing service!!! I always get sushi rolls! Favorite drink is the wait list... if you like citrus you'll like this too!"}
{"text":"Apparently they remodeled the outdoor seating, so now they have a super cool heat lamp that is adjustable, the waiter gave us a little fire show...I have to admit it was nothing short of amazing. 

The food was super yum, we ordered the Kobe Beef and Kimchi dumplings which I recommend. So juicy and the flavor is really good! The creminie mushrooms with garlic and butter was as mouth-watering as it sounds. We ordered the Yuzu miso black cod for the main dish which was cooked to perfection and very well presented in a banana leaf! We also ordered a roll, I forget which one. But not important because everyone should try the cod!

This is a perfect place for a nice date/anniversary celebration! Very romantic, the food is great, but hopefully you're sig other will pay because it gets pretty pricey! The service was really good, they refilled our drinks and waters pretty often and helped us make our choices. I ordered a fruit infused green tea which came with some syrupy sweetener, but I think it needed to be sweetened even more. 

I didn't get to try the desert, but I think happy hour would be a great time to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Roka never fails to deliver great food.  The Scottsdale location is more low key in decor than others I've been to, but the food was just as fantastic.  Ambient sound tended to get quite loud during busy times - to the point you could barely hear others at your table.  They brought a complimentary dessert for our friend's graduation celebration - so few places will do something gratis like this as a surprise!"}
{"text":"Exceptional! Our experience every time is great. Collin, the bartender, goes above and beyond! He makes great recommendations (based on your preferences; doesn't just push high priced items), great bar tender and pleased with the food! The kimchi is superb and the tataki with white asparagus is one of the best dishes!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the scallop sushi.  Didn't try much of their robata, but grilled scallops were awesome too (yeah, so I'm not that creative. Sorry).  

I ordered way too much fried food... shouldn't have gone for the fried oysters & and the veggie/seafood tempura.  I wasn't a huge fan of all of the batter.  I expected a much lighter coating.  (I know, waah.)

Overall, a nice experience.  I really wasn't expecting such awesomely fresh scallops in the middle of the desert!  I came here on a weeknight, and heard about their all-you-can-eat sushi brunch.  Good thing I'm not staying through the weekend, otherwise I'd bankrupt 'em in no time..."}
{"text":"I love everything about Roka Akor! The food and ambiance as well as service is second to none.  Pricing is very affordable too.

Whether you're looking for the ideal place for tapas and happy hour or dinner or brunch, you'll love it too! and do try their specialty mango tea - it's divine.

Also great space for parties and events.

ALL IS A MUST!"}
{"text":"We went to Roka for the first time for our 10th anniversary. When we arrived, they had our table ready for us with a rose for my wife. Everyone knew why we were there and we felt most welcome!
The food and drink was phenomenal. They have an excellent selection of both. We ordered some small plates and then topped it off with their Deluxe Platter: a wonderful presentation of some excellent seafood. Well worth it!
To cap off the night, the chef prepared the single most amazing dessert we've ever had. Various ice creams, exotic fruits, strawberries meticulously crafted into roses, and an assortment of macaroons. 
We left knowing we'd be back and our only regret was not going there sooner!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was pleasant and very knowledgeable. Was a little pricey as are most places in Scottsdale. Must try the Butterfish Tataki with White Asparagus and Yuz, both my date and I raved about it. The BBQ pork loin was also very tasty. I would skip the rice pot, the flavor was very muddled. We also tried the Serrano Chili roll, which as would be imagined was pretty spicy. My only complaint is the chairs, terribly uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Fantastic sashimi and sushi.  Really good drinks.  Attentive service.  We go out of way to come here when we are in town.  

One note: Very reasonably priced bar menu but the servings are very small.  Go ahead and order what you actually want, because the dishes on the regular menu are much larger."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Scottsdale....period.
You just can't go wrong, everything is absolutely amazing!
Dumplings, Shishito pepperes, squid, tuna roll....all fabulous. Their desserts are tasty as well.
We will be back at least once a month!!"}
{"text":"I am at Roka writing this review. Upon entering this restaurant, we were impressed by the decor, music, and door handles. We were on time (even a little early) and notified that they could seat us after a 30 minute wait. We took their offer to sit outside (February) with only a 5 minute wait. Once seated, we were brought empty water glasses, and waited 15 minutes for a server to bring menus. Food review to come shortly."}
{"text":"Good but a bit pricey.

The bartender was fabulous as we didn't even look at the drink menu.  He just asked us what we liked and then he gave us drinks and they were all good, especially the pineapple infused sochshu.  That is a good bartender.  he is also recommended food.

we had the butterfish wrapped white asparagus with a citrus glazed, semi raw - it was tender and delicious.  We also had their signature dish of serrano chili topped hamachi sushi - which was tasty.  We had to have sweet potato tempura which was served with a green tea sea salt - yummy."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent! Grilled lamb chops and veggies were out of this world!
Service was good. Prices are VERY high. Either pay them, or go for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Everything we got was amazing. The butterfish takaki was my favorite! The two steaks we got were delicious as well. I felt like the steaks melt in your mouth! 

It was mine and my nieces bday, we thought they would sing happy birthday to us but they just brought out their birthday dessert dish with the candle lit and left. So don't expect them to sing to you if you are

Besides that, I'd probably come back here when I'm in Arizona again"}
{"text":"Went in last night and had a wonderful experience. Wesley was our server and the food and service was exceptional. Butterfish Tataki is to die for! We also had the black cod and the Bronzino. Sashimi was extremely fresh and so were the oysters. Seriously a culinary experience of delight!"}

{"text":"Me and my fiance went here on a recommendation for our anniversary and so happy we did. Don't get me wrong it's pricey but the food and service is AMAZING! As soon as we got there we were seated and the manager came over to congratulate us and that our dessert would be free. We like to share so we ordered the Oysters,  the duck, the bone barrow, a couple of drinks and maybe one other things and then the dessert platter came. Holy crap it was huge with a little of of all their desserts! Everything was incredibly excellent, except the almost $200 bill but hey I guess you get what u pay for !"}
{"text":"Upon arriving (10 minutes early) we were seated immediately. The restaurant is very open and more modern than any restaurant I recall being in. 

They were quite confused at shift change about who would serve us but once that got straightened out, the service was exemplary. 

Having the edamame and butterfish appetizers were great for a beginner course. This was followed up by a salmon avocado roll and hamachi, kampachi sashimi and suzuki sushi which was some of the best I've had. This matched with the homemade wasabi...set the bar. 

My only complaint is the pricing. I've sushi that was just as good for half the price I paid for last night.  But they seem to be doing well. I probably wont return but I certainly wouldn't steer people away either."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome staff. Sushi was very fresh and had a wonderful presentation. Prices are a bit on the high side, I would highly recommend it for a date night or special occasion."}
{"text":"romantic- great service. 

would be awesome to go with a group and do the chef selection option (although a bit pricey)"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely terrible!  Everything that could have gone wrong did!  I would absolutely not recommend this place not will we ever return.  They messed up our entire order, service was incredibly slow and forgetful, and the some of the fish was very fishy tasting.  It is outrageously expensive which we knew going in, but expected Nobu quality.  What we got was one of the worst dining experience we have ever had.  There are so many incredible place to go in Scottsdale... do yourself a favor and skip this one!"}
{"text":"NJBeen here three times ....the first time was on valentine's day and they had a special coursed meal.  I thought the food was delicious and would definitely come back.  I visited roka a second time and my girlfriend and I ordered for ourselves but found that the food lacked the magic from the first time.  Finally we went a third time and while it was good, we just didn't find it was worth the price. 

some things we had tried..

butterfish tataki - definitely a good appetizer highly recommended 

prime flight - pricey item, good but not worth the price 

sushi- once again good but not anything out of this world

don't get me wrong it's a good place to eat but when you factor in the price there are better options"}
{"text":"One of Scottsdale's treasures!  I had never been to a place like Roka Akor, where the steak comes so highly recommended as does the sushi.  

First things first: complimentary valet. 

Second: we came at 9 pm on a Saturday evening, and was easily able to make a reservation an hour before we wanted to get there.  There were a couple empty times, but generally, the vibe was very positive, happy, and upbeat! 

Third: when ordering, keep in mind that the food can be shared amongst multiple people.

For a group of three, we ordered:

- the butterfish tataki, since we saw so many great reviews on Yelp;
- the beef tataki, because it was highly recommended by the waiter;
- the premium blue fin tuna flight;
- two orders of the 5-piece nigiri; 
- the hamachi serrano roll; and
- the new york strip with some sort of aioli on the side.

All the food was AMAZING, but the beef tataki and the premium blue fin tuna flight were the highlights of the evening.  The beef tataki comes with shiso peppers that are chopped up and cooked with wagyu fat, and that wagyu fat -- so. freaking. good.

The premium blue fin tuna flight comes out with 12 pieces, 3 pieces each of four different parts of the tuna.  Roka Akor has freshly ground wasabi for the two less fatty types and Himalayan salt to be used for the fatty-er types.  No need for soy sauce for something as rich as this premium tuna!  YUMMMM.

Cannot wait to be back!"}
{"text":"I FINALLY was able to visit Roka Akor for the AZ Power Networking lunch.  What a terrific event.  The atmosphere was gorgeous, and the staff was very accommodating.  I have to say that I do not know my sushi.  Normally, I would not eat a dish without knowing its ingredients, but I was very happy with the samplings provided.  And a coupon for a free appetizer to boot!"}
{"text":"Average food quality with above average prices. I had the lamb chops which were good but rather small and too much fat for my liking. For $28 I expected more. Not to mention my side of potatoes were another $4.50. The atmosphere was pleasant and the parking was ample, but I left feeling hungry and my wallet too much lighter considering the overall experience."}
{"text":"As far as sushi in Scottsdale goes, this place is Top Notch. I've been here several times, and the price tag is well worth the quality and service that is delivered. 

Most times I've ordered sashimi, a mix of yellowtail, salmon, tuna, and octopus.  OMG I literally can drool just thinking about it.  I swear the fish and preparation is almost like candy.  I've never ordered anything other than the seafood options. Literally, this is the best and freshest you can expect, you won't even know you're in arizona ;) 

Cocktails are on point.  Whether a simple martini or one of thier signature drinks, you'll be in good hands with the care and craft that the bartenders at Roka Akor take in preparing your drink.  

Room for improvement -- I wish wish wish wish there was outdoor seating for this place.  For beautiful scottsdale, it is sad to go from the sunshine outside into the darkness of its happy hour.  Once you walk inside, it immediately feels like night-time.  
I also think their happy hour menu is misleading. Don't fall for it, the prices look good but only because the portions are miniscule. If you are going to Roka Akor, expect to drop some change, and don't try to navigate through a less expensive happy hour menu, as you'll only be ordering more in quantity and spending the same amount.  Order what you want to eat and you'll be much more satisfied regardless of what your tab ends up being.  

Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I went there for their new brunch  service.   It was fantastic.  Really genuine and unique dishes and of course the service was fantastic as well.  It truly is a great brunch!"}
{"text":"I went to Roka Akor last night for a belated birthday celebration (mine) with my bosses. It was during Yelp Eats Week which meant when we arrived with no reservation we were told our only option was to eat at the sushi bar. Fine with me! 

The first thing we all noticed was that we had no server established until about an hour into our meal. Four people randomly attended to us until our appetizers showed up and then Charles came over and said he would be our server.  Also, two of us had arrived first, and one of the first people to approach us was a woman with two towels to wash our hands. Except they weren't warm. I have never ever had a cold wet towel handed to me in a Japanese restaurant, and Kat said every other time she's been here they've been warm. When Kate arrived a few minutes later, no one offered her a towel at all. Rad. 

We waited for about 15 minutes before anyone asked us about drinks, and then we didn't know who to grab to ask about appetizers. We did finally get the opportunity to order the butterfish appetizer, and when Kate asked for the seafood and vegetable tempura, she specifically asked if only one shrimp came with the order could they please add 2 more. The server seemed very confused and said he would have to ask the chef. Come on this isn't brain surgery people, add 2 shrimp, jesus.  

One of my bosses ordered a beef dish for her main course which she enjoyed except that they left significant chunks of gristle on the meat. The other ordered the miso cod which was completely perfect and something I would specifically seek out if and when I return to Roka. I ordered the 3 sashimi chef's selection and for $17 dollars I was presented with a huge bowl of ice and approximately one ounce of fish, 2 slices of scallop, 2 slices of the 'cheap' tuna, and 2 slices of salmon. The scallop was fine, the tuna was a bit spongy but the salmon was gorgeous.  Kate had also ordered a mushroom rice pot which didn't make it to our table for an additional 25 minutes. And for some reason, they didn't leave the pot at the table for us, which Kate said they normally do, as the pot serves 6 to 8 people, and we'd only had one small plate of it each. I was in the restroom for the delivery and plating of the rice so I didn't even see the size of it.  But I think it's extremely rude to pull a half-full dish without asking. 

Charles brought me a scoop of strawberry passionfruit sorbet with a candle in it which was very thoughtful but I wasn't wild about it and ordered the orange flourless cake with rose petal cream and raspberries for dessert. That was very good, probably the highlight of the evening.  Kate had ordered a nectarine shochu ($14) that arrived in a 6oz tumbler with a 4oz rock of ice in it and only 2 ounces of actual shochu. She was extremely disappointed with the shochu flavor which was not nectarine at all, more of a grapefruit gasoline. We called Charles back and showed him the ice to shochu ratio discrepancy and he kindly removed it from the table and our bill. 

Both bosses have been to Roka a number of times and said this was not a typical experience for the restaurant. And this was a Wednesday! That makes me believe Roka think it's cool to offer up sub-par service during promotional menus, even to those not interested in the promo. I would go back for the butterfish and the cod if someone insisted, but I can get a better quality and value for sushi at Yen over on 43rd Ave.  The evening was at least saved with great company and conversation."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Beautiful quality, great presentation, excellent service. Their sushi platters -OUT.OF.THIS.WORLD."}
{"text":"My husband, college age son, his girlfriend and I visited last night. We all agreed the experience and food was stellar. Unfortunately, it got off to a rough start which probably affected my opinion for awhile. We had reservations for 7:15 and arrived at 6:30 to wait for 1 person. Since it was happy hour until 7 in the bar, we thought we would have a drink while we waited. The bar was packed with several tables \"reserved\". When I explained this to the hostesses, they had a LOT of attitude telling us that all those tables were reserved. I pushed back a bit explaining that we would only be 1/2 hour or so as we had dinner reservations. They finally agreed to let us sit at a reserved table for 20 minutes to order a drink. I found the front desk people to be Snooty and arrogant. The vibe of the place seemed very \"hip\" but a little stuffy. Luckily, the waiter, servers and food made up for this. It is not a cheap place. We spent over $350 and didn't buy a lot. I always get offended when people who have reservations at the restaurant are treated worse than all the people crowding the bar to eat/drink cheap. Some consideration should be given to those who are going to be staying awhile and spending more. At the very least they should not have been treated rudely. My family all loved it this place.  I probably would not return though. Too many other places nearby where I may get be treated with more respect."}
{"text":"Just had first dinner with friends at Roka Akor. What  an outstanding array of food. Wow!  Roasted vegetable dumplings, pork belly with golden beets, grilled scallops, glazed pork ribs, mushrooms sautéed in soy garlic butter, etc., etc.  Flavors were fantastic, layered, yet not overwhelming.  Desserts platter (one of everything), was also excellent..  Warm chocolate toffee cake with peanut butter ice cream, sorbets, we loved it all.  Not inexpensive, but well  worth the splurge.  Service was also very good, very professional.  We will go again for our next special occasion."}
{"text":"Well fuck my ozone! What a wonderful dining experience! 

Started out with the Kobe and kimchi dumplings, which tasted like they didn't have any kimchi in it at all but still tasty, the INSANE pork belly! it'll make you slap yo' mama! and the yellowtail sashimi, which will make you slap yo' mama one mo' 'gin!

On the recommendation of the waitress, tried the O toro (which I've never heard of before) and it was thee best tasting, and most succulent piece of fish I have ever ever ever eaten! It was also accompanied by fresh wasabi, also, which I've never had, and I have to tell you it's so much better than whatever other wasabi you've ever tried. Ordered a second serving but was taken aback by the $50 per serving price tag when perusing the bill.  Still, well worth it! 

Yuzu marinated black cod is also an OMG, for serious! Tasty, light and flakey, and just perfect!

I highly recommend this palendrome of perfection."}
{"text":"For the price, it was ok.  The salmon nigiri was really great.  Everything else including the service was nothing spectacular.  Have had better in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best food that we have ever had. Our compliments to the chef and his team! Everyone was so knowledgeable about each dish. From the excellent service to the melt in your mouth steak, pork belly, cod, nigiri, and veggies we had a dining experience! I highly recommend to anyone that enjoys food."}
{"text":"We went here because it was voted one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale.
The sashimi is fresh and very tasty. 
The Butterfish is supposed to be the best item on the menu. B-friend loved it but one piece was enough for me. Mike LOVES spicy food but I am a whimp so did not try the two spicy skewers which he commented were not spicy... of course. The oysters were not as good as what we are used to in the bay area. 
It was okay but not worth the price of the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for cocktails and appetizers. The restaurant was packed. Lee was our bartender and she gave us a stellar experience. Overall, excellent food and beverage recommendations. Remarkably timely service. Love this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are fairly recent transplants to the Valley and I'd been given a recommendation to check this place out for sushi.  I'll start out by saying that the service was good and the sashimi that we order was fresh.  After that it pretty much goes down hill.  We spent $80 just on sushi, and both of us left there hungry.  Steep prices are met by skimpy amounts of fish.  The only normal sized item we were served was the salmon sashimi.  One of our appetizers was yellowtail, and for $18 we were served 6 tiny slivers of tuna.  The rolls, while I particularly enjoyed that they were the perfect bite sized amounts and looked pretty when it was served, primarily consisted of rice.  Sorry, but a mouthful of rice is not what I'm looking for when spending $15+ on a roll.  I'd actually like to have SOME fish in the roll.  Everything but the sashimi pretty much lacked flavor and character.  They touted when we got there that it was authentic Japanese, well, I hate to tell them it is far from it!  Just because you have a very limited selection on your menu doesn't mean it is authentic Japanese.  I've had sushi in Japan... and the Japanese would scoff at what was presented to us.  

If you want to pay for a \"yuppy\" Scottsdale vibe, then this is your place.  But if you actually want fish with your sushi and to be fulfilled when you're done eating... I'd keep looking because Roka Akor doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service was really nice. Wait staff was very attentive. The food on the other hand was not. I would never order sushi here. The dynamite roll that was suggested by the waiter was so fishy even soy sauce and spicy mayo couldn't cover it up. I almost spit it out into my napkin. The manager saw and came over to offer me something else that was really nice. The second roll I received was below average and very salty so I didn't eat it. The waiter came over at the end and brought me some small bites that were really good. Everything was just so salty and that's a lot bc I love salt. I had bites of steak, poke, shishito peppers and rolls but everything was below average. I would give this place a 4 just on the service and atmosphere alone but the food did not match the amount of money we spent. 2 of us spent $200 and I left disappointed and hungry. I would definitely have drinks here but not sure I would ever eat dinner here again."}
{"text":"We finally stopped in for happy hour and we sat at the bar (because all the decent bar tables were \"reserved\").
The prices are high, even for happy hour but the food is pretty good. 
The best things we ordered (we got 2) was the Roast Duck & Kimchi Udon ($9 on HH and $11 regular). That dish rocks... I wish they sold a meal portion.
The Beef Yakiniku Skewer with Sweet Garlic Glaze is ok but nothing special.
The Flame Seared Sesame Salmon Nigiri (4pc) was not the best I have had but good. 
Scallop and Seafood Ceviche Taco was really Delicious and although only $2, it is the smallest taco I have ever seen in my life.
The drinks are good, their martinis are tasty and they will muddle any fresh fruit or herb in it for you. 
The atmosphere is beautiful and the bartenders and servers are really nice. 
I will go back for happy hour- this would be a fun place to meet friends."}
{"text":"After only coming in for the great happy hour, I finally decided to sit down for dinner.  I always get the kobe sliders and the tempura corn, but our server suggested a few other great items.  The butterfish tataki and the black cod were absolutely amazing.

Don't forget to try the honey shochu."}
{"text":"We went to Roka Akor and sat at the bar to enjoy a glass of wine. We asked the bartender what she thought about the Omakase and she enthusiastically told us it was why she worked there. We decided to go for it and sat at the sushi bar. We also indulged in the wine pairings. It was one of the best meals I have ever had. The food was unbelievable and the service was flawless. They didn't make assumptions and asked if the price of the last glass of wine was agreeable before bringing it to us. It was not an inexpensive dinner (about $400) but we thought it was well worth it.The sushi was fresh, beautifully displayed, and delicious. The Wagyu beef was beyond comparison, and everything in between was a delight. 

We went back for happy hour the next evening and once again indulged in the chefs-choice sashimi and two other appetizers that were also wonderful. 

We live in Tucson but we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"In town visiting from LA and I have to say this was some the best food I have ever had.  I went with my sister who lives here and loves to go and Im now a fan as well.   The halibut was perfectly prepared...sweet and flaky w a nice grilled taste.  our sushi was all insane--yellowtail was my favorite..so buttery and melted in your mouth.  If you like tuna..the toro is well worth the price as well.

Service was great...and the best touch was the General Manager stopped to say hi and see how everything was, but then also made conversation with us...not just a hello and go.  It was very personable.

Overall...great time...look forward to coming here again next time Im in town and hope they open one in LA"}
{"text":"Simply amazing food.  Try the Wagyu (sp?) flight -- it is pricey but you will not be disappointed -- best steak in history."}
{"text":"Great impression when you walk in the door.  Not many restaurants look like Roka.  

Very unique and tasty dishes, and some of the best seafood in AZ.  Go on an empty stomach and share lots of dishes with friends.  A little spendy but definitely one of those great meals.  Great bar scene, fun people wtaching, and a good buzz in the restaurant.

Only reason I gave 4 vs 5 stars with the price...a meal for two is likely going to be $100 with a drink each.  Yet my wife and I still find ourselves back here often!"}
{"text":"$170 dinner for two, before tip. 

Happy hour is only in the lounge.  Make reservations for the dining room.  We sat in the patio.  There is nothing to enjoy about the patio other than the weather.  

Kumomoto oysters - A+! beautifully plated over ice with decorative seashells.  Flavored with a lovely fresh citrusy sauce. 
Butterfish sashimi - Very good. Not as amazing as everyone makes this out to be.  The fish has a good firmness. 
Yellowtail sashimi - thick sliced and very firm
Salmon sashimi - very nice
Sashimi is served with Fresh wasabi!!! It's the best, the quick heat disappears after you've swallowed it.  No horseradish here. 
Petit filet - sliced small and cooked perfectly. I didn't bother with the sauce on the side. 
Bone marrow - HUGE!  very yummy.  Could be overwhelming for some people and would be better shared with a group.   Tasted great when topped on the steak.  
White chocolate brownie - yelp coupon. Topped with ice cream.  I wouldn't order this if it didn't come free.   Not bad but I'm sure there's a better dessert. 

Our butterfish never came.  So before ordering dessert I finally reminded our server.  They brought it out with an excuse that the ticket was lost. We were charged for it. 

The food is great!  I would have liked to check out the happy hour."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and sake. The filet is about the best in town. The cod and salmon grilled dishes are above average but not great. The price point is a bit high, but if money isn't an issue, this place is always consistent and very good with excellent quality."}
{"text":"Party of 7 during Restaurant Week. We were very excited to try Roka and had experienced sushi fans as well as confirmed meat eaters with us. The restaurant is modern, sleek, lovely but the dining room is VERY loud. Our waiter, Evan, seemed less than thrilled to be working that night. Sullen, slow, distracted, on the verge of rude for most of the evening. Example- my husband asks some questions about the Japanese beer offerings and Evan's response was, \"it's just like Budweiser and Coors. Depends on what you like.\" Unhelpful comment. And I'm certain his manager doesn't appreciate his insulting their pricy imported beers by comparing them to ordinary domestics. 

Another waiter joined us later. Lisa was smiling, helpful and responsive. 

Service was very slow. Not \"well-paced slow,\" just poorly timed slow. 2 entrees came out without utensils (lamb chop, steak) and it was a full 7 minutes before 3 more entrees came. Still no utensils. Then the final 2 entrees and utensils, finally. 

On the bright side, the food - delicious! We loved the hamachi. I had the beef and kimchi dumplings and they were tasty. Entrees included black cod, lamb chops with Korean spices, grilled salmon and flank steak with chimichurri. Some items from the restaurant week menu and some off the regular menu. Most portions are on the small side although the lamb chops were served with 3 large chops. 

This is an expensive restaurant. You're paying for reputation, the experience, something different. I'm glad I visited but not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"Outstanding dining experience!!!

Annual meal, that I look forward to each year.  I go with a group which is hosted by a generous friend, who literally insists on getting one of everything.    All of it is good!!!

However, the item which stands out most in the experience was something only available at the bar......a Slider

Slider.....doesn't sound exotic compared to everything else on the menu, but damn!  It was good and it seems to me to be the best value on the menu too.  2 or 3 and you are full.

A little pricey, but great ambiance and music and service!"}
{"text":"I loved Roka Akor.  The food was great, but the bill was pricey.  This is an excellent place to go and have a feast of great dishes.  The black cod is great.  The madagascar shrimp are the second biggest shrimp I have ever seen.  The sushi is top notch as is the wasabi that comes with it.  The unusual thing about this place is that they carve the ice, cube by cube, out of a big block of ice for all their special drinks. 

It's tough to decide whether the food is worth the cost.  The service wasn't stand out and I've been their a few times.  All in all, I will be back..."}
{"text":"The place was pretentious as hell. Waitress took forever to get us water and ask for drinks. I got a shiso lime shochu. That was bad, really bad. The pineapple shochu was OK. Got a few rolls, nothing special. Didn't try any of the more signature dishes or a \"tasting\", but overall I'd say over-hyped."}
{"text":"Great place, great ambient atmosphere, great food. 

Have only had one dining experience here in addition to the numerous visits to the lounge. 

During the dining experience I sampled so much from the menu I do not remember anymore, but all the food was great. I ordered the salmon as my meal, tender and well seasoned portion. It was not too small or big, was the perfect portion. 


However whenever I come to the lounge, I ALWAY get this item....
the Chibi burger. I fell in love with it last year in April and been going since. Its a small burger, but very very flavorful. It is worth the price. 

I also enjoy the chili-lime Squid and salmon rolls. The chili-lime squid is different, fried squid mixed with thinly sliced jalapeños and a lime to squeeze. I love this item as well. The salmon rolls are fresh, the only salmon rolls that I know of that are this fresh. 

As for drinks, I love the Apple Mojito (virgin). Slightly sweet, but very refreshing. 
I have also tried the house Honey Sochu, very good and strong. Comes in a glass with ice just chipped off the block, literally. 


This is my favorite place for a late night quick bite. Great decently priced food in the lounge in a pricey restaurant."}
{"text":"Sushi is good.. I recommend the Taro .. But service is iffy and takes longer than usual... And for the price it's just not worth it for the quality they give. The atmosphere and venue is quite nice though."}
{"text":"For our sushi fix this week, we decided we wanted to try a place I had heard a lot of good things about, and we were willing to drop some coin, so we paid a visit to Roka Akor.  It was difficult to decide what we wanted, so we went ahead and sprung for the Omakase dinner.  We figured this would give us a pretty good idea what Roka is all about.

The appetizers came out first, one at a time.  The couple were butterfish and (I believe) tuna tataki.  The butterfish was the better of the two; the flavors were perfectly balanced.  It started out well.

We then had kumamoto oysters, one with ponzu sauce, and one with balsamic vinegar and caviar.  The balsamic oysters were off the hook; the waiter mentioned that this was a new invention by the chef.

Shortly thereafter, we were treated to some Japanese chili peppers, grilled and topped with freeze-dried mackerel flakes.  These were delicious.  The final appetizer was another new dish: seared big-eye tuna with asparagus in the middle, served on a cucumber and asparagus sauce.

We were then served the sashimi platter, which included six cuts of delicious fish (including sea bass, o toro, and a few other things I don't recall), and the most delicious, black truffle oil-coasted king crab I have ever tasted.  This was excellent sashimi, and where I felt the restaurant excelled.

We were served a miso soup with full shrimp, squid, scallops, mussels, and some mushrooms; this was another highlight for me.

For the entrees, we had the black cod, brussels sprouts, New York strip, and mushroom hot pot.  The cod was the most delicious cooked fish I have had, even exceeding last week's hamache collar.  They marinate the fish for 72 hours before slow cooking it, leaving it moist and supple.  The steak was good, but not particularly memorable - it was a juicy, tender steak to be sure, but you don't eat at this type of restaurant to enjoy a cut of beef.

Finally, we were given a dessert platter, which included green tea ice cream, a couple of custard dishes, and fresh fruit.

We also had the non-alcoholic cocktail they make with a Japanese fruit whose name I don't recall (it's difficult to remember what you were served when you didn't see it on the menu); the waiter described it as something akin to a lemonade with a tinge of tangerine, drizzled with honey.

The service at Roka Akor was excellent; the waiter treated us almost like a guest in his home.  They gave us fresh plates twice throughout the meal and cleared the used dishes in a timely manner.  Roka Akor is a very upscale restaurant, and the prices certainly reflect it.

We had a very good meal here.  They certainly know how to excite the taste buds.  I wouldn't say, however, that this is a particularly good place to get sushi.  And if you're interested in value at all, it's certainly not the best place to get Japanese food.  If you eat at Roka, you won't ever be disappointed in the quality of your food, but you can get the same quality, the same dining experience, and the same creativity elsewhere for barely half the price.

For that reason alone, they don't deserve quite the amount of hype they get.  It is a very good place for sushi and other Japanese cuisine, but not the best place to get it."}
{"text":"Tasty, tasty, tasty! And beautiful inside-great place for a date : )

I came here for a lunch date with groupon and it was a fantastic deal. 

I will definitely go back to Roka Akor maybe for a special occasion."}
{"text":"AMAZING. but the Omakaze (Chefs Choice) menu for 4 people was way too much food. Would do it again but take the the chefs menu instead."}
{"text":"I've been going to this great restaurant this since they opened.

 The service and the food is consistent and good value for money , you get what you pay for 

Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Like many sushi places you can wind up with a pretty hefty bill without trying that hard.  So use caution when you start ordering all the delicious entrees, particularly sushi samples.  

That said, if you have some money to spend this is a great place to do it.  They have fantastic sushi options, best I've had outside of the coasts.  The teriyaki and robata specialties are also outstanding but what really impressed me was the grilled vegetables, specifically the asparagus and brussel sprouts.  They were SO GOOD!!!  You expect sushi and grilled meats to be tasty but when they can make vegetables sing like this you know you are dealing with a really special place.

Service was top notch and the restaurant itself is stylish and sleek."}
{"text":"Came here with the family. The sushi was decent, nothing to rave about. However, the pork belly was amazing and so was the truffle filet. The place is cool and the sushi bar is inviting. The price is over the top for what you get."}
{"text":"Just absolutely amazing food. It could possibly the best sushi/Asian fusion food I have had. The Brussels sprouts and scallops dynamite roll were off the chain but the black cod is where it's at. Love the shochu infusions. Happy hour drink prices are pretty good. We will be back! oh and we love the lounge area in the bar."}
{"text":"Had to update my review because we had such a great time here last night! 
Due to our lack of ability to ever plan anything in advance we walked in at about 9pm on a Friday without a Resi and got told there would be a wait for a table. Not surprised! 
So we parked at the bar and enjoyed a Whiskey & a Pinot Grigio & the Sea Salt Edamame.
But we ended up having so much fun gabbing w Leigh the bartender that we decided to just hang there for dinner and are so glad we did! 
Her knowledge of Bourbons so impressed my Man that he had 4 drinks and we ended up \"stumbling\" out of there at closing about 3 hours later! So fun!!!
And then there was also the Sushi, the freshly grated Wasabi and the open kitchen show which is great entertainment! 
Started w Jalepeno laden Yellow Tail Sashimi that had an awesome side Salad w Pickled Red Onions (fantastic crunch).
Then enjoyed the Crispy Squid w Spicy Aioli, the Monkfish Tataki w crunchy Pea Purée, the Scallop Skewers w Lemon Aioli, the Farm Salad w added Grilled Octopus (great suggestion by Leigh!) and finished w the Himachi Serrano Chili Roll as our dessert! 
We wish you would come to Orange County already so we could bring each and every one of our Sushi loving friends to your epic establishment!!!
Fans of Roka Akor for life!"}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best food I have had in a long time.  My husband and I eat out a lot, but as people often do, we get stuck going to the same places.  So this time we tried the Roka, it was delicious.  I am not a huge connoisseur of Sushi or Japanese dining overall, but if you're new, they help you choose some of their signature dishes and your old favorites are to die for. 

We were able to get out of there for just over $100...but we drank a lot of wine, so that helped our bill push the $100 mark :)"}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back!  I was here for the yelp event also and was so impressed with Roka Akor.  I won't go into much detail about the food since everyone else has described them quite well.  My favorite was the butterfish tataki... my mouth is watering just thinking about it.   The food was excellent, the service was flawless... you would have never guessed that it has only been open a month."}
{"text":"Experience was phenomenal. Our waiter Rick was so attentive and went above and beyond. He recommended a great bottle of red in our price range and recommended great plates. Would recommend this place for anyone looking for fresh sushi and great service !"}
{"text":"A little known fact is that \"Roka Akor\" actually stands for \"amazing service and steak\" in German. Went here with the girlfriend, and from the second you walk in, it does feel a little like Las Vegas posh. the layout was pretty trendy and the atmosphere was as expensive as the menu. But this was one of the few times I believed the high quality of the food properly dictated the menu prices. A dinner for 2....bring a benjamin (or for our older crowd, $100 - that includes the tip.)

We started with the Roka Akor Kimchi Dumplings which had kobe beef in them. Let's get this straight, I greatly dislike Kobe Bryant and everything that he stands for, but his beef is amazing. It comes in 5 pieces and instead of having to split the last one, my girlfriend graciously offered it to me and I ate that boy up before she finished her sentence. Our second appetizer was the Hamanchi Serrano Chili Roll. If it sounds spicy, it's because it is. This was the first time I ate sushi without the soy sauce. It had a solid kick to it, but for the ones that have a weak stomach, you could probably scrape off the wasabi mayo it comes with.

For the entree, I had the Prime Hangar with Chili Ginger Sauce and she had Prime Skirt Steak with Sweet Garlic Soy. The Hangar was buttery and tender, perfectly cooked to my medium well specifications. Previously, the \"best steak I ever had\" award went to the Arizona Inn in Tucson, but Roka Akor has now usurped that title. The Skirt steak was a bit drier, but the sauce it came with complemented it well. But at the end of the night, we both agreed that the Hangar was better. 

As for service, it was amazing. The waiter explained every special off the menu, and gave prices for each item...which has never happened at any other restaurant i've been too. I usually have to ask the waiter, \"oh, and how much is that special you just listed?\" And every time my glass was empty, it was filled within seconds. The waiter wasn't overly friendly, he just seemed like he was a master at his art, it was pretty wild to see him work. 5 star service at a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Although Roka can be a bit speedy, food is high quality and keeps me coming back!  Try happy hour - the bill is reasonable.  Service is also very good, very attentive staff!!"}
{"text":"Butterfish Takahi was as great as ever!

Also tried a fancy roll this time and sashimi platter.  Its AWESOMELY FRESH.  I was actually impressed by the freshness of the fish.  Its expensive, the furniture is uncomfortable and something about the place is just douchey or something, but the fish is fresh and it tastes very good.  I would like to go back, but need a willing victim that doesn't mind a weird atmosphere and uncomfortable seating.  :/"}
{"text":"Serving what seem to be impeccable service and standards, Roka Akor pays incredible homage to what Japanese cuisine is, was and will be in the distant future. Besides the somewhat shakey service, the food and ambiance are beaten to perfection with the branch of a Bonzai. Even the ice for the cocktails are carefully crafted to fit perfectly into the glass. Every now and then you can see the bartender sawzalling away at big blocks of ice for the drinks including the ones made with their homemade shochu.

With a menu full of fish flown in from Japan, I ordered a wide array of their specialties to get a better idea of why Bon Appetit magazine rated this restaurant Top 10 in the nation. I started off with their salad with wasabi ginger dressing. It had a great balance of fresh greens and roasted vegetables. Then came the butterfish tataki. With a clean unobtrusive tone, it would blow the shingles off Roy Yamaguchi on his bestest night. The American side of me flourished next with an order of the chili serrano hamachi roll. Far from anything exotic or novel, it flew under my radar much faster than Flight 447. Without giving up hope, the chef's sashimi selection came with scallop, tuna, and salmon. The freshness and quality was so conspicuous that the only adulteration I could sense was from the molestation it took by the TSA from its recent flight. 

The food was coming out with precision timing and I was thoroughly enjoying my honeycomb shochu throughout the entire meal. The sweet potato tempura and sweet buttered corn came next. Unfortunately, the sweet potato was of the North American genus that has the orange hue rather than its Asian counterpart with more of the clear hue. The sweet buttered corn made up for the prior disingenuous buffoonery. Much like the butterfish, it was another highlight of the night with its sweet ghee flavor and texture much difficult to execute on a grill. Lastly, the glazed baby back ribs came about. It tasted like it had been slowly cooked for hours. Tender with well-balanced burnt marks, it finished me off with an ending quite more than happy. 

The dinner was coming to a close and I have to admit I was thoroughly impressed with almost every aspect of this establishment. However, there are two things I'd like to see a change. Find a new source for sweet potatoes and get a water filtration system because the tap water tastes way too tappy. Starbucks has one and they're nowhere near eloquent as Roka. Until next time."}
{"text":"This is one of my top fave spots to canoodle or catch an endless cup of belly laughs with girlfriends. Personally prefer sitting at the bar or sushi table. Definitely the blood orange margarita will kick off your night or if you like to be a bit frisky, try the Hani Pru with the sochu. Amaze balls!!!

There's nothing that wouldn't satisfy the palate, whether you are a meat and potatoes type or the foodie adventurist like myself. During the summer, they have $1 oysters in the bar and who can resist slurping up that kind of goodness? Besides, the eye candy in the bar is as appetizing as the food. I prefer grazing over multiple selections of apps and sushi rolls. However, if you decide to truly dine, go with the tasting menu. It's an experience you have to indulge in at least once. The chef is always going to wow you!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday during Happy Hour, bought 3 rolls and 2 appetizers, still came to $60....so not too impressed with \"happy hour\", especially since the food was not great. 

Ordered the dumplings which were awesome, but the fried squid was sub par. 

Had 3 of the sushi rolls and all were pretty awful. Wouldn't go back here again for dinner, maybe just for drinks and dessert!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant.  In fact, my husband hosted my birthday dinner here last year.  I dream of lobster tempura and the rice hot pot and yuzu on everything and especially yuzu ice cream."}
{"text":"We celebrated Valentine's Day here this past weekend. My husband and I ordered the prix fixed menu. Wow!!  Once the food started coming, it just kept coming. And thank god!!  Bc it was all so delicious and tastey.   Our daughters order the salmon sashimi. It was like butter. So soft and fresh!!    The only part of the prix fixed menu that was disappointing was the dessert. Such a wonderful meal ending on a subpar note. But it was only our dessert, bc our daughters ordered the green tea tart and a chocolate cake with honey ice cream. Both were scrumptious!  Absolutely delicious. I wish we could have ended on the same note. Luckily they shared so we got to enjoy it anyways. The Dessert is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"phenomenal fresh seafood and a great value!  extremely friendly service.  would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First off this is NOT Sushi Roku.  SERVICE is good and as to be expected in a restaurant in scottsdale.  The food was flavorful.  Portion sizes tend to be on the small side.  Surf and turf special at $70 was small and not worth the price tag.  Drinks are sub par for price.  And desert again is light and small.  Overall food was good but we left hungry and thirsty for real drinks.  We do not plan on ever returning.  There are so many better options within the area."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service was awful.  If I'm paying those prices I expect great service and unfortunately that didn't happen.   I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing...if you are feeling generous..try \"Chef's special\" for $98 or $128. I tried several incredible dishes that I wouldn't have if I had just ordered from the menu. I was taken care of really well..tried 8-9 types of dishes followed by an amazing line-up of dessert. I could hardly walk after eating for ~3 hours. AMAZING EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the desert!  Been here twice now and both times I was very impressed.  Service here was impeccable and I really enjoyed the Shochu - they serve it with an ice wedge chipped off a block of very clear ice.  The highlight for me was the green tea creme brulee for desert - and when I think of the best deserts I've ever had, this one always comes to mind.  I also enjoyed their vegetable skewers and the sweet potato was out of this world.  I also ordered a pre-dinner salad and it was super fresh.  For dinner, the sushi melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"This place is really amazing- the food & ambience!  The butterfish melts in your mouth, the lamb is tender with delicious spice and the Shishito Peppers are yummy!  Something for everyone- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice place, attentive server and food presentation beautiful.  Food is delicious but EXPENSIVE.  Three adult meal cost us about $200.  Would go for special occasions but not on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The surf and turf with bison and tiger prawn shrimp was delicious! Great atmosphere but a little pricey. My sushi came out wrong the first time so that's why I'm giving it 4 of 5 stars. The food was definitely fresh!"}
{"text":"I honestly thought this was going to be the best meal ever.  Between all the hype and my love of unique and trendy places how can could it be less than stellar?

Armed with a big and adventurous appetite as well as a $80 gift certificated I got from LocalDines for $40 (http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ...best deal around), my wife and I headed to Roka for an early dinner on Friday night.

The place was pretty dead which was good, but became steadily more crowded as the night progressed.  The decor is nice and pretty standard for a trendy Scottsdaley place.  Our waiter was excellent and pretty helpful as well.  I don't really have any complaints about the place or the service.  My issue is with the price, food and all the people that say it is \"amazing\".

Here is what we had.  My goal was to try as much of their stuff as possible mainly using Yelp reviews as a guide.

* Shochu Sampler = interesting and pretty good.  Not worth the $18 for 3 shot glasses, but you should try shochu at least once.
* Edamame = standard
* Butterfish Tataki = standard
* Pork Belly = good
* Grilled Chicken = good but needed more sauce
* Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll = standard
* Rock Shrimp Tempura = standard

We also ordered 1 each of their robata grilled skewers.  99% of them aren't on skewers so I don't know why they call them that.  Anyway, they were all pretty good but are just basically grilled vegetables and nothing that special.  The sweet corn was excellent and definitely the standout \"skewer\".

While nothing on the menu is insanely priced, it is a bit high for what you get.  I'm ok with paying too much just so long as the food tastes superior to what I would get at RA."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the bar and it was delicious.  Chris was the bartender and he made the evening enjoyable with his recommendations on food and drinks.  The oysters (kushi) were amazing and so was the uni. The hamachi and wagyu rolls, mushroom skewers and tiger prawn tempura were made with the highest standards.  We were impressed.  The martini cocktails - wait list and saketini -were well balanced and awesome.   Absolutely loved our first encounter with Roka Akor.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We checked this place out for drinks and thought it was pretty cool!  Good location, great atmosphere and decent drinks!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and keep going back.  I'm such a sushi fan so I naturally gravitate towards the sushi menu.  I will say their sushi is not the best.  

HOWEVER! They have some of the most fantastic Japanese food that doesn't include sushi that I have ever had.  The miso soup is amazing.  I'm very picky about my miso soup and this one is probably the best I have tried.  They have a seasoned broccolini on the menu that we were hesitant to try but opted for it since it sounded like such an interesting blend of flavors.  It was FANTASTIC!  Their fish is top of the line and seasoned just right.  The portion sizes are perfect and the hot jasmine tea is a must with the fish.  

The service the first time I went about a year ago was sub-par.  I've been back a number of times and haven't had an issue so they must have made some sort of positive change.  The atmosphere is beautiful as well.  

Great spot but if you are a traditional sushi fan step outside of your comfort zone on a Japanese menu and try some of their regular dishes.  You will not be let down."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple girlfriends for the happy hour on Saturday and we were very pleased with it. They have happy hour everyday from 4.30-7 in the lounge area only. I really liked the atmosphere there - very relaxed and comfortable with about half of the lounge filled during the time we were there. Keep in mind this was on a Saturday so it might be totally different on the the weekdays, I would imagine it would be a lot louder and crowded. 
The happy hour menu is pretty extensive. Here are what we ordered: butterfish tataki (I loved it, my friends were ok with it), grilled pork belly with side of kimchi (we all loved it!! it was perfectly grilled with the meat tasting so tender and full of the delicious wood-smoked flavor), Chirashi roll (another great dish - the fish on it was really fresh), Calamari (great), roast duck with udon noodles (great but pretty spicy), grilled beef yakiniku (just ok), Cremini mushrooms (good), Kobe beef and kimchi dumplings (just ok). I might have left out a couple dishes but that's what I can remember now :) I tried the Hani-pru and mojito. Hani-pru was really good, the mojito was just ok - I couldn't really taste the alcohol. 
Service was also good, the servers were quick and polite but not overly friendly, which was just perfect. 
Overall I loved the food and its presentation, albeit the smaller portions. It's a great place to hang out and enjoy great food and conversation during a Saturday happy hour. Will try the full dinner menu next time."}
{"text":"It never ceases to amaze me...that people think the food here is average and overpriced.

GO to  a diner !!! bar  or pizzeria.

This cuisine is prepared carefully and with excellent ingredients. 

Short of Shin Bay Omakase it's the best overall cuisine of it's type in the valley.

If you don't know what that means...anywhere will do."}
{"text":"Okay...I've read the reviews here and I've been to just about every sushi joint in Scottsdale which is why I can't figure out why everyone is so hyped up about this place. My wife and I went for happy hour tonight based on all the great reviews from here. We ordered 4 things off of the HH menu and one drink each. Final Bill...$50. The short ribs were for the most part fatty (Chelsea's Kitchen has the best) and everything else was served in extremely small portions. As far as actual taste goes...it was just okay. Sapporo has some of the better sushi and other menu items but I'm kind of pissed at them right now for totally changing their happy hour around. They held the #1 spot for the longest time and then they went and changed it. They still have awesome food though and great sushi. 

The decor at Roka was very trendy looking so I can see how it would be popular with the clubbies. Service was very good and I had no complaints in that area. Basically, the food was just okay. 

Anyway...go try it for yourself and if I'm wrong then maybe it was just our experience."}
{"text":"Roka Akor wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. And considering how much the evening cost- it should have been. The service was slow and our waitress was all over the place. We had to wait for at least 20 minutes to even order drinks. The rolls were subpar at best. Even the small sushi places like Hana or sushi J do a much better job.  We ordered a sashimi platter that looked great. It tasted good. It was $120 and we each had a half a piece of each fish. A couple of dishes from the kitchen were also good. Considering how long we had to wait for everything, they really should have offered at least a desert for us to split. Meeeeh."}
{"text":"Ordered the omakase which they kindly did as a single order.  Decent food but pacing of order presentation was either two plates at once or long waits in between. I mean looooooong waits between courses at times.

The service was pleasant and the open robata and sushi kitchen area is a nice touch."}
{"text":"So excited when I got an email and facebook posting telling me to try the new Roka lunch.. ehhh.. after I drove with my friend from PV to Roka.. raving about the sushi and grill.. and telling her that she would LOVE it.. I found Roka empty.. seriously, we were the only ones in the place.. huh.. bad sign.. Im optimistic. The seating is in the bar area.. the menu is truly limited.. there are only 3 sushi rolls to choose from! WHAT???? I asked if I was missing the sushi menu, because in truth, I was disappointed.. I came for good sushi.. and NOW I was offered only 3.. not really a fan of serrano or yellow fin.. I ordered that roll over the salmon option.. and the avacado roll.. had a salad.. and $50 later.. Im leaving wanting more.."}
{"text":"We had a large group of friends visiting out of town and everything we ordered was delish..."}
{"text":"Just read my wife's review and thought I should add my 2 cents in. Very upscale place with great ambiance and service.  We went with another couple and had a fun evening. On the down side it was a little pricey. I'm not one who's big into sushi but we tried the platter. It was interesting, but the next day I felt a little under the weather. Place is worth a try."}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant is absolutely stunning.  I loved the giant sushi bar in the middle of the restaurant.  We sat at the sushi bar and it was really fun to watch them prepare food all night.

We started off with a couple of drinks, I got the pink mojito which I really enjoyed, it wasn't sweet which was perfect for me, my husband got a sochu which he ended up not liking very much.  We ordered the butterfish tataki, kobe beef and kimchi dumplings, tempura shrimp, himachi serrano chili roll, and spicy tuna roll.  They brought the butterfish out first; it was good but not as good as some of the other reviews made it out to be.  The dumplings and shrimp were next, the dumplings tasted like regular dumplings you could get at any Asian restaurant and the shrimp were average as well.  At this point I started getting a little nervous that we were about to spend a lot of money on a very average meal.

That all changed when they brought out the sushi.  This is the best sushi I've ever had in my life.  It's the best quality fish I've ever seen which made it worth every penny.  We had barely made a dent in our sushi when I asked for the menu to order more!  We got another himachi roll, another tuna roll, and a soft shell crab roll.  The only small complaint I have about the sushi menu is that it's very limited.  I wish they'd expand it a bit.

We ended our meal with a chocolate cake that was served with peanut butter ice cream peanut brittle and caramel sauce.  It was very good but I could only take a couple of bites because I was stuffed.  My husband didn't mind, he cleaned the plate!  I think if we hadn't been at a restaurant he might have licked the bowl.

The service at Roka Akor is amazing as well.  Our waiter was extremely attentive and knew every item on the menu like the back of his hand.  He was also really great about my husband's food allergy.  My husband is allergic to avocados.  He wrote on the ticket that my husband had a food allergy and double checked before our food was served. He also offered to take the sochu off of our bill since my husband didn't like it, we declined but it was still really nice of him to offer.   Our bill was $130 which isn't too bad considering how much food we got.  We will definitely go back, but next time we'll skip everything else besides the sushi."}
{"text":"Roka Akor has many creative and tasty choices. We opted to try several small dishes over the entrees and every dish was amazing. The sashimi was the freshest I've ever had. I also recommend the butterfish tataki and salmon nigiri. The shishito peppers, sweet potatoes, and corn are excellent vegetable options. 

The service at Roka Akor is phenomenal. The servers are perfectly trained, knowledgeable, and considerate. Several people assist the waiter with delivering dishes, drinks, cleaning, and questions. They all work to ensure that customers have a wonderful experience.

The prices are a little high, but completely worth it for the quality, service, and ambiance. It's easy to run up a high bill, so I recommend bringing a Groupon-style coupon.

Roka Akor is one of the finest places that I have dined and I highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"The BEST restaurant in the USA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The burnt tomato salad, and anything from the robata menu are all musts:)

Beautiful atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Food is amazing staff is great! I recommend sitting at the sushi bar and enjoying the show. If you like HOT, ask for the ghost pepper sauce... WOWZA... I love hot, but this is really hot!"}
{"text":"Roka Akor features top-quality sushi, outstanding service, and some interesting cocktail all wrapped in a tastefully appointed, airy dining room.

I'm hesitant to give it 5 stars, since I generally feel a little ripped off by the portion size and the bill tipping over $100 for my wife and I even at happy hour, but I realize that's what Roka Akor is. It's not somewhere you stop in for your monthly sushi unless you're Warren Buffett or something (who, I assume, prefers beef). Roka Akor has to feature the best fish in Arizona...I just wish there was more of it.

Oh, and the Roasted Duck with kimchee for $6...(kisses fingertips)...a superb value. GET IT. The butterfish, too. At least once."}
{"text":"I saw there was a groupon recently for this place and it reminded me that I had not reviewed this place on Yelp so I am here doing it. We went her for my girlfriend's birthday and the servers pushed us into ordering a premium Omakase menu where the chef picks different items based on your tastes. Everything tasted good and compliments to the chef but our bill with a couple drinks came out to $600!!!!  We were hungry less than an hour later as the portions were less than appetizer sizes. I wish we ordered a steak and sushi and called it a night. Instead, I feel like we got the Roka Akor hustle. If I was to have sushi, I highly recommend Yasu by PV mall. AMAZING... it is pricey but you will not reach anywhere near $600. The service was not $600 worth of service and there is no way I would ever want to eat or spend that much in one night on two people. Roka Akor got all its money it will ever be seeing from me."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever encountered. We were seated quickly but then dat a full 15 minutes prior to being offered water.  We then sat for approximately 30 minutes before one of the bar employees walked over and politely said excuse me I've noticed that you have been waiting a long time is something I can get you from the bar.  We ordered a drink and some oysters and he promptly brought us the oysters while my companion went to speak to the host who assured him he would make it up to us with the best service while he was speaking to him our waiter finally made an appearance we politely informed him someone had already taken care of us and once our drinks came requested our bill as we would rather give our patronage to another establishment. Very disappointing to say the least"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant but when compared to similar sushi restaurants in the same price range it isn't spectacular. 
Really loved the seared scallop dynamite maki. 
The fish is good quality here and they do have a good selection - including o toro and chu toro and amberjack. 
The miso black cod was a good portion size. It was good but I prefer the Chilean sea bass. 
The mushroom hot pot is okay. The Chicago option has a truffle version which I think is way better. I didn't see a truffle option here. 
Overall for about 100 pp I've def had better. But again nothing against this place as it was still good but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night in the summer with a large group. Odd thing was when we walked in for our reservation at 9 the place was almost completely empty and looked like it was going to be closing very soon....and again this was a Friday night....maybe they eat early out here. 

This isn't your standard sushi spot. Although the sushi and Japanese specialties are good here, the steaks are the best plates Roka offers. 

Started off with Shishito Peppers, Bone Marrow, Tataki, Pork Belly (excellent), Fried Squid and the well known Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll. All great choices but many may be turned off by the Bone Marrow appetizer. It's an interesting dish and not for all. For dinner went with the Korean spice rubbed Lamb Chops and split a Prime NY Strip. Everyone who got steaks said it was excellent..no complaints. The only turnoff was the waitress. When you go out with a large group of people you want to relax, enjoy and have a good time...not be in and out in under an hour. Definitely was getting that vibe that is was Friday night and she was looking to get out of there to go out for the night. Guess I can't blame her."}
{"text":"Roka Akor is all hype and very little substance.  Service is courteous and knowledgeable; however, be prepared to be rushed.  My wife and I had four courses and several glasses of wine in under an hour, not by choice.  The table next to us even sent back several of their courses because they were still eating prior courses.  Given the prices, this type of table turning is inexcusable, especially considering there were several open tables.  

The o toro shashimi and butterfish tataki are fantastic.  If you have never had fresh wasabi, be prepared to be blown away.  One of our courses, the chicken and leek robata was inedible.  Basically, it was burnt, flavorless chicken on a stick.  When the floor manager cleared our plates, we expressed that we didn't care for the dish and he simply looked at us like we were speaking another language.  One of our main dishes was the madagascar prawn.  Flavor was excellent, presentation was cool, but the prawn was totally overcooked.  We explained to our server that the prawn was overcooked and once again, nothing.

In my opinion, Roka Akor is designed for impressing someone that has little concern for proper execution.  Ideally, have drinks and sushi at the bar and then head elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Roka Akor is the best sushi experience I've had thus far in my life. Granted, I've lived in Arizona for almost my full 18 years, so I'm no that experienced when it comes to a refined sushi/seafood palette. 

My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday, and he found a Groupon. $25 for $50 worth of food. An excellent deal. We'd both never been here, and he thought it would be nice to surprise me, and oh yes it was! 

The place has excellent decor, very minimalistic and simplistic, however it gives off a very nice and modern vibe. We had a reservation, so we were sat immediately. Probably the whole downside to the entire meal was that it was a tad bit cold in the seating area. But hey, if that's the biggest downside, then count me in anytime!

We had the nicest and most attentive waiter. It had been such a long time since we have gotten decent service at a restaurant. We were greatly pleased that the waiter would fold our napkins as we set them down and pour our drinks for us. He was extremely polite and seemed to have a vast knowledge of the menu. I also liked how he didn't mind at all that we were using a Groupon. There have been countless times where I have had waiters and waitresses dish out attitude for using Groupons or Yelp check-in offers. 

Being that it was my birthday dinner and that we had a Groupon, we decided to go all out. We got the Butterfish and Rock Tempura Shrimp as appetizers. The butterfish came out first. Small portion but PACKED with flavor. Extremely tender and melt-in-your-mouth fish quality. I really don't even know how to describe the taste. It was such a delicate and nice mix of a ton of flavors, that it's truly hard to explain. It was savory, but had sweetness to it, and at the same time it had like a citrusy tang. A strong 10/10. The rock tempura shrimp was literally the best shrimp dish I have ever eaten in my entire life. Tempura is easily messed up at a ton of sushi joints. This tempura was amazing. It was far from greasy, was perfectly flaky, and had a very delicate taste. It came with a chili mayonnaise that was out-of-this-world to die for! The serving size was also very large, which was nice. 

Then our rolls came. We orderd the hamachi serrano chili roll, the dynamite scallop roll, spicy tuna roll, and crispy prawn roll. Seriously. The best freaking sushi I've ever eaten. My favorite was the hamachi serrano chili roll. They were all very delicately balanced in flavor, and came as pretty hefty portions. It's about 8/9 pieces per roll, and each one was so delicious! 

By then, our tab was almost around $90 before the Groupon, so we decided to opt out. I have never been so pleased with a sushi meal in my life. The waiter came, gladfully took our Groupon, and seemed happy to serve us. 

Overall, this is one of the only restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area that gets a perfect 10/10 on all dining aspects. Seriously. Ambiance, food quality, service, everything is a perfect 10. I will definitely be back! Probably with more Groupons!"}
{"text":"I think Roka Akor is amazing and I tell everyone I can think of about it.  Maybe, it's because I had my first date with my love here, but no, it's because of the pork belly.  Or wait, the butterfish crudo?  Could it be the black cod?  The brussels sprouts?  The simple grilled asparagus that is so delicious?

I think it's the combination of extremely high quality food and some cool bartenders who make really good shochu infusions and are friendly enough to tell you about the process and give you their suggestions.  I suggest the cosmo made with an infused shochu (pear if they have it or cranberry is good too!).  This isn't for people who think that a high priced dish should equal a mountain of food, but if truly respect and value quality food, you will like this place a lot.  I will say the pork belly is the absolute best I have ever had.  The happy hour is really good too, and those little burgers are freakin delicious! Ask for the baby burgers during happy hour, they are sooooo good!  If they allow you to order the beets as a side dish do it!  Normally they are a garnish for a dish, but solo, the heirloom beets with chives are truly my favorite side dish of all time.

I like that Roka offers you something whether you want to splurge and indulge or if you just want something inexpensive for happy hour and a drink on your way home.  They don't try to be one way or the other and maybe more people need to know that they do offer something for everyone (everyone who appreciates good food, that is!)"}
{"text":"First visit and we ordered what the waiter suggested, it was absolutely fantastic! Everything he brought out was great, we ate family style and tried a bunch of new items.
Pork Belly, scallops, Prime Rib Eye, Chilean seabass and cremini mushrooms. All really good with powerful flavors!"}
{"text":"Great bar area, specialty cocktails, and attentive service.  A long-awaited return... And will definitely be back soon!  Go and try the unique schochu infusions..."}
{"text":"I came here a while back with a Groupon (the only way to bring the price of dinner down into my affordable range!).  I sat at the bar, which was a great way to enjoy the aromas of all the different varieties of meat cooking on the robata grill.  Everything was quite good, and the service was attentive and friendly.  I got the butterfish tataki and diver scallops, both of which were quite good.  I also got passionfruit and mango mochi for dessert, and really enjoyed those as well.  But the highlight of the night, hands down, was the pork belly.  It was crispy on the outside, meltingly tender on the inside, smelled amazing, TASTED amazing (sweet, umami... yum).  It was a revelation, and I do mean that in the religious sense of the word.  Definitely worth coming back for (even without a Groupon)!"}
{"text":"Amazing. If you don't love it, you're out of your mind. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"For one thing, I'd like to let everyone know that Roka Akor officially has the best looking male staff ever.  I mean, are they kidding me with this? It's like they were ordered from a damn Abercrombie catalog.  At the risk of sounding like a total creeper (too late), that was almost as good as the food.

All creepiness aside, a coworker took me here for a belated birthday dinner using a localdines.com coupon and everything was perfect from start to finish. To start with, she somehow got her dates mixed up and the coupon had actually expired in August, but the awesome manager reissued her a new one AND let her use it on a Saturday (despite the new stipulations saying otherwise), which was very, very nice of her, considering it saved us $80 on our meal.

We both got the Summer Tasting menu. The softshell crab salad appetizer was incredible. The roasted peppers were very good too, but seriously, just get the soft shell crab. I mean, it's freaking deep fried crab. We also had an order of butterfish tataki because we had heard amazing things about it. It wasn't QUITE the mouthgasm I expected, but I think that may have been a result of obscenely high expectations. It was still very good.

I got Salmon as my entree which had an awesome charred finish and really good flavor. She got the cumin rubbed pork, which was perfectly seasoned and pretty much amazing all around.  The portions are way larger than I would expect for a fancy schmancy place like this. I don't even know how someone would finish a whole tasting menu, considering they give you like a pound of rice (which is more like a delicious mushroom risotto) for two people. We definitely couldn't finish it, but we still managed to pretty much inhale the green tea custard with banana foam dessert. So, so, SO good. 

Our server was very personable and knowledgeable on both the menu items and the history of the restaurant. They were also awesome enough to bring us two glasses of champagne after dessert for my birthday! They said they usually do free dessert, but since we already had dessert with our tasting menu, I got booze instead! Always an appropriate substitution.

I thought the menu would actually be a lot pricier than it is, but it's really not bad enough that I can't see myself returning in the near future, particularly for the atmosphere (and by atmosphere I mean hot waiters...okay seriously, I'll stop now).

Definitely a five star experience! Can't wait to go back to try the sushi."}
{"text":"Another fantastic foodie date night!  

We sat at the bar, overlooking the busy open kitchen, while hubby sipped his Pinot Noir and I savored my Pink Mojito!  Prickly pear puree, rum, yuzu and crushed ice topped the tallboy...what more could you want in a drink?  Spicy fried calamari came while we waited for our surprise (because we could barely understand our server).  

The Delux Sashimi is one of the best we've had.  The amazing iced presentation consisted of ahi toro, kunomoto oysters, sweet delicate scallops, sliced Alaskan crab, slices of fluke, fresh red ahi, albacore sushi and duck sashimi...yes, you heard me...duck sashimi!  Oh my, we were surprised at how much we liked that one.  The melange of fresh sashimi was served with a simple freshly grated wasabi and  a sprinkling of sea salt.   

Sweet dreams are made of these..."}
{"text":"You've gotta give Roka Akor credit for the ambiance. Super-cool. We sat at the grill and were so intrigued watching the sushi chefs create amazingly ornate displays of raw seafood. And the signature Robata grill was overflowing with grilled meats and fish. I'm definitely glad we chose to sit there rather than at a table. Way more entertaining, though a group of more than two people would definitely be more comfortable at a table.

I love the idea of this place - small plates, so you can try multiple items without getting super full. I ordered the small Chef's Sashimi platter first, which was really delicious. And I LOVED the presentation. Mountains of ice and garnish, fresh grated wasabi?! So good. I also ordered the miso black cod, which was cooked and served in some sort of leaf. Very interesting and well cooked, but not my favorite flavor.

Overall, this place was really good. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5: I'm not sure it was worth what we paid (about $100 + tax/tip for two people). I'll definitely be back, but might just stick with sushi next time."}
{"text":"This review is for lunch.  I've been here for dinner twice and though food / service / ambiance is excellent - I'm not hip enough for it.  Recently, thanks to Yelp, I was looking for a sushi place, for lunch with the girl's and came upon Roka Akor.   I saw that they served lunch and that they had a special.  And special it is! Soup, salad and THREE hand rolls.  For such a high end place the price was hugely reasonable.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  Think I'm gonna have to go back tomorrow now."}
{"text":"My second time visiting on a business trip and this place is impressive as you walk in. The open and modern decor with the open kitchen/robata area creates a great vibe.

We ordered a variety of dishes and enjoyed every one whether it was sushi, sashimi, rolls, miso cod, steak, etc. we finished off with the dessert platter and it was a nice end to a great meal.

I have been to the San Francisco location as well and every experience at Roka Akor is awesome."}
{"text":"Another pretentious Scottsdale restaurant filled with pretentious Scottsdale clientele ... You Betcha!

Get past that aspect and you'll find an awesome Japanese inspired menu served by a young and vibrant staff.  The open kitchen is centered around a large Robatayaki oak fired grill, with the cook staff just humping in all directions. (Finally a place in Arizona that understand's \"service\")  All the meats are to die for and the fish is flown in daily. While the dinner menu can get pricy, I do enjoy myself immensely \"over here\"!

The chef's offer several Omakase dinners that are \"without a doubt\" the finest available in the state of Arizona. 

A \"super-deal\" happy hour extends from 4:30 PM till 7PM (bar only), get your butt there early as this area tends to fill up quickly. As usual you'll find me hanging at the bar eating Poo Poos & Robatayaki off the stick. 

The bartender Alex makes these \"killer\" Shoju infusions that he brews up in the wine cellar. Some of them take weeks to perfect. He saws the ice for your drinks from this perfectly clear block that sits directly on the bar. 

Man this place just buzzes with excitement. 

See you there!"}
{"text":"I recently went here for happy hour after discovering Roka Akor on the Whistl app for iPhone. It showed me their happy hour items and I was more than impressed by what they had to offer.

We got got a couple \"Chibi\" Burger ($3), the Yakiniku Skewer ($5), the Brussel Sprouts ($5.50), and some of their amazing Shochu (50% off).  The slider was very flavorful. The meat was juicy and the wasabi aioli added a nice element to it. One thing I love about Roka is their sauces, all of them are top notch. The Skewers were also very good. More or less what you would expect, but the sweet garlic glaze really made the dish. The brussel sprouts are probably one of my favorite dishes from this place. They were crispy, with their own hose made mustard and bonito sauce. I never really liked brussel sprouts until I had them at Roka. The shochu is definitely a must if you have never tried it. I would compare it to a vodka-like drink, but infused with flavors that can make it even have a bourbony taste. I got the chile-melon flavor. The spice is very subtle, as well as the sweetness, which I liked very much. It was very refreshing, and very unique. I believe the flavors are all seasonal, so there's always something new to try!

After discovering them on Whistl, we have been back a couple times for their happy hour and their dinner. The dinner can be quite pricy, but it is worth every penny. Trust me, you will not be disappointed. This is now probably one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. The food is always perfect, and the service is second to none. Also, a great atmosphere.

If you're a foodie like me, and want to find great deals in the area, definitely check out Whistl for iPhone. It's free and no advertisements or sign up!

Happy Eatings!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat, the best sushi place in Arizona. A bit pricey but worth the extra as not one morsel is badly cooked or served. I suggest a reservation as they seem to be always packed. A bit hard to find for a newbie to that area. Loved the place."}
{"text":"The food, the service, the atmosphere! This place was the bomb! The butterfish tataki was melt in your mouth goodness and the highlight of the meal - but the oysters were also pleasing as was the squid and butterfish roll!  I don't think there is a dish that would be wrong!"}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend in AZ and despite some other friend's protestations to go to Sushi Roku we decided on Roka Akor instead.  What a great decision!  Both vegetarians and non-vegetarians were amazed at how good this place is!  If you are vegetarian and find yourself in the deserts of AZ you can't go wrong with Roka.

Great informative service too!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and sushi. Mediocre robata items. 

I had the best birthday dinner here about 3 weeks ago. The couple who brought me here had been here 2 other times, so I knew I was in for a treat. We sat at the sushi/robata bar, and since the menu was just so vast, we decided to do the omakase and let our chef bring out what he thought we would like. We told him we wanted to do mostly sushi. 

The amount of food we got was INSANE. I had never eaten so much in my entire life. The quality of their fish was outstanding. I was really impressed. Here's just a list of the things that we were served: butterfish tataki with white asparagus, beef tataki with a chili ponzu sauce, fried tofu with avocado and wasabi mayo, burnt tomato salad, fried oysters with ponzu and shisho, 2 large toro tuna rolls, 2 kinds of Spanish mackarel sashimi, tuna sashimi, yellowtail sashimi, sea bream sashimi, butternut squash tempura, yuzo marinated black cod, grilled wild Madagascan tiger praws, grilled pork belly, cold soba noodles in broth with quail egg and green onions, baby pork ribs with sweet corn in butter and soy, and grilled Shishito peppers with ponzu and bonito flakes.

Are you still reading this?!? We were so incredibly full, and they said they had some lamb cutlets for us too. Unfortunately, we had to turn them down and ask for dessert. 

Side note: The manager, William, knew we were there to celebrate my birthday, and he actually gave us a traditional shot of japanese sake. The drink was dry, and really smooth and was served in a tall shot glass placed inside a wooden box. It is customary to pour the sake so it overflows into the box for prosperity. When done sipping on the shot, you pour the remaining sake from the box into the glass and finish it. 

Back to the incredible dessert. We waited a good amount of time for our dessert and we were wondering why since they typically offer a sorbet. When they finally brought the dessert out, we were all amazed. Not only we were served ALL the flavors of sorbet, but also an assortment of fresh fruit. Here's another list: mangosteen, cherries, strawberries, kiwi, green tea custard w/banana foam, peanut butter sorbet, and yuzu sorbet. My hands down favorite was the yuzu sorbet. 

Overall, this place offers the best customer service, and they have a great selction of fresh fish. The items that were grilled were inconsistent. Sometimes it was overflavored, and other times the food was bland. I can't wait to go back here and just eat some sashimi.

I would also highly recommend the blood orange margarita and honeycomb shochu!"}
{"text":"Not what we thought it would be. Menu needs to have explanations under the names. Very hard to understand what the dishes are. Our dinner was interrupted by a very large cockroach that I ended up killing. Manager made it sound like its no big deal. We actually stood up and left along with a few other couples. Warm inside, asked a few times if the could adjust the temp. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious sushi ! Service is always good. Cocktails are strong as should be...:) We usually sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Roka Akor. Possibly the best summer happy hour in the area. Brilliant temporary value in this staple Scottsdale  Japanese fine dining joint. Grilled hamachi collar or black cod for $7.. I dare you to beat the \"chibi\" burger, an amazing little double size slider perfectly balanced for $3. Wait what? Love the decor, setting, lovely & friendly service.. How you turn this very upscale place into a bargain foodie experience is beyond me, but I applaud you. Summer after summer. Never stop. You make me happy. See you tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant ever! I love their ama ebi nigiri (sweet shrimp) and always craving for more. For this visit I tried their dynamite scallop roll and salmon roll (with asparagus inside) and it was so delicious makes me craving for more. The pork ribs were very delicate and it was melting in your mouth! What makes this restaurant to be my number one spot of Japanese restaurant in the valley was the sushi chef service is superb! They ran out ama ebi and I told the waitress that one of the reason I came there is for that ama ebi. The chef suddenly came back to me one hour later and said he saved one ama ebi for me!!! What a service!!!! I'm so thankful of this wonderful dining experience and will definitely become one of their regular customer!! Love this place so much!!"}
{"text":"We went to Roka Akor for happy hour this past weekend and had THE BEST JAPANESE FOOD EVER! 

What we ordered:
-\"Chibi\" Burger (3oz) with Homemade Sesame Bun   [MUST TRY]          
-Cremini Mushroom Burger with Wasabi Aioli   
-Robata Grilled Zucchini with Miso Mustard     
-Cremini Mushrooms with Soy garlic Butter     
-Sweet Corn Tempura                                              
-Seasonal Vegetables, Prawn, and Butterfish Tempura     
-Roast Duck with Kimchi Udon  [MUST TRY]
-Butterfish Tataki with White Asparagus and Yuzu  [MUST TRY]
-Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll  [MUST TRY]

What we loved:  Everything. Seriously, EVERYTHING!

Victoria did a great job describing  and giving suggestions (since it was our first time). Food was delicious and drinks (mojitos + maritinis)  were great.
Yes, it is expensive but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Very pricey but worth it. Great cocktails too.defintly a place for a special occasion"}
{"text":"The food was good over all but pricey. The a5-9 japanese wagyu was good.  Order all the different variety of sashimi which was decent. Cod was cooked well not too dry."}
{"text":"Whoever your server is, tell them to quit the business.  Ask for Shauna.  She knows how to take care of her customers.  God bless meat skewers.  Sake here never gives you a hang over.  The butterfish tataki will get you pregnant."}
{"text":"deeelicious! the veggies were by far the best part of the meal, and i may be so bold as to say the brussel sprouts are the best ive ever had (and ive had a LOT of brussel sprouts). It is a very classy establishment, reflected in the aesthetic plating of the food- the cod was served on an incredibly sturdy plate, sturdy enough for a caveman. not a good environment to whip out the age old 'chopsticks as walrus tusks' joke, though. Also try the dessert platter, its served on enough ice to stop global warming."}
{"text":"Roka Akor is amazing.  The sashimi is fresh and perfectly cut.  The desserts are also perfection.

Blue fin tuna flight was their special tonight and it was so delicious that I took a moment to close my eyes and indulge in the moment of the melting fresh fish in my mouth.  The rice hotpots are always good - I've had the mushroom rice hotpot with mountain vegetables and one with crab, both were delicious.  I've had steak both times I've been there and while it was very good, the sashimi, rice hotpot, and desserts are must haves."}
{"text":"El Torito is to mexican food what Roka Okur is to japanese food.  If you are AT ALL familiar with authentic japanese food (and service) - this is not a good place for you.  On the other hand - if you are not japanese and are aged 50+ and have never previously  been in an authentic japanese restaurant - this might be a place is for you!  This is americanized japanese food for folks who are unfamiliar with or uninterested in the real thing.

Note the happy hour has dramatically changed from what is posted on their corporate website.  Bait-and- switch!  (Seafood pun).  Gone are the HH items which most-intruiged us and prompted our trial visit in the first place...  Note HH is in the bar-only.

$3 bottles of Kirin and $5 (Masi) house wines.  The yakitori (chicken chunks slathered in teriyaki sauce with tiny bits scallion in between) was a gross americanized abomination.  The black cod skewers were not much better.  

$1 oysters are available on Thursdays (though we did not see any posting or mention of this 'special' in the restaurant - we asked about it because I saw it on their website) were passable given the cheap price.

The soft shell crab 'sandwich' ($6 at HH) is really just a mini-slider.  The best item we ordered was the butterfish tataki  - but our order was comprised of only four thin bite-sized slices for $6 during HH.  Not really much of a value. 

Will not return."}
{"text":"To my surprise, Roka Akor has happy hour all night in the bar area during the summer.  This is such an amazing deal.  I have gone a few times now, so have had several items from their happy hour menu.  I really love the tempura sweet corn. A nice, sweet and light snack.  Just the right amount of seasoning.  The slider was also really good.  I wish the pork belly and kimchi taco was delicious!  My favorite are the Brussel Sprouts.  The drinks a pretty good too.  I normally have the sochu.  It comes in several different flavors.  The honeycomb is my favorite.
Great service every time."}
{"text":"AWESOME

We went here for restaurant week

AWESOME

I had the butterfish app, spicy filet entree, and strawberry melon dessert

OMG

SOOO GOOOOOD!!!!

I'll totally come back to this place.  I love."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. This is a good place to go for a drink, but I'll never go back for sushi again. The sashimi was not especially fresh, the rolls were not memorable, and everything is overpriced. Even the happy hour menu was no good."}
{"text":"Best thing to do here is to sit at the bar and order their special infused drinks (which they serve with a freshly picked block of ice) and raw appetizers. Everything else tastes pretty 'standard.'"}
{"text":"A group of us went to Roka Akor to celebrate a birthday last weekend and this place does not mess around!

Everything is fresh and delicious. I'm not even the biggest fan of sushi, but I liked every single thing we tried. The spicy tuna rolls are perfect and they aren't afraid to use serrano peppers on their dishes.

The best thing? The COD. Oh my god - this cod changed my life! It melts in your mouth and the flavor is astounding. Everyone at the table couldn't get over this delicious dish!

I can't even think of anything bad to say about Roka. The ambiance is great, the staff is friendly and the drinks are boozy. 

If you have a bit of money to spend, I recommend going all out and getting the tasting menu. If not, their happy hour is affordable and includes a lot of the signature plates."}
{"text":"Ok words can't quite describe just how good I think this place it. My parents were in town for thanksgiving and then back again a few weeks later for graduation. After coming to Roka for the first time thanksgiving weekend my dad's first idea for dinner when they got back to town was to come again.

The family favorite on the menu is either the rice and mushroom hot pot or the butterfish. Both are fantastic. I could eat the hot pot for lunch alone. Nothing we had in either visit was bad but the let down was probably the kimchi dumplings, not becuase they weren't good but because all the other food just blew us away. The waygu beef sushi was fantastic and just melts in your mouth. Even the miso soup is better than any I have had before.

One of the best touches I saw was fresh grated wasabi coming with an order of tuna. I had never seen it grated right from the root before, only the green paste. It's small touches like this that makes Roka a step above the rest.

The housemade drinks (i think it's call surgue) are very good but they also have a very nice selection of alcohols. A martini with the ginger vodka is a great choice.

The service is also top notch with drinks being filled promptly, menu items being very well explained and just a great dining experience.

Hands down this has become a top 5 family favorite restaurant for us, worldwide."}
{"text":"Well, this is an old favorite Happy Hour. Food is 5 stars, but after many years, I was charged full price for a martini. Upon questioning, the manager did revert to happy hour with the message \"OK, this time...\". I was not asking for a favor, and felt the message sent back to be demeaning and snarky. I hate to let such a great restaurant go, but we probably won't be back.....far to many great restaurants so close by!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best sushi I have ever had. Anywhere. Small sushi menu, but everything I tried was fantastic. Restaurant has a cool atmosphere, good lighting and great service. Only complaint was it was pretty loud in there, more so than normal crowded restaurant loud felt like noises were echoing off the walls. But overall great spot for sushi"}
{"text":"One word....
Aaaaaahhhhhhmazing!!!!!

Lol try everything...like seriously, get one of everything. It's all so good."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday dinner and this place was pretty packed on a Saturday night. The atmosphere was pretty nice and the service  was good. We started off with some appetizers steamed edamame which was great, the calamari was good but I'm kinda used to dipping my calamari into some type of dipping sauce which they didn't have...it was just a piece of lime that came with it so it wasn't the best. There was also the Robata-Grilled Japanese Shishito Peppers with Ponzu and Bonito Flakes, this was ok but kind of an odd taste and its kinda spicy...i didn't like it too much. As a dinner entree we ordered the soft shell crab roll and let's just say I wasn't impressed. 

Overall, this place was way overpriced considering the fact that their sushi wasn't even that great. And I thought it was nothing really special.If it was good I would understand and wouldn't have mind, but it was just eh and didn't care for it. I probably wouldn't go back here for sushi maybe just for drinks or something."}
{"text":"Swanky, stylish decor!  Attentive service, stylish plating.  Limited sushi menu but they have options.  I had their 6 course tasting menu.  Very nice.  Miso soup a bit too salty for me, but others might like. Ginger ice cream was delicious, though, atop bread pudding. Cool bathroom, too."}
{"text":"Epic fail!!!!   Was sooo not impressed with this place.  So many people have said to go try it but I was not a fan.  Typical Scottsdale \"Groundhog Day\" style joint trying to be hip but i've seen it all before. The overpriced wine and food was not the worst part of the experiance.  The real issue was that I was ill for two days as if I had been to Mexico and drank the water!  Too many sushi options in this town and you really don't always get what you pay for at some.
Terrible, F"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Ribs and sushi were well prepared and fresh. Waitress and manager were attentive and spent quality time explaining to novices."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very trendy. This isn't getting 5 stars because the service was odd, I get bringing sushi and apps as they get ready, but if you order an entree and side you want them together.  A plate of sweet potatoes without steak or your sprouts after you finish your fish doesn't make any sense.  It was a big party, but still weird, would definitely go back for the food and hope for better timing!! :)"}
{"text":"Best sashimi eating experience in the Valley. 

When you come to Roka, do yourself and favor and spend the extra dollars to get the Omakasi! (you can get plain old sushi elsewhere)  After you order be prepared to spend 2-3hours leisurely enjoying your courses.  No sense rushing food this good.  Skip the soy sauce please--the fish is so fresh and flavorful, drowning it in soy would be a terrible waste.  The butterfish is perfectly dressed and tuna, salmon cuts are so delicate.  One particular cut of tuna was so wonderfully marbled, it melted upon contact with my tongue.  Dessert is just as nice, usually you finish with smooth ice cream flavors and fresh fruit.

I've been here several times now, and the service is always on point-waiters are attentive without being in your face.  The cocktails are also pretty good.  Although I've never tried their wine selection, they have enough selection on the menu to pass my inspection."}
{"text":"LOVE Roka Akor - the deliciously fresh tasting food, the trendy cool upbeat vibe in' ambiance, and the service here is impeccable!!

One of my boys from Chicago was feeling like heading out for sushi one night and suggested that we should come here, because he had been to their location in Chicago.  I didn't know what to expect other than he said it was waaay better quality food than Sushi Roku @ the W ... And he was not joking! The quality of food was much better here, and there was a lot more options! 

Since we didn't have any reservations and arrived fairly late - we sat @ the bar in the lounge area, and the bartender/server who took care of us rocked the house!  We ended up sharing/sampling several different things based on recommendations from the bartender.

THE FOOD:  Miso soup was def of high quality!! The scallops were amazing ...so light and delicious! The sushi was fantastic and that says a lot coming from someone who isn't a big sushi fan.  My fav was the Wagyu beef sampler we got, which was half traditional Japanese and half Australian cut - it was toooo die for out of this world - the best most tender perfectly cooked pieces of fine red meat I have ever had!! 

THE SAKI:  awesome, especially since our server recommended something that went well with our food choices.

The food, drinks, atmosphere, and service are all absolutely on point here!!  

But, this place is fairly expensive for the portion sizes, but keep in mind this is more of a gourmet type sushi experience - this is not the place that the average person can afford to frequent on a regular basis.  It's more of a special occasion type spot for most ... For that reason I have only been here a few times, and I deeply cherish the experiences I have had here ... It was the first time I had Wagyu beef and once you try it you will understand why it's sooooo pricey, but equally sooooo worth it once a year or so!! ;) 

I can't even think of one thing to criticize this place about ... They get it here.  Roka Akor is truly a fine Japanese style dining experience ... I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! ;)"}
{"text":"I finally tried Roka Akor!  It's been on my list of places but has somehow eluded me for years and years.  My boyfriend and I went here for a date night and it was absolutely perfect!  I love the ambiance and even though the restaurant is large, it feels intimate and like your own private dining experience, even though we were seated toward the middle of the restaurant.  Our waiter was top-notch, attentive, informative and friendly, but not invasive.  

The fish was so fresh.  We ordered the Chef's selection of sashimi (3 pieces), I absolutely loved the sashimi, it's definitely the best I have found in Phoenix!  We also tried the Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll (thanks to others Yelp advice) - it was so good, definitely put that on your order.  A little kick, but not too much heat.  The spicy tuna roll was phenomenal (I judge sushi restaurants by their spicy tuna rolls! haha). I think we tried scallops and a vegetable too - everything was so good. 

The presentation of the meal was beautifully done as well, it just added so much to an already enjoyable experience.  The food was also fresh and light and portions were the perfect size.  We walked out feeling satiated but not overstuffed, and we still had the chance to try a wide variety of foods. 

Hats off to the chef and staff at Roka Akor!  Thanks for being such a fabulous place!!  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Roka for years now and the food, service, atmosphere are all excellent.  We nearly always sit with Eugene who is attentive and knowledgeable, and now can practically do our ordering for us.  We bring our friends, employees, and even our kids to Roka and have never once left disappointed.  

Do not miss the BLACK COD!"}
{"text":"A wonderful place for an upscale meal!  Beautiful atmosphere, immaculate service, incredible presentation and top-notch food.  If it's this wonderful the next time, they'll be upgraded to five stars! 

FOOD: 
The waiter brought us complimentary Crunchy Calamari (he said the kitchen made too much) - it was excellent!  Soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside, with a fabulous black pepper and jalapeno kick, delish when drizzled with lime.  

The Butterfish was perfect - divinely dressed/seasoned and melts in your mouth.

My favorite item was the Miso Black Cod: dazzling presentation, tender but firm with miso flavor, carmelized on the top - luxuriously tasty.  On the side was a slightly sweet sauce that perfectly complemented the flavor of the fish with sesame seeds.

The Broccollini had light sesame ginger sauce so the smoky grilled flavor of the veggies could shine.  

Free White Chocolate Brownie with Yelp Check-In!  I 'm not generally a white chocolate fan, but this was lovely - not too sweet, topped with sweet cream ice ceam, pomegranite sauce and pecans.  Wonderful again!

SERVICE:
Our server was wonderful - his suggestions were our favorite parts of the meal, he was laid back (making us v comfortable), he timed everything perfectly and he treated us to an appetizer...even our water glasses sayed full - who could ask for anything more?  The hostess was a little strange, but not rude."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Very cool place with unique fresh dishes.

- they serve a rice liquor that's a touch weaker than vodka (good stuff)
- chee burger (awesome)
- steamed clams with red miso
- aspargus
- some sort of pot stickerish dish
- variety of sashimi

All great.  Plus, they usually have specials, which are fabulous."}
{"text":"Favorites: King Crab Pot, similar to risotto with fresh crab, grat portions compared to other dishes.  Black cod was amazing as were the side of mushrooms.  Butternut Squah tempura great, just wait for it to cool to be enjoyed!

It's great quality and atmosphere.  Not 5 stars in my book due to the price.  We also had a gift certificate, so we were lucky."}
{"text":"I like the ambience in this restaurant and I also like the taste of the food, but it is a bit overpriced for the tiny portions you get. We had the menu for $44 yesterday that incl. 2 different tiny miniature appetizers (fried fish & fried avocado), the entree (cut up rib eye steak pieces with fingerling potatoes) and a tiny tiny dessert (1 Mochi). 
We left hungry!
The food presentation is good, but as I said it was not much food at all. 
Not sure if I will be back..."}
{"text":"Was in town for the week and drove by this place so decided to give it a try after seeing their awesome happy hour deal. $2 off food and $3 off house wine, plus regular HH drink specials. 

The decor inside is very warm and inviting and they have a huge selection of wine lining the walls. 

The service started off great but then our waitress brought a different plate than what I ordered and other staff members kept coming up to our table and wanting to grab any plate that looked semi-empty. 

Food wise, AMAZING! We ordered the crispy Brussel sprouts, hamachi chili roll and the pork belly with beets to start and we had to order another plate of Brussel sprouts because they were so good!!!! The Brussel
Sprouts were just the right amount of crisp and the chili roll was just the right amount of spicy.  Tasted really fresh too!  Next we ordered the pork belly and kimchi tacos and the chibi burger. Both had such good flavor, the taco was a little spicy and the burger was perfectly cooked. 

I would definitely come back here (next time I'm in AZ).  Check it out for happy hour just to give it a \"test drive.\""}
{"text":"Food was great but service was terrible.  We came at 7:00 and they were already out of some vegetables.   We ordered a simple veggie roll with Avocado and serrano and the waitress made a mistake so when we told her she just brought out a plate of Serrano and said this should take care of it.   We ended up just rushing out of here but hoping other locations are not like this one"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my parents and a friend on Friday night. Roka Akor is an amazing upscale Japanese restaurant. We sat in the bar lounge area and at first had a little trouble ordering, but we eventually got help. We were in a corner so it was sometimes hard to get their attention. The waiter was extremely nice as well. When we finally got the food, it was so delicious. We had no problems with any of the dishes and were surprised at how good the restaurant was. I would say that they are above average compared to all other Arizona restaurants. The desert was delicious and very creative. Thank you!

Edit: I have came back a couple times and love this place! Best Japanese food in the valley!"}
{"text":"On a couple Groupons and a prayer I decided to try this place out.  First of all every meal is made to order, including the sushi. Also, the miso soup (which I usually hate) was quite, quite tasty. Did order the fillet cooked medium and it was very good and tender. I must say I agree with a recent YELPER that the sauce paired with the steak was not a good fit. It was overly salty for my taste (maybe that was to make up for lack of salt on meat?).

As other Yelpers have duly noted the tataki is to die for. Also, it seems the entire staff there has memorized the menu as if it were the Bible. The speaks to how well  management has trained their staff.  Since I am a sucker for excellent customer service I made sure to give R. A. a perfect YELP score. My score is really more like a ten, but there's not enough stars to do that :) 

All in all I enjoyed my visits to R.A. tremendously and will definitely be back again and refer others!

p.s. I love the fact there is a wide variety of folks there from all dressed up to jean shorts and Tishri you'll be treated the same."}
{"text":"we sat at the bar. the bartender was super nice, poured stiff, well-made drinks, and gave us good service. the other bartender who cut and chopped the big block of ice they use for their specialty drinks was also friendly and chatted with us as she sawed and hacked her way through the ice. 2 stars because of the nice folks working there.

the food? no stars. butterfish was absolutely drenched in sauce. sushi rolls were blah. the ribs were like microwaved or something.

go for the drinks and friendly bartenders. leave when you are hungry and looking for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Just finally visited the Scottsdale location even though one of our homes is so close by. I host several business meetings in the Chicago location yearly & surprisingly this place exceeded my previous experiences over there. The service was more superb than the times in Chicago and the food was spot on as always. Joel (our waiter), Luigi (the GM), Jason (in the kitchen) & the rest of the staff were ultra attentive, friendly & keen on everything. Had the pork belly, grilled octopus salad, the sweet potatoes, shishito peppers, the pork ribs, miso black cod & 2 Australian toothfish Patagonias (the special of the day), a Meyer lemon creme brûlée & many beverages... Nothing was off and the fresh Patagonias were definitely the highlight of the night. More than worth the bill for a nice night out with our 2 other close friends and my wife. Will be back."}
{"text":"Ate here with my wife for Valetine's day.  Awesome ambience, chic decor, great wait staff. Food, however, was a mix of really good and just mediocre.  We had the fixed course. Beef tataki was insane.  The ginger sauce was incredibly flavorful and complemented the rare beef well without overpowering the taste of the beef. Salmon tartare was pretty good.  Some bits of the salmon were somewhat older; had a bit of a fishy taste. Wasn't a big fan of that.  If not for that, it would have been delicious. As far as the sashimi platter went, salmon and big-eye tuna were great.  Some of the other fish weren't as fresh. Popcorn shrimp tempura was great.  Filet mignon was well cooked, however, the accompanying sauce  seemed like a cop-out to me.  It was like a duck sauce you could get from your local chinese delivery restaurant with some added spices. Sea bass was a bit undercooked in the center.  In my mind, a well cooked fish should flake, but still be moist. Ours was still raw in the center.   Dessert was OK. Chocolate ganache with green tea macaroons.  The macaroons were hard like a chip.  Could've been a bit softer.  

For the amount of money we spent ~200$ with tip for 2 drinks and dinner (granted the prices were jacked up a bit because it was valentine's day), I would've expected more attention to detail and higher quality ingredients.  

I feel like on a less busy day, some of these flaws would not have been an issue (besides the freshness of the fish).  

Definitely wouldn't rule out giving this place a 2nd chance based on its previous reviews.  Maybe we were just there on an off day."}
{"text":"I generally hate going to places that seem over hyped, so I was not really in the mood to drive 90 miles round trip to eat here.  Their website boasts \"Top 10 Sushi Spots in the United States\" by Bon Appetit. Fortunately, Roka Akor did not disappoint.

Beautiful restaurant, a positive experience started at the front door as the hostess welcomed us and acted happy to see us even though it was our first time there.  She sat us at the bar at our request as we wanted to try out the happy hour menu.  We ordered the following.  

Sweet corn tempura $4, excellent, hard to describe, just order it!

Kobe Beef and kimchi Dumplings $7.50, excellent as well and not too spicy.

Roast duck with kimchi udon $6, Great but really spicy

Butterfish Tataki with white asparagus and yuzu $9, small but full of flavor, delicious!

Also ordered a couple of standard sushi rolls that were good but unremarkable.  

Our server Shana, was top notch which made our meal even more enjoyable.  

Overall meal including cocktails $110 plus tip.  

Oh, and don't forget to check out the blocks of triple filtered glacier ice they use for specialty drinks that  sit on the bar.  Yes, I am easily entertained."}
{"text":"The bartenders are amiable. The food is outstanding. Drinks are just fantastic! We had Shishito peppers, A dozen of Oysters, Tuna Rolls & Eel rolls and all these were splendid. Very modern yet the woods make the place warm. Totally best spot for a date!"}
{"text":"It was our first time and showing up to the restaurant we were not expecting a high class restaurant. Upon arriving we waited a long time for valet to approach, which never happened, do to the type of car we arrived in. We ended up parking at the hotel near the restaurant and had to walk the rest of the way.  For the price, I was expecting the food to be significantly better. The oysters where not the best. I chewed on shells and the taste was not pleasant. The toro was good and the sushi was good. Service was not so good. They where rude to us due to the way we where dressed and they placed us in the corner of the restaurant where one entering the establishment could see us. My husband and I are very smart and I know what was implied. I make good money and we could afford it. I felt that our waiter was very nice and considerate. But entering the restaurant was nlot very welcoming."}
{"text":"I hate to admit it, but it had been a long while since my last visit to Roka Akor. I deserve a hand slap. But last week, I had the perfect excuse to pay a long overdue visit during Yelp Eats Week! We went on Friday night and to make a long story short, this is the perfect date spot and the perfect restaurant for delectable dining. But let me dive into details a bit more. 

First of all, the atmosphere here is vibrant and alive, but it lacks the \"so Scottsdale\" vibe that some similar spots may have. For this reason alone, I will become a regular at Roka Akor. There's plenty of seating inside, including seats at the bar, romantic couch seating in the lounge, front row sushi seating at the sushi bar and then plenty of normal dining all around. We sat at a normal dinner table and took in the fun environment surrounding us. 

The staff here is incredibly friendly and attentive. We arrived on time for our 8:30 dinner reservation and were seated promptly upon arrival. The server welcomed us immediately and gave a descriptive overview of the food and serving style they suggest for the restaurant. Since we were there for Yelp Eats, I definitely wanted to take advantage of some of the Yelp Eats musts, so we ordered the Grilled Sweet Corn (Roka Akor signature dish), the Skirt Steak and the Warm Toffee Cake for dessert. But, that just didn't seem like enough, so added on the rock shrimp tempura and Kobe beef and Kimchi Dumplings -- two more Roka Akor signature dishes. Since there is so much delicacy to discuss, I'll break it down by dish. 

Grilled Sweet Corn -- as sweet as it sounds. I felt like I was in a scene out of the movie Big because the corn is petite and cut into halves, so I found myself nipping away on each tiny ear. The corn was grilled perfectly and had just the right amount of zing. *** PS -- probably not the food choice for a first or second date.

Rock Shrimp Tempura -- by far my favorite dish of all and the top anywhere in the Valley. It's fried, it's tangy, it's spicy, it's crunchy, it's just delicious. I could eat an entire bowl (or two) just by myself. 

Kobe Beef Dumplings -- they were tasty and the perfect compliment to the meal. They were filling but not overly filling and with five to a plate, it's just the right amount for two. 

Skirt Steak -- I don't even know where to start. They give you a good amount of steak and it's perfectly tender, moist and delicious. We let them pick how it \"should\" be prepared and that's the right move. It was medium well and the perfect amount of rare and well done at once. The marination on it provided the perfect sweetness and it was just the right amount of steak. It's a great dish to share as well. 

Finally, the Toffee Cake -- this is a great way to end the meal with a sweet touch. Delicate and delightful. 

I almost forget about the sake. The sake here is top notch and perfect for sipping. Accompany it with a Japanese beer to sip on as well and you're in for a great evening! 

Thanks for a wonderful Friday night Roka Akor. I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we were excited to experience sushi nirvana. Didn't quite get there.  We started with the Deluxe Sashimi Platter.  Around $125, the presentation was gorgeous.  Chef's choice sashimi, it does include some of the harder to find specialities.  We also had the Grilled Pork Belly which had great flavor, but the amount of fat was too much to handle.  The crispy fried squid with chili and lime was flavorful.  Overall the flavor, atmosphere and service was good.  But that's just it.  It was merely good.  I can't complain about the taste or quality of the food, but I can't write home about it either.  I've been known to pay a lot for a meal.  This one was not worth it."}
{"text":"The most money we have ever spent on sushi.  

It wasn't filling but it was definitely rewarding.  Everything was delicious.  The butterfish appetizer, the sashimi boat, the yellowtail, and whatever else we sampled was practically melt in your mouth.

We'll be back, but not go on a completely empty stomach next time."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful, vibe is really nice, unfortunately the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the food! Not so great, best thing on the menu was the beet salad. Would def go for drinks and an appetizer then move on! Sorry Roka :/."}
{"text":"The butterfish tataki, salmon sashimi, and pork belly with Kim chi is delicious! pineapple flavored Shochu is yummy"}
{"text":"Good sushi...just an awkward location. Whenever I drive by no one is there. Wondering how they stay afloat...oh yeah it's pricey and not good enough to match the price."}
{"text":"This is a top favorite sushi/ seafood restaurant I've been to. I had come for a birthday where I had the 7 course dinner. The food was as flavorful as it was beautifully platted. By course 4, I was crying uncle because I was already full! 
I took note of this for the next time around and ordered the sea bass which was truly amazing. I'm wishing I took pictures. 
I brought some posh, hip clients with and there were NOT disappointed. They will be returning."}
{"text":"the apps brought around during a fashion week event were top notch. the butter fish sushi was amazingly delicious. the crunchy calamari with the pepper rings were simply divine. the house red and white were also extremely tasty. 

that's pretty much all we had, and if that small sampling is indicative of roka akors food menu, it is definitely a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"This review is based mainly off of their happy hour. I've visited Roka Akor twice now both for their happy hour, and to my surprise my favorite thing here is not even the sushi. It's those tiny little chibi burgers! Those things are so damn good I really like the flavor of the meat and the soft buns. I'm not even a fan of wasabi and I think the wasabi aioli works really well on the burger. Other things I've tried on the happy hour menu are: 
 1. Truffle fries- fantastic 
2. Japanese fried chicken: great flavor 
3. Prime beef and kimchi dumplings: wonderful 
4. Crispy butterfish taco-not my favorite. 

Surprisingly, I'm not really too crazy about their sushi for some reason, but the happy hour dishes will keep bringing me back. 

Also, service is really good here which I appreciate. 

Lastly, drink prices are really good on happy hour too. My beer was only 3 bucks and my wife's Cosmo was really tasty! 

Go here for the happy hour, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I didn't have much to eat here only an app., but the service and wine was amazing. 
From the Hostess, to the Manager to the Server, everyone was great! Everyone had a smile on their face and seemed to actually enjoy their job. It was a nice change from the norm in Scottsdale. The main person that stood out to me was the manager Art, he was so accommodating and went ABOVE and BEYOND to take care of me and my friend, even checked in on us from time to time. 
We went at dinner time and even tho the patio was closed, they let us sit out there for some privacy. The patio was totally covered with small openings thru the slats. GREAT PATIO! 
Art brought out some wine that rarely was opened by the glass and gave us the rest of the bottle to sample, it wasn't for me, but he was very accommodating and very helpful.  I selected some white (lighter) wine that he recommended, which was about $14 a glass, I think MoMo was the name. The server was really nice as well and when we got rained out from the patio, he brought our stuff into the bar area for us. 
I will definitely be back to have dinner, because if the food, which from the other reviews looks like it, is anything like the service. I cant wait! 
Thank you Roka Akor and Art for showing me what customer service is ALL about!!!  You have a customer in me for life!"}
{"text":"Omakase, at Roka Akor has being a seduction to the eye and indulgence to the palate. Exquisite Japanese Fine Dining in a ultra Sexy ambiance. A must to visit in Scottsdale, Arizona."}
{"text":"If I wrote a full review you'd never read it... it would be too long. We had nearly everything on the darn menu.

Everything here is between excellent to amazing, except the deserts which are so-so - more on that later.

Be warned... this place is very expensive. I would not spend my own $ here... it is at least 30% too expensive IMO compared to other places I go of this caliber. But, if you want to drop $100/person (not including drinks) and want good food... try it.

Anything cooked gets 5 stars: lamb, black cod, and about everything else is great. 

Sushi gets 3 stars: it is just OK - they do a few things that are good but nothing beyond 4 stars and that is pushing it. The fish selection is not very big so they need to step it up there is they really want to be a top place to go for just sushi.

The deserts were Meh. The only thing good was the sorbets and they were good, not great.

Overall I had a great meal, we ate a lot and the cooked dishes made the meal... good thing I did not have to pay for it."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? The whole experience was amazing! The restaurant and lounge have a relaxed contemporary feel. The service was first rate. When I first looked at the menu I was overwhelmed with choices. Our waiter could sense this and asked if he could assist in our selection. I was very impressed. He knew every item as if he spent 4 years in college getting a B.S. in Roka Akor. The manager came by several times to make sure we were taken care of. He also brought us several complimentary samples of Shochu which were heavenly.

Dinner was FABULOUS! The gin tara no saikyo-yaki (Grilled Cod) was so good it should be on the desert menu. I took one bite and I swear I almost had an orgasm. The japanese wagyu (japanese beef sirloin with chili ponzu sauce and fresh wasabi) was so tender it melted in your mouth like butter. The sushi was fresh and portions were very generous. The Sake was so smooth it went down like water.

I highly reccomend the experience. Just prepare yourself for the prices. Dinner and drinks ran us almost $400 for two! Still worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Had heard nothing great things about this place and I was not disappointed. To start our experience we had a great waiter named John (don't tell him this) and he greatly added to the whole experience. Went there with my family. 

For the appetizers, both the beef and the scallops were excellent. We tried an assortment of sushi rolls and all of them were great. I loved the black cod. Also really enjoyed the New York strip. The quality of the food was excellent. The Madagascar jumbo prawns were very good as well. For the sides I would recommend the mushrooms.  The manager was also very nice and checked in on us at least a couple of times."}
{"text":"Seeing so many 5-star reviews,I almost feel bad giving them only 3 stars, but - it has to be said ... 

This is really a 5 star / 1 star review.  The food - undoubtedly 5 star; everything everyone says about the food is correct - fresh, top of the line, well prepared, well presented.  No question.  But - there are elements to the experience that to me completely ruin it, considering the price.  

1) I call for a reservation; first a guy answers, talks to me nicely for a few minutes, then says 'let me transfer you to the hostess'; on hold listening to gibberish for a while, then; hostess asks me for my phone number ... ok, not sure why you need it but lets do it ...; \"first name\" ... ok, I guess you want that too; \"last name\" ... wtf, this is getting annoying ... but I give it anyway ... \"can you spell that please\" ...OMG ... if you have my phone number, and my first name, why do you need my last name?! ... and spelled out ... ?! It's a restaurant reservation, not an airline reservation! 

2) We sit at the 'robato/sushi' bar.  Great view, watch all the action. Couldn't be better, except - there's an icy cold wind blowing down from the vents. Now, this is January - about 45 degrees outside. Thank goodness I was wearing a jacket and scarf, because I needed it - though I like to take off such things once I get inside.. I live in Phoenix because I LIKE THE WARMTH ... I don't want to be frozen to death while I eat (this is one of my pet peeves with many places in Phoenix ... it's as if they setup their A/C in July and just leave it on all through the winter ... either that or, the wait-staff and kitchen staff control the A/C and since they are running around being busy, they like the temp to be cold ... but we patrons are sitting idly, not exactly overheating! A new couple arrived and sat at my side, and asked 'is this cold to you?' - so this wasn't just me. 

3) I was in the middle of an interesting conversation with my partner, when I heard \"pardon the interruption; may I take your plate?\".  The girl was a cute blonde, typical Scottsdale material.  If I'm in the middle of a conversation, I'm obviously busy, and being interrupted for the matter of a plate removal is just ... bad service.  If they are delivering hot, fresh, food, then of course interrupt me, but ... removal of empty plate? This, to me, smacks of lack of training ... any 'quality' server knows that you don't interrupt for no good reason.  We also had a few 'pardon my reach' comments, when they reached over to pour my beer. Now, if they want to avoid reaching, they could pour the beer on the serving tray, THEN reach over briefly to place on the table, but ... instead they place the empty glass on the table then lean over and pour for what seems like an age ... 

Again, food was fanstastic but these things detract from the overall experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Did a search for top sushi restaurants in Scottsdale and this one popped up.  Out of the 5 days vacationing here...we have eaten here twice!  
For the most part, we chose items from the menu that were in red, indicating a Roka Akor specialty:
Butterfish Tataki - scrumptious! 
Roka Akor Scallops - perfectly mastered
Roka Akor Yuzu Miso Marinated Black Cod with Pickled Red Onions - melts in your mouth!
Roka Akor Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll - my new favorite sushi roll ever
Veggies - the mushrooms and corn are very tasty!  The veggies don't seem too healthy with all the yummy sauces/spices, but do recommend them!
Loved the saki that we ordered, but cannot remember which kind it was.  
We sat at the robata on our first visit, which was plenty roomy and we got to watch all the food come out.  Our second visit we ate at the bar; which was equally enjoyable.  I don't find the dining room that appealing, so it's nice to have other options.  
The food is not just tasty, but very fresh and the presentation is wonderful. 
This is now our favorite sushi/Japanese restaurant!!!!  We need one in Florida...the Scottsdale location is the only one in the U.S."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was AMAZING!! The food, the sakes, the service, and the ambiance exceeded my expectations. We decided to do the tasting menu and had it paired with sakes. The chef came to our table and asked if there were any restrictions. From there on out the food and sakes started flowing. Jason was the chef and Wes was our waiter. They both took very good care of us, but everyone on the restaurant staff was very friendly. I will definitely be back on my next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is simply one of the best Japanese meals you'll have. The super high quality of the food is a notch above even good Japanese restaurants. Everything from the sushi, to the tempura to the ribeye steak were some of the best we have had. My wife head 5 different vegetable side dishes that were so flavorful, grilled and prepared to perfection. The restaurant is very lively and can be too loud in the evening but the atmosphere is fun, energetic and chic. This place is a winner."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, and both the food & service are amazing.  For my birthday, they gave us a private room.  We didn't even ask for it!  The food is great.  The decor and ambiance is really great to bring a date, or just spend time with friends.  This place is always one of my go-to restaurants!  One of the best restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience from start to finish. Food was delicious, the server was knowledgable and friendly. The panna cotta dessert is to die for. Im very picky when it comes to dining but I could not find one little thing that I didn't like about this place."}
{"text":"Finally Finally went after all these years and all the hype.
Met some friends for happy hour.  The pros:  Cheap beer.  Beer is 2 for 1, which amounts to 2.50 cents per Asahi.  Having said that, ate off the happy hour menu. Perhaps the dinner menu is better, but the happy hour menu sounded delicious so we sat in the lounge.
The lounge is pretty, good view of this wine wall (which is where they hide the very pretty bathrooms).  The staff is pretty, some are very nice, others a bit cold.
The menu had all sorts of exciting sounding appetizers.  Kobe beef gyoza, (fatty tasting but not in a great way, tasted like the filling in an okay egg-roll), soft shell crab buns, good, but not for the price.  The kimchee noodles with duck breast were passable, but nothing to write home about.  Was told that the scallop sushi roll was \"the best roll\" that the restaurant makes.  It was....okay.  Had edmame, had the pork belly.  Most everythign on the menu, both salty and not involved ponzu sauce. I love ponzu but it seemed to be in everything.  The seafood salad was a good mix of sashimi peices, but microscopic in size. Ordered desserts, pretty presentation, but nothing spectacular.  The one dish I really liked was the butterfish tataki with ponzu sauce.  Problem is, we were served five nearly transparent (as in small) pieces of fish about the size of two postage stamps apiece.  Tasty but dissapointingly small.  The bill for four folks (who didn't eat all that much and barely drank the happy hour beer) was about 175.00
I don't mind spending money when its tasty, (for a better place with a more intimate feel, stop by Teeter House downtown, better food, better preparation.   The bill pained me as the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"We went here while visiting from the Chicagoland area, with a group of 8 to celebrate a birthday. My husband and I, as well as 2 others, are avid sushi eaters back at home. We were recommended to this restaurant by a few different people. The sushi was good, however not as tasty as I've had at sushi restaurants at home. We tried an array of sides as well, including corn, asparagus, and bbq rice, however only the asparagus was really delicious. Steaks were also good, however portions were very small compared to what we've received at sushi restaurants at home. Just didn't feel the cost was worth the food. (We pay the same prices at other restaurants, and feel it's more worth it)"}
{"text":"Server was excellent but the time it took for drinks to come out was very slow.  Sushi was very very good. We had eaten also at the one in Chicago and It is way to loud inside.  We like a fun environment but yelling with friends sitting next to you not good.  Sitting outside is best. Other food on the menu was only fair."}
{"text":"Oh Roka Akor. How much I love thee. I so look forward to dine here very often. I love your steaks. They put all those pretentious steakhouses to shame. They  are delicious and does not leave you with a full and heavy feeling. Also the black Cod is on par with Nobu. Pork Belly, Dumplings, cremini mushrooms. The list goes on and on. It's Japanese Fusion to me. Cudo's to John, a waiter and really the whole staff. Fairly expensive, but well worth it."}
{"text":"We went on a Fri night for our anniversary, the food was incredible, you HAVE to try the pork belly app, literally the best I've ever tasted. We tried the butterfish and a few other starters, all were delish. The nigiri and maki rolls were also excellent. My husband and I shared the black cod entre and brocolini side and we were blown away! Everything was perfect, the service was impeccable. It's a pricey place, but I felt it was worth it. They even treated us to a champagne toast, dessert and a card to celebrate. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here looking for a sushi place, and this had a great reputation for it. To clarify for others, I really wouldn't call this place a sushi restaurant. They have some sushi options, but far more space on the menu is dedicated to cooked fish, grilled veggies, and beef. 

Maybe my credibility is stunted by the fact that after having a baby, date nights stopped for a solid two years, and this was one of the first places we went once we had a chance to resume date nights... would I rave about any restaurant after two years of fighting a baby/toddler to take one more bite each night?

But I counter my self-doubt with the fact that I travel extensively for work, and usually visit a new city's mid-upper-tier restaurants at least one time per trip, so I am lucky enough to know excellent food. Having been a restaurant server for 11 years, I particularly appreciate good service...

Five stars for all of the above. Happy Hour is one of the best deals in Arizona, and although you might assume that's for the booze, my pregnant wife agrees. It's the food! You can get a huge array of small plates from the happy hour menu, a few at a time, and still make it out the door completely satisfied for $60 including a cocktail or two. To indulge on a signature entree in addition, you are still under $100. 

They shave ice for cocktails from a huge block (it's just as cold as ice cubes, but somehow cooler that way) - and they use real lime juice in a gimlet, which is hard to find. The Robata-grilled items are delicious and at least seem healthy... the (cooked) black cod is the best fish I have ever eaten, and the toro flight is a really fun way to sample the different cuts of that expensive sushi. Even things that are normally unimpressive are delicious here - Brussels sprouts, sliders, broccolini...

With a menu like theirs, it helps to have an expert help navigate it for you - a server who can help guide your experience really takes it to the next level. Some restaurants are starting to replace servers with ipads at the table - they're just order takers, after all. Not here. If you go, ask for Victoria. She knows the menu inside and out, and having been a few times, we never get the feeling that she has a canned speech she repeats to every table. She tries to recommend things you like based on your other selections. 

I would highly recommend this place for a date night, a semi-casual business dinner, or a group of friends. Although in a pinch I might bring kids, it wouldn't be my first choice for that age group.

This is our go-to date night spot now. After dropping $300 (for two) at Mastro's and being impressed but not wowed, I would rather come here 2-4 times and be wowed each time, for the same price."}
{"text":"Food should be an art form and at Roka Akura it is. Our party of 5 sampled a variety of sushi and Japanese steaks. Service and food is outstanding. If you travel the world you will be hard pressed to find anything better than the experience offered here. Note this place is quite pricey. Great food but you pay for it"}
{"text":"A local friend recommended us to try this place and said it had good sushi. We'd good sushi there but it wasn't anything you cannot get from Ra Sushi or any other spots in Scottsdale. The price was 2x the other sushi spots. Furthermore the portions were really small too. The decor was nice and trendy but we didn't see any trendy people there on a Saturday night. The only plus was the wine and mixed cocktails."}
{"text":"Roka Akor Scottsdale is an extension of the celebrated Roka in London.
I attended the opening night and a follow up for lunch the following day. Overall, I was impressed with the offerings of fresh sushi, and robata grilled tidbits. The dish that really won me over was crab hot pot and the creamy rice was absolutely zoftik.
I drank many fresh sochu  infused cocktails, and crushed three bottles of sake with skilled Kikisake-shi, Sayaka Watanabe. This Japanese sake sommelier is London-based and the zuma-roka group sake trainer. They do have a fantastic sake selection. Easily the best in Scottsdale. She loved my sake brand I created with Midorikawa called Green River, and my low alcohol brand sake, Koide, as well.
They also have a great Italian Sommelier named Alessandro Marchesan, who is also based out of London. Too bad they are only loaner personnel from HQ in London.
The room is clean and beautiful with post modern Asian inspired lines. The staff is eager and young, but quite unskilled in refined service.  I am sure that will be a long cycle for the Roka management to fix. I have a dear friend who dined there on her birthday. She told me the service was \"shockingly bad.\" She then reiterated that is was,  \"so bad that it was entertainingly bad!\" The food great and hopefully the service will match soon. Kanpai, Roka..kudos on your sake program."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!  A must do in Scottsdale/Phoenix.  The food was exquisite, every dish was delicate and delicious.  The chefs know their food.  Everything was very good.

Two of us enjoyed the \"Omakase\", a chef's selection of dishes for the evening.  We got to try several dishes, from a huge sashimi platter to a stunning wagyu beef preparation.  It was a great way to try many different things on the menu.  And ended in a fresh and flavorful dessert tray!

The service was also just as wonderful.  Sarah took great care of us, and was knowledgeable and friendly. She made the night delightful.

If you are looking for a true culinary adventure you must try Roka."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Ordered the asparagus from the grill, BBQ rice, spicy avocado roll and spicy prawn roll. Everything was fabulous. Unagi roll was ok. Wonderful atmosphere and great service."}

Want to but I can Yelp it, I love the way it tastes
Just got my drinks and getting ready for what is my meal
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop by every day knowing that I will

If you're really hungry and I 
know what to do about it
Even if you're not I know I am, and I wouldn't doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it

And I know this much is true
Roka, you have become my addiction
I'm so hungry for you, I can barely move
But I like it and it's at Roka Akor

(at Roka Akor)
And it's at Roka Akor

Hearth of Fire?

Roka Akor is a Robatayaki Japanese restaurant located in the middle of Scottsdale.  Not too north and not too south; off Scottsdale Road and Indian Bend. 

The word ROKA is actually two words from the Japanese language.  RO meaning hearth and KA meaning fire.  Robatayaki is a traditional Japanese barbarque concept, where food is cooked in front of customers and served.

Okay, enough with the educational part.  Let's get to the fun part.  Eating & drinking!  What can I say, or should I sing?

Les poisson les poisson how I love les poisson
Love to chop and to serve little fish
(Chef Louis from The Little Mermaid)

I always order from the Bar where they have offer the small plates.  Their Sake and Shochu Lounge menu is a must and very affordable.  My favorite, the fishys'!  Their Butterfish Tataki with white Asparagus and Yuzu is mmm good; yes chopped little poisson in my belly - Yum!  The fish itself is soft and melts in your mouth and the asparagus adds the crunch you need to balance out the texture.  The Yuzu sauce is sweet and sour.  Other favorites I must mention is the Chibi Burger, Sweet Corn Tempura, and Roast Duck with Kimchi Udon. Finally, the star of the night has to be the Mushroom Hot Pot --- Uhh! I'm not a vegan by any means, but if I get to eat this daily I'll consider it! A combination of 3 mushrooms and soft sticky rice served in a stone pot; the aroma of the mushrooms cover the rice, while providing a sweet warm creamy blanket to your palates. Yummy!

By the way, do you need to impress a date?  Well look no further!  Roka Akor will definitely wow your significant other!   The place itself is eye candy!  Sweet in my belly and sweet for my eyes; can't complain.  Presentations of the dishes are no laughing matter either.  I think I enjoy taking pictures of the food here more then most places.  Overall, a must visit for happy hour or to tell your date you're serious and you play with the big boys of the food world. - Enjoy!

{"text":"Roka Akor has nice ambiance and service, but overall it didn't measure up to the hype. While it may not be fair to compare Roka Akor to fine dining in places like the Bay Area, it's hard not to when the price points are similar. My favorite of the night presented itself as an unsuspecting baked potato.

Parking is in the rear and was pretty plentiful on a weekday evening. The restaurant was semi-full around 7pm and become more full as the night went on. There was no hostess at the front for about five minutes when I first walked in, and though our server was amicable and charismatic, he was also absent for most of the meal. The decor boasts of an open kitchen with modern tables and chairs, but the chairs are a bit worn. The lighting is dimmed to be intimate, but the filtered out red light was a bit strange (hence the interesting coloration of my pictures).

Sashimi and nigiri:
Uni nigiri was delicious, super buttery and fresh with just the right amount of sushi rice on the bottom. Impeccably made, it definitely lived up to its (pretty reasonable) price point. The special of the day was young yellowtail, which could be served either nigiri style or sashimi style. I opted for the sashimi and found the fish to be fresh, but perhaps not my favorite because of how lean it was. It tasted like halibut that had been trimmed super close to the bone, and the sinewy texture wasn't my favorite.

Seared scallop roll:
This roll was okay. I could tell the scallop on top was fresh, but it was certainly sparse and barely seared. The rest of the roll was unremarkable.

New York Steak:
I liked that this steak came sliced, which meant that it was cooked, rested, and then sliced. New York strip is pretty lean, and I found that it was just slightly done past the medium rare mark. This dish came served with a very creamy wasabi mayo that I could have done without. It was a nice steak, but not worth the asking price in my opinion.

Baked potato:
When my date ordered the baked potato, I made fun of him for it because.. it's a baked potato. Ordered separately. At an upscale restaurant. That cost $10. But when the baked potato came, it was sliced down the middle and elegantly presented on a stone slab with two sauces. The bake was perfect -- absolutely perfect. The inside was tender yet soft, super fluffy but still retained some moisture from the steaming. Someone paid a lot of attention to that potato, and now I wasn't laughing anymore because I wished I'd ordered one of my own. 

Ube pot de creme:
This was a lovely idea for a dessert, and I think if the execution could be tweaked a little, it'd be divine. I wasn't a fan of the presentation, as it was set in a regular bowl with some fruit on top (albeit very skillfully cut fruit). The pot de creme was very creamy, but there was too much gelatin used to set it so that it didn't have any airiness to it. Dense cream should be saved for ice cream. The ube flavor was there, but I sure wanted more of it. The freshly baked cookie crisps on top were stellar though -- I could eat a bag of those. 

Overall I am glad I was able to experience Roka Akor, but I'd hesitate coming back."}
{"text":"What can I say that the 277 other people haven't already said? 

The food is extremely fresh, imaginative and delicious.

The service is quick and friendly. 

The drinks are cold, tasty and abundant in variety.

The happy hour is awesome! 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great dinner last night. We ended up being there for three hours! 

Arrived a bit earlier than reservation, we started with our drink at the bar. I like the way they decorated the bar. Nice display of so many different kind of shotsyu, great wine selection, comfy chairs, and they even had a DJ last night.

We started our dinner with deluxe sashimi plate. First seafood I put in my mouth was uni (sea urchin). As soon as I put it in my mouth, it melted in my mouth, so good. I was really happy with the quality of uni they served. I like their fresh wasabi where they grind real fresh wasabi roots. I also like their rock salt. Some fish goes good with salt better than soy sauce with wasabi. I ate some sashimi with just fresh wasabi without soy sauce. Their wasabi is so good, it has great flavor without too much of spice.  Toro (fatty tuna) was also good as well. Good toro melts in my mouth so good, I like the texture and flavor of toro.  Oysters had a bit too much citrus flavoring for my taste. I prefer real oysters taste without any added flavor.

Nigiri and rolls we had were also good as well. I like the way they flavored scallops. Hamachi sushi I had, I was pleased with the quality of hamachi.

We finished dinner with kabocha pumpkin cheesecake. This cheesecake was't too sweet, just right amount of sweetness mixed with ice cream and cranberry sauce. Nuts on the cheesecake was just a little overwhelming, it didn't compliment the kabocha .

Service was excellent. Besides our waitress, they had enough staff always walking around to clear empty plates and refill our drink.

Bathroom stool's door came all the way down, completely enclosed the toilet. The shape of toilet was not standard US. They were similar to what I've seen in Singapore. Bathroom was clean but I thought they could use something more, perhaps some nice aroma oils.  

Overall I really enjoyed the night, great quality food, nice ambiance, good service. I definitely want to come back again for another great meals."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went a couple of days ago for lunch.  We were using a groupon.  I ordered the \"teriyaki\" salmon and my daughter had the spicy tuna roll.

I must admit, I've had better at a MUCH cheaper price!!  The salmon was grilled farm salmon, very bland, and on the side was a dish of what appeared to be bottled commercial teriyaki sauce.  It was very thick and ho hum.

My daughter's sushi was nothing special.  

The service was great.  I think the only thing we were paying for was the beautiful bathroom!"}
{"text":"I would have to say the best happy hour in Scottsdale. Diverse menu, great prices, and great bartender, Chris. You gotta try the Chibi burger, a slider sized burger that is big in flavor. If this burger came in a whopper size, I would order two of them. The apps like the sweet corn tempura and the butterfish tataki are win wins also. Not to mention, all of the grilled Robata. If I could go there every day for happy hour I would."}
{"text":"Wonderful selection. Beautiful and chic decor. Perfect service. Loved the rolls, poke  and steak. Oh and those exotic brussels!!!! Yum."}
{"text":"The food was great, food server was really nice and knowledgable, bartender was nice, but the hostess was unbelievably rude. Terrible attitude and anything but hospitable, we felt like we were imposing.  She really needs training for customer service skills, get over yourself!"}
{"text":"I don't mind at all paying over 200$ for dinner, but i think it's reasonable to expect that the food be something splendid in every bite. Truth is 70% of the food was only so so and the accompanying price tag just made it seem like a total let down. 
Good stuff: lemon drop martini=yummy and only 9$!!
Veggie sides from the robata bar menu= abundant and quite tasty..although nothing to write home about per say. 

Bad stuff:
All the boring overpriced sushi. 
The chirashi roll is a huge let down, for 19$ you'd think they could throw some salmon on it instead of butterfish?! Butterfish with skin on trimmings are not tasty, its like bycatch,  yuk. I scraped it off. 
The scallop dynamite roll is another 19$ let down, it's really just a california roll with some paper thin scallop on top, you can't taste it, plus a micro dot of mayo, it might as well not be there. 
It wasn't just subpar it was subboring.
.... and thats all folks."}
{"text":"I just experienced lunch at Roka last week. We walked in and no one else was there dining. The host/server seemed a little confused and we asked about lunch, and he somehow 'got it'.. haha. 

Only the lounge area was open [I've never been during dinner, anyone want to take me?! Ha!], real nice and quiet, an oasis from the hustle-and-bustle of bright Scottsdale in the early afternoon. I had the passion fruit-mango iced tea and boy was that pretty! Pretty impressive for a typically-basic beverage. 

We came in with a sushi craving [I love my little baby, always wanting the good stuff] and were disappointed to see only three different kinds and a sashimi bowl available. I honestly was thinking of gorging on 5 different rolls and that was that, but I was thrown a curve ball. We decided on the avocado maki, the avocado-yellowtail maki, and a field greens salad and miso soup. 

I got over my inability to be a glutton, and I started to feel at peace with everything. No need to get pregzilla right? I did have to hit American Apparel afterward anyway, and with those slim cuts, I'd be shooting myself in the foot if I ate a huge meal when needing to check out swimsuits.. Anyway. The waiter was cute [and he smelled SO GOOD... thanks, hormones] and friendly, and was really good about refilling drinks and bringing our lunch promptly. Before we knew it, we were faced with a slew of healthy vittles and I was a happy camper. Everything was awesome, and satisfying, but not super filling. Perfect. The way Americans should eat."}
{"text":"Great food.  Everything we tried was amazing, starting with the braised pork belly that dare I say was...unctuous?  The word sounds almost dirty and is way overused, but I think it belongs here.  The dish was fatty and flavorful, and gone all too quickly.  We washed this down with Yuzu, which was an enlightening and delicious drink discovery.  It's absolutely fantastic stuff - every time you sip it down halfway, just add some water and it's like you have a a whole new drink again.  The stuff is freakin magic and cannot be diluted!

For entrées I got an 8 oz. filet and the wife got lamb chops.  Both were perfectly seared medium rare with a melt in your mouth buttery texture.  The filet's dipping sauce was a bit too strong, so use sparingly lest you hide that beautiful beefy flavor.

To finish, we ordered the almond torte with lemon buttermilk ice cream.  It was a random selection, and we definitely don't regret it.  Using yet another overused food word, the dessert was decadent and the odd ice cream flavor meshed perfectly with the sweet pastry underneath.  There was some tasty white goo and a fruity drizzle as well.  Don't embarrass yourself, this place is too upper crust for licking the plate.

So for negatives - I wasn't particularly impressed with the 'Honor and Glory\" cocktail that I ordered.  It's my own fault though for ignoring grapefruit in the ingredients list - I should have known it wouldn't be subtle.  Also, be prepared for a long evening - service was agonizingly slow and I'm pretty sure it's intentional since the place wasn't busy and every other table seemed to be lingering in the restaurant indefinitely.  I think we were meant to savor our meal slowly and pine away the evening like rich, retirees.  Unfortunately, I'm a bit uncultured and the pace didn't jive with my Hoover style food inhalation.  I cast many longing looks at the waiter, who to his credit was quite friendly and at least kept us watered.  Finally, this place is at the upper end of a $$$ rating, though I think the quality of our meal merited the splurge."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for dinner and decided to check out their new lunch menu.

Roka Akor is all about quality.  Quality decor, quality ingredients, quality preparation and quality service.

I ordered their Beef Donburi lunch which came with miso soup and a small salad.  I thought the white miso soup was very flavorful and fragrant while not as salty as most misos.

The beef donburi was a rice dish with plenty of juicy steak and sprouts on top. The light sauce really brought it all together.  Between the soup, salad and main dish I had plenty of food for $13.50.

I also had a mango hibiscus tea which was not too sweet and was constantly refilled without having to ask by the attentive server at the bar.

It's nice to have a lunch of this quality without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar saturday, talked with Dave and Alex. Had a good time, they definitely knew their stuff. Had some happy hour menu drinks as well as some food. I will definitely be back because of how good the combination of the staff and food were."}
{"text":"My one star review is not based on the food as we left before we ordered as the service was so bad.  Went in yesterday to check out the happy hour as we had a few hours to kill before we headed over to a concert.  

Sat at the bar and waited for the bartender to come over and say hello, she was talking with the other couple at the end of the bar about someone that was in earlier that she had an issue with, not sure if it was a customer or co-worker but whatever it was she completely ignored us.  Mind you, there are only 4 of us in the entire bar/lounge area, not like you couldn't miss us.  She finally came over, gave us water and walked away.  After a few minutes I finally motioned to her that we actually would like something, ordered a Tito's and Wine and kept looking at the menu.  I was planning on spending a lot of money there as we don't get out often anymore but told my wife that we should leave and go somewhere else.  You would think during the summer a bartender would be thrilled to have someone come sit at the bar as these restaurants are dead this time of the year, hence why they are now doing a Groupon.

Finished our drinks, she came over and asked if we were ready to order and I just asked for my check.  Drove down the road to Binks, had a great dinner, and had a great conversation with the bartender that was friendly and had a personality."}
{"text":"Try Roka's trendy happy hour! Get there at 4:30 when HH starts, grab a nice sofa or even pre-reserve a HH table, order a $7 Mango Shochu (Honey is ok, a little strong) to get the free Yelp Check-In dessert brownie and settle in. The wait staff is a little slow to take your order, but the amazing food makes up for it. Once you order, food is delivered and empty plates removed very professionally. Munch on Steamed Edamame with Sea Salt $2.5 and Crispy Fried Squid Sweet Corn Tempura $4 while you check out the HH menu. Recommend the following: \"Chibi\" Burger (3oz) Prime Beef with Wasabi Aioli $3 and Cremini Mushroom Burger with Wasabi Aioli $3, and the yummy Soft Shell Crab Sandwich with Avocado $5. Try a Roka Akor Taco: Scallop and Seafood Ceviche $4 is ok, but definitely get the Pork Belly and House-Made Kimchi Taco for $4 instead. Skip the Crispy Fried Brussels Sprouts - too salty! Opt for the famed Butterfish Tataki with White Asparagus and Yuzu $9, but my fav is the heavenly Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll $10! Drinks and all this food for two with a nice tip well for around $75!!!!  (Shokuyoku!) http://rokaakor.com/mobi/scottsdale-menu.html"}
{"text":"I wish I could give half-stars, because I would give Roka Akor 3.5 stars if I could... I came here about a month ago for my birthday with 6 or 7 other people. 

The fish was excellent--some of the freshest I've had, and I grew up in a sushi restaurant. Yes, I literally spent the majority of my childhood and adolescent years IN a sushi restaurant (my parents owned one for 15 years in Colorado, and they didn't believe in babysitters). The yellowtail was to die for! We also tried a bunch of rolls, which were decent, but the only really memorable one for me was the hamachi serrano chili roll. My only complaint about the rolls were that they were so TINY! For $12 a pop I expect more than just a sliver of fish inside my roll. If I ever come back I'll probably stick to the nigiri and sashimi. I can't say much for the cooked food and tempura because I didn't really try any...

The reason for only 3 stars? The service SUCKED. I work in a damn sports bar serving drunks burgers and chicken wings all day and I could have given better service! Our server did NOT know how to multitask at all--he'd ask one person at the table if they needed another drink, leave to go get said drink (which would take 10-15 mins), come back to drop it off, then ask the next person if they needed another drink. Repeat with the next person and so on--by the time he finally gets around to you, you've been waiting 30+ minutes for another cocktail. Maybe he didn't have the mental capacity to take more than one person's drink order at a time--who knows, but with how much we're paying, I expect good service!


UPDATE (2/25/2010): 
So, the GM contacted me thru Yelp to address the service problems I had that night. That says a lot to me--this restaurant obviously has a large, loyal following, and it (pleasantly) surprised me that he took time out of his day to contact me to apologize about the poor service I received. So many restaurant owners have the \"Well if you don't like it, you can piss off and just go someplace else\" attitude, and it's very refreshing that Roka is not one of these places. I can't wait to go back soon to try it again, hopefully I can come back and give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"went tonight, we had sushi only which was excellent.  Had tuna flight, Hamhhhhhhhachi serrano roll, snapper, salmon, and then a spicy tuna roll.  Tuna flight was expensive, but awesome.  Service was good, fresh wasabi, and some fresh ground salt which actually worked."}
{"text":"This past Saturday was my second visit to Roka Akor, first time with my husband, second with my sister. Both times we had exceptional service and food. 

First time we had the tasting menu and while I don't remember much of what we ate (it was a lot!), I do remember everything was delicious.

My sister is visiting and she loves sushi so I knew she had to try Roka. We ordered the scallops appetizer, a salmon roll, unagi roll, sweet corn, mushrooms, BBQ crispy rice, teriyaki chicken and black cod. Everything was absolutely amazing! The flavors, the presentation, the aroma. The salmon roll was ridiculously good, a nice piece of salmon atop the roll, fresh and melting in your mouth. We barely even talked while eating because we wanted to enjoy the food:) 
My sister doesn't like fish (only raw) and I had to keep her away from my black cod!
 
Oh! And the drinks are amazing too! It is pricey but very much worth it"}
{"text":"Valentines warning!
We went here previously and while the quality of the food was above average the amount you get is dismally disappointing. The servers are trained to present the menu as if it's the price for 2 and make it very confusing when they present you with a $250 check. I would guess the food cost vs profit is wildly off balance as Roka takes advantage of this special occasion holiday.."}
{"text":"I would recommend getting items from the grill! We liked the pork belly and sweet potatoes and wish we got more from the grill, but the butterfish tataki is really good also!"}
{"text":"What a night. What a night! After one of the most horrible weeks in my history I wanted to cheer myself up with some amazing food and drinks. A foodie friend recommended that I try this place. Well BIG thank you to him because I will be back. 

First I walked in thinking happy hour and the bar would be the best place to perk up a smile. Thanks to the friendly hostess she got me the best table in house in the dinning room. 

Second my waitress greeted me pretty much seconds after I sat down. Alyee was amazing from her recommendation to our conversation though out my meal. 

Third the food. Now this is normally where I would be picky in a review but tonight I was trying to pick the food apart in hopes of one day creating the dishes at home. I had the kale caesar, miso soup, and Skuna Bay Salmon. All were plated and prepared perfectly.  

Cant wait for my next cheer me up trip into Roka Akor!"}
{"text":"Super fun, hip environment with very good sushi.

I like the spin they put on the sushi experience with having an open-flame grill.  This Roka Akor has a much better energy than the one I visited in downtown Chicago.  The scene is vibrant, the servers super friendly and tattooed, and the sushi chefs all are hipsters except the quintessential serious Japanese guy forming the nigiri.  I'm a sushi snob and a perfectionist, so quite hard to please, but they did a good job.  I tried a wide selection of items; here's a rundown:

1) Edamame - very good, I liked the shaved sea salt.  This was a sign that Roka is about adding that extra touch to the presentation

2) Sashimi Deluxe Platter - this is a big-spend item, and a lot of fish.  Some of the cuts are premium, others are specials of the day.  The presentation is grand, however, I did not like that they serve all this on ice.  I'm not sure why so many restaurants do this, as it makes the fish too cold which reduces their taste.  It is served with freshly ground wasabi and sliced ginger.

Here's a synopsis of this hefty platter starting from the bottom (if you reference the photos):
- Oysters - served with chile and a ponzu sauce, reminds me of Morimoto but less delicate
- Toro tartar - excellent, loved this mixed with some scallion.  It was like a negitoro roll sans the rice and nori
- 5 types of white fish - hamachi was good, three-line grunt was interesting, some were not cut as expertly as I would have preferred, a bit floppy
- Akami and maguro - two types of tuna, the pieces were massive and too much fish per mouthful
- O-toro and chu-toro - o-toro was a bit greasy and not as sophisticated as I'd like being from Spain not Japan, the chu-toro, however, was standout, in that it combined a succulent fatty taste with a bit more texture

3) Robata mushrooms - cremini mushrooms.  Not much to say here except the skewer concept is fun, and I think next time I'll opt for more skewered items, such as waygu beef if available!

4) Salmon sashimi - I wanted to try some more sashimi, the salmon had a nice light texture

5) Nigiri flight - Ikura was very fresh, each fish egg was perfectly formed and not frozen or desiccated.  Uni was from santa barbara and oh so sweet.  I was so happy they had this.  The nori (seaweed paper) was a bit plain and not toasted.  It seemed as though they had picked it up at the local Whole Foods, but I could be wrong.  Shari (rice) was slightly above room temperature and had a touch of vinegar to it.  I liked it.  Oh, and the Unagi.  Unfortunately, for a grilling restaurant, I think they became a little overzealous and charred my poor freshwater eel.  Don't worry, I ate them up anyway

6) Amaebi with fried heads - I wanted to end on a sweet note, so went with sweet shrimp.  The amaebi were extremely fresh and cracked open in front of me (alas, they were not alive at the time).  As an extra decadent touch they deep fried the heads, which, despite being a health nut, I savored.  There's something about the warmth and crispness of the heads, and still they retain a granule of that sweet flavor which makes amaebi so fun

All in all, a very good experience.  The GM was accommodating and made me feel welcome, and the sushi chefs, while not garrulous, were happy to smile and nod.  I would've preferred a bit more information on the provenance of each fish and what made each item special, however,  this is a good place to unwind with a drink, throw down some sushi, and sample savory grilled items"}
{"text":"Love this place, it's uber chic, however I was a little disappointed to see they took drinks off of the after-5 happy hour offerings. The bill rose very quickly as we celebrated my friend's Happy 30-something birthday. Mind you, there were about 35-40 of us there...Nevertheless, the happy hour menu is delicious, and I always have a wonderful time there. I had to take a star away because of the drink thingy. OUCH! Next time I'll have to make it a 'Pleasant Hour' instead of a 'Happy Hour'. ;)"}
{"text":"On a return ini vacation to Phoenix this year, we did not pass up the opportunity to go back to Roka Akor for Happy Hour.

An early dinner or a meal between meals, there is a reason why we call it Happy Hour. The best ones have the best deals and dishes. We are lovers of small plates and great drinks. 

I already knew that we would order the Hamachi Serrano Chile Roll and the Butterfish Tatake, those were absolutely the reasons why we returned. In addition we ordered the Scallop Ceviche Taco and the Pork Belly Taco, really great.

To drink, I ordered the Soju again. I love infused Soju and the flavors this time were a little different. We also went for the Kirin on HH special. 

To make things that much sweeter, check in and get a free spice cake. It was delicious and a bonus for choosing Roka Akor."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd review of this fabulous restaurant!  I'll admit that going out to dinner on Valentine's Day fills me with angst. Restaurants are overcrowded, service isn't up to par and the food is normally not as good as it usually is. So, as much as we loved Roka Akor the last time, I was scared to tarnish that memory. 

I can joyfully say that it was a fabulous night and the food and service did not disappoint!  We had the fixed price 7 course dinner and every single bite was FABULOUS! ! I could rave on and on about all of it, but our absolute favorite was the A5-9+ Japanese Wagyu Striploin. We ordered it med - rare and it melted in our mouthes! It was served with the Japanese Wild Mushroom Hotpot w/ Fresh Truffle - sooooo delicious! The Chilean Sea Bass with Yozu Truffle Butter & Salmon Roe was piping hot and cooked to perfection. Hard to do in large quantities. The Grilled Asparagus w/ Wafu Dressing & Sesame was also just right. I hate soggy or overcooked veggies, but these were perfect - tender, yet crisp.

It was especially nice to see our server working so hard at keeping everyone happy. He could have easily been flustered by the enormous crowd, but he was so attentive, even having time to joke around a bit while doing a phenomenal job! Kudos to the chef, kitchen staff, wait staff and management for giving us the best meal we've ever had on Valentine's Day!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The sushi was very fresh and full of flavor. The best sushi we have ever had. The lamb was very tender, a bit over cooked but still delicious. This is a great place to dine out and have fun."}

{"text":"Another big thanks to Yelp & Groupon, which both lead us to Roka Akor for an early dinner last week. 

First off, the service was impeccable. The entire menu was explained perfectly & there was never a minute our waters were even close to being empty. 

Secondly, the food. The grilled pork belly is a fabulous starter. The dynamite scallop roll is hands-down the best sushi roll I've ever had in my life.  The yuzu miso marinated black cod was a fantastic piece of fish with great flavor. Essentially, we ordered everything marked with the 'Roka Akor' signature and didn't have one bite that wasn't delicious.

Pretty pricey, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"I have been enamored by Roka Akor since the first time I dined there 5 years ago. One of my favorite places for happy hour or a nice night out. Not pictured but I ALWAYS get the Calamari, I just don't feel complete without it! This time we tried a bunch of new things including the Seared Scallop Roll and Alaskan King Crab which were to die for. The Cremini Mushrooms with Soy Garlic Butter are another go to and if you like rice definitely try to Mushroom Hot Pot. Happy hour drinks are good and relatively cheap. Honestly Roka Akor doesn't have the best desserts but the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Blondie was decent. As always I am impressed by this restaurant and I will obviously be back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Found Roka Akor while browsing thorugh Open Table & based on the reviews in Yelp & OpenTable I could not understand how I could miss this restaurant...perhaps I need to change how I restaurant search throught the multiple internet sites. Whatever...
Let's get this out of the way - we were incedibly impressed & put it on our list of 'keepers'....while very noisy, we will be back.
Service: relatively good, thought the waiter had too many tables
Drinks/cocktails - interesting & creative. 
Appetizers - butterfish tataki....incredible & pork belly was good. 
Entree: robata grilled Prime NY Strip Loin with truffle aioli....we ordered medium rare & was presented sliced with micro greens on top....one of the best steaks we've ever eaten. Unfortunately my partner found the side order of brussel spouts oily & limp - but we thought that was a small miss. 
We can't wait to go back & try different items."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  Loved everything that we ordered.  The ambiance was nice, but the acoustics in this place was not good at all.  I'm not sure if it was because it was a Friday night, but it was so loud, you couldn't even hear the people on your table talking.   We couldn't even have a dinner conversation.  It was so bad!!!!!  But other than that, the food was good.  The service was good.   We ordered steaks, sashimi, and a bunch of appetizers - everything was prepared perfectly.  The quality of the raw fish was awesome!   I was pretty impressed.  The one thing that did bug me was that we arrived a bit early for our reservation - got there at 7:00 for a 7:30 pm reservation. The host told us that we got there \"too early\" and so we couldn't be seated and had to wait in the bar.  I mean, the restaurant at that time was not busy.  There were a bunch of empty tables.  His reason was that there were other reservations that were on their way in.  Okay, so if that was the case, then why couldn't he have given them our table when those people came in?  Was it that hard to shuffle?  I mean seriously.  He made us wait int he bar until right until 7:30 pm on the nose.  That was pretty lame.  We were starving.  We ordered appetizers in the bar as well but they were out of the croquettes that we ordered so we just got corn fritters - those were okay.  Our bar server was a sweetheart.  She initially said that they normally don't transfer bar tabs over but she did it for us.  That was nice of her.  But honestly, why wouldn't you transfer bar tabs over, especially if you're the ones making us wait in the bar to begin with!??!?!  So that is my one gripe.  Food was great, but management should work out some of the service kinks!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 12 of us on a Saturday night.  We told them it was a farewell party.  They arranged so we were all seating together in the back of the place behind the bar.  It was perfect for us to chat, get pics, and share food up and down the long tables they lined up for us.  

I think we ordered almost everything off the menu (appetizers, drinks, sides, sushi, rice, main dishes, desserts, etc).  Everything I tasted was FABULOUS!  

I will be suggestion this place to my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Akor with one objective: to go town on some seriously delicious sushi. I'm sad to report that we did not meet our objective. 

We wanted a lot of sushi. But the sashimi was overpriced. I mean, straight fish, no sauce, no nothing, super expensive. There was no reason for it. There are plenty more high quality fish served at half the price elsewhere.

The rolls were disappointing, too, because they were overpriced as well. They were not that interesting. The spider roll was small and did not have good flavor. We didn't even finish it. We left three pieces on the plate. 

Our waiter was nice, but when we asked for a roll with crunch, he suggested the tempura shrimp ball things. We should have said no because eating a large bowl of fried shrimp was as far from our original objective as we could get. About half the bowl was left uneaten.

The best dish we had was the butterfish, which is made with Escolar. It's delicious but has the potential to make you sick, if eaten too much. It's fatty. I would expect a signature dish at a high-end restaurant to be made of higher quality fish. But, it was good, for sure. 

The service is outstanding and the interior is attractive. It is loud, though, so if you're with a group that enjoys great conversation, sit outside.

The most outstanding dish was a small plate of grilled peppers. It would have been more amazing if I was in the mood for cooked veggies."}
{"text":"Staying at the Hilton Scottsdale, this was a great dinner choice that was less than a 5 min drive away. It seems like an Asian fusion restaurant with Japanese flare. We were there for the HH so we ordered a bunch of small bites to share and some drinks. Very cute place to catch up and talk or for a real dinner. The sliders were delicious and the yellow tail sashimi was very refreshing."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the nigiri -- the roll we ordered -- tuna was pieced together, a sure sign of poor quality-- considering the price they charged no excuse for it. Yellowtail had no flavor - how can that be? Uni -- disappointing. 

Only thing I enjoyed was the black cod (main entree)  - nice portion and flavor not masked.

Service was great but that's not what  you eat."}
{"text":"Came here a couple nights ago to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Had their happy hour menu out in the patio area.

My friend and I split some dishes.  We had the soft shell crab sandwich, the beef sandwich, and the sea bass skewer from the robata grill.  All tiny portions for $5 . . . and that was fine with us since the quality and flavor of each dish was EXCELLENT.  

We were very happy with our selections and talked about coming back to sample the rest of the dishes on the happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. So expensive smallest portions of all time. Whatever you order expect one to two bites of and pay an amount for a decent meal at a great suishi spot. This place will
Be out of business, it's a matter of time. Go to geisha A Go Go instead it's great :))"}
{"text":"First..they have Happy hour 7 days a week. WooHoo! 1st time was on a lazy weekend afternoon for Happy Hour.  The sushi rolls on the menu were decent but not all that elaborate, your basic rolls..so I think I would prefer the extended menu. However what I wish to absolutely rave about is the $2 Roka Burger offered at Happy Hour.  Best freakin burger,I can't even tell you.. but I will try and at a sushi place no less!! The meat tastes like it was soaked in a broth that is unbelievable, with a hint of wasabi. Topped with avocado..it's just amazing. I will be back for the burger alone and I want to try this Hamachi Chili Roll that everyone's talking about.

P.S. I won't give any restaurant 5 stars unless Ive been there at least 3 times and they remain consistent.. hence the 4 star."}
{"text":"Please. I don't know what the rave about this place is when there are so many BETTER and CHEAPER sushi restaurants around the area.

Let me be frank. The sushi was NOT good and NOT what I paid for. Sushi has come out wrong a few times and this place is pricey for what they offer.

Waiters tend to bore you to death with a history of each ingredient and the eccentricity of the chef's menu. I rather eat. Went here with a group of 4, bill was over 200, and left hungry. No joke."}
{"text":"Roka Akor was simply amazing.  The decor, including granite walls and unique wood everywhere; as well as how the restaurant/bar is set-up, was extremely nice to be in.  The food couldn't get any better.  Everything was so fresh.  Since all the portions are small sized and meant to be shared, I was able to try a lot of items.  The butterfish sashimi was my favorite.  Although the shrimp, lobster dumplings, vegetables, black cod, spicy tuna roll, chicken and steak were also amazing.  The chocolate cake for dessert had a funny color green center, but tasted delicious.  The bar had lots of fun drinks on the menu and the bartenders sliced the ice from an ice block that was sitting on the bar.  The service was great as far as knowledge and friendliness and given it was the first weekend they were open, I didn't even really notice that some things took a while to come out, because I really enjoyed sitting at the robata bar and watching the chefs cook as well as speak Japanese.  Roka Akor is definitely a new, fresh approach to dining in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had a fun meal at Roka Akor. It's got a cool vibe and the service was good at the bar.  Overall the food was good but it seems they place a bit more attention on the plating than the food itself.  It is also on a higher price point for what you get, but I guess that can be expected at the more trendier places in Scottsdale:)

We shared 3 items.  The yellowtail sashimi, pork belly and the miso black cod.  Surprisingly my least fav was the black cod which I usually find to be a supreme delicacy.  The plating was beautiful but the fish itself was overdone and a bit dry.

I think it might make sense to try their Wagyu beef as it looked great being served around us. But you have to be prepared for the price tag that goes along with it!"}
{"text":"Been there for dinner several times...  Fantastic!  Most recently went there for a sushi making class- mind blown! #Respect"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely Fabulous!!! The food is amazing! And the service is on point! Our server brad made our 1st time experience amazing and I can't wait to come back! Justin the manager did an awesome job! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"To die for sushi, steaks and seafood! Recommend the Butterfish Tataki with white asparagus! So delicious. Everything on the menu is so full of flavor and the service is on point. Sashimi and sushi selection is higher end and worth every bit of your money for the delectable food."}
{"text":"Wow, there are many in-depth reviews on here so I won't go into detail -- just wanted to give a shout out after my awesome experience here last night.  I think I may have a new favorite restaurant!

We came for the Yelp Restaurant Week menu, but ended up spending quite a bit of time in the bar area before our reservation.  Two rounds of Shochu (HIGHLY recommend the nectarine, so light and clean) and 3 apps later (the butterfish tataki changed my life), we made our way to dinner.  I have to admit that the apps shined above our entrees (salmon terriyaki), but because we had a limited entree menu with the scorching Yelp deal I am not going to fault Roka Akor for that.

All-in-all, just a great experience.  I loved the cool and contemporary atmosphere with all the energy and light -- the vibe is just fantastic.  I will definitely be returning and will put this in the portfolio as a great place for either business dinners or drink/app dates.  Instant fan."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for dinner for some time now but we were in the area around lunch so we tried it. The lunch menu is very limited. not much at all. I got the spare rib sandwich for $10. It came with carmelized onions purple cabage and a side of au ju, a small salad, and a small bowl of soup. It was good but a little smaller than I would have liked it. The GF got the chicken yakasoba nodddles. She liked it a lot. It was large plate of food and served with soup and salad for $9. not a bad deal. We both had the mango tea it was so good. I fyou get it ask for the sugar syrup to sweeten it up a little, they were so good we both got one to go. We also got a dessert. It was a smal piece of withe cake with some kind of custard like filling and topped with a fresh mango sauce and chopped mangos, and a small scoop of ice cream. The ice cream was a rice ice cream with some toasted nuts. It was God Dam delicious! Service was good but they were slow at the time we were there. Love the decour. We sat by the bar. Lots of light colored wood wich made it realy bright during the day. I thought lunch was good but probaly wont go out of my way to get it again. I do realy want to get dinner here."}
{"text":"Had quite a few of their dishes (scallops ceviche, wagyu beef, tuna, etc).  Everything was tasty but definitely short of amazing to get a 5th star (especially for the price)."}
{"text":"Play on word name of the restaurant. Name is sort of mirror image by spelling but not in appearance. Not an enantiomer.  We went yo happy hour.  Until 7. Wine off 30%. House Sake off 40%. Cocktails off 40%. Beer off 50%.  Bar food off 30%.  We were lucky. Got there around 6:30 and there was one table open. 
We ordered a nice carafe of Junmai Ginjo sake that was excellent. It wasn't too dry had little acid, very floral and the little bottle filled multiple sake cups for our enjoyment. However we found out at the end that only the House Sake by the glass was 40% off. 
For food we ordered Hamachi Serrano chili roll which is a delectable combination of the richness of the fish with just a little kick. Butter fish Tatake was fantastic and we ordered another round.  Japanese fried chicken was pretty good. It was sort of a Karaage want-a-be. The chili aioli was good. Chicken would have been even better if it was a little more crispy. Lamb cutlet was the final dish. This was excellent. The Korean Gochujang sauce was the right balance of sweet smoky spicy goodness for the meat. 
We love this place. 
Bathroom was very clean and had a nice scent."}
{"text":"Great service. Food incredible and delicious!
Manager Justin goes above and beyond when it comes to customer service. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Roka Akor has the best food in AZ, hands down. You cannot go wrong here, and you are missing something extraordinary if you don't come."}
{"text":"Food is great..... I just love the ika....service is exceptional......Shauna is the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Roka on the advice of a friend. 

Entering the restaurant, it was clear it was high end, no mere \"Ra Sushi\" experience. For the most part everyone was pleasant. Our server however was another story. 

But onto the food. Pretty much the best sushi I've had in town. The sashimi was fresh and succulent. The appetizers (beef tataki, scallops) were unique and very well prepared, and the tempura was lightly battered -- probably how it always should be done. My parents and I really liked the food, and yes, it is more expensive than your typical sushi place.

Back to our server. As he introduced himself he boasted that this is the best food and the best service in town. As we were pondering wine selections he offered that they had a special Bordeaux-like wine that would go great with the steak selections. We eventually asked how much it was and he volunteered it was around $100. I said that might be a little rich and asked if they had something full-bodied from their normal (sub-$50) list. He replied that we couldn't get anything full-bodied unless we approached $100. As the ordering process continued, he tried to up-sell us along the way. At the end he confirmed to himself that it was the best food and the best service. 

I'll probably be back but need to shake off this best service experience...

{"text":"Tried out Roka Akor last week for the first time.  The restaurant is amazing.  The food was great, everyone loved what they got.  The wait staff was excellent. It is pricey but definitely worth it.  I've had other meals just as expensive but was not blown away like I was at Roka Akor."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  Beautiful. Great food and service.  Expensive so I enjoy their happy hour."}
{"text":"I had heard all kinds of good things about this place, so I was dying to try it.   I have to say that I was terribly disappointed in the food...especially for the price.

I had:
- black cod - unsuccessful derivative of a similar dish at Nobu.  tasted a bit fishy.  flavor was ok but a little bland.
- wagyu beef rolls (sp?) - they said this won sushi of the year in London.  i thought it was just ok at best.  too salty and very little taste of beef.  
asparagus - this was very good but i could easily make this on my own grill

the portions were also very very small, which is probably to be expected but still.  

the decor is great though and service was ok...just ok.

anyway, i think they are going to have to try a good bit harder if they want to continue to operate this way.  people will start to realize that the food just isn't very good."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Sushi restaurants in Scottsdale, we come here every so often.  It can get busy during week...best day to come is Sunday, when it's slow and you get more personal attention.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is very modern and upscale.  You definitely pay for it when the bill comes, but it's worth it in my opinion.

{"text":"No Malibu Rum served here... Yep, the imposter again! No worries because Malibu Rum Barbie enjoys sparkling sake. With names like Poochie Poochie and Sawa, I still get something sweet to drink with a fun name :) The two sparkling flavors are $18-$32 and are the equivalent of a glass of wine alcohol and volume size. A bit pricey! 

Happy hour prices are quite reasonable although you'll be tempted to order a bunch of different items and end up spending a fortune!!

A good place to come for ambiance and conversation. The staff and decor are both pleasant and easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? Used to be my go-to favorite for happy hour. The food is still pretty good but not nearly as amazing as it used to be.  The customer service is now completely subpar. The waitress didn't write down our group's large order then brought us the wrong food. Said she wouldn't charge us for the incorrect dishes that she left at the table and then later when they were still on our bill she  had the nerve to say \"well you ate them didn't you?\" We were there for almost two hours and the only way to get her to our table was to ask another server to send her over. When she came over she was rude. The manager came by to ask how the night was going and when we reluctantly told him (we were trying to enjoy our night and not dwell on the negative), he was kind and offered us a round of drinks. But after he visited our table somehow the service got worse instead of better. It was certainly very nice to buy us drinks but I would have preferred to have the problem corrected. This is actually not the first time I've had a rude server there. When I looked around that evening, the tables around us seemed frustrated as the wrong food was constantly being delivered to their tables. I am sorry to say that I won't be coming back and neither will the people in my group."}
{"text":"Food is alright, but should be better for the price. I like their cocktails because of the large block of ice they put in there. Almost all their food is made with soy so if you have a soy allergy, probably not the place for you."}
{"text":"Had the best steak and grilled asparagus. I had to special request my food be cooked without oils. My only complaint was the food arrived at different times."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! I have not had one menu item that was not out of this world. My favorite restaurant in the Mccormick ranch area."}
{"text":"Roka Roka Roka, what can I say? Hmmm Just like your Name this place leaves me so bewildered I am still stunned from my experience. 
At first I thought I was walking into a huge lobby for a traditional Japanese Osento resort, the wood slats along the 30 foot high walls of concrete were reminiscent at Ito, except the orange uncomfortable block chairs were not, a table for 4 was huge, I imagined myself trying to talk over the din to someone across from me and can't imagine yelling the whole time. Due to the concrete walls, the ultra high ceilings and the open kitchen complete with grilling, the noise was almost unbearable. A dance mix of \"You give me Fever\" was playing and after hearing what the Dutch sounding Head chef yelling Hell's Kitchen like orders to other cooks, I'd decided I'd almost had enough, until a comped ahi tuna tasting menu was offered to me, because we waited so long. 
Granted, we had come on a Tuesday during Phoenix's famed \"Restraunt Week\" but still, overall dinner took 2 hours. But no one else seemed to mind much I guess it's because I was with the same old mug that it just seemed excruciatingly long, I would think going with a bunch of friends would be much better. 
The place was so busy with waitstaff, for every waiter there seemed to be 3 busboys or busgirls, folding napkins that were already on tables, clearing dishes, (8 times for my sitting) pouring soya sauce out of a little ceramic pot into our little ceramic dishes. Refilling our \"still\" water in little uneven glasses resembling pottery at 8 bucks a pop, sure it was Voss, but still! The wait staff was incredibly nice however, although shabbily dressed it seemed in orange wrinkled rayon, the busboys in sharp black looked better, and there were 2 manager looking people running around, this place was too busy too New York, too everything I am not. 
The food however was incredible! Albeit small, my main course steak must've been a 1/4 pound, yet it literally melted in my mouth. 
The sushi was tinged with Japanese pickle, Spring Onion, sprouts and even Japanese Plum, just about every delight that makes the seeweed wrapped slice of heavenly rice taste absolutely out of this world! I had never tasted sushi this slight but wonderful in my life. 
By the time desert came I was tired and a bit woozy from that wonderful Sochu Martini, tinged with cucumber that tinged my lips--2 in fact, plus my kirin which I had drunk...the noise seemed louder still!  
A square piece of hot chocolate desert with a chocolate stripe splashed across a sqaure ceramic with a small bit of cream, with another chocalate sliver, made it's way to my table and made me quiver and seemed to resemble a battle scene. As I sliced into the chocolate with my fork (so lovingly replaced for the desert occasion) the Hulk Green Goo that eminated made me not want to try anything fusion or this high priced again. 
My Cappuccino was in a beautiful cup and saucer but already too cold and too much froth. 
Even though we had come for our \"Restraunt week\" special we still ordered a lot more and the bill came to $140.00 for 2 
Just like the Unisex Bathroom in this place, in the middle of the glass wine celler no doubt, This place is meant to leave one so puzzled, that your money slowly looses itself from your treasured purse and runs into the hands of a Euro Corporation.
No thanks I shout.
I'll stick with my Zen 32, and my Ippei, I miss my Ippei,"}
{"text":"I went here with my friend who so happens to work here. She knew the menu and knew what was good and since we were there for happy hour, she knew exactly what to order. I've never been so full in my entire life. Everything here is amazing, I think the place is a little pricey (she hooked it up so I can't complain) but its sooooo good.  We had amazing sliders, sweet corn tempura, and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember because I'm pretty sure I went into a food coma. We literally ordered everything off the Happy Hour menu so everything is a hit on there. The place is fancy and the servers are trained to treat you like royalty. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"There is Japanese cuisine in abundance here in Scottsdale, such as Sushi and Teppanyaki, but Roka sets itself apart with its Robatayaki Grill. All the fruits of the earth are prepared in view of the guests.   Steaks, fish, chicken - even the asparagus and stuffed mushrooms - are served charcoal grilled.

The name Roka Akor derives from the Japanese words Ro and Ka.  Ro meaning gathering place for people to enjoy a good meal, sake, and company; Ka meaning heat and fire, creating energy.

The restaurant has an unassuming feeling of luxury, combined with a more terrestrial flavor.   A distinctive character by virtue of the menu's quality ingredients, the clean lines and high ceilings of the dining and lounge area,  the earthy tones of its decor, and the geotic feel of the serving dishes and plates.

From the drinks to the grill, I have been swept away time and time again.  For me, nothing has compared to the Sushi or the Shochu.  Because Roka is also a Shochu Lounge, it is of import to incorporate this into your experience.  Shochu is a distilled spirit which can be made with rice, potato, or barley, and which dates back 6 centuries.  It is similar to vodka, and its many varieties can be used as healing tonics, aphrodisiacs, or energy boosters.  The shochu is infused with herbs or fruits, and served with ice that never melts...H2O minus the oxygen which keeps this melange of pure bliss and succor chilled to the last drop, without melting and spoiling the taste.  On this visit, I enjoyed the Honey as well as the Pineapple.  Absolutely incredible!

Spanish Mackerel Sashimi, Hamachi Belly, Buttery Salmon Sashimi, Char-grilled Asparagus with sweet soy and sesame, Zucchini with miso mustard, and cremini Mushrooms with butter and garlic , manila clams with red miso broth and cilantro, Butterfish Tataki wrapped around white aspargus and yuzu, and robata grilled teriyaki, it was culinary fireworks in my mouth.  

Down to the details, from the wasabi root being ground at the table, to the artful preparation and presentation of the food, we were swept away.

I will come here time and time again for the quality, the richness of the flavors, and the great atmosphere.  Culinary exloration and adventure await - and there is good reason for it being voted one of the top sushi locales in the nation, by Bon Appetit Magazine.

Restaurant week will be the perfect opportunity to discover Roka when it offers a three course menu for $25 between July 20th and 28th.

{"text":"A Beautifully done, upscale Sushi dining restaurant with a modern design and natural elements throughout. Perfect for a date night! The menu is flawless and so is the service at least for us anyway. 
Let me just say that their butterfish tataki with white asparagus was so addicting! They have a hamachi Serrano roll that is also very delicious! Our favorite had to be the Hamachi collar a generous portion seared and full of flavor a definite must! 
We shared an Orion Bottled beer and each ordered The pineapple infused Shochu which has a smooth and not too sweet finish, very refreshing. 
 All in all, we were expecting a typical HH experience before our dinner reservations elsewhere but we were pleasantly surprised by the over the top service and 5 star Sushi, steak and seafood options. We will need a do over date night here to enjoy the main dining and Omakase for two. Looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"I'll just go straight to what's important, the food.

The pork belly appetizer had great texture but was a tiny bit salty. Butterfish tataki was good, but the cuts were sort of skimpy. We each got the nigiri chef selection (7pc) and to be honest, only one piece was amazing and that was the otoro tuna belly. Everything else was surprisingly basic in quality. I've seriously had better from kabuki, even the tuna and salmon sushi from Fry's is better. For steak we had the New York strip loin with truffle aioli, OH MY GOD!!!!! Now this was the highlight of our evening. Better than every steak I've ever had from mastro's. Perfect seasoning, medium rare, so so so so tender, and that aioli!!!! I only wish that they brought it on a hot plate because it got cold pretty quick since it was precut. Had mushrooms alongside and they were great! We had no room left for desert but we went for it anyways and definitely had no regrets. The pistachio ice cream with strawberry macaroons and kumquats, heavenly! 

Other than the food I thought the ambience/decor was pretty cool. Young/hip music. There wasn't a lot of people dining in so reservations don't seem necessary. Service was very average, can't say it was what I would expect from an upscale/expensive place. Makes the price slightly questionable considering the sushi is very sub par."}
{"text":"I think this place was more style of substance.  My husband and I could not find what we were looking for, and the menu was no where near what you would expect from a sushi restaurant , very limited selection with the rolls. And I would have expected better food than what we paid for.

One other thing the hostess greeted us and told us that it would be a 15 min. wait to be seated in the restaurant, and that we should grab a drink at the bar.  As soon as we walked over to the bar I see a group leave some table, and tell my husband lets go there and sit and wait.  While waiting the waitress Victoria comes up and says that we could order dinner here too.  So that it what we did which was fine.  The only things is the hostess never came back to check up on us to see where we were.  I really think that's poor hostessing skills."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. owner is not Japanese but doing Great Job for Keepin up. Love the Happy hours . Really appreciated the reasonable  price in Fancy place like that. Pretty fresh sashimi but little more portion would be nice..."}
{"text":"During a recent visit back to AZ, I had the pleasure of dining at Roka Akor with a friend who is well acquainted with the menu.  I was looking forward to trying 'a little bit of everything', and I think we first impressed, then frightened our server with the sheer volume of what we ordered.  :)

We enjoyed an outstanding selection of sashimi and rolls from Yama-San.  All I can say is he is a Rockstar.  Discovering I love yellowtail, he served us five (yes FIVE) different varieties.  I have never, ever liked uni, and he convinced me to give his a try.  Guess what?  I am a fan!  The best I have ever tasted, and from a landlocked state - crazy, I know.

We also had a variety of masterpieces from the grill, which were all outstanding.  One of the great things about how these dishes are prepared is they are all perfect for sharing.

Prime Rib Eye with Wafu Dressing
Niman Ranch Pork Belly with Marinated Golden Beets
Broccolini with Ginger & Sesame
Crispy Brussels Sprouts with Japanese Mustard & Bonito

The cocktails were also impressive - my Manhattan(s) were perfect.

Throughout the evening my only disappointment was that it took until I moved away to finally visit.  I missed 5 years worth of dining opportunities when I lived nearby.  What, WHAT was I thinking?

One important question - do they only hire good looking chefs and wait staff here?  Go see for yourself!  ;)"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty selection of small plates. They have a cozy bar and lounge area that serves a great selection for happy hour. The kitchen is open and very lively, a bar area surrounds it so you can watch the action. Wonderful food and bar tender!"}
{"text":"So, my favorite sushi restaurant in Scottsdale was closed on Monday.  Checking nearby places to eat I came across this place.   Salmon sashimi (8 pieces... Not big ones either), 1 jar of house Saki, (2) 12oz kirin beers, and one order of mushroom caps.  92$ out the door.   I'm not rich.    My friend and I left there hungry and not satisfied.  We then went to stingray sushi just down the road and had the sushi experience we were looking for.  I'm not well of enough to not care what the bill is, but if you want to eat at Roka Akor, you'd better be."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service has issues! Walk in, hostess \"greets\" you with attitude as if you are lower than she and bothering her. Server wouldn't even make eye contact for the longest time to take our order. She seemed the least bit interested in the food, let alone the customers. Ordered a glass of sake, liked it and decided to order the bottle. She gives me a craft of it instead of the bottle. She charged me for the glass and the bottle. I only got two glasses worth out of the \"bottle\" but was charged 3times the amount it cost for a glass. So I paid for 4 glasses but only got 3. We ended up spending a lot but giving a little towards the tip to match her little effort. This is coming from someone who used to be a server. Will not be going back.  Businesses should know better to hire a welcoming personality than Stupid Scottsdale girls that need to get an attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"The food is exquisite. Love the presentation and taste. Very classy. We ordered one of the specials for the night-grilled mushrooms. It was excellent. The sushi rolls are a bit small but tasty. Reservations is highly recommended. This place filled up pretty quickly on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"We hired Roka in Phoenix to assist with catering of a party for 100 people the night before our wedding. Kari who handles their catering services was a delight to work with. They setup a giant hibachi grill on my property and made all kinds of skewers including an off-menu one I requested which they nailed (and should add to their menu ;). 

Inside, they supplied a sushi chef who rolled sushi for a few hours which our guests absolutely gobbled up.  I had many guests ask me for the caterer's contact following the party. 

Kari and her team were very professional. They did an onsite visit ahead of the event to help ensure its success and their prices were fair considering what we got. I also asked Kari to make a very specific type of salad (not Japanese) for 140 people and drop it off the next day and her kitchen team absolutely nailed it. 

Kari and the Roka team were critical to making our wedding weekend such a success. I would recommend them highly."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to be able to attend the Yelp Event here. 

I Loved the classy but comfortable feel of the restaurant, definitely the kind of place I like to hang out, not to say that I don't like to hang out at place unlike this, but I really enjoyed the vibe going on here.
Maybe it was just the Yelpers, maybe not, I'll have to go back on my own to know for sure.

We had Ace Service from the Bar Chief Carson. He makes a mean batch of Shochu! Try it you'll Love it!

The Food we ate was Delicious,The items we tried were not necessarily something I would have ordered on my own but with our pre-fixe Yelp menu we were served a generous assortment of appetizers,my favorite was the butter-fish tataki and calamari. 
(see pics)

I didn't get a chance to look at a full menu to see what else they offer, but I thoroughly enjoyed the selections we were gifted.

I would likely return to sit at the bar or lounge and enjoy those appetizers again.

Where did that star go?

I'll tell ya, The bathrooms(I'm talking stalls here), although very clean and modern, were a little frightening.  
Picture if you will a prisonesque airplane bathroom enclosing you in stainless steel , with no escape and no one will hear you scream.

OK so just make sure you don't go by yourself and you'll be fine!"}
{"text":"I went in here stoned for brunch yesterday, and everything went better than expected. :)

AMAZING food, friendly staff, and they gave us a couple extra things from behind the sushi bar on the house. Could not have asked for a better experience. Thanks Roka Akor!"}
{"text":"Food presentation was impeccable .. The scallop was a bit salty for my palate .. It took 50 mins to serve 3 scallops and mushrooms... This place has a lot of potential if they just improve their customers' waiting time"}
{"text":"While on vacation in Scottsdale sushi craving hit, after reading several reviews we decided to give Roka a go. 

I can't say there was anything particularly wrong with our experience. Appetizers were tasty, we ordered the pork belly, spicy fried tofu and the dumplings, all were good although the pork was very salty 

For mains I had the skirt steak based on our servers recommendation, I ordered medium rare and it came out almost blue. Taste wise it was good. We also ordered the chef sashimi (5 piece) and the tempura shrimp roll 

All and all to us at least Roka seemed to be trying a little too hard. 

We had one beer and two soft drinks, ordered one dessert (warm chocolate cake with peanut butter ice cream - cake was way over nuked and dry, ice cream was tasty ) and one coffee and the bill came out to $180 

I liked the food it was ok but it was not worth the money spent"}
{"text":"Craving for some Japanese, yelped as usual and found this amazing restaurant. Sashimi was so fresh, pork belly a must. Dessert was one of the bomb, i will definitely come back."}
{"text":"So, I don't eat seafood. Nope. None of it, much less raw. So when an Orthodox colleague was coming to town, where the hell was I supposed to take him? It's almost the beginnings of a bad joke: \"An Orthodox Jew and a vegetarian walk into a bar...\" 

I pre-gamed on Chex Mix before dinner because I was afraid there was going be very little for me to eat. That was just stupid. The menu was so huge, I had a hard time making a selection. I tried the grilled sweet potatoes, broccolini, and this avocado roll thing with asparagus. OMG. Heaven. The food was incredible. I would totally offer to eat crow at this point about my skepticism, but being veg and all, yeah.

The service was superb. The server had the patience of a saint as the three of us diddled over the menu and ordered a little of everything. The honey sochu and pineapple cocktails were like candy and I easily would have downed twice as many had I not been with, you know, visiting coworkers. And, yes, it's stupid expensive; my share of the bill was $45. For veggies and two drinks. Oh well. I'd be lying if I didn't say I'm already plotting my next trip. Takeout?"}
{"text":"Was recommended by the concierge at our hotel. Went on a Fri. nite around 6:45pm. Drove up and parking lot was dead, not a good sign. After being seated the waiter came around, it was hard to hear him over the music. When the food came it was, for the most part, disappointing. The tempura was light and not at all greasy. Sauces were pretty good but it stopped there. Those who had the sushi weren't blown away. Expectations were high as the waiter informed us that Roka Amor was voted best sushi restaurant in the country?! One person ordered the waygu beef and it was way too fatty. The pork belly appetizer, again way too fatty. The chicken teriyaki, I have had better. On the whole, the atmosphere and food were underwhelming. I'm confused by the rave reviews. May have been an off night for the restaurant but won't know as don't plan on going back. Expensive."}
{"text":"YAY to amazing service!!! Roka Akor wins hands down for treating my family with class and style for my parents 40th wedding anniversary.  The good was pretty good (nothing really memorable stood out as being amazing for a japanese restaurant...), but the service received by the staff was EXTRAORDINARY!!!   And, the restaurant is classy and cool, which made the experience one that was perfect for their special day.

The highlight? For dessert, the Roka Akor folk made us an amazing dessert platter on ice. It was B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L!!!!  It was fancy and really wow'd our family!!!!  

Thank you, Roka Akor, for making us feel special.  We heart you!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! My husband and I told them it was our anniversary and not only did they send over a compimentary bottle of champagne, but the sushi chef came out and introduced himself and asked if he could prepare a special 5- course meal for us!?  This is very uncommon these days and we were beyond happy! We ended up staying there for almost 3 1/2 hours!  Wonderful Wonderful! Food was fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for this place, I was really excited to try their food. But that was short lived.....

It was voted one of the top 10 sushi places in the US by Bon Appetite magazine.  Really? I'm not going to say I'm a sushi expert, but I have had some pretty amazing sushi in Chicago, Honolulu, and Vegas.  Their sushi was nowhere near as awesome as some of the places I've been.

The place is fancy.  They did not spare any expense with the decor, with one exception...the fake flowers near the enterence....not something i would pick, but we'll look past that.  My friend and I order a glass of wine...and then didn't see our server for another 15 minutes.  We'll look past that too.  And then the food came.....

We ordered the butterfish and sweet potatoes with some sort of dipping sauce.  It was middle of the road, not bad, but didn't wow me.  The sauce they were ranting and raving about wasn't that great (maybe that's why I can't remember the name.....)  We also got the scallop appetizer...also sub-par.  Then came the rolls.  We ordered the unagi, special serrano, spicy tuna, spicy avocado, and soft crab rolls.  The best was probably the serrano.  The rice was perfectly cooked, I'll give them that. 

The food was just ok, but definitely not worth the price.  Sure, the place is really nice, and your date would probably be super impressed, but there are plenty of amazing restaurants in the area.  And Hiro Sushi is just 10 minutes up the road...."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, we had the rock shrimp, Ika, Shishito peppers, pork belly, wagyu duo roll, scallops and the prime beef and kimchee dumplings. Each dish was served perfectly and our drinks were never empty. We sat at the sushi bar and were engaged in charming conversation with Chef Jason. We enjoyed ourselves tremendously! At the end of our meal we were presented with the most amazing dessert, beautiful ice cold fruit with a matcha tart and cranberry panna cotta. I don't even like cranberries, but that dessert was literally the best dessert I have ever been served!"}
{"text":"our party of 7 enjoyed dinner. premium food, expertly prepared.   The staff and the manager Rich was exceptionally great.   Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Being a small business employee myself I hate to write bad reviews but, unfortunately, when I keep going over the experience with fusteration i believe it is necessary. Let me first say that service was wonderful. Our server was very attentive and kept our glasses full the entire time and the hostess gave us our choice of table.

The atmosphere was not romantic due to the umcomfortable seats and bright lighting. We first ordered the sushi which came in very tiny pieces that were defiantly NOT worth the price. They tasted old and we're not fresh at all. I had to send the eel back because of the awful fishy taste. We were then so starving we ordered a roll which again came out very small and hardly had any fish on it. After spending about $100 now our bellies were still grumbling because we were so hungry and decided to order the lump crab meat. I can honestly say it was the worst plate on the entire menu because they completely drenched it in an awful chili sauce which covered up the taste completely. 
Instead of writing a review at this point I decided to first talk to the manager about our experience (telling him that we loved the wine and service but didn't like our meal). He seemed kind of annoyed and offered to make us another crab dish or dessert but after all the awful food we planned on leaving and just going to Sapporo to get another meal. When our check came he only took off $40 ...which I appreciated.... but after spending $56 on bad crab and $10 on eel which I didn't enjoy at all I feel it was a poor effort to remedy the situation. 
I will not be back to roka akor ever again. There are many wonderful restaurants in the valley with better food and atmosphere that have larger portions."}
{"text":"Loved it! The baked lobster roll is to die for and the cucumber drink is a must! We will be back!"}
{"text":"So I don't think I've ever had brussel sprouts before but someone at our table ordered them as an appetizer and they were extremely tasty. You really need to try them.. 

Im not a big fish guy but I ordered the Blackened Cod and it was some of the tastiest fish I have ever had. I also had the Filet Mignon and it did not disappoint. Sushi wasn't bad but paled in comparison to everything else."}
{"text":"Randomly selected this place on a whim while in town visiting. Had sushi and was so impressed by the professionalism and knowledge the company and staff had on their food they served. All the sushi & fish was so fresh. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband made a reservation for my birthday on open table. The reservation noted that it was a birthday celebration. That afternoon Roka Akor called to tell my husband that they could only accommodate us in the lounge area and it will he very noisy. Additionally we will most likely have to wait for a table. My husband said, \"but we have a confirmed reservation! It sounds like you don't want us to come.\" She then said OK and hung up!! 
We scrambled to get reservations at another restaurant where we bought two bottles of wine, had a delicious meal and thankfully had a lovely time. Never again Roka Akor. There are too many other great restaurants in Phoenix who give outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Wow.  Great food and service second to none.  We were lucky enough to have Wesley help us navigate the menu.  Highly recommend a visit.   Arrived at 6.45pm in time for Happy hour drinks at the bar.  Wonderful service from all staff and divine food."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. We ordered sushi which was beautifully presented and tasted fresh. We also got the lobster, pork belly, and pork ribs, everything tasted amazing and had so much flavor. The service here is impeccable. I will recommend to try this restaurant at least once."}
{"text":"Amazing  i love roka akor. A bit pricey but it's worth it. The food is fresh and so tasty"}
{"text":"Three things I need to say about Roka Akor:

1. Best sushi restaurant I have ever been to.

2. Best restaurant (ignoring price) that I have been to in Arizona.

3. Extremely expensive. I think it is more like $$$$ than the $$$ listed on yelp."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Roka Akor several times over the past three years. Let me start by saying that we have sampled several items on the menu and have never thought anything was poorly done. Unfortunately, that shouldn't be a compliment for a restaurant at this price point. I write this review with a heavy heart because other than than the food, I love this place.

No, you probably won't find anything on the menu that doesn't taste OK but you also won't find much on the menu that will send you to the moon. By way of example, last night, we ordered several dishes that were unquestionably good. Not one of them was great and at this price point, all of them should have been.  

I'm not going to go through every dish but as a couple of examples, the tempura shrimp tasted fine but was not even close to the non-greasy light tempura you can get at so many good Japanese restaurants.  

My wife and I ordered the brussel sprouts. They were tasty but that's about it.  It was garlicy and salty and OK.  

We also ordered one of the trio of beefs. There is no question that the beef was good. Maybe even really good.  That  said, I would put my steak on the grill up against this any time. 

The sushi here is fresh but nothing that can't be fount at half the price in about a dozen places in Scottsdale.

Bottom line is that you won't have a bad meal here but, if you know food, don't won't waste your money."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and ambiance.  Had both the sushi and a couple grill items and loved all of it. Their attention to detail pays off."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great atmosphere, but that doesn't make up for the fact their sushi is extremely over priced..... also they are way over staffed... I must have seen 4 or 5 managers, not one ever asked us how the meal was. I wouldn't go back...."}
{"text":"I used to have high remarks for this place, unfortunately the last time we went the food was cold, no flavor, and mediocre. After two dishes, we asked for the check and didn't take anything home. What happened to you roka akor? (PS we came an hour after it opened up so the food should have been fresh.. instead it tasted like it was microwaved from the night before)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The food was amazing. Great flavors packed together on everything that we tried. A bit pricey but highly recommended to try."}
{"text":"We stopped by yesterday after a medical conference for dinner, the restaurant was half empty and when we asked for a table we were denied. The \"manager\" said they were all booked, they were \"expecting\" all their reservations to arrive within half an hour. The host next to him had a silent laugh and a smirk on her face. We asked politely if he was sure they had any availability since the restaurant was half empty and all the manager suggested was to wait at the bar. The \"manager\" and hostess should not judge people they way they are dressed or looks. We were dressed in scrubs because we just came from a medical conference. Very rude and unprofessional personnel working at this restaurant. We went down the street to Sakana and even though it's not as \"fancy\" they greeted us and have us a table within 10 minutes and that place was very busy and full."}
{"text":"Like Jared, I have to say that I didn't pay for the evening.  It was Yelp sponsored.  I did notice that it is pretty pricey if you are footing your own bill.

We were provided a selection of 5 different items, and all were delicious.   Some were presented better than others, but all were wonderful.  They served crispy fried squid with lime in bowls a little larger than soup cups.  There was a half a lime, and a little jalapeno slice in there too. Other than the garnish. it only had a hint of spice.  Not too much.  The next plate was soft shell crab sushi rolls.  Those were a big hit.  They served steamed pork and scallop gyoza that were tasty as well. The chicken skewers with leek were very nice.  They had a crispy edge that set them apart from others, but would still be a good choice if you are there with picky eaters.  My favorite of the evening was the butterfish tataki with white asparagus.  It was a most delicate fish with just a touch of ginger in the shallot dressing.

The decor is clean and comfortable.  The comfortable couches and chairs are perfect for hanging out with lots of friends, or for pulling off in the corner for a romantic evening with just one....

The staff was very attentive.  I also want to add that the valet parking guy was charming, and really fast to retrieve my car.

I would go there again with friends to share some little dishes and wine."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a weekday with a girlfriend. We really didn't know what to expect. But the pictures on yelp looked so delicious. And like they say a pictures is worth a thousand words. So we made our reservation and came in for dinner. We were starving so we just ordered a lot of food. Speaking of the yelp pictures.... boy, did the pictures not do this place justice. 

The ingredients are fresh. Which is super important when consuming raw fish. 

The service was also great! 

I recommend this place for a date night or a simple dinner and drinks with a friend."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and food was good but very small portions of sushi.  I ordered the Japenese A5 which was very good (pricey) and wife had the Madagascar jumbo prawn (yes I said just one since it was about 4 to 6 oz of meat).  We also had 2 rolls along with sushi and nigiri...fresh but not worth the money.

If you come here to eat expect to spend $$$$.  We had to try it once but probably will not be back as the prices are too high for what you get.  My wife and I would rather spend less at Eddie V's or Mastro's Ocean Club and get more food."}
{"text":"We decided to dine here during our stay in Scottsdale, as it was rated one of the top 10 restaurants in the U.S. by Bon Appetit. Hmmm...not sure I would agree on this one. The food and service were good, but for the prices and what you get, I would intend to disagree. 

I was first impressed that the chefs communicated in Japanese saying 
'onegaishimasu' with the waiters to come and pick up the food, but in the end was quite offended when they began to shorten the word to 'mas'. What the heck does 'mas' mean in Japanese? Certainly nothing!"}
{"text":"5.0 stars Boom!  To begin properly, ask for Wesley, he is a superb professional. Let's just leave it at AMAZING. This place is is known for its food. The service was timed magically. Every few minutes something amazing appeared on the table. Did I say amazing? Don't blink, your dirty wares will disappear. Luigi, the manager will stop by just to say hi. Then more food will be presented.   Ordinarily a California roll is just an aperitif. These lil jewels were super fresh and tasty. The tempura gulf shrimp were next, light and flaky. Wesley suggested pork belly. Off the hook. We shared asparagus and corn. I had sliced heaven. I mean, my grilled filet was top 5 nationwide. I'm not sure they didn't sneak in a WAGU steak. It was that good! We shared lamb chops on the bone. Delicious!  Did I mention they have my standing favorite tequila, 1942 served with giant whiskey cube. If you are budget conscious, keep driving. If you are looking for a dining experience, this place is a must when in the Phoenix valley!  Enjoy, we will be back!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE restaurant in the Phoenix area. Everything I've eaten there has been on point, well presented, and delicious! I eat red meat well done, but they served a beef tartare roll for their NYE menu and it was to die for!!!  I would seriously ate anything they served me because I can always count on it to be AMAZING! Can't wait to try their Omakase dinner :)"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting family and just having a really long, taxing day. We decided to drive out to Scottsdale to find something to eat and found this place on yelp. Walked in around 730 on a Saturday night to a packed house. We ended up sitting at the sushi bar which was definitely the right move. You get to watch all the action, have a great meal, and look at the really nice decor of the restaurant from there. Or server, leilani, was amazing. She was attentive, informed, offered great recommendations, and was very friendly. There were a couple nigiri specials we tried, one a crab with truffle butter, and one a wagyu beef. If these are available then don't hesitate, just order. YUM! We also tried some striped bass, hamachi, grilled zucchini with miso mustard, butterfish, and also split the filet entree. Everything was awesome. One of the top 2-3 meals we've ever had.  We will definitely know where to escape to next time we're in Arizona visiting family."}
{"text":"So I was on a business trip and looking for sushi. We found this place and tried it out. Wow! It was amazing! The selection was unique and such good quality. It was such a nice, trendy, modern restaurant as well. Normally places that look like this usually end up costing me a grip.  But it was actually reasonably price for such great quality. I am definitely going back if I need to head out there again. Awesome place!!"}
{"text":"First visit with a friend earlier this week for happy hour. Drinks were excellent and food was delicious. As a vegetarian I ordered the crispy fried Brussels sprouts with Japanese mustard (left off the Bonito because I am vegetarian) and the asparagus and sweet potato tempura. The Brussels sprouts were delicious, bit not crispy as expected, but the flavor was great. The asparagus and sweet potato tempura rolls were divine. My friend ordered the crispy fried squid and the Japanese style fried chicken and loved them. Being in tourist season most places are packet with people visiting Scottsdale, this place felt more like an upscale neighborhood hangout with mostly locals. Only issue was that my asparagus and sweet potato tempura was taking forever. My fried had his food delivered and it took about 30 minutes longer to get my tempura delivered. That was the only glitch. Will return!!!"}
{"text":"This has amazing sushi and my kids love the steak with the truffle sauce!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Roka Akor several times over the past few years.  Their food does not disappoint!  Now, we do not go here for the sushi necessarily, although we usually get a roll or two.  The highlight of this place truly is the robata grill.  Some of the best menu items are the butterfish, the pork belly appetizer, as well as the lamb chops (not in any particular order).  Their food really is delicious for the style and their menu is inventive.  The service here is always outstanding as well."}
{"text":"I have dined here several times now and I have never been disappointed.  I'm not huge in sushi but every now and then I'll give it a shot and was pleased.  There dishes other than Sushi are also amazing.   I've had the Duck duo dish which was very tasty and filling.  I've also had the lamb cutlets which were great as well.   The Brussel Sprouts are a great dish to try as well.   On Thursdays they have dollar oysters which I'm sure I'll be back for.  They also have an extensive sake selection.  Although it is pretty pricey I have been very satisfied after each of my visits."}
{"text":"Oh man! I can't believe I hadnt reviewed this place yet! 

We went here for the hubs bday last month. My boss is a big foodie and I asked him what his top 5 fav restaurants in Phx/Scottsdale were and Roka was on that list. So the hubs, his parents and I went. 

We had reservations to sit at the grill bar so we could watch all the action. 

Roka Akor has been named one of the top 10 places to get sushi in the country by Bon Appetit...I DO NOT eat sushi...Ive tried it at RA, ShoGun and Kona grill...I just do not like sushi. BUT I thought, if this place has \"the best\" I should at least try it here....OMG!!!!! I LOVE SUSHI! At least I love Roka's sushi! I tried the Crispy Prawn Maki Roll (it was heaven), Roka's signature soft shell crab maki roll (Divine) and something else that I cant remember because I was beginning to put myself into a sushi coma. 

Who would have thought I liked sushi. Not me. 

You MUST MUST MUST try the BBQ Rice skewer! It was the bomb-nonny. 

I was the driver so I didnt get to have any real drinks, but I did have a sip of the three different Shochu's the hubs ordered and all were amazing! They had a really tasty non alcoholic drink that had ginger in it that I ordered and it was bubbly and tasty! 

For 4 people I think our bill was around $300...but we ordered a TON of food and a TON of drinks (well they did, not me) 

Its a great first date or special occasion type of place, a little pricey for an every day dinner kind of night."}
{"text":"On Saturday night, my girlfriends and I decided that sushi was going to be the meal of choice before a night out on the town. We we're painfully aware of our sushi rut and were very excited to try something new (especially a place that has food happy hour prices from 5-cl-we're all struggling students/ just graduated and enjoy amazing food, we don't always have the pockets to fund our eating habits).  We arrived around 9ish and we're graciously welcomed and seated in the lounge. I enjoyed to decor it was sleek, sexy and modern. I would not recommend saki bombing there, you have to buy the saki and beer separate. Our waitress was nice and meant well, but things just took that extra 5 minutes too long (and it wasn't very crowded). Since we were going out to Scottsdale afterwards we ate light. We tried the Salmon Avocado Roll, Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll, edamame, spicy salmon roll and the kobe burgers. The  sushi was extremely fresh and Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll really stood out, it had just enough kick. The kobe burgers we're just the right size and full of flavor. I enjoyed the experience but wouldn't recommend it for that pre-sushi spot before going out on the town (which I don't think is what Roka is going for anyways)."}
{"text":"We spent almost a week in Scottsdale and by far, this was my favorite restaurant! Although there are about 7-10 traditional sushi rolls, it's really about the grilling menu that makes it so unique. I also love the open dining area and you can see the chefs preparing your food on the robata grill. We ordered the soft shell crab roll and pork belly for appetizers - very tasty. For dinner we shared the Black Cod Miso and that was my very favorite thing on the menu! Light, buttery and sweet, and grilled. We loved our dinner so much we ended up coming here two more times during our trip but ate at the bar for happy hour (5pm-10pm!). I would have given it 5 stars, but the portions were just a wee bit small for the price (a black code skewer was $5 at happy hour, but literally it was like 2 bites big!). Check out the block of ice in the bar and how the bartender cuts it for shochu drinks...pretty interesting to watch!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambience and presentation but significant misses on the price points. For example, for $18 we got two scallops which were not overly flavorful or impressive. The 7 types of sashimi we ordered were quite thin and cost $56. Ouch!! We frequently dine out and have been to several sushi restaurants and were very disappointed."}
{"text":"This was one of our best dining experiences in Scottsdale. We had reservations for 6 at 8pm on a Saturday night. We arrived to a packed restaurant and told to wait. The hostess quickly explained there was issues with our reservations and offered us their private dining room. Sweet. The service was great.  I went with the Deluxe Platter, was a bit pricey, but was one of the best looking and tasting Sashimi platters I've ever tried. Wifey went with the Tempura Veggies and the Ribs. Both were excellent. The others in our party have everything from the Sushi Rolls to the Japanese  Wagyu. Everything was prepared expertly and tasted fantastic. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for Valentines Day and the food was phenomenal! BUT, our server was EXTREMELY rude! I have never been treated with so much disrespect at a restaurant! We had many questions about the menu and we were nervous to even ask because he made us feel like idiots every time we asked about something. You'd think a restaurant that costs $130 PER PERSON (not including tip) would treat us with some sort of  respect. Completely uncalled for and that's why I'm yelping."}
{"text":"Really good steaks.  It melted in your mouth.  I enjoyed everything I ordered.  Butterfish, scallops, two different steaks, hamachi roll.  The service was great."}
{"text":"Love this place so much. They have happy hour all summer in the bar area. This is a great date night or girls night out restaurant. The Brussel sprouts are a must order. Just get a bunch of small plates so you can try everything! Black cod entree was delicious."}
{"text":"Had the Omakase with the wife. Chef is a great guy named Roman from Munich. He comes by and asks what you don't like and like. There are four courses and each course is about 10 dishes each. The Sushi course was outrageous - the freshness unbelievable. Only bad - the flavored sochu is pretty gross and overpriced and the dessert was waaaaaay to sour (they replaced it). $350 for dinner but worth it for us and hey, my wife doesn't even like Japanese food really!! I'm coming back."}
{"text":"The waitress we had was really nice and explained everything on the menu and then again as things came out."}
{"text":"Roka was pretty good, i recommend getting sashimi here based almost soley on the fact that they give you fresh ground wasabi with it!!! i have a love affair for horse radish so um, yeah i enjoyed the wasabi from that.

Very good food, but to be honest it better for being at the price range it was at.

The server was good and friendly. This place has a more laid back atmosphere and so there really isn't a server breathing down your neck all the time trying to bombard you with service. They show up at the correct time and always are willing to help you if you need it. 

We had a spider roll, dynamite, the korean pork belly with kimchi, and yellowtail sashimi.
The spider roll was the better of the two rolls.  They gave us an aioli sauce with the spider roll, that really had no benefit to the dish at all. It was there but didn't add anything special.
On the Dynamite it was actually dissapointing. The Scallops were sliced soo thinly ontop that it was virtually not there. Couldn't taste it and it ended up just being just an EHHH type of roll. I'd pass on that next time.  The Korean Pork Belly was really good, it had a nice and might i say beautiful char on it which not only provided a great smokey flavor (not burnt flavor mind you), but also gave it the characteristic we all wish for... the melt in your mouth. I'd definitely would want to get this dish again. Putting a piece of the home made kimchi on it with a bite was a winner. Home-made kimchi was impressive because i wasn't expecting too much from it. Definitely was NOT my favorite kimchi, but it was a lot better than i thought it would be. 
Lastly as i eluded to earlier the sashimi was not only cut beautifully and fresher than other places i've had, but it was served with fresh ground wasabi. should i say more? too bad i will, I LOVE fresh ground wasabi. I seriously just started eating it by itself, don't regret it at all. Honestly an amazing experience on the sashimi part. 

I'd come back definitely and hope to some time."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is really eclectic and inviting. It's a great conversation place to go to. The lights are dim a little and the waiters are prompt and knowledgeable about whats on the menu and give you advice on food choices if you're having a hard time deciding.

I highly recommend the skewers! They are all amazing, especially the ginger and sweet potato one with like a glazed marinade. Oh. My. Gosh. So good!

The sushi roles were really tasty too and beautifully presented. The miso soup was a miss. Very sodium tasting and a little too chunky for what I'm accustom to.You should go here if you've never been. They also have a patio you can eat at when the weather permits ;)"}
{"text":"This place hits a home run with the tasting menu, one of the finest dining experiences I can remember. The service is wonderful, excellent decor, strong drink, what else could one ask for. While I won't bore you with the details of all 10 courses, some highlights included the fried squid, Wagyu sushi (mouth orgasm), and yes, the first course, the heirloom tomatos. The rice dish they serve for course 9 could be done away with, but other than that I can find nothing to complain about. If your a glutten for good food, can stomach dropping $65 pre drink for dinner, and want to walk away with your belt buckle popping, the tasting menu is a must!  Oh yea and don't be one of those douches with a backwards cap on, put some gel in the hair, throw a coat on, and look like your about to eat a nice meal and not about to go to the ballpark (like the tools next to our table)."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward, for so long to go here and it did not live up to the hype. We did get the dumplings, which we okay, but I've had better frozen ones from the grocery store! We also had the truffle fries and were not impressed. We sat at the bar and the staff was not friendly at all. My husband asked what the chef selection was for the nigiri and they didn't know. About 15 minutes he asked if we would like to find out, my husband politely said \"no, we were just curious.\" We actually had planned on eating there, but after all this we decided to clear the tab and move on (a first for us!)!"}
{"text":"When I initially finished my meal, more like a feast, at Roka Akor I thought the establishment was worthy of three stars.  But with each passing day I realized how good my meal was.  To start the space is wide open and offers three, four if you I think the lounge is separate from the bar, dining spaces.  The menu is extensive, although, I did not appreciate the server trying to show off her menu knowledge.  Tons of food and tons of booze from the East.

The deluxe sashimi platter was over the top and included crab legs with a truffle emulsion on top that was melted by a torch.  They were so good I ordered more on top of he platter.  The yakatori was good but I wish the menu offered items such as livers and chicken skins.  The lamb cutlets (really a chop) with Korean spices were cooked to perfect.  All the vegetable sides were excellent.  

If you have deep pockets Roka Akor  is a great location to impress a date because not only if the food excellent, but, also because its a fun dining experience.  Only downside is that you pay for the experience as much as you do the food."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. The tuna roll was amazing. The blue fin flight was delicious.  Staff was very attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"Food was a bit skimpy considering how incredibly expensive it was but it was still delicious. Service was just Ok and tables were so close together it felt awkward to attempt  a personal conversation with my mother with groups of strangers so close, but still it's a lovely place with comfortable chairs and a nice atmosphere and fresh food. Piece of advice though,  if you're looking for sushi their selection is scant so I wouldn't suggest it, but if you want uniquely cooked food and have plenty of money to spend, thus is the place to be."}
{"text":"I have dined at Roka Akor several times, both for Happy Hour and Dinner.  Everytime service has been great and food has been mostly exceptional. The only item I have tried there that I wasn't a fan of was their Ginger Teriyaki Chicken Breast, the meat was super dry! My go to item has always been the Yuzu Miso Marinated black cod and I have fallen in love with their grilled rice!
But everything from their sushi, which is always melt in your mouth fresh and delicious. I am a huge fan of their Salmon Nigiri, Toro Nigiri, O Toro Nigiri, and Chu Toro Nigiri. Their butter fish tataki with yuzu and white asparagus is out of this world. If your there for happy hour which is Sun-Fri from 4:30-7:00pm, a must have is their Japanese style fried chicken that is accompanied by a smoke chili aioli, I could eat that every single day for the rest of my life and be a happy camper! Their Hamachi Serrano chili roll is also another must have! If there is one thing I would pass on, it would be their tacos... Is the fish fresh, undoubtedly yes, but I personally find them rather bland!
Its a must try if your looking for a hip social scene with great food, but be prepared to drop some dough, if your on a budget but still want to experience their amazing food Happy Hour is for you!"}
{"text":"Superb cuisine!!!  Outstanding service and a superior ambience.  This is truly one of the great dining experiences in the valley."}
{"text":"So perfect. Cod, butterfish are incredible. Desserts are unique. Recently voted top steakhouse in America.  But to be honest having steak here is an afterthought.  The seafood is so incredibly fresh and tasty. Easily one of the best restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I was there for a Yelp event and it was great.  I food & service  was really good.  I would recommend this restuaurant to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely, without question, fantastic. I really enjoyed coming here and as a matter fact I came here twice in a row. As I left my credit card with the bartender. Chris the bartender was kind enough to put it in a safe place when I returned. So, without question service here is that 100%. Five stars. The ambience is Kyler retro cool. I can see were people would like hanging out here and a lot of people do hang out there for happy hour.

They do have a happy hour menu and it's price proportionate, everything on the menu was excellent. The pork belly fantastic the hamburger slider outstanding, chicken was great. Actually, everything on the menu looks fantastic I can't wait to go back to try a wagu stake. I did try the sushi it was so so fresh, I can't remember being anywhere near the desert and I have fresh sushi like that. A must to get is the uni , Or sea urchin. It was so fresh it tasted like the ocean."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here on a whim - as we both haven't been before. I had heard they were awesome, and when I saw the neighborhood it was in and walked in, I was incredibly impressed. What a fantastic setting, and superior service. However, people who don't like waiters in your face all the time emptying edamame dishes or refilling your iced tea after every 5 sips - then you'll dislike the superior service. Maybe I'm just used to mediocre service, but the service is almost too much for me. I felt like they were going to wipe my face after I dripped some soy sauce.

Besides the beyond excellent service, their food was brilliant. Their ginger was even top notch. The iced tea was seriously some of the best I've ever had and they even serve it with simple syrup on the side. Their sashimi was excellent and so fresh. Their presentation was a bit over the top, much like their table-side service, but they are really taking their fine dining seriously. Great prices for the sushi too, not that much more than a RA or Sushi Brokers, but total step up in quality. 

I was underwhelmed by their rolls though, mostly because I was surprised at getting fish eggs on my california roll. The texture threw me off, and when the waiter approached me and was told I was hesitant about the small creepy orange egg things covering my roll - he was so excited and said \"just wait until you find one later, they're really fun to pop - like pop rocks\". Although I was so grossed out by that, his passion for the food was awesome. I would come back and ask for the same servers again. They all seem to have their stuff together over there. 

Although I called and asked earlier about gluten free soy sauce (and they said they didn't have any), my waiter told me they had it and brought it out. What  a save on their part! I appreciate any sushi joint that gets how awkward it is for a gluten free girl to carry a big bottle of GF soy sauce in her purse."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Roka Akor when I came in last week.  I was with a large group and we had the private room reserved which was a little cramped as far as seating but it had a nice ambiance and the chairs were comfortable so it wasn't a big deal.  The service here is what really impressed me.  There were several different people coming in and out interacting with us (girls to fill our drinks, our server, a special server just for one of the items) and everyone was very friendly and professional.  The servers especially knew every little detail about the items on the menu and made recommendations, even offering substitutions on things for the two women at the table who were pregnant and wanted sushi that was okay for them to eat.

The food itself was delicious.  Everything was made with quality ingredients, you could taste how fresh it was.  I loved the Dynamite Scallop Roll and the Crispy Prawn Roll, I had the Soft Shell Crab Roll as well and it was good but the other two just blew it out of the water.  I really enjoyed the Crispy Fried Squid also.  The chili and lime on it takes it beyond your typical calamari.  Everyone else at the table loved their food as well, which was almost unfortunate because no one wanted to share!  Can't wait to come back and try some of the other menu items next time!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, tasty and fresh.  The servings are small, and a little pricey, but worth it.  Towards the end we felt like our waitress had forgotten about us.  Most of the meal the wait staff was attentive and each waiter that brought our food was knowledgeable.  We had the grilled scallops, fried squid, spicy tuna, glazed ribs and salmon nigiri.  The spicy tuna and glazed ribs (with lime juice) were the best.  Unfortunately, they made a big mistake and charged my card $366 instead of $149 for dinner.  I'd still go back because the food was delicious, but the billing mistake was a huge inconvenience."}
{"text":"Last night we went to Roka Akor for the Il Borro wine dinner. To be honest, I was more excited to meet Salvatore Ferragamo than the wine. I didn't know what to expect since our first dining experience at this Roka location wasn't up to par. 

But last night was great! They paired the food and wine perfectly. The halibut was a little overcooked but flavors was robust! My favorite part of the 4 course meal was the short rib. It was very tender and flavorful. Not something to expect from a sushi place! Lol."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Roka Akor for my birthday this year, and I have never been there before. I love it! i liked how the restaurant was decorated, all the staff was very nice and approachable, and have some of the freshest sashimi! The first time I came here, they brought us the sushi of the day, and with fresh sea salt which they freshly scraped off this huge rock, that was very cool. everything was cooked right. i got the lamb cutlets, the meat fell perfectly off the bone. was delicious. the service was outstanding. I have no complaints.

now they have happy hour from 5-close we always stop and grab some saki or even a saki-sangria or two :)"}
{"text":"Great for tapas! Bit pricey for the portions - alcohol was super pricey too - but the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I had been contemplating between 2 and 3 stars and decided to go towards higher end. 

Here is the scoop: 

We went there last night for a little get together, were greeted and seated in the small private room. So far so good. We had been explained their menu and sake selection. Still, alright. So, we go ahead and try to order a bottle of sake, but 5 min later turns out its unavailable. humm.. Ok. We order a different kind but 5 min later turns out its all gone as well. Bleahh... Ok, fine. We order some drinks instead. However, a few min later guy named William shows up and brings us a bottle of Rin Sake on the house as an apology. WOW That is nice!! So, we drank our our drinks and ate our rather uninteresting sushi and rolls. Then bill showed up and guess what??? There is $94 of extra charges!!! Yep, they included complimentary bottle and another one we talked about but never got. OUCH!

Yes, they sure took it off. But that was a big and unpleasant souring moment. I do not know if they intended to hide those charges or it was an accident, but i am sure glad that one of us was paying attention to the bill. 

Totally not interested to comeback, i got better sushi place right around the corner."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Roka Akor for such a long time and now that I have I am a FAN! The Kobe beef & Kimchi dumplings are amazing. Our server was excellent! He was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. The food was fantastic. We tried a few items, including the rock shrimp tempura, the filet and the rice hotpot. 10/10 in my book. I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"visited in March 2015, came in from SF bay area for spring training games,    my wife and I had a nice dinner, HOWEVER we felt ripped off when we ordered the diver scallops appetizer, cost of $18,  we got 2 ( yes two), scallops at that price,, really ??   still can't get past that one during an otherwise enjoyable meal of Korean spice lamb, and the ribeye steak.  The entree's are pricey too, but at least the portions are relative, unlike that appetizer of scallops,  I wish the waiter told us you only get TWO for $18 !!!"}
{"text":"let see. 
this place was high on my list on place to eat.
but to my surprise, the food was really .. mediocre at best.
so here 3 of us went there for a great meal. 
the service was great. the place was stunning. and the waitresses really know the menu inside out.
he started to explain the menu items from left side of the book to the right side of the book. amazing.
so I started with Ebi, maguro, and scallop (standard nigiri 2 piece each)
then 1 cook scallop (supposed to be cook with asparagus sauce)
the sushi was ok, but the rice was dry. it fell apart when you pickup the sushi
ok, maybe their sushi is not that great. so we try the kitchen food (cooked food)
we had the beef fillet, rock cod , tiger prawn. and 2 order of mushroom (3 piece in a skewer)/ the tiger prawn only 1 piece (grill to perfection) but lack of taste.
granted the food were in a nice presentation.
the beef was too dry and the ginger flavoring .. hm.. not to my liking.
the cod was ok. size of 1/2  of an apple. 
then here come the bill. to my surprise. it was a little over 300.
I was like hm. we didn't eat that much, and the food wasn't all that great. but bill is a bill.
so net.. net is: if you are looking to have a great sushi. this place ain't it. if you are looking for a great steak, this place also ain't it. but if you are planning to show how much you can spend, this place is a great place to do it.
so after all the meals, we have to go else where for another meal."}
{"text":"Was skeptical at first. I mean how is it possible to get fresh sushi out in the middle of the desert? As it turned out, place was great. Food was delicious and service was excellent. Do yourself a favor and splurge on the  ROKA AKOR Rice Hot Pot, it was about the tastiest rice hot pot I have had. Imagine it like this, part risotto, part porridge, now add truffle oil and shitake mushrooms and herbs. It is awesome.

Trying this place while visiting from LA did not disappoint. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Irene was a great server. She knew what she was taking about. I was initially apprehensive about the price, but after having the food it was totally worth it. many times you pay for sub par food but this was amazing quality fish. Brussels sprouts were fantastic. Loved it!"}
{"text":"With the sushi wave cresting I was beginning to wonder if anyone in this town knew that there was more to Japanese cuisine than sushi. With restaurants like Ippei and Taneko Tavern failing, the choices for Japanese dining beyond sushi were scarce. Enter Roka Akor.

So much to talk about, I'll just hit the highlights. First, the design of the restaurant is amazing. Very contemporary with just the right touch of modern Japanese influence. The Shochu Lounge rocks. The sake selection is extensive and the shochu drinks are inventive thanks to master mixologist Carson Quinn.

A friendly staff serves the exceptionally prepared food with as much attention to presentation as mouth-watering flavors. Some of the menu's highlights include the Butterfish Tataki, Black Cod and the spectacularly large Madagascar Prawn. In addition to the grilled delights, the selection of sushi and sashimi is unique with inventive combinations like the Age Watari Gani roll featuring soft-shell crab, cucumber, kimchi and chili mayonnaise."}
{"text":"Roka Akor once again remains one of my all time favorite restaurants with absolutely fabulous food (best in the business)  and one again great service from Ryan. However this time around they lose a star because the general manager was a disappointment to the say the least. I was hosting a large costly business dinner and wasn't feeling any \"love\" from the manager. No introductions, no follow-up, and no feeling of appreciation from him (sorry I don't know his name obviously because he didn't introduce himself). He cared more moving another party to our table than us as customers.  Bottom line he was the other end of the spectrum from Charles a previous general manager. If Ryan and the food weren't so awesome the rating would be much lower I and I would question going there again."}
{"text":"My buddy force me to go to this place because he had a gift card for 100 bucks I was down because he was buying didn't think it would be my scene but you know what the food was absolutely amazing atmosphere is great and the service from Taylor was wonderful"}
{"text":"my bf took me here for the omakase tasting menu, just because.. :)

I can't remember all of the things but the experience was fun and food was robust. Especially having having a pretty subpar meal at next door shinbay, I really wish we had skipped the shinbay experience all together. We've been coming back since the omakase and had their happy hour several times now. their happy hour menu is equally delicious! My bf,, well now fiancee is a big fan of their kobe beef sliders and robata grilled pork belly with kimchi. I love butterfish tataki. 

out of their menu, butterfish tataki, robota pork belly, black cod, their special tuna trio platter (not sure what it's called) and their signature cocktail with yuzu was what stood out to me the most. but to be fair, I haven't really disliked anything I tried here. 

the atmosphere is sophisticated but not pretentious or stuffy. its very relaxed. I just hate the flames they have outside when its 120 degrees outside and you feel like you have to walk through the gates of hell to enter the restaurant.  
the servers have always been polite, upbeat and not one of them were rude.

go here!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting restaurant.  A bit full of itself, perhaps, but the food is definitely worth trying.  The whole place is arranged around the huge exhibition kitchen and the chefs who prepare these exquisite dishes.  My only problem was that I ordered way too much food for me and my BFF, and our waitress didn't talk us out of it!   Everything is good.  The odd Japanese \"infused vodka-like drink\" was not so great for us, I think we should have stuck with wine.  The sushi roll was excellent, as was the butterfish appetizer.  The grilled peppers were OK, but a bit much for us, and the \"rice dish\" was totally unnecessary.  I would recommend that two people share a single main course grilled entree and try some of the sushi, maybe the tempura (excellent, perhaps the best I've had), and a couple of the skewers, although paying $2 for a single skewer with three pieces of zucchini on it made me feel, well, skewered!
It is a place to try, to see if you like it, but I cannot see why it is one of the top 10 sushi places in the US -- maybe it would make it to the top 100."}
{"text":"As I mentioned in other reviews, I'm a fan of Roka Akor.  And even though this location was great, it did not match the SF and Chicago locations.  That being said, it is still good, the Omakase here was pretty standard although I noticed it had more cooked food, as opposed to what I would get at SF or Chicago.  Service was good, they were attentive to our group as well.  Favorite dish here was the wagyu beef that we could dip on a myriad of different salts (himalayan salt, truffle salt, rock salt).  For the area though, I'd say Roka Akor was one of my favorite meals while I was in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"You will want to make a note of this new \"Hip Robatayaki Cuisine\" restaurant, ROKA AKOR. Food doesn't get better than this! Native New Zealander Chef Nicholas Watt brings his 16 years of international experience and raving success in London to his first Roka location in the U.S. The handsome Watt roamed the dining room engaging his guests with a genuine boyish charm speaking of his days in New Zealand where his mother cooked with the freshest fish. He wanted to bring that to his restaurants. Study in Toyko and his love of fresh fish make Roka a perfect fit for his talents.   My dining companion Julie and I started out with edamame (v) $3.50: steamed edamame with sea salt, hotate no miso-shiru $5.60: white miso soup with scallop and spring onion and maki rolls. We could have chosen any from about 11 different maki options including kappa maki (v) $3.60: a cucumber and sesame roll, chirashi maki $6.90: spicy sashimi fish selection with spring onion and cucumber, age watari gani $8.60: softshell crab, cucumber, kim chi, and chilli mayonnaise, kankoku fu yaki buta $6.30: korean roast pork loin, shiso and chilli cabbage, california maki $6.30: crab meat, avocado and toblko. But we chose the ebi no atama $7.60: a heavenly combination of crispy prawn, avocado, chilli chrysanthemums and dark sweet soy.  We would have been happy eating these all night! 
General Manager Jeffrey Berkowitz stopped by our table to welcome us.  All of the staff was obviously trained to the highest level and the service was beyond any you can find anywhere in the world. Executive chef Bjoern Weissgerber directs the symphony of cuisine to perfection.
 I love how they label vegetarian dishes with a (v). Some diners might be a little apprehensive about experimenting with unusual dishes or flavors. There's no need to fear here. Everything is prepared in such a way as to give your palette a thrill ride to ecstasy! Dishes are on the small side so you can graze through multiple options. Health conscious will find many very healthy low fat opportunities here. Sauces are light and grilling keeps dishes healthy.  The snacks, salads & soups included a wide variety of flavors such as baechu kim chi (v) $4.00: napa cabbage in garlic and hot chilli, butaniku to hotate no gyoza $6.50: pork and golden scallop dumplings, lobster to awabi no gyoza $14.00: lobster and abalone dumplings (I wish I had tried these! They look fantastic!) The gyu no tataki to truffle $14.00: beef tataki with pickled daikon and winter truffle and the abura bouzu no tataki shiro asparagus zoe $12.00: butterfish tataki, white asparagus with yuzu shallot dressing and the maguro no tataki $14.00: tuna tataki salad with apple mustard dressing all piqued my interest as well, but will have to wait for my next visit. 
 Robatayaki Cuisine relies heavily on the 25 foot long robata Japanese oak charcoal grill which is open to the dining area. Sit at the bar facing the grill so you can watch the dozen or so chefs as they work in unison under the direction of the lead chef who hollars out orders in Japanese and they all respond in a loud crisp retort as if clapping out of a huddle. The robata tradition has been handed down for centuries by Japanese fishermen who cook their daily catch over a charcoal fire and use oars as serving platters. An exceptional ventilation system pulls the little bit of smoke straight up but leaves the room with a warm gentle scent that is very pleasing. Roka Akor dishes look magical in their presentation. The maguro to caviar no tartar, uzura no tamago zoe $12.00: tuna tartar, sevruga caviar and quail's yolk are served in a dish with a boat like sail in a bed of crystal ice. We had the ebi no kushiyaki $32.50: wild jumbo Madagascan prawn with yuzu koshyu chilli paste with... well too many words so continues at azphm .com/ dining .. it's all good!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have never written a Yelp review. I am not a reviewer, so the fact I am writing this, I am very passionate- opinionated to do so. Roka used to be one of my favorite places for happy hour. However, despite the great food and ambiance, I can no longer enjoy the atmosphere, since the last 3 times I have been, it has been a pseudo daycare. Who allows babies and children in an adult bar- lounge setting?  It completely loses the atmosphere of why I'm going to enjoy cocktails in a LOUNGE- BAR. My girlfriends and I have decided we will have to go elsewhere now. I'm tired of screaming children feet from me or them climbing on furniture. Roka, please fix this and I would love to come back."}
{"text":"Easter Eggs, Asian-Style:  That was our theme this year, in an effort to broaden our horizon from the usual Easter Brunch.  Off the bat, the excellent service got my attention.  From the first time I called to make the reservation, then to change the number in the party and finally to push the reservation back 30 minutes the morning of, each of the hostesses I spoke with were very accommodating and nice.  No problem whatsoever, they chirped without any hint of tightness in their voices.
It's very modern, with sleek oak and clean lines throughout.  The bathrooms remind me of luxury commodes on a private jet for some reason...
The open kitchen boasting their signature coal oven is impressive.  The menu is also created to impress, with all sorts of choices to throw into the coals and tons of sushi selections.  Our server was also very good, though because we were there at 11am for brunch thought his extensive special-telling went on a little long.  It's awesome that you guys have a million specials and want to highlight your best dishes, but that's more of a dinner thing when we're going to sit for hours and order copious bottles of wine.  Off that bat we said we were there for their signature Easter brunch, not the $12 per oz beef which chef recommends a minimum of 10 oz per person (that cow had to have lived better than most of us do). 
On to the food, most was very good.  I had the crab benedict with yuzu hollandaise.  Nicely poached eggs atop a generously-sized cake full of sweet crab lumps.  The yuzu gave a nice Asian punch to the hollandaise.  Two of the sushi rolls, the shrimp tempura and butterfish, were executed very well but a bit typical.   The ones in our party who ordered the salmon, avocado, and asparagus omelets were quite happy, bellies full of salted veg and firm eggies. and raved about the side of fresh fruit drizzed with orange blossom water & honey.  One got the pork belly & shishito pepper omelet, and wasn't overly impressed but still ate most of it.  The only disappointment was the \"starter\" of sesame bread and orange butter.  The bread wasn't very good, small and ever so slightly sweet, bordering stale with no hint of sesame.  It wasn't offensive, but for $6 each our table ended up with two small loaves of bland bread that was the same bread served on the side of the omelets (3 pieces on each plate).  
I almost forgot the cocktails!  How dare I.  I ordered the special Shochu flavor of they day (Shochu is like a mellow, sweet vodka of sorts) which was infused with apple & ginger.  Someone else tried the fresh pineapple.  These were celestial cocktails (Michelle Bubblehead you have to try them!!).  They also had Echigo on their beer list, which equals an automatic thumbs up in my opinion.

I've admittedly steered clear of this place assuming it was typical over-priced Japanese-themed food crawling with Scottsdalians not really there to dine, but I seem to be wrong.  I can't wait to try them out for an upcoming gluttonous dinner."}
{"text":"7/27/11

Took Mom for our first lunch here, and she LOVED it!  I really should take her back for lunch again (she won't let me treat her to dinner here, as the ticket could get pricey very fast!).  From our starters of miso soup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=QBQnXq0OfJRfDbim4bq8Nw#QBQnXq0OfJRfDbim4bq8Nw and salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=vs7J2Sxqm5CKQD4t737K0w#vs7J2Sxqm5CKQD4t737K0w, to our main courses of sashimi http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=crw2LPM69lGjbf2aR6nfoQ#crw2LPM69lGjbf2aR6nfoQ and robata pork http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=oqQ7SHbOv8iTzf3rnS6XYg#oqQ7SHbOv8iTzf3rnS6XYg, she was in heaven!  Everything was perfect-- from the dressing of the salad, to the meat temperature of the pork (fully cooked, no redness anywhere, yet still tender and very juicy).  I'd say the only thing that didn't impress her was the miso.  I thought it was OK, although not enough soy cubes, but I wasn't too worried about it, since I was looking forward to our entrees.

So glad I spotted the photos in my iPhoto folders... Now I know where to take Mom for our next lunch date!  :)

p.s.  Here's another shot of the robata pork tenderloin-- just look at that gorgeous caramelization!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=HrhOl_vuURZc31AE4wdbcA#HrhOl_vuURZc31AE4wdbcA"}
{"text":"This place has sub-par rolls, mediocre fish quality and overpriced everything. I haven't tried their meat dishes so maybe that's why people love this place but as far as sushi goes, I would not go here again."}
{"text":"I would've probably done 3.5 stars. The place is hopping - and by that I mean a wait even with reservations and noisy and the drinks from the bar were slow to come out. With that being said management was on point, acknowledging the with complimentary appetizers which were delicious. The pork belly, dumplings and a sliced fish all amazing! The portion size on most things were small. I had tooth fish soooo good like chilean sea bass, someone else had cod delicious, the shashimi plate did not even come close to filling up my husband he needed another entree, $$$, the lamb was delicious and a generous portion. The corn side and the sweet potatoes we amazing you might need more than one! All is all tasty but pricey especially if you're hungry!"}
{"text":"I saw that Roka Akor was voted top 10 sushi restaurant in the US. I was skeptical when I read that until my first time there almost a year ago. Now I'm thinking it should be top 5 easily.lol.  

Being so long since we came back here we decided to try it again. Half way through dinner we were baffled why we haven't make this a more often stop. Yes it is expensive..but it's well worth it and a great place to celebrate something special. The decor and the service was awesome!  On our two times here we actually like to sit at the sushi bar and watch how the chefs cut our fish. Last time we sat at the bar and there was a blue fin tuna Skelton in front of us. It was actually cool. 

We ordered the taro tuna sashami platter which had 2 pieces each of 4 cuts of the tuna. Was really tender and so full of flavor.  The taro really melted in my mouth.  In the past we have ordered the 5 price sashami platter and it was just as good. I love the presentation with ice packs and how they use real rock for the display. 

We also ordered 2 orders of the spider roll. I know I can get spider roll anywhere, but Roka Akor is not just anywhere. It was the best spider roll I've ever had in my life!! Simply blows everywhere else away. 

Wife ordered a special appetizer that had fried chicken skins. Very simple but it was awesome! The sauce was kicking hot but a real treat. 

All in all Roka is one of the best restaurants in the valley. I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Do the tasting menu for the best experience paired with the wine or Sake tasting.

No matter what you have to have the butterfish or beef tataki. The best food items on the planet. 

Also if you are not sure on what to order allow the staff to pick a entire menu for you. I have done this and it works very well with large groups. (Its kinda the only thing that works)

The lounge area is a great place for a date, the watermelon martini is killer,(thats not the right name but just say that they know what you mean:)"}
{"text":"Always a great dining experience at Roka in Scottsdale. The staff is attentive. Sushi is always fresh and the meat is always great cuts. When I'm back in Scottsdale I'll be dining again at Roka. Highly recommend the Chefs special for sashimi. Presentation is great."}
{"text":"After my 4th amazing visit to this spot, I have to write a review.  Every experience here has been wonderful.  The paito is even really nice, however I perfer sitting in the dining room where you can see the chefs at the robata grill.

Here are a couple of things you MUST try:
Butterfish Tataki
Any of the sushi...especially the Big Eye Tuna and the Tuna Belly
Wagyu Beef 
Prime Beef Filet
**Hiratake Mushroom drizzled with truffle oil and truffle shavings.  This was seriously the best mushroom I have ever had in my life.  I think this was a special, but ask for it...you won't be dissapointed!**

The sake was delicious and they also had a great wine selection.  I chatted with a few men at the bar before we were sat and they boasted the tasting menu.  Once we were sat at an awesome table, we basically ordered enough that it could have been a tasting menu...but loved that we were not limited to certain options.

I would also recommend dessert.  We had the dessert platter and it was insane!  3 or 4 fresh sorbets, fresh fruit, and 3 (I think...dammit the wine!) different desserts.  It came on this cool boat packed with ice and flowers...very cool.  However we mainly picked since we were so full from everything else.  

Each time I have been, even on Valentine's Day (with no reservations), the service was amazing and the wait staff is always very attentive.

PLUS, this place is right next to Terrior (check out my review if you aren't familiar).  So you can hit up Terrior before or after for some wine/cheese and swinger action. ;)  Does it get much better Scottsdale?  I think not..."}
{"text":"Here's a little recap of our Saturday night at Roka Akor.

Reservation @ 9pm for an entourage of 5, and we were seated in 1 of their 2 ten-people private dining rooms (the 2 rooms can be connected for larger groups). The contemporary decor is just as beautiful as one would expect from a high-end restaurant: spacious, warm red-wood floor with light brown leather chairs, huge open kitchen and a separate bar area. Our private dining room features elm-wood on 1 side (which artistically disguise numerous storage shelves.), and red mud wall on the other.

The menu was... big. After spending 10 minutes flipping pages, picked a couple selections here and there, then forgot what we had chosen at the first place, we gave up and asked for suggestions. I'll try to recall everything that we ordered. Octopus Salad, Lamb cutlets, Duck breast, Short ribs, Rice hot-pot, Chicken on skewers (Yakitori), Sashimi platter (3 kinds), Spicy chicken wings, Grilled mushroom (I think it was Hiratake mushroom), Vegetable tempura.

Octopus salad and Grilled mushroom were on Chef's Choice menu. The salad was very refreshing, herb-y and sour, great to start off our dinner. The mushroom was blander, but balanced out our high-protein dishes.

The lamb and ribs were just fabulous, and you just have to try them to believe. The meat was cooked to perfection, but the sauces and spices brought them to a whole different level. Our taste buds were in heaven.

Sashimi Chef's selection were just common ones (ours came out with salmon, yellowtail and tuna) but they were fresh. As a frequent to Japanese restaurants for a few years now, this is the 2nd place in the valley that I've had such fresh sashimi. AND this place uses FRESH wasabi!!! 99% of Japanese restaurant in the valley uses powder wasabi. Roka Akor uses wasabi roots, which is less spicy but much more flavorful. Just from seeing this, I knew I was at the right place for sushi.

I didn't get to the Duck breast as my friends finished them all, but the side of fresh mango with Japanese herb was... \"unexpectedly aromatically\" yummy (that's the only way I can describe it). 

We ordered Rice hot-pot to have some carb in our dinner. It was delicious, but frankly a bit salty. It is definitely A LOT for 2 people. The yakitori and wings were alright, since they're just chicken. The sauces again were beautifully done but it's hard to impress me with chicken dishes. Vegetable tempura was just to have some veggie, nothing special.

***Now to the drinks, we got a bottle of Azure sake. Roka Akor is the only place in AZ carries Azure. It's lighter and fresher than common sake, has a delicate scent and light fragrance. It is, indeed, a very special sake, made from a natural spring in the bottom of the Pacific Ocean - yes, from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Not easy to do, but very pure water, the secret to this famous sake. Only a limited amount can be collected during the year.
I wish I had room to order deserts, instead, a desert wine to end the night on a sweet note.

The service overall was equally amazing. I don't think our luck of \"landing\" the private dining room had anything to do with it, but I will go back there soon to find out.

Contrary with other reviewers, the dishes while not huge like those at, say, Buca Di Peppo, they are not as small as people think.  Price-wise, it is pricy. Thus, the bigger your group, the better since you can try different dishes and not max out your credit cards."}
{"text":"I came here for their friends and family event, and while I typically wouldn't write about it since it was virtually gratis and it is their start-up week, I didn't even see potential in this place (I went to Bourbon Steakhouse for a similar type of gratis event, and it fucking rocked... I refuse to review them yet because I know I'll be back when they will actually be in operation). As a matter of fact, the only recurring thought I could muster during the entire meal (which, mind you, lasted just under 3 hours) was:

What the hell?

First bad experience here: sitting on the toilet, as a 5'9\" woman, my feet were dangling. Bizarre. And the stalls are very looney-bin-esque... sterling silver from top to bottom with no obvious ventilation or way out if someone locks you in (yes, paranoid is the word you're searching for). 

Second: The chairs are beyond uncomfortable, but wouldn't be so awful if I hadn't had to endure such a long-lasting meal (note to restaurants: this long-lasting concept? Good for relationships and, like, gum. Not so much for supper).

Third: I've had better food at pretty much anywhere that charges even a fraction of what this place does. It was kind of outrageous, but I didn't begin a violent rampage because, as mentioned, they were buying.

Four: Our wait time in between dishes averaged at about 15 minutes from picking up the dirty plates to dropping new ones. This isn't accounting for how long it took for them to clear our table, despite the 9842759873 servers, bussers, sommeliers, and bartenders milling around (I'm not even counting the armada of hostesses). 

I can see many a Scottsdale douchebag or Eurotrash enjoying this place, but it's probably because (pardon me for being caustic) they haven't recovered their taste buds from last night's coke binge.

Sidenote: Our server was awesome. That said, he'll probably find something better very shortly."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey but well worth the money. I got the cod and as someone who is extremely picky about seafood bc it weirds me out I was blown away by how amazing it tasted. The presentation of the meal was stunning, very artsy. I can't wait to come back to this place and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined here Saturday night. Heather Gerry suggested this place to me during a discussion about sea bass. Our server was Wesley. Service was great and he suggested several great pairings off the menu. We had a hamachi Serrano roll, beef dumplings and miso soup to start. Our entrees consisted of lamb and sea bass. Everything was amazing. The sea bass could have had more flavor or even a dash of salt but even that being said I would say it was delicious and would order it again. We paired it with the Brussel sprout side which was out of this world!!!! My margarita could have been spicier but they made up for it with some complimentary sweet corn. It was a five star meal with five star service. The atmosphere was also great. It was rather pricy for the two of us but we would definitely come in again."}
{"text":"Again, there for Yelp Restaurant week, just a little lazy about writing a review. This time I was with my buds Janell & Lydia -- we started out at the bar where Janell and I tried their specialty drinks (think they are called Shochu) -- these were light and refreshing, but don't get me wrong, they pack a punch. We had their butter fish appetizers and that's when I knew I'd bring my hubby here for dinner. The tasting menu was good but when I returned for my birthday, I got to try some other dishes and really liked them (particularly the ribs). We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I ventured into Roka Akor as it is near where I've recently started working. 
I am a big fan of sushi places. I may not be into eating the fish but I am all about some miso, veggie tempura and veggies rolls (...and whatever else I find minus meats).
So upon finding myself on a closing shift and hungry I called them up ordering a bowl of miso soup-$5 and an order of veggie tempura - $6. i was told it would be about 10-15 minutes so I waited 10 and headed over. I spent a bit of time waiting at the bar where the bartender was friendly but very obviously busy.  It looked like the drinks were well poured and I found myself thinking maybe a night after work I could gather some friends up and have some drinks, dining & fun. I will say that this place is decorated beautifully. 
On to why there are two stars. I was delivered my bag and I walked out to my car did a quick glance to see there was a bowl and a box in there as I was walking. 
I returned to my desk and busted out a small bowl of miso soup which was half filled. The tofu looked as if they had fried it. It was ok. I've had much better that was more cost proportionate. I had hopes well, maybe that was a mistake and some how I ended up with a complimentary side version of miso instead of the appetizer. I shrugged it off. I then opened into my veggie tempura, how disappointed was I to find seven pieces of bland vegetables. Had I not looked I would not have really been distinguishing the difference between the vegetables, just so you know my taste buds are not damaged (non smoker, 1-2 a month if that drinker). Now completely disappointed and irritated at myself for wasting eleven dollars here when I could have gone to anywhere else near by to get a portion of something that was actually filling. I still clung to the idea that maybe this was a mistake where the portions were incorrect but alas upon my phone call to their manager today it seems that is what should be expected from this particular place. I will stick to other sushi places that give me more than a double shot of miso.  As you have probably figured out I'm not coming back.
Just for fun, I'll post what I saw when I opened up my food from Roka so you know what to expect."}
{"text":"This my new place when I'm in town. My server named Olivia made my whole experience better. She recommended the omakase menu. It was so good. She was very knowledgeable for entire course. Must try!!! Thanks again Olivia!!!"}
{"text":"Having read all the good reviews, we were eager to try out this posh restaurant serving high quality cuts of meat and fish. Reservations were easy through Opentable. 

The restaurant itself is a large space, with high ceilings which makes for a very open, airy environment. Decor is tasteful, minimal, and more modern, with light brown tones. The kitchen is within eye sight of each diner, and is an open layout so that you can see them preparing your meal for you as you wait.

We were seated promptly and browsed through the menu. There's a lot to choose from, and I think most people will find something they'll like here. We decided on some appetizers- the beef and kimchi dumplings, and prawns + butterfish tempura. The dumplings were fried like potstickers, and had a nice contrast of crunch with tender dumpling wrapping. The filling was very flavorful due to the high quality Wagyu beef with pungent  tasting kimchi. The tempura was excellent. Both prawns and butterfish were battered and fried to perfection for a crunchy, yet light outer coating with tender and flavorful seafood.

We ordered entrees for our main courses- the Jidori chicken and salmon. I was excited to try the Jidori chicken, whose claim to fame is a tastier chicken from freshness (They are typically shipped and sold within 12 to 24 hours of slaughter), as well as being raised free-range and fed all natural feed (No antibiotics). Indeed, the chicken had a \"cleaner\" taste as the brand touts. The salmon was good as well, but I felt like both the chicken and the salmon weren't as tasty and innovative as the appetizers. 

They have a fairly extensive menu of beef cuts that looked appealing, so I may try that next time I want to splurge. I'd also like to try some of their sushi and sashimi.

We ended our meal with some dessert. I absolutely loved the honey chawanmushi. It's basically a Japanese style custard, and is typically a savory dish, but at Roka Akor they crafted it into a light, delectable dessert. I could eat a whole vat of this stuff if it were available!

If you are looking for a tasty non-alcoholic beverage to go with your meal, their yuzu lemonade is delicious.

Service was great. Our server was attentive, and offered suggestions on what to get.

We used a Groupon and had no problem redeeming it. 

Overall, a very pleasant experience! This is a great place to go if you want to splurge on a meal, go out for a special occasion, or if you want to indulge in their happy hour drinks and discounted appetizers."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour!  My server (taylor) was go great!  I ordered a Vodka Martini, and when it barely filled up to the rim she came back and topped it off!  So cool!  You never see that!
Hamachi rolls were delish!
Going back asap!"}
{"text":"Ironically the best two dishes in a sushi place were pork belly and shishito peppers :) fish was OK but coming from San Francisco we are spoiled."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday, and we had reserved the side room in the back corner. It was very isolating and small for the number of people we had, yet ironically it was perfect as everyone was very loud. The service was very attentive, however, I'm not sure they needed to wipe down our table during our dinner. Not all the specialty drinks were that good: pear vodka, sake and mint did not make a good combo. The pork tenderloin was delicious with a sweet miso sauce, and highly recommend by me, to you. 

While we asked to split the cost of the first round of sake bombs only, our waitress still split every sake bomb after that to the group, which was unfair to the lighter drinkers. 

While I was expecting to pay a little more for this place, $11 for a California roll (which was the same size as a $5 California roll somewhere else) and $5 for a Coke (which she took away to refill and never returned) were big negatives to planning a return visit. The service had good intentions but felt a bit inexperienced.

I'd recommend this as a great anniversary dinner or a nicer place for the more financially able. Not a great place for groups that plan on drinking for awhile as the bill quickly racks up over $60 per person."}
{"text":"on vacation in scottsdale - and this place was incredible.  it would stand up against the best restaurants in los angeles.  the place is family style where everybody shares.  you choose a few skewers and some main courses.  can also get some sushi or some noodle appetizers.  we got the miso cod and some sort of beef for the main courses and got a bunch of the skewers which were all incredible.  the flavor of everything was just awesome.  portions are tiny.  i can't say enough about this place!"}
{"text":"This was the best service I have ever received and the food was amazing thank you for a wonderful experience. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I ate at one of the lounge areas near the bar since I was solo for a work trip. The waitress was fantastic! Her suggestions were literally all amazing. I had a roll to start, the filet was probably the best I've ever had- cooked perfectly! I also highly recommend the sweet potato side. Dessert was also great!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give you guys 10 stars!! My boyfriend knows the chef, Jason, and coordinated a special event for my birthday. All I can say is the entire staff made it a phenomenal experience. Our server, Taylor, was a sweetheart and took great care of us. She was extremely knowledgeable on every single plate she brought us. The cocktails were balanced and decadent. The food was beyond excellent. Each plate that was brought out was better than the last. We got the Omakase paired with sake. Seasonal oysters with calamari, butterfish tataki, seared scallops with wild mushrooms, the sashimi platter, and the miso marinated black cod were just a few of the items included. Everything was plated and presented beautifully, I never take pictures of my food but I couldn't help myself. All around this was the best dining experience I've had probably ever. You HAVE to try it!!! Especially the plates I mentioned!! Thank you so much Chef Jason, Taylor, and everyone else who had a part in our lovely experience."}
{"text":"This is my second visit and it only gets better. Sit in the bar at the banquet seating with low tables and club chairs. Server recommended a bottle of sake which was perfect with  our small plates. A must try is pork belly toco and scallop toco. Dumplings, small burger, tuna roll all fabulous. We ordered Ikura. Perfect amount of rice, the best i have ever had. The cold rice wine just right. Go for happy hour with a group. Five thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Honeycomb Shochu.  -With the big crystal clear ice cube.

Drool."}
{"text":"Moe saved the night!

I had to try this place...after hearing amazing reviews...

So after waiting 45 minutes for a table (even though I did make reservations for 8pm) we finally got our table.  (I know that a lot of you like the decor...I just wasn't feeling it...a little too basic for me)  After being seated..it took another 20 minutes to have the General Manager come over to ask us if we have been asked for drinks yet.  I replied that nobody has even greeted us yet.  He took our drink order (I got this Pomegrante and Sunflower Iced Tea...which was AMAZING...weird since I HATE flavored tea) and he even took time to explain the menu to us.  Since we still didn't have a server yet, the GM (now I know his name is Moe) took our orders and even offered suggestions. We ended up with (I wish I wrote down the actual names of the dishes) Shrimp Tempura (out of this world), Cucumber Roll with this amazing plum sauce, this tasty salmon roll with asparagus, beef skewers, and scallops that were AWESOME with this AWESOME mayonaise in the center.  

Of course since their servings were extremely small and my friend Karla and I were sharing...I needed some dessert.  I got the Strawberry and Honey Chawan Mushi with Apple Pear, Passion Fruit, and Banana.  First of all, it looks like salsa, the way the fruit was chopped up.  Then I tasted it.  Ewwww....not good at all.  Moe felt bad, knowing that we had to clean our palattes...so gave us vanilla sorbet and green tea ice cream instead...on the house and even took off the other dessert.

Moe Rules!

I didn't find the place to be too pricey...I have been to worse.  I even played a game with my friend about guessing the price.  She guessed $78....and I said $ 57.63.  I didn't even add up anything in my head.  The bill came out and it was $ 57.85.  (My friend thought I had some amazing psychic powers...)

Food 5 stars...well for dinner.  I won't even comment on the dessert, because I knew that I should have gotten the Flan....
I should give it 2 stars for service...but like I said...their new General Manager Moe...saved the day.  He was awesome!  Moe rocks."}
{"text":"Little bit too expensive but good quality fish. Blue fin tuna sashimi is the best. Cod skewers are my favorite. Rolls are ok. They use real crab meat which is great but it's too strong. Love the ambience. Cocktails are ok but couldn't find in the menu something exciting for me. Service is great and fast! Definitely give another go to try more things from the menu!"}
{"text":"We finally made it in to this restaurant. We usually crave sushi during the day but we found it doesn't open until 430. Pulling up at night looked a little more \"uppity\" than our usual \"Geisha\" or \"Kyoto\". Prices were higher than our usual lunch sushi LOL but totally worth trying new things and the service great. We had a \"waiter in training\" Chris who didn't seem like he was in training at all. He was polite, efficient, and very helpful with the menu and recommending items. I was with a group of people and we shared all our items. The only thing I could pass in next time believe it or not was the (medium rare) ribeye. It was good, better with the dipping sauce it came with. But I don't believe a good ribeye should need a sauce to make it good. 
We ordered the Roka Roll...very good, the crispy something prawn roll, also very good. And the salmon avocado roll was good. 
Grilled asparagus and the salmon appetizer (yum). Definitely a place we will make our way back to"}
{"text":"loved this place, esp our server mike!!! he was sooooooooooo courteous, professional, friendly and made great recommendations. we had the butter sword fish as appetizer... loved the flavor!!! lamb cutlets (more like lamb chops, not katsu), yummy, but hated the side dish of the smoked eggplant (tasted burned, but it was done like this on purchase), fatty tuna belly (2 pieces for $24), blue fin, yellow tails (4 pieces each) and salmon avocado roll (SOOOOOOOOOOOO delicious), spent $150 for the 2 of us. very romantic and gorgeous place to eat dinner with my husband. good job to my hubby for findings this place and made RSVP!!! love it!!!! highlyr ecommend this place! it's expensive, so watch out!!"}
{"text":"Very noisy and the waiter rushed us to put in order.  Tempura, greasy. Smelled like old oil.  My cod was a small serving for $28 with no sides, it was adequate that's it.  They forgot one of our party's order and acted like it took longer to cook, even though it was the same as mine!  They took that off the bill but that was it.

Ridiculous really for the money."}
{"text":"I was seriously disappointed in my dining experience at Roka. I went with a group of 18 and had arranged to have a fixed menu and reserved the back room. 

The food was as excellent as all of the other reviewers stated. We sampled several rolls, veggies, soup, sashimi, tempura ect.   The place itself big, with modern tasteful décor, and the tables were nicely spread out. They have a huge sushi and robata bar and a lounge to the side with all different seating arrangements. The back room we were placed in was big but intimate enough for our group. Our server was exceptional (his name was Casey) he was quick to offer suggestions and really knew the history of the drinks. If I had a restaurant I would steal him away and put him as head waiter!

So why the 3 stars? Timing, or in this case lack of timing. 

We were seated and brought the first round of rolls before our drink orders had been placed.
We actually received 4 orders of rolls before we received our drinks. 
We were served drinks without sake cups, soups without spoons, rolls without soy or wasabi... 
It was a complete mess. I am sad to say the lack of timing really disappointed us, I would return because the food and service were excellent, but I would not recommend it for big groups.

One more thing - They offered to call us a car service to take us to downtown Scottsdale, telling us the fist 10 miles were free. Once we got in the driver told us it was a minimum charge of $25. They really need more organization."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Everything was so great the food, drinks, atmosphere and employees everyone was super nice. Definitely will be going back!! Me and my boyfriend sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef was one on one with us and we had a really great time!"}
{"text":"Hmmm... Roka Akor is one of those places that I'm sad to say... In my very very humble opinion, Doesn't live up to the high rating I see on Yelp.

The service was good. Slightly up-selling (which you can easily put the smack down on). But it did feel a bit douche. BTW. When the waiter says, \" would you like some edamame to Nibble on while you look over your menu\" does not translate to free edamame. Lol. Naive me....

The food was good. Not wow. But good. I was disappointed I got a bone in my sushi. Hmmm.... That rarely if ever happens. Actually, this was the first time ever I got a bone in my sushi. The black cod was very good. Saving grace of the meal... Boo hoo.

The chefs are not classically trained. More Hawaiian influenced than Japanese. The head chef is a guy named Kai. So. Having said this, if you are looking for a trendier Asian fusion place, this is it. 

If you are expecting some type of umami experience. This isn't. Sorry..."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our last night of vacation at this restaurant, which had nice ambience and wonderful service. We sampled and enjoyed a variety of appetizers, sides and entrees, including the edamame with sea salt, and the amberjack sashimi. Standouts included the beef and kimchi dumplings, the hamachi serrano roll (I thought it'd be too spicy for me, but it was just right), and the yuzu miso black cod. We especially liked the crispy brussels sprouts, and ended up ordering a second helping of these! We unlocked a Yelp deal and got the white chocolate brownie, combining that with the yummy green tea creme brûlée. Our server Chris was very helpful and gave us great attention. Would love to come back when visiting the area again!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying this is a 5-star restaurant and I received 5-star service. The decor is plush and very upscale. The drinks were phenomenal and the sushi was amazing. 

I had a chance to taste the spicy tuna roll, crispy prawn roll, and the signature shell crab roll. I highly recommend all three. This was some of the best and freshest sushi I've had anywhere. I also highly recommend the lamb cutlets with Korean spices. I have posted pictures so that you can see how well prepared it was. The pictures only tell part of the story. It was outstanding. The edamame and scallops were mouth watering. 

I will definitely come back to this restaurant and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here about two months back with my girlfriend during a date night. This place is meant for foodies. The mushroom and rice appetizer is out of this world delicious and anything with fish is just so fantastic and fresh. Not to mention there wide array of sake. I had some sort of spicy jalapeno sake beverage that really complimented our meal. I ended up ordering the halibut and it was one of the best prepared halibut dishes I have had in this state (I am from seattle so I am picky with my fish.) The atmosphere is very nice as is the decoration inside. The service was equally excellent as all our servers were extremely personable.This place is pricey so be forewarned. My only gripe is that for such expensive prices, the portions are quite small. A trend I really hate with gourmet food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Service was slow. It took so long to get a drink at a high top bar table that we moved to the sushi bar. That ended up being the saving grace of the whole experience. If you're looking for really fresh sushi, you will find it here."}
{"text":"I judge suhi places by there Unagi and this place passes with flying colors.


Also great wine choices, had some good proceco and guverziminer



I was here in 2008 but great to hear they do yelp events."}
{"text":"Went to Roka for happy hour the other day with a friend. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very helpful, not to mention gorgeous. We ordered: 

-Roka Akor Butterfish 
-Crispy Fried Squid 
-Roka Akor Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll 
-Salmon Avocado Roll 
-Roka Akor Soft Shell Crab Roll 
-Mushroom Burger 
-Roka Akor Sweet Corn Skewer 
-Roka Akor Sweet Potato Skewer 

Everything was delicious! My favorites were the Butterfish, Mushroom Burger, Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll and Sweet Corn Skewer. 

I highly recommend Roka's happy hour. Everything was very reasonably priced. I would love to go back."}
{"text":"Great upscale sushi place!
Food and service were excellent. 
Some downsides:
We ordered the \"roka roll,\" thinking it sounded delicious. Our server described it as a spin on sweet and salty, with smelt and a lot of vegetables. None of us liked it very much, we decided it had too much going on. 
It also does not describe any of the rolls on the menu. This is fine for common rolls such as a California roll, but is confusing for rolls unique to the restaurant. 
Moreover, the music was quite loud. 
Despite all this, the food and service were still excellent, thus 4 stars."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic .... Service ok..... Drinks great."}
{"text":"The staff is as representative of the lovely folks in the service industry of the area. But a restaurant at this price point should blow your brains out... and it's doesn't. The lamb chops were fantastic, but at $42 for 3 YES YOU READ RIGHT - 3 chops, is a joke. $29 wouldn't have horrified us. When you get 5 (smaller chops) for $18 at Flank back in MA which are just as well executed. Price point is STUPID expensive - it is not a Michelin star in NYC - sorry. The fried calamari are chewy, but not greasy. High end feel with not a true high end menu. Not going back."}
{"text":"We have been here now several times.  This Is one of the best restaurants we have ever been to.  The food and service is absolutely the best.   Most everything is cooked in their exposed kitchen.  Everything off the grill is awesome.

The servers will patiently answer all your questions and appear as though they really enjoy seeing you pleased with your experience.

Since we have been here several times here is a list of some items we have had:

For one, if you don't mind spending the money the toro \"tour\" is great.  They have something like 5 different kinds of toro.  From real fatty to a little less.  Melts in your mouth.  The presentation is very impressive.  It is served on ice with different kinds of salt and (to us) a very unique way of presenting the wasabi.

All there other sushis are served perfectly prepared

The steak is excellent.  The flavor is spectacular,  grilled in view over an open flame and quite literally cooked, always and without fail, exactly to you specification.

All tempura dishes are great

Grilled zucchini.... Very good and juicy.

Seabass with miso.  Cooked perfectly.

I suggest you order to share and sit at the counter.  It makes for a very good experience.  This is the place where you should go in without worrying about cost.  Just go for it, tske your time and experience it all.  It will make for a very good experience.

Try their very unique drinks, they are very refreshing.

Or, if you are real daring, the tasting menu is literally a 4 hour experience.  
Did it once.  It's a bit long for us and wont do it again."}
{"text":"The ambiance is 5 stars, the service is 6 stars - even after a long wait to get menus, and the food is... interesting. Definitely high quality and usually I like exotic mixtures of ingredients, but I just wasn't blown away. I'll have to try again certainly."}
{"text":"This place was amazing...  Great customer service and food.  Thank you for making date night with the wife something to remember."}
{"text":"best sushi best oysters best service in the world could not be more happy coming for my birthday soon!!! love this place so so so so much."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love it.  And really didn't!

I was excited to see what was described as an \"izakaya\" style lounge - perhaps my favorite way to enjoy Japanese food -  but let me tell you, this ain't no izakaya.

An izakaya, by definition, has a certain rustic and friendly feel, catering to drinkers with simple and earthy dishes.  This place is the absolute antithesis of that aesthetic.

We dropped by for Happy Hour, hoping for an izakaya type experience.  We had four items from the food menu.  They were OK.  The \"izakaya butterfish\"  was three tiny, razor-thin slices of fish - literally smaller and thinner than a slice of gari - for five bucks.  Even at five bucks, it was a rip-off.  Silly, actually.  Perhaps half an ounce of fish if not less.  And this is the \"happy hour\" menu?  The little cheeseburgers were, well, little cheeseburgers.  Modern Steak does a much nicer version with less pretension. The skewered vegies were ok

Basically, their \"izakaya\" menu had a complete absence of actual izakaya dishes.  Sigh.  Just a more pretentious (and much more expensive) version of RA Sushi for people who don't really want to try anything different.  Hence, cheeseburgers.  Does everything in America always have to come down to cheeseburgers? It's sad.

The design is attractive and very modern but again, not by any stretch of the imagination what most people would identify as an \"izakaya.\"  The concept is not supposed to be to serve little tiny over-priced dishes in an antiseptic atmosphere.  (This is so NOT how Japanese food is supposed to be!)

Neither the staff nor the customers were particularly friendly.  My wife was the only Asian person visible in the restaurant. I think most Japanese people would be simply bewildered by this restaurant's food, style and atmosphere.  It also had that kind of creepy vibe unique to Scottsdale that I can only describe as \"hostile pick up bar,\" a kind of weird combination of sexual energy and animosity.  Ick. (And what's up with that by the way?)

Based on our experience at the bar, I can't really imagine a circumstance where we'd go back.  Nothing that we ate - or saw - was particularly interesting and the attitudinous staff and creepy customers put us off."}
{"text":"Spectacular experience here with one of my BFFs celebrating our November b-days. We came early and sat on the patio. My friend travels to Kauai regularly for work and of course eats a lot of great sushi there. A sushi chef she met in Kauai suggested we try Roka Akor.

Me: Chef nigiri 7pc selection, and the wild mushroom pot
Her: Poke chirashi and Dynamite Scallop roll

We were both blown away with the freshness of the fish, presentation, authenticity and overall quality being top notch. They serve the REAL wasabi, which is a must for an self respecting authentic sushi restaurant. Wild mushroom pot was like an incredibly tasty comfort food (must search for a recipe)

When I booked my reservation on OpenTable, I mentioned it was both of our birthdays and we got complimentary ice cream/sorbets with fresh fruit. Perfect ending to a perfect meal. I seriously cannot wait to come back here, I would put my faith in the Chef Deluxe Sushi Platter (his choice served at market price) or even the Omakase."}
{"text":"Wow!!  We came in for happy hour and had reservations only to find that the happy hour is only in their bar area. We stuck with our table and we were so happy we did. The service was spectacular and the food was incredible. We went all out and shared the prawn and halibut along with the brussel sprouts and cremini mushrooms. We even splurged for the bon bon and were totally blown away!!  I should admit that we started with a soft shell crab roll and it was actually pretty bland. Kind of a let-down, but aside from that, everything else was amazing!  Try this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing everything.......food... 2 thumbs up!   Service from Tanya  was super!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised... that's how I would describe my experience at this posh Mid-North Scottsdale Asian inspired restaurant. I was here for a Yelp event, so money wasn't an issue... price seems to be a deterrent for many people, but honestly - we had 5 menu items and two drinks each, and the bill was below 80 bucks for both of us (it was free, but we asked how much it would've been). That's pretty reasonable. We was expecting it to be much more. 

The ambiance was pretty fancy-pants... a little too fru-fru for my tastes, but it was nice inside. Great wood-top bar with clean lines and modern touches inside. The evening started out very bright and well-lit and then during service the lights turned down to suit the mood. Outside, the building is unassuming and dull like any other shitty NoSco strip mall looking thing, but inside is a much different story. It's an open and airy space. 

On to the food... holy shit. Fucking delicious. I would've ordered none of what I ate - ever. None of it pleases my pallet on paper, but I was brave and popped it all into my mouth and enjoyed every scrumptious bite. Our server happened to be fantastic, but our friends had a different experience. I think your mileage may vary here as far as service goes, but the food is very good. 

By the way... I peeked into the bathroom, and I have no idea how a 5'9\" woman could sit on a toilet here and her feet wouldn't touch the ground - that's absurd. 

This probably won't ever be my first or second or third choice for a place to go for a good meal and a drink, but honestly I may consider going here sometime even if I have to pay. My biggest problem with the place would be that I wouldn't know what to order. I liked that we didn't really have a choice in this particular case. 

I don't know who this place would appeal to... because it's really not meant for people like me. I'm more at home at British Open Pub (which is where we went afterwards), but judging by the non-yelper crowd there, I would say wealthy Scottsdale and Paradise Valley people in the area between 30 and 60 would really enjoy this joint. Maybe the crowd changes to younger folk on the weekends. But even though it's not my kind of place, I had a good time and would recommend it to someone who asked if it was good."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened but we came here 2 years ago and the sushi was incredible so we came back without checking all the other local sushi possibilities. Well it was a mistake, the tuna sushi was horrible!  Everything came out all at once like they were trying to get rid of us and the place had a ton of empty tables.  And expensive! Avoid and check out the competition."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely amazing time. We sat at the bar & robota grill. Brian, Allie, and Micho were very knowledgeable and gave us awesome service. You must try the Kimchi and prime beef dumplings as well as the Korean flavored lamb cutlets! To die for! Thanks everyone."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything about it. Food is delicious, fresh, and creative.  Friendly staff.  Great atmosphere.  It's very expensive, but worth every penny in mind.  Wish I could eat there three times a day."}
{"text":"Well...I've been here several times. I really like the ambiance and the Happy Hour is great! The Chibi burgers are amazing and so is the sushi. Some of the other items on the Happy Hour menu are really good as well. And the drinks are great as well. Wasn't impressed with the regular dinner menu. The portions are ridiculously small and since I can eat like a horse that really doesn't work for me. But a really cool place to take your lady for a cocktail or two. Nice place to take a date.or to grab some drinks."}
{"text":"Food is awesome especially the way they cook it over an open fire.  Everything is tender and melts in your mouth.  I had sushi rolls, veggie's on kebab and blacked cod which was the best part.  The presentation and sauces were phenomenal.  This is the first place I actually had a good high end sake that I took my time drinking it was so good.  I will definitely return many times."}
{"text":"And yet another great night at Roka Akor! The food is unique and the service is great! We went for happy hour on June 16th and as always, excellent! Even if you are doing happy hour, try the hot pot on the main menu! Stan and Pamela!"}
{"text":"They lost a star for bad service!

Our waitress forgot about us. I had to go back in to tell the hostess that we were forgotten (we sat outside on a Saturday night). 

It was packed on the inside. Very busy.

The sushi specialties were EXCELLENT. The best sushi I've ever had, and I've had a lot.

I went with a friend and had one order of each specialty sushi (there are 4-5 kinds).

We also ordered wine and the pork belly. The wine recommendation was spot on. Exactly what we were looking for, the server that finally came to us got a decent tip on the recommendation alone.

The pork belly was moist, flavorful, and tender. Exactly how it should always be. I enjoyed the presentation on the wooden planks.

The outside seating was nice, and contrasted the bright lighting inside.

Would definitely recommend this place to all the sushi snobs out there. Stick to the specialty sushi though.

The manager did come out to apologize about the service, so there's that at least."}
{"text":"Lucky they got a 2 star rating. Food is innovative  and tasty but what an awful environment. The night we were there was fairly busy and although we were hoping for a quiet enjoyable dinner, we had to witness ongoing arguments  between the manager and his staff that persisted throughout the dinner. We could not hear what was being said but it was clear what was going on, this affected service which was oblivious at best. Just a really unpleasant  evening, so much so that the food could not be appreciated.
In an establishment  with prices  like this, they should know that arguments  and disagreements belong behind closed doors after dinner guests have left."}
{"text":"Eat here!  I felt like a guest judge on Iron Chef.  We were a private party of 12 or so, in the small, but modern \"back\" room.  Service was great.  Quick to bring yummy sake to start.  Our group was served an expanded kaiseki menu.  Four small japanese tapa-like apps. The menu changes monthly, so i'll spare you the details, except that everything was wonderful.  The waitresses kindly responded to my repeated questioning \"what is in this?\" And they actually knew the answers.

The appetizer courses were separated by a serving of sushi.  By far the most bland pat of the meal.  Then came a four foot long serving tray of shashimi, and plates of robata grilled meat.  The shasima was atop artfully melted ice blocks.  Very \"cool.\"

Deserts were flavorful, also.  Nothing bad to say, except bring a lot of money.

Ambiance: modern, chic japanese, but not tacky
Service: kind and prompt
Food:  f...ing awesome!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  Everything was overly salted including the miso soup.  And it certainly was not worth the $50 per plate.  We won't be back,"}
{"text":"Our latest travels took us to Roka Akor's flagship U.S. location. The restaurant has a swanky but relaxed feel, with a cool and tranquil, very minimal decor. There were serious diners along side parents with their children. Westley our knowledgeable server was super helpful and very cool. A great ambiance.

The open charcoal grill looks wonderful as does all the kitchen. What could be more fitting than work of art vegetable offerings in lovely bowls all along the robata open counter. All the chefs too, look very good.

Time to let the cuisine take center stage. I started out this evening with the Butterfish Takaki $11. The cooked butterfish tataki melted in your mouth while the white asparagus and yuzu shallot dressing finished out the flavor. I order crispy Brussels Sprouts with shallots and bonito tuna. $6.50. A large serving of simple, tender and delicious.

It's time for our entree, our 'pièce de résistance'. Grilled Lamb Cutlets. $28.50. Three tender, juicy Korean spiced chops on the bone, probably 3 to 4 ounces apiece. 

I also asked for a presentation of traditional side dishes. The chef served cremini skewered mushroom caps $4.50. Sweet corn on the cob, chopped down to 4 inch little triangle cuts $4.50 and half moon skewered yellow zucchini $4.50. 

Everything was served on rustic stone plates, all served in harmony to create an exquisite experience."}
{"text":"Love it! Classy decor, amazing food, I will definitley be back!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended but i must say it was a big disappointment for us. Sushi was quite bad, with little creativity, and the place lacks ambiance and the service quite disappointing. I wouldn't put this on my list of places to eat at.  Roku at the W Hotel is a much better option."}
{"text":"One thing I really like about Roka is its versatility: you can visit several times and have a totally different experience each time. Relax in the loungey bar area and take advantage of the all-night happy hour tidbits, sit at the sushi/robata bar and schmooze with the chefs and enjoy their recommendations, or grab a private table and sit back for some pampering.

The food is just as versatile. The bar menu offers several cooked and raw dishes, and the happy hour prices can't be beat (give the shochu infusions a try, too). Dining menus include traditional sushi preparations, innovative raw fish, and several cooked options - including the hands-down best miso black cod I've tasted.

I've tried the Kaiseke tasting menu ($68 pp), five courses culled from the sushi bar and the robata grill, and the deluxe sushi platter ($38). Both were enjoyable, but the robata portions of the Kaseki menu were way too large for my appetite; on the other hand, I was still quite hungry after finishing the sashimi platter and ended up splitting a full dinner entree with my dining companion.

Service has always been attentive, and the restaurant has some really beautfiul details. In my opinion, it's the type of place that's comfortable for a casual dinner, but is still worthy of a special occasion."}
{"text":"Being from San Francisco, I was quite wary of the quailty of sushi that could possibly exist in the middle of the desert.  You can imagine my surprise, then, when the sake sashimi I had was some of the freshest, highest quality fish I'd ever had.  Kudos to whatever delivery/storage system they employ with regard to fish. Miso soup was great, as was the chicken teriyaki entree.  Ironically, cooked salmon entree - not so much. Best part of the meal was dessert, which was this bowl of toffee/peanut butter/chocolate madness with - get this - house-made candied peanuts! It was actually stunning.  This place is definitely my go-to sushi place in Scottsdale...above and beyond Sushi Roku."}
{"text":"met another couple here for dinner.
all 4 of us have not been here but from the reviews...we wanted to try it.

the moment i walked in, i like it.  we had dinner reservations for a sunday evening.  it was not crowded and we went to the bar first to get a drink.  the bartender had us try some different soju until we liked the ONE and ordered a few drinks from her.  very friendly bartender.

we were then seated and was approached by the waitress right away.
service here was awesome.  as we have not been here, she explained that all the meals are to be shared so it was great to be able to try all the different food that was ordered by each of us.

we ordered a few appetizers...sushi was nicely done.
the main courses...awesome!  kobe beef melts in ur mouth.
all the food had great personality and great combination of ingredients and sauces.

it's upscale Japanese restaurant with great service and great food.
also a definite comeback place if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"I came here initially during restaurant week, but there were so many good looking things on the menu that I didn't want to limit myself. The food was absolutely delicious. Everything we ordered tasted fresh. We started off with the kobe beef and kimchi dumplings. The kimchi was not overpowering, but gave the dumpling a little extra flair. The habachi roll which is a bit spicy due to the jalapeno, but even a weak person like me can take it. I ordered the skirt steak with the garlic sauce and my boyfriend got the Hangar steak. I usually don't order steak, but opt for the seafood. This place is an exception. The meat melts in your mouth. The sauce on the side is unnecessary because the meat is so tasty on its own. We ordered a side of their grilled sweet potatoes. My boyfriend said this it was the best steak he has ever had. Big claim huh? You need to test it out for yourself. Besides the delicious food and the prefect ambiance there is the impeccable service. This is an upscale place and yet unpretentious. Everyone from the hostess and host to the waiters to the busboys treat you incredibly well. They take care of every need, never letting your glass of water go empty. I would even come back even if the food was horrible, but because the service is like no other. I am serious. I have never experienced this great of a service anywhere! Europeans would have MIs at this level of care. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Very good happy hour. Interesting and delicious drinks and an extensive happy hour menu with very fair prices.  The sashimi salad is awesome. Big with lots of fish and and excellent dressing. He sushi is good, even though it's not the most creative. Grilled asparagus and the cremini mushroom skewer were very flavorful.  And the beef skewer was fantastic. Recommended very highly."}
{"text":"I recommend coming here for happy hour! I LOVE their Butterfish Tataki with White Asparagus!! Every bite is so flavorful and tender your eyes pop and you can't help but say \"WOW\" while eating it. Drooool.... Next on my favorite list is their Roast Duck with Kimchi Udon. The dishes that were decent: Chibi Burger, Cremini Mushroom Burger, Kobe Beef and Kimchi Dumpling. 

Overall it's got a clean and trendy ambiance for those of you that like to dress up! You've got people here on a date, celebrating a birthday, or a place to take cute dinner photos with a nice picture-esque backdrop."}
{"text":"Well. I went to Roka and looked at the menu. Everything seemed so delicious so I ordered the most expensive thing they had. It was the full dinner in which you get about 10 different dishes. I had only one dish that was good and it was the steak. I'd go back for the steak since I'm a huge meat fan, but everything else was not worth the price. Not worth my $210 tab. I'm sorry.

Staff was pretty good though, however, I did observe that their staff likes to stare at alot of things, including people like they want something."}
{"text":"Totally over rated! This place blows! Service was just ok and food was not worth the price. We ordered grilled black cod and it took forever to bring the food out to us. I can actually see the guy trying to grill the fish over the flames but keep screwing it up and saw him throw out several batches in the trash. Fish was keep falling apart because he was flipping it too many times. Sushi was not good and didn't taste fresh. Their fusion dishes did not impress me at all. They didn't have any sake we wanted so the server said he can recommend one for us. We said we like ours dry and not sweet but of course the one he brings is sweet sake. We even told the server that we didn't like our sake he recommended because it was too sweet and he didn't offer us a different one or apologize. Over priced and not so great food, we will not be returning to this place. If you want authentic Japanese food go check out Hiro Sushi. They have the best sushi in town!"}
{"text":"What a terrific experience from start to finish, minus like two things.

The atmosphere is very cool. A couple of things I really liked was the way they get ice at the bar. No cubes, just a block of ice and the bartender makes the cubes himself. Also, the \"wine cellar\" is beautiful, not unique but beautiful. Restrooms are awesome, and their private dining rooms are great with a huge 600 year old tree as a table. It is basically an entire tree, as explained by William, the manager. One thing that bothered me almost the whole meal was the lighting, which was very bright. Finally they turned it down at about 8:30 but it felt like a dining hall for a bit there.

Monday night apparently is not a busy night for them, as we were one of three tables, and nobody was at the bar or grill. The server we had was definitely very very good, and perfectly attentive, though as he explained the restaurant and specials he was extremely quiet. I had to ask him to repeat himself and he turned it up, for a second, then turned it back down. Whatever. William, the restaurant manager was awesome as well, making me feel like he was privileged to have me there. We decided to just put them in charge and see what we got with both food and sake. 

The first course, Butterfish, was delicious served with a ginger sauce and  some veggies. Second course of Tempura Rock Shrimp was not my favorite, but good. It had a bit of a Mexican flavor with chile and lime. The Pork Belly came next and this was by far my favorite dish, just absolutely perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I did not care for the next which were the chicken skewers. The main course of Rib Eye was average, and I wanted more pork belly. All of the sakes served to us were great, and dessert was wonderful as well. Foodwise, this was a near perfect evening, with only one dish really being blah, and that was the ribeye.

I do hope they get busier soon, as they are going to be in trouble if last night was the norm. It was DEAD. For Phoenix, this is a truly unique dining option. Roka is a great option for dinner before going out to Old Town, or a great spot to get together with friends to celebrate."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to get in here - This is a beautiful restaurant with impeccable service. I sat at the bar to watch the chefs at work preparing a variety of impressive sushi and sashimi dishes. I tried to start with the oysters - they were out... after that things improved. The spicy squid (calamari) comes in a very large portion, the butterfish melted in my mouth, I also thoroughly enjoyed the short ribs and the scallops. I will be back to try their much hyped happy hour."}
{"text":"Hadn't been in North Scottsdale in a while, recalling quickly all that I had been missing. As i walked in a lovely was coming out in her high heels and all dressed up ready to go hit the town.. oh yeah.. the food the food.

This was an EVFN event, they extended the Happy Hour for us for a couple of hours, and buy was that a good thing. The sushi is incerdible, the miso soup, the salmon the tuna.. all fantastic. I even tried the little burger for $2 ... amazign tastes all around. 

Leelani was our server, sweet and pretty gal who could tell you everything about the menu and what to get..  still see her smile. 

Hope to get back there again one day.. although they knew it was my bday....an no real deal."}
{"text":"Out of this world Brussel sprouts and tender, flavorful filet! Wholeheartedly recommend.  Dimly lit dining room contributes to a romantic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and I was full when I left. This is saying something because usually the fancier the place, the less food there is on your plate. I had sashimi and the salmon melted in my mouth. I also had the spicy salmon avocado roll and there were 10 rolls that came out! The service was absolutely fantastic. They treated us as guests as opposed to just another customer. It is a tad pricey but you get what you pay for and it is well worth it for a nice night out on the town."}
{"text":"Okay the fish was good but the waitresses and waiters kept bringing us food that we had not ordered. Which was a bit annoying because they did it about 8-10 times. Now they weren't extremely busy but they were scurrying around. I have nothing more to say and I won't be coming back. 
- I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Sorry guys. Roka Akor is extremely expensive for the taste and portions. I realize that I'm going to ruffle some feathers here but I expect a lot more from such a beautiful establishment. First, the positive. The entrance, lobby, bar are about as \"Hollywood\" as it gets. I'm cool with that. The table set-up is a little weird. The menu is exciting but I believe it is extremely expensive for the quality/taste. As a Californian who travels extensively, I expected better. Lots of flash, no bang. I would likely not return."}
{"text":"I was invited to a Robatayaki tasting presentation, which was my first visit to Roka Akor. 

From the reviews I had read, I knew the restaurant was about more than just sushi, and I was really impressed by the sight of the kitchen staff building a charcoal fire in the open kitchen (flames, sparks and the whole nine). The invite literature mentioned \"prime cuts of lamb and beef steak grilled over a charcoal flame\" so everyone in my party was looking forward to trying those proteins \"Robata style\".

Cold sake while I wait at the bar for my peeps to assemble? Right on. 

We were all seated at the comfortable and impressive sushi bar with a clear view of the chefs at work at their stations. Say hello to a bowl of edamame, everybody! Various things were being grilled, sliced, prepared with steam, stacked into ceramic vessels with rocks and shells and ice and other garnishes. No plate left a chef's hands without being visually attractive. 

I thought the abalone mushroom could have passed for actual abalone, and with the way it was sliced and grilled, you could fool a good portion of the public into believing that it's some sort of seafood. Especially when it's garnished with pea-sized salmon eggs. One of my group is not such a great fan of foods that once swam, so he was disappointed in the salmon eggs, salmon tataki and the diver scallops we were offered. The scallops were on the rare side, and one of us (not me) remarked that they were a lil too gooey inside for her. I didn't mind, because they were grilled and seared on the outside and dabbed with a lil bit of wasabi-lime-green apple sauce.  

There were small cubes of pork belly that were juicy and fatty and grilled perfectly with just the right amount of char on them to enhance the natural flavors of what is essentially uncured bacon. Powerful tasty.

Niman Ranch Strip Loin came my way sliced and looking a perfect medium rare. It was seasoned with a little sea salt and had a robust beef flavor and a buttery texture. I could have eaten another small plate of it, easy, and if I had really wanted to, no-seafood dude is also well-done dude so his steak was available because it wasn't done enough for him.

I was not a huge fan of the Duck Confit and Foie Gras Rice Hotpot with Perigord Truffle. In my humble opinion it did not stand up to the previous courses. It looked and tasted a bit like a hash I might make with a leftover skin-on chicken thigh and some sticky rice. It was definitely made with upscale ingredients (truffles and foie gras) but it didn't taste decadent enough to match the description.  

Perhaps the most talked about and enjoyed item were Brussels Sprouts. Described as \"Crispy Brussels Sprouts with Japanese Mustard\", they were phenomenal. The sprouts were quick fried to a crispy brown on the outside and Japanese Mustard needs to be a standard condiment everywhere.

The dessert course was an \"Orange Blossom Honey Chawanmushi w/ Strawberry & Lime Foam\". All you need to know about that is in the name, and that Chawanmushi is an egg custard and sorta like soft-serve ice cream.

I tried a Latour Chardonnay and a South African Pinotage with dinner and I'm now a fan of both.  

Service was impeccable. Their staff should train everyone else how to present and remove and refill. I enjoyed letting the chefs at Roka Akor take over and the rest of my group did as well. Except for that one guy who doesn't like seafood or anything less than well done steak. He had to stop for a hot dog at a gas station on his way home."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner last Friday and WOW it did not disappoint! We sat at the lounge since it was just the two of us. The atmosphere was upbeat and get had energy. Our Bartender/Server Phil gave us superb service. He was very knowledgeable about the menu answered every question we had and gave us great recommendations. We started off with the oysters which were delicious just by themselves nothing added. We wanted to try a few different items on the menu so we got the pork belly(great flavor), the hamachi roll which was topped off with a mix poki(YUMM).  But the best of our meal was the Japanese Grade A5+ Wagyu that Phil suggested and also informed us why it was a Grade A5+. I have had Kobe filet before but WOW when I say butter this Wagyu melts in your mouth. The cocktails we enjoyed were perfect! My boyfriend tried the orange margarita and I had their Moscow Mule but when we wanted to try something new Phil asked what spirt liked and made us a cocktail that was refreshing and went well with our meal! Over all experience and great and service was awesome, can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu and send my friends in."}
{"text":"I'll give Roka credit, the must have read my review, offered to make the next visit a better experience and offered a gift card, so I'll give them another try.  Hoping for another Chicago-Roka experience again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Hadn't been to this spot until last night but wanted to take my girlfriend somewhere nice before she headed out on a work trip. Understaffed, food was brought out cold and mine 15 minutes before hers. Waiter was kind but you could tell was extremely overwhelmed.  Everyone else around us appeared to be frustrated as well. 

Recommendation should you choose to dine here anyways.. don't sit on the patio. The style of tables and chairs look like they'd be better fit for a bar & grill rather than a higher end sushi/steakhouse."}
{"text":"Went in last night with the thought of getting some appetizers as opposed to a big meal. We were seated at the sushi bar since we didn't have a reservation and were immediately greeted by Chef Jason who asked us a bunch of questions and was very engaging while he worked. We ordered a bunch of different appetizers, both hot and cold as well as a bit of sushi. Like every other time I've been here, the food and service was amazing. All the servers who waited on us were top notch and the place went from relatively empty to packed to the gills in no time with no fall off in the service. Every time I've come here I always walk away wishing I lived closer and could come more frequently. This place is the epitome of 5 stars every time I go."}
{"text":"If I could come here every night for the ambiance I would! Very modern decor and lovely open Robata where you can sit and watch the chefs at work! There was a live band that played soft rock - John Mayer, U2, Jack Johnson type. Loved it! We each started w/the sochu sampler and by the second shot glass, I was feeling a bit tipsy! For the entrees we had the tasting menu. Decent food but nothing impressive. I've def. had better in SF. I'd order the miso glazed butter fish and sushi rolls on my next visit as they were pretty tasty. Service was good minus the snafu in our order. Apparently our waitress forgot to put in 2 entrees and we had to wait another 20-30 minutes for our food. All in all, a good place to dine."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant period. This place has it all, you can come in a tuxedo and feel just right or in a casual attire and be treated with respect. The menu has phenomenal sushi and world class steak. The bar tenders know how to mix whatever you can think of. The service is on point and super friendly and accommodating, It's pricey but well worth it. You do get what you pay for here and it's worth EVERY penny!!! Your tastebuds will be celebrating the entire time your here and for serval weeks after you leave!"}
{"text":"I came into going here with high expectAtions because of all of the high reviews on yelp. 

The drinks are awesome and the bartenders really know what theyre doing. The happy hour also has a lot to choose from drinks or food. 

The food is awesome- everything on the cold plate section is a must try. However their portions arent that big so if you come hungry you better expect to spend a significant amount of money

Come to roka akor if you want to ball out- go anywhere else if you want to pig out"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after all the hype. 

Decor and Atmosphere was nice.

Food was horrible!!!!  The rolls were tiny which considering the taste was gross is probably a positive.  I was eating free \"business dinner\" and was still shocked at the price for the roll size and quality.  They should be asham of themselves bad.

I will gladly go back to my \"regular sushi joint\"  Sushi Broker's.  Great happy hour, great atmosphere and most important great food.  

This place sucks!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be 1 of the best HH around. Not anymore. Fewer food & drink choices, at higher prices. Fried squid not edible. Sent back twice. Sushi roll only so so. Cibi burger still very good. Einstein couldn't figure out their billing system. There are better values for HH in the area."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous time at Roka Akor on Friday night! They saved the day by being able to take our large group with little notice. We met some friends early for drinks at the bar. The service was a bit slow, but it was pretty busy. I had a glass of wine, one of my girlfriends got a lovely blood orange margarita and the bartender made up a beautiful fruity non-alcoholic drink for my prego girlfriend.

We were shown to our table right on time and had a fabulous server (wish I could remember her name) who took the time to explain both the Yelp Eats menu, the regular menu and about the restaurant. We'd ordered a bottle of wine at the bar that wasn't part of the Yelp Eats wine special but she honored it anyway. 

From there on out, all I can remember is servers filling my wine glass and bringing dish after dish of wonderful food! I had the tempura sweet potato and white fish, both were delicious- I am looking forward to going back just for them! Next, I had the spicy avocado sushi and the hamachi serrano chilli roll, which were some of the best sushi I've had in a while. Hubby's pork chop was cooked to perfection, too. I can't remember the last time we went out and both agreed that the atmoshphere, food, price and service were great. Best of all, he had a great birthday and we had a very memorable time with our friends. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"1st time there with my wife.  Went during happy hour and had several appetizers and 1 drink a piece(alcohol).   All were very good, cremini mushroom caps, pork taco, fish taco and the mini hamburger beef slider and bbq sticky rice were outstanding.  Small portions but during happy hour is well worth it.  Nice cheers type bar and the cooking area is pretty large and you can see the cooks in action.  The location and the ambience are great.  The service was great and the bartender gave us some good recommendations.  We will return."}
{"text":"Well okay! this place seems to have the best sashimi that i've found in Scottsdale area.  It makes me sad that it is so expensive to get fresh sashimi here but you are smack dab in the middle of a desert!  

I'm not sure. I think i would like to give it a 3.75 star rating. the service and ambiance are excellent... The food also good.. but not awesome. I just feel like it is overpriced.  I'm not being a cheap-o either. I think you are spending 4 bucks per single of sashimi here."}
{"text":"This is the place where they make up in service for any shortcomings they might have. Service is always aware of what is going on at the table and is ready to re-supply and fix things. Manager doesn't just sit around and manage. He actually makes the round and checks to see if customers are good.

The food I had here for the yelp event wasn't very good or very well prepared. The pork was dry and very 3 dollar grocery pork chop with cheese on top. At least it was pre-cut :) Would have preferred it rarer but I had no option. The Mushroom side was good.

Good selection of Saki.

Sushi rolls were good. I don't remember what they were but had chopped jalapeño on them."}
{"text":"We had this restaurant in our list for a few years now to try on our date night. Loved the decor, the staff were great and very attentive, the food was so delicious! The only reason I give it 4 star is because it's quite expensive and if you are really hungry u might need to order a few dishes...:("}
{"text":"I must first start off by saying i did not pay for a single thing on the opening night of this new joint.  i have read the reviews of others indicating the prices are steep.  

but i must say the food was fantastic.  the cod, the tuna, the lamb chops (i think it was lamb), the seared meat, the dessert (o my gosh).  the lobster dumplings, the chicken on skewers, the asparagus sticks, everything was more than satisfactory.   infact, i have not eaten such fresh fish in a long while here in town.  

i did not drink too much which kept me far from the bathrroms...I am not 5 foot 9 and i am paranoid so perhaps this was a good thing?
the atmosphere was clean...the food was good...and i don't do coke NORMA ;-)"}
{"text":"This was, by far, the best dining experience I've had in Arizona, let alone anywhere else in the country.  The courses are small and they flow one by one so that you can enjoy each and every flavor before moving onto another dish.  The building itself is stunning and the staff are so friendly and really take the time to make you feel welcome and at home.  They explain every dish and are always nearby for water, sake or shochu (a Japanese vodka-like liqueur).  My personal favorite was the miso marinated black cod.  WOW!  So tender and incredibly moist!"}
{"text":"Roka Akor isn't my typical type place. I usually find that the food I love comes from places where they have put their heart and soul into the food and just ground it out. Sometimes these places look nice but often they're not too fancy and they rarely look anything like Roka Akor. 

Roka Akor is beautiful and huge. The decor is modern and tasteful. They have a great lounge, a huge featured sushi and robata bar and oodles and oodles of wood (which I dig).

So often when you see these huge, gorgeous spaces obviously funded by a good deal of investor money, it's all business driven and the organization has lost some focus on the food.

That's not the case with Roka Akor. I've been there the past 2 nights (and before) for their happy hour and had some stellar dishes.

I'm a Japanese food freak so anything new & out of the ordinary piques my interest. I've been waiting forever to have a real izakaya or kaiseki place in Phoenix. 

Roka Akor is rolling out an izakaya concept in their lounge. For this first week, they are also doing a special where all food and beverages are $2 (through 11/25). It's absolutely crazy not to check this out.

While I wouldn't say this an authentic izakaya, I'm a big fan of what they are doing. I tried most of the izakaya menu over the past two days and had some killer dishes.

The tenkatsu fried pork belly is completely ridiculous. It is right up there with some of my favorite bites in recent memory. Then I also had their burger on a homemade sesame bun. Definitely order this medium rare. We had a couple ordered medium temp that came a bit overdone. The meat was tasty though and the thing that put it over the top was the awesome bun. Super flavorful - absolutely made the dish. They also use this bun on the cremini mushroom burger with wasabi aioli. Also very nice. Last night I also got to sample their Chinese style glazed pork ribs off the normal menu - amazing. I was already completely stuffed but it still made a huge impression.

As far as other things on their izakaya menu, I'm a big fan of hamachi kama and enjoyed their version. Would have been killer with a bit of ponzu sauce. Robata grilled unagi was very nice and the fried soft shell crab with mixed salad greens was excellent. We also enjoyed the butterfish tataki with white asparagus and yuzu. The list is getting long but we really didn't run across any major misfires at all. Enjoyed the sweet corn tempura with sea salt, braised short ribs with daikon, agedashi tofu & hamachi serrano chili roll.

For me the definite standout was the pork belly though. I kind of went through that list in order of preference. I enjoyed it all - actually a bit surprising.

They also have a bunch of great drinks. Over the past 2 days, I had the shochu & tonic (barley shochu with spash of yuzu juice and tonic), tanuki peach (again - shochu & fresh peach puree) & sake-tini (lychee). All were great. 

The last several visits there we've also had excellent service. The staff has been super nice and super attentive. We even brought our young kids (5 & 2) after calling & making sure it was alright. While they are very well behaved, it is still nice to see them welcomed in.

I expect that this happy hour will stay in the rotation. Great food, great drinks. Nice value.

And I also have seen some wonderful looking sushi come out as well so we have to come back and go that route.

While it doesn't look like the places that fall into the norm of what I typically like, I can't help but be a big fan."}
{"text":"8/5 stars. The steaks were absolutely amazing. Perfect cuts. Service was top notch. Great \"feel\" to the restaurant. You have to come here! Everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"Finally made my way to this place after I first heard about it and it is pretty amazing.  Some of the items on the menu were very traditional to the izakaya concept, which is cool.  The sushi was pretty standard and very fresh, but no different from any other decent sushi place, as far as quality goes.  For the price, there are other places that one could go to for the same quality of sushi and sashimi.  The real standout at Roka is the their famed robata grill and this is something they do exceptionally well.  I would have like to have seen more meat skewers a-la-carte style in true izakaya fashion, but this is a minor detail and I've been told they have similar items in the lounge.  Just another reason to go back and again."}
{"text":"Looks like a lot of my fellow reviewers will disagree but I found Roka Akor to be all style no substance. Don't get me wrong the food was good, but I've definitely had better sushi at places that are much less expensive. Making cool designs on my plate with the sauce does not make it worth the extra money. I went because I had a Groupon. I would never go there at full price. Sitting at the bar and being able to watch the cooks was nice. They have an open kitchen right there in the dining room. And the cocktails we ordered were very good (and pretty strong!). 

I wouldn't necessarily discourage anyone from going to Roka Akor, but I personally think it's too pretentious and you could definitely find better sushi place in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Love Love the food here! The price during Happy hour was great. The food was yummy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Roka Akor --- Please bring back Shin! Shin is the legendary sushi/Japanese cuisine chef who launched Roka Akor. He then open Shin Bay, which sadly closed it's doors several months ago. Shin is a former James Beard nominee. Although I still love the ambience of this restaurant, it lacks a little of the original panache that it had it when it first opened.

Tonight I went with a guest and we started with the Hamachi yellowtail sashimi salad. The salad was amazing and had a very flavorful dressing. However, the actual cut of the yellow tail was poorly executed. Still tasty, but I am only rating it a 4/5. We also had the Hamachi yellowtail Serrano chili roll. It was a very flavorful \"rice side out\" style sushi roll. The small slice of jalapeño pepper encased in a creamy sauce added a very flavorful touch. Especially when you use soy sauce with a generous amount of wasabi mixed in. 5/5.

We then moved on to the Bone Marrow gnocchi. This was recommended by the bartender who had already provided me a Yamazaki 12-year-old Whisky with a single rock. 5/5 in its own right. As far as the gnocchi, I felt as if there were two distinct flavor is battling each other. Not to get to dramatic, but I felt as if it was the freshly pulled sword of Excalibur battling with the hell fury sword of Damocles. My guest loved it -- I was not that thrilled. I'll leave that rating to be provided by the individual who tries it after me.

Next, we had the Yuzo Miso marinated black cod with pickled onions. I absolutely loved this dish. Very flavorful, with an awesome presentation! It had a nice cream sauce with small pickled onions that helped to cleanse the palate. See my photo in order to enjoy it's full resplendent nature. 5/5. During this time I also ordered a Hibiki Japanese Harmony 12 year Whisky with a single rock to go with this dish. Absolutely perfect blending of Japanese Whisky with Japanese cuisine! 5/5.

Next, we ordered the Soft-Shell Crab roll with kimchi and daikon. Unfortunately, we had to ask where the roll was 15 minutes later, and they informed us that they had forgotten to put in the order. We then canceled that order and moved straight to dessert. 0/5 for execution. However, the dessert helped make up for our momentary disappointment. We had the Pumpkin Profiteroles. It came with two small chocolates filled with a melted caramel. Absolutely fabulous! 5/5

Also, our bartender was extremely friendly and a complete professional. If it weren't for the missed order on the Soft-Shell crab roll, I would have awarded a five star rating. However, whenever I am denied anything with kimchi, I get a little bit cranky. Overall, this restaurant is a \"must try\" if you have never been there before!"}
{"text":"BOOO!
Came in for a late afternoon snack...and to my dismay....
They totally changed the bar menu! They took my beloved chibi burgers and mushroom burgers away!  They also did away with the sake sangria that I loved! This time I had to settle for a blood orange margarita. :( It was good, but when I saw the bartender make it with Jose Cuervo, I limited myself to one. I got an order of hamachi nigiri to cheer me up. It was just okay. It also was a hefty $12 for some pretty puny pieces. Not really worth it.  Neither was the $11 for one order of grilled snap peas (served in a mystery sauce) and edamame. If you want robata and sushi save your money and go eat in LA!"}
{"text":"If you like Japanese food, this is the best restaurant in Scottsdale. The rice dishes are amazing - with wonderful texture and complex taste. Everything we've had off the charcoal grill has been wonderful. Yes, the yakitori came up a little short but we've been spoiled by the real thing in small dives under the elevated train tracks in Yurakucho, Tokyo - it's impossible to simulate that atmosphere and taste! Everything else is so tasty and authentic that you'll wish you were born Japanese and could visit a robatayaki-ya like Roka Akor every week. 

Start with the kimchi and edamame as it should be prepared. Outstanding sho-chu drinks. All the grilled fish - heaven. We've been many times and we've never been disappointed. On our last visit we sat near the door and someone actually Windexed the entry 3 times while we ate. It's that attention to detail - including the pure water ice block used in the drinks - that makes Roka Akor several steps above anything else. In London, Macau and Scottsdale. Don't delay - highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really good.

Came here for a late dinner Friday night. 

Veggie tempura: large portion and done perfectly. I love the side of curry salt. It it delish and adds depth to the dish.

Rolls were shared but they all were yummy and fresh.

The standout here are the staff who are fun, personable, and efficient. 

Great date spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food was top notch

The pork belly as an appetizer..  to die for. Sushi was excellent, great quality"}
{"text":"This is one of the top places in the valley for sushi, sashimi, and steak. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the hot pot, but that's my personal preference. Everything else is delicious and beyond any expectation I could have. This is an impressive date night spot for sure and I recommend this place to any foodie who loves Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Roka Akor, your food was delightful! I loved almost everything that I ate. The kobe beef and kim chi dumplings, butter fish tataki with white asparagus and yuzu, robata grilled pork belly with marinated beet roots, the unagi, flame seared salmon, toro, and the prime rib eye steaks were delicious! My favorites were definitely the salmon and the unagi...they tasted out of this world and it melted like butter in your mouth. 

But not everything here was amazing...i had an issue with their maki rolls the spicy tuna was not spicy, the tempura prawn was boring, and the hamachi serano chili roll was bleh...and where they lost me was with that wasabi mayo stuff that they served with the rolls...i'm not a fan of wasabi mayo. They were weak.

Our waitress, she had a very distracting herpe on her lip, and a very condescending tone while describing menu items. The food for the most part was damn good. The pretentious vibes and the condescending waitress can be looked over with the excellent quality of the food. The food was seriously out of this world good."}
{"text":"Service was average. Food was over priced. First time in years of using open table that a birthday request was not even acknowledged at check in. Not for a special occasion. Bar and happy hour look cool though."}
{"text":"What a fabulous venue for yet another fabulous yelp event. From the valet to the restrooms. From the vast modern space to impressive and friendly service. 
And the food! Oy Ve (that's Japanese for yummy)...

OK. Admit it. You know asparagus. But what about the rest? Well, you'll have to check out Roka Akor to find out. Cuz I'm not spilling it. My fave was the Abura Bouzo. Buttah! Like a big stick of buttah! I could have chowed down several more. And then several more. Light and airy with clean lines and muted tones, this is contemporary asian at its best. 

Origato. Dori Ori Gato Mr. Roboto."}
{"text":"Great food and great quality. Super trendy restaurant with cool interior decor- super chic. I started off the meal with the calamari and it was soooo good. The breading was different from the typical- full of flavor and needed no dipping sauce. It was crunchy and spicy, how I like it. I also got some grilled mushrooms that were super yummy.Then I got various sushi rolls with the white miso soup, all very good.  I sat at the grilling bar and watched the cooks prepare all the meals. I saw them grilled these shrimp that were the size of lobsters ( a must try the next time I go) and I also seen them grill cod in banana leaves and my waiter said it was one of the most ordered items on the menu because it melts in your mouth....I was pissed she didn't mention this before I ordered! lol"}
{"text":"Fresh, excellent quality. Each dish has a distinctive flavor.  Plenty of vegetarian options too!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome time at Roka Akor Scottsdale. We sat in the bar/lounge area for Sunday happy hour. The drinks were awesome. You have to get the fried brussel sprouts, yakitori and the mini burgers. We also had the garlic edamame and the beef dumplings. Everything was really good. The service was awesome. What I really like is that the staff clearly worked as a team to insure that guests are well taken care of..The General.Manager even came outside to take a pic of me and my friends. We periodically come to Scottsdale from Michigan for girls spa getaways.. we will be back to Roka Akor"}
{"text":"Roka Akor has a classy atmosphere, and a slightly formidable menu to pick from. Everything looks so good, and in a new environment, I want to try it all! But my date and I, after much deliberation, decided to \"go for broke\", as it were and if we couldn't finish, at least we had a good sample of the menu. 

 For an appetizer, we got the butterfish tataki and the burnt red tomato salad. These were yummy little tidbits that disappeared off the plate quickly. The butterfish was delicate, and the salad was great - the greens had all sorts of different flavors, and not that \"generic clump of lettuce\" flavor I hate.

 From the sushi menu, I was feeling adventurous and had never had raw red meat before, so I ordered the wagyu gunkan. My date saw the amount of green onions piled on top of this dish and oh-so-chivalrously gave me his piece. It's true that you needed a healthy appreciation of green onion to like these as served. The wagyu beef is ground nearly to a puree - which I wasn't expecting, and I thought the onion was a bit much.

 At for the skewers we ordered, my date liked his sweet potatoes the best, but I was partial to the crispy BBQ. These turned out to be two large ovoid and solid shapes of rice, run through with a skewer. Pure white sushi rice in the center, the outside was caramelized with what tasted like the sweet BBQ sauce that comes on eel sushi, which gave the whole thing a nice, crispy shell.

 At this point, I got to what I consider to be the crowning achievement of the meal: the yuzu marinated black cod. The cod, cooked on the robata grill in a leaf, was meltingly soft and delicately flavored. It was an effort to be share fairly. I believe my date said after our first taste of it, \"Just eat what you want and I'll finish ...\",  I looked up from my chopsticks, \"... you know what? Just cut me off half.\"

 I wasn't sure that I could handle dessert after eating so much, but we finally decided it wouldn't be fair not to give the dessert menu a looking over, right? So we ordered the baked green tea custard, and it was a perfect pick after a gut-busting meal. Light and airy, it also had some carbonation to it that tickled my taste buds and made me giggle a lot as I was eating it. 

 Our sampler of shochu ranged from impressive to harsh, at least to my taste buds. In order starting with least harsh: pineapple, honeycomb, raspberry, and apple. I didn't like the last two, but the pineapple was, in my mind, a fairly dangerous thing to drink when you're not paying attention. Smooth.

 That's it for the food, and as for the service, it was swift and considerate; glasses were kept full, and empty plates whisked away. There was, however, one glaring exception that nearly overpowered the entire evening with its oddness. The waiter, who had up till this point been very nice and chatty, helpful about menu items, and generally a pretty cool guy, handed me his phone number and told us to call him any time we wanted to go partying. 

 What am I supposed to do with this? Are we going to call our waiter up and say ... well, what? It flummoxed me."}
{"text":"This place is a good cross over hit.  Took my dad and his wife who aren't haven't ever eaten much Japanese and they loved it.  If you need sushi but are stuck eating with someone who doesn't like sushi then this is the restaurant for you.  

Here are some of the highlights:  scallop appetizer, pork belly appetizer, black cod entrée was delicious.  Also don't miss the buttered mushroom skewers... we cleaned them out while we were there.  Chu-Toro was good but not worth the money."}
{"text":"Well, let me start off with a look of confusion at the exceedingly rave reviews of this dining establishment. (Raised left eyebrow, and a smirk, but you already knew that)

So, initial impressions: Seemed like a confused ambience. Kind of clubish, with a little hubristic haze. The music was the only positive part, reminding me of HGTV's 'Selling New York.'

The waitstaff seemed somewhat confused, as we had 2 waiters at one point, but the bussers were top notch!

We were also sad to hear that the \"Happy hour\" menu was only in the bar.

Now to the food: The menu and the prices associated gave me a bad feeling right quick. I am too used to excellent sushi, at fair prices, as well as happy hour menus with all the favorites. (Especially dragon rolls! YUMZOID!) 

We proceeded to order a couple appetizers, and a handful of rolls. None of which were memorable in any positive light:

 The avocado roll was insipid with a strange clash of textures and flavors. (Soft avocado, and carrot sticks likeyourmompackedinyourbrownbaglunch and a strange dusting of what tasted like bread crumbs...) The spicy tuna had to be the only one that was acceptable, and it was interesting to have chunked tuna vs. the usual frappe. The softshell crab was weak, and the spicy yellow-tail was spicy, but pretty one-note, and not satisfying. 

 ***Bottom line: We decided to pay our bill, and then go straight to one of our favorite sushi spots to satisfy the sushi craving that we definitely missed out on: HIRO sushi. Man, let me tell you, I threw down a D-backs roll and a Crazy roll, and Hiro sushi was indeed the sushi Hero of the day ;)"}
{"text":"A lot of us at Pucci go there for happy hour. They offer some great deals. Definitely try their soft shell crab slider, Incredible. Their food is pricey on the dinner menu but it is as fresh as it comes with great presentation. Go there"}
{"text":"Roka Akor rocks!  Superb high quality of sashimi and robata grill with attentive but not pestering service by modelesque waiters. What else can one ask for?

The grilled scallops were juicy and crispy on the surface, flavored with yuzu paste (Japanese citrus).  

The sashimi platter was out of this world.  Highly marblized toro that they paired with freshly grated Himalayan rock salt, kumamoto oysters, maguro, sweet shrimp, salmon tataki, and butterfish sashimi.  Even the wasabi was freshly grated.  It looked like an expensive masterpiece (thank god our vendor took care of the bill :)).

My miso-glazed black cod was perfectly grilled and creatively presented inside some curved leaf.  

I also heard the kobe beef was good.

And the flight of sake was pretty refreshing as well.

All in all, Roka met every expectation I had. I can still hear my coworkers raving about last night's dinner.  :)"}
{"text":"Expect top quality sushi at a \"top quality sushi\" price.

The hamachi nigiri and yellowtail sashimi were both impeccably prepared and paired with complimentary toppings, and the ratio of fish to rice is about 7:1, which is always refreshing. The unagi roll was a bit chewier than I'm used to, but delicious in it's own right (although the unagi sashimi was definitely better). Even better was the spicy tuna roll - the fish is exceptionally tender. It makes the notion that the same species ends up emanating stench from sandwiches in children's lunch boxes seem impossible. 

The best of the best award goes to the seared sesame salmon nigiri, which is the most melt-in-your-mouth fish experience known to man, as well as the crispy prawn roll, which isn't heavy or fried, but still so deliciously, well... crispy.

Is it worth it? Yes, even though they charge a lot, they don't skimp on the fish, and it'll probably be the best quality sushi you have in Arizona. Would I come here again? Maybe, but only if I get ahold of another Groupon."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite sushi indulgence. I the times I have been there I have yet to sit at the grill area, and I find I enjoy sitting in the lounge much more than the dining room. 
On my last trip there we took some visiting friends from out of town and we knew they would have some budgetary constraints, but we also wanted them to experience Roka. We made reservations for the lounge for 7 people. The staff was very accommodating and worked to keep you happy. Their lounge menu has something for everyone at great prices. We had numerous orders of their sliders (veggie and meat filled), very tasty! Their miso soup is probably the best I have had. I dream of their butterfish tataki and we got many of the folks in our party raving as well. The cocktails are hard to beat. The scene, ambiance, service and quality of food is top notch! I enjoy going as a solo diner for happy hour and the occasional Sunday brunch. 
You also never know who you may see, I have encountered several celebs and on the last visit sat next to Larry David (of Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm fame)."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for the Sushi Master class on Saturday afternoon and left not only knowledgeable, but fat and happy. Class started with mojitos and continued with sake and Japanese beer as we snacked on edamame and calamari and we learned about fileting fish, different types of sushi and sashimi and eventually made our own. We prepared our own butterfish tetaki and California rolls and were served various other sushi and sashimi prepared by the chefs throughout the afternoon. When taking this class DO NOT plan on making dinner plans after because you will be to stuffed to move, let alone eat anything else. Not only is the class a great value for the money but it's a lot of fun and you really learn something new and unique. Roka Akor, you've done it again."}
{"text":"Another trendy sushi resurant and bar.  This one is a lot of fun on the weekends when the place is packed.  The quality of fish is on par with most high end sushi places, and they offer a full list of different Shochu which was a new expereince for me.  I've always enjoyed sake, especially nigori, but have never given Shochu a try.  A lot of it tastes like whisky without the burn.  It's not cheap, but very good, and goes well with the sushi.  I really enjoyed the butterfhish tataki, and recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful recommendations.  My wife and I love maki rolls. Highly recommend the Hamachi Serrano roll."}
{"text":"Omg the food was amazing!!! If you go here you have to try the pork belly. It's so good it melts in your mouth like butter. Reservations are highly recommend. Even on a Wednesday night they were completely booked!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! My boyfriend and I go here all the time for their happy hour! It's amazing food and not too expensive! The chibi burger, ribs and broccoli are great, we get those every time! 

The seating in the bar area gets filled pretty quickly but it is worth the wait or you can get their when they open."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! We came here to celebrate our Nanie's birthday and wanted to sit at the lounge for the happy hour specials. Unfortunately, the lounge is a favorite to a lot of people and therefore sat in the dinning area without any specials. We are happy that this happened because everything we ordered was phenomenal. Nanie had her salmon which was delicious. I had their bone marrow special and loved every bite. Everyone was beyond accommodating and exceeded my expectation when it came to service. We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"I took my bf here for his birthday. Everything was outstanding! I loved the food and the service. Everyone was so nice and polite and made my bf's birthday dinner special. We enjoyed every bite of our meals. Will be back soon! Keep up the good work! : )"}
{"text":"We went here recently to celebrate my fiances new job and to use a Groupon I had purchased a while ago. As it was voted one of the top ten sushi restaurants in America by Bon Apetit, I was very excited to try it. The ambiance was lively and the decor was modern, but I was expecting more of a dim lighting, romantic type setting so I was a little surprised. As for the food, unfortunately I think this place was way over hyped for its sushi at least. 

What we ordered: 

Rock shrimp- big portion but nothing really special. Batter was a little heavier than I prefer for tempura, with a side of spicy mayo it was an okay appetizer. 

Butterfish tataki- this was tasty, butterfish melts in your mouth and the sauce (ponzu?) complemented the fish well. but such a tiny portion :(

Hamachi serrano roll- big chunks of hamachi but in a rather small roll, definitely not enought to fill one person up. It was okay. 

Black cod- Probably my favorite item of the night. Nice big portion of cod, miso marinade was apparent in every bite. Melts in your mouth good. My only gripe is that the skin of the fish melted on to the leaf that they smoke it in so you can't eat it. The skin is the best part!! Size and price wise its comparable to Roy's butterfish, except Roy's gives you a side of rice with their dish.

Uni nigiri- Sweet and good portion. 

Sake salmon nigiri- I didn't think you could ruin this but ours was served warm and oily. So weird, it did not taste like sake salmon at all, maybe we will get the regular salmon next time. 

Ikura nigiri- Fiance had this and said he was pleased, seemed like a generous portion too. 

Buttercream cake with raspberry sherbet- FREE with yelp check in! The cake was not too sweet and the sour raspberry sherbet went well with it. 

The waiter also brought me another dessert, must have misheard me but I think it was a rum cake with tons of walnuts and pecans. The cake was good but I don't like nuts so i can't say I enjoyed it much. 

After a bottle of Sapporo, 50 off with the Groupon, and tip the bill came out to about 75 bucks. We will probably be back for happy hour and to try their steaks and lamb but I didn't think the sushi was anything special. It was definitely fresh but for the price I think I can definitely find better options out here. I'm a fan of Sushi room in Chandler although I think they are also on the pricier side."}
{"text":"This place is just terrible, I had the worse experience this past Saturday, our waiter spilled soy sauce all over my white blazer, and did not say anything about it, until my husband saw it, this guy  just ruined my dinner, and even he and manager  of the restaurant did not try to help me, because of this  I just had to go home instead of  to continue our night. Nasty service!!!!!!!!Never will be back or recommend anybody this bad place!!!!!  Food is also not so good, but overpriced."}
{"text":"A nice atmosphere and good selection. The staff are friendly and attentive. I enjoyed my visit overall. Not a huge selection for kids but my grandkids are not picky eaters so they were content."}
{"text":"Truly Outstanding Sushi and Sashimi fit for a special occasion.
Too pricey to be a regular haunt."}
{"text":"Roka Akor is a chain with locations in Chicagoland (2), San Francisco, and Scottsdale. We've been to this location in the past and it came to mind when we were in the area and thinking of \"ambiance with our sushi.\" And yes, it's a bit higher on the pricing but we were willing to pay above \"hole in the wall\" or \"regular\" sushi price. (And even some of the basic places in the Valley are getting carried away on pricing. Across the country, I've now paid the highest for charashi in Glendale, AZ, and while good it wasn't superior in quality nor quantity to anywhere else.) Anyway, we wanted ambiance and service. 

Ambiance delivers here every time. We enjoy both the bar and the dining room and this evening had opted to for one of their lovely woodgrain tables, overlooking the open kitchen and sushi bar.  We appreciated the host's cordial greeting and seating us at the table of our choosing. 

Our service began and continued fairly, save for a few oversights: new plates delivered while finished plates were left upon the table. We had a break in the service too; servers switching and then our original server stopping back and clearly a bit energetic, \"Did she come and serve you?...\"  While some patrons may not mind this (and myself included sometimes), it broke a moment of our meal. We were talking and enjoying our food so it wasn't good timing nor necessary for him to stop in to let us know that he'd gotten caught up with a large group. It wasn't one of those cases where we were overly chatty with the original server to begin with so it seemed like much ado. I would just prefer that the service align better with the price point and ambiance. I don't mind if servers have to help each other out or what have you, I just prefer that it be approached more seamlessly and perhaps the host had also set a slightly more formal tone, so there was something of a mismatch. 

On to the food...

The butterfish tataki- soft yet firm (ie not mushy); always a winner
Maki - also fresh, rolled tight, flavor-layered and enjoyable: 
   Hamachi Serrano  - yellowtail with a nice light heat from the serrano
   Spicy Tuna - good consistency (never care for mushy spicy tuna) and flavor
   Salmon Avocado - perfect balance of texture and flavor; we detected something \"nutty\" tasting and the server suggested that it may have been the tempura flakes but that seemed unlikely. Never did figure it out so we'll try it again next time. Very good though. 

Cremini mushrooms with soy garlic butter were meaty and hit the spot.

\"Pork ribs\" - I have a background in reality, and there is no realistic way I can justify $23 for an appetizer portion of pork ribs. I'm not certain if they are a \"special\" variety of pork...while flavorful...we didn't taste anything exceptionally succulent about the meat. In fact, a bit tough in places. So pass on those. I hear on good authority that the pork belly is a better direction so we may try that next time!

Ditto the \"pass\" on the \"beef and kimchi\" potstickers. Generally speaking, these were not satisfying to us at any price, (rather mushy and flavorless on the meat) but this batch of 5 were $10. Unfulfilling and not at all filling. 

The sushi and ambiance did not disappoint. A gracious nod and closing greeting from the sushi chef was a nice touch. Likely to and hoping to bump this up to four star after a future visit."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! All the dishes ordered were very well prepared with a beautiful presentation combined with really     great tasting food. Excellent menu with exceptional grilled items from the Robata grill. We enjoyed this restaurant so much that we plan on returning later in the week.  
I strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"What can I say from the entry to our seating I was In Awe! The place has a great atmosphere and perfect noise level. 

I love that I made it out here and found this baby on yelp! I don't mind spending money when the food is good and let me tell you the food is AMAZING!!! 

I started drinking a very rare and expensive saki that made our night start out great. The apps were amazing sashimi and tempura shrimp. When we moved to dinner I had the miso cod and my wife had the Toothfish also know as Seabass but not for chile they get their Seabass from cooler waters. 

Desert was great and the food was better this is a must try! Truly didn't write enough to tell you how great this place was. We had to leave before we could enjoy it again!"}
{"text":"Accidentally posted picture with comments, thinking it was a review.  oops.  If money is no option (business expense it or baller), and you want a solid experience with omg amazing food, this is the place.   Ask for the Roka Fire (ghost pepper sauce) and you will be lit up.  I added some of it to the muscles miso broth, and def one of the best flavors I've ever tasted.  Sushi was great.  Sake bottle 100 bucks and amazing.  Ribs/beef everything tasted as we went family style on this place (8 people and not duplicate orders), was the top dinner experience for most of us, and these sales/marketing people have been everywhere.  Thanks ROKA!!!!"}
{"text":"The Food here is 5 stars for sure. 

The Butterfish Tataki is so wonderful.  I mean really anything with butter in the title has to be good right?  

We ordered the Deluxe Platter for 4 which in my humble opinion is the way to enjoy the sushi and sashimi here because the chef makes it up from what he feels is the best fish that day. Trust me you will be knocking your friends chop sticks out of the way to get that last bite.

The only reason for the 4 stars was the slow service and they were kind of rude about it.  However food this good gets my vote for another trip to Roka."}
{"text":"The best, most knowledgeable & friendly wait staff (thanks Eugene) & a genuinely involved general manager, Angelo. Sushi was as if right out of the sea. If available, try the maitake mushrooms with truffle butter. Best uni I've ever had. Beautiful restaurant with a great happy hour menu, 4 - 7. A more lively atmosphere than ShinBay & a totally different menu."}
{"text":"once your ears and eyes have recovered from over-stimulation by way of too-loud music, waiters who can barely hear you, strange lighting, and fancy filled vases, take care of your taste buds:

- skip the cooked food, it's over-salty and over-priced
- fresh sashimi was awesome. extra props to Roka for including o-toro and chu-toro on our platter!
- sit at the robata grill. friendly smiles = friendly service (and extra food!)
- don't be fooled by $4.50 edamame.
- drink lots of water (for all that salt!)

then hug your fellow diner for keeping you company, and rub your tummy for good luck (and digestion)."}
{"text":"There certainly is no shortage of good sushi in the Scottsdale area. For a location in the middle of the desert, you would think that it would be tough to get fresh seafood in this area, but these area restaurants figure out how to make it happen.

The freshness was certainly one of the highlights of Roka Akor. i started with two sashimi dishes, the Butterfish Tataki and the Hirame Kombu Jime. The butterfish was light, smooth and surprisingly flaavorful, with a nice citrus twist. The Hirame, a type of fluke, had a tougher texture, was still very fresh, but didn't quite have the depth of flavor exibited by the butterrfish.

Several dishes were sampled for the main course. Much like other high-end steakhouses, the dishes come a-la-carte. The Black Cod and the 12oz Ribeye were ordered with a side of the cremini mushrooms. The flavors were certainly good, but didn't quite exhibit the high-end quality you would expect from a restaurant of this calibur. On a positive side, the texture of the Cod was exceptional. The steak was a little too fatty, even for ribeye and unfortunately hampered the texture of the dish.

On a slight negative note was the quantity of the food. For around $60 per person, I left hungry. It likely had more to do with the types of dishes I ordered than necessarily the restaurant itself. Sashimi always comes in small quantities, but I would have hoped that the main courses or side dishes come with a little more. The experience was positive, though not overwhelmingly so. It had a pleasant atmosphere, mediocre service and descent food.

[Edit] After some thought, I will be willing to give it another shot, possibly for a happy hour. I'll post another edit once I try it again."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi.  Try the robata grill for a deviation from the average.  Sitting at the bar is fun and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wagyu bone marrow on squid ink brioche.... I shouldn't have to keep writing. You need this in your life. The scallops and the Butterfish  tataki were fun and tasty. The Brussel sprouts were surprisingly good. Atmosphere is nice. Why are you still reading? I said bone marrow and squid ink in the same sentence! Go eat it! You're welcome."}
{"text":"Such a good meal. Recently, I brought an out of town co-worker here for dinner. For apps, we ordered edamame and the fried brussel sprouts with ponzu. Really good apps. She and I were tearing up the brussel sprouts. 

For dinner, we ordered the pork belly, tempura prawns and butterfish, scallops roll, and the soft shell crab roll. My scallops roll was okay to me but I think it was just my tastes. All in all, I really enjoyed the food. I also had the mojito with papaya I think...it was bright pink and delicious!

I brought home the pork belly leftovers and my husband was in love...he wants to go back ASAP!"}
{"text":"This is a place that you should NOT look at the prices and enjoy the meals.  The quality of food is very high so you will definitely get the best meals here.  Expect French portion for their food so you will probably walked out hungry after spending close to $50-75/person for your meal.  I didn't get to enjoy everything I wanted so next time I will go for Okamase (Chef Choice) menu and see what they can turn out for $125/head.  I was slightly disappointed with the trash they put in the parking lot which was an eyesore.  I believe they no longer open for lunch.  They ran out of Uni and some of the real stuff that I like but I did get to enjoy the seasoned mushroom which is a rare treat even in Japan.  I'll return for another review after a big paycheck from work next time."}
{"text":"For our last dinner in Scottsdale, we chose Roka Akor. We've heard great things about this place...especially their happy hour menu. As soon as we sat down at their lounge, we were greeted by a cute bartender named Leigh that was really friendly...she congratulated us on our anniversary and had some good recommendations for us. We went a little crazy and order drinks and 8 dishes to try on their HH menu. My favorites were the shishito peppers and the hamachi rolls. Their yakitoris were good too. We could chosen other places to eat but I'm glad my BF chose this place. It has a great menu and beautiful decor, but I think what made our meal even better was the fact that Leigh was so sweet. She even asked the chef to create a little dessert fruit plate to celebrate our last night in Scottsdale that made our last impressions of Arizona so great!!"}
{"text":"love this place but if you are going for Oyster night be prepared to be unhappy if you go past 6-6:30....sorry we're out...."}
{"text":"Really nice quality sushi and fried. Very excellent service. Unknown Japanese beer terrific. A value for quality and service. Five stars except for reception busy training new staff."}
{"text":"A very impressive quality of sushi and sashimi! I was highly satisfied!The price is more expensive but the quality of the food is superb. They have the best ama Ebi Nigiri in the town! The shrimp is so sweet and the sushi is superb. Tried their 3 sashimi chef collections and all fish (salmon, tuna and white fish) are number 1 quality. So fresh!  Did also dabble in a couple not sashimi style sushi.Got to try their unique crispy rice BBQ with soy sauce too as it looks like a corn dog. And their roka akor cherrano chili roll is impressive!
For the non sushi person, they offer plenty to choose from as well, yakasoba noodles, Robata grilled skewers and entrees to mention.
Also offer an extensive sake menu,specialty drinks and Shochu infusions. I had a Saketini.  Great place for lunch, dinner and happy hours!"}
{"text":"Worst food experience I've had in long time...this is my first 1 star rating.  Every dish we order was wrong or terrible.  Almost half of the steak was fat and non edible.  Just trying to hard....Over priced period!!!!  Stay away from this place.  Better off going to place like Sakana or Yasu and pay fraction of the price for great food."}
{"text":"ok finally went back to roka last night and im speechless im not sure if it was the amazing service by the GM Joy or one of the greatest servers ive ever had Casey.  They sat us in a small table in the back corner which was great.  When i came in i knew everything i wanted to order but that soon changed after casey started to tell me about their specials.  We ordered the rock shrimp tempura which is half the price as what we are used to  paying at NOBU in LA and 10000 times better here at roka.  Next came this scallop flamed seared with king crab avocado and who knows what else see the pictures every bite was pure happiness.   Casey helped us to decide on some great sashimi selections.  The salmon sashimi there is out of this world its hard to explain that a piece of fish in the AZ desert is fresher than anything ive ever had in LA or NYC. But it was!  then came our steak i wish we had went for the a3 waygu but my GF decided to only have the filet.  Here again who would believe that steak at roka akor is BETTER than at masteros or Morton's.  The steak melts in your mouth its unbelievable  Im not a big fan of desert but this huge desert platter was served for my GFs birthday.  And im sure i was eating what other reviewers called the \"snozberry\" i hate coconut everything but found myself eating it all i couldn't stop!  January is Steak month at roka so we will be back shortly and if i can ever find the time i would love to do the sushi classes.  Bottom line thank you Joy for changing our minds and if you want a server who will give even the best foodies a run of their knowledge ask for CASEY!  

OH and anyone who complains about the price get real this is some of the best food you will have and the prices are 1/3 what you will pay in LA or NYC with food that is out of this world delicious"}
{"text":"Was here for a Social Media Day happy hour, and it was pretty darn good. Sushi is fresh and flavorful, and their specialty drinks are excellent. I would like to come back for an actual meal. :)"}
{"text":"Updating my review to reflect their Thursday Special - $1 oysters all day! and they are some of the best oysters I've ever eaten in my life"}
{"text":"This is nice restaurant to take your date or anyone else you want to impress. You do pay for the atmosphere and great service though. The food is also delicious and has great presentation but the portion size is small. They also offer valet service."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I dined at Roka Akor on a Friday evening.  The manager, Angelo, has the place running great!  Our server, Jesse, created a dining experience for us that was delicious with dishes ranging from raw sushi to masterfully-cooked prawn to a palette-cleansing dessert. We definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Do I even need to write a review after all the raving comments here? Maybe not, but I feel like my dining experience will be complete when I officially give Roka Akor props for such a fantastic meal. 

Lots of veggie options is a must for me, which is why I was so excited by their menu. While they only have one veggie roll - which is more delicious that any veggie roll I've ever eaten - they have so much more. From the burnt tomato salad to the butternut squash tempura....throw in a few broccolini and asparagus skewers and this veg head was in veg heaven. Beautiful presentation, beautiful flavors. I love the mesquite taste the food takes from the robata. My omnivore companions were drooling over their sushi and we were all floored by the rice hot pot. So many mushrooms! 

The removal of one star was due to the unfavorable attitude of the hostess - Honey, I'm not here to spend $50 on a meal and dine in a way that is convenient for you. Thanks for finally giving in and seating us outside at 9pm when the weather was gorgeous. Why did we have to insist when the patio was still open and all the tables were set?

No matter - our experience with her was done in a jiffy. I think I'm still high on truffle oil and enokis or something, cuz I want to go again - like tonight."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place with my family while we were on vacation in the area. We are all foodies, have been to many upscale restaurants in the country and even in the world. I can safely say this is one of the best restaurants I've been to. Here's why:

First off, the atmosphere was great. It wasn't too loud, but it was energetic and full of life. However, this is not the place for you if you are looking for a completely quiet restaurant. The decoration of the restaurant and how it looked off the first glance was gorgeous. What I liked most about the restaurant was that it can be fun for a couple going out for a drink to hang out in the lounge, or a group of friends, but also for a family looking to have a nice family dinner.
Second, the service was fantastic. Our waiter was incredibly kind, helpful and kept up with the atmosphere. He went above and beyond what the job description of a waiter is. He made suggestions on the menu, was very quick to remove plates and check on the table, etc. And finally, the food was the best part. For small plates (appetizers) we got a lot of the dishes to share, such as the pork belly, charred salmon, squid and bone marrow. Everything was delicious. For the main courses we all got either the skirt steak, the ribeye with Wafu sauce or the filet. The food was beautifully presented and everything was flavorfoul, but not overbearing. I wouldn't say anything was too salty, or too anything. Finally, for desert we had the hazelnut bon-bon, the warm chocolate cake and some of the mochi. Now, in a lot of upscale restaurants the food will be great up until the dessert. I have witnessed this many times. But here, the dessert was the perfect finish to a perfect meal. It was clear that it was made as much of an effort on as the rest of the food. I personally ordered the hazelnut bon-bon and thought it was fantastic.

Overall, I would 100% recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun dinner with family, friends, or even just to hang out in the lounge and have a drink."}
{"text":"So I found this place is one of the best new sushi places in America.  The sushi here is pretty amazing for being in an area with no oceans or fishes swimming or walking around.  The only catch here is they will rape you wallet until there is nothing left take.  The service here is very good and I will definitely go back when I win the lottery.  If you want to get laid listen to Ryan Lochte and take all your first dates to a sushi restaurant.  JEAH!  (i am expecting to lose yelp friends for this one)  xoxo"}
{"text":"They have a great menu selection... and when I went there we tried out their Happy Hour Specials which were fantastic, and certainly gave us a better price point

If your in the area, you should visit this place, but make sure you have money in the bank before you walk in here :) because you will have the urge to try many items out."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing. The service was pretty good. A little forced with their manners and courtesy but they tried and were attentive. Very young and maybe even a little inexperienced staff. However; the food made up for anything that could be construde as a negative! The atmosphere was also nice. A little too bright inside I thought. We ordered based on the waiter's recommendation, the lobster tempura which was $68 but so delicious!! Presentation was incredible on everything. The tempura asparagus was a great compliment to our beef entrees. My friend ordered the Japanese Wagyu meat which is highly exclusive and was priced at $10 and oz. So amazing though we both had some and thought it was worth it! They served it with two salt dishes, a black lava salt and white truffle and they accented the flavor perfectly. I ordered the filet that came with a chili ginger sauce. Also delicious! The meal was amazing, presentation and serveware was beautiful. Their wine list really surprised us. We did have to correct the bill at the end as they charged us $130 for a bottle of Roar which was featured on the menu for $90. This would be a place you could take your girlfriend for her birthday or someone you want to really impress. Best Japanese food I've ever had, hands down!"}
{"text":"I second everything Max A said. 

This isn't my type of place, although I didn't feel out of place here. I'm sure their target audience is a much more refined sort of person, with alot of expendable income. Plenty of \"suits\" came in, while I was partaking of delicious fare at the bar. 

This place borders on \"stuffy\" when you see so many suits scattered around. It's almost like a hush-hush library vibe. Would one dare to laugh exuberantly here, or would you fear being shushed? 

Don't get me wrong. The decor and atmosphere are gorgeous. Presentation is top-notch. The food is delicious and offers a new dining experience - atleast it did for me. 

If you go, you MUST try the glass maze, made of shochu, lychee juice and ylang-ylang. It may be the ONLY reason I'd come back. That's not to say anything else is sub-par or bad. It's just, like I said before, not my type of place. Not even for a special occasion. I don't know. I get the feeling this place will be successful, though, considering the \"type\" of patrons I saw here. We even saw a Hillary Clinton look-alike in the bathroom. Not even a nod of acknowledgment. Not even a terse flip of the upper lip to feign indifference. Well then. I guess she didn't find my Paul Frank St. Patrick's Day shirt to be cute. 

I wonder, though, if i weren't among Yelpers, if the service would have been as great? I wonder if I would have been treated with indifference and an air of causality reserved for house cats? Well, since I can't vouch for that (I only got the impression it would happen), I will give Roka Akor 4 stars. (I'm feeling generous after the Yelp event.)"}
{"text":"This is the second year we have dined here for Thanksgiving and were looking for something other than turkey.  Michael was our server and could not have been better.  The food is so well put together and perfectly cooked. Hubby enjoyed the black cod and I dined on Australian lamb chops. We had kimchi dumplings and ginger and sesame brocollini.  Don't miss the rice hot pot - one order serves two easily.  For dessert, he had pecan pie with sesame ice cream.  Now, this is not your mothers sticky, sickeningly sweet pecan pie.  This was toasted to perfection and not too sweet.  I had a coconut creme brulee with a tart sorbet (sorry, can't remember the fruit).  So incredibly good.  The drinks were refreshing and perfectly made.  This restaurant is a keeper, for sure."}
{"text":"Always amazing!  Excellent mix of Japanese and contemporary. Both food, decorations, service!"}
{"text":"I have read most of the reviews on this place. First thing someone whom is interested in this location needs to do is use common sense: it is in a higher end area of Scottsdale; everything will cost a bit more.

Having said that: you do pay for what you get. The food was exquisite. From the edemame to the scallops, the sashimi to the spicy tuna roll: everything was just a cut above your regular sushi place.

You can enjoy steak as well as a bevy of cooked foods, not just the traditional sushi.

Overall, it was a fantastic experience. The price is high, but the taste you will enjoy will be equally as high."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner!  We had an early seating (5:30 on a Saturday night) so the restaurant was pretty empty when we got there.  As a result, service was very attentive.  We ordered a little bit of everything off their different headings.  We got the mushroom rice pot, the pork belly, chef's sashami, sweet corn skewers, chicken yakitori, one of the grilled entrees and dessert.  Everything was fantastic with the exception of the grilled corn.  It was SOOOO salty that it was inedible.  I mentioned it to our server and he just brushed it off - didn't offer to not charge me for it or bring me something else.  But because the rest of the meal was pretty good, I'm still giving it 4 stars."}
{"text":"WOW....I don't give 5 stars away too often....but this place deserves it.  Top notch food...excellent service and the décor was hip... yet classy.  Lets talk food - Appetizer ; Pork Belly with golden beets.  The pork belly basically melted in mouth..most likely braised then finished off on the grill for that outer texture  . The golden of beets complimented the pork belly perfectly. Entrée -  I ordered the miso black cod.  This clearly stole the show.  My wife had cod envy all night.  It was so good, I started making it at home regularly.  The wife had another fish dish which she enjoyed (may have been salmon)....just not as much as my black cod.  For a cocktail, I had an old fashion...too bad I was driving or I would have ordered another.  Hands down best old fashion I ever had. Now the best part of the meal was I had a groupon.  It must be a seasonal thing cause groupon doesn't normally have restaurants of this caliber.  Great food, service and ambiance!"}
{"text":"Quality and first class service is what makes Roka Akor what it is.  I was impressed with their selections at a Yelp event, and they gave a coupon for free appetizer.  I decided to check it out tonight.  From the moment I walked in to moment I walked out, there was ultimate care from every person.  I must have been asked how was I was doing at least 20 times throughout the evening.  In addition, my tea cup and soy sauce was automatically refilled before I knew it.  They treated my friend and I as though were were regulars, which felt great.

The food quantity was smaller, but it was delicious.  We had a scallop type appetizer, spicy tuna rolls, and prawn roll.  I have never had prawn roll and it was quite excellent.

At the end of my meal, the Matrie D gave him his business card if I wanted to set up a special evening in the future with reservations.  I simply have never been given this much care and treatment ever while dining."}
{"text":"Happy hour menu is extensive and amazing. Perfect for a light nosh and not too pricey. So so good!!"}
{"text":"Butterfish tataki, chicken yakitori, kobi beef and kimchi dumplings, black cod, vegetable sides of grilled sweet potato and sweet corn are all excellent.
Must try their ice creams or sorbets for dessert, especially the autumn chocolate (chocolate, cinnamon, cardamom)."}
{"text":"Bomb.com! This place is amazing. They have one of the best menus in the Phoenix metro!"}
{"text":"Great Ambiance! Great Food! Great Service! Splendid Experience! Totally Recommend!

+ Sushi: Fantastic
+ Robata: Excellent

I'm just glad an International venue such as Roka reside in AZ! Go check them out!"}
{"text":"If not for the excellent salmon entree and sushi, this would have only been a one-star review.  As we entered, my wife had thoughts about leaving, due to the cheap and clashing decor.  Too bad we didn't leave.  We told the waiter it was our first time, expecting him to roll out the red carpet.  All he said was, \"the specials are all marked in the menu\" ... thanks for nothing.  Then he disappeared for the rest of the night, leaving us to flag down other staff for refills.  In such a competitive restaurant market, I'm amazed how this place stays afloat.  The food is excellent, so if you don't mind an inhospitable staff and a tacky diner-type atmosphere, you might as well go here."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for over a couple years now. Have had nothing but great food and awesome service. You will not go wrong here at all. Had my first issue here but had nothing to do with the food or service, just a bank charge issue which happens from time to time. Sent them a private message through Yelp, and the response back from the owner was fast and very helpful. The owner also called me back a couple days later, just to follow up again. First class I must say, this is why this restaurant is dialed in and such a great experience, because owners and staff such as these guys. If you are looking for a great place to frequent look no further, you will not go wrong here. Once again great food, staff and ambiance, which will make for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Great service! Delicious dessert, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am not happy about the service, the waitress seemed absent minded. The sashimi is not fresh. I used my groupon and will not return. Not a repeat guest."}
