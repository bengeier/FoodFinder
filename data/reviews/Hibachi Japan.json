{"text":"Fun for the family but the taste has a lot to be desired! Next time we'll try some sushi and see what all the fuss is about."}
{"text":"It's not real Japanese food.  We ordered Yakitori. It was just chicken, no yummy sauce.  It's just ok over all."}
{"text":"Parents bought a new house near here, so this is their local hibachi. Went with my dad who is pretty critical, and he ordered the sushi (including salmon & shrimp) and devoured it. I had the Filet (since he was paying!), my mum had the chicken and daughter had shrimp. The sauces were pretty good (a light mustard seafood sauce & soy/sesame sauce), but I was looking for a little more spice. The cook did less showboating than I am use to, but overall it was a nice last night before I returned home. I would go again."}
