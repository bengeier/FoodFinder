{"text":"Wow, this is a real gem. My wife and I saw the signage up for several months before it opened, and our curiosity was piqued. Once it opened, we promptly visited, and boy, we were very satisfied.

This location has seating for 20. A flatscreen TV with CP24 was on, and was a nice touch. The decor is simple and iconic. Red is the colour, which is simple and bold, and goes along nicely with their billboards.

We ordered Reuben sandwiches, with Montreal smoked meat. We took the employees advice and got cherry drinks. Our food took about 8 minutes to prepare. The sandwiches were wonderfully crafted. The cheese was nicely \"sandwiched\" between the huge mound of meat. The pickle was so saturated in colour and flavor. The macaroni salad we got on the side was great as well. Pasta done al dente. Only change I would do; get the small salad instead of the large. My eyes were bigger than my stomach.

The sandwich was love at first bite. There was definite substance to the sizzle. The bread was perfectly toasted. The meat was perfectly moist, and the cheese melted just so. The hot mustard available to add is truly icing on the cake. Wouldn't change a thing. Very satisfying. 

Since then, have gone back several times, and it remains consistently great. Highly recommend. Check out this amazing place!"}
{"text":"Found this place while walking around waiting for the oil change to be done to the car. Saw a green pass sign and thought why the heck not!

I was greeted instantly with a smiling face and some good options. I'm a classic kinda gal so I ordered the classic. The gentlemen was friendly and when I mentioned we would be eating in, he said he loves the company in his store. He just gave off a good vibe so I was excited to try his food. The place is just your basic hole in the wall establishment. But, lets get to the food!

The food was pretty good. Now I have never had a official Montreal smoked meat sandwich but this one was really good. It has just the right amount of mustard and meat. The pickle spears were just delicious as well, super juicy! I can see myself coming back here if I ever have a hankering for smoked meat."}
{"text":"Seeing a Montreal-style deli open in Scarborough certainly piqued my interest, so the other week I found myself coming here to test it out for lunch. 

The restaurant is located on Warden Ave just south of Eglinton in a mainly industrial part of Scarborough.  I walked in for a late lunch and the place was about half full, the restaurant is bright and very clean. The menu is classic Montr√©al deli fare; smoked meat, roast beef, chicken, turkey, poutine, steamies etc. One impressive thing on the menu was that they have 8 different kinds of grilled Reubens. I was here for smoked meat though, I got mine on rye with a side of fries and coleslaw (ran me about $11 with no drink). I took a seat and waited for my number to be called. 

The sandwich itself although large was a bit disappointing. The rye was piled fairly high with smoked meat; the meat had a decent peppery flavour but was sliced too thin, it was clearly not hand cut. The meat being sliced that thin reminded me of the smoked meat you get at the deli counter in the super market. The hot mustard served on the sandwich added a nice kick; the rye bread was very soft. The sides definitely outshined the sandwich, the fries were fresh cut and quite delicious although they could have benefitted from being a little more crunchy. The coleslaw was creamy but balanced off with just enough vinegar. 

Overall the food here is probably a 2.5 star experience, I will bump them up to a three because the girl working behind the counter was very friendly and had no qualms about offering her opinion about the menu items. This place is definitely a one of a kind in Scarborough but is far from the best smoked meat in GTA."}
{"text":"Way to many black little flys all over the place! Walked in and noticed the flys and walked out! All was near cash and garbage."}
{"text":"Was a customer of this spot since it opened.  Last year was back in town and made a point to get some large smoked meat sandwiches for takeout back to my hotel room..  They were pathetic and certainly do not match up with their advertising or what I was used to.  No response from their team.... done with you folks......"}
