{"text":"Wonderful! Fast, super tasty, feta fries are crunchy and greeky, pizza is loaded, delivery before time in my case, and complimentary desert for two. You know what, I'll call back again! Please keep your services as they are!"}
{"text":"Ordered pork gyro, greek salad with chicken, kids pizza. Gyro was delicious does not need the fries added to it. Salad was fresh and kids pizza surprisingly delicious . We ordered to go first time here. Staff is so courteous making sure you have everything you need even gave us rice pudding to try for free and helped me out to my car. Will definitely be back. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service! The chicken gyro is the best! My son can not stop raving about Akropolis!"}
{"text":"SO STOKED to have found this OUTSTANDING Pizza & real meat\"Greek Style\" Gyro's (not pressed wanna be meat w/fillers)!  Not only is the food absolutely delicious the staff (including Brooke, Paul & Owner) hospitality and customer service superior to any others in town.  We ordered the house special pizza & buffalo chicken which were both fantastic (my husband rarely likes take out pizza but we were busy w/a house project and decided to give this high \"Yelp\" rated establishment go and were beyond pleased!!  We also sampled a Chicken gyro (marinated meet so tasty), spanakopita & rice pudding (to die for) which were all exquisite.....craving their good eats & plan to go get some really soon!  Its a little tricky to find right by the newer Natural Grocers next to convenience store.  I highly suggest trying this terrific little establishment.........with enormous flavors (you won't regret it)!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best gyro in LV! These guys are authentic, not some chain joint. Food was perfect, exactly what I hoped for. Cant wait to try their pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, food, and prices. Chicken Gyro was delicious and side salad was super fresh!"}
{"text":"Everything about our meal and service was great!!! Big portions tasty food exceptional service . Don't miss it if you are in the area ."}
{"text":"The food is made fresh with good portions. I had the pork gyro and was pleased with the quality."}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome service! All the guys there are pretty awesome & friendly! 
I like the pork gyro!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from them for a late lunch and was pleasantly surprised at how fresh my food was! My boss recommended this restaurant months ago and after visiting several other places, it was their turn. I had the Greek Salad with Caesar dressing, Akropolis Feta Fries and Dolmades. The Greek salad is large and everything was very fresh and yummy, I split it in half for dinner or snack lol. The fries were delicious and topped with a great amount of feta, which I love. I haven't tried the dolmades yet but they look tasty. Not only was my food excellent, I ordered through the yelp eat app and the establishment delivered the food 20 minutes before it was slated to arrive and with a smile! 

Must try! Worth there 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Oh my! 1st off, all the staff is awesome and 2nd the gyros and akropolis fries are amazingggg! The tzatziki sauce is delicious! Can't wait to try ALL the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"First time trying and definitely ordering again! Ordered a lg pepperoni pizza and a lg buffalo chicken pizza. Very good taste cheesy just how I love my pizza. Also ordered a caesar salad it was a good portion for two maybe three people.  Cant wait to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Yummy. This place delivered to our hotel when we were staying at the Hampton inn in Henderson for a soccer tournament. The food was amazing! Fast delivery and something for everyone"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! We had an order delivered & will be a repeat customer now! Nice customer service, delivery arrived when they said it would, and food was amazing! We had a cheese pizza, gyro plater, fries, & rice pudding. All was flavorful & well made."}
{"text":"I stopped by here randomly for lunch and decided to order a chicken gyro. Now i'm someone that loves greek pita and greek seasoned meat, but i'm not a fan of tzatziki. I know, shame. ;( so i set about ordering my gyro without veggies, without sauce, no feta (i know, right? I'm ridiculous), then added shredded mozz and a side of buffalo.
Wow, great buffalo sauce! They didn't even blink or argue, made it how i wanted and it was fantastic. Really, i think it should be on the menu, buffalo chicken gyro. :D
At the end of my meal, they let me sample some rice pudding. Mild, slightly sweet with accents of cinnamon. It was a refreshing dessert to end the meal with.  Delicious, thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time after craving Greek food. By far the best Greek food I've ever had. The owners are very friendly, provide great service, and even help with deciding what to order if you're not familiar with Greek food. On top of that, they threw in drinks and baklava free! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. We both had chicken gyros. They were delicious and I appreciate the extra sauce. The fries were amazing my wife said \"I think these might be the best fries I've ever had in my life.\" We're a little snobby about food but this place is incredible. I'll be back! And great customer service."}
{"text":"There's a reason this restaurant has 5 stars.  Excellent food and great service.  I've been to Greece, and this is the best gyro I've had since.  The chicken and pork is fresh and flavorful, not processed.   Sizes were generous."}
{"text":"I had the pork gyro and homemade rice pudding and both were delicious! Everything was very flavorful and authentic. The entire staff was extremely nice and very helpful too with offering suggestions! The service was very fast, restaurant kept very clean, and the nice atmosphere with several neat Greek photos on the walls make this place a great place to stop for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Really cool place for casual dining located in a tiny plaza. Love their Gyro Combo and the fries were good and crispy."}
{"text":"Honestly the most authentic Greek gyro in Las Vegas. Their pork is so good and flavorful, we had to go for seconds! The staff was so friendly and warming that we ended up talking for 2 hours! Definitely great to see that they are in town and a new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but service was even better. Will definitely be back when in the area. The chicken gyro and Athenian pizza were both excellent. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've tried the Chicken Gyro, Hummus, Tzatziki and the Spanakopita and all of it has been delicious, fresh and authentic. The Chicken Gyro comes with fires inside (unique twist) but very good. Red Pepper Hummus, Tzatziki and Spanakopita were on point, wouldn't change a thing! Have become a repeat, loyal customer! Don't hesitate, try them out!!"}
{"text":"The delicious pork gyro platter and warm customer service are the inspiration for my first yelp review.  Blown away with every bite, something that rarely happens with my self proclaimed discerning (picky) palate.  

- Fresh and crisp vegetables
- Well balanced Greek vinaigrette  
- Super soft pita
- Flavorful and tender pork
- Crispy and light (vs heavy/oily) seasoned fries
- Creamy and bright tzatziki

* Bonus points for friendly and efficient customer service, extra napkins and a 2-bite check"}
{"text":"Addicted! Must have once a week at least! Never had anything not great from here ever! And the people whom work here are nothing but phenomenal! Dine in or delivered....they are all awesome people!"}
{"text":"***updated***
My husband liked it so much, he went back an hour after this was posted, ha! Twice in one day. The Akropolis pizza is really good and the crust is my favorite part. I knew we would be back just not a few hours later haha. It's excellent 

Couldn't be happier that I finally tried this place! Had a crazy craving for a Cheesesteak and it did not disappoint! So delish and the chicken gyro lunch combo is so perfect. We literally live .3mi away, so we will be here a lot. Cannot wait to try everything else on the menu. The staff is amazing too! So very welcoming. Must try!! You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"So good. My family has been there several times and they are always so nice.. they are genuinely thankful to the customers. The food is delicious. Tzatziki sauce is home made and authentic...the gyros are beautifully done, pizza, wings, and subs (that bread is amazing). My kids love everything there. Keep up the good work Akropolis - we appreciate you!"}
{"text":"The Strombolli was amazing and it was huge.  The dough of the Strombolli reminded me how pizza taste in Youngstown/Pittsburgh.  A lot better than out here.  The fries are good.  The rice pudding was also good.  And the service over the top, impeccable."}
{"text":"I don't typically eat Greek food, but out of all the Greek restaurants I have been to, out here in Vegas, this is definitely my favorite. I ordered the chicken Gyro and it was far more flavorful and juicy than any other Gyro I have had out here...actually, it is the best Gyro I have had from anywhere. I also got the Feta fries, which were also delicious. The staff is super friendly...I called and they explained the whole menu to me, along with answering all questions that I had. They appear to be super-knowledgeable and know what they are doing. Keep it up!! I will definitely be back to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Best service ever! Seriously, I haven't had customer service like that in a while . Whatever I did not finish they bagged up for me and he even walked back to my car . He is very attentive  make sure I was okay  and offered the Wi-Fi  password to me since i was in the middle of booking a plane ticket. I tried to make change to give them a tip  but they would not accept the money . I had the pork gyro and he explained to me why they don't have the lamb and beef gyro. The akropolis fries were seasoned just right and it comes with a yummy sauce to dip . They gave me a nice portion of rice pudding,  complimentary. I also had a side Greek salad that came with a tasty in house made dressing. I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Always great service, the food is just another type of good. Bomb.com as I like to say. I give it five stars, no questions asked!! Oh and those Akropolis fries with the feta cheese and the lemon!!! YUUMM!!!"}
{"text":"I use to order the Philly Cheese Steak from Super Pizza.  I was a little worried when the changed to Greek but the food is even more amazing.  The still serve the best Cheese steak in Vegas.  The spanakopita is delicious.  The pizza is to die for loads of fresh ingredients and huge.  A large can feed two families!!! My daughter loves the fingers and fries.  Oh and I almost forget rice pudding is sooo good.

The employees offer great customer service!! Delivery is fast food is always hot!

My family orders at least once a week. Try it you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Wow great pizza, awesome gyros, amazing service. What can you say, definitely a hole in the wall but if you are craving pork or chicken gyros, spinach pies, fresh salads and a family atmosphere this is the place to eat. Did i mention the refreshing rice pudding?"}
{"text":"Excellent. Absolutely excellent. The food, the ambiance and the customer service are fantastic, you definitely want to have your pizza from here. 

*Akropolis staff, please dont change your ways and the quality of your food and we'll keep on coming."}
{"text":"The best chicken and pork souflaki gyros in Las Vegas with traditional yummy ingredients .Everyone must enjoy this nice and clean place .Don't forget to order the spanakopita which are perfect for kids . Also the greek salad is delicious in every time of the day . Can't wait for the next stop ."}
{"text":"I just returned from Greece a few weeks ago and had a house party with the others on the trip.  I checked Yelp for a recommendation for good Greek food in Henderson, I'm so happy I did!  I found AKROPOLIS!  We had AKROPOLIS fries, Spanakopita, Tyropita, Hummus, Greek salad, Gyros. AKROPOLIS pizza, Athenian Pizza,rice pudding and of course...baklava!  Everything was seriously good, everyone loved it!  I met the owners when I ordered and enjoyed hearing stories of their homelands and seeing the photo covered walls.  I could not recommend the experience any higher!"}
{"text":"Thought I would try the pizza since they have the cup and char pepperoni - mmmmmm very yummy.  Pizza could be a little thinner but taste was very good.  We also tried the chicken finger.  Nice and moist and tasty.  Will order again.  (next time remind me to try the rice pudding!)"}
{"text":"This new business is doing the right things. The food is fresh and delicious. The service is outstanding, with the owner, I believe, checking on me to see if I liked the food and talking about his native country and the types of food they use. He even gave me an appetizer for free to try. I was hesitant at first to get it since I was already getting the lunch special. He then said he would give me a small plate, which was so nice of him. I got the pork gyo. It was delicious. The only thing I would change is to ask for a little less of the white sauce. I'm not sure what it is, but those are my taste buds since I like things more simple. I'm picky about fries and usually don't get them because it's too much. However, I don't regret getting their fries. They were really good and nice and very crispy. I look forward to going back and might try the pizza. The way how he described it made it sound delicious."}
{"text":"If u ever wanna taste greek food u got to stop at the Akropolis is the best place  with authentic Greek food!!!great customer service and hospitality!they deliver as well!!!"}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars. I've eaten here twice now. First time, I got the pork gyro platter. The side salad is fresh and crisp, with red onion, diced tomatoe, feta, and an olive as expected. The pork gyro was basically bacon. I got a fatty, yet crispy portion. It came out in crumbles instead of slices. The rice is cooked in their house broth. For me the food was great, but incredibly SALTY towards the end of it. As a caveat, I have a more salt sensitive palate then most Americans. 

For lunch, I got the chicken gyro combo. They put French fries in gyro; great add, especially if your drinking. The chicken was DRY, but the tzatziki sauce made up for it. Their tzatziki sauce is great. I love it. The hummus reminds me of Saba hummus from the grocery store. The pita bead is the typical thin pita, toasted lightly. 

The dine in experience. Order at the front counter. Seating area is a little cramped. They'll bust your table for you even though they served everything in to go boxes for dine in. 

Overall its good food and service for a fair price. Greek Bistro and Great Greek have a new contender to deal with."}
{"text":"Wow this place was so good! Cheap and delicious! The staff was amazing as well. I really felt like they cared if we were enjoying it. Gave us free rice pudding to try too- it was delicious! My husband got a margarita pizza and I got the gyro plate. The chicken and rice- so good!! We're definitely going here again. Best Greek place I've been to in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"Visited this place and it was really good. Only eaten here twice and it's just as amazing as the first time. I highly recommend this place if you haven't tried it already!"}
{"text":"Wonderful homemade scratch cooked food, large portions and friendly service. The kids meal portions are very generous. We had the chicken gyros, kids cheese pizza, Greek salad, dalmas and fresh pita. Everything was well prepared and flavorful. The restaurant was clean and easy casual seating."}
{"text":"Just ordered 2 cheesecake and a salad... those cheesteaks are the real deal. Super delicious!! They also delivered it to my house super fast and brought me a complimentary desert. I will defiently become a regular. Good job guys:)"}
{"text":"Great service! Family owned restaurant. We walked in and right away felt like our comfort and food preferences were being considered. My husband was handed the remote for their TV. The portions were generous. And more importantly the food was tasty. Tzatziki was delicious. Pork gyro and chicken gyro on point. Fries were crisp on the outside n soft on the inside, and they give huge to-go containers of condiments. Salad was very fresh and their dressing options were surprising varied. The gyro platter wasn't what I expected and when I pointed it out they immediately offered to make me a regular gyro (wrapped). I ordered their white pizza to go and they timed it perfectly for when we finished eating. 

Rice was made well (maybe they put olive oil to cook it with?) 

And as a compliment they gave us free rice pudding to-go. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Omg my goodness....where to begin?!?!?
This place is so good. 
My husband went here for lunch yesterday and it was so good that he made me come here for dinner tonight (he couldn't stop raving about it)!
We got the pork gyro...it seriously, was unlike anything I've ever had. Everything was fresh; the meat, veggies, pita and the tzatziki sauce. Speaking of the tzatziki sauce.....TO.DIE.FOR. it's thick which is different from all the others I've had but so delicious. We also had the fries with feta and fresh squeezed lemon on them. The family across from us ordered the pizza, which looked and smelled very appealing. The 2nd best part of my first time experience, was the customer service from the moment i walked in til we left. That in itself is rare to find now-in-days....all the guys are family or friends...and the whole vibe of the restaurant was amazing.  I am sold. I will continue coming here and hope they never leave. They are tucked away in the back and i know they just opened but wish they had more advertisement promoting this place because i feel EVERYONE should come here."}
{"text":"Don't pay $9 for spoiled romaine hearts and canned black olives like I did. (See photos, lettuce is more yellow/brown than green, with an overall appearance of plainness.) Ordered the Four Seasons salad: they forgot the provolone, the peppers weren't roasted, and they also left off the garlic knot. The mozzarella is shredded grocery store cheese. For the price I expected kalamata olives, fresh greens, and quality cheeses. And I was looking forward to the garlic knot [missing from order], so I have to say it was an overall disappointing experience. I've had the chicken gyro before, which is much better and worth ordering again. But if you're a salad aficionado, stay away."}
{"text":"My husband and I just left and are highly satisfied. I ordered the Greek gyro chicken salad and it is so good and the homemade dressing makes it 10xs better. My husband had the Calzone and ate the whole thing and loves the cheeses they use. That's not all, we had the rice pudding at the end and it was delicious as well. Service is outstanding, they checked on us several times to make sure we had everything we needed. I will definitely be back and let others know of this amazing place."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem and my husband and I are happy we stumbled upon it. We ordered a small salad two chicken gyros and a small Acropolis pizza.  The guys working there were super friendly and Poliand hooked us up with a delicious rice pudding for desert. From the cleanliness of the restaurant to the friendly atmosphere it is clear that the owner and staff takes pride in their business. Food was delicious, guys super nice, and the art on the walls is beautiful. Highly recommend you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nothing but positive feedback. I located this business thanks to my maps app and I've been ordering ever since. Super friendly staff and the food is tasty and reasonably priced. Will continue ordering, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Greek food and I was blown away with all the amazing flavors! I had the pork gyro platter and the food was delicious! I will definitely be coming back! On top of the good food, the customer service is an A++!"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE HOSPITALITY!  The food is good. This place is clean despite being hidden in a tiny strip mall.  The staff is very kind and they truly want customers to be happy.  It is a small, very casual eatery that is ideal for take out as seating was limited.  If you like great service and are on a budget, then this is the place."}

I'm sleepy and full. Had a chicken gyro and the white pizza with ham. Best gyro I've ever had and one of the best pizzas I've ever had"}
{"text":"Great food!!! The pork gyro is amazing! Staff is friendly! I work close by and all the guys really go above and beyond! So happy to have great food close to work!"}
{"text":"First, the girl taking our orders tried to explain to me that they don't serve lamb because Greeks don't really eat lamb in Greece, only in America.  I recall many Easter celebrations in Greece with whole lambs cooking  on spits as well as many Greek meals of lamb. Total B.S.
We were really hungry so we ordered a Greek salad with pork which was weird, dry and too salty. The dressing was uninspired and the dukes were huge fat sliced.  
My partner had a pork gyro. They put French fried inside the bread.

The room was extremely hot, food terrible and bad service.  

Do not waste your time or money."}
{"text":"The nicest people run this place. The best customer service I've had since leaving the South. We will be returning."}
{"text":"food was amazing and super fast delivery! great people!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! This is my third time ordering from here, but my first time getting their pizza. I've been trying to find a good pizza spot around Green Valley for 5 years, and today I found the very best! The Spinach Ricotta pizza is amazing! I substituted the sausage and onions for pepperoni and mushrooms and it was heavenly! The dough is light and airy, the ingredients are fresh, and the cheese pulls away from you when you take a bite like in the Nina Turtles! I will definitely continue to come here. :)"}
{"text":"This place was so good! Stop browsing and just try this place out. You won't regret it.

I don't even rate places much but I had to give a good review! 

The service:

The service was amazing. Very professional, extremely helpful and so nice. 

The food came out pretty quick too!

The food:

I ordered a small cheese pizza, a chicken gyro, and chicken fingers. 

The pizza was cheesy and delicious. The gyro was sooo good. My favorite of the 3. The chicken finger were good too. I had the hot and BBQ sauce. 

Very very good food.

At the end he even brought us out a free rice putting. I was surprised of my great experience.

Hope this review was helpful!"}
{"text":"We try it for the first time and it was ok on the Gyro chicken parmigiana was burned don't think I'm going back."}
{"text":"I'm sorry. I usually don't write reviews but I just had to. Food was not good at all. I love gyros. I got Chicken one and it was so spicy I had to take antacids before bed. Asked for extra sauce and it was horribly dry added mayo just to eat it. Thought it came with fries but there were 3 on the gyro and that's it. 25 bucks? No thank u ever again. I will go to another place that has gyros that melt In Ur mouth and tzaziki sauce is the best ever just didn't want to drive after a long day. From now on it's worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant based on reviews, however, it was the complete opposite of what we expected. We ordered two salads, Greek and Gyro, which the menu stated came with garlic knots. It took over 30 minutes to get our salads and once we got them realized that instead of garlic knots, we got pita bread:(. After waiting 20 mins the employee working the register informed us that our food was taking longer than expected due to a larger order that had been called in. This information would have been very helpful prior to placing our order. When we left, there were three other parties waiting for their food and the even their orders were coming out wrong. Definitely not planning on coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Yum yum!!! Went there and got some food to go. They are very friendly. And they treat you like family. The food was excellent. I love that is very close to work. 
I cant wait to try some more stuffs."}
{"text":"New Greek restaurant on corner of Arroyo Grande and Sunset behind the gas station. Open now 2 months. I like they have later hours (til 10pm..11pm Friday and Saturday)

Chicken and Pork Gyros are their main Greek entrées. No lamb or beef options.  Although they do  have cheesesteaks, hoagies, pasta and pizza on the menu! 

This visit I tried the Hummus & Tzatziki dip, pork gyro, Akropolis (feta) fries, rice pudding and baklava! All made from scratch and made to order.

Love the seasonings and spices used. The pita bread is really tasty, and the tzatziki is good, much better than the other Greek place that use to be my favorite. Gyro filling had even  balance of meat, veggies,and cheese. Plus some fries for a different twist! Everything was delicious! 

Dining area is Greece themed with mural of Athens surrounding the walls. I forgot to look at max occupancy, but there are 2 rows of tables that seat 4 per table. It's small  area but enough space to move about. There's a tv for entertainment as well.

Fast/casual, place your order and pay at counter, and they'll bring it out to you. You can also get delivery.

Fountain, canned or bottled soda are your options for drinks. 

The guys here are really nice.  Poli was so helpful, welcoming! Service was excellent!  Thanks for the little extras on my first visit there Poli and Chef AL! I look forward to goin here and tryin out the feta Cheese and eggplant pizza next!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. Lamb Gyro, fries, and the hummus & tzatziki dip combo were great. Customer service was excellent. Pita bread was soft and flavorful."}
{"text":"Sort of disappointed they don't have lamb gyros, not enough to deduct a star. Their fries are amazing, and their gyros are decent."}
{"text":"Loved food and people and the restaurant! We went there today and we ordered Gyro and it was flavorful and I also loved their fries that came with it. When I brought 2 kids with us, a gentleman who seems to be an owner came out and asked if we would like the gyro to be cut so it will be easier for me to feed the kids. I thought that was really thoughtful! The restaurant is super clean and the bathrooms are really clean as well! I strongly recommend this place! Definitely come back for sure!"}
{"text":"We had Company and did not plan for dinner.  I looked on line and the Name got my eye and I thought, \"Why not\".  Best decision ever.  We have already ordered a second time.  I agree, hands down the best Pizza ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"Gyros are awesome. Squeeze a lemon on the Acropolis fries....who doesn't love feta. 

More importantly, these guys have FABULOUS customer service. They get it. Have comp'd a drink a few times in the past which is nice. Don't do it too often as you need to be profitable! Give them a try. I prefer pork while my better half likes the chicken gyro. They are filling!"}
{"text":"This is amazing pizza! SOOOOOO OooeyGooey CHEESY! And made with real, quality ingredients. And huge! And inexpensive! And hidden away in a tiny little plaza. And friendly! They even brought my pizza out to my car for me!  I would like a little more flavor in the crust, but that is being picky. I am looking forward to trying more of their Greek menu options. It is definitely a take-away spot in my opinion, even though they have a little dining room. They offer delivery. They do have weird hours, so make sure to check on that."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to this place, but it wont be the last. My uncle and I came and got the gyro, wich was delicious! Customer service is second to none . They constantly checked on us and were very pleasant.  This is my new go to spot for gyros and pizza. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Excellent food an the prices are very good.  Have to try the pork!

Service is on point. They welcome you warmly the moment you walk in. 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Greek places I've eaten at! Very fresh ingredients.  Tzaiki sauce was home made not watered down! Very friendly customer service.  This is what you call a hole in the wall or diamond in the ruff! No wonder they had 5 stars and over 200 reviews. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service 
Generous portions all freshly prepared 
I want to support this business they care about the guests and the quality of the food 
at the intersection of Arroyo Grande and Sunset across from Natural Grocers
not far from GVHS. Greek style with fresh baked pizza and salads. Sit down and/or
You can order to go  :-)"}
{"text":"So I'm not the type of person to be posting reviews about restaurants and their food, but I do have to say that this place exceeded my expectations. I've had many different Gyros all over Vegas but this place has to be hands down one of the BEST Gyros I've had so far."}
{"text":"Nearly 10 rave reviews so far and not a one of them mention that this spot exclusively uses chicken and pork?! No lamb or beef available for your gyro here, unfortunately. That said, their pita bread is incredible with a touch of wheaty flavor that makes it taste homemade, so their gyros are probably pretty legit.

Came in and got thrown off by the lack of red meat, so I opted for a chicken gyro salad instead- large portion, fresh product, and a bomb Greek vin dressing with plenty of feta cheese. Unfortunately, the chicken was on the dry side and chopped so small that it mostly fell to the bottom of my dish. Oddly, their menu seems to be half Greek and half pizza. Considering how good their bread was, I'd actually consider coming back to see how they do with the pies.

Walk up to the counter to order and then seat yourself. Dining room is plastered with vivid photo murals of Greece to daydream about a vacation while you wait for your food. Staff is friendly, offered samples of their rice pudding as I left. Would come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Tried this place with my daughter today and food was delicious. We ordered the fries, hummus plate, and had baklava for dessert. Everything was very fresh and we enjoyed it. There was more than enough for two people. We are happy we live close to this place so we will definitely return."}
{"text":"I discovered this place about two months ago and I have ordered a number of times since then. I have yet to find anything on the menu that I do not like. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Best Greek restaurant in town. I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't been here yet. It's a family owned business that makes each customer feel as if they are apart of the family. Great food, great customer service, and a great atmosphere. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Amazing place, delicious food, great service. Don't let the location fool you, this place is a gem"}
{"text":"So glad this place delivers! 2nd time ordering from here and not disappointed. I've tried the pork gyro platter (rice and salad) and the chicken gyro combo (sandwich, fries, drink), which were both great and not too dry. Fries were extra crispy, just the way I like em. I do wish they had lamb though.. but overall great food and fast delivery. Average time was 30min. Got a complimentary rice pudding on this last deliver (I'm not really a fan of this type of dessert but the cinnamon with it was good)."}
{"text":"I just found a new place to get Gyros!! For a long time my favorite place to eat Gyros was The Great Greek but Akropolis Pork Gyro just beat them out! The pork is so juicy and perfectly cooked! The Zeke sauce is off the chain and all the ingredients on the gyro including the French fries really put Akropolis Pork Gyro in first place!  I also got some of the triangular shaped appetizer with cheese is spinach inside and it also was really good!!"}
{"text":"First time here and had the Greek salad. Very fresh, crisp greek salad. You can taste that it was freshly cut. Excellent customer service. I really felt at home and comfortable here. I was able to relax with the pleasant setting, given that I work in a sales job. They really did a good job providing such a great experience. I'm sold and definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Very clean, the staff is nice and is very knowledgable of their menu and what the restaurant caters since it's our first visit here. Definitely would come back here again."}
{"text":"Just dropped by for quick bite.  Ordered the pork gyro and wife ordered the chicken gyro.  Pita bread was excellent and meat was nicely flavored.  Veggies were refreshing and yogurt sauce gave a nice creaminess. Service was excellent. Fries very crispy and came out nice and hot. Would definitely come back when in town."}
{"text":"The Akropolis pizza was so delicious -- flavors compliment each other perfectly. And to top it off, the crust was awesome and a nice deviation from traditional pizza dough.

Kind of a small place, but nice. I was just picking it up to go, so I didn't explore much.

I want to try other items too, but I'll probably get the same exact pizza one more time before I start to get alllll crazy!!! 

It's a great starting point if you're looking for a unique pizza, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great place for delivery! They were fast and the food was good. They even gave us some free rice pudding with the order. We will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Every bite is pure heaven filled with the fresh ingredients. It is worth the drive and every penny compared to other pizza places in town!!!"}
{"text":"Super random location which is probably why this is one of the best hidden gems in town! Ok, the food was great. Chicken gyro- YUMM! Salad- delish. And pizza was great too!! However, the best part was the service. I had a pick up/to go order and my hands were a bit full. Without hesitation the man behind the counter grabbed the bags and walked me to my car and put everything inside for me. Great food and just really nice people. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek restaurant In town. They just recently opened and I'm so glad I found out about it. The pork and chicken gyros are amazing. The quality of the food is top grade and the customer service is on point. I had the gyro and my friend had the pizza. The pizza was so good I had to steal a slice. The cheese and pepperoni were so good, no extra grease at the bottom of the box and top of the pizza like you find at most places. The place was super clean and beautiful with pictures of Greece. I would highly recommend it and can't wait to go back there again."}
{"text":"The French fries and sauce are really good!!! The gyro was really good. I'm kinda sensitive to to much salt, so it was a little to salty for me but good flavor."}
{"text":"Great food and great service, the pizza, fries, gyros and rice pudding are all amazing. The food is fresh and service is quick, I am glad they opened near my house and I will continue to support this local business.."}
{"text":"Pros:
* Fast, friendly service
* Good eats
* Not too far from home
* Dinner, with leftovers, for a family of 4 for a reasonable price

Cons: 
* They're a bit hidden in a strip mall. Just look for the Sinclair gas station on the corner and turn in there. It'll be obvious once you're in the lot.

Details on food:
Akropolis fries - hot and crunchy w/lots of feta
Traditional Greek salad - fresh and crisp and generously portioned
Greek salad with chicken - same as the Greek salad with the addition of nicely seasoned chicken
Chicken gyro - hubby said it was very good
Spanikopita - flaky on the outside, hot and flavorful inside - my daughter is not a veggie person and she ate an entire triangle
Rice pudding - cool and slightly sweet with a dash of cinnamon on top

We live in the general area, so we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb if you like nice people and great pizza !"}
{"text":"What a great find on Yelp! After spending the morning hiking around Hoover Dam, I was starving and this pizza hit the spot. 

The pizzas here are creative and unique, with a fun Greek flair. We asked for a recommendation from the cashier, and he basically raved about ALL of the pizzas! My dining companion and I decided on the ricotta, broccoli, and sausage pizza.  We ordered a 16 inch pizza which was more than enough for 2 people (we had leftovers for DAYS). 

The pizza itself was awesome -- the dough was perfect and the toppings were fresh and flavorful. The ricotta really elevated this pizza -- now I want ricotta on all of my pizzas! The owner was super friendly and attentive -- he chatted with us for a while and gave us local travel tips. 

All in all, this was a great lunch spot just outside of Las Vegas. Friendly service and amazing food! I can't wait to go back and try their gyros."}
{"text":"Oh this place is just wonderful. Fets fries are so good and the gyro was so flavorful and drilling in tzatziki sauce, which I love. Will be back. Heard the pizza is good. Hey why not."}
{"text":"The Service here was excellent.  I enjoyed a Greek salad, it was fresh and tasty.  My kids were digging the pizza, but it didn't particularly knock  me off my feet."}
{"text":"Food was tasty. Pork gyro is a bit like al pastor style meat. Spanakopita had flaky crust and cheesy filling. Seasoned fries were tasty.

While the food was good, it's the service that deserves the five stars. Kept offering soda refills and bottled water, no extra charge. They also gave each of us a full serving of yummy rice pudding. While the freebies are nice, it's more about their friendly and generous attitude. It makes you want to go back and support local businesses like this."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 lunch specials: chicken gyro with fries and pepperoni pizza. Both cam with drinks. The chicken gyro was packed with chicken, tzaziki sauce, cucumbers, and was very good. How does this place do pizza this well? Yeah, the pizza was good, just the right amount of cheese, pepperoni, crispy crust, a solid pizza in its own merits. The service was excellent! Unfortunately, they ran out of their famous rice pudding. I'll be back to try that!"}
{"text":"Stopped by by yesterday.  Ordered a Greek salad.  This place is owned and operated by family members.  Very nice people.  Very good customer service.  The salad was huge.  Lots of feta cheese.  I ordered extra Greek vinaigrette dressing.  The dressing has a nice taste.  Next time I will try there pizza"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, friendly service. I had the pork gyro and it was delicious, also the akropolis fries were nice and crispy. This was my first time eating here and I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Just when Greek food restaurants seemed plentiful in Las Vegas, another business pops up and stands out with their chicken and pork gyro offerings.   I was somewhat perplexed to find out that, in Greece, lamb is not the traditional meat of choice for gyros.   Was my American-born childhood filled with lamb gyros a lie?  It must be so since I was told the chef came straight from Greece and uses only authentic products.  Nevertheless, the food here was pretty good.

I ordered a very delicious pork gyro with a nice tzatziki sauce with all the regular toppings plus a few fries inside.   The gyro satisfied my appetite plus more.  Their Akropolis fries with lemon and feta cheese was a good side for the meal but I'd probably just opt to make the gyro a combo for a soda and some regular fries for cheaper.

The guys working there were very welcoming and friendly.   They truly appreciate their customers and offered me a water bottle for free and I was able to sample their rice pudding.  The rice pudding with cinnamon was a nice way to finish the meal.  I would definitely order it next time.

Will I be back?  Yes! Looking forward to trying their chicken gyro and maybe a slice of pie as well."}
{"text":"First time going.. ordered pickup. Sent my son to get it and I am blown away by the customer service experience he had while there. To top that off I just bit into my Chicken Gyro and holy heck it is delish!! My son got the Akropolis fries and he says they are delicious. we will DEFO be back!!"}
{"text":"First timers, we popped in for lunch and so glad we did. The food was delicious, filling, great priced and the staff was beyond friendly and attentive. My platter was filling I had to get a togo plate, you will have left overs."}
{"text":"After a day of traveling I found this place on yelp and it made my day!  I called in a take out order while driving there.  When we arrived there was a miscommunication about a salad. They were super nice, quickly made the salad and gave us free fountain drinks while we waited.  They were super friendly and quick.  When we got back to our hotel to dig in, we discover how delicious the food was.  I come to town for business often and I know I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is a hisden gem I highly recommend that you experience this place if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"The lunch special was such a game changer - pork gyros, drink, and fries. Not only do I support all mom and pop stores, but their gyro was literally to die for... I would recommend this over and over again! This is probably the best thing I've had in the last two months here in NV since I've moved here."}
{"text":"When we first arrived, we were warmly greeted by the cashier. He offered my husband and I a menu to look at and explained all the ingredients they used for their gyros such as chicken an pork. My husband ordered the chicken gyro which he figuratively inhaled in 10 mins. It must have been THAT good. 

I ordered the Akropolis pizza which has sausage, bacon, and some red and green bell peppers. I'm not going to lie, I was sort of disappointed. I was hoping for something a little different from a regular pizza place. They offered to put different toppings on it, but I gave their pizza a shot. 

If I were to say something they could improve on, it would definitely be different toppings on their pizzas. Something they would create and have their name on it. I wouldn't mind it being different, just put your own spin on it Akropolis! 

Lastly, they included some free rice pudding which was actually pretty good. I hope they are here to stay because I'll have to try their gyros."}
{"text":"After the longest and one of the most gnarliest days, nights and mornings I've ever had waking up and having this delivered was a welcome start to a new day!!!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute little place to eat. The food is authentic and I love the photos on the walls. Their chicken parmigiana and cannolis are my absolute favorite thing to try I plan to come back with my fam soon..."}
{"text":"This place is Legit!  Straight up for real..  The pita, Hummus is great and the Gyros were great.   I'll be back for sure.  Hell its worth the drive from now on this is my fav Greek joint!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery a few times. Food was fresh and hot. Service very friendly. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I tried Akropolis pizza delivery last night and it was nothing short of 5 star rating! I ordered a small buffalo chicken pizza and small Akropolis pizza. Both pizzas were so delicious! The gentleman that delivered was very friendly. I definitely recommend this place! I look forward to ordering again and trying more of their menu."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here today. We got a Greek salad and a chicken platter. Everything came on time and was very fresh and delicious! They even gave us free rice pudding to try :)"}
{"text":"Outrageously good! Was hesitant to try at first because I couldn't understand the connection between gyros and pizza but everything we had was so fresh and so delicious. Owner and chef were so nice and accommodating and we appreciated the history lesson on Greek cousine! This place is definitely a winner and so happy they deliver I know they are going to do great  as their food is pure perfection! Try the Akropolis fries. Best French fries we have had in our lives no joke! The gyros and tzatsiki were outstanding also. Definitively reccomend and five stars doesn't seem to even describe them. #newfavoritequickbite"}
{"text":"I definitely welcome this new family owned business to the neiborhood  the food is amazing. I had the pork Gryo, it was my first time having a pork gyro and they didn't disappoint. The sauce was amazing and the customer service was great I felt like family. You can tell this is a genuine Greek restaurant.  They gave me free dessert n I think this is my new go to spot for Greek food. Give them a try u won't be disappointed.."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this restaurant on Yelp and thought I had to try it because of the great reviews. It is the perfect lunch spot with good specials. The staff was very attentive and friendly. I had a pizza with pepperoni, it was a little greasy, but tasted great. I brought a coworker and he had a chicken gyro with fries. He said everything was great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had a carving for a gyro and stumbled upon Akropolis lunch special. I got the pork gyro, fries and a drink. The gyro was the best in town. The fries crispy and well season. I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"We're from out of town and we stopped them very good food definitely recommending it to anyone"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Greek food person but the offerings looked so tasty we had to try. Order the pita + hummus and ANYTHING else: you'll be a believer. Great food, awesome staff, excellent service."}
{"text":"The service  was very good. I had the chicken  gyro, which  I  thought  was  fantastic. The  calzon was really good also. Definitely  will  eat  there  again."}
{"text":"Excellent antipasto salad with balsamic. Flavorful perfectly done pizza. I don't even like rice pudding but theirs it so good I ate every bite. Very clean and fantastic service!  Keep up the wonderful job!"}
{"text":"4 stars, but rounding up for the excellent service! Sometimes that's what sticks out the most to the customer and the folks here at Akropolis make it a point to leave a lasting impression. 

If it weren't for another nearby Greek spot being closed on Sundays, I probably would not have gotten the chance to stop in here. It was the middle of their lunch special (11a-4p daily), so I decided to try their GYRO COMBO ($8.99). You have the choice of either pork or chicken, so I went with chicken. It includes fries and a drink, but they can substitute the fries for a side salad. For drinks, you can get a cup for the soda fountain, or one of the canned beverages in their refrigerator. 

I got two combos to-go, so they insisted on helping me carry the food to my car. As I was exiting, the cook in the back thanked me for stopping by. I love small businesses like this because they actually make an effort with these small gestures. When I got home, I saw that they even threw in a couple of complimentary cinnamon rice puddings -- thanks! 

My chicken gyro was delish, the pita was perfectly fluffy. The tzatziki, cucumber, onion, feta is a huge party swirling in your mouth. I found a few fries in my gyros thinking they got mistakenly thrown in there, but that's how they make 'em for everybody (see other reviews). I'll definitely be stopping in more, and you should too!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Greek food, and this place is on the very top of my list! First of all, I really like the environment. It is a small little place for catching up with friends and not too noisy. Also, the food is AWESOME! I ordered the pork gyro lunch special and it came with fries and a drink. It is a very good deal for $8.99. Plus, I was offered free refills. You can really taste the freshness in the food, from the gyro to the fries~ And to top things off, the server was attentive throughout my meal and offered a small dessert free of charge at the end. Now you just don't get this kind of deal anywhere. Can't wait to go back and try more of their food."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends because we wanted some Mediterranean food and figured we'd try a new place instead of just going to the Great Greek or Greek Bistro. 

I ordered the pork gyro and to my pleasant surprise the worker told us they had a lunch special going on where you can also get fries and a drink for about the same price. Definitely earned some brownie points with that move!

The pork gyro itself was decent. It wasn't bad, but it didn't have anything to make it stand out from the other places I've been to. I also felt like there wasn't as much meat and they went a little too heavy with the tzatziki sauce lol. The fries were pretty good and crispy (you'd be surprised at how many places I've been to where they can't even get that right lol). I ended up paying about $10 for my whole meal which was a pretty good price considering the cuisine and the amount of food.

I'd recommend for you guys to check this place out if you want something casual and filling for lunch. It's located in the corner of a small plaza with a gas station so make sure to keep an eye out if you are trying to get to this location. The workers are really nice so feel free to ask them questions!"}
{"text":"This place surprised us all. We say it is 5 stars so we had to check it out and when we pulled up it's sort of tucked away in this strip mall by a gas station and we were all weary af. Brooke surprised us all, she was an amazing server, super friendly and made the meal that much better. The food was incredible too, all of it. There's a reason it has 5 stars, go find out for yourself."}
{"text":"I'm not Greek, nor have I been to Greece, so I'm very unqualified to say this... But I think Akropolis' gyros are the most authentic gyros I have ever had... Or so people tell me. 

What I can tell you is that they are the tastiest gyros I have ever had. We found this gem about a month ago and have ordered delivery about a dozen times since then. It's our new go-to \"I don't want to cook, but I want something tasty and cheap\" meal. 

The food is always fresh, and always the right temperature. The meat is hot, but the veggies and sauce are cold... Man is it perfect!

Their delivery service is super speedy. We usually get our order within half an hour. And they deliver to Crafthaus in the booze district. The delivery people are always very nice, and knowledgable about the company.

I just can't say enough good things about Akropolis.... You need to order now!!!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious gyro, perfectly crispy fries, and fantastic Greek salad with home made dressing. The lunch special is a great deal, and the service was amazing for dine in! Highly recommend this place for anyone in the area!!!!!"}
{"text":"love love love!!! the food is phenomenal! this place is my go to spot, wont go anywhere else, who ever is in the area you need to try it"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm gonna start with the sad news. No lamb. No beef... But screw it, you don't need it, trust me. The chicken and pork is perfectly prepared. The amount of food is perfect, the fries are amazing. Fresh feta and pitas. The veggies are crisp and fresh. But that's not why they get 5 stars... the SERVICE. the staff is friendly, they go so far above and beyond what is needed. We chose to dine in and they were just so sweet. Free drink and they gave us a desert. I'm not sure who the owner is but he's got it right! The tzatziki is FRESH, like made in house fresh yogurt and dill. 10/10 going to come back"}
{"text":"First time ever eating here or Greek food in general and I will DEFINITELY be ordering from  here again! The pork gyro was freakin delicious! I loved everything about it and the akropolis fries with feta and lemon were so good. Also I ordered delivery and it got to me earlier than expected.  Easily a new favorite!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Athens, Greece and searched for the gyro I was used to eating in the States. Realized they don't serve it that way there. Pork or Chicken. 

Visited with a friend here who invited me to try this place and I was surprised that their food was almost exactly how it was in Athens. So the food is authentic, fresh, and tastes good. 

What stood out even more was the service. They clearly want you to enjoy yourself and your food selection. 

Give it a try. I think you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken gyro and spanakopita lunch meals. Both were fresh and presented well. They have their own chicken or pork gyro meat which is better than other Greek restaurants. We ate in and received excellent service including free baklava for dessert. Seating area was clean with big screen tv with olympics on."}
{"text":"Great guys. Family owned and operated by true Greeks even. Great friendly service. The food is on point. I'm a regular. I often order the greek pizza and the pork gyros."}
{"text":"I don't have words that describe how impressed I am with this place. We have been here three times and every time has been amazing. The food is fresh and delicious. It taste as if it was made in your kitchen. I recommend that everyone comes to eat here."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, our favorite Greek joint in town! The gyros, pizza and pasta dishes are ridiculously delicious! We've tried a few places in town, over the years, and not one has come close to the top-notch quality, taste and service of here. We always feel welcomed and your satisfaction is top priority. I've highly recommended Akropolis to family and friends; they've all raved about it and have become fellow fans. If you're looking for the best favorite Greek dishes in town, look no further! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It was amazing the best service you will ever find and the best food a man can eat pizza was huge and the best ive ever had made vegas worth wild"}
{"text":"Oh Man! Spinach Ricotta pie might be the best no -transitional pizza I have ever had. The crew here is completely awesome! Worth your time and $$."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was. Small location tucked in the back corner of a small shopping mall but the pizza was incredible! Crust was crispy, fluffy and buttery. Sauce, cheese and toppings were all tasty. Chicken gyro was ok, the best parts were with the French fries. (The seasoning on them was great). Tzatziki sauce wonderful with pita. Hummus was so so as well. But great little spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. The crust is thin and chewy. Cooked to perfection. Soft inside and crusty outside. It holds the toppings without getting soggy. The sauce is tangy and delicious. We will definitely be coming back. This is my new \"go to\" pizza restaurant. Salad was fresh. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Super fast delivery ordered through Grubhub. They even brought me free dessert! 
I ordered cheese calzone which is huge for 7.99, the Akropolos fries, and the Hummus and Tskatzi dip with pita bread. All very good! Will be coming back."}
{"text":"UPDATE (5/13/18): New owners, new name. Unfortunately, these folks aren't nearly as polite or welcoming as the old owners. It also seems as if they have changed their supplier because the quality of the food has dipped. I no longer go here. 



Akropolis is a gem, hidden inside a plaza that seems to experience high turnover. Yet, I don't see them falling victim to lack of customers -- these guys are great! 

I frequent here fairly often & always have an enjoyable experience, whether dining in or out. The gyro platter with shaved chicken & homemade Tzatziki are the highlights. The salad is always fresh and properly cleaned with a fresh 'crunch' & their selection of other items (sandwiches, wings, cheesesteak) is welcomed. 

Oh, and they have GREAT pizza, too!"}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical about the Gyro, cause all they served was chicken or pork. Usually other places serve it with lamb. I asked which was the best one. The staff was very helpful and told me, the traditional Gyro is served with pork. So that's what I ordered and I got to say ; definitely my fav. The staff that works there is great and friendly. I'm definitely going to be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good.  They delivered exactly when they said they would.  I ordered online and they called me to make sure they got my order correct which I appreciated.  Enjoyed getting a complimentary dessert.  I was not expecting that so it was a nice surprise for a tired mom.  The delivery driver even helped me bring in a box that had been sitting on my porch.  Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"This a new place in hendeson love the food, would be my new place I love the chicken gyro."}
{"text":"Akropolis lives up to it's 5 star rating! Prices are great and If you are looking for excellent food, top notch service and a nice quiet place to enjoy and catch up with family then this is the spot! If not this is still the spot cuz they deliver too!!!

My sister was in town visiting which is a rare treat and the kids were feeling like pizza and my sister and I wanted something a bit healthier so we decided to try Akropolis after seeing it's good reviews and we were not disappointed!! 

Although they offer a full kids menu, we ordered a large cheese pizza for the kids (3 kids under 12yrs) 2 of which are picky with even their cheese pizzas but they devoured it! I have never seen 3 little humans finish a whole large pizza themselves! We also ordered a pepperoni pizza and my brother was excited to be given the choice of regular pepperoni or Cup&Char pepperoni! For those who don't know Cup&Char, they are those little pepperonis that curl up into little cups and are perfectly crispy and yummy, I highly recommend this pepperoni for your pizza!  The pizza was excellent, crust was perfect and a choice of pepperoni, come on need I say more?!!!

On the healthier side they offer salad and gyros. I like this simplicity that they only offer either pork or chicken for the meat options on these. Both my sister and I ordered the chicken gyros and I had to modify mine with no onion or tomatoes cuz I'm that person but they did not blink and eye and obliged my special request! The gyros were AMAZING!!! They were not stingy with the feta and tzatziki sauce which I love cuz I am a condiment queen! P.S. it also had a couple of fries stuffed in there! The fries were golden crispy and perfect! 

I cannot wait to return to this place, the hospitality of the staff/owners made me feel so welcomed and as if I was a part of their family! I will definitely have to try the pork next time and indulge in some of their other offerings which include Baklava, Spanakopita, Akropolis Fries(Feta cheese, fresh parsley and lemon) and also basic philly cheese steaks and hoagies!"}
{"text":"This place is really great. The food is awesome and some of the best/friendliest service."}
{"text":"I was very excited about the cup and char pepperoni.  I ordered a large pizza with cup and char pepperoni and extra cheese.  One half extra pepperoni, the other half with sausage.  Also, ordered antipasto salad and garlic bread.  We were over all happy with the food, although thought the pizza needed more time in the oven.  I asked for well done and this was barely done.  We will try again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best philly ever! Pizza was awesome and the go-to for authentic Greek food! Great service and wonderful staff! Definately coming back!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Between me & my husband we tried both the pork gyro & chicken gyro, pita bread w/hummas & tzatziki sauce and a Greek salad. All the meat has such great seasoning, the pita bread was so soft, the rostaed pepper hummas had great flavor & the tzatziki sauce is house made & has a great cucumber and garlic taste. The owners are very personable & helpful, if you have any questions they will help answer them. They do also delivery in the area! We live in the north area of town but we'll definitely be back here again!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new and yelp brought us here. We were very pleased. We got a calzone and a chicken gyro. The food was reasonably priced and made to order. It taisted awesome and exceeded our expectations. The staff was very friendly and seemed to truly care about their customers experience. So many places don't concentrate on customer satisfaction but these guys hit is out of the park!"}
{"text":"Had this delivered for the first time and I will say it was amazing got a chicken gyro and spanakoptia I asked for no veggies on the gyro and 99% of the time eat24 gets it wrong but akropolis  got it right definitely  recommend  them delivery was prompt and driver was very friendly"}
{"text":"Not Happy! 

They obviously changed management and the food has gone down hill. My love for the greatest Gyro is now incomplete. 

A few weeks back, ordered the gyro and got it cold served with a comedy act. When I have 30 mins the lunch, I don't have time to sit there and watch a train wreck of ridiculous comments. 

I do not like writing negative reviews but I can't help that my favorite place is now been replaced with less than stellar service and attention to detail."}
{"text":"Either new ownership isn't doing so hot, or they weren't that great to start with. Actually, they're doing hot in a way.

Nikki's Akropolis Pizza is the new name of this business that still seems to be serving gyros and pizzas in a nondescript plaza at the bottom of that hill on Sunset Road. Yelp evidence suggests that the new owners took over a few months ago. Although some of the old signage is still up, the new name is quite obvious from the outside.

The inside isn't that welcoming. There wasn't a TV menu or other sort of posted menu, and they only had 1 paper/to-go menu available. That made it awkward when the customer right behind me asked to see the menu immediately. The dining room was clean enough, but the temperature was at least 3-5 degrees too warm. Summer isn't shaping up to be a good time to visit this restaurant.

I went to the lunch specials menu (available 11-4) and picked out the pork gyro combo ($8.99). It took about 10-15 minutes for my order to come out, which I'm usually fine with when the temperature is more comfortable. The food was hot though, and the gyro had good flavors and textures among the marinated pork, tzatziki, feta, and veggies. The pork meat ended up a little dry though, and there wasn't enough tzatziki to cover that up.

Whether ordered dine-in or to-go, the fries are served on the side in the same plate. They're the thick-cut, crispy and soft variety which I tend to enjoy, and they're properly seasoned. They did complement the gyro but still couldn't cover for the main deficiency.

Oddly, the drink with the combo has to be one of the cans or bottles from the fridge. I realized a little later that I probably could've grabbed bottled water, which would've been good, but I went for soda instead, and that warmed up a little too quickly throughout the meal. Don't fountain drinks tend to cost businesses way less? They'd also help with the drink temperature issue by virtue of having ice.

I wasn't impressed enough to come back to Nikki's, even to try the lamb gyro which they apparently now offer. The reason is that there are more interesting Greek places in the area, not that these guys are a bad option. I would recommend them if you need a quick lunch in the area (looking at you, Roseman).

[REPLY TIME: I told the employee that things were \"good,\" not \"great.\" That's not inconsistent with an experience that reaches 3 but not a full 4 stars. I was mostly done with the gyro at that point, so am I supposed to get sauce for the last small portion? Also, let's be serious, when was the last time anyone has walked into a restaurant and had to ask them to turn on the A/C? Out of my hundreds of experiences in Las Vegas / Henderson, this is the only one of my trips which comes to mind. Stop being either miserly/inattentive and fix your issues including that and the menu.]"}
{"text":"Checked this place out while visiting Vegas.  As usual, I trusted Yelp to guide me in the right direction.  Good choice!  The pizza was delish and my hubby said that was the best gyros he ever ate.  We tried the chicken and the pork.  I wanted to try it but it was gone!!! My hubby ate both of them.  The pizza was great. Another thing that I was pleased with was the customer service.  Just an over the counter type of place but he took the time to explain that a lot of their products are imported internationally.  I can tell they are passionate about what they do and really try to put a good product out. I can definitely appreciate it when shop owners really put their best foot forward.  When in Vegas, this is our go to pizza place.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Only tried the appetizers- Spanakopita and tiropita- Amazing!!  I'm Greek and very fussy about Greek food.   This is the first place I've found in Las Vegas that has great spanakopita!  Extremely great customer service and everyone had a smile on their face.  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"This small place is awesome! We found it on Yelp on our way back from Utah.. The service is great and the food even better. I had the Greek salad with chicken gyro and the feta fries. My husband had the gyro platter. All their ingredients were fresh and very flavorful. We really liked the tzanziki sauce as well. I can see why it has a lot of great reviews. FYI, the parking lot is big enough to park your RV/trailer along the back wall, which is what we did. PS, you must try their rice pudding!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this place out since the reviews are so great! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The fries were AMAZING, I love a crispy fry and these were spot on. The chicken fingers were good, and my husband tried the Chicken Gyro and really enjoyed it. He said it tasted very fresh! Now here's the only problem we had, the pizza was so soggy on the bottom my son refused to eat it, I tried some and couldn't finish it as well. The toppings seemed alright but I couldn't really give an opinion since the soggy crust just ruined the whole pizza. Overall great place, and we will definitely eat here again, I just wouldn't recommend the pizza."}
{"text":"Called and placed a order for my office today and the guy who answer was very rude. I mean customer service is just not his thing. Little does he know that I've been eating there since the old ow ers had the place . Moving fwd...i tried to place my order and he literally said he'll call me back and hung up . Never called back and I'm never going back. Shit service."}
{"text":"fantastic food. fantastic service. got a gyro salad (pork), akkropolis fries, and rice pudding. the salad was much bigger than i thought it was going to be and it was great. will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"SO tasty. Reminds me of the Gyros we had in Sifnos - very authentic. My 4 year old loved the pizza. Great for take-out but they also have a very clean seating area with a chess game and TV. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the guys that work there are great, looking forward to making this a go to place for us in the future. Breath of fresh air!"}
{"text":"Tasty food. The Akropolis fries are yum! Enjoyed the dolmades, a pork gyro along with the hummus and ztatziki platter. Cute place with big photos of Greece which brought back fond memories. The service was excellent. We ordered the Italian hoagie to go and they waiting until just before we finished to prepare so it was fresh. They also brought togo boxes and boxed our left overs for us. We will be back as I think they have the best ztatziki around!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Akropolis Pizza and Pork Gyro. The first thing I noticed when the pizza came out was how vibrant the toppings were! You can tell the veggies are fresh just by looking at them. The gyro was one of the best I've had and the fries were awesome. Great service! They really care about giving you a good experience. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried them again and got their pizza.  One of the better ones I've had in awhile.  Lots of cheese.

Delivery was right no time and the driver was really nice (last driver was too)."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, all around great restaurant! We've been to Akropolis a few times and everything we've tried is incredible! Highly recommend the Athenian Pizza and Akropolis Fries. 

We will be returning to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ive been meaning to write a review for awhile now. My husband and I have been multiple times and have also gotten a large order for delivery which was delivered pretty fast. 

First and foremost the guys that run this place are absolutely amazing! When we first ate there, the server talked with us for awhile and told us some Greek history and about his travels and the start of the company. We also saw the cook come out and speak with some older women who spoke the same language. It was so cute they were so excited. I thought how wonderful that they really interact with their customers. You can tell that they  are really putting their heart and soul into their store and it translates into amazing food and atmosphere. 

The food is really good! Ive ordered something different every time. And I haven't been disappointed! Pizza and philly's are really good.

Also you can tell how clean a place is by the bathrooms and that place is immaculate. If you want great food great service and a great experience, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Just when I thought we had plenty of Greek options in the area another great spot pops up. So many great options are great for people like me that can't get enough Mediterranean food.

The location is a little different, located behind the gas station at Sunset and Arroyo Grande. Don't let the location dissuade you from visiting. It isn't fancy inside, but the restaurant is clean and there is plenty of seating with cute Greek style decorations on the walls. 

The cashier greeted us as soon as entered and provided us menus to help us choose our meals. We later learned that we arrived a few minutes before they open, but the staff didn't let on to this. They were very welcoming and accommodating. Everyone working at Akropolis was notably friendly.

The menu offers many different options. In addition to all of the usual Greek options they also have a selection of pizzas. The catering menu even includes Italian dishes. 

My husband and I both ordered Gyro Platters, mine with Chicken and his with Pork. We both opted for Akropolis Fries (feta fries) as our sides. As others have mentioned, meat options are chicken or pork, not lamb or beef like most Greek restaurants. We ended up with more than enough food for two. For me the meal provided enough leftovers for another meal. 

The salads were very fresh with plenty of lettuce, onion, tomatoes, cucumbers, feta, and olives. The Akropolis Fries were delicious with just the right amount of feta on top. The pork and chicken were both well seasoned, but could have been a little more moist. The pita bread had nice flavor and was perfectly soft. The tztaziki sauce was unique from other restaurants and seemed like it could be made in house. I really liked the flavor and consistency. The Rice Pudding was just the right amount of sweetness and I liked how smooth it was. Overall, all of the food was great. I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"We won't be returning here after the poor customer service and soggy, greasy pizza we received on our last visit.  

We ordered a pizza and were told 10-15 minutes and i picked it up like 15 minutes past the quoted pickup time.  When I walked in the pizza was sitting on top of the pizza oven which makes the pizzas soggy, so if you get a pizza and they have it sitting on top of the pizza oven tell them you want a new one or better yet go somewhere else.  

When I got home I realized the pizza was really soggy and greasy.  I thought maybe it was undercooked or something.  I called them to let them know what happened and they blamed me for picking it up past the time they told me, it's not like I was an hour late or something!  Wow, talk about poor customer service.  It's ok we will get pizza from a real pizza place and Greek food from our regular spot, The Great Greek, that has much better Greek food and better customer service. 

We will let our friends in the area know about our experience here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service - the people that work there, truly care about providing service above and beyond. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was avoiding this place because I was never really a fan of Greek Cuisine, but I am kicking myself for waiting so long to give Akropolis a try! The Akropolis Fries are so good, especially dipped in their unique ranch dressing. I have tried the pizza, the gyro, fries, hot wings, and baklava and it has all been fantastic!! I am SO looking forward to trying the rice pudding, it must be a pretty hot commodity as they are always out of stock, but the pictures on Yelp look Delish! Aside from all this fantastic food, they also have wonderful service! I am proud to be a new regular!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes, based on reviews.  The spanakopita had somewhat harder, greasy dough.  The dolmades tasted canned, no real taste and oily.  The pita was...well, pita.  The guys working were super nice.  But I don't think I would order or eat here again."}
{"text":"Friendly service and the food was great!  If you're tired of all the 'chain' pizza places, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This place is great if your looking for a Greek Cuisine, I love the Chicken Gyro and Pork Gyro. All ingredients are fresh as well! Definitely I will come back!AAAAA+++ for me!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, this pizza is the best around!!! Yummy yummy!!!  Tried two of the specialty pizzas!! Coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just tried this place for the first time the other day. We were immediately impressed by how welcomed we felt. The customer service was beyond amazing. They really took care of us. They even gave us two rice puddings on the house, which was delicious. The gyros were fairly cheap but really yummy and their akropolis fries were out of this world. The place was clean and had beautiful decor. We will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Gyros were awesome. Fries were great. Pizza was decent. Loved the service. Will definitely go back when I am near the area!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We have eaten here several times and have tried everything from the gyros to the pizza. The pizza is some of the best I have had anywhere. The sauce and the mozzarella both taste fresh so they don't leave me with that over salted feeling like I usually get after eating pizza. If the great food wasn't enough the customer service is top notch."}
{"text":"Update: So this place changed owners and you can tell the difference, I'm speaking about the chicken gyros. They just don't compare to what they used to taste like, the qty in the gyro is just rediculous to what it was, the chicken was different and I wasn't impressed at all. What a bummer :("}
{"text":"Awesome place! Probably the best pizza I've ever had. The guys behind the counter were super friendly and gave us 5 star service. They even gave us some rice pudding with cinnamon on top. It was delicious! Will definitely return here again in the future. A+"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Can't really go wrong here. Got the gyro combo and the humus. All of the food was amazing. They brought us free pudding for dessert. Loved all of it."}
{"text":"This place is hands down amazing the food is so good!! The service is immaculate I can't see myself eating at any other Greek restaurants after this most definitely coming back I rate this joint 5 stars no questions asked , gotta come here if your in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza Place Ever!! Very Affordable and the food there is perfection  Their pizza is amazing and awesome customer service"}
{"text":"I had no choice but to try this place... I've never seen a business have 5 stars on Yelp with over 100 reviews! What a feat!!

What's legit 5 stars is the service. Pulling into the parking lot of Akropolis I was second guessing my decision to eat here... it's tucked into the back side of a small mini-mall with a parking area that is semi-shared with a gas station (womp womp).  We walk in, and there's no menu above head, just a counter and menus on the side... the guy working the counter asked if we were eating in and we replied yes-- he immediately whisked us off the the right where the seating area was to seat us and wait on us. 

The seating area isn't anything special, but the service was. The guy took our order, brought us free bottles of water, brought out the food-- made sure I got a (huge) size of tzatziki. I mean... these folks legit bend-over-backwards with regards to service.

We ordered a couple pizzas, a chicken gyro (I wish they would have had regular beef/lamb gyro meat, but they only offer pork or chicken), french fries, and dolmas (of course). The pizzas were so darn cheesy... a lot of cheese, but not a ton of flavor, they were good, but not incredible. The chicken gyro was good, the dolmas were good, and the fries were bomb.com-- soooooooo goood!!! Dipping those fries in the tzatziki was the highlight of my meal.

We went to leave, and the waiter boxed all our leftovers, insisted we take home some free rice pudding and graciously thanked us for our business.

All in all, I would feel guilty even giving them 4 stars... they were just so darn friendly, courteous, hospitable, and perfect gentleman/waiters. It's so weird to find this kind of service in a little strip mall restaurant... it's like entering a glitch in the matrix or something; If only there was this type of service in all the restaurants in Vegas. 

The food is good, like 3.5 stars good, not \"incredible,\" but the service was so good- it deemed 5 stars absolutely necessary."}
{"text":"The pizza is great! And the employees are super friendly. I haven't tried the Greek food yet, but I would imagine it doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Food is amazing ordered the pork gyro with fries everything was tasty and large portions very affordable as well I think it was $7 including a drink. Will definitely go back dudes that work there are super friendly too!!"}
{"text":"Once again a great tasty meal. Pizza &  Gyro so very good. French fries were very crispy and hot still which was very unexpected...a happy surprise as i normally dont get fries form any restaurant as they are usually cold and soggy after the drive. Akropolis has figured out the secret. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in after a long day of test driving cars. We were starving & wanted something fast and good. The 5 star average on Yelp drew us in & we were not disappointed. The waitress was very accommodating as I asked for half the items to be left off the gyro salad. My husband loved the pork gyro. It brought back memories of being in Santorini. The complimentary bottled water and homemade rice pudding was an added treat. We would definitely go back & highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We are pizza here all the time. Go to spot, they never disappoint. Pick up special is an amazing deal and their customer service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is a small Greek establishment, possible papa and son? We ordered Gyros, pork/chicken, and what a surprised to find fries in there and that in addition to the fries they give you. 

We were surprised to find that they gave free rice pudding to the customers. It was very good."}
{"text":"What a great place! A gem in Henderson! My friend and I ordered the chicken gyro, white pizza, Akropolis fries and a Greek salad to-go. Wow--a lot of food! First, when I went to pick up our order they were so friendly in the store. I was a few minutes early for the pick-up time and they offered me a drink during my brief wait. Then when the food came out, they kindly carried it and placed it into my car for me! So nice! There was no way I would have been able to carry all that food to my car on my own. Excellent service! 

As for the food...it was delicious! The chicken gyro tasted really fresh and was quite large; not skimpy. The fries were still piping hot by the time I got back home. My friend enjoyed the pizza and the fries and said she'd definitely go back! My personal favorite was the salad. The dressing was very tasty! Everything was nice and crisp!

Neither of us had been here before, but we were impressed and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! This will definitely be our new go to take out! Got the kids chicken finger and pizza. we got a chicken gyro and an Italian hoagie. And the hummus and Tziki (sp?) with pita bread. The chicken gyro was the best! The hoagie was delicious but expected a little more meat. All the food was fresh and came out timely. They even gave us some free rice pudding with our meal! Customer service was top notch. Please go see them! We need more small business to succeed, especially in Henderson!"}
{"text":"This place is great! They have a pork gyro, I haven't had one before and it was so gooooood"}
{"text":"Craving for Greek? This place is awesome!!!
The Food and the staff, who are actually the owners are amazing!!! We got the Pork gyro(absolutely Good) ingredients are fresh! They make everything inhouse. Their pizza with cup and char pepperoni was bomb! They made us try their dessert, Rice pudding"}
{"text":"I wasn't a big fan of gyros until I ate here. I live far but every time I'm in the area I refuse to eat anywhere else. The tzatziki sauce is amazing. Dill is not too overpowering and neither is their garlic. The chicken is perfectly cooked and their fries are crunchy and delicious. They even put some inside the sandwich! Their lunch special is generous and comes with a drink. I highly recommend! :)"}
{"text":"With many good Greek options in the Henderson area, this place has been my first choice lately! First of all, I am obsessed with their tzatziki sauce and freshly made pita. The best ever! The greek salad is plentiful and the pork well seasoned. The chicken gyro was delicious partly due to great pita and tzatziki sauce. The fries inside the gyro was also a nice treat. The pizzas here are also good and extra cheesy. My only complaint is that it was a bit too cheesy making it greasier than I am used to. The rice pudding is a nice not too sweet way to end the meal!

{"text":"What a great place. We came for lunch and had a bit of everything.  The food was fresh and made to order.  This and the friendly staff has won me over from Yanni's.  Come try this great neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Being a die hard Great Greek Mediterranean Grill fan, I was skeptical to check out another Greek restaurant. I'm sure glad I did though. This place definitely exceeded my expectations. The staff was extremely friendly and gave us complimentary dessert and even gave us the tv remote to choose what to watch. (the olympics baby!) I ordered the cheesesteak which was decent, but my girlfriends chicken gyro changed me! I probably will never get another chicken gyro unless it's from Akropolis. They also are open late and have pizza. Go America"}
{"text":"I moved in down the street and ate here 5 times in 2 weeks sandwiches and then one day we're like lets order a pizza we pick it up and it's so soggy there's liquid dripping out of the of the dough it was a soggy disgusting mess so gross so we called and they said it was our fault cuz we took too long to pick it up which we were there within 15 minutes of ordering the reason it was soggy on bottom is becouse they put it on top of a hot oven which draws the moisture down into the dough. They said no they won't make another Pizza and no refund no credit sucks cuz now it's been 8 months and I have not eaten here again which could have been another 30 times they would have made their money back on that s***** pizza 

Ps I worked in several pizza places as a kid never seen Pizza like this. It's crazy cuz I thought they were nice when I first started going there and then the way they acted just so unprofessional it's the customer's fault"}
{"text":"I went here on a whim.  I was a little leery of a pizza and gyro combo restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised. I got the gyro, and it was delicious!  The gyro was fresh and the veggies and the tzatziki sauce was excellent. One of the owners talked with me for a few minutes and was very nice. 

A great place that should do well!"}
{"text":"Not too busy for 1pm, super friendly service and the place is very clean, even behind the counter. Small simple menu, 5 different lunch specials from 11-4. Pork gyro and fries combo with drink 9 bucks were excellent - gyro meat had great flavor. Definitely more towards 5 star then 4 star. 
4.5/5"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic!!!  Great value.  There was alot of food.  Chef is from Greece, authentic greek food, gyro and spanikopita.  Son's loved the pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered a chicken gyro, Akropolis fries and a Spinach, Ricotta Pizza. The Chicken pita and Akropolis fries were our faves. Pita was soft, chicken was tasty and tender, veg was fresh and the sauce was excellent. The fries were fresh and so hot we couldn't touch them when they first came. The toppings on fries were so tasty. It's a great fry dish. In comparison to the gyro and fries, the pizza was less dazzling. It was a good size for a large and had plenty of ricotta, which was impressive, but not very flavorful. I didn't taste any of the garlic herb sauce the menu said it was topped with. The pizza actually needed a little salt to bring out the multiple flavors. Delivery guy was early and friendly. We will definitely be ordering from this  pace again!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant, excellent food and outstanding service, and at reasonable prices.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Oh this place is so good! Try the pork gyro! Amazing! The walks dressing is the best! It has fetta crumbs in it!!! The fries are so crunchy and tasty too! Not to mention the service! Oh they're so attentive! Ok so this is not a fancy restaurant, it has more of a fast food feel to it, but it's nice! The waiter not only brought our food to the table, he also asked how the food was and refilled my root beer when it was almost gone! What a great little place!"}
{"text":"The staff were  incredibly helpful, friendly, and the food was delicious. I'll certainly be back to try their pizza next time! The wallpaper of the different Greek cities is a nice touch and adds a vibrancy to the dining area."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. Came earlier than they said...food was hot and delicious best I've had in town. Pork Gyro and the akropolis fries were amazing! They included a courtesy dessert which was equally yummy. My new Favorite!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice this week it is so DELICIOUS! I recommend the hummus, gyro, and pizza!! It is one of those meals where you are full but you keep eating because it is just so good!"}
{"text":"Ok, first off, aside from the delicious chicken gyros everyone raves about, what truly blew me away was the genuine service by these gentlemen. I think I accidentally walked in off hours with my boyfriend (I'm so sorry! I was morbidly embarrassed after leaving!) and instead of telling us to take a hike, they treated us with such awesome respect and 5 star service. Management, thank you so much for treating us like friends, we had such a great time! (They had a chess board on one of the tables... we're nerds lol)

Now, the food. We both got the chicken gyro combos for lunch which came with fries and a can of soda. The fries were SO GOOD. The gyro was filling and satisfying, the tzatziki sauce was not too thick and so tasty. You can taste the love. 

Truly a great place to go when you're craving a gyro! Hands down best meal experience ever."}
{"text":"Don't order through yelp and if you want ur order to be right make sure you call, said the manger. With no care to make sure my order was right. Then why give your customers the option to order online.  I order wings, Stromboli, and a gyro. The wings came with no ranch or any option to select sauce and the Stromboli also came with no sauce.  Lost my service for sure."}
{"text":"Damn! Mega fast service! And hot N fresh! Lots of flavor, fries very CRISPY! Yum! And the gentleman there are top notch! Very cool and attentive. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"I live close by and my husband has been raving about the lunch specials.  So, I took the girl child there for dinner a short time ago.  It was a smidge warm; we decided not to stay.  We ordered our food to go.  The gentleman who took our ordered provided my daughter with a soda while we waited.

We ordered: kids pita grilled cheese, akropolis pizza and a calazone for the hubby.

My daughter loved the fries.  They were flavorful seasonings, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  She liked the pita grilled cheese ok.

The pizza was amazing!  Totally worth the 15 minutes it took to make it.  Every single ingredient was a dance party in my mouth.  

Hubby cut the calzone in half and systematically devoured it. He could have easily eaten the whole thing. But why gorge?  He adores those calzones.

Chatting with the cashier, he told us that they are known for their gyros.  I promised next time!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin...first off they have exceptional service. They started us with drinks on the house because our order took just a tad long to come out but we were totally fine. They also provided a complementary dessert. 

The food was perfect! The fries are extremely crispy and flavored...definitely my favorite!  I had the chicken gyro and it was perfect! Only thing I wish they had was lamb gyros!  

I will definitely recommend this place to everyone and I look forward to coming back for my exceptional food and service!"}
{"text":"Great food and service like you don't typically experience in Vegas. We keep coming back and recommend it to all of our friends. We love it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving gyros, and we wanted to try somewhere new and found this place on yelp. I looked at the reviews and thought the reviews were good so we gave it a go. Well the reviews lived up to the expectation! For starters the service was incomparable, best service we've ever received in Vegas, from being greeted to the very end of our meal the service was perfect. Secondly, the food was fresh and very filling, we got the gyro platters and there was a lot of food for the price we paid. My favorite are their french fires, perfectly crisp and golden brown.  We felt completely taken care of while we were there and my husband and I plan to go back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time yesterday. Ordered their chicken plate and it was so good! My gf and I ate inside and where checked on frequently if we needed refills or anything extra. The staff were so nice! We also tried their dessert and it was so good! Would for sure go back."}
{"text":"Wow this place really lives up to the hype. Everything was extremely fresh and the Akropolis fries are crispy on the outside and soft im the middle just how i like them. The cashier was extremely knowledgeable about the source of their meats and traditional Greek food history. The best part was when the owner came out to make sure everything was good. He really takes pride in his work and it shines as each bite tastes as if it were made with love! Will be back!"}
{"text":"It's Pizza and it's close to my house.  Two positive things in their corner right out of the gate.  I have eaten here twice and both times the food was good.  My kids loved the pizza and I had a calzone which i was not able to finish.  Not because it was wasn't good, it was very good; but because of the size.  I ended up eating the rest of it the next morning for breakfast, because i was worried one of my kids would try and eat it first."}
{"text":"The chicken gyro and pita with hummus was an amazing meal. So filling but still fresh and full of flavor."}
{"text":"I was iffy on ordering from here because I have seen 5 stars before and the pizza places have been horrible but this truly is 5 STARS! Since my first order of pizza was absolutely  amazing and my children proclaimed it was the best pizza ever i have ordered numerous other times. We have ordered pepperoni pizza, pepperoni and sausage Pizza, akkropolis (spelling) Pizza, the cheese calazone, the antipasto salad, and the Greek salad. Let's talk salads for a minute because they are amazing the antipasta salad is good and the ranch has extra dill in it which makes its dilly tasting different but very yummy. Now the Greek I hate to say it is the most amazing salad I have EVER had! The Greek vinaigrette is something to die for! I hate to say this cause I don't want to give away the town secret but you must order the Greek salad EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. YOU. ORDER. I have had dreams and cravings for it Seriously. The pizza is awesome it's cheesy and cooked to perfection. It's a tad on the greasy side but it is so so yummy. The calazone was yummy also the dough is cooked to perfection and their is the perfect amount of cheese to ricotta cheese in it. I wish the sauce that came with it was warm but it doesn't take much to warm it up once it's at my house. Oh and the rice pudding is amazing also! On our first order we were given some for ordering for the first time and it's a winner it's a perfect mix of sweet and savory and everything you want in rice pudding.  
Let's talk service everytime I have ordered I have been greeted on the phone by amazingly nice pleasant people, they deliver fast, and if something isn't cooked to perfection they will recook it for you or give it to you for free. That kind of service is unheard of. I love the service here and that's part of why I order so often I want to support local amazing businesses and this is truly one of them."}
{"text":"Tried this tonight for the first time. Pizza was absolutely delicious. On top of that, the customer service was phenomenal. Also had their rice pudding which was very tasty. Will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Hawaiian pizza for delivery tonight. Pizza came loaded with plenty of ham and pineapple, and extra cheese. It was really delicious! No complaints here.

Look forward to trying more from their menu. 

Delivery was right on time, about 50 minutes from order being placed.

So far, this might be my pizza delivery place for this neighborhood."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place I've  ordered twice and have been satisfied each and every time I am so happy to live down the street from a five-star restaurant I ordered their Philly cheese steak sandwich and fries which is very delicious.. you get what you pay for trust me the portions are very large I love that it doesn't take away from the quality most places will give you quality but not quantity to the owners please keep up the good work you guys are the best! The review speak for itself!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything on the menu is superb. 
Salads, Pizza, Gyros, you name it, its good! 

Staff is always friendly and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"This place is great if your looking for a Greek Cuisine, love the Chicken Gyro & Pork Gyro. All ingredients are fresh as well."}
{"text":"This is going to be quick and easy! It doesn't take a novel to explain greatness! The absolute BEST gyro and fries I've had in a very long time! Omg they've perfected flavor infusion. Stop it! (Me to myself to stop scarfing in public) hahaha So there it is! Go, buy, eat, and ENJOY! 
5 stars can't wait to return.."}
{"text":"Ok....had to try this place after seeing all the raves about the pizza. Large pepperoni and chicken fingers with fries. Loved the fries...daughter said chicken fingers were really good. As for the pizza....for 9.99...damn good. Better than Napolis...not as good as pizza rock...but pizza rock is way higher priced. Will definitely be back to try more on the menu and will be getting pizza again for sure. Not to often do I find a pizza place where I like the crust as much as I like the pizza!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while looking up gyros to eat for lunch. We decided to come here based on their 5 star ratings, and it was nothing less than perfect. The place is tiny and quaint, and very clean. The workers were beyond friendly! We ordered the hummus, dolmades, and chicken gyro to share. This was more than enough food for the two of us and even had leftovers. While dining in a gentlemen gave us two homemade rice puddings that were on the house, they were absolutely delicious! Definitely will return regularly. (:"}
{"text":"Delivery was very fast, and they threw in a rice pudding with the order. Their Spanakopita is delicious!"}
{"text":"Chicken Gyro was great, amazing fries and the staff are extremely nice. It's not the cheapest Greek place but it's not overpriced. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is no longer Acropolis it is now Nikki's pizza with different owners and different food. No bueno.




This Greek restaurant is fairly new being here in the neighborhood for a few months. The Gyros here are probably the best in all of Las Vegas. They are made from scratch & made from pork. Apparently in Greece gyros are made exclusively of pork. One thing that really stands out is their customer service. They are so friendly at Akropolis they make you feel like family. I have not yet tried their pizza or other menu options because the gyros are so amazing but will soon. The homemade rice pudding is also made from scratch and is a must have."}
{"text":"I spent a summer in Greece and have been consistently disappointed with the Greek food here in the states. However, this place is beyond amazing. I feel like I'm back in Greece AND they deliver! I've ordered almost everything on this menu and never been disappointed."}
