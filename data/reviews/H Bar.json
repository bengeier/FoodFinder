{"text":"Food was not good. I had the \"smoked\" beef dip and my partner had the po' boy. What little beef my sandwich had was dry and flavourless. It was covered in a very strong cheese which would have been nice on its own but we terrible with the beef. The au jus was pretty much just salt. The only redeeming thing was the salad which had some nice house made pickled veg. My partners po' boy was just as bad. The fish didn't seem to have any seasoning at all and she could hardly eat it because of all the sauce making it fall apart. It's a shame the food was so bad because our service was great and they have a nice drink selection. I'd go back for drinks but not food."}
{"text":"Great local bar with superb food, and wonderful service. 

I searched along Queen st. for a sports bar to watch with Raptors game while having a quick bite and a drink. There is a $15 burger + beer special for Raptors games (and another special for Leafs games, and one for NFL games, so most of your major sports games are covered here). The server noticed I was watching the Raps game on one of their 2 decently-sized screens without sound, so she considerately asked me if I wanted to change the sound system from background music to the game - and of course I said yes. 

The I ordered the burger + beer special, and added the BBQ trimmings which included excellent BBQ sauce and caramelized onions, which was an extra $2. I opted for a side garden salad (instead of fries), which had a good variety of greens, and came with a balsamic vinaigrette which was thankfully not overwhelming. The burger came out perfectly charred on the outside, and tender on the inside - the charred flavour is key! The poppy seed bun was was fresh and nicely dense. The server summarized the beers on tap very well, and I went for a local selection, which was lightly hoppy and easy going.

Overall a pleasant surprise along crowded Queen West, with good food,and a great option to watch the game with a solid meal."}
{"text":"We ordered from H Bar through JustEat for delivery after reading and hearing great things about the restaurant. 

I got the fried cauliflower and my partner and friend each got an assortment of sliders. After a very long wait for the food it arrived cold and soggy. The cauliflower was complete mush and tasted like the fryer oil hadn't been changed in quite a while. The sliders, despite being an assortment, all tasted the same and were burnt. The menu options sounded wonderful, but none of the items we ordered seemed to be made with any care. We ended up throwing everything in the garbage after a few bites. 

I called to ask for a refund and spoke with one of the owners. She was very polite and open to hearing the criticism, she assured us that we would be fully refunded for the order. It has now been almost three weeks with no follow up or refund. I am as disappointed in their customer service as I was with their meal."}
{"text":"Great spot in Toronto that always has something going on. You can catch the game or come to one of their many events like trivia night. The food is unique and delicious and you can tell it's all made in house from scratch. They even make the effort to create new ingredients for cocktails if you're really feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"Great local bar with seriously good eats and nice mix of local personalities. A lot of thought is put into the menu and there's always something fun like trivia going on.  And with multiple TVs and a huge screen, it's a perfect place to watch sports."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a guy who is a regular. He brought us here for food and drinks. He promised that the food was incredible, the service was quick and friendly, the atmosphere was fun, the beers were unique! All of this may have been more true if I had gotten super drunk like the majority of our party. But some of us have work every day and not just on weekdays. 

Beers were average. I got a Canadian lager that tasted just like Blue Moon. My buddy and I were nonplussed. We got fries to share and the maple aioli that comes with them is awful. Overly sweet for a savory food. I asked for ranch and that was also homemade: watery with too much dill. I then asked for ketchup. I do not like ketchup. 

Everybody got sliders. \"Best sliders in Toronto,\" the guy says twenty times as we peruse the menu. Okay, I got three different types. It took over 45 minutes to get them. I know because I timed it. And I was starving. So I was hungry and mean. The sliders are okay flavor-wise, but have way too much bread. I already forgot the kind I ordered because they were forgettable. The fries are okay. And I've already explained why the dipping sauces are lacking. 

To be fair, the server was very friendly. And that's why this isn't one star."}
{"text":"Came here for a great brunch on Mother's Day. Loved the breakfast sliders. A very nice touch with flowers for mom. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service, food and ambiance. Surprising there aren't more reviews on this one. We dined in the upstairs portion, and it was intimate and not too loud. OH AND THE SANGRIA IS DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Drinks special and half priced wings on Monday. Wings were really small. Picture showed 20 wings."}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight on New Year's night and everything was amazing. Service is still amazing by the regular staff, they always make conversation and constantly check up on you. We got some sliders and a few drinks, the food never lets us down. The Raptors game was also being played on the big screen. We noticed this time there are some board games for us to play and that is a fun touch!! It made our night even more lovely.

We also stopped by a few months ago for free Bar Trivia which they host every Tuesday night. It was a great experience and a live crowd. Full of laughter and jokes. They sometimes have themes like Doctor Who, Orange Is The New Black and Stranger Things. They do take reservations, so I suggest calling in advance to book a table!!"}
{"text":"A few of my friends had a joint birthday on the 2nd floor of H bar. The staff were so attentive, so accommodating, and so much fun! The drinks were awesome and a great price, and while I didn't have anything to eat, a few other guests at the party did, and they said the food was great. I would definitely return to H bar again :)."}
{"text":"So when we went here they didn't have any fish and couldn't make the pasta dish we ordered which was a pretty big portion of the menu.  So we had to settle for the a few of their sandwiches. The burger was below average. I bit small for my liking. But the pork belly sandwich was amazing. If it wasn't for the fact we couldn't order a few things on their menu I would probably give this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game and grab some grub! Upstairs is nice and cosy. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly, great food, good atmosphere.  Go upstairs and enjoy a drink - they won't let you leave without a hug from one of their beautiful bartenders. This place has become a regular spot for me and I couldn't be happier with it."}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at H Bar.  It opened about two years ago and I've walked by it tons of times.

I ordered the Keeping it simple burger (no lettuce or onions) and fries.  It was a really good burger.  The bun was soft (just how I like it) and the patty was tasty.  The fries were cooked well and salted just right (there were lots of fries and I couldn't eat them all).  I'd get this burger again.

Melissa was my server.  She was friendly and chatty and took great care of me.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The owner is gracious, lovely and fun. The Wednesday night open mike is like a family affair upstairs.

You must give it a go."}
{"text":"this place hosted my friend's fundraising event and the upstairs space was big enough for the people that turned out, ~30. we went on a thursday so they had their special 2oz for $6 on bar rails and it was amazing! the drinks were not watered down and really effective and friendly service by Melissa. she's wonderfully welcoming and a hugger. i also got medium-sized wings and tried their fries and deep fried cauliflowers. we got hot honey and dry rub for the wing flavours and they were full of flavours! i was a bit disappointed in the size of the wings themselves...very small! i have nothing bad to say about the cauliflower...done to perfection! i didn't check out the music downsrairs but they had live music. would recommend this place for a group or just a small gathering"}
{"text":"Kudos to the chef for being able to meet my dietary requirements with a smile! The veggie noodles (modified with marinara sauce instead of pesto), topped with chicken was just the perfect dish! Our Father's Day dinner was perfect and we'll definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"We thought it would be a great idea to pick up a picnic basket of their gold package before our date at Trinity Bellwoods one night. The basket was cute but the contents inside were not.

The roast beef had so much fat on it that only 1/8 of the portion they gave us was actually edible. The \"selection of meat\" consisted of that fatty roast beef that my 4-year-old daughter could have made better and chicken that was dry AF (there was only enough chicken to make one sandwich btw). The bread was rock hard. They were \"out\" of potato salad and did not bother making more, forcing us to change to a boring garden salad. Their \"selection of cheeses\" consisted of goat cheese and cheap mozzarella (who likes goat cheese anyway?) Oh and they were also \"out\" of the donuts and the replacement sounded so bad we opted out.

Overall a great idea, but a terrible execution. I highly DO NOT recommend this place for their picnic baskets. You're better off to go to Loblaws and get your own fresh and delicious ingredients for half the price. The gold package should instead be called the charcoal package, just sayin'."}
