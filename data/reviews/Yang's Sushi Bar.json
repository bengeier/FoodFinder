{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner yesterday and this is one of the better AYCE places I've been in Mississauga. The staff is so friendly, accomodating and patient (there were 8 kids in our party running around the restaurant and they were totally cool with it, gave us a friendly reminder to keep the kids in line but totally in a respectful way which we really appreciated). The fish was fresh, generous portions and delicious. Their rolls were good, I wasnt blown away by it but it was satisfying. Their cooked food was really good.  My favorite was their beef tenderloin, buttery, garlicky and cooked to perfect. What really impressed me was their chicken teriyaki, my 2 year old niece who is a picky eater, ate 2 servings of it and wanted more. That's a testemant of good, kid friendly food that's not french fries. I had a really good birthday and they made it even better. Thank you!"}
{"text":"\"Famous Sushi is just as bad as Yangs\""}
{"text":"Had the worst experience ever. We would order food and it never came!!! There was about 10 people and we left still hungry. I would have gave 0 stars if it was available. Service sucked big time. They treated us like we were not even there . If your planing on going in a big group don't . avoiding this place is a must"}
{"text":"I hadn't realized how great their AYCE sushi quality is until i truly compared it o they stores and the downtown joints in toronto. Their fish is fresh, good teriyaki salmon, great amounts of large pieces salmon in their salmon handrolls, awesome scallops, their salmon roses are also awesome (since its basically sashimi with only a tiny bit of rice), rice was well seasoned and both the fish and rice was cold. Although yangs lunch ayce is more pricey than most other Mississauga ayce sushi joints, it's well worth it"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in gta. Love the spicy mayo they make, delicious! Always recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Overall; not bad but not good. I would probably not come again.

Pros: Came early, lots of wait staff constantly coming to table.
Restaurant appeared clean and modern looking.
Staff was friendly.
Decently priced.
Food came very quick.
All you can eat.

Cons:
Japanese restaurant run by chinese.
Food was so-so. Sushi rolls looked sloppy. (But ok for AYCE)

Although this place was okay, there are much better places for the same price is Missisauga."}
{"text":"Been my favourite in Mississauga. 

selection is large, the quality is very good. 
Every dish looks very beautiful with the garnish."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday and lunch was 13.99 if you're paying cash and 14.99 if you're paying by card.

Food is better than other AYCE joints but service isn't the greatest. Gave it a 3/5 because...
- table was dirty when we sat down
- forgot to give us our water and tea
- asked for 2 ice creams for 2 people but they gave us 2 scoops in ONE bowl and one SOUP spoon...seriously?
- not a fan of the mandatory 10% service fee that's included. I think if service is subpar, customers should be able to reflect it in their tips
- also forgot our maki rolls we ordered, which isn't too big of a deal at AYCE, I guess"}
{"text":"Edit: it used to be good when Anderson was managing tho place. I have never seen avocado full of black spots used on sushi in his times. Now every sushi roll that came to the table looks Halloweenish ... Kinda black and kinda rotten. Ok, maybe not rotten, but I'm not coming here again.


Great food. Staff is friendly and the manager is a great person. You feel welcome. Lots of sushi rolls, hand rolls. The salmon is always fresh and delicious. They don't have tuna but they make up for it in other ways. For meat eaters, tons of meat dishes, the dessert menu is limited but the icecream and the mango pudding are both wonderful, in fact the icecream is one of my favorites ever. They used to have red bean flavor but its discontinued. Sometimes the rice can be a bit dry..."}
{"text":"Just visited this place today, and they've decided to add the 10% gratuity and also reduced the menu. They no longer serve a number of dishes like the black dragon roll during lunch. 
The woman who served us was also quite unprofessional. As I was having a conversation with my family, she repeatedly walked by and interrupted us and tried to join into the conversation. When we were asking for the bill, she acknowledged us three times but never brought the bill, so we just sat there for 20 minutes. Overall, I'd recommend the Yang's in Markham. There was another review that gave a similar take on my experience but for some reason it was removed? I should've listened to ya!"}
{"text":"Better than Wasabi!  No question.

Being a fan of the original Yang's in Richmond Hill, I was looking forward to visiting their newest branch in Mississauga.   Fancy digs!  Looks really nice inside-way nicer than all the other Yang's I've been to.  

Sashimi (esp the salmon) was really delicious, the rolls were typical, but it was the hot food that really surprised me.  Tempura was not greasy, rather very light and crisp (they got the oil temp right, and it was cleaned out regularly), grilled squid was sweet and tender (not overdone) and finally the takoyaki reminded of midnight street food in Tokyo.  Ice cream is always the same; mango, green tea or vanilla.   Yawn.  Why do AYCE sushi places ALL have the same ice cream? It's like a secret underground Chinese-sushi- buffet-ice cream-monopoly mafia.  

They lose one star because it's $25.00 a person every night of the week, whereas Wasabi ranges from $20-$25 depending on the day."}
{"text":"Had a party here for approx 100 people for my sons baptism. Excellent service . Julie was fantastic and extremely accomodating . Many people were impressed with the food and will definitely go back :). Love it here. Thank you Julie."}
{"text":"It's an \"ok\" sushi place, nothing special. It's a sushi buffet too, if you choose to. Their beef and salmon teriyaki are very good. But for some reason, I didn't enjoy their sushi as much as I thought. Feels just like any other sushi place really, I expected a bit more. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I went to Yang's during its grand opening period and I haven't visited since because I wasn't too impressed with their food nor service. First of all, what bothered me most was the price. I tried the Yang's in Vaughn and could understand that it aims to be high-end and matching in quality, but unfortunately the AYCE Mississauga location does not live up to that expectation.

First of all, there are some pros. The sashimi was generally fresh, although limited in choices (probably because it opened at the time) but took a long time before it was served to our table. The garlic stir fried beef tenderloin was also the highlight of the meal as it was salty deliciousness that my friends continued to order.

Now the bad occurs: the menu is very limited in terms of specialty rolls yet they charge a premium price. They don't even have spider roll, which I have seen at every other AYCE restaurant for cheaper prices. I was very disappointed that for a restaurant that decorated itself to be upscale, it lacked menu options and creativity in sushi rolls. Service was a bit slow despite being one of the only customers in the restaurant. It was like a Friday night, and when I went, only half of restaurant was lit and barely filled. It was pretty shocking because dinner time is usually peak period and there were barely any customers.

Lastly, one of the managers or someone higher up came to our table twice to ask if we enjoyed the food... which made me feel uncomfortable because it felt like they were fishing for a compliment. Lo and behold, when we said the beef tenderloin was good, he went into pretentious mode and bragged that the sauce they used and how they prepared it was special, etc. and honestly, I just felt like it was a pathetic attempt to 'win' customers on how great the food is by appearing to casually engage in conversation.

To add insult to injury, they add automatic tip... I know many other places do this, but that doesn't mean I agree. In this case, no matter how poor their food or service is, they still get their minimum tip's worth. 

Sadly to say, I have not been back and will not revisit, unless they drastically decrease their price or have vastly improved their service/menu. Otherwise, there are still plenty of AYCE sushi places in Mississauga that I would choose above this."}
{"text":"The most unpleasant host, think it's the owner. Have some respect for people. Service is quick though."}
{"text":"This is a mediocre sushi restaurant. There wasn't anything that stood out exceptionally about it to me nor did it really lack in any department. The food itself tasted good, I was there for the AYCE dinner and got quite a few things on the dinner menu that I enjoyed. I mainly ate the cooked meats and maki rolls, which I enjoyed. 

The service was reasonable and we didn't have to wait long to flag down a waiter to order our food. One issue we had though was that you don't get everything that you order everytime so you need to re order things to get it. 

Overall, I would recommend this location to a friend who is looking for a good sushi location in the area."}
{"text":"Yang's Sushi Bar is probably my favourite place for sushi, hands down.

This is my go-to sushi joint. Everything i tried there is great; from the salmon sashimi, to spicy tuna rolls, to beef skewers. It's fresh and tastes delicious.

Not only is the food great, but the atmosphere too. This place is clean, elegant and the service is fairly quick.

I have been introducing this restaurant to many of my friends, whom have all liked it very much. :)

I definitely recommend you to check it out! :)"}
{"text":"Not a fan of Yangs on the 3 occasions Ive gone here. The service is super slow, and they have mistaken our orders repeatedly because of us having to use the same order sheet. Parking is a pain, the food was just average, and the price tag wasn't so friendly either. Have not gone back here as there are much better restaurants in the plaza I would much rather go to."}
{"text":"***1/2 STARS

I am not usually a fan of stuffing myself silly at AYCE (All-You-Can-Eat) places, but when I do I usually opt for a sushi joint.  I've been to quite a few in the GTA and the reviews are all over the map.  When it comes to AYCE sushi joints, you should keep the following in mind:

Chinese-owned

10% automatic gratuity

Variable service (e.g. Sometimes its really good, and sometimes  
you have to re-order half the things you originally ordered because they \"forgot\" about it)

Inconsistency in food (e.g. The same beef short ribs you had last time that were amazingly good, this time around - are not)

Yang's came up on my Yelp app, so I decided to give it a try.  Otherwise, my default go-to place was Prince Sushi - at least when I'm in the west end.  The interior decor is quite modern - reminiscent of a Milestones or Moxies say.  The chairs are presumably faux leather as are the booth seats, with dark brown tables.  The restaurant itself is quite spacious.  It is located inside of a Chinese strip mall that is also home to many other eateries and a supermarket.  Parking is plentiful.

Things I liked about this place:

Sushi here is not 80% rice and 20% filing - this allows you to sample more things and not fill up on rice
 
Extensive menu save for the dessert items which are a grand total of 3

Breaded items are not too oily

Gratuity is not automatically added to the bill
Clean washrooms

Things I disliked about this place:

Scant dessert menu

Random service (e.g. At the beginning the food was coming out expeditiously and then there was a random interval of 15 minutes where we were chewing on our chopsticks)

Minor details (e.g. They brought our sushi, and we had to ask for the wasabi - that's like serving me fries with no ketchup!  And when they did finally bring us wasabi, it was a small dollop of it.  Is wasabi more expensive post-Earthquake now? Me thinks not!)

Their sashimi is some of the freshest I've had from an AYCE, and their sushi rolls were all delicious, and as I mentioned, not just mouthfuls of rice.  The sushi chefs here are great as all the rolls stayed in one piece and didn't fall apart on me.

We were offered 2 complimentary scallops dressed with mayonnaise and fish roe - these were nothing special and the scallops were made from frozen and overcooked.  I know, how ungrateful am I to be complaining about \"free\" food!

I would recommend the following items: Yang's Roll, Spicy Crispy Butter Fish (Tuna) Roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll, Black Dragon Roll, Salmon Roses, Takoyaki, Butter Fish & Salmon Sashimi, and the Short Ribs.  The short ribs were the melt-in-your-mouth kind of tender and although flavourful, it was lacking the charred flavour that I seek in a good short rib.

I would warn against the following: Onion Tempura, Salmon Neck (not my selection), Sole Fish Fillet, and the Fried Calamari.  In short, I found all of their battered items to be bland and boring.   To elaborate, we took one bite of the calamari and stopped eating it - even the mayonnaise couldn't save this dish.  The calamari was also too chewy which added more to the yuck factor.

Although I wouldn't blacklist their Teppanyaki Sirloin Beef Cubes (aka Garlic Beef), I did find it to be a tad salty.  Their Unagi Sushi also tasted a bit weird, but when the BBQ eel made a reappearance as a component of the Black Dragon Roll it tasted fine.  Maybe it was just that piece?

Verdict:

As common practice at AYCE restaurants, weekends are more expensive ($25.99 vs. $22.99) for dinner.  My opinion is that Yang's is a good quality AYCE restaurant - just stay away from their tempura items.  The sashimi is fresh and the rolls don't skimp on filling and overfill you on rice.  Service was good for the most part, until the kitchen started halting our orders.  This was probably for the better anyways as we ended up cancelling some items that we originally ordered for the sake of getting uncomfortably full.  I would definitely come back to Yang's when I'm in the west end."}
{"text":"I was very hesitant to come here due to previous reviews but it was my friend's birthday so I really had no choice. I came in with very low expectations and all I can say is - 2 stars is generous. I found that most of the items we ordered lacked flavour. We started off with calamari - rubbery, bland and UNDERCOOKED. The fried scallop was okay, thanks to spicy mayo. Some sushi rolls weren't bad and the sashimi was very fresh so I will give them that.

Other reasons that factor into this rating:
- Coke was flat. When I requested a can instead (which was what I said to begin with), the server said that cans aren't included so it will be extra. Sure, but really?
- They were slow to clear dishes
- Because we had to keep re-using the same ordering sheet, they kept making mistakes and bringing out items we already ordered and ate
- 10% mandatory gratuity for 2-10 people (I think) and 15% for parties of 10 or more. Completely understandable for large groups but for 2 people? Don't be so pathetic, you guys obviously know you don't deserve it that's why you tack it on. You also ruin the potential to earn a larger tip just by pissing people like me off with the word 'mandatory'

Overall, I was not satisfied with the food nor the service so it was a complete rip off for me. It would've been nice if they had a choice between a la carte and AYCE because I definitely would've just chosen a la carte and had a light dinner. I don't recommend this place at all it was a huge let down."}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5/5

Probably one of the better AYCE sushi joints in Mississauga, although the only other good one I can think of is Prince.   All other AYCE joints are pretty much meh.  I would have put the Spring Rolls by Square One as a good joint, but it's no longer AYCE.

I liked everything here except for the sushi itself.  While the fish was fresh, I thought there was way too much rice.  However, we also got the spicy salmon crispy roll and the rainbow roll, which was delicious.  Also, strange that they have no seaweed salad.

Full order:
Miso soup
Agedashi (cold tofu)
Spicy Salmon Crispy Roll
Grilled Squid/Calamari
Chicken Karage
Fish Roe, Tuna and Salmon Rose Sushi
Sole Fish Fillet
Spicy Beef Udon soup
Curry Chicken Don
Grilled Salmon Belly
Rainbow roll

I would say that the hot food and apps get 4/5 and the sushi itself gets 3.5/5.  While service was prompt and dishes came out quickly, there were a few strange things that I didn't like:

-you have to ask for plates when you do AYCE, which is kind of weird considering that we aren't going to eat straight from the serving dish
-ginger wasn't served with the wasabi, so had to ask for it
-10% tip added on automatically (even for 2 people)

So while I think this place has decent decor, decent food, it's got some little quirks that would prevent me from being an every month customer - maybe once every 2-3 months.  Also, lunch price is a bit more expensive than normal - $14.99."}
{"text":"Having frequented Yang's in Markham numerous times prior to any AYCE sushi places popped up in Mississauga, I was looking forward to a great meal.  I was  very disappointed.  Servers were inattentive, the soy sauce was sweet... Not sure why. The waiters messed up our orders most of the time.  I let the messed up orders fly at Yang's in Markham because the food was generally good, but I can't let it go here because the food left something to be desired.  Too much rice on the rolls. Basically, with 168, heart, prince, sushi sushi around there is no excuse for the terrible food and bad service at Yang's.  I'm surprised they are still open."}
{"text":"I haven't had a chance to their their AYCE lunch so I can't say much about it. I did have their bento lunches which were very delicious and filling. My only complaint would be the price as their menu items cost almost as much as their AYCE so you're better off just getting that.

Overall, the food was excellent, service was speedy, but you may need to double check on the prices."}
{"text":"Decor is clean & modern looking with dark colored theme.

Extensive menu, however it was useless as service was slow & hit & miss, I failed to recieve all items.
 
On the plus side, sashimi is very fresh & taste was optimal.
  
I recommend, Yang's Roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll, Black Dragon Roll, Salmon Rose, Takoyaki, Butter Fish & Salmon Sashimi,  

I advise against tempura anything at this place.  Too much batter.

Cooked entrees are alright, nothing overy good worth mentioning.

10% automatic gratuity & inconsitent service, It's an ok place but I would go elsewhere for my sushi fix."}
{"text":"As I sat down and began looking over the menu, I had to laugh. It took a moment but I recognized the music playing in the resturant as one of the CDs that I used to use for massage sessions! LOL!

Aside from that, I also noticed that the ambiance was quite nice. A very large space divided into two dining rooms, decorated with contemporary furnishings. There was plenty of wait staff floating around and I found them all to be very friendly.

All of the items I had were good. Nothing outstanding, but solid. 

The lunch included pop was only $13.99 plus tip and tax which, in my opinion was a great deal.

I expect to return when I've feeling a sushi craving and don't want to drive to Brampton for Hockey."}
{"text":"Food, and service is much better than the Markham location. Price is decent. Not the best, but definitely not the worst AYCE sushi in town."}
{"text":"The sign out front no longer says Yangs. . . . Which should have been a red flag to start. The service is good but that's about all that was good. Beef sushi served frozen, on ice?! Make rolls say 6 pieces on the menu but never came in any thing more than 3s!?!?! And what kind of place has a mandatory 10% gratuity for parties under 10!?!?!  This plaza is packed with restaurants. . . . Maybe we will try another next time we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"A good choice for all you can eat in Mississauga.  Had lunch today with the gf and everything was good. Rice to fish ratio on sushi and rolls is good given the fact its all you can eat. $14.99 but you get a $1 discount when paying cash. Will be back"}
{"text":"Sub par \"Japanese\" food. Maki has green beans in them, rolls are stale and everything is pretty much bland. Giving them two stars is pretty generous..."}
{"text":"Craved for sushi! Great place to eat and service was fast. The sushi was fresh and delicious. Their spicy sushi had a real kick to it, needed to chase it down with some tea :) . Their appetizer can be a little better, especially their calamari, sirloin steak and chicken wings, just need better seasoning or batter. Their waiters were great, polite and fast and very helpful. Would recommend this place to anyone nearby the area."}
{"text":"Our usual sushi place was packed so decided to try this place.  It was good but nothing special to write home about.   This is more  2 1/2 stars than 3.  Food was forgettable.  Service wasn't that great either.   Our visit just helped us validate that our go to sushi place was still tops - a balance of quality food for a fair price."}
{"text":"Came here with friends on a Thursday evening before the long weekend.

I wasn't sure whether this was associated with the one in Markham, but we had the AYCE dinner, paid in cash and my friend had a VIP card (10% off).

The place is large and took over some of the other restaurants that formerly inhabited the space. Decor was nice, and felt Japanese to some degree.

The food was underwhelming. Despite having a fairly extensive menu, I found that the wait staff was very disorganized, understaffed and wouldn't actively check up on you. We had to wave our order sheets in the air a few times before we got any attention.

Even then, we would never receive everything we ordered. Out of a theoretical 20 items we would order on the menu, we would be surprised if we got 12-14 of the listed items.

Being a critic to AYCE in general, I probably wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a holiday. $23.99 for AYCE (there is a discount if you pay in cash). It's good value if you eat a lot! 

The space is really big and very accommodating for large groups. Decor is fancier than your average sushi restaurant and the washrooms are really clean, with bamboo decorations. Service is efficient -- thanks to a simple system where you tick off your order on a paper menu (like many dim sum restaurants -- this place is run by Chinese people). They bring out the dishes pretty quickly. If you don't see something you ordered after 15 minutes, I would remind your server because chances are they either forgot or gave it to the wrong table, who didn't say anything. 

Yay! : spicy salmon rolls, butterfish sashimi, stir-fried mixed vegetables, beef tenderloin ramen, grilled eggplant 
Meh... : agedashi tofu, mango salad, vegetarian sushi pizza, mango pudding

This is a decent option if you are looking for AYCE. Otherwise, if I'm feeling like sushi in Mississauga, I would go to Hinote Sushi (a non-AYCE Japanese restaurant)."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3.5/5. I came for their ayce sushi on a friday night. Suffice to say, i was not dissapointed in regards to the food. I pretty much ate only sashimi. The sashimi was fresh, and tasted great. However, when ordering massive amounts of sashimi, you have to write down large quantities on the ordering form, but you only get a fraction of you ask for. For example, i wrote 30 pieces of salmon, but then get 15. This gripes me because it makes me order again, and gives my brain sufficient time to tell my stomach i am full. In this way, i am prevented from stuffing myself silly. I guess it is both a good and a bad thing, cause if you eat too much, you're gonna feel all sluggish, but when you go ayce, you gotta go big, ya? lol well at least for me. 

Another issue i have with this restaurant is that my add on the tip at the end. Then they don't tell you. This wreaks of sneakiness, and i dislike it when restaurants do this. If a tip is warranted, then they'll get it! An automatic 10% tip ain't cool!

On a brighter note, the service was good. It was easy to flag down a waiter and tell them your order. The food came fast. I have no complaints in this department.

Overall, i would probably come here again. Because of the swift service and the yummy sashimi, the 10 percent tip was deserved. However, i still dislike the fact that it was added on.  But whatever, it's not gonna stop me from coming here whenever i feel like gorging like a grizzly, so long as the sashimi is fresh and the service is good!"}
{"text":"The white tuna sashimi just melts in your mouth like buddah. Super fresh and clean. I think I ate about 5 pieces of those, could have ate more if I didn't stuff myself with other yummy goodnesses there. 

Really like their 'Yang rolls', not sure what it was inside but it had those little red eggs in there and shrimp tempura. No wonder it's named after the restaurant. 

Their sushi and sashimi were all spot on and their hot food were all very good. This isn't a place where you get up and put stuff onto your plate and eat at your table. You write down what you want, and it's made to order. 

My sister and I were very surprised that this place was so good. Maybe we didn't have that high expectation for an all you can eat sushi place? But everything we ordered were cut perfectly, fresh and tastey. 

Some things we ordered were: 
Steak sirloin on skewer (med rare, yum)
Salmon / White Tuna sashimi (double yum)
Salmon / Eel / Spicy Salmon / Yang rolls (triple yum!)
Eel pancake (it was ok, limited 1 per table)
Soft shelled crab roll (yum)
Udon with Shrimp tempura (also comes with an extra tempura veggie)
Ice cream with friend banana (yumm) 


I recommend this place. 

FYI, our waitress/manager wasn't that friendly, she was fine, but I wish she wasn't so busy all the time."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for a great AYCE sushi place in Mississauga because.. well, we don't have a good one. People usually rave about Prince Sushi in Courtney Park, but that one is far (non central), pricey, small, and as a result of it being small, stupid (because they don't take reservations for small groups). There's also 168 Sushi on Dundas and Erin Mills, but that place, though I frequent there, is hit and miss. And Maki Maki?? Please! Good riddance that that place folded. 

But Finally! Mississauga has a AYCE sushi place to rave about! It opened I believe 2-3 weeks ago, and I have been there three times already. 

This place is fairly central Mississauga, and it replaced a fairly popular dim sum joint, which replaced some Shanghai joint, which replaced some congee joint. I've frequented all those restaurants which occupied this location, and I hope that Yang's is here to stay... at least for a long time. 

The ambiance and decor is very nice. There was a long period between when the previous restaurant closed down and when Yang's opened up. I don't know how much of it was spent in construction, but I like their end result and effort. They serve you your food on nice ceramic plates and bowls (which seems to be the trend for AYCE sushi places nowadays), so it shows some sense of class and elegance in their presentation. Sashimi and sushi roll arrangements had evidence of effort placed into them, even during their busy times, so I was impressed with that (other certain places, busy or not busy, had really ugly \"I-don't-give-a-damn\" arrangements). So hats off to their sushi chef.

Speaking of sushi, the fish is very fresh. I'm overall very impressed with the food quality in this place. For example, I like hand rolls, and most other places usually botch up the hand rolls because the seaweed wrap would be stale and soggy and they would overload the rice. At Yang's, the seaweed wrap is fresh and crisp and there is a good ratio of rice and filling. Their hot food is also very good too! Notable mentions include the fried chicken cutlet udon, the kalbi (beef ribs), salmon teriyaki, and the takoyaki (fried octopus balls). 

The food selection, compared to other places, is not as extensive, for example they have no Spider rolls (soft shell crab) which other places do, but I'd overlook that fact because so many pros of this place outweighs this con!

The second last fact that brings me to giving this place a high rating is that they offer sashimi on their lunch menu; the lunch price is $15/person so that is fairly cheap given the circumstances! Like I mentioned before the fish is very fresh. The only thing that prevents this place from getting a five-star rating from me is their sashimi ordering system, as you can only order 5 or 8 pieces per order sheet. For someone like me who likes to order 24 pieces of salmon sashimi at AYCE places to start off, this place doesn't allow that. Perhaps it is to protect their business so people don't overload and abuse their sashimi, but it is just different from all the other places.

Lastly, their ice cream is SUPERB. I've never had such heavenly ice cream in my life. Great way to end!

Overall, for me, this established itself as the top AYCE sushi restaurant in Mississauga. Go and support them!"}
{"text":"Great sashimi, decent service, but they added the tip to our bill (two people dining) without even telling us and then walked away with the extra tip I unknowingly gave them with a straight face"}
{"text":"Probably 2/5 Food is great.  However,  service is really BAD. Orders are not come as ordered. The wait is too long......to considered as acceptable.  The experience is poor."}
{"text":"A year ago, this was arguably the best AYCE sushi in Mississauga. My family decided to return here for my birthday dinner. Compared to newer places in Mississauga, this place has fallen below par. The fish, although not terrible just isn't as fresh as others. Salads are over garnished, to the point where they don't taste right and their Beef Sashimi, a dish I used to love here, has fallen below par too. Presentation is average. I just wish things were more fresh. Hope they improve soon. Because after today,  I'd spend the extra 10 min driving to Heart Sushi in Heartland."}
{"text":"Had the AYCE lunch yesterday.

This time was went a little easier on the Sushi and went for the other hot dishes like the grilled salmon and steak.

The salmon was award winningly great!
It didn't last long and we ordered another 2 rounds right away.

The shrimp tempura could be improved, because I have had better..

Excellent friendly service is the icing on the cake.
Totally different from a Chinese restaurant...

We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Usually visit here when I'm in the area.  It's a AYCE sushi buffet, last time I went, the waiter would write down what I ordered.  All dishes come in a sporadic fashion (whatever is made first?)  There were dishes for sushi lovers and non-sushi lovers.  Feel sort of sorry for the staff because they constantly have to keep up with customers and bringing over food.  Overall an ok place for AYCE sushi, usually end with orders of ice cream and mango pudding.

On another note I hear they changed management/location? Ill post an update if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Friday night, went for a friend's birthday dinner. We had two tables totalling 18 people. Our food orders stopped coming after the second order. Repeatedly asked multiple servers to check on our order but each would leave and not return with an explanation of where our food is. The food never came in the end. So therefore it was not really an all you can eat sushi experience. For our large party they added their mandatory 15% tip, everyone paid $30 for their meal but left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check out Famous Sushi and see if there was anything different from Yang's. We were initially worried because we knew there was a different owner and that could mean lots of changes. Everything looks exactly the same, including the menu and order sheet. It still says Yang's Sushi on it besides the sign outside.

Service was pretty good the entire time we were there. The servers were friendly and explained which each sashimi was. He also told us that pop was now included in the ayce dinner price. Sweet! So we each got a drink.

Everything we ordered was great and they all came out relatively quickly. The fresh sashimi is now presented nicely with different artistic cuts of vegetables. They even served it on a banana leaf...reminds me of Heart Sushi. The rolls were a nice biteable size and did not fall apart. We didn't order dessert because we were too stuffed.

I would definitely recommend this place to others and will come back another time."}
{"text":"We've been to this place twice. Buffet menu had a lot of choices on it but they choose what to bring to you and even if you order it again they won't bring it. Which is ridiculous unless you run out of half of your menu I don't think avoiding your customer's order is the solution. 

I went back to order a party tray this week and it was definitely not worth the $50 bucks I spent. Fish was not fresh and it was very plain. The waiter there was trying to sell me more (at a restaurant?!) sushi because apparently it wouldn't be enough to share.. I insisted that there are other food items for the party so he finally let it go. 

Overall, first experience was good besides a lot of missing items and that's why I went back but it completely disappointed me and don't think I would go back there."}
