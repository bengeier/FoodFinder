{"text":"Under new ownership Oct 2017, assumed  they would have been the same. Boy! Was I wrong. The French fries are too big (thick and long) they over cooked them and tasted burnt. I ate 1 and had to grow the rest away. Banquetburger was just ok, maybe it tasted better because I was starving. Not like it used to be. Bacon was undercooked and chewy. Meat was overcooked, had to pick off burnt bits. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I've lived around the corner from Golden for almost three years, and it's a staple in our house! The pizza is great, crispy crust that isn't too thick, and nice thin pepperoni. I will say that the pizza is best when it's piping hot, so if you've ordered delivery or takeout and let it sit for too long it won't be as good. If you can dine in for your pizza you'll get the best pie. If you must order takeout, just try to get there on time to pick it up. We always love ordering takeout pizza and wings on a Saturday night to eat while watching the Buds. 

Straight up pepperoni pizza is your best bet. Plus add some wings because they're pretty good too. I've had many dishes off their menu, and I must say that the non-pizza/wing dishes may leave something to be desired. That being said, why would you order Greek food at a pizza joint? Order pizza, wings, and heck while you're at it get some mozzarella sticks too. 

The staff is very kind and I have only ever had one bad experience there. The problem is that sometimes they send all their debit machines out with the delivery people, so if you want to pay with debit (I don't have a credit card so I almost always do) you have to wait until the delivery guys come back. We were so hungry and our takeout order had just come out of the oven, and we had to stand there for twenty minutes just waiting to pay for it! The staff was great the whole time and gave us some free pops and dips for our trouble.

Other than that I have always enjoyed Golden and will continue to eat there until we move in a few months."}
{"text":"I have lost all respect for this restaurant.
recently, I witnessed a hit and run involving the death of a dog. The driver was an employee of Golden Pizza. I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Growing up pizza is a staple (pizza parties, delivery..) Being an adult now, I have grown to hate the typical pizza (pizza pizza, pizza hut, 2 for 1, etc.) But I have started to grow in love having pizza in a pizza place... Fresh not bought by a slice but to have a whole pie with the toppings of your choice.

I have taken the 100 bus for about 18 years and have noticed this place over and over again.  

We took a chance one night and go for it.  I was a bit hesitant because I hate pizza crust. I just think they are just too much carbs with all the pizza I am eating. Growing up I need a dip (aka pizza pizza). 

I was amazed how their whole pie came to life.  We ordered XL for 3 people. Yup. We demolished this thing and it was great! Fresh! Not too much crust which I ate most of it. It wasn't too much sauce that the cheese was sliding everywhere. I was great.

I have been back at least 3 times for dinner and my favourite toppings are Gyro (yeah you can get that here!), green olives (I love them and they put a generous amount), and fresh mushrooms.

The service is great. The place isn't fancy but they serve the food that you came for."}
{"text":"Ive been living in Don mills for over five years and this is by far,...the best pizza I've had from local stores. Lots of cheese, and generous toppings. Loved the crust too....already planning order for Saturday night to watch hockey. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with my friend to eat in for the first time as I've ordered from them countless times. Everyone was extremely friendly, service was prompt, the food was hot and delicious, and the servings were well worth the prices that aren't even pocket draining. My friend and I both agreed that this will be our go to place for future meal dates."}
{"text":"Heallow. I a go to goldens pizza for a Greek food. Rice and potatas was a no good. Very no cook enough. Calamari very nice. No busy but the a waitress forget my saganaki. No good service. she a forget to bring one of our dinners. So it comes late. It's a very very cold. No turn on heat. We eat with hats and coats. All of the Greek salads only have ONE kalamata olive. One olive malaka!"}
{"text":"Racist!  Was not even offered a waiting time!  Staff was very rude and unfriendly, and unprofessional.  When we asked where we can be seated a worker rudely said \"we having nothing for 'them'\".  They didn't even offer a take out menu!  I would not give this poor excuse for a restaurant a cent if my money knowing that they are extreme my racist assholes.  Don't believe me? Try it, try go there as a non-white couple, and take a video of your experience.   Never ever again!! Don't go there it's totally not worth it!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's our go-to for delivery pizza. The sauce is great, reminds me of pizza from Montreal. It's not fancy, it's greasy and delicious."}
{"text":"Im a chef. Best calamari ive ever tried. And ive tried a lot. Very highly recomend it. Pizza is great also. Havent tried much after that but cant wait! Just moved to the area recently and they have now won me over. Ill be here often. Service is great also very friendly."}
{"text":"What the F happened to your Pizza Goldens! It used to be awesome, with two kinds of cheese, and the best crust ever. Now it is all changed. Probably needed to save cash, but ended up losing a long time customer.  I actually drove half way across Toronto to get a pizza, and I was soooo disappointed. Boooo!"}
{"text":"Very great customer service - they were quite nice when I came in to order out.  The pizza was fantastic - very classic, full-bodied, and filling.  A good, standard, but flavorful pizza.  The toppings were fresh, the cheese nicely done, and the crust was full but not burnt.

The interior was pretty great - well decorated in a homey, pub kind of way.

Mmmm, I can't wait to go back.  I think it will be a staple of my visits to that neighborhood."}
{"text":"New owners, new cooks.  
They changed what I loved best the taziki going to have to try a few other things on the menu to see what else they have changed.  Hopefully not too much."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious. But yesterday I ordered from them and they put pepperoni on a pizza meant vegetarians (honestly not the biggest deal, mistakes are made). The problem was when we called back they were super sorry and said they would send a replacement out right away but it took just over an hour to get to us.  A few minutes later the super  nice (and embarrassed) delivery guy knocked on my door and asked for the mistake pizza back, which is super strange."}
{"text":"I only gonna review the pizza but the spicy sausage on the pizza isn't spicy and the pizza itself is drenched with oil, the only thing I liked is the thin crust but other than that the pizza just tastes mediocre.

The one other thing I loathe is the piece of dough in the middle of the pizza, it doesn't make the whole pizza look any good and it tastes bland. Also you cannot pick extra topping as it will charge you more money and seriously one topping of a large pizza isn't appealing and worth purchasing. 

Downtown restaurants especially like this have the worse parking too.."}
{"text":"Lots of food for incredibly reasonable prices. It's solid quality and I've only ever been treated kindly. There is more to the menu then just pizza too (even if it's in the name). I'm reading some comments that don't seem to make sense, as I've only ever seen the staff prepare their food well.

Anywho, want lots of food for reasonable prices? Golden Pizza."}
{"text":"This was my second take away pizza adventure at the Golden Pizza.   The staff was friendly and the service was quick, and the atmosphere inside seemed nice, so no complaints there.
The toppings and cheese were ok, but the crust was not to my liking in the slightest. It was oily, limp, and lacked flavour. This is really recipe/cooking problem, which is not easily fixed. It's a family business, so I feel bad, but there are too many other independent pizza places that serve up way better tasting pizza. If they improved their crust recipe/preparation, I'd be willing to go back. Otherwise, I suggest you try another independent place."}
{"text":"Don't know who raised this Jeremy guy, but i'm assuming he must be a competitor because his review couldn't be further from the truth! Great pizza, no chain can compare to it, they load it with cheese something that tends to lack in other pizza places, don't judge a book by its cover because this is one of the best pizza joints I've tried in the area, phone etiquette can be improved but when you see them in store they are very friendly and polite!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Nice homeburgers. Greek fries are tasty. Fish on a Kaiser is great. Chicken fingers are the best."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and solid comfort food at reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Great pizza delivery. Some unique toppings (Gyros!) that make the experience that much better. I have only ever had pickup or delivery. Eat in restaurant looks ok...but not anything that great."}
{"text":"We had a good veggie pizza and cold beer that is served in nice frosty glasses. 

Little patio in the back which was nice to enjoy in the summer."}
{"text":"This place isn't always bad, but when it's bad, it's really bad. Tonight we ordered pizza and wings. The wings had the wrong sauce, but were acceptable. But the pizza was so soggy that even the box had lost its integrity. 

We threw 8/10 pieces away."}
{"text":"This is the kind of pizza that mom would make from scratch, and let me tell you my mother can cook. I just wished they had a few more topping."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place with that small town, non-commerical pizza taste in Toronto when I moved here, and Golden Pizza delivered my wishes. I haven't tried any of the other food, however I am sure it is just as tasty"}
{"text":"I live near Golden Pizza and I've ordered approx 10 times. I've had their pizza, wings, panzerotti, Greek salad, and desserts. The pizza, Greek salad, and panzerottis are very good. The wings and desserts are so-so. This place is a little pricey but I like supporting local spots. 

Only criticism: one of their delivery drivers is very rude. Myself and my neighbours have had run ins with him. Last week he waited for a tip- I told him I tipped him over Just Eat. He checked the receipt and said \"Oh yeah, I got your 2 bucks\" in this snide way and left quickly. 1- I gave him 15% and it was $2.81. 2- I have lots of options and don't need to order from Golden Pizza so he should check his attitude. 

Overall, I will definitely order from them again, their food is tasty. However if Buddy gives me anymore attitude I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is really not good. Let's start with the fact that the crust is definitely thawed from frozen and tastes extremely stale like eating cardboard. The toppings are also the most lack lustre.... there are many other pizza choices on danforth, any would be better than this place."}
