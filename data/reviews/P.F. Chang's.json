{"text":"The food is really good, try the beef enchiladas with hot sauce go set at the bar when the mariachies are playing drink a corona eat some chips and just enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"I grew up going to PF Changs.. Mostly locations in California. 
This PF Changs however is in desperate need of help. My husband and I have visited here two times to be met both times by slow, incompetent service and slow, poorly cooked food. 
We will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We went here New years Eve and had a great dinner. The service was excellent and my Lemon scallops and chicken Lettuce wraps were amazing.I highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Well I went in and asked what the wait time was. The hostess said it would be about 35 minutes. I went back to the car and told my wife. We agreed to wait. Went back inside and to put our name on the list and were seated immediately, so that was awesome.

Out server, Steph, was busing a table next to us, but put that hold to take our drink order and appetizer order which almost never happens anywhere. When she came back with our drinks we got our order in. The food came out way quicker than I expected.

The Hunan hot fish was so freaking good. No joke. It was thick cut with a chicken like texture but was tasty like fish ought to be.  The crab wontons were also a delight. I tested Steph to make sure the crab wasn't from a can and she passed. We ordered the pineapple/coconut cake. Fresh and refreshing.

As far as Steph goes... she was attentive, friendly, quick, took our orders accurately, and knowledgeable about the menu. She gave us the feeling that we were the most important couple in the restaurant.

Previous visits here, we had Chris as a server and he was also awesome. A manager did tell us that we can request to either sit or be waited on by our server of choice when we eat here."}
{"text":"Another reason to enjoy a meal at PF Changs, ( aside from good food )....that mural on the wall is not just wallpaper. Custom hand painted, ( every P F Changs has a different one) it depicts an authentic Chinese legend or folk tale, which your waiter or waitress will be happy to share with you. A little flyer telling the story  tucked inside the menu would be nice. This is too special to go unappreciated. We have enjoyed dinner here so many times and never knew this until our friendly hostess pointed it out to us. If you're into storytelling, or have children along, don't fail to appreciate!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is way, way, way too casual and  unprofessional. I ordered a several items which were fine but then sushi roll, and a bug literally walked casually off my plate onto my napkin. I showed it to the bartender and the bartender said  \"that is just a fruit fly. It goes after sweet food\". Really?!   This time I got a whole new order sushi, and I took it to go. She said she was gonna tell a manager And the bartender said to me we went ahead and took it off of your bill As if they were doing me a favor. Never apologized. Then waited over 20 minutes for my replacement. Too long. I have visited over a dozen P F Chang's  around the country. This one is too reliant on traffic and people could literally fall from the casino into the restaurant. So I don't think they care about service or professionalism given they have so much easy traffic. May need to retrain some staff."}
{"text":"Ashley is amazing! So personable, attentive, and all her suggestions were on point! Sriracha and soy sauce in our egg drop soup tasted AMAZING! We would come back just for her! Thank you Ashley for an awesome dining experience!"}
{"text":"The bald guy with glasses that were seating people, RUDE. We were being seated and they planned to cram a party of 8 in 2 tables so we asked if we can get a larger one. We decided to wait and then we saw him seating 2 more parties ahead of us on the available tables which was originally for us and another one big enough for our parties. 15 minutes later a server asked us and he followed up on our tables. He then said \"You were already given a seat and you didnt take it\". Wow. So we were waiting for nothing."}
{"text":"Crispy honey shrimp, 1,000 calories plus, but darn good eatin'.  

If you want to make your tastebuds happy, you can here.  But any main dish worth chowing down on will dig into your calorie purse big time.  And don't get me started on desserts:  The rich and crazy chocolate and raspberry layered cake is nearly 3,000 calories.  The mini size is over 300 calories.  That's just a snack for someone like olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, but for the rest of us that spells diabetic coma. (Tip: Don't broadcast the calorie count of every single menu item.  Most people don't really want to know.)  

This location has a boomerang-like or half-circle set-up.  I liked it.  The bar was loud on a Friday night, but not crowded.  You're not going to hear your cell phone at all there.  

Drink-wise, I highly recommend the organic green tea, served hot.  That stuff is quality.  Also, their mojitos are fantastic: lots of lemon and mint, very refreshing and not too sweet.  

There were 6 of us at a huge table and we ate and gabbed for so long that the waiter did a cute little sit down and said hi and then got up quickly and left.  I thought he was being flirty and getting off of his feet for a second, but the more wise and knowing in our group realized he was politely saying \"beat it, we need to feed others.\" (Tip: it's called a lazy susan.  If you have a big group at a round table, you're gonna' see one of these.  We had zero lazy susan skills all night.  I think if you're going to drink, just be prepared to eat someone else's dish, or get dizzy trying to get to yours.)

I'm not a big fan of chains when dining in my home town.  I think chains can make the big, bad scary world of restaurants a teeny more comfy when traveling when you're feeling less adventurous.  But compared to Tempe's PF Chang's location, this one's better and you really can enjoy your meal here.  It's nice to see cars parked there that you will never be able to afford, or take a stroll past tempting shops nearby.

Note: If you are wheelchair bound or in a power chair, the table height at this location is high enough for you to eat like everyone else when seated at the table.  You don't have to be too far from your plate or too high up.  It's just right."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Very quick service. Waiter was friendly and gave us ideas on where to go. Knowledgeable on the surrounding areas. Food was perfect as always at any location."}
{"text":"Loved the California Roll, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Dumplings and Hot Saki...excellent service by Quinton, thanks!"}
{"text":"THIS IS TO BRI G. 
Can we take a minute to realize that an employee wrote back to a guest? If you would have told us this in person, this would have been a different story. Anyways Bri, you have to understand that dinner isn't a job appointment l, I'm sorry I wasn't on time. As for making other guest feel.comfortable why is that my concern?  I don't go to a restaurant thinking my arrival is a such a burden.  The minute we got there you were giving us attitude and treating us like a bunch of kids who came in to be rude, loud and have a purpose of being annoying. And before I forget, why were arguing with me about how many cups.of water were at the table? They were 4 people and 8 glasses of water. There's no excuse for taking someone's food too early, I've never seen that happen. There's a difference between asking the guest \"Any dessert for tonight?\" And \"any are we ready for free (whether they are or not) birthday dessert? And to top it off you came back with a bill saying you added 20 percent to the gratuity because of the trouble we put you thru..."}
{"text":"Just tried to eat there...5 people behind the hostess counter and no one greeted us..they wanted to seat us outside, which today is too cold for that..I asked for a booth which I was told was a 15 min wait..I said I was willing to wait, and we did.. Was lead to a table that was NOT A BOOTH.. During our wait noticed the health rating is currently 90.5..wow!! Waiting area floor nasty with trash and restaurant already seemed grimy.. We opted NOT to eat there after seeing their health rating..."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for happy hour in the bar. Not only do they have great drink and appetizer specials but their bartender Lexie is the best! She is not just helpful, but provides good conversation and many laughs."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were in a few weeks ago and I never had the chance to write a review. Our servers name was Torey and we've never been so impressed by a server before! We both work in the restaurant industry and were so pleased with our experience here. So blown away by our servers suggestions and attentiveness we left him a $50 tip on our $45 tab. Meant to talk to the manager on our way out but didn't have the time. Will definitely be returning hopefully to be sat in toreys section."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but the only thing authentic about this place is the word China in its name. Yes, I understand it's a chain, but not a large one so I would suggest spicing up your kitchen and serving less corporate chinese. I will give a better rating for the sole fact that I do like their lettuce roles but that's it."}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup was very warm and fresh. They say it is made daily from scratch. It is much better than the boil and dump dry soup I try to make from home. The vietnamese crab salad was not sour as described. The papaya is ripe and not green so the flavor is dulled."}
{"text":"Check In and was greeted by the best waiter in the gam Nathan great guy, and good was great service made us feel comfortable & added to the dining experience will return not only for the food but because of the hospitality"}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's is decent. Not great, not terrible, but decent. 

They have a large menu, so you have a lot of options to pick from. Like I said, everything tastes okay, but there's nothing special or noteworthy. 

The decor is very nice; a bit dark and intimate. 

On our most recent visit, our server was very good, but it took a ridiculous length of time to receive our food. 

Parking is in a large, free lot, though it can still often be difficult to find a space. 

Overall, you'll likely find more authentic and better tasting Chinese food at Hunan by the Falls or Ho Wah, two locally-owned Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Never again. This was my second time here, and it was a disaster, again. Never have I had so much anxiety having a meal. The first time the waiter put her hand in my friends food, and they brought the wrong food, however my food was wonderful. Tried again today with my husband, nope. The salad was nasty, iceberg with some dressing that tasted like onions. The wait was forever long, and the server was rude and irritated because we didn't like the terrible food. On top of that, I used a $25 gift card and the manager tried to tell me it was some kind of \"dine with us\" card so after the almost $22 bill there was nothing left on it. I mean 3 bucks is no big deal, but it's extremely annoying."}
{"text":"Hit and miss - just had a huge miss on my take out. Have been to other Changs that were good - apparently this one has kitchen issues. Waitstaff is nice.

Soggy egg rolls
Flavorless and mushy Won Ton Soup
Cold filling for chicken wraps, soggy rice noodles
Hard steamed rice.

Last time I was there, it was decent, hadn't been there for 2 years and thought I'd try it again. Yuck - complete bummer. Have had 3 misses so it's off our dining radar for good. Definitely go somewhere else - so many great restaurants in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I decided to dine at PF Chang's on 83rd Ave. It was not very busy at 8:30 on a Wed evening and we were attended to promptly. We decided to eat at the bar since the young lady tending the bar was very attentive and pleasant. I enjoyed a Dos Equis Lager and my wife had a  cosmopolitan which was exceptional, while perusing the menu. 

My wife settled on Won Ton soup to be followed by Hong Kong Sea Bass, I decided to have Hot and Sour Soup followed by Kung Pao Shrimp. 

Tragedy ensued: The Hot and Sour was neither Hot nor Sour. It was a dark brown compost of corn starch thickened soy sauce with pieces of chicken and mushroom although nothing but the salty soy was distinguishable. The Won Ton fared much better. The soup was a thin broth with lots of crunchy water chestnut, scallion and mushroom. It had a nice flavor. However; not one single Won Ton was to be found. Not One!

Next came our entrees. The Kung Pao was almost devoid of peanuts. It had quite a few hot red peppers along with I believe anoki schrooms and scallion. It would have been passable were it not for the fact that it was swimming in a thicker soy concoction than the Hot and Sour soup. It was inedible to me and my wife offered to swap her Sea Bass stating the Kung Poa was not good but doable. I ate about half of the expensive but mediocre Sea Bass (it was on the mushy side) and she ate less than half of the Kung Pao. The sweet bartender offered to exchange them for something else but we declined because we felt we could not expect better from anything coming out of that kitchen . This once very good venue is now, aside from the drinks, a garbage can! 

The bill came to $79.58 which we paid along with a nice tip for the nice Bartender.

I would rate it less than 1 star but that option is not offered."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate my service higher.  I have NEVER received such outstanding service as I did at the bar from Juan (I was there for dinner).  He was SO on top of his job.  The restaurant was packed and I could have been convinced I was the only person dining.
PF Chang's should be extremely proud of him and what he brings to the dining experience at this location.
The food was, as always, fantastic."}
{"text":"Second time here.  Ordered the meal for two. Food was delicious but portions small. Dessert was included in this special but portion limited for two individuals. Very slow service."}
{"text":"Oh my!  I'm so glad I went here for my birthday.  They were prompt in seating us.  Also, the waitress was very fast with taking our orders.  When the food came, it was piping hot!  First, egg rolls were big and tasty.  Then the egg drop soup was great!  I recommend it with those crispy noodles!  I ate the whole thing!  Then I had the Lo Mein!  It was a huge portion!  Great delicious meal!  Then for my birthday, I had my choose of free dessert.  I got the Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch Cake.  It was fantastic!  Love this restaurant!  The ambience is great!  The service was perfect!  And...I enjoyed my birthday dinner!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've never had an experience as bad as this. It was clear that other diners were experiencing similar issues around me. Was seated at a dirty table and waited 20 minutes before someone even came to clear it. My party of 2 placed our orders and waited an unreasonable amount of time. One order came back wrong and was sent back. Over 30 minutes went by, so my guest had to eat so that it didn't get cold. No waiter even came by to refill drinks or check in. Worst experience ever; we'll never be returning."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many restaurants the past 30+ years.  This is the first restaurant where I have to use a flashlight to read the menu.  The lighting inside this place is so dark like they are trying to save electric bill.  I ordered the beef plate with rice.  When my plate came out, the lighting was just too dark that I can't even see the texture of my food and my food just looks \"dark\"!  Maybe the poor lighting is a way to hide their plate presentation.  I am not alone in this.  There were guests that came in after me that they have to turn the flashing on the cell phone just to read the menu.  I'll eat at PF Chang again but never again in the evening.  Time to replace those lights with LED light to save electricity cost and crank it up so guest can actually read the menu and see their food."}
{"text":"This location is inside Planet Hollywood Casno.Always good service. I like to sit at the bar for a quick fix. Seasonal Menu is always worth a look along with the standard menu. Consistently open late."}
{"text":"I went 4 consecutive weekdays to find a 2 hour wait. \"Woah. This place must be awesome!\"

When we finally got in, we were not very impressed. I got a lobster sauce dish that was largely flavorless. About a year later, I decided to give it another try, thinking that maybe I had ordered the wrong thing. This time I stuck to more familiar territories and got some sort of bulgogi inspired dish that was being called out on the menu (I wish I remembered the name) and my husband got the Singapore Street Noodles. My dish tasted odd to me, with a very strong, bitter even, taste of orange zest. His was a bit better, but neither of us enjoyed it. I didn't even enjoy their crab rangoon, which I usually love. 

I have had authentic Chinese and Americanized Chinese food, all types of Asian cuisine...and somehow the fusion P.F.Changs delivers tastes odd to me, bland when it shouldn't be and too intense in others.

The staff and ambience are very nice, but ultimately the food is not simply not for me. Since then, I have been (affectionately) calling it P.F. Chunks."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this P.F. Chang's recently.  We enjoyed our visit and enjoyed our food.  Two things distinguished this from other P.F. Chang's we have visited: (1) the tables seem more crowded together (and since they all were full I presume that is because of the place's popularity); (2) they were out of the first three bottles of wine we ordered.  I tend to view chains negatively, and Chang's does nothing to dissuade me from that.  I am sure there exist good analyses of American chains doing ethnic foods, and I will let those speak for themselves.  The chain obviously is enormously popular, and this one does what it does well."}
{"text":"You hear quite often how people just LOVE this place.  I thought it was a regular Chinese restaurant on steroids.  We had a gift certificate so we took our friend there for his birthday.  The service was OK until we were done with our meals.  The empty, dirty plates sat on our table for a good 10 minutes while our server cleaned the tables around us.  I would be a little more understanding if it weren't close to closing time and those other dirty tables needed to be cleaned in order to be sat again, but it was about 30 minutes from close and 3/4 of the restaurant was empty. 

The food was ok.  Nee House is so much better though, without the hype.  Unless we have a gift certificate we wouldn't seek this place out."}
{"text":"Horrible!  We waited for over an hour for 3 gluten free fried rice dishes and one other dish.  Finally had to ask to see the manager.  He was stunned we were waiting. Many, many other tables had come and gone.  Our waitress never once came to our table to talk about the wait.  The manager then claimed it was because we had gluten free.  We eat at PF Changs often. This was not a gluten free - takes an hour issue.  It was a bad waitress and cook staff issue!  Will not go back to this location ever!"}
{"text":"Been going here since 2008, great place, great people , great food. The GM Matt is by far outstanding manager and has always take care of my family. We will continue going here for years to come. Thank you for the awesome service."}
{"text":"Every visit has been consistently great! Hostess is smiling and friendly and talks to you while escorting you to your table. Wait staff is attentive and eager to please. The lemon drop Martini is outstanding!  Food is hot and delicious.  This location has everything running smoothly!  A+"}
{"text":"This place was filthy and the service was awful!  This place has really gone downhill at least the manager was friendly."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the most popular franchise place in the north lake mall area. I love the Pai Thai they offered ,especially shrimp Pai Thai. Also the honey glazed shrimp is awesome. If you want to order take-out, call them or order online at least 20 mins earlier. I love their online ordering system, super convenient and easy to navigate."}
{"text":"Omg I can eat here everyday.  Always sooooo good.  Chicken Lettuce wrap on point as usual!  Puts traditional Chinese food to shame!"}
{"text":"I was here for a family members hockey tournament and we came in late and are quick. It was very busy but it was great service. The food did not take long at all being that we wanted to eat fast. I didn't have much money only about 25 dollars and I could easily find something on the menu! Every P.F. Changs I have been to has been fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went to P. F. Chang's during a recent trip to Vegas.  The restaurant is located inside  the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino.  I had eaten at a different P. F. Chang's before and had a comparable experience.  The food and service are consistently good, and the beer and wine selection is excellent (compared to other Chinese restaurants).  I would give this restaurant a solid 3.5 rating if you rate by half points."}
{"text":"Lemon peppered shrimp seasoned perfectly with some brown rice, fast service at lunch time."}
{"text":"I worked at Planet Hollywood for four years, so I ate here at least three or four times a month, and every time it was great. I really never noticed a markup from other Changs that are located off of the strip. The noodles, rice, and egg drop soup are all fantastic, whether eating at the bar or at a table. Service is quick and good, I would definitely recommend... especially compared to some of the other insanely priced placed to eat on Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"You think a girl who lived in LA would have gone to a PF Changs, but I thought how good could a large chain joint be? When my boss took me here it was really nice looking but I hate places that are too dimly lit so we sat outside. It was nice because we were the only ones in the section. Literally my only complaint could be that the food took too long. It could be, but it won't be. Because when it was taking too long the waiter brought us a free appetizer, a delicious vegetarian lettuce wrap. Then they offered us a free dessert of our choice. I had ordered the chicken sate because that's what I get from everywhere. The chicken was so delicious but the peanut sauce was the best I have ever tasted, nothing else has even come close! I was licking the bowl and wishing it was twice as big. The only thing that I was disappointed by was every time I get this it comes with a cucumber salad and this one came with a regular tiny salad. It's a little pricey but we more than made up for it in free food and even without it it would have been worth it."}
{"text":"So delicious. I recommend the chicken wraps, hot and sour soup and all their beef dishes I haven't been able to try the sushi cuz I'm pregnant but I'm sure it's fresh and delicious. Very upscale."}
{"text":"I may have ended up rating this place at about 2 stars had it not been for the fast, friendly and efficient service by our waitress.
Walked in for lunch, late afternoon (around 3 PM) on a Thursday and as expected the place was only ~20% full. However, had to wait 10 minutes to be seated!?!?
Did not bother to ask why since the hunger had overtaken the irritation
As mentioned in an earlier review, the menu is limited and does not offer the variety one would expect.
The appetizer portion sizes are below average and may leave you asking for more especially if you are planning to share.
The main course dishes we ordered did not have any sauce (it would have been nice to have been told this by the waitress) as it meant having semi dry food with steamed rice.
In terms of taste, I would rate the appetizers 4 stars and the main course 3 stars - they got the right spices but could have toned down the sweetness in some of the items.
Overall a good experience but not impressive per se."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night with family and we were sat down fairly quickly. Service was great for the most part, but the food was not.  I had the beef and brocolli and I have to note that the portion sizes have definitely shrunk. For 16 dollars I expect a lot more than what I got. Not to mention some of the meat was grissly and had pieces of fat. The sauce was really watery and filled my whole bottom of the plate . The brocolli was soaking in it.  The brown rice was lukewarm and not fresh.  Not going back again."}
{"text":"You know, it's taken me a longer time to jump on the PF Chang's bandwagon than everyone else.  I'm such a fan of takeout chinese, which Chang's isn't in the same class, but I've finally come around in the past couple years.

Chang's does wonderful job on flavors of sauces and meats.  The apps are really good as well.  We loaded up this past visit, of course everyone starts with the Lettuce Wraps, but the new Tuna Tataki Crisps and Flaming Red Wontons are great additions to the menu.

I don't think I've ever really had a dish I didn't like.  The Spicy Chicken and the new Caramel Mango Chicken were tops for the day.  The Sichuan Shrimp were impressive in size and flavor.

They all got washed down with Dark & Spicy's, Yuzu Ginger Mojitos, and Coconut Lemon Sours.

Finally to pig out we split the Chocolate Dome and Banana Spring Rolls!  Walked out sleepy with big ole' smiles and feeling to need to check our blood sugar!

Darn good thing we're all runners!

(Overall, the menu is so large that at times I have a hard time finding a new dish that would satisfy my meat and veggie craving.  I know that you can add veggies to any dish and you can add meat to any veggie dish.  I usually skip the rice all together.  Would be happy to see a veggie lo mein or something instead of the rice)

Have fun picking thru the menu!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my long-overdue first visit to P.F. Chang's and it was very satisfying. Went for lunch on a Friday and it was not very busy at all.

I'll get into the food in a bit, but first I have to applaud Chang's for their amazing service. Not only were they super-attentive and friendly but they helped us out so much. The thing is, my girlfriend is vegetarian and I am vegan so it's often hard to find a decent meal at restaurants that cater primarily to meat-eaters. We let our server know our dietary concerns and he was zipping back and forth to the kitchen (unbidden, mind you!) to find out what all was vegan. Usually when I dine out and ask \"Does this have _____ in it?\" or \"Is this vegan?\" I get an odd look and an unsure \"Yeah...that's totally vegan...\". It's hard to enjoy a meal when you aren't confident that there isn't some sort of strange animals bits lurking in it. You'd have to adhere to understand, but trust me. It sucks when you can't enjoy your food because there is that concern in the back of your mind.

Now on to the food...

We started with the tofu lettuce wraps which I had heard great things about. They were a bit salty for my tastes, but still very good. The addition of a crisp, cool sesame slaw would have taken this dish to the next level, but that's just me.

For the main course I got the coconut curry and my girlfriend got the ma po tofu. The coconut curry had all kinds of colorful vegetables and tofu topped with peanuts. It was alright, but no where near the same quality curry you'd get from Thai Basil or Swadee or Touch of Thai. But that's to be expected. After all, it's not a Thai restaurant.

The ma po tofu was HUGE. Large, sweet and saucy chunks of tofu wreathed in broccoli. Of the three things we tried, this was my favorite.

Oh, and they offer brown rice! Thank goodness because American really needs to get on the Whole Grain Train.

So there you have it. The vegan food is enough for me to *want* to return, but the great service pretty much guarantees that I will. I just hope the Chang's across the street from me in Chandler can match this location! If so, I'd be stunned.

UPDATE: Since posting this review I've visited both the Chandler and Tempe Chan'gs. Of the three Scottsdale is by far the best. Chandler location completely lost my business when they mixed chicken in with my tofu. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Unbelievably BAD service!!! Our waiter was terrible!  He forgot everything, took forever, no drink refills, no accurate order placement-he basically forgot about us (and his is Saturday at 4pm, not rush hour) no efficiency, the worst I have seen in a long time!  Food quality here is ok but I ordered the ahi tuna salad, lettuce looked old and gross.  Really everything on the menu is loaded with sugar and salt.  But the service was ridiculous, never going back!!!!!"}
{"text":"PF Chang's = Chinese food for non-chinese people. The last place I expected to finally try P.F. Chang's is in Las Vegas. My homie's gf wanted to go so I didn't protest. I decided to be safe and go for their famous lettuce wraps. I have to say the food was actually decent. The meat sauce wasn't too strong and the lettuce was very crispy. Portions weren't big but just enough to fill me up. At $8.50, it was the only reasonable value on the menu. What irks me is the rest of the menu. Almost everything else costs twice as much as it should. I realize the prices are gonna be high since Vegas Strip+chain restaurant=$$, but that doesn't make me feel any better about it."}
{"text":"I have been eating PF Chang's forever, well at lest the 16 years. Food was great here like normal, but the service sucks Planet Hollywood PF  :-(. Wish I would have said something to the manager but they were to busy :-( oh well. What is funny is we order a specialty drink and it wasn't delivered until after dinner wasn't done."}
{"text":"Terrible service. After we sat down our server stopped to say hi and we sat for 15 minutes until we walked out. It wasn't busy. There were plenty of other servers working so they weren't short handed. If you have the decency to say hi get our drink order. We were only a table of 2. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Can't go wrong. Lettuce warps were the best."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food compared to the other restaurants in the area.  I like that they use white meat chicken instead of dark meat.  That said this particular PF Changs is the worst I've ever been to.  The quality has gone down and it seems greasier and greasier every time.  I won't order any of the noodle dishes here because they're just full of grease.  The other negative are the prices, about twice as expensive as any other Chinese restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"This place could have gotten a better score but for the service. Our server was fine yet they have a lot of bad habits. The trey stands they park in front of your table while they clean another, so you sit eating and looking at other peoples dirty dishes so close to you that you are more than a little annoyed.

Got the ahi tartar to start. This came out on wontons that were two bite size. Tried picking up and eating and they fell apart, tried to cut and they fell apart. They sent 5 to a table of two. Who gets the fifth one? Not well designed. Tuna was cut to big. I would suggest a smaller taco shaped wonton. Just sayin.

The two entrees were ok with the one bowl of rice that I could have fit in a half cup measure. The building I heard was just renovated but they had sheet rock dust every where and it seemed a little unfinished. For the 90 dollars we spent I could have gotten better at tintin for50. Won't be back.

The Bloody Mary was good."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a cocktail. They were good but bartender was not paying attention to what was ordered."}
{"text":"very crowded. definitely should have made reservations, we waited for about an hour. dumplings were good as starters, six small pieces. then i had the kung pao chicken but was dissappointed that there were no vegetables in it, none. it  tasted good but not what i was expecting. my friend ordered pepper steak which looked more delicious :)"}
{"text":"used to wait hours for food here a few years ago

second visit in 6 months -  kung pao shrimp was very salty

very good service

great wall cake still very good - kids will not leave without having it"}
{"text":"For our Mother's Day dinner, I placed an order for two Lemon Grass Chicken Salads and Beef Fried Rice from P.F. Chang's and sent my son to pick it up. When he arrived home with it, our salads were missing the chicken. I called the restaurant and was asked if I wanted to return the salads. I said that I would like to have the chicken delivered. I was then put on hold for several minutes after which the manager came on the line. She asked me to repeat my order and gave us the good news that someone from P.F. Chang's would indeed deliver the chicken for our salads. However, when they arrived we were absolutely blown away by their generous delivery: they not only brought us two new complete salads and fried rice, but also chocolate cake and a $25 gift card. They went above and beyond what was expected to keep our business. Not many places would do that these days. Thank you P.F. Chang's!"}
{"text":"We eat here often and last night we had a great experience. Normally we sit at the bar but last night we chose to sit at a table in the dining room instead. Brandon was our server-he was meticulous and very knowledgable of the menu. Next time we will ask for his section-you should too!"}
{"text":"Always Busy, the best suitable word for this location of PF Changs. 
Me and my wife have been many times here now and we love the Firecracker Shrimps with Veggie Dumplings pan fried which is just slurpy n mouth watering..
Service is great. Would love to say that ask for Gordon and I bet you will be delighted by his services. He is a very professional and one of the best servers I have ever interacted with in food industry.

We r coming every time here. You guys are awesome."}
{"text":"We were recently here and enjoyed it immensely. My wife and I always have the lettuce wraps. These are to die for. We have yet to have a pleasant experience that any PF Changs. The staff particularly at this restaurant with very helpful in helping the tourist around Vegas. It is a tad smaller than your average Changs but it's a great place especially to get out of the heat. This is Steve justce getting lucky in Vegas. Signing off."}
{"text":"Always great! Had the best dinner and service last night. Our server Ruben was awesome! He was cool and friendly and took good care of us. The food was delicious as always! Never a bad time or meal!"}
{"text":"I give them a 5 star review based on the pan fried dumplings alone.  I can eat them by the pound.  The Mongolian beef and sea bass are fantastic as well.  Great restaurant..."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to PF Changs! Love the fact that they brought my daughters meal out first was a huge win! We were able to help her eat her food so we could enjoy our entrees. The pan fried pork dumplings were amazing! My wife ordered the crispy honey chicken & I ordered the chicken pad Thai. Both entrees were fantastic with more than enough left over. For dessert chocolate peanut butter crunch! We were also given a $10 off coupon for our next visit."}
{"text":"I usually like the food and experience at PF Changs, however this location is not quite so.. the service is soooooooooo slooooooow... Came here for lunch during the week and it took forever for the orders to be placed, the food to arrive and also to get the check . the food was really oily and salty... Not going back again..."}
{"text":"Although they offer high prices on the dinner items, especially the Fish dishes, and initially the Server seemed a bit Snooty---the food was delicious! We were first time visitors, and we ordered the Fried Rice Combo and the Shrimp Lo Mien ( served with our choice of Soup or Mixed Salad Greens) off the Lunch Menu.

I was surprised that hot tea was not complimentary (it cost an additional $3.50 per pot). And I was surprised that lower sodium items were not available. Also, I didn't know that there was a P.F. Changs in the Cleveland area--until I drove by this one in Beachwood. 

Previously, I tried their frozen entrees, which are available in high end grocery stores. The food in the restaurant tastes a lot better. Additionally, as the afternoon progressed, the Server was friendlier and by the end of our meal, I found him to be very professional. Additionally the Manager stopped by our table. She was friendly and professional as well!

I love the building's beautiful architecture and big, unique statues--both outdoors and inside. And I love the beautiful sink and the overall decor in the Ladies' Restroom.  All in All, we had a great experience, and we will return soon!"}
{"text":"Curtis our waiter was very patient and helpful and when we accidentally ordered something that wouldn't work with my friends dietary restriction he easily and quickly replaced it with a good recommendation. He knows the menu really well which is refreshing. 

I've been to lots of PF Chang's before but this location appears to be particularly well run."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and reasonably priced. But the priced went up lately and portion sizes have gone down. Food is inconsistent and I've found hairs and other things in my food before."}
{"text":"How is this place so popular?? I received a gift card to PF Chang's for Christmas.  I had never been before and was excited to try it out.  Tried going last Saturday and the wait was 2 hours.  That is outrageous.  So the following Saturday still wanting to use the gift card, we made reservations.  We were seated on time at 8.  (FYI, the wait without reservations was 1.5 hours).  

We were completely unimpressed with the food.  I couldn't even finish my Sesame chicken, it was just not good.   The flavor was kind of strange, and not spicy as described. The portions were EXTREMELY small.  

I'm shocked that this place is so busy given the poor quality of food.  I will never go back.  

My favorite Chinese place in Pittsburgh is Sesame Inn.  They put PF Chang's to shame.  Everything on their menu is absolutely delicious, portions are generous and I've never waited more than 10 mins for a table."}
{"text":"First timers, I took the family (wife and three girls) here and we LOVED it. Half-price happy hour appetizers (ribs, enamame and spring rolls) were great. Dinner was excellent as was the service. Got out for $100 + top! which is good value. After a week in Scotsdale, trust me, this is good value. Would def go back; great spot!,"}
{"text":"I've always had good service here. Im not terribly fond of the food but its okay. The fried rice is certainly my favorite. The beef dish I had, had really dry meat. It was edible but not fantastic. The egg drop soup is good. They're really gluten free friendly, which makes it the ideal place to go to supper with a friend of mine."}
{"text":"Come here almost once a month and order the same entree the waiters are always friendly and very accommodating. We've never waited over 20 mins to be seated, which is awesome because we usually go on weekends. 

The menu selections are cool I already know what to expect. And they seem to frequently put new items on the menu.  But I do get tired of that same pre-meal soup, although I do like that soup. My go to dessert is the banana spring rolls with the coconut pineapple ice-cream.YUM"}
{"text":"Ok, so I admit it, I LOVE Asian food...and I have to say, I've tried quite a few different places...so I honestly expected sooo much more from this place because people always say its \"amazing\" and the \"best Chinese food ever\"...Boy was I in for a surprise. 
So my Bf and I arrived a lil later on in the night, and the place looked nice...busy, and cozy, but when I saw the prices on the menu ( Which I was warned would be a lil outrageous) I was expecting that the food would be sprinkled in edible gold!! :)
Luckily they had a menu perfect for a couple..a \"prefix menu\" with many different options for under $40. Ok, not too shabby...The waiter was good..my bf drinks like a beast, and his cup was always filled, and my mouth was anticipating our tasty meal...
and then it showed up. 
Honestly, I don't see the hype. I have had BETTER Chinese takeout!!!!!!!! The Lo mein was not very flavorful, the mongolian beef was extra crispy it had turned chewy and stiff,and it was super salty!!! yuck!!! The only dish that attempted to save the meal was the honey shrimp..the shrimp was juicy and fresh! Dessert was our choice of cake shoved in a shot glass, and even that didn't turn my frown upside down \"(
Would I come here again??.... Probably not..unless I wasn't paying for it. And even with that, I would be willing to try new dishes, but I don't feel there is anything worth my $15.95 a dish."}
{"text":"Took my mom to dinner to this location. I ordered the beef salad with noodles and when i received my order my salad had no noodles even though it was part of the on-tray name.  Our waitress was great with us but i have to admit I've been to other locations in Vegas and this one does not impress me like the one in summerlin. don't really think I,m going back."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this place impresses. Great menu selection, quality food and if you like spicier dishes, the menu clearly identifies which dishes could be for you. 

If you're a dessert person, try the chocolate dome, it's a flourless mound of deliciousness."}
{"text":"In October 2014, friends & I met at this location for drinks & dinner. Our experience was so bad I emailed PF CHANGS a complaint at the table, while Daniel acted like a 2 year old.  PF CHANGS responded requesting additional information; below is what I sent them. It should be important to note I also emailed Daniel's boss, some area manager whose response was simply \"sorry about that; I will use your experience in an upcoming training session.\"  

Upon receipt of PF CHANGS gift card that was emailed to me...1 $25 e-card for 3 people...2 of us went to redeem it & the server had to get a manager involved; Daniel immediately recognized me, was a total arse, and I was shocked our food wasn't poisoned. 

It has taken me this long to write this review because I have been so bothered by it.  While we will never return, it's important for others to know you will have problems at this location and the unprofessional management will make a bad situation worse. The whole point was giving them a chance to redeem themselves. BLEW. IT. 

**
Just so you know, our initial complaint originated at the bar during happy hour.  The bartender was not pleasant, which I suppose we can look past. Let's be honest, we all have our off days while at work. However, my mate and I had ordered the Pinot Grigio off the happy hour menu and prior to the end of the hour we ordered another round. The bartender told us they were \"completely out\" of ALL Pinot Grigio's in the restaurant and made no additional suggestions. Once seated at our table, and about 45 minutes later (it took us awhile to order because we were busy talking and not paying attention to the menu), we mentioned our bar experience to our server Lawrence who informed us they did have Pinot Grigio in stock and quickly brought us a glass. 

Dumbfounded, that is when we asked for the manager.  My mate wasn't even 5 words into her sentence when the manager Daniel interrupted her and boldly announced they were out of ALL Pinot Grigio, that an hour beforehand HE told the bartender to stop sales of it which is why we were told they were completely out of it. He went on to say the bartender did nothing wrong as he was following HIS command. Yes, the manager used that word.  When I pointed out we were just brought a glass of Pinot Grigio and questioned how could that be if they were out, he interrupted me and said we were brought a Pinot Gris. Which is not what we ordered (nor was it deducted from our bill).  It was at that point we asked he leave our table as I wrote the complaint you received. (I mentioned to Daniel as he placed his hands on his hips & stomped away I was writing the complaint. \"do it. See if I care!\" Was his response.)

My mates and I were there for several hours and our server Lawrence was beyond exceptional.  We might have left had it not been for him.  Daniel's total lack of professionalism, disrespect, and immaturity displayed towards us was repeatedly apologized for by Lawrence. While appreciated, it was not his place to apologize for the epic fail on behalf of this manager.  Of note, during our time at the restaurant, the manager stood at the pass and glared at us the rest of the night.

Aside from the shock we felt by the way your manager spoke AT us as well as his behavior, what I find most disturbing about this experience is that the he sent Lawrence to our table with a $30 gift card as his way of apologizing. The manager should have brought this to us himself, not send it over with Lawrence.  Reluctantly we took it and while on our way out, I discarded it."}
{"text":"I love PF Changs. After numerous fails in Henderson this past year I happened to be in Summerlin AND craving some combo fried rice so in I went. 

Sunday afternoon. Lot appeared to be full but when we walked in we were immediately greeted by the nicest hostess I've met. We were seated promptly and soon greeted by our server. 

I won't go into details of every little thing...but the service we received is what I expect whenever I go out for a meal. I walked in with very low expectations and left thoroughly pleased. 

While I forget his name, our server was very on top of everything & was attentive to our needs. We never had to ask for anything. His tip reflected how appreciative I was of the service he provided. 

While I will never step foot in Henderson again, I will be back here. Just not as often as I would like."}
{"text":"We found the food to be subpar and wildly overpriced (c'mon, guys, fifteen to twenty bucks for an entree that goes for $8 to $12 at most other places?). Bland, uninteresting lettuce wraps; mango chicken on the bitter side; Singapore street noodles that would never have made it in Singapore except perhaps as fodder for livestock. How this place established such a favorable reputation is quite beyond me - no one in our party was a bit impressed.

Service was the high point of the visit. Our gal was was totally on the ball, fast, friendly and professional. But outstanding service doth not a successful outing make, and I have no plans to return. There are so many other interesting Asian places around for so much less money."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I have had a restaurant of this chain. Half of order was never served and a cocktail set on the serving bar until we had to ask for it again which was after half of meal had already been eaten. The explanation was the bar was busy but we could see the drink setting on the service bar waiting to be served. The explanation for the food was a new menu item and cooks were having problems. Why weren't they trained is my question. In addition we had ordered the same items weeks before at a different PF Chang's with no problem.  How long does it take to train s staff. The whole experience was actually less than one star. We actually left and had dinner at a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible service! The waitress was extremely slow even slower after we mentioned we were catching a movie.  We had to practically jump up and down waving our arms to call her over.  It honestly looked as if she would serve other tables and avoid eye contact at our table and pretend we weren't calling her just so she could go to the kitchen. 

As for the food most everything tasted pretty salty especially the double pan-fried noodles...YUCK!  BUT, if you're into ALL that SALT  I guess go.

P.s.  We were harassed by a homeless person from the parking lot all the way to the front door walkway."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Told our waiter we needed to get to a show in 40 minutes and we were walking out in 30. The lo mein is a must"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about PF Changs that I love so much, but I do. So it's disappointing when the location literally across the street from my house (Green Valley) fails SO miserably I have to drive across town to eat at one. THIS location does not disappoint. 

Valet parking at Miracle Mile & a quick walk through the mall makes for easy access. Located inside Planet Hollywood it's a bit hidden inside the casino if you're not entering on foot from The Strip. Running the perimeter of the casino, it's located next to the PH Rewards desk. 

Huge bar & seating area. Looks like there's an upstairs section as well. Our server was attentive & very nice. Our iced teas stayed filled without being asked. Absolutely no complaints. Our lunch, shrimp potstickers & combo fried rice, was plenty for two. It was an enjoyable weekday lunch. 

If only I could remember our servers name!!  We inadvertently left our credit card behind and he chased us through the casino to return it to us. Now that's service & honesty. My friend in town for business could have been left in a huge pinch had our server not done this. Our appreciation couldn't be expressed enough...and he refused any additional tip for doing this. While I can't remember his name, I remember his face and will definitely ask to be seated in his section the next time I'm in and see him working. Truth be told, this act alone warrants the 5-stars and my repeat business."}
{"text":"Got free crab wontons because I mentioned I was a yelper. Told them I would report they had cockroaches (being sarcastic) free food haha. Staff was friendly :)"}
{"text":"Ok... so this is real chinese food, but I'm not in china and I like the americanized version.  Had a large group and PF has big tables.  Was really good food, good prices feed 12 for less than 250.  

Nice crowd... although there was a guy at the table next to us with a \"Pimp\" cup... a big crazy jewel encrusted grail???? Couldn'd understand why? but hey..."}
{"text":"One star for the good lettuce wrap dish. However, my party and I waited for our meal almost for an hour and our meals came in warm and overcooked. While we were eating, one of my friend's meal has a piece of hair.  Although, we don't have to pay for the meal we ate, but we have to pay for the lettuce wrap. My party and I did not enjoy our first meal of the New Years Day in Vegas. Double thumbs down."}
{"text":"I would have to say that this was one of the best meals i have ever eaten. I had scallops and my mom had shrimp and lobster. We also had a monkey shoulder whiskey drink in honor of Chinese New year...absolutely delish.. Hunter the server was an absolute treasure.. we got everything he suggested and it was divine. Patrick S..the manager was also super nice and personable. I would totally go here again..."}
{"text":"My family often come here for dinner and we were pretty satisfied with the food! 

We ordered and shared our usual: the Mongolian Beef ($16.50), the Orange Peel Chicken ($13.95), and the Stir-fry Eggplant ($9.75). In addition to these dishes, we decided to try something new; the Ma Po Tofu ($11.50). The chicken, beef and eggplant where spot on, and So I highly recommend these dishes. They were delicious with great flavor. However, the Mo Po tofu was a bit more on the salty side. The tofu came with steamed broccoli which I appreciated because eating the tofu with the broccoli balanced out the saltiness of the tofu a little. 

Overall, I enjoyed most of the dishes I ordered from P.F. Changs and I will surely return!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had the best lettuce wraps every
Had a discount buy one entrée full price get next 4:00 
Wow the food and services was totally amazing 
Husband i will go back for date night"}
{"text":"We went there last Sunday and had a great experience. The only mildly negative was the hosts didn't bring any kids menus to the table and we had to go up and ask for them. Other than that, I was really impressed with the server, he was informative, made great suggestions and was attentive. The food was well cooked and hot. The server did forget to ring in a side for me and instead of blaming the kitchen he went out of his way to admit his mistake so I appreciate his honesty. Needless to say, we will not hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"We had a happy hour here last night and had the best time. There were seven of us and we had requested individual checks so we knew that the server would need to be on top of his game.  And Marcus was just that.   He was able to keep up with all the  orders even when several guests were a bit late.   He kept the water filled and the orders were filled in a timely manner.   The manager, Andrew, had our table ready on time and every thing was done to perfection.  Loved every minute of our evening.   Well done."}
{"text":"Worst service I have had in a long time. This place has really gone down hill. We were there for two hours. We placed our order as soon as we sat down and it took forever. Waiter didn't refill my drink one time. Took around 20,min to pay credit card machine was down. I felt like I was in red robin about 100 kids in there. Overpriced crappy service played out restaurant. Waiter came by table one time. Joke for nice place. I rather go to olive garden and get good service."}
{"text":"Horrible...   went here and spent over $140 on three people.    One of the people I paid for got sick from the food.    I will never be back to this location due to this incident."}
{"text":"Great service!!! Average tasting food. I personally prefer the taste of my hometown \"happy china\" and was disappointed because it was talked as if it was soooo superior but it wasn't bad at all. It had a ritzy feel and everything was really nice and clean. Service was great!!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter took our order 37 minutes after we were seated. When our food finally arrived it was cold. This Changs has be pretty good in the past but we won't be back"}
{"text":"Have to give them all stars on this.   Food was perfect except one item.   Tabitha our waitress took it on her own to express to the manager Robert of our small displeasure with the one dish. ..and Robert very politely apologized for the issue and without any prompting took care of that particular charge and we both left with the feeling (being business owners ourselves) of confidence and desire to return.   Very professional."}
{"text":"We had the 2 person prix fixe, choosing soup: hot and sour (awful), appetizer: chicken lettuce wraps (reliably good), entrees: Mongolian beef (slightly sweet, pretty oily, mostly yummy), chilean sea bass (very good-- this fish is hard to mess up), desserts: chocolate cake and tiramisu (small and mass produced in shot glass sized cups).   The additional order of fried rice was decent.  Had I not been given a gift certificate, we never would have ended up here, but it turned out OK.  Bartender was awesome in getting me my drinks just in the nick of time to take advantage of their happy hour specials, but it was a bit of a disappointment that I couldn't stick the drink tab onto my restaurant tab.  Apparently the two parts of the restaurant do separate accounting.  Weird."}
{"text":"Had dinner here, this location always seems to have a million people in it but it was easier for my friend from out of town to get to this one from the Hard Rock. Love the shrimp with the candied walnuts and melon, we also had pad Thai. Service was fine except waiter smelled like cigs so we knew he had just come back from a smoke break. Please put on a jacket or something when you do because smelling cigarette when your waiter comes to check on you, especially when you are trying to eat is not a good look....or smell!... We finished dinner and had drinks elsewhere."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant but this is the worst location to go to. Wanted to have a nice lunch date with my husband... But it was ruined when the actual servers sat in the booth next to us (mind you the whole side of the restaurant we were on was empty and they sat next to us). They proceeded to complain about the tables they were serving...how bad their tips were... Etc. loved that the manager actually joined in and sat at the table too. Incredibly unprofessional. Usually employees are required to eat their lunch in a closed section not around actual paying customers! 
Seriously go somewhere else and not this restaurant! Try Houston's on Scottsdale road. Always good food and good service!"}
{"text":"This is best PF Changs in Vegas, as far as service and food,
We goto all of them, and this location is most pleasant.

Idvsat the worst one for service is not the planet Hollywood location, however it's the stand alone flamingo/paradise location. Poor service 
And lots of fast paced activity with loud noises, not a relaxing PF Changs, the mangers at charleston location are the best!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here but the service was horrible and I needed to keep asking for water refills. But the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"I want to give PF Chang's 3.5 stars.  I am not a \"fan\" but, I am more than \"A-Ok\".  

Friends and I went to the PF Chang's inside Planet Hollywood Resort for lunch.  Have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. It was my first time dining at PF Chang's.  The dishes were pretty good.  I thought it was going to be a \"dumb-it-down\" or a tourist trap Asian themed restaurant.  Come on, its a chain restaurant in Vegas. 

4 stars for the restaurant staff.  The wait staff were super awesome and super attentive.  The manger walked around to each table and asked if everything was okay and checked on the customers periodically.  

Had a nice one hour smoke-free lunch with friends.  What more could I ask for? *coughing*coughing caused by the cigarette smoke from the casinos area*"}
{"text":"My first P.F. Chang experience has me behaving like a drug addict trying to relive my first high.  I've eaten at several in several different cities and it's consistently mediocre.

This location could've been cleaner.  The table next to us ordered lettuce wraps and the lettuce was dirty, so the sent it back.  The prices are also higher because you're on The Strip."}
{"text":"The *!ONLY!* reason this place is getting four stars is because of the staff.  The hostess sat us right away at a clean table because we didn't get all picky about seating.  Our waiter instinctively knew when to show up and when to leave us alone.  he was there to refill drinks, take plates but never hovered our interrupted us while we were chewing.

Oh the food!!  *facepalm* -_- Seriously fire the chef.  I know it gets busy but the flavor and the food should not have to suffer.  The first thing we had were the lettuce chicken cups for an appetizer.  This was ok but very greasy. 

My dish was the shrimp and vietnamese noodles.  The bowl came out looking the opposite of the picture in the menu.  The noodle were gray and way too much of them.  The shrimp and some type of meat protein were kind of hidden under the mound of noodles and were sparse and overcooked.  There was no flavor to this dish at all.  Bleh!

My friend ordered orange chicken and rice.  I had a bite.  Still no flavor.  Even the rice was bland which is weird because Asians flavor their rice with salt at least.  Whomever is heading the kitchen obviously does not care about p.f. Chang's cooking reputation or the food in general.  

This experience was sad because #1. here is Las Vegas it is so very hard to find good Asian fusion food in general, and #2. It was my very first time at p.f. Chang's and sadly the last.  I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this restaurant several times. Aside from a few hiccups, service has usually been good, including at other locations. However, two nights ago...not so much. We were seated pretty quickly despite the crowded atmosphere but to this moment, I have NO idea who our server was that night. We sat there for thirty plus minutes watching as the tables to our left and right and rear were served, drinking, and enjoying their night. A server walked around us to give refills and later...to give and collect the bills for those tables. My husband tried to get another woman's attention who was dressed in a different black uniform....no such luck. She walked past us as well a few times with an igniter...totally engulfed in keeping the candles on the tables lit in the back of the restaurant. Now, when we first sat down, we heard the kitchen manager or owner (suit and tie) come out and tell the table to our left that they just got a new POS SYSTEM and he was sorry for the wait on the food. That's understandable. What is not understandable is how 30 MINS can pass and we receive NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, NO EYE CONTACT,NO DRINK ORDER TAKEN, or at the very least a simple, \"HEY, I'M YOUR SERVER AND I'LL BE OVER AGAIN AS SOON AS I CAN.\"  Common courtesy courtesy does courtesy does NOT  require the usage of a POS system. 
We got up and left, letting the hostess stand know that they had a free table, as we were out of there and told her why. My husband asked for management and - would you believe it - the candle woman was indeed management!! This explained lit because the leader always sets the tone. We told her what happened and I pointed out to her that she too had walked by us a few times and my husband tried to get her attention (has a strong voice) and was ignored by her. She wanted us to come to the bar and get \" taken care of\" right then and not to leave. We let her know we wanted them to be aware this was happening and did NOT WANT FOOD. I know people assume fussy patrons just want free food, but not all of us... We were given this 10 dollar gift card and an I'm sorry.  Frustrated and starving we left and spent our hard-earned money elsewhere at the Cheesecake Factory on a nice 3 course dinner. We had to wait for a table...but NOT for good service. They BEAT PF Chang's on every level and we will be back THERE again.  PLS retrain your staff on service. Knowing the menu means nothing if you cannot serve EVERYONE EQUALLY who enters your section. Not cool!!"}
{"text":"Our boss took us to dinner here. if you're in Las Vegas and you want to go to PF Changs this is the one to go. It's close off the strip and it's not in the casino. The customer service here is awesome everyone from the time you walk in to when you walk out is very kind and courteous, our server knew the menu and knew how to help us in choosing our dinner and drinks. You must try the honey walnut shrimp with the honeydew balls delicious! I will definitely come back to this one"}
{"text":"We are a fan of PF Chang's but not sure about this location.

The restaurant is beautiful and decorated with class.  There is a really nice patio area for those that like to eat outside.  We have been going to PF Chang's for a very long time and have been to many locations in multiple states.

The food is still of very high quality and although the portions are smaller than they once were, that is really not a bad thing.  Won ton soup and spring rolls are our favorite appetizers.   The soup was outstanding but could have been hotter.  The spring rolls were brought out right out of the fryer (as they should have been) and were great.  One thing that was different at this location was that the server did not serve the first cups of the won ton soup.  This was not a big deal, just different than we were used to-- this was with the large bowl order.   

I have also been to the Summerlin location recently and noticed that at the Summerlin location, the sauce cups to be mixed to the diners' tastes are still brought to each table.  However, we were really surprised to see that the sauce cups are not used at this Henderson location, nor were we even asked if we would like the sauces.  We also did not notice any other table with the sauce cups.

PF Chang's no longer has the chicken with black bean sauce on the menu which used to be my husband's favorite.  He got the honey chicken which he really liked.  I had the chicken lettuce wraps for my entrée which were of course excellent although the dish was not as hot as it should have been.  The atmosphere is really nice and we enjoyed our meal.  Our server was Andrew and he did a good job-- the only disappointment was that he took way too long to bring my husband a second cup of coffee which was requested before dessert arrived and was not brought to the table until after dessert was finished.

For dessert my husband chose the apple cobbler and I asked for the deconstructed berry shortcake.   A suggestion for PF Chang's would be to serve your desserts in the dishes and in the format as is pictured on your menu.  It is very disappointing to get something completely different looking than what you were expecting, although once we tried the desserts, we were happy with them.  About the coffee - my husband thought it was excellent (rich dark roast); however, the first cup was not hot enough and he enjoyed the second cup which was nice and hot, more than the first.

On our way out, we both stopped in the restrooms.  I was highly disappointed and disgusted with the state of the women's restroom.  The toilet looked like it had not been cleaned in weeks; the restroom in general was dirty and looked in need of repair and regular maintenance.  I have never been in a PF Chang's restroom that was filthy, ever, before this one.

I don't know that we will go back to this location."}
{"text":"I had just left the  masjid where I attend for both Friday prayer and daily prayers and met with some friends on the way to Changs and I decided to tag along . I loved it. The dynamite shrimp was perfectly cooked and Matt our server was attentive but not intrusive  and was really respectful of my religious situation  . A diverse crowd and some great brotherhood. Thank you Changs and thank you Matt enjoyable nice time ."}
{"text":"This location was a let down from any other PF's I been too. The orange chicken looked and tasted like it had been under a heat lamp for days. The salmon was flavorless and asparagus soggy. I felt like I put my money right into the toilet, grabbed a swish stick, and watched it go down. If the food was what I'm used to from other locations the following would not be so much a problem, this location is the size of postage stamp. Poor outdoor area and very cramped inside. Makes for a loud environment that kills any ambiance."}
{"text":"Celebrated our wedding anniversary and they were great . They also had great knowledge of their celiac menu"}
{"text":"Went in, ordered the filet...asked for veggies instead of potatoes.  Order came with less than half of my daughters order... asked what the veggies were, she said the tomatoes...I had 6 total mini tomatoes...the server was rude and snippy.  Tab for 3 was $91 and the attitude ticked me off...I will not be back."}
{"text":"I have some favorites dishes at PF Changs, so I stopped in for dinner. I asked to sit at the bar since I was solo and the place was busy. They seated me at a second bar located upstairs. I was the only one at the bar.
What I liked: the consistent menu choices
The bartender
The Mongolian Beef
What I didn't like: 
Very noisy place
Sushi - only average
Sake selection - limited
Staff - there is service elevator right next to the bar. The staff hangs around this area, talks loudly, and seemingly are oblivious that patrons are trying to enjoy their meal. Some serious training and management oversight is needed here. 
I love PF Changs, but this is my least favorite one. 
Ps: Yelp reviews are biased toward paid advertisers."}
{"text":"Fantastic. I ordered the candied shrimp looking to try something new. Wow it was so good. I was blown away. Definitely recommend trying it.

Service was excellent and overall a great experience. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I would definitely not recommend it to anyone anymore. This is yet another time I faced horrible service. 1st off, waited for about an hour for the food to arrive and no one even cared to come and talk to us about it. Second, we ordered 3 drinks and given 4. We ordered 2 shrimp fried rice and 1 chicken. We did get 2 of the shrimp 1st and after waiting for another 20 mins, got the chicken one (for the person in our group who avoids shrimps), which had shrimp at the bottom. Ok mistakes might happen, but when we asked about this, the waiter simply waived it off saying \"I ordered whatever you guys asked for, the kitchen messed it up, and it wasn't my fault\". I wish I could get up and leave right away.
I would have given a minus -1 star if that option was available. This was my second if not third (if I could remember correctly) with PF chang's.

Please either shut down the customer service or improve for God's sake."}
{"text":"We were so expecting to have to wait forever to get a table, but we were seated right away.  
We chose the 2 for $44 which comes with soup, app, 2 entrees, and dessert.  We got the egg drop soup and it was fantastic.  Next we ordered the steamed pork dumplings (recommended by the waiter)...flavor was good but I have a feeling they would have been better fried.  We chose the Spicy Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken for the entrees.  The Spicy Chicken was excellent, but the Kung Pao was dry. It just seemed like it needed a sauce with it.  
The dessert was good...nothing to rave about, but we enjoyed it.  
I will come back here, not so much for the food, but the atmosphere.  The wait staff was wonderful, food came out super fast, and it was just a nice place to sit and relax."}
{"text":"- First time here
- Customer service is good
- Food horrible:  I order combo fried rice and tuna appetizer
             - rice was really greasy
             - meat was too salty and dry( like beef stick texture)
             - tuna tasted old, like it sat out for a while.
- Food taste like it came  frozen pre-cooked in microwave
- Only finished 1/4 of food( try to get money worth)



- Went to a nearby Chinese take out shack that look like a dump and the fried rice there was 10 times better(Thai basil). Pork n mushroom at Chang Jiangs was tasty! I went to Thai basil and Chang Jiangs for lunch and dinner, give them 5 star."}
{"text":"The food tasted good but nothing extraordinary. Also, if you're going to order any kind of food that has sauce... try to just order one... all their food with sauce will taste the same. It's like they're using the same secret ingredient for all their food. 

Also, if you're going here... expect delays. It's like the servers hate doing their jobs. It takes them forever to take orders, to give you your check, to clean the tables, etc.  I'm not sure if they're all just being lazy or they're just not properly trained. It's not even busy. 

I would never go back or recommend this place. There are better Asian Resto with better customer service."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were around the green valley ranch casino looking to try out some new food! We parked by PF Changs since the whole parking lot was pretty crowded. As we walked past PF Changs I could smell what they were cooking and I said \"Hey, it smells pretty good\". After walking around looking at the shops for awhile we decided to head back over by PF Changs to eat. 

We walked in and one of the hosts rolls her eyes at me! Then another hosts gives us some waiting tool thing and we ended up waiting for about 20 minutes. The hosts seemed to be laughing and joking around in front of people, which gave me the impression that this place tried too hard with their decorations, dimmed lights and lit candle at each table, but hired young people who didn't have any professional demeanor!  

We sat at our table and our waiter came up and asked us what we wanted to drink.Then after 15-20 minutes he comes back and takes our order, I order the orange chicken and my boyfriend ordered some beef  (I forgot the name). The orange chicken tasted like Dawn dish washing soap, and the beef tasted way too strong. My boyfriend said the taste was stuck in his mouth and he tried to wash it down with Coca-cola, that didn't work, then we took a quick drive to Walmart to get him some mouthwash cause he couldn't stand it, The whole travel size bottle of mouth wash didn't get the taste out of his mouth even!!!!!!! Then we got some ice cream, and that sort of helped, but the taste came back and he had to go home to brush his teeth like three times, the taste was still there the next morning, and he had to repeat the process! This was the worst experience i've ever had at a restaurant. Me or my boyfriend won't ever go back!"}
{"text":"I went to this place because of the award that they recieved for best cocktail menu for chain restaurant.  I avoid chains.  This was good though.  I had the black tea gimlet.  It was nice.  You could taste the tea, elderflower, sage, and citrus.  I ate the lamb, the one with the cumin and mint.  The malbec went with it nice.  I like sheep."}
{"text":"Great service, good food. Appetizers were awesome, definitely recommend this place..."}
{"text":"I've seen their food in the frozen food aisle of the grocery store, but I just discovered the actual restaurant earlier this week and have went back twice so far!

Like othersh, I too am perplexed at the low star rating. It's an amazing restaurant with a wonderful atmosphere. The food is high quality and delicious (although the Firecracker Shrimp should be dubbed \"Dynamite\" Shrimp because woo, it's hot! delicious, but hot). The staff is friendly and fast

So far, I've had the Summer Saigon Roll (absolutely delicious and refreshing), Crab Wontons (very good - full of meat, not cream cheese like the typical), and today I had the Firecracker Shrimp which, like I said, is HOT! Even though I ordered take out with a 10 min drive back to work, it was still crispy and delicious when I finally got around to eating it!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We visitied PF Changs on Sunday with a large group of 20 people.  Although they had to split the tables - everything was delicious!

We enjoyed everything from the spring rolls and chicken lettuce wraps...to the mooshu that they made special vegetarian for one of the guests...to the fried banana dessert!

if you are with a group, and you want dessert - get the fried bananas!  They come wrapped in a spring roll wrapper and with coconut/pineapple ice cream.

Overall, we had a great time and would come back here again."}
{"text":"Chinese is my type of food when I eat out. I went to PF changs years ago but never went back, not because of the food, but because it's so dark in there !  I understand they want to make it romantic but really ...does it have to be that dark ? you cannot read the menu for sure and you don't see what you are eating. Chinese food usually is not for a romantic dining like French or Italian dining so I don't understand why it's dark in there like a night club. This is what keep me away !"}
{"text":"Ordered own spin on low mien with scallop & shrimp - Generous portion of both for just $2. Very tasty & well taken care of too!"}
{"text":"I had takeout for lunch and got the Saigon Summer Rolls pairing with Wonton Soup. 

The Wonton soup had minimal flavor. It did have shrimp, water chestnuts, and clumps of chicken in it along with 2 wontons but like I said lacked any actual flavor.

The Summer rolls were better. They serve them cut in half which makes stuff fall out. I'd rather them keep it a solid roll. The chicken inside was too dry for the roll so I picked some of it out. The sauce it came with was good but filllled with sesame seeds. I liked some seeds but ended up scooping forkfuls of seeds out of the sauce. Way too much.

Also the prices are higher for what you're getting. The food looks good but is disappointing.

I'll eat here again (to use the rest of my gift card) then probably won't come back. There are much better options out there and at better prices."}
{"text":"We had dinner here around Christmas.  There were six of us.  PF Chang's did a great job.  The food was incredible.  We shared at least ten different dishes and they were all great.  The fried  string beans were especially memorable.  They have these desserts that come in shot glasses (mousse, key lime, etc.) that were the perfect way to finish our meal.  We've always like PF Changs."}
{"text":"I work in the restaurant industry in the back office operations side.  I am both very sympatheic and understanding of what it takes to run a restauant, retain customers, and how easy it is to lose one; I understand that TIPS can make the day for most. Tonight, party of one, I sat at the bar to enjoy a drink and dinner.  Although I was seated prior to others and acknowledged with water, my drink and food order was taken well after others seated after me.  Although apologetic due to competing demands, my bartender/server did finally take my order and my order was correct; however, I was sitting front and center and could see and hear most interactions.  Of course I sat quietly staring at my phone because it was awkard enough....On this rare occasion, I felt compelled to tip less than the standard & I'm normally way more generous than the standard.  Unfortunately, for this reputable chain, I will seek other options in the future."}
{"text":"good but very over priced for chinese-AMERICAN.  Amercian being the key word."}
{"text":"Place was packed on Saturday evening and the receptionist was quite arrogant because of that. I know when the restaurant is empty, they tend to be much nicer with arriving customers. Meals in general are delicious but we were disappointed with the quality of meat in both the Mongolian Beef and Pepper Steak. Menu says \"tender pieces of steak\" but the meat was as bad as any other cheaper Chinese joints. The Crab Won Ton was a major disappointment with a tiny little cream cheese twisted inside the shell and no taste of crab whatsoever. The so called \" Prawns\" are basically large shrimps. We have had prawns in Louisiana and Australia as well. Two of those will actually make a meal!! Please change the menu to read Jumbo Shrimps. And please remove the description \" Tender\" from your beef meals. Service and ambiance/ decor are quite good."}
{"text":"Great Chinese on a budget.  I prefer the higher end places like Pearl at the MGM, but PF Chang's can always be counted on for a good meal.  In any city, you can count on quality meals here.  The thing that stands out to me about PF Chang's is that they use very high end ingredients for a chain restaurant.  The menu lacks imagination, but the ingredients make up for it."}
{"text":"It may have been cuz we were starving so it felt like forever that we waited for a server to even acknowledge our presence or take our drink order! And it wasn't even thar packed! After 15 minutes of watching servers walk by our table, help the tables around us & continue ignoring us we finally had enough & walked out. Sad cuz I really was looking forward to it!

We went across the street to Bahama Breeze and got Wonderful service....."}
{"text":"Took the family for dinner on a Saturday night without a reservation. Clearly a dozen empty tables in the restaurant, yet we waited 20 minutes for a table. Ordered appetizers, which took longer than I'd have expected, and I wasn't sure the server was going to take an entrée order in a timely manner so I flagged her down to suggest that. Appetizers were perfectly good in quality. When the entrees eventually came out, they were clumsily pushed onto the table. The quality of the entrees was very good, so nice job to the kitchen staff.

Unprompted, the server apologized for the slow service, saying that the kitchen was slow because it was so busy. I read this same statement (verbatim) in another review of this PF Chang location - sounds like a chronic issue here.

I've enjoyed good quality and service at several other PF Chang's locations over the years, but this location doesn't measure up. We won't return."}
{"text":"We went to this location, and it was awful.
-Food was cold.
-Service was terrible.
-Our server even forced me to put my leftovers in a box with my hands.

It was so bad I sent a note to PF Chang's corporate. They followed up with an email, basically saying they were sorry. They even had the store manager call me. You know what he did? He said he was sorry. Are you kidding me? I'd at least expect a GC to come back. Nope. I'll never go back. It's overpriced crap. At least at Pei Wei it's cheaper and you get your food hot.

Here's my letter to corporate: Hello, I'm writing in regard to the dinner we just had at your Happy Valley location. I'm extremely sorry to say it was very disappointing. When we arrived at our table there were used napkins under the table, and the wrapped silverware I was supposed to use was on the seat of the booth. I asked for a different napkin roll (who wants to use a napkin on your face where people have sat?), so the server gave me one from a different table where he placed the one I didn't want. The food was ok. It tasted ok, but it was not very warm at all. I ordered the mu shu chicken, which I asked for the server to wrap in the crepes me. I understand they are not the most simple to wrap, but by the time they got done with them they looked pretty unappetizing. They were ripped and pretty rough looking. I would have told the server or anybody that our food wasn't very hot, but nobody ever came back to the table to ask us how everything was. I also was only drinking water because I'm pregnant and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. It would have been nice to have been offered more water at some point. It's disappointing to me, because we only try to eat out once a week lately to help save money. We thought we'd treat ourselves to a nice afternoon movie and then a nice dinner out. I selected your restaurant because I thought of it as more mid-upper scale. So, I thought it would be a nice treat for my partner and myself. Nobody ever came back to ask how things were. When I asked the server for to-go boxes he suggested I \"take care of it myself.\" Basically, he'd already cleared everything away, so I had to put the mu shu chicken roll in the box myself with my hands. I felt this was sort of weird and inappropriate. I mean, better my hands than his, but it's not what I'd call a nice dining experience. Our server was just ok, but it did seem like we weren't that important to him - but maybe that's how he feels if you don't order drinks and apps - if he's assuming you aren't going to tip him very well. I always tip at least 20%, if not more, when the service is good. He was lucky to get 15%. He was fair at best. I found all of this very surprising because the restaurant was maybe a third full - so it's not like they were so slammed that things slipped by. The other sad thing is that we spent a good part of our dining conversation talking about where we should have gone for better Chinese food and service. Then when we left my partner kept commenting on how Applebee's, Logan's or Ah-So would have been better. Perhaps it would have. I noticed on my receipt a message saying I could take a survey if I had a code. I had no code or I would have gladly taken the survey with this feedback. I also noticed the staff trying to seat a couple at a booth where two young children had previously been. The booth was messy and had food on the seat, and the older gentleman had to point it out to the server asking her to clean it before he sat down. There were plenty of open tables, yet she was sitting them next to the kitchen at a dirty table. In fact, she was wiping the table as she sat them down - in a restaurant that was a third full! I hope your staff is able to correct some of this obvious issues. During what continues to be tough economic times, I think people are much more selective about their dining-out dollars. I know that's our case. I would be very hesitant to return to any of your locations after this dinner."}
{"text":"The Banana Rolls for dessert were great! The food was okay. I was expecting more. The main course meals didn't have much taste or flavor, in my opinion. What blew me away was the customer service!! Our server was amazing. All the staff was friendly and polite. Thank you guys for that!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant, good food, good service, except.... when we asked the waitress for to go boxes. She said she only had big boxes so we were going to put 2 items in one box. When she can back with small boxes we were confused. She then proceeded to grab all the plates and start to dump them into boxes. While she was moving boxes around, she put 3 dishes in one. My broccoli and beef is now under my sister's mongolian beef, which is now under everyone's rice. Just guessing, but that's one way to ruin everyone's food. Yet the experience started from when I walked in. The host wish me happy birthday, great. The waitress on the other hand did not offer anything to drink besides basics. I just turned 21. Apparently I'm still not allowed to order alcohol, but my TWIN sister can, as she was the only one offered that menu."}
{"text":"I know it's considered lame to write about chain restaurants on here...but I digress.

I really enjoyed eating here. The only thing that wasn't good was the Moo Goo Gai Pan, but I've never cared for that anyway. Everything was fresh tasting, the restaurant was clean, and the waitstaff was friendly. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Every time falling in love with this restaurant and food. Everything so good over here. Best for any occasion. My best food here is Dynamite Shrimp and Spicy Eggplant with brown rice. Vegetable spring roll is so good here. Love love love ..."}
{"text":"This is by FAR my fav. PF Chang's location.  The dining room and bar are a different  lay out than the others.  Way more space in between tables, and better sound deadening materials.  You can actually have a conversation in here when it's crowded. 

The Happy Hour is amazing here $3 and $ dollar food items and great happy hour drinks.  They feature wine beer and mixed drinks , so everybody will be able to find something here. 

On this particular night Jerry was at the bar serving us and he was GREAT.  Never lets your ice tea , water or whatever be empty.  There were 3 of us eating and it was steamed pork dumplings all around.  OMG they are literally the best dumplings in town.  I keep ordering them other places, but they just cant hold a candle to these at PF Chang's.  We also had Orange Peel Chicken and Crispy Green Beans. Everything was excellent and the service was impeccable. 

I'm never disappointed here , food, service and great regulars.  If you are in the north valley and just need a bite or need to wait out the traffic or whatever its a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"I am embarrassed to admit that this is the restaurant we go to the most. Reason 1) it is super consistent and we like that 
Reason 2) we live in the middle of nowhere and this is close to the aforementioned middle of nowhere. 
Reason 3) it is vaguely close to chinese food. 
Reason 4) my husband tolerates it. 
Reason 5) i can drink tea and eat lettuce wraps minus the rice sticks and not totally trash the diet.

Now the goods...they have great service....sometimes too good...within 2 minutes of receiving our food we had been checked on by the server, the manager, and they guy filing our glasses. We weren't actually sure we could finish dinner we were nodding and smiling so much. The happy valley location seems empty compared to arrowhead so we prefer it. They are constantly filling your drinks. All in all they are a well choreographed chainrest. With zero soul but solid performance that will hold us out until our inevitable move into a more central area of phoenix."}
{"text":"Let me try to be brief..Stay Away from this pf changs including their rude floor manager Jonny that was just an ass or very ignorant!!..Greasy plates,greasy utensils and i guess our waitress kyleigh eat half of my main course that  i asked to be packed togo because my togo food came back in a lil box which i didn't realize til i got home!!Food Great , Kyleigh gave great service but my food probably didn't fit in the box so she threw it out or eat it LoL!!! True Story...You'll regret not listening if you decide to dine here!!.."}
{"text":"Happy hour was awesome from 3-6. The chicken lettuce raps were amazing. Next time I will just get two order of these for us. Our drinks were bomb. They pear mojito was delicious. Go for happy hour. Nice to have in the hotel."}
{"text":"This place is a must lots of food great prices my wife and I really enjoyed ourselves Jessica was our server she was wonderful"}
{"text":"Eh, this place is okay. It's decent for a big chain, and the prices are fairly good. We both got a slightly sick stomach after eating here, and we believe it's from the food being too oily. We would return for convenience or if friends are going there, but we wouldn't go on our own."}
{"text":"The genius behind PF Changs is how they managed to convince people to pay an arm and a leg for what is essentially a glorified Panda Express Menu. I only gave them a star because of their service and decor, which is very good.

As far as the food goes, it is fake ass, watered down, gentrified, \"Americanized\" faux Chinese food and BORING in every sense of the word. All I could think of when the plates of bland and overpriced, tasteless plates of beef, pork, or whatever the hell it was I ordered was how uninspiring the food in this restaurant was.

tl;dr: Don't eat at PF Changs, there are dozens of other Chinese restaurants in Vegas that are miles better than this place."}
{"text":"I've been a fairly big PF Chang's fan for the better part of 10 years now.  I really do like their food quite a bit - it satisfies my cravings for Chinese without being one of those hole-in-the-wall, questionable ingredients, over greasy takeout type places.

Tonight, though, the service was fairly disappointing.

We had a party of four (two couples) and we both ordered Chang's for Two.  The lettuce wraps came and were very good, but we only got two or three decent lettuce cups out of the heads of lettuce we were given.  

Our soups came, and one of our party did not receive a spoon.  She asked for one, and was promised it, but it never arrived.  She ended up using her boyfriend's after he finished his soup.

Our drinks ran dry around the 10 minute mark.  Our server was nowhere to be seen.  When she arrived with our entrees, we asked for refills.  Nothing.  It got to the point where we stopped eating because we were so thirsty, but nothing came.  Our server walked by several times without even looking at us.  We didn't get refills until one of our party asked to speak with a manager, about 25 minutes after they were empty.

I requested brown rice with my entree and was given white.  I didn't bother to have that error corrected because I didn't want any more delays.  We waited another 10 minutes after we were finished eating (and confirmed such to our waitress) for to-go boxes and yet another 10 after that for dessert.  Portions of our meals were comped, which was a nice touch.

I've had much better service here, but it has gone downhill lately.  Get your shiz together, PFC.  I like you too much for this."}
{"text":"Me and my family came into the restaurant and asked if we can sit at a booth. The receptionist had said all booths were full and we would have to wait for them. Already a good start.

A few minutes later, a booth had apparently opened. A reddish-brown haired Asian woman had took us to a table, not a booth. We informed her that we asked for a booth. She didn't bother to ask any other employees if there were any booths, she just looked around and said there weren't any. Look out for her. Something that lead to my dismay was that a family that came in after us ended getting a booth and were served first. 

Our actual waitress was very nice though, one of the only good things about our experience. We had ordered our food and waited a whopping 40 minutes. That wasn't pretty either. I guess it was worth it, cause the food was pretty good. I recommend the \"Chang's Shrimp and Lobster Fried Rice,\" it's spicy and has two choices of seafood in one. 

When we were finished, the bill was a fair price, another good thing. So my overall experience of this was the restaurant's food and its price was pretty good, but those things had failed to make up for the service. Maybe not going to this location anytime soon.

TL;DR: This restaurant has very delicious food along with a very good price. However, its service was definitely not good. Be cautious when going here."}
{"text":"This review is more about the location than it is the food.  As with any restaurant, there are good servers and bad servers.  It seems this particular location has more good ones than bad.  We have several ones we regularly ask for who are absolutely
the bomb.

We've been to this particular joint about 15 times and the food has always been good.  Not great, but good enough.  Sitting on the patio is really what makes this place a blast on a weekend.  The people watching while having a few drinks is fun.  You have the beautiful (at least on the outside) Citycenter towering over PH.  The sidewalk going by the patio is ground zero for a lot of crazy activity, and you're pretty much guaranteed to see something interesting during dinner on a Saturday night.

The waits are usually pretty bad during the evenings, a phone-ahead reservation really helps."}
{"text":"Worst chinese food i ever had! Overpriced bland food! Unfriendly service! Left very disappointed and agreed to never come back!"}
{"text":"Something is very weird about this location.  I have been going here on and off for the past three years but over the last 6 months or so it has steadily gone down hill.

The food is still great, I'll give them that.  Not consistent in terms of spiciness but I actually take that as a good sign that my food is being prepared fresh and not just from a pre-made bag of prepared food.

The main problem I have is the management here.   Service has always been good but the managers seem to get a kick out of berating and harassing the servers which ruins  the meal for me.  The manager would stand next to our server and tell her that we needed drink refills.  This was about 5 seconds after she said \"I'll be right back with some refills.\"

Later when she came by she asked if she could put our leftovers in some take home containers... seconds later the manager yelled at her to get us some to-go containers. Creepy and harassing and not the first time I have seen it.  A table next to us joked \"what's with the bouncer?\" Just not a relaxing atmosphere to enjoy your food anymore. Please send your managers to a restaurant etiquette class!"}
{"text":"My kids and I loved the food here perfect if you're looking for something different to eat. My daughter loved the Lo Mein pasta and is excited to go back! They have so many options and the wait isn't bad so we recommend it to anyone who likes Asian Fusion food!"}
{"text":"The best thing on the menu (so far as I know) is the Dynamite Shrimp appetizer. I could eat it every day. That sauce is so amazing, and the shrimp is delicious. I also like their Chang's Spicy Chicken. Their Lo Mein is also very good, and the fried rice is tasty and worth the small upcharge. Get on their rewards program to earn a free entree - very worthwhile."}
{"text":"Second time been in but there is a lot to say all about service and food, big wooohooo wowwwww  for sure. Both of us and my daughter  spend 150$ at PF Chang, it alot isn't it ? It's worth to a penny service impeccable and food hight end Chinese with American palate but nothing wrong  with it. Soo yummy with delicious spices, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and wine to port, orchata  dessert are amazed us. Chilean sea bass, lobster taco, spare rib five spices, malbec Argentina was on point, my daughter was so happy with their dessert  as well, she is a foodie, very picky eater. over all its great for healthy  Chinese food and wine selection.  We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Too expensive, kind of plan, not enough portion for the price and not authentic asian food! 

The only thing I like about PF Chang is their drink menus. Otherwise service kind of sucks and so does the food. They are super busy also; so be prepare to wait to eat overly price food. 

I heard the PF Chang is a lot better in the South Park area, but having the experience I did at this PF Chang I don't think I want to waste my time again."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience three weeks ago in this restaurant. When I called the manager, she apologized and insisted that the waitress in question would receive more training. Upon our return last weekend (Hey, I can't help it...I love the food), the manager came by to make sure everything was okay at least 4 times during the meal. It was completely unexpected, but she gave us a discount on our meal, and offered us free dessert. I was simply happy with the apology, but Maria went out of her way to make sure that we had a good dining experience that night. (For the record, we had our usual fantastic service from our waiter). Great people. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Everything has the most amazing flavors. Just as good as ant other that I have been to. Don't know why their rating isn't higher. Prices are not ridiculous like in casinos. Twice the food for 1/2 the cost"}
{"text":"While there were no insect carcasses in my food, I was still not very impressed with my meal at PF Chang's.  I went for a \"business lunch\" with my boss.  Who thought I would ever enjoy working more than eating??--I think this meal was a first!

I got steamed veggies and brown rice.  Now I expected it to be pretty bland, since it mentioned no sauces added at all.  But the vegetables were rubbery, not crisp like they should be after a good steaming. The rice was pretty underdone as well, so all-in-all, they got nothing right.  I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit, but it was too little, too late.

Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup.  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick, but this needed much more help than a little pepper.  It was very bland, and didn't taste like anything.  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating.  And, of course, there was no salt and pepper on the table, so I couldn't even enjoy it the way I like. 

Because I didn't pay, I didn't complain to the waiter, but normally this would not have passed by me.  Though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable, I still would not return here if given the choice."}
{"text":"The frozen p.f changs taste better than this! We got the four course for two. To start the soup smelled like cat urine and was not even edible. The calamari appetizer was simply ok. (not cooked very well at all) The chicken was fatty and tasted rather old. The dessert (great wall of chocolate) was actually pretty good minus the raspberry sauce. The atmosphere is pretty cool and super nice however the food is definitely not up to par. The service wasn't very good either.  I will never waste another $70 on this place. I'd rather go to a restaurant that's worth spending that. A Chinese buffet would have been the better option and definitely a lot cheaper!"}
{"text":"Every now and then you get service that is so good it makes the dining experience,  tonight we had that experience.  All credit goes to Daisy. She was amazing the entire time. Someone needs to give her a promotion!"}
{"text":"Worst hostess in the world. So rude! Inappropriate....no class. All the other staff is great but you might want to reconsider the rude front line. It's not the first time this has happened to me or friends of mine."}
{"text":"Great chinese food is hard to find... so hard to find, in fact, that most people have never even tasted it.   In the US you can find it in San Francisco, New York, and Boston...  but that's it.   

The rest of the country will never know GREAT chinese food, but they may be lucky enough to find good chinese food.   The vast majority of Americans will only ever get OKAY chinese food.

P.F. Chang's is better than OKAY and  just shy of being GOOD chinese food, which is why so many people who don't know what good chinese food is get so excited about this place.

P.F. Chang's is basically just a a couple steps up from the Panda Express at your local food court... except it's a lot more expensive.  

The ONLY thing that stops me from giving P.F. Chang's a lower rating is that they actually make a really fantastic hot and sour soup- which is an incredibly hard thing to find.

The hot and sour soup is always salty- sometimes too salty... but when they do it just right, it's very delicious.   

*In case you're wondering, there is good chinese food in charlotte... or at least something very close to it.   Look for a little place called Wan-Fu at 10719 Kettering Drive."}
{"text":"Always Good and I love the new fresh look. Service friendly and efficient. Don't know what else one needs. Prices have gone up but so has everything."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time for dinner.  Christopher the bartender made us wonderful sangria and Chaz our server was attentive and very professional.

We had a great time,  the atmosphere was lovely. Sat outside in the lovely evening air.

We had the sea bass which was cooked to perfection and crab rangoon which was equally well prepared and tasty.

Highly recommend PF Changs to all Scottsdale visitors."}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for itself is the decor. The food is very Americanized and not true at all of what real Chinese good should look or taste like, and the host/hostess think their doing us a favor by seating us."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and sat at the bar. Bartender was no where to be found. When he did come out it was with no greeting at all. We felt like an inconvenience because we wanted to order food. Dont plan on getting in and out for lunch. While sitting there a young female server came up to him complaining  about a customer at her table. That wanted his rice warm and that she was over him and gave him to another server. It would be nice if the staff appeciated the customer a bit more. We can choose another restaurant the next time and we probably will. Food to go may be a better opion for this location."}
{"text":"I came to eat with my family tonight and decided to order an alcoholic beverage, one of my family memebers took a drink and moments later the manager \"mara anderson\" came very rudely to intterupt and yell that we were in vegas and we had to have an identification, i am aware of our wrongs but there are different ways to talk to costumers and be more proffesional!! She made the whole restuarant well aware of everything, and the usuage of her vocabulary was completly humilating!"}
{"text":"Very good customer service, very intimate, the staff are very friendly and hospitable, and the food came out on a good timely manner.  I noticed they are very clean and fast paced and they come and check on you frequently which I liked the atmosphere is very nice and trendy and people are not loud.  If you like a nice quiet dinner this is the place to go.  I came on a Wednesday with my partner at 8:30pm"}
{"text":"This was the worst and only bad experience that I've ever had at P.F. Chang's. After browsing the menu, my friend and I discovered that it would be advantageous for us to order the P.F. Chang's For Two, because it included everything that we wanted to order and would be cheaper than ordering everything separately. Our server interrupted me while ordering and stated that it was too much food for us (unaware that we were going to order that much food anyway) and tried to discourage us from ordering that. The entrées come with white or brown rice, but we asked if we could pay an upcharge to get fried rice, which has never been a problem at other locations. Initially, our server said that we could do that, but then later said that we'd have to order an entire side or entrée of fried rice. Maybe this is the restaurant's policy, so no fault to the server there, but it is a terrible policy and they should rethink that. We settled for brown rice, but we were given white rice because they were supposedly out of brown rice. Number one, you don't give someone something that they didn't order just because you ran out and assume that they'll be okay with it. Number two, this would have been a good opportunity to offer us fried rice as a substitute since that's what we really wanted. We also asked for extra crispy noodles for our soup. The soup comes out with no crispy noodles at all, so we had to ask for those. In the meantime our soup gets cold. Drink refills were slow. Both of our drinks emptied several times. Often he walked past our table with a pitcher of water, but didn't stop to refill our glasses. One time he refilled my glass, but not my friend's glass, even though they were both empty. The only positive thing that I can say is that he is honest, because I had more money on my gift card than I thought I did, and he returned the unnecessary cash that I gave him. I will not be recommending P.F. Chang's to any of my friends that are visiting the Las Vegas Strip. The only reason that I'm giving three stars is because the appetizer (chicken lettuce wraps) and entrées (crispy honey chicken and Mongolian beef) were delicious. The other two stars would've been awarded if we had good service."}
{"text":"Overall, i like the food and atmosphere. service is good. The almond chicken dish is delicious.  My main complaint is that they, for an unknown reason,  serve the Merlot chilled,  which is what my girlfriend drinks only.  When we got the drink, even the waiter said that other customers complained the Merlot was chilled.  He said the manager did this. He offered to microwave the merlot for us! 

I had mentioned going their for dinner the other night, and my girlfriend declined based on the chilled Merlot.  

So if you, Mr. Manager, read this, chill out and stop chilling the Merlot. Room Temperature is fine and what everyone else serves it at. 

This may not seem like a big deal but it is for my girlfriend and now I can't enjoy their food.  :(

She lives in Henderson."}
{"text":"The service and wait staff are good. Food was delivered to the table hot. I had the Singapore Noodles and the dish was okay, but not what I was expecting.  I had the dish at Thai restaurants and its usually a curry based dish, but here at PF Changs it tastes more vinegar based.  It wasn't bad, but I was wantinf curry."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner for the family.  Great Gluten Free section of menu, and they knew how to handle the food correctly to prevent cross contamination. 

Just do it!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the fact that it says they're open til 11pm, drive all the way here, on the door it says 11pm on Fri and Sat only. Sun-Thurs 10pm! Very annoying"}
{"text":"This dining experience was one of the best I have ever had! Our waiter was extremely helpful and friendly, and he made us laugh more than a few times. Along with the service, the food was great. Unfortunately, one item that our group had ordered was taking a while to come out from the kitchen. The staff was very friendly, and our waiter and the manager apologized for it countless times. They came over to make sure we were still doing alright and to make sure we weren't angry. Overall, I have no complaints about this experience and cannot wait to go back. The manager took the item off of our bill and upgraded the dish to a more expensive item. 10 out of 10. Will return."}
{"text":"Our family really loves PF Changs.  In fact, our 11-year-old wanted her birthday meal with the family here.  We really enjoy the happy hour specials, 3p-6p.  We get a little bit of everything off the appetizer menu that feeds a family of four perfectly."}
{"text":"I'm a big foodie and love eating out.  This is one of my favorite places.  Great food, welcoming staff, managers remember me as I eat here on average once a week.  I also think they're starting to scrimp on quality, though.  Last time I had Mongolian Beef, the meat was tough and chewy, not cooked to perfection as it used to be.  My rice was also crunchy, but they fixed that when I brought it to the waiter's attention.  I guess it's a sign of the times and cost-cutting for restaurants to cut corners, but I never thought PF Chang's would do that.  Overall, I still love the place!  I'm a Warrior!"}
{"text":"Portions are more than other places that I've been too. Mongolian beef is consistent. If you show them Westin key card, you get a free chicken lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"Honestly this location makes the best food! They really put the extra effort in making it taste amazing. I highly recommend it. My favorites here were the fried rice, chicken soup, and dynamite shrimp. Also, not going to lie their portions were huge, and such a good deal for the price. I love P.F. Chang's but this is by far my favorite location."}

Service: 4 stars (our waitress was very attentive) 
Ambiance: 3 stars (casual setting, a bit noisy)
Cleanliness:  3 stars (appeared to be clean and well kept)
Food: 1 star (factory food, bland, all tasted the same, soggy shrimp) 
Price: 2 stars (while not the cheapest the prices are mid-range)"}
{"text":"Anyone who criticizes this place for not being healthy or REAL Chinese food...DUH (thank you Captain Obvious!) That's like downgrading Coldstone for not being homemade or healthy ice cream!  To each their own I guess but I've never come here to feel like I was in China or eating clean, healthy food.

Now, to the service...I have NEVER had a bad experience here with service.  The staff is extremely friendly and nice.  They ate attentive (never have my ice tea empty, etc). 

This place is great!  The food is awesome! The decor is nice!  The staff is friendly and attentive.  

I come here three to four times and a month and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Great place to go. Great happy hour prices too. Can't go wrong with the lettuce wraps. They give you some sauces on the side to help you concoct the perfect flavor. I also really enjoyed the banana tempura for desert, the ice cream really topped it off. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Came for lunch and ordered Ginger chicken with Broccoli which had only 3 pieces of broccoli with brown tips, some very bland chicken, and over half the plate was steamed rice.  Ordered a side app of egg drop soup that was lukewarm but Ok taste.  All above for $12.95!!!  Stick to a privately owned, smaller Asian restaurant that wants to do a good job."}
{"text":"decided to come here for dinner with the boo! we got the dinner for two special. initially service was fantastic but after that, it was downhills from there. no one once checked back on us and everything was super salty! I feel like the roof of my mouth is raw from all the salt! the lettuce wraps were salty, the ribs were salty, the cup of hot and sour soup was a bowel of salt. on top of that, my water cup has been emptied since I arrived. I understand that it's busy, but it would be nice for them to notice a bit. I love the lettuce wraps but will never return. I got up and grabbed to go boxes myself to to go our food. I'm still waiting for our dessert. it's been about thirty minutes!"}
{"text":"I went with my family late at night ,the food was not good at all , it looked like the left over , I hate it.
The service was not that professional!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a conference in June and just happened I had some PF Chang gift cards (two adding up to $35 worth) that have been in my wallet for some time.  My friends and I walked over to PF Changs from MGM Grand - Very walkable distance and great spot on The Strip.  We had to wait for 20 minutes for our table, but we were given one of those vibrating, light-flashing coasters to let us know when our table was ready, so we went outside to wait and people watch until our table was ready.  Awesome dry desert heat, interesting people, and view.

We got a great booth and the service was awesome.  I asked if I could apply both gift cards to our total bill and he said of course I could. Win! :) The meals were reasonably priced and took about 15-20 minutes to get to our table.  We all ordered something different and I was hankering for some noodles.  Not sure what I ordered but I think it was deep friend noodles that were then stir fried.  What was I thinking...Anyway, the sauce was thick and the meal sat heavy in my tummy.  The food wasn't super duper in my book, but then I've only had one dish there so far.  Nothing super spectacular about the food that we ordered but we loved the restaurant, location, and service.  You can't beat that!  Oops, wait.  My friend ordered a shrimp dish that was actually fresh and delicious looking.  I will definitely go to PF Changs again to give it another try and we have one here in Seattle.  Next time I will try something less fried.  It's definitely worth checking out if you are in Vegas for the experience, price, and decent menu.  I did love the iced tea, though. Very refreshing. :)"}
{"text":"Try the lobster fried rice, yummy,  Lettuce wraps always delish.  Always adding new items, they are wonderful"}
{"text":"I had nothing but great service... food is excellent and now with the light rail I can actually enjoy a ride to Tempe, without the long ride there.  The best is the lettuce wraps, and to be honest with you, after I eat that, I don't even have to have dinner, just drinks..."}
{"text":"Wow..what a experience my brother and sister in law took me to p.f.changs in charlotte we drove 2 hours to eat the food was good the server was unprofessional and  ignored us that is ridiculous"}
{"text":"P F Chang's is one of my favorite restaurants, great variety of food, great mix of tastes, all at a good price.  Our trip this Wednesday was disappointing though.

Yes, there was a wait but it was within the 20-25 minutes we were told when we arrived.  However, there always seemed to be 6 or 7 empty tables.  My favorite is the ribs, which are an appetizer.  My wife and I decided to order 4 different appetizers (ribs, lettuce wraps, rice, and dumplings) instead of meals.  We asked for all 4 to be delivered at same time, which our server said yes to.  Our drinks were delivered quickly, but incorrect.  Our food took 20-25 minutes, and came out piecemeal.  A person delivered the rice and lettuce wraps, but we had to ask about our other dishes.  Waitress told us they would come out soon, but it took another 15 minutes.

We were told that 2 employees had quit that night and that a manager had to leave the restaurant to get silverware, they had run out.  Strange.  While I understand people quitting, we also observed 2 employees at a work station 
near us and they were not that busy.

Hope this is a one-off."}
{"text":"PF Changs has always been a place where I have enjoyed going for some Chinese food and the food was still excellent. I had the hot and sour soup to start which was a nice start, chicken lettuce wraps were delicious, the crispy honey chicken was cooked very well and the banana spring rolls for dessert has become one of my favors dishes. The reason for the two star review is because of the service which was horrible. It took us about and hour and a half to complete our meal and this is because the waiter that attended to our table to put it lightly couldn't have cared any less about pretending to want to be there. If we wanted a drink we had to wait, every dish took forever to come out and it being a thurs night with a very limited amount of patrons it didn't seem to make sense what was taking so long. The restaurant used to be a nice place for a night out,  a date something of that sort, but it's completely lost its gusto. I would compare it to a little bit nicer than Chilis when before I held PF Changs to a higher standard. I guess the more corporate you become, the less you care about what takes place in your restaurant and it clearly shows"}
{"text":"Made reservations for a large party and they were very accommodating .  However appetizers took nearly an hour to arrive at the table.  And it was literally 90 min before main course arrived at the table.  Not everyone's meal showed up at the same time and when the rest of the leaks arrived they were cold, which means all the meals could have been all brought out together.    Our server did make recommendations on new menu items that were tasty."}
{"text":"Service was terrible! We had to ask for a server after a 10 minute wait. That was after being seated. Didn't have the dish I wanted, either. This is the worst experience I've ever had here. I come here fairly often,  but never again!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! We are there at least twice a month and have never had a bad time. Kudos to the staff for knowing how to treat your customers!"}
{"text":"Great gluten free menu

My husband and I eat here often because I'm gluten free and this is my only safe choice for gluten free Chinese food, but also because we're addicted to the Singapore Street Noodles. My non gluten free hubby loves the gluten free version more than the regular version. PF Changs uses different plates for gluten free dishes, they are round and have PF Changs China Bistro printed on them, this is to guarantee that gluten free orders are in fact delivered to the right people. I appreciate the extra step big time!

We always get a bowl of egg drop soup to share, my husband orders the Northern Style Ribs (not gf because they are marinated in regular soy sauce although they offer a gluten free version of the soy sauce they don't do the ribs that way), then we get the Singapore Street Noodles and Combo (chicken and pork) gluten free fried rice. Service is always good at this location and for the last 4 years we've almost always had the same server if we go in at dinner time. We always do call ahead for seating, unless you go in at lunch I strongly recommend it. 

Food is great, now I'm craving it again... Stupid appetizing review."}
{"text":"Love PF Chang's but service at this location is inconsistent. Worse service and behavior by staff I have ever had... Waited nearly 15 minutes to even be acknowledged by server. Wow!"}
{"text":"Best service in the world... I ordered my soup and 3 minutes there it was. Me and my family went because we were traveling and it was very close to are hotel. And the waiter was amazing... He was busy but kept our drinks full and cleaned up plates fast and since it was July 4 we asked if he knew any firework shows around and he told us the closest place... Food was amazing and since I have braces I got egg drop soup and chicken fried rice and I'm glad I did it was amazing and didn't have to wait long at all... Will be going to more P.F Changs soon!"}
{"text":"Pumpkin wontons are delicious!! Organic agave margaritas and Mongolian beef never disappoint. The managers Christi and victor stopped by and really made us feel like royalty! We will be back time and time again. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Good choice as expected. The menu has been shrunk, so some options and choices are gone.

The healthier, Quinoa, choice is gone, so just rice.

Ordered the good ol standby, orange chicken, and was disappointed. The real oranges are a nice touch, but unfortunately the sauce had seeds in it. They need to strain them out.

Otherwise up to the PF Changs standard!"}
{"text":"used to be such a great restaurant. really gone downhill. had a server that took our drink order and then never came back to the table. finally ordered from someone else and got raw chicken skewers and a noodle dish with- NO LIE- more stalks of green onion/scallion than noodles, CILANTRO and TOMATOES in an Asian noodle dish. very weird food on a new \"farm to table\" menu. all this and when leaving, told the manager and he didnt care or apologize. no thanks."}
{"text":"I always have a good meal here.  Lunch today with a coworker was perfect.  

We enjoy the Lunch Specials on the back of the menu- today I went with Spicy Chang, white rice, and egg drop soup for me.  The egg drop soup was very good today!  All the items are cooked to order, delivered hot, and full of flavor.  

This location is a skip around the corner from UNLV where we work.  It's a nice little lunch spot and is never too crowded.  The service is always good, our drinks get refilled more than enough, and we are in and out in less than an hour.  

 I don't really care that it's a chain restaurant.  If they consistently deliver good food and good service, it's a great place for me!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go to this location and enjoy and evening out, so we went during happy hour and sat in the bar area. all we were looking for was a nice night out, in which it did not happen? we sat at one of the long tables in the bar waited for ever to even be taken care of? once we were finally waited on our drink's took for ever? we ordered our food took some time? Then I guess the regular's started coming in, one guy just sat right next to me and said how long will you be? I usually always have this table and I have other people coming REALLY? Told him I guess WHENEVER we get our food and are finished. The grew at this location apparently felt that this person and his guest's were more valuable than myself and wife??? was asked you may what to go into the dining room????? Well never go back to this location!!!! The regulars may pay your overhead but the rest of us pay your profit. GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The appetizers are great! Not a big fan of the main course..just love the dynamite shrimp..it's phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"It was by accident that we found PF Chang's in Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino. Our friend who was visiting from LA was supposed to meet her friend at the Palazzo. But, after hours of: a) traffic, b) looking for parking, and c) walking aimlessly around City Center, we were all too exhausted to drive to Palazzo! We ended up stopping by PH to get a quick drink, when my friend saw that there was a PF Chang's. She called her friend and made reservations at PF Chang's instead. It was a good decision!

I love PF Chang's! No matter what you order, the quality of the food is excellent. What I also love is that they offer you brown rice instead of white rice.... I've never been disappointed. The 6 of us decided to order a variety of food - one poultry, one pork, one seafood, a salad and a noodle entree. YUM YUM for my tum tum! I was in heaven. My fav was the moo-shu and seafood entree.

I would have given five stars had the wait been less than 2 hours. Mind you, we went there on New Year's day and on a Friday...Regardless, we all had a wonderful time! The waiter was very friendly, helpful and attentive. The wait for the food was not long at all.

Delicious food. Great service. Good times with friends. Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"The 2 stars are for convenient to our hotel. We've eaten in several Chang's around the country and have always found consistently good ambiance, service and food. This won failed at all three. Loud rock music and glaring light from the huge windows showing a not very nice outdoors view was not the usual PF Chang's ambiance. The waiter must have been trained at McDonalds. He did not bring the sauce tray to the table until we asked another waiter. He rushed us through everything, taking the appetizer tray away before we had finished it. When he brought the bill, he stood at the table waiting for us to put the card/cash in the folder. I told him to go away and he looked at me with a glare. The four of us had two different noodle dishes, but the sauce in each was exactly the same and way too much of it. One of our party spent an hour in the bathroom a little later. But, as I said, our hotel was just up the street so it was a quick walk. Bad experience."}
{"text":"Had quite a few gluten free options.  Food was fantastic.  Service was personal and friend but slow.  Went twice this week on vacation and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The service was lackluster. Coffee was warm but delicious. Limited to one cup, apparently, as the waitress never offered a second.

Daughter had sweet and sour shrimp. Wife had spicy chicken. I had wonton soup. Dumplings as an appetizer for the table. All arrived warm. The brown rice was dry as sand and the white rice was delayed by rice cooker problems. Also dry as sand. I guess that is how they serve it.

The base flavors for the shrimp and chicken were nearly identical. I had expected them to be more diverse. 

In all, expectations were not met for what is advertised as upscale. I'd rather have the local Chinese cuisine which more flavorful, and much less expensive."}
{"text":"Long waits at this location. Especially early in the evenings. Staff is very friendly and a manager comp some drinks for us. Food is good."}

{"text":"GREAT SERVICE AND FOOD HERE!

My friend and I ate here on Wednesday, May 30th, and arrived just before 7pm. There weren't many other patrons in the dining area when we got there and even less when we left. We'd been to P.F. Chang's before, but this was the first time at this location (Goodyear on McDowell Rd). We wanted a booth but had to wait for it to be wiped down before we could be seated, which took no time at all. We sat and our waitress came and we got our drinks (both of us ordered water with no lemon). My friend then ordered pan-fried pork dumplings as a starter, and (after some discussing with the waitress about which entree to order) mongolian beef as the entree. I ordered steamed pork dumplings as the entree instead of a starter. A different server returned with our meals and mine was incorrect (pan-fried instead of steamed dumplings), so the server apologized and later returned with the correct order. In the meantime, my friend waited for me to get my food, so the original waitress brought a fresh bowl of rice for him since his had gotten cold. Also, the manager came to our table, apologized for the mix-up with my order and offered both of us free dessert! We both enjoyed our starters and entrees and when we finished, we ordered the Great Wall of Chocolate for dessert. It was served in a small narrow glass and tasted sweet but had a lot of different flavors mixed in, with several layers  of chocolate cake and a raspberry sauce. I was full so I couldn't finish it all, but my friend did! Overall, this was a pleasant dining experience, and the manager and wait staff were very attentive and nice. I'd recommend this P.F. Chang's to anyone and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and Great food! had exceptional service and EVERYONE working at the restaurant last night was very courteous friendly and eager to help! Great experience at one of our favorite places to eat! Consistently good service there one of our best places to eat!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious! I had the same server a few weeks apart and she remembered me and what I had ordered. Wish I could have remembered her name because she was the best server I have ever had. The service is always good and their menu has a wide selection of things. Never a disappointing choice to eat here."}
{"text":"We took our visiting granddaughters for an early dinner and were seated immediately.  Our server was very friendly and when she learned our granddaughters were from out of town took the time to explain the options offered.  We ordered Won Tons, Lettuce wraps and Egg Rolls for starters which was a perfect combination to start with..  A couple of Noodle dishes, one with chicken and the other with pork, Sweet and Sour Pork and Cashew Chicken was more than enough for us to pass and share, in fact could have gotten by just fine with one less noodle dish!  Sweet and Sour was great, not swimming in that dreadful red corn starch thickened sauce!  Our teas and sodas came with refills.  We know that there are many good or even great Chinese restaurants in Phoenix but return to this brand very often for the ambience and gracious servers!"}
{"text":"I went to PF Chang's for the first time with my family. It was a my brother early birthday gift to my mom. We went to the one located near Northlake Mall. There a giant horse in front of the restaurant. My brother made reservations luckily because that place was pack. I normally don't do Chinese cuisines  but I decided to give this food a try. For a appetizer at the request of my sister in law we had lettuce wrap and it was really. The atmosphere was really good and waiter was really helpful and courteous. I order the short ribs with pineapple rice which by the way came on time alone with everyone else food. It was so good and I also tasted the some of the food my family . Everyone had a taste for different things on menu. I got a sweet tea with my meal and yes it was sweet. I was full and had to get a take out box. My mom got dessert in a shot glass. The waiter brought out a tray with all the different variety of desserts and my mom decided to get the apple pie in a glass. She love it."}
{"text":"First off let me say that I am a very experienced Chinese food eater who most often eats at the few authentic places in the Valley. I've also eaten in Hong Kong many times as well. PF Chang's is not even as good as Panda Express. If your criteria for eating is the ambiance its fine. My criteria is the food. The blandest most boring incorrectly prepared Chinese food I have ever eaten. Great service accompanies the bland food so that is a plus and the only reason I have given this place 2 stars."}
{"text":"I'm not really the biggest fan of asian cuisine to begin with but this food is just ok. It's supposed to be a healthy alternative to fast food but after checking the nutritional reviews you can't help but notice the gratuitous amount of sodium. Their food, in my opinion, tastes like a slightly better tasting healthy choice. The service and atmosphere however was on point. They kept the drinks coming. As soon as I finished one another was on the way. They were very friendly as well. They accommodated me in every way possible, sometimes i'm a lil difficult so i commend them. Overall, if you like to go to a place with great service and mediocre food, PF Changs is the place for you. Hope you found this helpful."}
{"text":"I enjoy their Lettuce Wraps! Very delicious. I love it. :)"}
{"text":"Spent Valentine's day dinner with my GF today.  They were not overbooked and seated us at the reservation time. Plenty of waiters but the food came out slow.  But obviously it's date night. So not a problem.  We started with the lettuce wraps.  Always good and always wort two or more leaves of lettuce. Waitress was very hurried but service was good and I left her a good sized tip. Main courses here have shrunk a bit over time. But still plenty in each portion."}
{"text":"went here with a group of 4, we ordered the lettuce wraps (yummm!!) but watch out for the spicy mustard, it's pretty hot. plus we each ordered our own entree. big mistake, there was soo much food leftover we would've been fine ordering just 2-3. (they serve each entree on a serving plate and everyone can eat from it) overall a good place to go as long as it's not too busy."}
{"text":"Once you go Pei Wei, you never go.... PF Chang's (if you can help it). 

Pei Wei is Chang's super convenient and cost friendly fast casual eatery that started infiltrating the Detroit market in 2007. Subsequently, that was the last time I stepped into a PF Changs until I recently moved back to Pittsburgh. Going from a Pei Wei to a PF Chang's is like watching paint dry or sitting in rush hour traffic or attending a WNBA game; it's so methodical and time consuming.

On our last visit to this location we were accidentally sat in a section in which the server had been cut from his/her shift. By the time we flagged down a server and everything was sorted out, we could have been halfway through our meals at Pei Wei.  Add in the wait time for a table, the sauces shtick, and presentation of the check and my head's about to explode. Chang's is more paced for retires and people on dates, not my lifestyle. I get it, it's a me problem.

With that said, the staff is very nice and helpful at this location (star). 
I can get a beer or alcoholic beverage while I wait (something that's not an option at Pei Wei) (star).
Plymouth Gin is stocked behind the bar - that's a chain first! (star).
I found a dish I love not available at Pei Wei - Salt and Pepper Prawns (star). 

So until I get sick of the Prawns or a Pei Wei opens in the Pittsburgh market, I'll continue to go to this location."}
{"text":"Server w red hair just past shoulders was awesome. She was a great asset to the staff. African American (hostess/supervisor? )was not people friendly & thought she was hot sh*t attitude was lame.
Options seem plentiful but I never see anything I want-
Lamb dish sounds amazing but was crazy blah, same w combo fried rice.. Looks great tasted DRY like well was DRY tasted like nothing!
Spicy eggplant was really really good. I like that they offer brown rice.
Same as other review- had reservation for four got table right by kitchen- spent $102"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a P.F. Chang's restaurant and I was not impressed by their food. The flavors just weren't there!

I eat at Chinese restaurants regularly in the Bay Area and I'm not a fan of non-authentic Chinese food but I thought we'd try ordering take-out and bringing it up to our room at PH. I do have to say their take-out counter is very convenient and is located next to the entrance.

We ordered the shaking beef which was too salty.  I'm a fan of salt but this dish had way too much.  The Dan Dan Noodles were ok. It was a little mushy and lacking flavor. I've had Dan Dan noodles at a lot of other places but this one tasted different. Cheesecake was good but tell them to put the raspberry sauce on the side, it tastes gross.

Overall, if you 're looking for some take-out, staying at PH, hungry for Chinese, and have enough points on your Total Rewards players card so you don't have to pay for your meal then order here and try different dishes.  P.F Chang's is just too overpriced and their food is just ok. Total price for shaking beef, Dan Dan noodles and cheesecake was $37. We could have eaten at Gordon Ramsey's BurGr again for the same price and had a good meal but were too lazy to sit down and eat at a restaurant in addition to BurGr being super busy.
I suggest going to the Rio and eating at KJ Seafood and Dim Sum if you feel like Chinese. They have much better food!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday, so we had a large party. Nevertheless, the food was terrible, I was the only one not to receive my food with the others and I had to pester the servers for my dish, then the sauces that should come with it. Despite the large party the servers were extremely unattentive and the manager was quite rude. Everything was over-priced. Can't figure out why this place was packed!"}
{"text":"I've dined at this location a few times and have yet to be let down (knock knock). Yes, they are pretty pricey. But the quality of the food is really good. Staff has always been great as well. They have a new happy hour I haven't tried. They are packed for lunch! Love love love the spicy dumplings! Yummmmy!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. It can get busy and if you don't have reservations the wait can be long, even at odd hours. The food is typical Asian inspired dishes, sort of the TGI Friday's of Chinese. Eating with a large group the service was slow."}
{"text":"Total rip off. Their food cost must be about 15%.. Large prices and small portions.."}
{"text":"My husband and I love it here!! We have never had a bad meal, everything is always fresh and perfect. Fried pork dumplings can't be beat. And Great Wall of Chocolate for dessert, every single time. Our service is always friendly and helpful, and this is one of the only chain restaurants who will always have our loyalty. 
Shout out to John P, our awesome server... Dirty Goose!!"}
{"text":"Went there last night. The place was freezing. The plates on our table and the silverware were actually icy cold. We ordered three things: calamari, the fried green beans, and the \"Thai beef noodle salad\". I was there with an asian friend, and we both know this food well. The beans were battered but so oily it gave us both a stomach ache right after dinner. The \"calamari\" came at the same time and looked like little french fries and was tasteless. Probably the worst presentation I have ever seen for that dish. So, we waited and waited for the other dish. I thought they had forgotten it, but here it comes. The Thai \"beef noodle salad\". Uhhhh, no. Not one noodle in it. I asked for the menu again to be sure it wasn't a mistake on my part.
It wasn't. Here's what we got: A completely tasteless, bland, noodle-less bowl of something, but we never really figured it out because it wasn't worth eating. Really bad. I have had this dish here and in Thailand probably 50 times. It wasn't Thai, it wasn't good, and all I can say is it was a disgrace to the country of Thailand. The person who made this had no clue and it didn't even have any \"dressing\" on it much less was it completely spiceless. Nothing. So, three strikes and you are out. Never again. So, if you want bland, tasteless, Americanized \"Chinese\" food, then this is your place.. Oh, did I forget to mention way overpriced? Uh, yeah. Way over. Good luck. Note: other PF Changs may be different. I only hope so. Avoid this one."}
{"text":"Cons: It was long waiting, tight space for seating...
Pros: great service and delicious food. The owner was walking around checking on the food. We got served free sushi for the delay which was better than the one we order. 
All in all it is a great atmosphere and enjoy the food..."}
{"text":"LOVE the food!!!!!! Try the bomb pop martini. The service has definitely Gone down hill in the past year. And when I've  told the manger he just doesn't give a shit.  It's either hit Or miss with service. But food is ALWAYS GOOD"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and at many other P.F. Chang's love the food and have never felt compelled to write a review one way or the other. The food is good and I have to say it actually is one of my favorite chain restaurants. I have dined at this particular location many times before without incident and experienced quite excellent service, but like I said I am writing this review for a reason. My family dined here last Saturday evening (May 18th) for my Grandmother's 81st birthday. The food was good but the service was some of the worst I have ever experienced. We were a party of 8 so the waiter of course was already receiving the auto 18% gratuity so he seemed like he couldn't care less. he also was clearly stoned off his ass (I'm not knocking I used to be a stoner myself and was dining with a few but I'm just stating facts here). We place our order and a lot of the food came out at different times when my husband and I mentioned that our appetizer did not yet come and the meals had. You could tell that he completely forgot about the appetizer, claimed he put in the order and about 15 minutes after we received our meal, low and behold our appetizer showed up (it was an uncooked appetizer BTW it was more than obvious he forgot). The same thing happened with my sister's appetizer, when she mentioned it you could tell he completely forgot then said, \"Hey man I totally put the in order all at the same time I wish I was back in the kitchen cooking but I can't be they are totally backed up\", in his best stoner/surfer valley girl accent ( I am also a valley girl). The appetizer eventually came at the end of our meal and it was the wrong one and my sister told them to just take it back and off the bill. My grandfather ordered a beer and it was one that only came in a bottle, fine no problem, my husband also ordered a beer at the exact same time, 20 minutes later my husband's beer shows up (draft beer) and my Grandfather's does not, my Grandfather tells the waiter to just cancel it, his response \"Are you sure man it's only gonna take 5 more minutes it's on it's way the bar is just backed up\", (the restaurant is maybe at 60% capacity and the waiter has 4 tables to work, including ours). No just cancel it how does a bottled beer take longer than a draft and why did the first one take 20 minutes to begin with? He clearly forgot until my Grandfather mentioned that he cancel it. My cousin's wine order, 30 minutes. He passed our table and promised to refill our water glasses no less than 4 times, every time saying I'll be right back to refill your water glasses, clearly forgetting to grab the pitcher every time then seeing them he would remember. His shirt was filthy, when he bagged our food he spilled more than half of it down the side of the bag. We had a warrior card that we presented at the beginning of the meal, he told us he would take it for our discount and never did and when he brought the bill which had the beer that never came, the appetizer that was canceled and no discount we had had enough. Now the way I work is I always tip even with bad service, I just tip less. Normally about 10-15% for bad and 20-25% for good but there was no way this guy was getting 18% after all of this . My sister got up to find a manager to talk to them about the bill because we were done dealing with this awful waiter she spoke with the manager the bill was adjusted she took off the 10% for the warrior card the 18% gratuity and comped some drinks, great. Then when my sister was headed back to the table for us to handle the adjusted bill she passed the waiter and he offered to take the bill my sister told him \"no thanks you haven't been much help tonight I got it\" and here's the kicker, he told her to \"f*** off\"! So crazy! We didn't report this part to the manager because at this point we could not get out of there fast enough and we had been there over 2 and half hours at that point. What an a$$, little did he know he was just talking himself out of a tip. The bill was adjusted down about $100 and we left a 10% tip on that adjusted bill but had he not been such an ass and told my sis to f*** off we would have left 15% on the original amount and called it a night. If he had said f*** off to me I would have made sure he was fired. He also topped it off with talking shit about us with another table he had just seated right behind us. He had just started off with them and was making the same excuses he had been with us but they had no clue what they were in for, they even joked with him about reporting him to the manager which was clearly a shot at us. The only pleasure I took in that was knowing what shitty service they were in for and how much they would come to regret that comment. As it is I will never dine at this PF's again, I will stick to my side of town."}
{"text":"I've been here over a dozen times. This is one of those places where when they say they close at midnight what they mean is they take orders up until midnight. (My hours are reversed and so often getting somewhere for dinner at or just before midnight is a pretty frequent thing, and for that, this place has been good.)
Until tonight.
This was one of those situations where they had an opportunity to shine and instead completely failed to do anything other than the absolute bare minimum - my two friends and I came out here for my birthday dinner, and frustratingly got locked up in traffic in front of the LINQ for literally more than half an hour, and ended up walking into PF Chang's at 12:05.
I explained and said we knew exactly what we wanted, and could order immediately (which would more than make up for the 5 mins too late we were), and they said no. The host said maybe they could do takeout, which we said is at least something, and then he came back and said no.
Didn't care if it was for my birthday or not, no effort to go ask someone like a manager or explain to the kitchen or anything like that.
Fail.
So, the food here is fine, but don't expect good staff or for them to do anything than the bare minimum."}
{"text":"This is my first review ever on yelp. We ordered  our usual favorites. Honeycrisp shrimp  orange chicken and pad Thai noodles. The chicken was dry and the batter on the shrimp was limp. Across-the-board it's the worst PF Changs we've ever eaten at. The food was bland and not fresh. The dinner was $100 and  not worth it.! Don't waste your money-  go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Had a ton of bad dinners and never wrote a review. This place is something else , personally watched 2 tables walk, but we waited cause we were drinking . After an hour and 15 min our food finally came because the \"kitchen was backed up\"
With a 1/2 empty restaurant kinda funny . Especially when the manager is walking around in his suit jacket and watching to go orders go out the door ! Maybe this manager should take his suit jacket off put a rag on his shaved head and get to work . As a small business owner my managers know you do whatever it takes to get the job DONE weather it's in your \"JOB\" description or not ! We use to love this place but won't be back anytime soon . Just pure bad management !    And as I'm writing this I just watched the 3rd table leave . Unreal ......"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful atmosphere. Try the WOK SEARED LAMB
Lamb marinated with scallions and sesame. Served with cilantro over shredded lettuce. This was a surprise menu find. 
The service was prompt and very courteous, especially when the waiter dropped a plate of our leftovers on the floor. What I mean is he had the cooks make up a fresh order for our to go bag. Good stuff. Anywho, the place is polished, the staff is courteous and this place beats with the heart of Downtown Tempe. Stop off and share a plate of noodles on your way out to the scene!"}
{"text":"The food is really great.  My favorite starter is lettuce wraps. It's really fresh. The service is excellent. They are also very generous. For a first time visitor, they will give you $10 off card. The place is also very clean and comfy. I will def. come back again. :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have come here for years. The last couple of years, however, we've noticed a decline in service. This explains the emptiness of the restaurant. When we arrived at prime dinner time there was maybe four customers in the entire place. The service was less than satisfactory and our waitress was inattentive, probably because she was busy flirting with a couple of the other waiters. The food was lukewarm and overall our experience was poor. After years of coming to this PF Chang location, we definitely won't be back. To top off the experience we were approached by panhandlers going in and coming out."}
{"text":"We visited Mesa's PF Chang's twice this month & savored each bite of our meal!  Delicious. The salt & pepper prawns always brings us back. It's the best thing on the menu!!! We heard from PF Chang's management today that they've been taken over by a business conglomerate who is planning on taking several things off of he menu on the next few months, including salt & pepper prawns!! PF Chang fans out there, join me in conveying to management not to change a thing!!! It's a success because of the products they produce -- that's why they have remained a favorite for so many years!"}
{"text":"Went back and everything was great, service was outstanding  food was good!  left full and happy"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great date night for you and your lady friend this is an excellent place to go! The outside seating right along mill ave makes it a fun and romantic spot to go and the prices aren't too bad!"}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday and the experience was wonderful. The waiter was fun and accomidating. They brought me two desserts on the house that were delicious. We made reservations and they sat us right down. We were even 5 minuets early. The manager came to are table when we were finished eating and asked if everything was good. He wish me a happy birthday and we went on our way. It couldn't have been more perfect. Awesome service! Thank you for a wonderful night!! I definately will be back!!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch at P.F. Chang today (3-31-2015) at the Perimeter  Charlotte store. Very bad customer service. Walked in stood at the desk waiting to be seated. Manager standing there yaking on the phone ( was told his name is Joe a fill in from the South Park store). I walked away from the front desk and went to wash my hands trying to give his @@@ time to finish his conversation. Came back out stood in front of him. Ask to be seated. Someone else walked in asking for and application. He stop helping me to talk to the job seeker. Bad @@@ Manager. When I finally got seated he had the nerve to ask me if everything was alright. It took him 20 mins to seat me. Resturant was not busy at the time. I was the only customer in the lobby. Resturant was only about 30% full. You have no busy with that job, Joe. Go back over to the South Park store with your snotty broke ass ugly suit wearing self. My waiter Dan was excellent and he got a 22% tip. Just because management ( Joe) act like and A- hole no way should the waiter suffer."}
{"text":"The new and less than improved renovation may include more ambiance but the reusable plastics chopsticks that are at the table in bulk seem like a sanitation issue not to mention a poor environmental choice and forget about using the forks and knives which slide off the new modern plates - mine ended in my lap and I noticed our server also had an issue with them.   Oh and thanks to their inexpensive black cloth napkins my white jeans are now covered in lint.  The newly designed menu reads more like a Red Robin menu.  Thankfully with all these \"improvements\" they haven't changed the quality of the classic items on their menu - I still love the Chang's spicy chicken and tofu lettuce wraps.   From now on, I'll stick to take-out."}
{"text":"My wife and I are new to the valley and originally from New York. we went here for a Saturday night dinner to celebrate our anniversary, and boy we were surprised with the service & food. yes, for Chinese food it's a bit pricey. but the menu is wide, the  quality is great, everything was tasty and we really enjoyed the service. on top of that they gifted us for a first time visit and/or anniversary, not sure why for which of the one, but it doesn't matter. we will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere typical of PF which I'm okay with! Wasn't too busy this day and noise was at a low level. Service was fast and friendly. Brown rice a bit dry. Shrimp n lobster sauce was okay! I was hungry or may have given one less star!"}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences in present memory. I took my elder parents the store Superstion Springs blvd for my mother's 79th birthday and we could not have had a more miserable experience. First we made reservations for 530, well below a normal dinner rush and was given the worst table in the restuarant next to the kitchen.  Not only was it next to the kitchen where I was sitting at the table, because they manager/hostess did not give enough room for people to walk by, I was ask three times by the hostess to tuck my seat in so they could get people by.  Here is an idea chose a different route through the restaurant.  secondly as we were next to the kitchen I was bumped twice by the servers swinging around the corner, while they apologized this should not be happening.  Furthermore busing of our table was nonexistant as I stake dishes that sat for at least 5 minutes each time as multiple servers and managers walked by the table. Top it off with the food was cold and I had to send it back to get reheated. Where the manager broguht it back who was poitnless. I worked in the rest industry for years in every facet and this one of the worst run experiences I have had in a long time. We set a rez we should in turn be given a table that is at least middle of the road not the worst and having our food come out cold, my mother was to proud to sen dit back it unforgivable. I take clients out to lunch on a regular basis and 2-3 times a month I will take them to a PF Changs as it is good suburban Asian food, I will never take them to a Pf Changs again.  I was goign to refrain from saying anything more than awhat I had alreayd told the staff as we were leaving but having lunch with my mother today and hear express how unhappy she was with her birthday dinner, as shed said at least the company was good. Horrible experience"}
{"text":"We ordered the Pad Thai, Kaleidoscope Roll, and a Fish Bowl (I think that's what it was called lol)
There was some miscommunication and instead of the Fish Bowl (a hugeee cocktail) I got a regular Tequila Tai Punch :(
It still tasted great though so the disappointment wasn't that big.
We also got a complementary Kung Pao Chicken so that sure made up for it!
The Kaleidoscope Roll was very disappointing, it was very plain :(
The arrangement of the roll was not very pretty either which was a big disappointment but it didn't taste BAD.
The Pad Thai wasn't mine and I didn't eat the Kung Pow Chicken so I don't know what they tasted like but they smelled yummy :')"}
{"text":"This is largely a review for Sean, a managing partner at this location. I had gone to this location while in town with my family for the holidays, looking for a non-cooking escape before getting inundated with guests. A few of us ordered the lunch special with soups, my mom had ordered the butternut squash ravioli, and we also got an order of street noodles and started with summer rolls. Everything was great (the street noodles in particular are fantastic), but the service was a bit of a disaster- dishes came out more than 10 minutes apart from each other, a huge mood killer with a big family meal; a few dishes came out dirty; soups didn't come out at all; and our waitress made up excuses and didn't apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders. We were feeling really ignored and discouraged, until we let Sean know. He took great care of us and went way, way out of his way to make up the experience. I really can't thank Sean enough for making sure we left in a good mood after what could have been a very negative experience. Heaven knows that a positive tone is ESSENTIAL going into the holidays with family!"}
{"text":"Good food, service and atmosphere. Had Chang' spicy chicken, tasted fresh and flavorful. Ask for the trio sauce if you prefer a little extra heat."}
{"text":"Loved it and the food was great. Service was excellent and the waiter gave us a complimentary full dish of beef and free drinks after we complimented him and the restaurant for their quick service. What a nice gesture for a restaurant to do! Waiter continuously asked us how was the food and if he can get us anything elsethat we wanted. After a full satisfied dinner the casino was a stone's throw away and gambled and enjoyed our staSo how bad is that?? Excellent experience at P.F. Changs in Planet Hollywood Vegas. A must to visit!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere.  Good food, a little pricey depending on what you order.  Clean dining area and bathroom.  Good service.  Parking on street.  This place is nice.  I like the outside seating option providing it's not 900 degrees out, but if it is, they have the misters which are refreshing/somewhat annoying.  I would recommend this place, seems worth the money."}
{"text":"Horrible food and horrible service.  Stay away from egg drop soup as it is disgusting.  Just to top it off, we get our three sauces for our food and we are over half way finished.  Apparently, the server was busy.  

Oh and did I mention a fork with food particles still on it?  

Never thought I would say this but I would rather go to Panda Express in GVR's food court than this place."}
{"text":"Went out to dinner with my boyfriend and we decided on PF Changs in Anthem. Service was horrible. Couldn't get a refill to save my life. Food was \"ok\". Only thing remotely good was the Dynamite Shrimp. RICE? Tasted like it had been microwaved left overs from 3 nights ago! I cook better rice at home! Very, very disappointed. After the shitty service from our overwhelmed waitress who only had 3 tables in her section, the mediocre food from which we had high expectations from, we definitely won't be returning to ANY Pf Changs location unless it's in a new city... and thats being nice."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Friendly service.  Always a special place to enjoy a special meal.  Atmosphere is always relaxing. Brandon was a great help in recommending which dishes to try. Thank you."}
{"text":"Gave Chang's another chance this week, and this time the service was much better. Quite friendly and efficient, as a matter of fact. Shared the Salt and Pepper Prawns and Shrimp Fried Rice, and both were delicious. I've always liked their food. No, it's not the greatest or most original Asian food around, but it's pretty good. It's the service that I've struggled with - but if they're able to maintain the level they displayed the other day, I will definitely continue to grace their restaurant with my presence. Ha!

Oh, also told our waiter about my fortune-less fortune cookie on my last visit, and he apologized profusely, said they got a bad batch last month in which one out of every three cookies was empty. The problem had been resolved, he assured me, and sure enough this time I got a fortune. Not a very good one, something about me having a deep appreciation of the arts and music (Well, duh), but hey, it was a fortune. Sort of. Ok, not really. But it was a saying on a little piece of paper, which was all I really wanted.."}
{"text":"Good, consistent food and really good service.  Whether dining in or carrying out we've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Gross. I haven't had PF Chang's in a few years until recently. Ate several of their dishes that were ordered to go. The food was absolutely (and surprisingly) terrible!! It had all the wrong flavors. Orange chicken tasted nothing like I am used to (in a very bad way). The egg rolls were the only half good item that I ate. Everything out of the 7+ dishes that I ate was not worth eating. Believe it or not I think that Panda Express (yes the fast food version of Chinese) would have tasted better than what I ate. I do not know how this restaurant is so popular?!"}
{"text":"The few times I've been here have been hit or miss, but tonight was a complete miss on all fronts. There were three of us dining tonight, and one entree came in way too early. After the Manager's apology, you would think that they would make sure everything is good from thereon, but then my entree did not come in at all. To top it off, the soup we ordered came in after the entrees. The banana role kind of made up for it, and the Manager comped the late entree and the soup."}
{"text":"THe food here was not good. We ordered several dishes including the dumplings, seafood, and noodles. I didnt like any of it and would definitely not go back"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I absolutely would. I have been frequenting this specific PF Changs for over ten years, but after tonight, I will never go again. I've been a huge fan since I was 12, and unfortunately tonight ruined it for me for the rest of my life. I went in for a celebratory dinner with my boyfriend, whereupon we checked in with the two smug looking hostesses who didn't seem thrilled with their jobs.We watched as countless parties were seated before us as well as another party of three which was waiting since before we arrived. A gentleman from said party of three grew frustrated and went up to smug hostess number one and asked why some of these tables were sat before him, to which she explained the first table had a reservation, and he had overheard that the second table (a party of 4) did not have a reservation when they checked in but were still seated before him. He asked why and she didn't seem to have any answer but apologized lightly, he then resumed his seat and my boyfriend and I watched smug hostess number one look around for hostess number two, or any other employee for that matter, to make extra smug eye contact with as if to communicate her irritation with this group, though she was wrong. STRIKE ONE. Once my boyfriend and I were finally seated, a nice server came to help us. We both ordered ice waters without lemon. When the water arrived and I plunged my straw into said water, I was astonished to see a cloud of murk emerge from the depths of my cup. It looked like random white floaty shreds of gunk. I don't know what this unknown substance was, but needless to say, I lost my appetite. STRIKE TWO. It made me question the cleanliness of the entire establishment, and it made me feel dirty and I honestly can say I won't be going back ever. I'm sad about this because I love the garlic noodles here, but I will have to live without them for fear of eating from dirty dishes. It's disgusting. The health board should probably investigate this... I don't think proper procedure and cleanliness are being executed."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the Kung Pao Shrimp.  Hard to recommend anything else since that is the only thing I have ever ordered there.  Egg drop soup is really thick and rich.  Mongolian beef looked really good too."}
{"text":"I just had carry out Mongolian Beef which was terrible.  The beef was dry and way over cooked as if it was a leftover from a prior order and had been sitting in the pan for a while.  There was none of the brown sauce in the beef container either.  Apparently they don't appreciate carry out business and give leftovers to people who are not sitting in the restaurant to complain."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.

So... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.

I started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \"pork\"-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.

Next came my \"lunch-portion\" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). 

At the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. 

On my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.

Glaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.

I've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The \"lunch-portion\" cost was $9.95.

At The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.

The service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs."}
{"text":"There wasn't anything unique about the dishes, but it was satisfying. The service was excellent though. Our waiter was prompt, informative, and very friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty consistent in their cooking. I usually go for street noodles,  honey shrimp, and changs spicy chicken.  I mostly order take away online. I'm usually there sooner than the expected pick up time and usually the food is ready a few minutes after that time.  Prefer to pick up my food as is finished than let it idling on

PS their new hunan wings..... amazing!! It has a great spice level, with sweetness, and amazing crisp. Best to eat at home as life gets messy with these wings."}
{"text":"We got there around 9 pm the place was packed so we went to the bar to have a drink waiting for our 30 minute wait time. Immediately after seat in our bar stool the bartender was there to ask for our drinks and if we wanted a menu. The best choice we have made since we have been in Vegas this week , the service was attentive and quick with a strong desire to make us happy with anything we needed. Wow I will start thinking of eat at bars now"}
{"text":"Delicious, a bit overpriced for what it is. Make a reservation, they will seat you right away, no need to wait."}
{"text":"Good as always.  P.F. Changs never dissapoints.  I've had just about everthing on the menu, and I can't complain.  Mongolian beef is awesome.  VIP duck is terrific.  Salt and pepper praws are always a hit.  Double pan fried noodles are a must.  And orange chicken gotta love it."}
{"text":"The waitress wearing glasses with short dark hair obviously hates her job and should really be taught by management how to treat customers! 

Not only did she have a attitude from the moment she saw us sitting I'm her section. My husband ordered a beer the chilled glass had lime chunks stuck to it and when he pointed out that she rolled her eyes and said I'll get you a new one.. She proceeded to chat with another table, take an order, take food out to another table, when she came back still no chilled glass!

Then food came out wrong and she tried to argue with me that I didn't order it like that! Ummm yes I did! Needless to say, my husband still tipped her 20% because we both have worked in hospitality, but this PF Chang's really needs to train their employees or at least have management actually walk around and ask is everything ok like most PF Chang's."}
{"text":"Every time I walk through the big glass doors of PF Changs, I hate myself a little more. I tell myself, \"That summer I spent in China won't make me jaded when it comes to Chinese food\" but I'm wrong. Though I admit... I've been jaded when it comes to Chinese food since I came to Arizona. I used this line before in my review for George and Son's in Scottsdale, but Arizona feels like the land that Chinese food forgot. Every single place out here that I have tried (other than PF Changs) uses low quality meat, large amounts of MSG, and overall is disappointing in every aspect. This is why I go to PF Changs.

I come from Philadelphia, which has a pretty large Chinatown. When I first learned of the Chinese situation here, a tear rolled down my cheek. Chinese food is a staple to my existence (as someone who is Jewish, my Christmas's would be lost without it!). I try my hardest to allow PF Changs fill this void while I am here.

While I admire the service and the atmosphere, and some dishes are alright, it just doesn't do it for me. The portions are very tiny, the prices are high, and I hate the commercialization. 

My personal recommendation is to get the Chicken Chow Fun. For the price, this is the largest thing on the menu. This is a dish of wide egg noodles with large white meat cuts of chicken.

Here is a picture for reference (though this is Beef Chow Fun):

http://jadecafe2565.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/Beef_Chow_Ho_Fun-3.29102408_std.JPG

Sometimes this comes with the noodles undercooked. Sometimes this comes drowning in sauce. Though most of the time it comes just right.  I grew to love this dish after my time over there. It is a staple street food that I could get for 5 RMB at the most (around 70 cents). Nothing PF Changs can come up with even touches the lowest tier of Chinese cuisine over there.

PF Changs and myself were in a marriage of convenience. Once I leave Arizona, I don't see myself ever setting foot in one ever again."}
{"text":"I have been to PF Changs many many times. This is the only location I seem to have a problem with. Last time my friend and I went to have lunch and I order the chicken fried rice. Huge amount for under 9.00 so cant beat that. My problem was after about 10 bites I start chewing on egg shells and had to send it back. They offered to replace it, but come on?! I was so grossed out I didnt want to eat that.  I went to grab take out (chicken fried rice again) last Sunday. I waited about 10 minutes in line and I was on my way. I get home, open it up and all my chicken was burned black. So after picking the chicken out so I could eat it I AGAIN found shells in my rice. I will never been eating at this location again. I will drive out of my way to get a good product from Chandler. Same for them too, I normally go there 2-3 times a month."}
{"text":"I've been to several PF Chang's and Pei Wei (the low cost version of PF Chang's in the SW), and this one is by far the worst I have been to.  You would think that at a chain like PF Chang's, the food would be relatively consistent, right?  I thought so too until visiting this location last night.  The food was of poor quality, not well prepared and came out cold after a long wait.  Ugh... miserable from end to end.  Perhaps we just caught them on an off night, but it was really off..."}
{"text":"Please stop changing things. ..every 3 months there are new changes.  Happy hour is only outside and at the bar now, no cup of wonton soup now only you xan buy a bowl.  

Love the new lunch menu but hate the constant changes..."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of P.F. Chang's because it is a mega chain. I do, or I used to, like some of their dishes but now that I am a veggie/celiac I am no longer a fan. 

Although P.F. Chang's has a gluten-free menu which is very helpful if you eat meat the option for a vegetarian is the Buddha's Feast which is a bowl of bland steamed veggies. Blah - you don't even get the option of any tofu or any spices or herbs...

And although normally I am willing to give 3 stars to a place that at least tries to accommodate a variety of diets, this particular P.F. Chang's gets a 2 star due to the terrible delivery of food. My full order of garlic snap peas (which is really quite good) came out as a half order. I had to ask whether it was a half and finally they sent out another half. Good thing I caught it otherwise we would have paid for the full. Then when I ordered the Buddha's Feast, I was asked if I wanted it stir fried to add some flavor and I said sure - that sounds great! But, when I received my dish, it was a bowl of steamed veggies (and not even fresh looking). When I inquired what happened to my stir fried version, another server explained something about a matrix and that the kitchen would have to do some stuff and yadda yadda. Well, in the end, I had to eat these boring, bland and flavorless steamed veggies.

I was also promised the gluten-free soy sauce which only came after I asked for it twice.

I gave P.F. Chang's a 2 star rating because the rest of my group enjoyed their meal for the most part. The beef and broccoli was so salty they couldn't eat it. The chow fun, the sweet n sour shrimp and the chicken lettuce wraps are what allowed me to give a 2 star rating.

Please make the mushroom lettuce wraps gluten-free and then I will be a fan of P.F. Chang's - buddha's feast just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Another P.F. Changs that didn't disappoint! I came here with my mom recently and did the 2 for $40 deal. It is A LOT of food for the price and we ended up taking some home, as usual. The service is always good and the food is consistent. Love P.F.'s"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick late night bite to eat and came across this place which was one of the only restaurants still open. As a last resort I decided to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised at how yummy everything was.... and at a descent price too. I will definitely be back, but next time I will ask for a booth. The smaller tables are packed very tightly next to each other."}
{"text":"Love this Place...you can't go wrong with PF Changs!  Had to wait a bit for a table but well worth it!"}
{"text":"We tried their Mongolian beef and their Kung pao shrimp for dinner, and had some sort of fried wonton dish for appetizers.  The flavors are ok for a fusion type place but it was on the salty side.  We drank more soda and ate more rice to compensate for the saltiness.  The bright side was the servers were great.  All were working as a team and bringing/removing plates/drinks etc.  We'd go back on a less hectic day to try them again before we write them off since their servers were awesome."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight with my wife and 15 month old son and was a disaster. We ordered the 4 course dinner for 2 and waited forever for our server to even take our order. Then after the apps came, the dinner entrées took 45 minutes to come out after the apps!!! Our server never came around between the apps  and the main course. I used to come here all the time and not sure if we're going to return."}
{"text":"Torey is absolutely amazing! He made sure we had everything we could possibly need and got us refills before we noticed we needed one! Everything was timely and delicious. He always made sure he got everything right by repeating it back to us, which is very important. My experience prior was pretty awful; He makes me wanna come back!"}
{"text":"It was pretty busy but there was no wait for patio seating and the service was awesome! Try the ma po tofu it's da bomb!!!"}
{"text":"The service and food is horrible at this location.  I have eaten at a number of P F Chang\"s at different locations and never had a problem.  We arrived at about 3:30 for a late lunch and there were only about 10 or 12 people in the restaurant.  The service was terrible and the food came out cold.  If you decide to visit this location, just remember, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED."}
{"text":"There's something about the P.F. Changs in Vegas that I just love. The food is incredible, the staff is nice, and the view is great! I like eating outside where I can sightsee. It's right on the strip conveniently located inside Planet Hollywood hotel, so when you're done eating you can shop around. I love it!"}
{"text":"This has only been the second time in 10 years that I have gone to PF Changs. The food was good, I think it's a bit over rated. But it's nice to be able to tell that your chicken, is actually chicken. That's always a bonus."}
{"text":"would you believe that this was my second visit to this restaurant in the last several months and was served the wrong entree both times?  The service was slow to begin with and then I had to wait again for the correct entree.  When the correct food came it was just OK.  Everything was pretty tasteless.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Had such a great time here! Our server, HEATHER, was such a joy and a genuinely nice person. My goodness the food was great and was worth the money. Heather had great suggestions and really knew her stuff. Would go back of my wallet was up for it. The music was a but overwhelming but who cares when you're indulging yourself in the Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food although it takes them sometimes a very long time  to sit us. I still love their Mongolian beef and their hot and sour soup is to die for!"}
{"text":"Two dinners here.  Food is decent with enough variety to offer something for anyone.  MaPo Tofu was nothing like the typical dish, but very, very good!  Just not authentic.  The deep fried green beans were great.  Lettuce wraps one of our favorite. Liked the beef with broccoli, although light in the broccoli.  In general sauces are over done, too heavy and lacking any finesse.   Bar earns one less star.  Whiskey sour was overly sweet.  Lemon drop lacked much lemon.  And couldn't manage a Negroni.  Good wait staff.  But hey!  We chose to eat here twice in a week."}
{"text":"I called earlier this evening to request call ahead seating, but they only do reservations (for 1 hour in advance). Whoever answered the phone was slightly rude, and hung up on me before I could give her my name, so when we arrived our reservations were no where to be found. We had to wait a few minutes but it was no big deal; the table we were sat at was probably the worst in the restaurant though - directly beside the hostess station by the front door. Very cold / loud. 

But the service once we sat down was great! Our waiter was friendly and the food was fantastic - we highly recommend the egg drop soup & crab wontons. I really liked the Kung pow chicken and my date had the sesame chicken, which was also good. The vanilla wonton was super disappointing, so pass on those. 

Overall great experience once there but the phone service wasn't great; in their defense it was a Friday night so I get that they were busy."}
{"text":"My son and I both had the beef and broccoli and the beef was so tough you could not even chew it.  I sent an e-mail to them and they responded by sending me 1 coupon for their beef and broccoli.  Why would they send me only 1 coupon and for an item I would never order there again (or anything else for that matter).  I will not use the coupon and will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I had some awesome lettuce wraps! It was a nice place and everyone was welcoming. The crispy honey chicken wasn't crispy and I feel like katos chicken in the mall is better and for more then half the price. Overall the food came out quick and if you go there try something more unique and get the lettuce wraps!"}
{"text":"We were given a $50 gift card for Christmas, and this past weekend we decided to use it by ordering lunch to bring back home.  We ordered calamari, 2 spring rolls, honey chicken, orange chicken and 2 PB treats.  We were anticipating this to last us several meals and were very surpised when the order was brought out in a small plastic basket.  
In the car my husband asked what smells so fishy.  My guess it was the calamari, and that should have been the first indicator of the quality of this meal.   Everything except the spring rolls were dissapointing.  The calamari looked like it had freezer burn and was extremely rubbery.  Calamari should be rings or the tendrils, but all the pieces looked like old dried out french fries one would find under the seat of their car.  
The chicken entrees were small, mushy, and tasted like they were frozen dinners.  The treat was too sweet, way too much sugar.  

We will not be returning, the food was gross and overpriced."}
{"text":"I was badly craving asian food and decided to give PF Chang's a try.  Being a lone diner since I was in town for business, I was worried that they were going to ignore me or sit me in a crappy area to hide me.  However, the service was great.  I was glad to see my food come quickly and taste good.  

I had the lettuce wraps, crab rangoon, and a cup of their hot and sour soup.  All three were excellent.  I would definitely recommend this place to business travelers who might be staying in the area.  (There are a lot of hotels near by)"}
{"text":"Had a nice celebration with the family. We decided to dine at pf changs at GVR district in henderson. We have had good experiences, except for today. 
We ordered several dishes to share with our family. The fried rice was not fully cooked. The steamed rice was not fully cooked either. We sat right by the window so we can see everything in the kitchen. We asked for cooked rice and brought the same uncooked rice to the table. The manager that was working the shift did not do anything for us. We will never go back to the PF Changs at green valley district... Be aware...."}
{"text":"Went here the first time, was seated fast, upon the food being placed on table noticed a strong odor of a sort like sewer that mimicked something that didnt belong in a restaurant. I started eating the shrimp rice, rolls, was delicious, the sea bass however is terrible I figured it was the source of the foul odor and tastes like stomach acids during a stomach flu. After eating it the waiter asked specificly if we liked the sea bass, and he loves and dreams of it. Maybe its an acquired taste, but the food is great."}
{"text":"I'm giving stars because it's easy to dine here even with a weird mix of food allergies in our group (soy and dairy for one, gluten for another).  They have a gluten-free menu and were able to print off a list of items that are dairy-free as well.  Soy-free required a little more finagling, but we made it work. So, in the subcategory of \"willingness to accommodate allergies,\" I would give it 5 stars.

It's not great for kids, though.  There's no kids menu and it felt like a very grown up environment, which isn't necessarily bad, but wasn't ideal for my young niece and nephew.  However, the waiter was happy to suggest some kid-friendlier dishes.  The kids really liked the ENORMOUS horse statues outside the front door though and did amuse themselves with chopsticks, so that was something.

LOTS of parking is available, but you have to wind through the sprawling mass of new restaurants etc. on the west side of Middleton to get there, which makes me think of zoning laws and the use of urban versus agricultural space more than it whets the appetite.  The service was good; our waiter appeared well-trained and the bartender was fine with me ordering green tea at the bar, though I she advised me to let it steep longer than I would suggest (unless you like your tea bitter).

Overall, nice effort, odd location, nice staff, good for groups of adults.  The outdoor seating was a rather unappealing proposition in the height of a flood mosquito plague, but that's common sense enough in this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, great service, amazing food (I ordered the honey chicken, didn't disappoint!), and nice atmosphere. Would recommend to anyone looking for authentic Asian food. Great experience, our server was really nice and got us seated in no time at all! They even put the food in the box for us! If you're looking for a fun night this is the place! Only given four stars because of the fortune cookies. Not that great. Overall, this is an amazing place!"}
{"text":"The food is always good and the service is excellent and this last visit was no exception. Our server Alex went above and beyond what we expected we were I think the largest party there and he stayed on top of everything during our entire meal, he kept our glasses full and took care of every request from all of us."}
{"text":"Outstanding service here at changs! The service was great with plenty of brown/white rice to go with the menu. The sauces were made perfect and they even helped out with combination plates if you wanted to try something different. Perfect place to eat and great settings. Great place to eat if your wanting something culturally different."}
{"text":"I have been to pf chang's many times and the food was quite good. Me and my husband went there recently and i feel that their quality has gone down. We ordered vegetable dumplings and it was very bad. We could hardly find any veggies inside. We also ordered vegetable fried rice and it was just average."}
{"text":"PF Changs In Vegas Location: So the PF Changs where I live is absolutely GREAT! So you would think that all locations would posess the same state of mind when it comes to customer service!  WELL I thought absolutely wrong!! I have eaten at this location a few times in the past year but nothing compares to the experience I had here just this October.  We sat at the bar and it was early bout 2:00 and it was a lil busy but not overwhelming.  The bartender was sooo FREAKIN rude right from the start.  We sat there for literally 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged he would just walk right by us like we were ghosts! Not even a courtesy \"I'll be right with you\".  So were like watever right and then this couple walks in 20 mins later and sits right next to us and the same thing happenes to them, Well when the lady asked the bartender if she could just order a drink this is wat the rude bartender said \"NO not right now...I'm only one person here!!\"  I was shocked!!  And so was the lady!!  Of course I butt in and told him he shouldnt be so rude and then he just totally lost it.  I got up and went to speak with the manager but he didnt give a shit either!  I Love PF CHangs but I will NEVER step foot in this inconsiderate location again!!"}
{"text":"I am very sad to write this review....this has always been a favorite neighborhood restaurant.  Our experience this evening was significantly lacking in quality.  The egg drop soup had very little flavor and was an odd color.   The entrees our party ordered all were overcooked and lacking in flavors. Specifically we had the honey shrimp-too sweet and shrimp not fresh, surf & turf, Kung Pow chicken-very bland and oily, and other items.  I'm have been coming to PF Chang's both in the restaurant and also take out, for so many years and will probably try again but we were very disappointed.  Service was just ok, not spectacular unfortunately."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a PF Changs in almost 2 years & my girlfriend Renee was in town & mentioned she loved this place. I had a $50 gc so I figured it was the perfect place to go. We got there around 2pm on new years eve. It was pretty packed & they said there was a 15 minute wait. We sat at the bar to order a cocktail while we waited. Not even a minute later they said a table opened up. I forgot her name, but our server was really sweet & talked about the Bucks with my lunch date (she lives in Ohio & goes to school there). 

For starters we ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. A pretty yummy app but nothing special IMO, Renee loved it though. For cocktails; Renee ordered the organic agave marg & I ordered the pf-x. Both were yummy but mine was amazing! For our entrees we decided to share the crispy honey shrimp & the orange peel chicken, both with white rice. Always thinking of my hubby, I ordered him the almond & cashew chicken (but ditch the almonds & add extra cashews) to go. All entrees were good, but again nothing special & overpriced if you ask me. Our server was kind enough to offer a couple dessert shots on the house, we ordered the raspberry cheesecake & triple chocolate mousse. Both were pretty good & the perfect size. 

Total (without tip) was $73, ugh-so glad I had that $50 gc! Overall the food & drinks were good, but I'm not really dying to come back."}
{"text":"I had the worst restaurant experience in my life tonight. Started out ok because it was dead and things got worse from there. Server was very hurried and was ok. Problem was the food took about 30 minutes. The manager delivered our food and did apologize. We asked why the food took so long and her response was that they were busy. She came back to the table with an attitude and said she took our appetizer off and then proceeded to show me a time stamp of the order process and said it was only 26 minutes. I was shocked. I told her that I am a restaurant manager and I would never bring a time ticket to a table and argue with a guest. She then asked me if I was going to cause a scene. At that point, I just wanted to get out of there. We had 2 bites of food at that point. After I asked the manager for her card, she rolled her eyes and walked away. She then came back and comped the meal, which I was not looking for. This was the second bad experience at this location in 3 years. With management like that, they will never see me again!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this location for at least 10 years and always had a pleasant experience until now.  We were seated right away which was great but the service was slow and both chicken dishes were over cooked - chicken was extremely dry and edges crispy (had a hard time even trying to cut it with a knife).  I sent my plate back and asked for it to be removed from the bill as we didn't have time for them to remake it being that we had already been there almost a hour. My son ate his only because he was starving!!  I somewhat expected a manager to stop by the table seeing that I sent a plate back but no one did.  Will definitely think twice about going back."}
{"text":"What can you say?  It's a chain, it all tastes the same and this place is always good!

We had two couples in the group and each split a Changs for two deal.  Comes with your choice of soup (2), an appetizer, two entrees with sides of rice, and a dessert to share.  IT IS A LOT OF FOOD, but it is SO GOOD!  Neither of us finished it all.

Try to eat on the patio if the weather permits or along the windows facing the strip.  It offers a really nice view at night when everything is lit up.  The overall feel of the restaurant is like any other PF Changs, intimate, loungy, and sleek.  This one in particular was more brightly lit on the inside compared to some I've been to in the past.

The server we had was AWESOME, his name was Melique and I hope I spelled his name correctly.  He deserves an award.  He was knowledgeable, personable, quick, and overall a lot of help.

The only thing I will dock this location for is for leaving an entire round table right next to us dirty for our entire meal, about 1 hour.  The table was covered with food, spilled drinks, crayons, napkins and worst of all right by the front door and next to two occupied tables.  I cannot believe nobody came over to clean it!

Overall a great experience and will for sure be back.  Oh and will definitely be eating those leftovers in the fridge!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the poor quality of the food we ordered and picked up last night was because it was New Year's Eve.  Maybe so, but if we were seated in the restaurant ~ we would have walked out! Poor, don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying We loved this place! We'd Eat here for dinner and lunch on numerous occasions and the food would be on point! It's been a few months that we've eaten here so we decided to take out dinner on our last visit it's a shame to say it was the WORST It was about an hour before closing that We had ordered our food for take out, we ordered the Chicken lettuce wraps , Crispy green beans , Changs spicy chicken, and an order of chicken and egg fried rice with no veggies (made that very clear)  ..... What we got? I honestly couldn't even tell you. We live no more then 5 minutes from this place they told us about 25 min it would be ready , when we open our food the green beans were cold and soggy like they picked them off someone's plate that left an hour ago the rice was hard and stuck together like it's been under the heat lamp with vegetables in it no taste what so ever. The changs spicy chicken was bland and the lettuce wraps lets just say I'm not ordering them any more! We called after our pick up and spoke to Erin the manager I told her I will gladly bring the food back we didn't even really touch anything . she apologized and because their kitchen was unfortunately closing and the restaurant was closing as well she could refund our money back onto a Pf Changs gift card ... I was very appreciative but that's not a chance I want to even take going back. So we had picked up a Thai chicken salad from tropical smoothie that was 10x better then what we were served! Beyond disappointed 50$ sitting on a card we most likely won't use."}
{"text":"Very poor service and the quality of the food has recently declined dramatically. We took our out of town guests there last night for dinner and our food arrived before our appetizers and the rice for our meals never arrived. We were agreeable to the waiter bringing out our appetizers and eating them with our dinner.  However he never showed up with our rice...Chinese food without any rice... Go figure.

After about 10 minutes we located a manager explained the situation and he was agreeable to bring us our rice however all of our meals were already cold. Keep in mind during this time we could never get our waiter's attention.

The manager had all our meals remade and offered to give us some financial consideration.  So when the check came we had a $70 bill, with what appeared to be a $150 discount.  At first I thought that was really generous, and was going to tip the waiter 20% of $230. But then someone pointed out our bill could not have been that high, so I looked at the bill in detail and sure enough, the manager DOUBLED THE BILL, by actually charging us twice for everything and then showed us a discount. Talk about sneaky.. 

So in the end, cold food, poor service and double billing to show a discount.

I have been dining regularly at PF Changs in Kierland for 20 years, it will be awhile before I go back.."}
{"text":"Went to the Scottsdale P.F.Chang's  The waitress suggested the Ginger Chicken with Broccoli.  I love veggies so order her suggestion.  The brown rice came in a small dish and was very dry and I hardly had enough to mix with the entree; plus there was no room on the plate to stir the meal.  The broccoli surrounded the chicken on the plate.  The broccoli was steamed and now getting cold since it was not mixed with sauce and chicken.  Mixing it with the sauce would have added flavor too.  As I ate the broccoli, I noticed the sauce was under the chicken only.  I asked the waitress why wasn't the dish all stir fried together.  The sauce would have helped keep the broccoli warm and flavorful.   She suggested next time I am in for a meal, tell them and they will stir fry that dish.  Isn't this an Asian type restaurant?  She did not offer to have the chef stir fry the remaining meal.  I had only eaten a little of the broccoli.  Humm..  Not  very smart.  I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"As always very good food! Never a bad item! The hot and sour soup was fantastic and the Chang's spicey chicken was delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of PF Chang's food, and when you combine it with this great location, you just can't lose.  We were there recently and apparently some beauty pageant was going on because about 50 women wearing sashes with state names walked by as we were eating.  Needless to say, all the guys around were gawking.  That aside, the food was great as usual.  I really like everything here, but the one thing that always stands out for me is the flourless chocolate dome.  Please, save room for dessert."}
{"text":"I gave this place five stars because the price was great.  We got away with an excellent meal for only $25 each and that included a drink.  I thought this was pretty good for Vegas.

The food was very good, and there was a ridiculously large amount of it, so nobody went hungry.

The server was great, we had a reservation and got seated early, even on a Saturday night.

All in all, much better than some of the places I've been to in Vegas."}
{"text":"Usually I am very pleased with my meal when we have eaten in, but this time we ordered food for pick up. The shrimp tempura roll was pretty much inedible. The shrimp was not peeled! I don't even know how that could happen. The honey glazed chicken was mushy and did not have enough sauce to flavor the soggy white rice. They also forgot our chopsticks and fortune cookies. The lettuce wraps were delicious as always and the California roll was good. I guess you just have to know what to order when you get take out."}
{"text":"My wife  and  I have dinner here on my birthday.
What a terrible food experience.
The \"beef with broccoli\" was \"extremely\" SALTY and I had to tell tell the waitress. They took off  its cost of my bill.
Both brown and white rice were very DRY !"}
{"text":"Best for chkn lettuce wrap, dynamite shrimp, pad thai. Almost all the dishes are prepared with great taste!!"}
{"text":"I ate there tonight, and it was good as usual. Except that I prefer the oder location at Kierland, I took the Singapore Street Noodles and I try for desert 2pc Chocolate Raspberries Yummy Yummy. I will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Good food and good service.

If you're planning to eat at this location on a Friday or Saturday I would recommend making reservations to avoid the long wait."}
{"text":"Although service here was prompt for a busy Saturday night,  we placed our order for a dinner for two priced at 49.95 per the menu.  After dinner the waitress asked if we were ready for desert, some
Banana rolls.  We declined and she insisted.  I said no really and she says no, you have to try them.  Again we said no thank you and she says well I have to bring it out, but it's ok you'll love it! When she brought our tab, it was charged per item, including the dessert we declined but was supposed to be a part of the dinner for two. When brought to her attention, she quickly blamed her manager for doing it all wrong.  She came back with it still wrong and again blames her manager.  Finally, the matter is rectified.  We leave our monies and tip on the table, as well as two untouched desserts, and leave.  She then proceeds to chasing our friend out into the casino accusing him of shorting her and announces she will not cover him! Embarrassed, he goes back in with her, assuring her he left her the right amount and a tip.  He asks her to show her the folder and she can't find it.  The manager dismisses it since she can't prove anything.  What an odyssey!  I recommend trying other culinary adventures while Sin City!"}
{"text":"Cleanliness:  Dining area was good 5 stars. Can't comment on the bathrooms. 

Food:  Sweet n sour chicken for me, 4 stars, lacking just a but of flavor.  Double pan fried noodles for my wife, 2 stars, drenched in sauce (there was a $&!& load of it per my wife).  Hot and sour soup, amazing per my wife, 5 stars. Fried wantons good, 4 stars. 

Service:  Excellent. She was prompt, checked on us, but not overly so. She was personable, asked my wife if her meal was gross when she saw how much sauce was on it and would have taken it back if my wife asked her.  5 stars

Ambiance:  Kind of noisy with a lot of people always up and walking around, whether employees or customers.  It's good if you're with a big group in for a party which there were a few, not so much if you're in for a nice quiet night with your girl.  3-5 stars depending on what your there for."}
{"text":"Good happy hour 3 to 6 everyday. Cute staff and patrons. Lotsa girls. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"AWESOME resturant!!  Great service, great food.  Always classy!  A bit expensive but worth the price."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Oolong sea bass & mongolian beef is to die for! We had the best service from nicholas!!!"}
{"text":"I did take out here as I need a quick dinner and it met the mark.  I really like the fact that you can get brown rice and the prices are pretty reasonable.  I liked the mapo tofu but the guy who took the order over the phone insisted it wasn't fried and it was.  Other than that, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service.  I'll start off by saying this was our last shot at giving PF Chang our business because of a horrible dining experience the last time we dined in.

We got there right at the start of dinner service.  There was no wait but the two of us started the night's waiting list.  We were told 5 minutes.  We were seated in the foyer and watched 12 customers leave after eating.  12!  Were we seated?  Nope.  We watched about 20-25 more people come in and get on the list before we were finally seated after a 20 minute wait.  I even asked the hostess how much longer and she replied with a \"snippy\" answer that we were next.  Really?  We were next?  I think we could have figured that out since we were the first ones on the list.

Waitress was very friendly but the service was atrocious.  We ordered a bottle of wine which took a while to get to us.  When it did, my wine glass was disgusting.  It took 7 minutes to get a new glass.  Seriously?  7 minutes for a glass?  My wife and I ordered the dinner for two which includes soup for each.  Lo and behold, my soup spoon had some brown stuff crusted on it.  Had to wait, wait, wait for the waitress to return.  She was no where in sight.  Not in the dining room anyway.  Didn't take as long to get a new spoon and she did apologize.

The food arrived in a reasonable time and it was good.  Soup, crab wontons, sesame chicken, sweet and sour pork.  It was decent.  But it was all delivered by food runners.

When it came time for dessert, we sat there and waited almost another 10 minutes for her to bring the dessert tray by and show us what they had.  

I think you can figured by now how long it took to get the bill and then to get the check to sign.  We got there shortly after 5 pm and didn't get out of there until 7:30!  ?????   

To sum up, food = okay.  Service = TERRIBLE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the take out here.  Very easy to order online and to pick it up. Not a hassle at all."}
{"text":"Worst place ever, over priced and kids portions for dinner.  Food was super salty and the manager just said sorry. Panda express is way better. People go else where and get your monies worth. The waitress was nice but took for ever."}
{"text":"We recently went here for a group dinner with friends.  I am unable to eat gluten and my server (Denice) was knowledgable and brought me special sauces as not to irritate my allergies.  She was amazingly accommodating and when my meal was too spicy (which was totally my fault) she got me something else.  I had the GF beef with broccoli and it was amazing.  She was personable and friendly and went beyond expectations to make sure our table enjoyed themselves.  We were there for a while and were all on separate checks.  I've been to eateries before where that was treated with great disdain.  Never once did I feel unwelcome.  I will go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite place to eat.  The food is always consistent and worth waiting for.  I have never had a bad meal here.  I crave the orange peel shrimp occasionally and have to go get my fix!  Their lettuce wraps are the best around.  I've tried them from other restaurants and they don't hold a candle to PF Chang's.  

It is very moderately priced and affordable but the ambiance of the establishment gives you the feel of a more upscale and expensive dining experience.  If you haven't been yet you have to try it!"}
{"text":"The service started out slow, but they eventually picked up the pace. We ordered the chicken/lettuce wrap appetizer, and we enjoyed it. For the entres, we had the fried rice and mongolian beef, both of which were delightful. I would not mind going back to explore their menu."}
{"text":"Somehow this one is the lesser of the PF Chang's that I have tried.  Normally PF Chang's is 5 star.  This one seems to try hard but doesn't quite reach the upper ranges than some PF Chang's I have visited.  Take out is a plus, with good take-out parking spots reserved."}
{"text":"dandan  noodle  is just so so. but service is pretty good."}
{"text":"This is the worse Chinese food I have ever had. The restaurant is beautiful, presentation of the food, and the menu itself is very nice. The server, while nice, was flaky and  kept forgetting things and mixed up the order. We will not go back."}
{"text":"This was a really great experience.
Sitting outside watching the Strip turn into nightmode while dining on exquisite asian foods.
The service was outstanding and the food just delicious.
The Edamame's were a great starter and plentiful at that. Enough for two people.
The ORANGE PEEL BEEF (Sichuan-style flank steak tossed with
a mild chili sauce and fresh orange
peel
 ) was amazing my tastebuds into oblivion. What an awesome receipe. I just wondered why it was marked as hot, since it wasn't really that spicey. The server gave me a choice of white or brown rice which is easy enough to do, but most asian restaurants don't do.
The CRAB FRIED RICE(Wok-fried ricewith lump crab meat, shiitake mushrooms, asparagus, egg, smoky bacon, 
zesty lemon and Sriracha) was a little bland. The asparagus was on the dot as were the other ingredients. The mixture made for an interesting taste, that might've been better with more spices.
The prices were at app. $15 / main dish and average at that."}
{"text":"-  Super lettuce wraps
-  Awesome quantities of great food

Four stars is because even though the food rocks, it is kind of over priced.  Also they were reluctant to make stuff vegetarian / customize anything about the food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love P.F Changs. Not this location! It was our first visit here. My boyfriend is here on a business trip and we decided to go out for a nice dinner. Well, not the best restaurant experience. It was still wonderful, since I was with his company:) Food was great and our waitress was ok. And they are the reason i'm giving it two stars. Otherwise, i'd be giving it none. Costumer service when we first walked in was HORRIBLE. We totally got ignored by the manager, who's name i believe is johnny, rudely bypassed us and decided to first sit the people behind us. He had clearly seen us. Ugh! So rude! First impressions are so important, and i was already ready to walk out seconds after walking in. But decided to still give this place another try and  waited for the real hostess to seat us, but it was still a challenge since she said we couldn't get our seating of choice, when clearly there was free tables. We had to wait until there was one \"available\" seating of our choice. Upsetting. I had lost my appetite... I think that's why we had to doggy bag most of our food. I've never had such bad experience at any restaurant like here, specially not within my first min of walking in. But, decided to stay and enjoy our dinner, inspite. Food was really good and our waitress was friendly and kept checking up on us. But, we will definitely NOT come here again. Don't expect good service here. Prepare to be ignored. Also utensils had dry gunk on them waitress had to bring replacement, no iced tea refills until we were about to pay our bill. \"Uh, no thanks\"
Oh, as we were walking out the same \"manager\" was at hostess station.  We asked for parking validation to hostess; and manager just stared, no words, while the hostess bid us good evening.

Ps. Check your doggy bag before you leave, seemed like not all my left over food was there. And they had to add something that was left out from a separate to go order.

Good luck! :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!
My wife and I went to eat there, were greeted right away, the server was cool and professional, shout out to Brandon for making us spend some quality time in a really good atmosphere. 
Keep up the great work! 
Eddie and Jamie!"}
{"text":"Service is poor and take out generally never comes out in a timely manor.  If you're looking for a meal where you can enjoy and not spend all night this is not the place you're looking for"}
{"text":"My husband and I have always loved Pf Changs but after a spectacular visit today I felt compelled to review. We frequent the Middleton location and have always had great service. We stopped in today and were seated promptly but then it seemed the servers were not notified we were there so we waited about 15 minutes before my husband went to let a server in another area know we had not been served. She immediately came right to our table to take our order and apologized profusely. She very promptly got our drinks and appetizers and apologized again. She was an excellent waitress and went the extra mile to let her manager know of our long wait. After our meal the manager came over to apologize as well and let us know that our meal would be taken care of and also left us with a $15 gift card to come back. This definitely earns a 5 star rating not to mention our meal was delicious! It came out fast and was some of the best food we have had yet! We will definitely be back soon and keep on coming! Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"In this area on business & decided to try it - no regrets.  Sat at bar solo.  Nice drink, beer, wine list including 4 \"tap\" wines.  Ordered lettuce wrap app, then seasonal special curry noodle dish.  Over-delivered and exceeded expectations for sure.  Friendly staff, great food"}
{"text":"Actually got this via room service during our one night stay at Planet Hollywood Hotel.  I have to say I was surprised at how good the food was.  We ordered the general tso's chicken, fried rice, noodles, moo shu chicken, hot & sour soup.  All of the dishes were solid.  Yeah, it's american chinese food but pretty well made. Portions were smaller then I expected but for the 6 of us, we all had more then enough food! Totally worth ordering/stopping by the restaurant in Planet Hollywood!"}
{"text":"While eating in the restaurant is always good take out and delivery is a different story.  Just ordered using door dash portions are so tiny it's a joke.  I called talked to a manager and was told everything is weighed and that's that!  Not an answer very disappointed feel like we have no food and portions are half the size."}
{"text":"I love the lettuce wraps. Service was great! Ask for Cynthia!!! She ROCKS!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here. We had dinner outside to celebrate my birthday. The waiter (Nick) was very polite and helpful. My husband didn't like the sesame chicken, and waiter changed it into another dish without any problems, so I was very pleased with the result! Thank you for the delicious food :) As always my favorite dishes were the appetizers - chicken dumplings and dynamite shrimp, but my honey chicken was great too!"}
{"text":"Great service!

Went here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and although there wasn't many people in the dining room the wait staff was fully stacked. Our waiter was very attentive to refilling glasses and checking up on us and was really nice when we split the check 4 ways."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to many PF Chang's across North America. Always take-out. The Special Fried Rice, Honey Shrimp and Sweet and Sour Soup are excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Food isn't very tasty... i tried several times for business lunches and was never delighted. This review is for vegetarian side of the menu."}
{"text":"The food is okay. Nothing to write home about. If you have a craving for Chinese food then it will do the trick otherwise go somewhere else. The prices were a bit high too. You are getting fastfood quality with restaurant prices"}
{"text":"I have gone to this location several times and the service and food have always been great. The last 2 times I have gone our silverware had dried food on it and when we asked for new silverware there was no type of apology they just asked if we would like new forks. Why would you even have to ask this? I ordered the lettuce wraps and the tasted like they had been cooked hours ago and it was very salty. I will not be returning to this location the quality of both the food and service have diminished."}
{"text":"Had a short wait on a busy night for a party of 12 with kids. Food was very good and service was fast and attentive.  Server consistently checked to see if our drinks were full and if we needed anything. We had a great time and will come again."}
{"text":"At all times the staff had a smile on. This place was truly an experience going to. The food came out in a timely manner and not at one time I had to ask for a refill."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and always a great atmosphere. The managers are awesome and the staff has always been excellent. Everyone is very attentive and I like that. Ask for Jessie - she's fantastic!!! :)"}
{"text":"Food was really good and Yuri did a decent job, I think he was a little overwhelmed having a group of 16 with no help from his team or managers. When we walked out non of the hostesses said goodbye/thank you as they were too busy talking to the servers hanging out at the hostess stand. The front entry was littered with toothpick wrappers."}
{"text":"The entire experience can be summed up in the word \"underwhelmed.\" Our waiter was courteous but passed us off to a waitress midway through our dining. The waitress brought our food and then we never saw her again.
The food was lukewarm. Not one wisp of steam to be seen. The rice was a tad \"bitey\"- either undercooked or old. We ordered the Szechwan beef and the Chang's chicken. The chicken was good but the beef was very bland. And they really skimped on the rice. Had to request more.
We ordered a California roll as an appetizer and it was just OK - not rolled well tho. It fell apart when I tried to pick it up. 
Oh and my fortune cook was dumb. That's partly a joke, but I was secretly hoping for something to laugh at but the fortune underwhelmed like everything else. 
I observed two different managers but neither came by to ask how things were.  We want at 4:15pm."}
{"text":"Today at around 4 o'clock my fiance, brother and I walked in to have some delicious food. Our server was Kris and he is by far the best server I have had coming to this location. He was very kind and approached us in a kind manner. He constantly was checking in on us to ensure we were doing fine. You need more people like Kris to keep the 5 stars coming in! Great job!"}
{"text":"Always good and consistent. Shrimp with lobster sauce is my favorite as are the lettuce wraps, ribs, and chocolate cake. share the cake though because portion is insanely big, I wish they would offer smaller dessert portions for cheaper price. It's also much healthier to do that. For this reason they get 4 stars. Otherwise there are many healthy options eg. Brown rice, less oil if you ask, gluten free if that's your thing etc. the grilled salmon is also amazing. I had one issue in all the times I've eaten here (rice not fully cooked so it was crunchy) and they completely apologized, made a new meal(I didn't pay for it) and offered us dessert. That is customer service! If you've not been here try it. They have traditional meals and some with a twist."}
{"text":"So, I went to this P.F Chang's for my birthday dinner this past Saturday with a group of seven people, including myself. I've been to a couple of different P.F Chang's around the valley and I always have a pretty good time. This time...not so good. 

Our reservation was for 8:00p and I'm not going to lie, I am notorious for being late. By some birthday miracle, I made it to the place about two minutes after 8. I know, late is late, but when my boyfriend made the reservation they told him that ours would be given away if we were 10-15 minutes late...a little confusing, but whatever. We got our table just fine. Food and drinks were good as well. 

Our waitress was nice, but she seemed aloof - which is not something I would hold against someone. What I did have a problem with is her whisking my food away that was barely touched. We were sitting in a U-shaped booth and I was turned to face the group to talk. I wasn't watching over my food(I didn't think I had to) and I had a couple of drinks, so I was definitely very into whatever I was talking about. I could understand that maybe she didn't want to interrupt me...personally, I would have preferred her doing that instead of just taking the food away without checking. My other friends weren't talking, so she could have asked them about it and they would have asked me. We spent $200 that night. That's a fortune to me and to leave with no leftovers when there was plenty....well, I consider THAT a dinner time atrocity. I know I should have said something then, but everyone was leaving so I didn't. I really should have because it's been bothering me! 9/10 times, I always eat my leftovers the next day. Wasting food is a huge pet peeve of mine...and in this situation it severely irks me because it was food that I was going to eat. Maybe a good solution would be to re-train that server and make sure all of the servers are on the same page.

A warning to all who choose to dine at P.F Chang's in Planet Hollywood: Make sure to keep a steady eye on your meal if you are like me and want to get the most for your money by taking the leftovers home."}
{"text":"We were utterly disappointed by the quality and taste of food. No flavor and over cooked. We had to return our chicken dish because it was completely dry. The replacement was not good also.  
This restaurant has great ambiance\" waiter was very friendly and courteous. My two stars are for that.  However, food is tasteless.  They need to change the chef. Chicken pad Thai and lettuce wrap had no taste.  We ordered cashew chicken\". It was full of cashews, but they were uncooked."}
{"text":"I ordered a catering delivery order for an office and was so pleased with the service provided by this location. The lady who delivered was so knowledgeable and had been with them for 11 years giving way above expected the quality of service. I love the rewards program and have now earned 3 free entrees and will continue to cater with them!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times, so know what to expect with the food-usually consistent food.  Nothing out of this world, but well prepared and seasoned.

Tonight I decided to do the curbside pickup, and only ordered 2 cold appetizers and calamari.  I did the order online at 5:15, was told to pick up at 6pm.  I arrived at 6, called and let them know I was there.  At 6:15, and no sign of anybody, I called again and told the person I was STILL waiting.  After sitting for another 12 minutes, the server finally arrived at my car, unaware that I had been sitting there for almost 30 minutes (lack of communication somewhere?).

I can understand that it is a Saturday night and it was likely busy, and so don't mind waiting if the food is good.  However, when I got home (I live approx 3 minutes away), I opened the calamari and it was cold and rubber, as if it had been left sitting for too long.  

Very disappointing to have to wait almost 30 minutes for cold food.  With all of the good restaurants around this location, it'll definitely be a long while before I order from here again-unacceptable!!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Went for dinner and ordered vegetarian lettuce wraps - came with 4 pieces of lettuce. Then the main of Buddhas feast looked like a bag of frozen veges with some soft tofu in it. The vege was not prepared correctly and the beans had all the \"stringy\" bits left on. Was disgusting. The service was very poor and we sat while rubbish bins got wheeled by and the tables got set up for the following day. The waitress was inattentive and most of the staff too busy chatting to one another to worry about customers. When we came to leave we had to go to the counter and wait for about 10mins for someone to come take our payment  after about 4 people asking us if we were ok. Always loved this place but won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was very good (but not inspiring).

We did the 2 for $40 meal where you receive the shared appetizer (vegetarian lettuce wraps 5/5), 2 entrees (Mongolian beef and shrimp 5/5), and super tiny (but very delicious desserts--3/5 for the small size). I had a bubble tea alcohol drink and that was very good as well.

The portions are generous, and we had leftovers from each part of the meal.

If you go out on a nice day or on weekends, make sure you have a reservation. The wait time on Sunday at 7pm was 1 hour and 45 minutes."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas this past weekend for my cousin's Bachelorette Party and to thank us for coming, she treated us out to dinner at PF Chang's inside the Planet Hollywood. I already like PF Chang's to begin with, especially their sea bass (yum!!!), but I have to commend the staff at this location. They were all friendly and nice, especially the main guy helping us. Unfortunately, I don't remember his name (c'mon I was in Vegas! probably wasted already)--asian guy with glasses. And because, it took longer for them to seat us even with our reservation, they made it up us by comping us a couple of appetizers--chicken wraps! All in all, it was a great experience at the restaurant and a nice way to start the evening of debauchery!"}
{"text":"Excellent service - good food.  Although some of our Asian friends don't consider this chain to be authentic food - it is always a nice experience.  Good place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Usually this is a decent pf changs location. Tonight my dish taste nothing like it usually does, I'm not sure if the food is ruined or if they made it totally wrong. Not even edible. I got take out, otherwise I would for sure be sending it back. Not to mention quite a wait for my takeout after the pick up time."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to try something different. I don't often eat at a chinese restaurant, even though this is surely an americanized version I wanted to give it a try. I was here visiting from out of town and they had plenty of these locations all over the US so I was familiar with the name. 
Wow was this placed packed! It didn't seem like a rush hour of the day but this place nearly had every table occupied. I had to wait a short while for a table to be ready but that was understandable. The restaurant already smelled great from all the delicious food so I was eagerly waiting to be seated. 
Once I sat down I was greeted by our friendly waiter who explained to me most of the popular dishes since this was my first time there. I decided on the honey seared chicken with rice and enjoyed a bowl of soup before the meal was brought out. 
When we were served our meal, the presentation was great. The food tasted great as well. The chicken was cooked perfect, the outside has a nice crunch with a tender inside. The honey seared chicken sauce tasted great as well! 
The only thing was that we wanted more refills with our drinks but the waiter didn't come back to our table very often after the meal was served to us. Not much of a gripe but the over all experience was very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Dan Dan chicken noodles is superb. Very good ambience too. But very less space to move as the tables are really close to each other."}
{"text":"Completely unimpressive in every way, except for its most excellent atmosphere, Which is fine, if it weren't on the pricey side. (I am not opposed to more expensive meals, I just like to feel I get my moneys worth.)

To justify my two star rating though, I have to say this, I should not be comparing a very nice looking, hip, somewhat pricey restaurant with Chins, The second I compare it to chins (The equivalent of fast food Chinese) it has already lost, the second I compare it to chins Unfavorably, It gets two stars, Considering a trip here costs about 7 dollars more per plate.

Pros;
Great atmosphere, if a bit dark, great decorations, spotless stainless steel kitchen visible from the dining area, which creates enough background noise to feel your conversation is private.

Very good rice, fresh, fluffy, exactly what rice should be.

A very fresh tasting Americanized Chinese food.

Cons:

Too dark, sometimes I had difficulty seeing around with a spot in my eyes.

The quality of the food was on par if not sub par to Chins, with the exception of the rice. One of our dishes was distinctly lacking any pronounced flavor, in the chicken or the sauce.

This was not made up for with large portions, The quantity of food was less than Chins would give you for nearly half the price. (And I don't know about you, but part of Chinese food is having enough for late night Chinese munchies, When my girlfriend finishes her plate, I know it's not enough)

Pricey, to the point that you feel half of your bill was for the atmosphere.

In conclusion. It would probably be a nice place to take a first date, Upscale nice looking place, dark, and enough food if you are eating on a nervous stomach, but if you are going to a restaurant's for the food's sake and not the track lighting and dark hardwood, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Found a Screw in my Rice, 
Way to go on killing me. Luckily it was right on TOP and I couldnt miss it, although the waiter could. 
When I pointed it out to the waiter he just said \"sorry\" and left. 
Came back with a larger bowl of rice...... when I was done eating... 
That really made up for it? 
NOT! 

However when I told my friends about this, one of my friends said the same thing happend to her dad at the Keirlands PF Chang location. Her dad had the metal sponge peice in his food... Thats absolutely discusting!"}
{"text":"What has happened to the Mesa PF Changs you guys used to be great on your game and the food was great I say was ! I just tryed agin Saturday afternoon Aug 25 2013 the service awful had to wait just for someone to take an order the mananger took the order! after tweny minutes then the server was slow pleasant but slow the food last comment was again marginal after three visits giving you another try I'm done sorry we all have options for our resturant dollar and it's not here anymore upper management needs to review this branch. Thank You"}
{"text":"Bogus forced wait for 30 min.  15 empty tables but scam delay and \"recommendation\" to wait in bar. Nice effort to drive the revenue up.

Not cool guys.  Suddenly table became available 5 minutes after NOT going to the bar. 

Food and service good overall. Just not happy with hostess."}
{"text":"Upon walking in, I smiled and said hello to the hostess, and she just blankly stared at me. I had a brief flashback to my time spent hosting, and I felt as if our roles had been reversed.

But, I digress.
Our server, Taylor, was very sweet and helpful with explaining our sauces, and even checked with the cooks to see if I could get spring rolls without the duck (which, sadly was not possible).
Their vegetarian options were decent and clearly labeled. Food was good. Ginger beer tasted like bar sweet and sour mix.

I might come back."}
{"text":"Never had bad service or food, great atmosphere! A little pricey but we'll worth it. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Can not handle a lot of people, friendly staff. It took a while to get just our drinks. The entree came before the appitzers"}
{"text":"Great food, great service as always. 
The Changs Spicy Chicken was awesome, and the Crispy Honey Shrimp was the same. 
George did great until he forgot our fortune cookies.  :-( 
But he redeemed himself :-)"}
{"text":"I have never been to P.F. Chang's before. Today was my best friends birthday and her boyfriend calls me 20 minutes before they leave to go have her bday dinner at this location and tells me he's planning on proposing to her. So I google the number real quick and a guy named Marcus answers and I tell him how they're coming in for her bday dinner but he's got a fortune cookie with the inside message saying will you marry me and I want to secretly come in so I can record it. Marcus took down my phone number, told me not to worry and called me after he seated them and then went on to tell me how he pulled the shade down on their booth so she wouldn't see me pull in, had me and my 3 year old wait where she wouldn't see us and offered us drinks, actually came out of the restaurant and got the fortune cookie from me so the server could deliver it to my best friend, told me when it was being delivered to her table, and also notified me when she was getting up to use the restroom in case my son decided to peek over and get us seen. The most amazing customer service I have EVER experienced in Las Vegas. He went above and beyond and then some on his own free will. Marcus, if you ever see this you are amazing and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for making my best friends engagement memorable!!!  If I ever decide to eat Chinese food I will come here but I will make sure to call and see if he's working he was just absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian, and I can vouch for the fact that I had great vegetarian fried rice and coconut curry at this place. I loved their ginger ale and the service by a waiter named Nick. Has a nice upbeat ambiance and a full bar. Right next to Planet Hollywood, half-price tickets outlet and the Miracle Shop malls."}
{"text":"One of the best PF Chang's I've ever eaten at. Great, friendly & attentive service. Garlic noodles were awesome. The ma po tofu was a little too salty but great with rice. The chicken lettuce wraps were off the chain! Hot and sour soup was so-so; not bad.

If you don't want to wait on any given night, make reservations. I made reservations and even with that, I had to wait about 10 minutes before getting seated. 

I have to tell you though, one night we were here and a customer broke, yes BROKE, their glass door entrance to the PH casino. We were in the middle of eating on the upper level and heard glass shattering everywhere. Didn't know what the story was; maybe there was a fight, or maybe he was doing a dine-and-dash? I don't know. But we came here again a couple nights later and found that the glass door was gone, so there was no blockage from the casino into the restaurant. Haha."}
{"text":"Love Pf changs. It's a cool place for a quick lunch with friend's. Service is usually pretty good and food is always good. Not your authentic Chinese food, very Americanized but i always enjoy it here. I love the location since I live in summerlin. Haven't tried anything I didn't like or love"}
{"text":"Great food and service away from the crowds on the strip. Everything we ordered was great and well prepared. Enjoyed drinks and an great meal in this relaxed atmosphere with plenty of parking if your driving over. Yes it's a chain but this location is well run and worth a stop."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some takeout last night. Most usually get good food from Changes, however, it is pricey. Never been so disappointed house special fried rice, Mongolian beef and kung pao chicken. All was gross. The chicken was dry no sauce and close to being burned.  The beef tough and very little for the price. Rice was flavorless. I felt as though I had thrown 50.00 out the window. Very disappointed again"}
{"text":"Ordered The Kung Pao chicken and it was unlike any kung pao i have had in scores of Chinese restaurants. There was no sauce or vegetables, just rather dry pieces of chicken put on a bed of rice along with a overly generous amount of peanuts which only added to the dryness. Told the waitress and her response was \"the kung pao is cooked in sauce but not served in the sauce\"  Hot sour soup was very good and the service good but stay away from the kung poa unless you have had it here before. Drink prices for ice tea are rather high."}
{"text":"Great chain restaurant. Love their special 3 course menu for 2. Plenty of food for two meals for each of us."}
{"text":"I had a worm in my edamame. Other then that service and meal was fantastic. Love the lettuce wraps!!"}
{"text":"The food was great as usual however I felt like the portions were smaller and the prices went up. Food is still a five star but with the smaller portion size I felt a three star was earned. I'll go back again, maybe it was just bad luck with the portions. If so I'll change my rating."}
{"text":"A billion Chinese eat rice everyday.....you'd think a restaurant that boasts being a Chinese Bistro would have figured out by now.....how to cook rice....but this one hasn't.....sent back the raw rice and got a fresh 'n hot bowl of raw rice the second time too....whoever was working the pass tonight definitely needs to work on quality control and needs a new pair of glasses, you could see the bright white raw grains in each bowl...Panda Express was sending out better rice tonight....service was great and all of our other dishes were fine....but to serve raw, the simplest staple of Chinese cuisine....epic fail....."}
{"text":"The Scottsdale location was able to seat us ( a party of 5) quickly and we tried a variety of items.

The food has never impressed me much, especially the lettuce wraps-everyone raves about. The actual \"meat\" that you put in the iceberg shells is sketchy, what is in there? Chicken mixed with tofu and chewy bits??

I go with others and enjoy the wonderful service and beautiful atmosphere of the restaurants.

That being said....I wouldn't make the shrimp with candied walnuts and honeydew melon at home and I admit it is great tasting!"}
{"text":"Cons:
Expensive (your paying for the ambiance)
Small servings of rice with entrees

Pros:
Fast service  
Fresh hot food
Comfortable seating
Low music 
Beautiful building and lighting

I'm not usually a huge fan of PF Changs food if I compare it to other Asian resteruants but what it does it does it well and we really enjoyed it this time.

We ordered:
Crispy green beans
Lettuce wraps
Sweet and sour soup as well as egg drop
Mongolian beef
Spicy chicken
Singapore street noodles,
Brown rice
Vanilla wontons
Chocolate flourless cake (you will NOT be able to eat this alone- wonderfully rich)"}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner, the waiter suggested the Mongolian Beef and my ordered a chicken. Food was very good as was the waiter."}
{"text":"(Friday 12/29/2017 at 6:20pm) As someone who works in the service industry, I am always aware of how much more successful you can be when you smile! Well, P.F. Chang's failed horribly as soon as we walked in the door. The hostess (female, blonde hair, white sweater) DID NOT SMILE. She didn't even say \"Hello, welcome to PF Chang's!\" If I did not have a gift card for the dinner, we would have turned around and left. Our server \"Burooj\" was very pleasant, always smiled and was very accommodating. She saved our dining experience. The cocktails were fine, and the meal was adequate. I'll have to give it some serious thought as to whether we go to P.F. Chang's again."}
{"text":"Never do this, but it needed to be done. To start with, they lost our reservation. Once that was settled and we got to our table, the initial drink service was quick, but don't hope for another anytime soon. By the time, an hour after we ordered it, our food came, it was at most lukewarm, but everyone just wanted to eat and get out. I have had better tasting delivery Asian food for a much better price.   This was a very unappealing experience, and not worth the hype. 

Given the chance I would give this no stars, but because you have to give something to leave a review, I give it one."}
{"text":"Came here as a party of 4 on Christmas Eve - we had a reservation, but the place was jammed packed so I was unsure of the wait, despite having a reservation. We checked in and were taken immediately to a table. Our server was excellent, we never had an empty class. The food was wonderful, not a long wait for it to come out and just an overall great experience. 5 stars for excellent customer service and tasty food!"}
{"text":"My first time to eat here.  They knocked it out of the ballpark, great service, great food.    Always happy when I find a lace that can cook great calamari, also the meat in pepper steak was very tender.  As was the meat in the Mongolian beef.   Definitely will go back, superb, thanks!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a disappointment! We went in for lunch today, and was immediately assailed with the smell of rancid, burnt, cooking oil. It was disgusting. We should have left, but we were really hungry and not in the mood for looking for another restaurant.  I ordered the chicken with cashews and almonds and it was, at best, fair. I am absolutely positive that the food was prepared from frozen, with the exception of fresh bell peppers and celery. Everything else in the dish was undoubtedly frozen. The chicken, nuts, onions, and sauce were absolutely impregnated complete with the flavor of cheap, canned bamboo shoots. Truth is that I've had canned Chinese food that tasted exactly the same. I am a very good cook, and I am married to a Chinese-American and I know how to cook good Chinese food.  This was awful, and definitely NOT worth the ridiculous price. I won't even begin to discuss the issues with my husband's pepper steak, other than saying that it was also cooked from frozen and seasoned terribly. We are never returning."}
{"text":"The food and service are good; however they don't have the Lemon Pepper Shrimp appetizer anymore."}
{"text":"I never give bad reviews but this location was the worst! My food came out wrong 3 times, our server literally ignored us, and we we were there for over 90 minutes over the whole meal! The server's name was Alex and we could tell he was staying away from our table so we wouldn't complain. 

I don't eat at PF Chang's ever, but I am pregnant and was craving it, and it totally disappointed. I am also disappointed that Alex didn't get a manager involved and gave us even worse service because he's a wimp and was trying to avoid us. 

After the 3rd attempt, I just got my food to go and left. I never saw a manager in our section once (over 90 minutes, that's alarming) so I figured it was pointless to bring this to their attention. 

I will NEVER go back to this location, words don't do their horrible service justice, but trust me Alex and the PM management staff sucks. Boo."}
{"text":"Service was great at this location. We came at the perfect time and never waited for a table. I used to love it when you could make your own sauces tableside. I don't know how long ago they took them away. The fried green beans could have used a dash of salt. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I was here on a Friday at about 4pm. The food was great... but the service... WAS ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT!! I never had to ask for a refill, our server was informative and helpful and his use of teamwork with the other servers/food runners was awesome. This business focuses on quality and customer service above all else. I'm glad to have found this Gem. Kudos to the management. Having an awesome staff is a reflection of your leadership. ***Shawn was the name of our server***"}
{"text":"So sad. Service great. Female line cook on 9/19/2016 around 5pm chewing gum while cooking.  Seriously smacking the crap out of her gum. How much of her spit was in the food she flipped around. Obviously no real chefs on site or managers who have been in the F&B business long enough to correct or fire that behavior.  Disgusting. Anyone who is serious about this business and cares about the customers and service  knows that gum and cooks and servers DO NOT MIX.  And I use the word cooks not the title Chef because there is not a Chef I know who would allow this in their kitchen.   

Shame on PF Changs."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and sat at the bar.  I ordered the seemed shrimp dumplings and the chicken with black bean sauce.  Both were amazing!  The staff was nice and the service was really good."}
{"text":"Worse service of PF Chang's...staying at the Westin and came here twice or should I say once - food took forever and never showed on second time - first time took forever and had to keep asking waitress to check on it...

This place needs a management attitude overhaul...the hostesses are as non-responsive as the management.  When brought to attention of manager he said \"I have got your food covered\" well that didn't make up for the hour and half of our life we won't get back, need less to say - our food comped when we didn't even get to eat it....

With all the food choices in the Commons go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service! Server was delayed taking care of a large party so the manager came over and offered to comp us an appetizer for the delay. The server came over shortly and was extremely apologetic about the delay, which wasn't even much of an issue, had it of not been brought to our attention. However, the fact that the issue was addressed, without us needing us to address it ourselves was superb! Great job PF Changs Madison. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This rating is more for the service and attitude than the food.  Started off by hearing our waitress complain that she only made $150 last night.  My opinion, if you have a complaint like that, don't let your customers hear it.  Service after that was OK, nothing special. Food, as always very enjoyable.  I do agree with previous raters, it seems like something small having the sauce made up at the table, but I know I miss it also."}
{"text":"Love PF Chang .... from their wonderful menu selections, including gluten free menu, to their wonderful and accommodating staff!!"}
{"text":"Pretty Tasty!!  I loved it!  A little on the pricey side, but overall we enjoyed it.  We had a nice evening, nice atmosphere, looks kinda slow for them perfect for us :D.  awesome waiter \"David\", good service answering all our questions .
 The food was full of taste, and  I definitely will come back soon!  We put in a good word for the restaraunt, and the waiter.
That definitely makes a big difference!  Way to go
Its funny how people gives 1 star just because \"ohh i think my soup is not the same today \" ....    Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Always love PF Changs,  they do not have it on the menu anymore but they can still make the double pan fried noodles.  I strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have given P.F. Chang's 4 chances.  All 4 times we ate here were a disappointment. It took them 45minutes to seat us, another 45minutes for the food and every dish was loaded with salt. We ordered 1 app, 1 soup and 2 entrees and every dish was salty to the point where it was really not edible. We could even taste the saltiness on a spicy dish, super salty. We ended up leaving with a hungry stomach. Does the chef not taste the food before it goes out? Honestly, some of the small Chinese takeout places are so much better than P.F. Chang's. I don't understand how could people eat at this place. Do they not have any taste buds? Or does their regular customers just love salt in general? Eating here is like putting a spoonful of salt in your mouth. I will never eat here again. I have given them enough chances. If I could give them negative ratings I would have."}
{"text":"I had the grilled wild sea bass on a bed of fresh spinach with a glaze. I have never had a more perfectly cooked piece of fish. It was fabulous."}
{"text":"Simply amazing food. I go here often with family and friends. Prices are decent and you can order appetizer and entree without breaking the bank. You might want to set a reservation at this location on the weekends because it is always crowded. I also have the P.F. Chang Warrior Card of which if you can get 10% off your meal. Sign up if you are a regular like me and use it!

Appetizers: Shrimp Dumplings, Crab Wontons, and the Dynamite Shrimp are my favs. 
Dinner Entrees: Shrimp Fried Rice, Beef with Broccoli, Sesame Chicken, Crispy Honey Chicken, Orange Peel Shrimp, Lo Mein Combo are my favs.

The quality of the food is good and I have never had a problem with the service as well."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant chain by far. I came here for a birthday/fathers day celebration. The food was so delicious, just as I always count on it being. Service was spot on, the manager even stopped by and was so kind. 

I won't give my usually lengthy details because people know what to expect here. I just wanted to say this location is killing it. 

Don't miss the crispy green beans if you haven't tried them before. The sauce is sooooo good."}
{"text":"Ah, the agony of disappointment.  I take back what I said previously about P.F. Changs Food.  The menu has changed yet again in the past 6 mos. or so.  Gone
are some of the more unique items: Lamb, Brussel Sprouts... and more.  Most of the sauces taste like they came out of a bottle and it has lost its' charm.  And pray tell, what is going on with the little tomatoes in almost every dish?  Yuck, you can not add the same tomato medley salad concoction to most every item and think that people will not notice.

Also, so many new faces working at the restaurant.  Why is this?  New managers, new waiters, new bartenders.  And a new bland and corporate menu.  

What happened to the Stella Artois on tap?"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and had a decent meal.  While the Mongolian Beef was beyond excellent, the Moo Goo Gai Pan was average (although I did enjoy the shrimp in it).  Service was fine and decor is pleasant.  For some reason I'm just not in the mood to write a detailed review - please accept my apologies."}
{"text":"Decent/friendly service.  Slow kitchen (on a slow night with less than 1/4 filled).  Uneven food preparation.

While the food could be very good, the place has very uneven quality in every aspect of the restaurant.  We had a large dinner (over 5 people and over $250 in total bill), and here's our impression.

1) Food - Appetizers were very good, Chicken Lettuce Wrap, great as usual.  Lobster/Shrimp Taco excellent.  Sushi was lackluster across the board, almost not worth ordering - you might get better ones off a buffet assembly line.  The soups were uneven - Wonton soup excellent.  Hot n Sour soup is dense and salty, and again, worse than a standard $5 Chinese restaurant buffet line.  Main Entree is uneven as well - not particularly flavorful.  The new entrees are hit and miss.  Lamb is good and tender, though tasted nothing like lamb (just beef-flavor, the sauce is very heavy).  But the Chilean Sea Bass (Hong Kong style), one of the most expensive item on the menu, is severely undercooked - we should have sent it back but did not (our fault).  This is how under-cooked it is - we tried to cut it with a knife, and cannot because the middle was NOT cooked.  And Sea Bass is so flaky and it's supposed to fall apart at the touch of a fork.

2) Service - Server is friendly, and accommodating to different requests.  Fresh plates are brought during change of courses.  On the other hand, the restaurant, though encouraging \"family style\" serving, does not quite know how to serve food in family style.  There are extended wait time between appetizer, to soup, to sushi, to entrees.  Family style would require items to be brought up as each is ready, rather than having guests wait for extended time and then have everything arrive at the same time.  For a place that was less than 1/4 seated, there was far too much wait time (20 min) between appetizer and just soup, and again extended wait between sushi and hot entrees.  By the time the main courses arrived, it was almost anti-climatic and people were pretty much full/tired.  It was not clear whose job it was to clear off the \"empty\" plates when food is eaten, a number of times it was piled up on the corners of a small table - again, at far cheaper buffet lines, these plates would have been cleared much, much sooner.

Over the last decade, our P.F. Chang experience have gone from excitement to just a periodic visit with out-of-town guests - and the uneven food and service experience is not likely to encourage many re-visits."}
{"text":"I've been to PF Chang's many times, but this was the first seeking gluten free items. I was surprised and happy to find a pretty extensive gluten free menu. But,,,, the items on the gluten free menu are at least $1 more than their same counterparts on the regular menu. I guess that gluten free soy sauce is more expensive?! Please. I had the Singapore street noodle dish. It was okay, but had very little chicken and shrimp in it, and was mainly rice noodles with some cherry tomatoes. The best thing about the gluten free menu was the GF Flourless Chocolate Dome- it was an amazing chocolate dessert, despite the $5.95 price tag. It was well presented with berries, a mint sprig and the oh so pretty drizzles on the plate. It melted in your mouth with a creamy chocolate center. I split it with another person; even though it was small, it was enough for two. Go for dessert!"}
{"text":"Dinner for 2 is the way to go :-)

I think of PF Chang's as a safe but not too adventurous choice.  Always had good food and good service."}
{"text":"Normally I don't review chain restaurants, but all the negative reviews inspired me to speak up. The service was excellent, the food was exactly what you would expect and want, and the whole experience was great. 

I'd never been to a PF Chang's before, and based on all these reviews I almost didn't go this time. But it was awesome! No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Good food but I don't prefer PF for a takeout option. Would much rather eat at the restaurant but I guess that's the case with most esrablishments."}
{"text":"We stop in here for happy hour regularly. James is hands down the most efficient bartender I've ever watched in action. He moves at the speed of five people. All of the staff we've ever interacted with are friendly and attentive (to be fair, we've only interacted with staff who work in the bar because we never sit in the restaurant). They don't judge me when I order 2-3 desserts in lieu of dinner. :) Joe (one of the managers) is funny, friendly, and makes it a point to get to know your name if you go in regularly. 
Their happy hour menu is GREAT, the food is delicious, the wine (Colby red) tastes good, and I love the coupons they email me."}
{"text":"A big disappointment.  I ordered the coconut curried vegetables and my husband ordered Buddha's feast.  Both dishes come with tofu.  The tofu was nowhere in sight.  Buddha's feast had a few tiny little slivers of tofu and the curry had a few chunks.  Usually tofu is the main ingredient with the vegetables.  I think this place is a bunch of hype.  Walk into any Chinese restaurant in NYC and when you order a dish with tofu there is a lot of tofu.  We were shocked.  If you are looking for tofu \"forgedabouddit\""}
{"text":"The food is packed with sodium.  Very salty.  I think it must be pre=prepared - not fresh."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner one day and was very satisfied after my dinner.
The food was delicious. 
I enjoyed it some much I bought lunch there the following day.
The is now one of my best places to eat.
I would recommend P.F. Chang's China Bistro to everyone."}
{"text":"Was there sunday early evening. Not that crowded yet. Service was prompt and friendly. After 30 mins from ordering, our entrees were not ready yet...or even close to being ready. Then two customers started into an aggressive argument. Very loud and vulgar. They were yelling and dropping f bombs. It could of very easily progressed to pbysical violence. The staff did nothing to control the situation. Maybe they did after i left. I dont know...I paid  for my drinks and left during the middle of this argument... never again"}
{"text":"They should change the name, they changed everything else. I will never step foot in any P.F. Chang's again. I used to eat there at least once a month for at least 15 years but never again. I tried it a few times more to see if I could find something that I could stand to eat without wanting to spit it out in to my napkin with no success, even the lettuce wraps and dumplings were just awful. So I guess what I have to say is if you liked the great food at P.F. Chang's you are out of luck it has gone the way of the Dodo bird. I wish I could give it minus stars and it would be - 10. Sure do miss the awesome food they built their reputation on."}
{"text":"Expensive and overcooked... Place was empty and cooking time was quite long. With all the choices in Vegas this was the wrong one"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE coming here! We have never came here and have been disappointed. Service is always on point as well as the food! I love the environment as well! The two person dinner for $40 is what we always get! It's such a good deal which includes 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and dessert! I never even finish my meal because the banana spring rolls are so worth saving room for! I give this restaurant a full 5 stars!=]"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place, we usually go to the location at Kierland but tonight we branched out, and boy were we sorry. 

When we arrived, the restaurant was all but empty, but it still took the host a few to make it to the front to seat us (it was no biggie at the time, but in retrospect, it should have been our first clue). When we were sat it took a while before our server a while to come and take our drink order. He was talkative, vibrant, and wayyyyyy too creative, and spent almost ten minutes talking to another table after we ordered before bringing our waters. It took almost 15 more to get our bar drinks (a beer and a cocktail). We ordered the Changs for two, with this you get a soup, an appetizer and two entrees. Each course took what felt like forever to come out. The appetizers and salad were tasty, but our entrees were a disaster. 

Right before our entrees came out, our server (the creative one) came to our table and told my boyfriend \"I made the executive decision to order your Mongolian beef the way I like it best.\" Um..... In what world is it ok to order your favorite for someone else without asking the guest before you order it????????? Not only did my boyfriend HATE it, but his noodles never came, my pad Thai also came without sauce (another executive decision?). By this time we had been in the restaurant for 2 hours, so my boyfriend choked his meal down, and by the time my sauce came my noodles were cold. My food smelled and tasted like a wet dog. Literally. 

A manager came by to check on us, and despite not wanting to complain, I asked him to take the soaking mutt disguised as pad Thai away and replace it. He told me he agrees with me and that they put too much fish sauce on the dish now, and he hates when people order it.... Um... Ok?? I ended up complaining about the \"executive decisions\", the timing and the wrong orders. He offered to make me something to go and I agreed and ordered the ginger chicken with noodles instead of rice, he also offered to take care of or check. I told him that our bar drinks were awesome and offered to pay for them. He said, verbatim, \"ok, you buy your drinks, I'll take care of the rest\". We were in no way trying for a free meal, but when a manager offers, they should deliver. 

When the check came, we just gave a card to the creative waiter believing that we were only paying for our beverages. When the check came back, the manager had not obliged to his own promise and charged us for half of our food and we had already paid!!!!!!! 


When I got home, I began to eat my ginger chicken with noodles and that order, again, was wrong.  




Unless you're only going to drink, this location is a waste of time, patience, and money and with so many other options at lower price points, there are many, cheaper options."}
{"text":"RAW PORK DUMPLINGS @ LUNCH:  So this wasn't a case that the pork was undercooked.  It was bloody raw - I had a to-go order for lunch and was eating while typing on the computer.  I didn't realize until after I ate a few that they were raw.  There is never an excuse for raw Pork or Chicken to leave a kitchen.  Disappointed and Disgusted."}
{"text":"My family (wife, kids, and parents) and I have never been to P F Chang's and decided to try it out since most of our friends like it.  We really like Chinese food in San Francisco CA, but I decided to come without super high expectations.

Why the 2 stars?  It's a combination of reasons.  Even though I did not walk in with super high expectations there is still a certain par level for a restaurant that prices Chinese food that high and claims to \"create great, crave-able Chinese food that guests cannot get anywhere else.\"  What a claim!  So I guess you can say that I did have a level of expectation based on their own claim.  

I ordered the shrimp with candied walnuts lunch plate with fried rice.   The flavor was really nothing extraordinary, it was rather bland.  The sauce was tangy and the melons sweet but the shrimp had no savor.  The shrimp was also chewy.  The fried rice was, how do you put it, fried rice.  The hot and sour soup, on the other hand, had great flavor.  It had just the right amount of sour and spiciness to it. 

The rest of my family didn't have anything wonderful to say about their lunch dishes.  My wife had the Chang's spice chicken and my parents shared the wonton soup and Chang's chicken lettuce wraps.  The kids didn't complain about their dishes and they rarely rave about food anyways, so their reactions did not contribute to the rating in this review.  However the kids' food, and sauce that came with it, came out piping hot (it was too hot to handle with even our fingers).  My wife and I had to blow on their food for several minutes so that the temperature was palatable to their young sensitive mouths.  Mind you that we understand that food comes out hot at every restaurant but this time it seemed like the food was taken straight out of the fryer and sent directly to our kids. This event DID contribute to the rating in this review.  

The service was ok... nothing great and nothing bad.

In conclusion, PF Chang's China Bistro did not create great, crave-able Chinese food that guests cannot get anywhere else.  They certainly did not create it with my shrimp dish nor the dishes that the rest of my family had.  This experience certainly does not scream \"lets go there again!\"  I often have a craving for Chinese food from a few other smaller restaurants in Henderson.  On top of that, they are inexpensive compared to PF Chang's.  We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, good prices, good service. The best part was that we were seated on the second level next to the windows with an incredible view. That is what made the visit so perfect. This was my first visit to a P.F. Chang's and I would definitely visit again no matter where I was. In a city full of overpriced food it was refreshing to get a good meal at a good price with a great experience."}
{"text":"Walked in tonight, Wednesday, at 9:50, the place was empty. Asked for a table, the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us, then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it!  The phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door. When she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again!!  Didn't say a word to us. Unbelievable!  Will not be back there-- rude hostess!"}
{"text":"When we entered the restaurant, the waitresses and waiters greeted us warmly, its decoration reflects Chinese culture, and especially two horses made of stone give me strongly feeling that it's a kind of Chinese traditional decoration. Then I saw the traditional Chinese wallpaper hanging on the wall. That aroused my homesick feeling. After we had sat down, a waitress came and handed us the menu. Looking at the menu, I found the price was higher than I expected. So we only ordered one typical Sichuan dishes, \"spicy fried chicken with peanut\" (Kung-Pao Chicken) . The moment the dish served at the table we did not hesitate to enjoy it. Oh, my God, what a Sichuan dish, I have never eaten such Sichuan dishes which were far from what I expected. I cannot find the familiar feeling that stimulates my tongue strongly. Basing on my knowledge and experience I had in China, I came to a conclusion that it is not authentic. As far as color, scent, taste and design are concerned, the dishes in this restaurant is not qualified, not to speak of Sichuan dish features characterized with hot, spicy and sour. I felt very disappointed."}
{"text":"Good ambiance. Great location. The food was not that outstanding. I mean I loved the chicken lettuce thing. They don't really know what spicy means. They have chicken spicy listed in the entrée which is sweet."}
{"text":"Don't trust them for delivery/take-out. 90 minutes after placing order, manager says they're too busy to fill take-out order. If you're busy, okay, but then don't take the order -- don't place it and keep us waiting for 90 minutes. And if you take an order and keep it waiting for 90 minutes, the recourse is a comp'd meal, not a decision to not fulfill the order at all. Seriously management training is in order..."}
{"text":"It is adequate sometimes bordering on authentic food. A bit over-salted in all dishes, and the cooking is sketchy.
Have been here four different times. 
Dumplings are worth it - and won't disappoint.
Noodles can be cooked perfectly - or not- but if you ask management they will correct it for you.  
Service depends upon the waiter- some are great and attentive and some appear a bit over-matched by the service. 
It is a worthwhile place to stop by for a lunch, not a special place for an occasion."}
{"text":"Bland food but after it is made they discovered salt and drench the food so they have managed to achieve bland and over salted. Hard to do. 

Get the sushi - they don't have to cook that , although if you want good sushi there are other places. 

The quality has progressively declined and now their flagship is a sinking dingy. 

Do yourself a favor - don't eat here"}
{"text":"Front desk personnel bright and attentive, as was our server. Service is always good, as is the food. Tried to try some new things other than standard Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Pad Thai, which is always excellent. Had Kung Pao Chicken and my wife had Chicken and Spicy Eggplant, which was better than my Chicken. Overall, pretty good and always quality experience you can depend on."}
{"text":"The manager on staff today was very considerate! I had unknowingly dropped my jacket outside between lunch and getting in cab to head to airport and back to DFW! The wonderful honest staff got it and kept it behind counters waiting for someone to call and claim it. I called looking for my jacket and they volunteered to ship this to TX for me! I appreciate the kindness you have showed today! PfChangs rocks!"}
{"text":"We love PF Changs but visit to this particular location was less than expected. We ordered our usual hot and sour soup and it came with less soup and more veggies. We were literally chewing the soup. Server denied that it could be fixed since it was big batch made by them and it was all the same.

Other 2 items were OK. But overall experience was not good on such prominent location (The Strip)."}
{"text":"Want to start off saying my server has been good but everything else has been beyond lacking.  So I ordered a knob creek old fashioned.  It came to me with water in it? And not just a little bit but a lot? My server apologized and had the bar make a new one. The replacement drink came and it was like straight sugar. How can the bar not make a simple drink like an old fashioned.  So I ordered the pepper and wine braised flank steak. When my meal arrived the plate they brought me clearly was a dirty unwashed plate. The dish itself was slightly small for portion size. There was only two pieces of broccoli in the whole dish and the nappa cabbage was weird super wilted soggy bits with a very anemic color. The flank steak was super dry almost unpalatable. The white rice was also very dry. I don't expect authenticity when I come to P.F. Changs but I do however expect to get quality, definitely not way beyond sub standard quality.  So I asked for my check and brought attention to the dirty plate.  The server said \"eww\". How do you think I felt? She didn't even bring a manager over or anything. I have my bill... none of my food or drink was discounted. I didn't even touch the second drink because it was too sweet. I don't expect to just get a discount because something went wrong, but my dinning experience was more than just a little wrong. At the very least have the manager come over and apologize. - STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately what used to be one of our favorites in the area has repeatedly (3 times) disappointed, primarily due to very poor service.  We did complain to corporate who then contacted local management who called and provided a gift card but I don't think this will change our mind about where we go in the future.  Too bad as this was one very we'll run back in the early days of its opening and then for a few years.  Competition is too great to run a restaurant this way and expect folks to become loyal customers."}
{"text":"Me and wife really enjoy eating at this place. It's modern, tasty, and comfy. The only real complaint i have about this place is that the hostess or host whichever is working at the time seems like there doing you a favor by letting you eat at this establishment. The hot and sour soup is the best i have had in Pittsburgh, really good and filling!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why they were having people to wait to be seated but they had at least 18 of us waiting for over 15 minutes. There were only 2 in our party. We left, so not sure how much longer it would have been. I could easily see 9 tables open. Maybe not enough staff. The speed they were seating the ones that eventually got seated was uncalled for. The manager stood near the front podium and never once helped to seat or check in people. Maybe slipping them money would have helped but they are far from being that type of restaurant. We weren't the only ones who left, too many better options around worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Anna served us tonight and did an absolutely splendid job.

The food was great and so was the ambiance.

Thank you for helping us enjoy our family outing."}
{"text":"Last time I came the service was HORRIBLE. but I believe in 2nd chances so I came back today and it's empty and everyone is so nice!! Happy Hour is pretty good. It's until 7 pm which I think is pretty reasonable time! The only think I would say about happy hour is that you have to sit at the bar for it to work. But overall better than last time!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  I think the happy hour food ad drink selection is great and the prices (even not during happy hour time) are reasonable.  I always get the ahi tuna app, the shrimp dumplings and shrimp fried rice. My husband loves their pork lo mien."}
{"text":"We ordered through a delivery service. The delivery was on time and really exceptional but the food was inedible. After one bite, we threw away the Kung Pao Shrimp. My husband called PF Changs to let them know. They were unconcerned and blamed it on the delivery service. Not cool. This was a second effort after a previous poor experience- in the restaurant. This place is way too expensive to not care about its product, service or reputation."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our daughter for lunch today and were extremely disappointed with the whole experience. The food was not as good as we had remembered and the service was horrible. Our daughter spilled an entire cup of Egg Drop Soup on the table. Our server witnessed the incident and never brought over a rag to clean it up. We sat there for about 10 minutes with soup spilled all over the table. When our food came out, the man proceeded to place the food around the spill and then told us that he would bring a rag out. A few minutes later we still didn't have a rag and our food was getting cold. I eventually used diaper wipes I had in my purse to clean up the spill. Our server returned to the table at least three times and never mentioned the spill or the lack of help cleaning it up. The rag never did show up. We will not be returning to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"Don't even know where to start with this place. Service isn't usually something that bothers me that much, I feel like the ambiance and the food are the most important factors. In this case, I just couldn't ignore the service (or lack there of). To begin, we had a reservation and still had to wait for a table (understandable, but still). 

We are finally seated, given menus, and order our drinks and the lettuce wraps since we know already we are going to want that. At this point we hadn't ordered our main dishes yet. 

So we browse the menu, and decide what we will have as main dish. Our waiter however, is no where to be seen. In fact, we couldn't even flag down another server to call our server. We wait and wait and wait, and he finally appears with our drinks. We order our main dishes, and one of the girls in our group asks for sugar. He leaves, and nothing. No sugar. 

He comes back a long time later with our lettuce wraps and when my friend asks again for the sugar he says coldly \"It is already on its way- I asked for it already.\" Woah there, way to be friendly! He also explains they only have one kitchen for two floors and that is why the food is taking so long. I'm sorry, that is not an excuse in my book. There are way bigger restaurants in New York City that are able to accommodate a big space with a full house. 

Our food finally arrives, and our friend the waiter once again makes a snide remark when one of us ask for something. I understand you might be having a bad day, maybe lost your paycheck at the Blackjack table, but don't bring your problems to work, buddy! 

The food itself was really good, we had Singapore Noodles which I kept serving myself more and more of. We also had the orange beef which was good but not my favorite, was slightly chewy. The black bean chicken was fantastic-- delicious! And of course you cannot go wrong with the lettuce wraps though we made a huge mess. 

At the end, my lovely girlfriends had asked the waiter to bring out a Birthday Cake and even gave them candles they had previously purchased. Our dear friend walks out with the slice of cake with the candles, and proceeds to light the candles in front of our table and just drops it in front of us. The cake was pretty good, chocolate cake is my absolute fav, but the raspberry sauce was a bit too overpowering for me. 

I definitely recommend going to one of PF Chang's other locations. I had a great time at the Atlantic City branch, complete opposite experience to the experience I had here. Get it together, PF Chang's!!!"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot. 

Stopped here before a movie and ate at the bar. We got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats. 

I recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good! Who knew I liked green beans?! And this trip I tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll. Although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef, it was extremely fresh and delish (so who cares if it's not beautiful?!)"}
{"text":"From start to finish our experience at PF Changs was amazing. We were seated as soon as we walked up, our drink order was taken and received within five minutes and our food arrived shortly after we ordered it.

The waitress was amazing, she was attentive and checked on us often during our meal, never letting our glass go empty.

The food was excellent, and the portions were big enough we even had some leftover for a late night snack!"}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago for a friends birthday. The food was great and so was the service. This was the first time I ate here and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Four of us went at 7:00pm on a Wednesday night and it was busy with a wait list. We forgot to call ahead and so we went to the bar area to wait (which was also full). There is an outside patio area off of the bar, but we chose to stay inside. We did not have to wait very long (20 minutes). The staff was friendly and efficient. Our appetizers were delicious and I ordered the lemon-grass shrimp as my entree (one of my Favs). The manager came back and apologized that they were out of that dish, so I ordered the Ginger Salmon. He then sent us some complimentary shrimp dishes! I was so full that I took home the salmon for dinner the next evening (it was delicious)! I really appreciated the extra effort they made."}
{"text":"Been to this location multiple time...as always great food ...BUT...the last experience at this location was not so great......waited over 45 minutes for an appetizer and only recieved it after I asked a couple of times .... was pretty disappointing visit to say the least"}
{"text":"Beware of takeout. This was the second time I ordered takeout, a bowl of wonton soup. Both times, it was mostly broth. For $7.25, I received a quart of broth, 3 spinach leaves, 2 small shrimp, and 3 wontons. I will say the wontons are very good, although quite a bit smaller than you usually get at your neighborhood Chinese restaurant. 
My husbands meal was fine although smaller than the size you receive when you dine in."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with a friend last Monday night.  As usually, the food was great!  We were pleased to see their new prix-fixe for two menu and took advantage of the $40 price. With the dinner for two we got an appetizer, 2 entrees, soup, and dessert.  We had the lettuce wraps to start and my friend had egg drop soup and i had the hot and sour (the BEST!).  I had beef with broccoli and my friend had the honey chicken.  They were very very good!  To round out the dinners, we had the tiny desserts - mine tiramisu and hers lemon cake - which are just the right amount of dessert!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my mother, and even getting there at 1:30pm, it was pretty busy!  It isn't hard to see why - their lunch plates are a steal and a very good deal at $10 for a lunch portion, rice, and soup or salad.  We ordered the fried green beans to start, which, as always, were FANTASTIC!  Mom had the lemon chicken, which was tangy and sweet and quite nice and I had the Moo-goo-gai-pan, which was yummy, but a little bland.  She had egg drop soup and I had the hot and sour, which I feel is the BEST around!  I love PF Changs and am so happy to find they are adjusting their prices!"}
{"text":"Great place to go when your not on a budget.  All PF Chang's for the most part are consistent.  We enjoy this one to avoid the crowds and long waits.  

Start off with their lettuce wraps or salt & pepper calamari, delish! Sichuan shrimp & scallops are the best and something I always order.  Sometimes they give me a hard time about splitting the order with shrimp/scallops, but not at this PF Chang's.  The honey chicken and spicey chicken are also good."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's is a staple in our annual Vegas vacation.  I know of all the places to eat in Vegas we stop here every year.  This year was a 5 star because of our waiter, Greg.  He was funny and on top of everything.  He started our night off great. 

As for the food P.F. Chang's food is always good but if you are a true Asian food connoisseur then this place is not for you.  In the end if want good food and drinks that are reasonably priced in Vegas. This is a great place."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant dozens of times for at least nine years and have really enjoyed it .... until now.  5:30 dinner in an almost empty restaurant and the manager seats us next to the kitchen.  Then she assigns us the worst waiter I've ever had ... really ... EVER!  Then the food comes, and we know from experiencing it before,  that something was missing.  So we called the manager.  Our waters completely empty and she seems annoyed that we were complaining but NOT surprised it was \"David\".  She did not apologize or offer anything except a bad attitude.   BEWARE OF THE NEW MANAGEMENT AT THIS LOCATION."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was the spacing.  It was too cramped.  I felt like me and my date had the smallest table in the place.  There wasn't enough room for all the plates we had.  Also they had real lit candles on the table which made me nervous because of the lack of space.  My date seemed to get bumped by people as they walked by.  As for the food, I've had better.  It was good, but too pricey.  We got the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Kung Pao Scallops, and Mu Shu Chicken.  The service was great and I think it's a good place to go if you want more of a restaurant experience than regular Chinese take-out."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly, but waited 10 to 15 minutes before flagging down someone and asked her if she could send our wait person over. It turned out she ended up taking our table. She was ok-not super fast or overly friendly but efficient enough. The food was average- compared to some of the other PF Changs I've been to.  The  vegetables were tough and the overall quality was just not there. I'll go back to PF Changs, but not this one. It took forever to pay too-very annoying."}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:00 and told the seater we had a party of 6 people. The guy disappeared after telling us he'd get a table set up for us (the restarurant was empty).We never saw that guy again... Aftter watching 4 other parties be seated by another hostess, my hubby intervened as the hostess was seating yet another party and then we finally got our table. Rob the server in training was awesome-He totally saved the experience. The food was good-PF Chang quality-all in all a very good experience. Not the best, but not the worst."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service!  My family and I went to PF Changs around 5:15 p.m. yesterday night (Sunday).  There were not a lot of customers and we were seated immediately.  No one came back for over 10 minutes and then a manager said our waiter would be there shortly and she could take our drink order.  We told her that all we needed was water.  We waited another 10 minutes to get the water.  A little while after that our waiter showed up to take our order.  We ordered the Edamame and an entree each.  We waited about 20 minutes before the Edamame was served.  We then sat for another 45 minutes without being served our entree's.  After an hour we walked up to the host to tell him that we wanted to leave and would pay for our appetizer.  The Host went to find the waiter who apologized and said that he knew our order was unreasonably slow and that he had tried to speed the kitchen up but was told to wait.  I have never left a restaurant after ordering before but this was rediculous.  We wasted over an hour and 15 minutes and left hungry.  We have eaten at P.F. Chang's before and it is OK for fast food bland chinese, but it is not worth the wait and we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Lettuce raps were excellent and so was my dinner of Mandarin Chicken; very friendly staff"}
{"text":"We had PF Chang's take out while we were staying at PH. I liked that you could call ahead of time and pick it up to go back to your room, but that's about all I liked. 
It took forever for them to make it. We went to pick it up like 10 min after it was supposed to be ready and ended up waiting another 20 or so. But to top it off, they got the order wrong. We called and they said they would make what we were supposed to have real quick an bring it up to us. After close to an hour, we had finished eating what we did have and called to check on our missing food. They told us it should be up to the room in 20. When we said to keep it and refund us, they got all hissy and basically asked us why did we ask them to remake it anyway. We said because you told us it would be up \"real quick\".. 
Over all, the food was blah to mediocre (i would have rather had panda versus pay the price of that crap) and the service was horrible. Spare yourself and go to Panda Express. Same thing but you'll be able to throw $15 extra on the tables ."}
{"text":"Knowledgable staff, great recommendations, priced reasonably, food was excellent, try the Salt and Pepper Shrimp.  Pork Fried Rice was very good."}
{"text":"Great place to have a delicious dinner. Large portions make it perfect for sharing. And shout out to our server Kyle. He was very attentive and super friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited P.F. Chang's the other evening.  We sat at the bar where the service was very good.  We enjoyed the lettuce wraps with chicken (very good).  We also had the ribs which, although they had good flavor,  were a bit chewy. The food is all a little too salty for us."}
{"text":"It was ok. Over priced for quality. The Pei Wei chain is better in taste."}
{"text":"I heard all the hype about this place, but I don't see what's too special about it. I ordered some type of Beef and Broccoli and \"ack\" it was pretty salty. I paid something that wasn't really worth buying. The quality is pretty low compared to other \"Chinese\" restaurants (According to some Chinese people, some of these food didn't really come from China) like the Wok. I'm not coming back, unless it changed its quality."}
{"text":"3.2 Stars
Had a private room for dinner on New Years Eve with our group of 13 to avoid the crowds about two years ago. It was nice and big enough. Servers were really friendly too. The food was just alright, nothing special (this was my 1st of 2nd time at PF Changs). Dessert service was great though. The waiter or waitress (I can't remember) gave us visuals of the desserts so we could choose what we wanted. I had a Cheesecake and it was really good. We ended the night watching fireworks from part of our parties hotel room at New York, New York hotel."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner. Salmon was excellent. Had what should have been a great appetizer. Requested chili paste. Could not tell by red color that it is 50% added salt. Manager said others have had the same complaint. Enjoy your dinner but skip the chili paste. (Manager took the appetizer off the bill that I could not taste because of excessive salt in chili paste.) Use Sriracha sauce instead!"}
{"text":"Hello again fellow yelpers!! So me and my boyfriend went to this location a couple nights ago to eat dinner and boy oh boy has the service changed!! Or maybe it was just our waiter, I will give the restaurant the being it of the doubt and say it is just the one waiter. I am going to also give the waiter the benefit of the doubt and not say his name even though I really want to (he he) but we are adults so I will not, nay!! Shan't not haha. 

Anyway so we sat down and the guy was just rude from the start which was fine maybe it was just an isolated incident but oh no not even close. He takes our drink order and as we wait I am looking at the menu and my most favorite dish wasn't on the menu!! So he comes back with our drinks (I got a pot of hot tea) and I ask about the menu item in question he says that no it's not but they will still make it for me so that was really awesome. We said we needed another minute but that I would like some sugar. Without even acknowledging the fact that we said anything to him he just walks away! And just to put the rest of the meal into perspective for you he did this every time we said or ask him anything. So he comes back to take our food order and he never brought me my sugar. I probably sound like a crotchety bitch but I'm sorry I'm not down for paying good money to come eat at your place of work and you treat me like I am an inconvenience of some sort. 

The only reason they are even getting 3 stars is because gosh darn I love there food, it is so delicious every time  and it doesn't treat me like I don't exist lmao. The only reason they lose 2 stars is for that crappy waiter!!! Honestly he was really bad, my boyfriend and I just started laughing about it because he basically took his potentially bomb diggity tip and tossed that shizz straight out tha winda. 

Basically go eat here it is worth it and the food is o'mazing just pray you don't get helped by he who must not be named"}
{"text":"I do like this place.. is it the best no, but I am finding that Phoenix is kind of hard to find Chinese that is good and not in a shady looking place.. I am very paranoid about food poisoning and I'm very picky about food.. 

So Pf Chang's, yes its a chain, its not own by Chinese people and its kind of generic but its good for what it is.. The hostess always do seem to be snotty but the waiters are nice and quick, the bar is a little expensive but that expected at a restaurant like this, but they do have a great martini menu.. Sometimes I splurge.. 

I usually always get the Chicken Lettuce Wraps which is one of my favorite things on the menu, they are messy but really good. I tried the vegetarian Lettuce wraps and they were just as good, maybe even better.. I asked if they were really vegetarian (I worked at a restaurant that claimed to be but weren't) and the waiter said that it was suitable for a vegan.. good to know.. 

For entrees I usually get the Kung Pao Chicken, very good never disappointed.. The Mongolian Beef is also pretty good.. There noodle dishes as alright pretty basic, haven't found one that I would routinely order..  But the thing I like about the food is that it is down well.. It never is too fried, or too oily of slimy etc.. some many Chinese restaurants I've been to just left me feeling like I ate a whole bucket of McDonald's fries, Chang's doesn't leave you with that heavy icky feeling.. 

Is it the best ever? No, but for what it is its good, I don't go often but when I do go I enjoy it.."}
{"text":"Awful service. Food was overpriced and mediocre. My white rice was mushy and did not have any texture and the fried rice? It came out cold and dried like it's been sitting around for a while. My waitress never came by to check how we were doing, she only came by to say \"I'm so tired!\" Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant.  The Mongolian beef is my favorite.  I love the atmosphere.  The service and food are all great.  Get the lettuce wraps too"}
{"text":"There was a bunch of us, which do frequent this location at Northlake!   We had everything from the lettuce wraps. Which Are my favorite, Mongolian beef. Ribs. Garlic noodles and most of all the Delish 6 tier chocolate cake!!!! It is  always fabulous and service is usually impeccable, as it was tonight.  Ti our waiter was addorable and on the money.  We love the manger Jason!!  We will be visiting you in Southpark soon!!"}
{"text":"PF Changs is OK. The Kung Pao is tasty. Their sweet and sour soup is ok. The lettuce wraps are good. I am just not that impressed with this place because they charge too much money for the unexpceptional food you are get and the portions are too small (and I  rarely think that when I go out to eat).The music they play over the loud speakers is way too loud, it isn't dinner music but rather some mainstream radio played so loud that it is difficult to have a conversation with the people you are having dinner with and you feel like you have to listen to someone else's taste in music at too high of a volume."}
{"text":"While the food is always pretty decent at any PF Changs, the service at this location was pretty dismal. Our waitress, Catalina, seemed too rushed to take the time to listen to us or answer any questions. She was rushing us to order, rushing us to eat, rushing us to finish, rushing us to get out the door.  It was as if she got paid based not on good service, but on how many groups she could rush through in a given time period."}
{"text":"Faux-chines that works just fine. 

must haves:
shrimp dumplings
chicken wraps
Mongolian beef
mini desserts"}
{"text":"Any place that accommodates with a special dietary menu for a little known disease gets five stars from me.  P.F. Chang's has a dedicated Gluten-Free Menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease.  They also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  I don't know many other restaurants that go this far.

Aside from the menu preference, I enjoy my overall experience every time.  Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don't expect this to be at all like that.  It's not a Buffet.  They don't sell \"General Tso's\" (though Chang's Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.  

The prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it's well worth it.  Portions are excellent and the taste is great.  I've yet to have one complaint and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.

The only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.  It's also very dark because of their lighting.  However, I think it sets the atmosphere.  It can be a romantic place or a casual place, I've been there for both."}
{"text":"Food good. Lost my appetite because the restaurant is not very clean. Menus were filthy with grease all over them. Sat in booth & had to dust off food on the seat. Won't  come back. Sad"}
{"text":"GAH! Please, people! don't torture your poor defenseless taste-buds by shoveling this horribly tasteless food like product into your mouth holes. It is so cruel to send food over them without them being able to do what they love and long to do. Seriously, I've had finer dining at a $8 all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet. 

The Mongolian beef is to die for... I'm going to die 'for I ever have to eat it again. It's not that it's just a smidge bland, I've had spicier Big Macs, it was that it was drowning in a pool of brownish blandy sauce. I had to pepper my Mongolian beef! DID YOU HEAR THAT? Genghis and Kublai are very disappointed. I think maybe even a tear or 2. And the plum sauce for the Moo Shu pork was gawdawful. Scrape it off!!! My tongue hurts. Now the orange chicken wasn't too bad and maybe even moderately okay. 

Now the service I had most recently, this one on Mill, (I've been to 2 different muthuh PFers just in case) was not all that great. The guy was a big stick but with a d instead of the st, ya get it? huh? huh? get it? But that's hit or miss at any chain.

And then the bill! I haven't felt that violated since grade school. Same kind of bad taste but only money was taken this time. It's one thing to pay a moderate amount for good food with good atmosphere but this place is just Panda Express in trendy clothes. 

I should have gone to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I went to PF Chang's specifically to try their gluten-free (GF) menu. I had heard that PF Chang's has excellent kitchen practices in place to avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing items. I also heard a touching story that the reason the restaurant has a legit GF menu is because the CEO's daughter has Celiac disease. I don't know if that's true or not, but it is a nice thought at least.

The gluten-free menu is slightly limited, but I knew immediately what I wanted...the Mongolian Beef! I got mine with white rice and I made sure to specify that our table needed gluten-free soy sauce (which our waiter promptly brought out to me). The Mongolian Beef was the bomb! Sweet and slightly spicy, with crispy edges, yet it was still tender. My husband ordered from the regular menu and had a Cashew Chicken dish. He liked his a lot, but he preferred my Mongolian Beef. It was really, really good. Our waiter was pretty nice too. I thought he was attentive, and he didn't make me feel weird for asking lots of questions about the menu and making special requests. 

This review is only four stars instead of five for the following two reasons. 1. We waited a LONG time to place our orders. It was a bit excessive. However, once we did order, it didn't take too long for the food to come out. 2. I thought the food was really, really salty. I love salt, so it didn't ruin it for me, but I felt it was a bit excessive, and I had to drink about a quart of water later. Otherwise, it was a great experience, and I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"First time at a P.F. Chang's and the bartender pointed me in the right direction food wise. Had the Kung pao chicken and it did not disappoint. Friendly staff and good food!"}
{"text":"We had great service as we visited this location this past weekend .. The drinks were great and the staff was awesome. I made a reservation since  we never go out and wanted to make the best of it. Lol the food was very tasty for a chain the ambiance was also very nice ."}
{"text":"My first time here was for Mother's Day. Let me start off by saying that our server has really good customer service although it seemed a bit too much at times. Food wasn't what I expected. Only bad part was that when they brought us our plates they were all dirty and still had food on it. Our waiter took back our plates only to bring us more dirty ones. As he brought those back he started to wipe down the plates instead of getting us new ones. At one point he had dropped a plate and just casually picked it up and wiped it. Really gross. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Vote for Pedro! My waiter was awesome! We had the dinner for 2 with scallops and Mongolian beef. Omg! Scallops burst in my mouth. Thanks Pedro for an awesome lunch!!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced faux-Chinese slop for white people.  It's a chain and has the word \"bistro\" in the name.  Do the math.

If you like overly sweet, gloopy, cornstarch-thickened sauces, this place is for you.  The ingredients themselves are high quality, but the portions are small and prices are really high, all things considered.  

Any strip mall Chinese slophouse can do about the same or better.  If you're still on the search for really good Chinese in Charlotte, look elsewhere.  Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"I can not get enough of this place love the food the crispy green beans and chicken lettuce wraps are he bomb.com the mojito are great!"}
{"text":"PF Chang's is an excellent example of how much a really good manager can effect a resturant and the customer's experience.  Let me extend a special 'shout out' to Matt, the manager of the  Superstition Springs Blvd, in Mesa, AZ location.  

Today my husband, his 96 year old mother and I went to the PF Chang's located on  Superstition Springs Blvd.  We walked in and  were greeted by a bubbly hostess ~ she sat us . . . and then  it appeared we had been forgotten about.  After nearly 20 minutes of not being waited on at all my husband stopped an offical looking man, asking if he had any idea who our waiter might be.  The clean-cut man stopped what he was doing, took our drink order and offered us a complimentary appetizer as an apology.  He suggested the calamari ~ we accepted (although calamari has never been anything I found appetizing).  Within minutes we were served the most delicious calamari I have ever tasted.  It will forever change my thought about calamari, although I'll be surprised IF any place else can match the tenderness and light taste of what I ate tonight.  It was amazing.

We ordered our entrees and each one was delicious, obviously prepared with care.  My mother-in-law eats like a bird normally, but tonight she was eating like a hungry teenager.  She loved every bit and couldn't stop talking about coming back.

We will be back . . . with more guests.  Although we got off to a slow start, the manager, Matt, treated us like gold ~ actually, like valued customers.  I can't say enough about the Superstition Springs PF Chang's. 

Blessings

{"text":"My daughter & I enjoy  PF Chang's each time we dine there together. I am in Love with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps delicious! It is always a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I let my dad choose the lunch spot yesterday, and he chose PF Changs. It wasn't bad. The hostess was a total snot. 

We had veggie dumplings to start, and I am a little disappointed that they've changed them from 6 small dumplings to 4 large ones. The large ones just don't cook up the same way and were not nearly as good. Bummer. 

They have a few new things on the menu, one of them being Dali Chicken. I had this, and it was really tasty. Chicken stir fried with potatoes and red chiles....it's hard to screw that up! Surprisingly, this dish ended up being really spicy, which was a nice change from Chinese food posing as spicy when the peppers are really just for decoration. 

Dad ordered the ginger chicken. It was good too, but it sure wasn't anything special. 

Bottom line: There isn't anything here that you couldn't find in a Martin Yan cookbook and make 10x better, and cheaper."}
{"text":"Waited for 40 minutes past pick up estimated time. Was treated poorly and finally had to tell the hostess to go get my order, that I had been there too long for just soup.  Received my order without sauce, silverware or a cookie. Maybe I am being hard on them, but how hard is it to get a pick up soup order?  I used to love this location, but now I'm just disappointed. Don't do take out. It takes longer than just going in and ordering.  Staff is unhelpful and does not know what they are doing. Overall, bad service and not worth visiting.

P.s. I found a hair in my soup! No stars!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of PF Changs...we had a group of 20 people. They have two private rooms with a pre-fix menu you can choose from...the food keeps coming! Felt as if it was never ending.

Call ahead for big groups...talk to Darnella!"}
{"text":"Lettuce Wraps were awesome. I had the peppered beef which was great as well. Perfect day to sit on the patio. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"On December 7, I ordered lettuce wraps and banana spring rolls for dinner - I got them delivered.  A little after I ate, I felt sick.  I did not sleep well and felt like throwing up all night and all morning.  Terrible heavy feeling in my stomach, and I felt like I was poisoned.  I think they may have mishandled the chicken or the mushrooms in the lettuce wraps and that made me sick."}
{"text":"This was my second ever time eating at P.F. Changs Goodyear and it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had. To start it was my birthday so i was expecting more. We had reservations for a table for four and was told when we got there that it would be a wait. We settled on a half booth half table that was open to avoid the wait. Here's where it starts going bad. Something had spilled under the table and we were stepping in it. We alerted the host and they said someone would be right over to clean it up. No one came. We told our server who said he would clean it up. He didn't until we told him a second time. Next the food took well over an hour to get out and we didn't even get all of it together. The fried rice came out after we finished the egg rolls and spare ribs. The manager came out and apologised and comped some stuff and gave us a coupon and assured us there was no excuse. When we finally got the fried rice one of our orders was wrong. My girlfriend ordered dumplings and what they served was deffinately not it. All in all this B-day dinner was a let down and im not sure I'd come back.."}
{"text":"I have never been to Asia and am no authority on \"authentic\" or \"inauthentic\" Asian cuisine, as I am sure most people are not. I am not bothered by these titles and therefore dined at P.F. Chang's for the first time without any clear expectations other than a great meal. It was a friend's birthday and she wanted a small group to meet at P.F. Chang's for dinner. We sampled almost every appetizer on the menu and a great many entrees and from then on I was in love. Every dish I have had has been fantastic. They are very accommodating, as they offer a gluten free menu and many vegetarian options. They have a happy hour with discounted appetizers and drinks which is a really great way to try their appetizers for a lot less money. They also offer a \"Warrior Card\" which gets you 10% off your entire purchase and access to other goodies via email. They food is always great and really tastes like some love was put into it, an experience one does not often get in a chain restaurant. The staff is always very nice and incredibly helpful. On many occasions, the manager has presented coupons to diners to use on their next visit just as a thank you for dining with them. I took my mom to P.F. Chang's for her birthday (its her favorite) and our waiter brought us a complementary beef dish to ensure we had all proteins represented! I have never had a bad experience but I will say that this location in particular is very hospitable so I would recommend it for your first time. Don't let its lack of authenticity or the sheer fact that its a chain keep you from giving it a try."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try PF Chang's for quite a while and was even really excited when a coworker invited me to go. I had very high expectations because I have only heard great things about it. I was definitely let down. 

First of all, the wait was over an hour and a half. Second, the famous lettuce wraps were not the best I have ever eaten. Third, my meal of Lemon Prawns was bland and unimaginative. The best part of the meal was the delicious organic coffee I ordered. I was highly dissapointed and quite angry I spent so much for so little. I do not see what the big fuss is about PF Chang's, I don't I'll be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Dinner last night, Changs is always a good place as a fall back when you are outside your area. It has been almost a year since I have had dinner there, It was nice to see the additions to the menu but they should take the old items off. 

We ate at the bar and both of the bartenders were fantastic. The hostess seemed annoyed when we asked if we could eat at the bar."}
{"text":"It's was ok at best, it started when we entered the restaurant there was no friendly hello it almost seemed like we were unexpected. When it came to restaurant it was clean and about half full server was great, attentive and met our needs really well. Food was mediocre found a bit over cooked even found a chicken bone in the chicken lettuce wraps. Overall it was average, I have been to PF changs in Spokane and Las Vegas and the were both superior by far."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and love the food! I happily eat the ma po tofu every time:) We went for dinner and tried the crispy green beans...they were crunchy and came with a yummy dipping sauce...must try!
My friend had sichuan chicken flat bread which was also good..and the schendu(?) lamb which was good. From the description on the menu, the lamb sounded indian as it had been marinated and then cooked in cumin. Indian tasting chinese food doesn't sound appealing..but he assured me it was yum.
We also tried a desert cup which is a perfectly sized desert in a shot glass...both the choclate cake with rasberry sauce and the rasberry cheesecake were good..
The waiter was attentive even though the place was packed and dinner was yummy!"}
{"text":"its for sure not the classic chinese restaurant i am used to but it was a nice change of pace. the food wasnt bad and considering the suburban poshness of the place i cant say i had a bad time. the place had some pretty good drinks and the service was up to par. id for sure go back if im ever in scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went to PF Chang's last night for dinner and sat at the bar.  The bartender was awesome... 5 stars.  The food was just meh.  We had the pork dumplings for appetizer.  They were good enough.  When you cut into them, all the meat separate from the wrapper.  They were nothing special.  For our main, we split the salt and pepper shrimp.  The shrimps were plump and plentiful, but kind of oily. They didn't put anything, like lettuce, on the bottom of the plate to absorb the oil so the oil stayed with the shrimp.  Again, not horrible but nothing special.  Would I eat there again?  Sure...if I'm near by but is not a destination restaurant for me."}
{"text":"I always enjoy food at PF Chang's no matter which city,. Yes, it's chain.

We had to wait for like 20 min as it's very very busy..even around 5pm for dinner. We were seated and then no body came to us. I was very very hunry and anxious as I had to catch a flight. O waved at a manager and he came right away and took our order. I mentioned that we are in a hurry and we need to catch a flight. Afterwards, the service was up. But we had to ask for water once. 

The food- Portions are very large and we were a party of 3
We ordered hot N sour soup - good
Fried Rice with Shrimp - very tasty with lots of shrmip 
Chendung Lamb - spiced and fried - very tasty and melts in your mouth.

Overall food was excellent. Service is bit slow but can't blaim cos they are super busy.

Very nice atmosphere. We spent $30 for dinner for 3 at the Las Vegas strip for a very tasty meal.  Fully worth it"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. 
Friend staff and consistently great tasting food. 
Don't miss a lunch or dinner there. 
Oliver"}
{"text":"I have tried this located several times and it seems each time I get a crappier waitor or waitress and worse service than before, which I didn't even think was possible.  Today my meal took so long that I couldn't even eat it there.  I asked for a box and had to take it with me to enjoy at a later time.  I have a whole hour for lunch, I didn't order anything crazy to make.  

This place has poor time management skills and is very disappointing.  The only thing good about this place is Zach the manager and Nichole a server.  I guess I should get their schedules and only go when they are working.  What a shame to have such great food and have it ruined each time by poor service."}
{"text":"My family was in town to celebrate my niece's 5th birthday and she wanted to go to P F Chang's for her birthday dinner. Our horrible experience started with making our reservations and continued to get worse throughout the night, ending with my niece getting food poisoning and my family having to drive back to California a day early with a sick 5 year old! Happy birthday!  
I called to make a reservation for a party of 9, 5 adults and 4 kids for 7 PM on a Monday, the slowest restaurant night of the week. The \"host,\" proceeded to tell me that he could get us a hightop table at 7pm, or reservations at 8:30 on a regular table... Both of which were suggestions that I replied with \"we have kids.\" Remember, this is on a Monday in July, in Arizona! He then asked if we would be willing to squeeze on an eight top booth... Probably should've been the first suggestion. We said yes, thank you! It's for my niece's 5th birthday. 
Fast forward to 7pm, we walked in an the booth was ready without a wait! But yeah, it's a Monday in July, in Arizona. Looking around, there were some open tables but oh well, let the small things slide, right? We asked for a sling for the baby. 
We sat down and our waiter came over after a few minutes. He was a nice guy, and seemed to be the only waiter in our area. He took our drink and appetizer order and after about 10 minutes he returned with our drinks, which included water, 3 teas and a coke. He then took our entree order which was family style 4 dishes, lettuces wraps and 2 sides. Our appetizers came out at about the 30min mark at which time we asked for the sling again. We ate the appetizers and then we waited, and waited, and waited. (The table across from us complained because they had waited a long time for their food as well.) We were there for over an hour and 10 minutes before our entrees came out. However, they forgot the rice and the lettuce wraps. Our waiter seemed to have too many tables and it looked like he asked for some help at one point so we let the timeliness go as well.  I mentioned again that we did not get the sling and we finally got it an hour and 15 minutes in. 
We chalked it all up as a difficult night out with the kids (as many of you can relate). Then, at 2am the birthday girl throws up all over the bed and continues to vomit every 15-20 minutes until 4:45 am when her parents decided to get home to California and left her birthday trip a day early! Mean while Grandma, Mom, Me, my Wife and Daughter are all feeling terrible as well! Some nauseousness and some diarrhea and reflux, but only birthday girl has vomited. 
Think twice before going to the P F Chang's at Kierland Commons!"}
{"text":"Consistently disappointing...

I struggled with whether to provide 1 or 2 stars and finally landed on one due to several factors: experience, price, and overall poor food quality.  

Having visited PFs several times in the past I had vowed not to return but was persuaded by my wife and the nagging popularity of the place that has me asking myself: 'Maybe I am missing something here'...

We did takeout and were told when we called that it would require an hour to prepare the food (we had called at 6PM and were expecting a little time, however that seemed excessive).  Upon arrival they had screwed up the order and to their credit did try to make things right by providing the food error to us for free while working 'on a rush' to correct the mistake.  All fine and good, but caused a delay of 25 minutes for our food with a screaming 2 week old in the car.  

We had Lo Mein that was excessively greasy while the vegetables lacked any crisp.  The dish had little flavor behind the grease, but with enough Sararchi sauce I could numb my mouth beyond taste. It felt like a dish that had been reheated in the microwave.  The portion was large, but whats a good sized portion if the food is low quality.  

My wife had crispy honey shrimp that was slightly better, but the portion in this case was on the skimpy side.  Their heralded lettuce wraps were just OK as well, with more water chestnuts than chicken and again lacking much flavor. 

With the overall poor experience we will steer of PFs in the future and look for smaller, more locally owned operations for our Aisan fix."}
{"text":"We had an exceptional experience here at lunch today. The operating partner, Blaine made sure we were quickly seated going the extra mile to clean the table himself. My husband really wanted a booth, and Blaine made sure we got one. 
Our waiter, Victor was very accommodating and respectful. He was prompt as well. He made sure I got the vegetarian substitution for my meal, and it was very good. 
In our experience, it is always a good experience at this restaurant, but today was perfect."}
{"text":"The service is always great at these restaurants. They make worthwhile suggestions even things they have had that may not be on the menu. In the past, they have even offered to tweak dishes to better suit my preferences ( eg. making a dish spicier than normal).  Price is very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you receive. As always, it is more fun with more people."}
{"text":"Great location, consistent experience, great food and service. 
I hold a lot of business lunches there and the service is always amazing!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this restaurant. Once again the experienced was totally enjoyable. We were a party of three and we got seated in less than 5 minutes. The server came just after the hostess left. Our server jot down our drinks and brought them back pretty quick. My family and I went with the Mongolian Beef, Hot and sour soup, combo of lo mein. 
The food  came in just after we finish our appetizer. Steamed dumplings. We definitively coming back to try other plates."}
{"text":"This rating got 3 stars because our server, Sarah, was very good! I got the lobster avocado roll, a new item, along with some other dishes and my boyfriend got the beef and broccoli. All were very good except for the lobster sushi roll. I give that a ZERO on flavor and originality. I think there was mustard on the roll... wtf?!? That is an ingredient that doesn't need to go anywhere near a sushi roll - ever. EVER. Also, Sarah told us that they've started taking the soy sauce off the tables and do it on request only... good to know! They also didn't do the pre-sauce mixture table side anymore. I don't know if it was that location specifically (because of heavy traffic flow) or what. The prices didn't reflect being on the strip which I was thankful for, but all in all - decent experience thanks to Sarah :)... otherwise I would not have been impressed. A good server appreciates another good server :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch there this past Sunday,12:30 is a great time to go as it is not very busy. We were greeted instantly upon walking in and within a minute or two we were seated.

We were greeted by a server who said that our server would be right over, he took our drink order for us  and returned quickly with our drinks.

We started with the lettuce wraps, they were great and we had some left over and asked to have them packaged to take with us, the server included more wraps with out us having to ask for them, AWESOME. We also ordered Wonton Soup but our entrees arrived so we opted to take the soup home, which served as a great snack that evening. I had the Norwegian Salmon, excellent dish, cooked perfectly and a great healthy meal.

Overall a good experience, even though the service was a little slow the waiter was very nice and we will be back."}
{"text":"Want to experience one of the most poorly run chains in Scottsdale...look no further than this P.F. Chang's!!!

Placed a take out order over an hour in advance and still had to wait 50 minutes for the order once I got there.  Sat and watched customer after customer walk out in disgust having waited a long time only to receive nothing.  As I sat waiting, they lied and lied to customers - \"only a few more minutes\", \"order is just coming out now\", \"order will be out shortly\", and the promise of a discount or gift cards for waiting.  None of this was true.  As I was leaving, my order magically appeared.  I get it home only to notice that my rice is missing and the ribs are cold and have clearly been sitting out for quite some time.  I ordered ribs and tofu, btw, nothing more.

This isn't my first issue with P.F., this exact scenario has happened to me twice before at the Kierland location.  I like their tofu and green beans so I keep trying but I've been visiting less and less because of the constant frustration.  There are other Kierland restaurants that I frequent that don't seem to suffer the same problems that P.F. has, I suggest you try them instead."}
{"text":"Americanized Chinese food. It is predictable and consistent but not enough flavor for me. It is like an upscale panda express. Not bad but not excellent either. If you want a safe bet then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Dined in at a bar table and the bartender (male, 35, bald) was very polite and professional and did a great job. Food was slow but hot and tasty. Service was good but slow since he was also bartending.

Also placed a to go order through the website to take home for my girlfriend and walked in through the carryout door and stood there for minutes with no one helping. Someone finally said that I had to go to the front hostess stand, where they made me stand on one side. The jerk who helped me (male, 25, black, medium curly hair) never smiled and was rude from the outset. Initially told me that I could not place an order because I had already ordered once today. A friendly carryout girl interjected and said it was ok, just needed a manager card swipe. Did so and rude male again made a snide comment as he handed me the credit card receipt. Signed it, took my bag, and walked all the way back to the carryout entrance. 

The rude guy carryout came running and yelling after me yelling that I was taking the wrong order and embarrassing me in front of everyone in that section who looked at me like a thief. Walked back to front stand to get correct bag and no apology whatsoever. Two completely different experiences and guess which will stick in my mind and make me NOT want to return?!?!?"}
{"text":"First of all, I LOVE pfchangs, but I  recently visited here and had really bad experience. The waitress hardly paid any attention to us. The hostess had to like help her. I even wanted to order a to-go...but I couldn't find her, so I just went up to the bar and ordered it.  I'm a server myself, so maybe I had high expectations. ..but I still tipped her like 12 on 30. I still love it though.  I'm not gonna be an asshole and say \"I'm never coming back\" bc I know i will, lol."}
{"text":"One of the best spots to eat in the Summerlin area near Boca Park. It will get busy after 6pm so a reservation is recommended. They have great customer service and all the servers are professional. Make sure to check out the gluten free menu."}
{"text":"I love this place but service was so slow we finally gave them 5 minutes and we were walking out without dinner. They came with two minutes to spare. Normally good but sorry to say not this time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Asian restaurant chains with lots of locations throughout the city. The menu offers a variety of selections and I have tried most of the items. I have eaten here dozens of times and have never had a bad experience. The staff has always been friendly and have a good knowledge of the menu. I know they offer a full bar but I have never had the pleasure of an adult cocktail."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say I had a bad experience here. The food was fair, our server Sammi was great but the front end manager? Whoa! What a piece of work! Her name is Laura. Has the personality of a dinner plate. We had a problem redeeming a coupon and this so-called manager could care less. She approached our table without a word or introduction. She stood stoically as we described our dilemma, and basically acted like we were infringing on her precious time or we were trying to scam her. Laura was beyond rude and condescending. Definitely needs to be coached on customer service. I felt bad for our server, she was sweet and apologetic the whole time. We left her an extra good tip. So, if anyone from PF Changs high up on the food chain is reading, my advice would be to get rid of your unhappy front end manager. I'm sure your server staff would be happy to see her go."}
{"text":"This would have been a 3 or 3.5 for good decor and nice tasting food, but the service at this particular location bumps it up to 4. Enthusiastic waitresses  (both times I went) who were very eager to share their thoughts & recommendations. The food and place were not what I expected. I had heard of PF Chang's, so I expected something Stephen Starr-esque (like The Continental). Boy was I wrong. Take your suburban go-to Chinese restaurant, make it feel more like an Applebee's, then make the food more \"zesty\", and that's PF Chang's. Chicken lettuce wrap was nice, and the sauces for most of the dishes were decent."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today, the food was very good, and so was the service! When we want Chinese food, we will  be going here from now on."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with our take out order last night. First the containers were not closed tightly on the changs chicken and sauce leaked all over everything, second the changs chickens looked half eaten there was hardly any food in container, 3rd the orange peel chicken was not good...my family all said panda express is better. We were all dissatisfied with the food and it was a birthday celebration ):"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Peoria on vacation and our Hotel was near this restaurant, so we decided to eat here on one of the nights. My wife ordered Kung Pao chicken and I was in the mood for sweet and sour pork. Sweet and sour pork was not on the menu but the waitress checked with the kitchen and they said they could make it. After approximately 30 minutes, we still hadn't been served and several people that were seated after us were getting their food. Eventually the manager, Gideon, came to our table and apologized for the delay. He said the chef had over cooked the pork and had to make a new batch. We weren't really in a hurry so it was not a problem at all. When the food arrived, it was fantastic. And, because of the delay, Gideon said the meal was on him. We will be returning to this restaurant in April, when we go back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Shannon wanted to get out for some \"fresh flavors\" last night so we dropped in early. We enjoyed the usuals, crispy green beans and pot stickers as well as szechuan scallops (off menu) and kung pao chicken. PJ took great care of us and Chris stopped by to say hello...he then previewed their WINTER MENU COMING JAN 27! Lots of things sound good so we'll have to check it out. He started talking NEW DESSERT WONTONS and when he hinted that the chefs were already on it, we asked if we could order. They're a little chewy--hey, they're not puff pastry--but both the vanilla cream and chocolate raspberry (our favorite) were delicious! I think our favorite part of this stop was getting the impression that both server PJ and manager Chris are INTO the food at PFC and enjoy what they do. Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"Took my niece here 4/5. First experience and this place is now on our short list to come back. Got the dinner for two. The appetizer wraps (lettuce leaves) were difficult to eat but so good we didn't care. We had sesame chicken and the honeyed shrimp. Wonderful. The dessert was baked bananas with coconut ice cream that's only made for them ... No words.
Yum"}
{"text":"First I will say I am giving this review 3 stars because its PF Changs and their food is always good HOWEVER, the service not so much!  We get there (its two of us) and the place wasn't busy at all and they sit us at a little table so, I asked if we could have a bigger table by the window no problem the hostess said (the hostess' were very gracious) and she sits us and we wait and we wait and we wait and we wait, so after 15 min of just sitting there (mind you several waiters and waitress made eye contact with us) I finally get up and walk to the hostess stand and advised them that we have yet to have someone take our drink order or even say I will be right with you and at that time I asked for the manager.  The manager comes over (I'm watching the exchange between the hostess, the manager and the waitress and the manager even seemed perturbed) and takes our drink order and then the waitress comes over and takes our order.

Other than the blatant disregard of the waiters and waitress not even attempting to assist us although they saw us sitting there the food was still delicious"}
{"text":"Terrible service tonight, was sat at a dirty booth. Ordered Mongolian beef, it was like chewing on over salted beef jerky, orange chicken was way over sauced. The only decent part of the meal was the edamame, chicken lettuce wraps and chang's spicy chicken(pretty hard to mess up these three) I was offered three times to box up the terrible food and repeated NO, but no one questioned why I didn't want take all of that food home.....Please re-evaluate the quality of food and standard of service, for the prices you charge! I would've been happy with Panda Express, SERIOUSLY!"}
{"text":"Usually I am a fan.  But at this locations it was horrible.  We had chicken cabbage wrap that had very little chicken (mostly bamboo shoots), Orange shrimp that were way too sweet. And a weird new salad that was horrible!  Stay away.  There so many other places to eat!"}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's is Chinese and Asian themed restaurant at the Planet Hollywood Hotel. The ambiance is casual and relaxed, decor and menu are Chinese and Asian influenced with an expected range of dishes. Have visited P.F. Chang's in many cities. This location in particular has a lot to learn and improve. Menu is the same but dishes are not cooked in the same way.
During our meal, we found food to be mixed. Chang Spicy Chicken was served with sweet chili sauce which is more usually featured in Thai cuisine but that was ok, the dish tasted not bad.  Kung Pao Chicken, which is a Sichuan style dish, was also pretty good. Chicken coating was interesting but we enjoyed the flavors of this dish. 
The Orange Peel Beef was a bad serving. Dish was served luke-warm and with a thick sauce that tasted odd. Orange peels didn't complement the beef or heavy sauce well. This dish didn't make a lot of sense taste wise. We'd skip this one next time for sure. Dishes are Chinese and Asian inspired instead of authentic but that is ok.
 Although the food was not bad, the atmosphere was lacking. I found it to be crowded and very noisy."}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance and most excellent service from our waiter this evening. His name is JR!! We had the chicken lettuce wraps which were delicious and light. Then we had the handmade dumplings, order them pan fried! And then the crab won tons... Nom nom. We have been in Vegas for three days, hence our six meal and this has proven to be the best so far"}
{"text":"Having been a PF Changs customer for quite some time, we were very disappointed this evening. It started with the drink orders. After about 10 minutes, watching our drinks sitting on the bar getting warm, we went and picked them up ourselves. 

We watched management & staff having a great time at the podium, no one seem to be managing the place. We did get an order placed our food arrived, the signature dish the PF Changs spicy chicken was overcooked and congealed. The other entrées seemed OK.

Manager did visit with us to see how everything was when we were finished with our meal. He didn't seem pleased to hear that we were not happy. However, he did handle everything in a professional manner. Don't think we're coming back to that particular PF Changs."}
{"text":"Try eating at PF Changs yesterday evening but there was over an hour and 45 minute wait so we left. Came back tonight plenty of seats dinner was good but nothing over the top to write home about the Asian cuisine was comparable to most Asian restaurants. The atmosphere was nice and the wait staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Have not been here before a friend of mine took me here the service was good the lettuce wraps were good and the Mongolian beef was good"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this location & this chain of restaurants!! Pf Chang's is always my favorite stop for good Chinese food. The food is served fresh from the wok & served straight to the table hot & ready to eat! The service here is always excellent. I have been to this location 2 years in a row for my birthday & they never disappoint. Whenever you're craving Chinese food that is fresh & always delicious Pf Chang's is the place to go!! (P.s. The Dali Chicken is my favorite)"}
{"text":"I give this place four stars for decor and service, subtracting two for overall value.  Not price...value.  In my opinion, PF Chang's is galactically overpriced takeout food, with the singular exception of their chicken lettuce wraps.  These are amazing, at least as much as that can apply to lettuce, and the only thing I would order again.  I've had several dishes, and end up feeling disappointed in each one- I love me some kung pao- theirs has simply been extraordinarily oily on the two occasions I've ordered it.  

OTOH, I have a couple of friends who swear by this place for their girls' nights out- to each her own."}
{"text":"It was my first time at a P.F.Changs.  I was not impressed.  It was good but not awesome.  Took along time for my group to get our lunch.  Egg drop soup was disgusting.  I love egg drop soup and that was the worst I ever had.  Spring rolls were good and there special combination of sauce was yummy."}
{"text":"Very good for a chain joint.   The service is usually hit or miss though and mostly miss.  As much as I love Chinese food we usually go to Ah So if given the choice."}
{"text":"food: very good; service: very good. started with the lettuce wraps and had the black pepper chx for the dinner. the chx fried rice is very good, too."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's In General to me has always seemed like a Glorified, Overpriced Panda Express with a crappy bar that floats every drink and skimps on the liquor. Nothing really stands out on their menu.. Changs \"Spicy Chicken\" Is a joke, it is ZERO Spicy, They used to have the Asian Grilled steak with grilled asparagus that was pretty decent.. But of course its gone now, And A lot of the items on the menu are run of the mill Asian fast food on fancy plates in a fancy setting.. Pretty much FAIL.. I would recommend avoiding.. Too Many good chinese places in Las Vegas to waste your time on these clowns. Although I must say the service is always on point at this location, They have some servers that should be working in a real award winning restaurant."}
{"text":"This P.F. Chang's has a very modern atmosphere inside their restaurant. It is located inside the Planet Hollywood. If you are feeling Asian cuisine, I would recommend eating here because the food is usually consistent at P.F. Chang's and the service is usually consistent as well!

The food came in fast and tasted fresh. Food is usually consistent at most P.F. Chang's and no difference this time around. You already know that Chinese food is saltier than most and oily. It also probably contains MSG which isn't bad at all, in fact, makes it more tasty! 

Had a great experience at this restaurant. Service was fast and the drinks were refilled without any trouble. They provided new silverware for each of the meals that thy served. No complaints  for me here for this P.F. Chang's"}
{"text":"Always love the Spicy eggplant with brown rice, also had the fried rice with chicken. So today I added something new, Garlic noodles with cilantro and red pepper flakes and this was suggested by the server. Hmmmm......I'm not a picky eater I always find something tasty in a dish, since i didn't in this dish I'm going to say maybe it's because I went right for my favorite dish first and I will give that dish another try soon. Still giving a five star cause I killed that eggplant. (Hehe) if you've never had their spicy eggplant you have to try it, it's a meal for two! So delish."}
{"text":"if you ordering online using online delivery services like Grubhub or Doordash . expect to wait 1-2 hours or cold food . the staff at this location deliberately delay online orders because they do not get any of the tips . same thing with pick up orders do not waste your time with this location ."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great cocktails  ! Staff was very friendly. It was a very good experience. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife for my birthday dinner. Our server made the experience way better than our expectations. They substituted some dinner options for us with no problem, food came quick, food was very tasty, and they gave us a few extras when they wrapped our leftovers (maybe because it was my birthday? )

Dining environment was very relaxing and was prefect for our date night. I would recommend the lettuce wraps, Mongolian Beef,  and New York style cheesecake. I look forward to eating here again in the future!"}
{"text":"Always consistenly good food here at PF Changs.  The menu stays the same but new items are also added for variety.  The ambiance is nice as well.  We were saying we could eat there every day!"}
{"text":"So, today at work, we had PF Chang for company lunch. The food was excellent. There was all sorts of food that took two tables.. I love Chinese food anyways, therefore, it was excellent. I had some steamed rice, shrimp, beef and broccoli, and much much more. I will definitely going there soon!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the lettuce wraps!  All is well but we've had 3 different servers so far.  Now I cant remember who to flag down for 2nd's :/  very good food and happy hour menu is awesome!"}
{"text":"Changs is really good. REALLY good and has been for the 15 or so years I've been going.  It's expensive but the best thing on the menu (besides Changs spicy chicken) is the sea bass. it is just OMG good.  and if you can't afford the sea bass, get the \"hot fish.\"  Changs never disappoints!"}
{"text":"My 3 year old son's favorite restaurant. I like it, the wife likes it. It's a winner. The food is good, the service is definitely adequate and items handed out with the children's menu makes dining there a lot easier on the adults. We're usually in and out fairly quickly too."}
{"text":"Quality of food has decreased rapidly: constant change of management. Not responsive to constructive suggestions as simple as food not cooked, food has no taste etc."}
{"text":"Food and service are great. We sat at the bar but the restaurant was unbearably cold we left before we really wanted to. You definitely lost out on another couple of drinks in revenue."}
{"text":"Salt levels are high enough to be legally classified as a food preservative!

I got the double fried noodles with pork, shrimp and vegetables.  Well, they DROWNED the dish with enough salty sauce (maybe 1.5-2 cups) to make it more like a soup than anything else.  Also, It was a struggle to find more than a few shavings on meat in the dish, disappointing.  I'm pretty sensitive to salt in my food because of my blood pressure and my best estimate is that this one dish probably had 5,000mg sodium in it.

Ambience - I appreciate the effort to be helpful, but we were brusquely interupted 9 times during our lunch.  Come on people - if my water glass is empty then discreetly fill it up, don't ask me LOUDLY if I want more water while interupting my conversation. At that point, you're not providing good service, it's just amateurish crap.

Would I go back? If I did, I'd order something very lite on the sauce, but then I'd discover that I'd ordered a meat and veg dish with minimal meat and veg.  So, what's the point coming back?

So PF Changs - BFD that you sponsor a marathon!? - what good is that when you make people sick afterwards with your insanely salty food, eh?"}
{"text":"Wow! So good! So fresh! Wow! The food is always absolutely delicious and the staff are always so friendly,attentive and helpful! We have tried almost every dish in the years we have been eating here,and,they are all delicious!
No MSG! Thank you for that! Just  great, flavorful,fresh food! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food and the mojitos are awsome. Depending on the day you might have to wait a few mintues for a table but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time,quiet,nice decor,nice seating.. Was greeted by the hostess,with out a smile..(don't really care)
I was taken to my table,a second after some one came in a lets us know someone else was our server and he offered us drinks..Juan Carlos our server was charming,great attitude,very knowledgeable,fast service..We ordered the lemongrass chicken salad,butternut squash sim dum,ahi tuna tartar,I loved my last item,had a good taste,not fishy at all."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant, we usually eat here once a week. Service and food are always amazing. We never have any issues or problems! Management always stops by our table to see how everything was! Sometimes the chicken fried rice is spicier then other times and i am a wussy when it comes to spice, but it does not stop us from going!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Food is awesome as well.  Very disappointed that Yelp had the wrong hours listed though!  They don't close at 10:30 but the manager on duty was very understanding and helped me out after they closed.  BTW, Google does list the correct hours."}
{"text":"Never again. I ordered dan dan noodles with NO CHICKEN (I'm a vegetarian), and half way through the dish, covering the bottom is CHICKEN. It says it right on the ticket, in big red letters, NO CHICKEN. And they still some how put it in ? Overpriced food in the first place and then to screw something up that is so simple. Not even worth a second try to be honest, and some of the noodles were \"blocky\" and cold. The only saving grace was Ashley at the bar doing take out, she was a sweetheart but I will not be back for the food."}
{"text":"We stop here at least once every year during our annual Vegas trip. We have always had decent food and service but today it was quite a different  story. We arrived for lunch around 11:15 and checked in. They told us there would be a 10 minute wait. I went back to request a booth as another group of 4 came in. They were shown to a table right away. I asked for a booth and why we were told to wait but the other party was seated right away. The hostess did not respond then proceeded to show us to a table, not a booth and apologized for the confusion.  It was a least 10 minutes before a server came. She apologized and said they were short handed and our server had not shown up. This server who took our table in addition to the rest of her tables was the only good thing about our experience.  Food was ok. Service below average."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Chinese food.  Have eaten there dozens of times and tried almost everything.  I usually get the Chang's Chicken (highly recommended) and the Mongolian Beef.  Too bad they discontinued the Lemon Pepper Shrimp, which was awesome.  The down sides are that there is often a long wait to get seated, over an hour at peak dinner hour, and the price is higher than most Chinese food.  But other people have had poor experiences there.  They do have some dishes that are not that great, and if that was all I had ever ordered there, I would certainly give them a worse rating.  I do not recommend their salads, for example.  Service is usually very good, and they have a full bar for most any trendy cocktail you might want."}
{"text":"Excellent food and amazing service.  What a pleasant surprise.  We were a large group and the manager was able to accommodate us in a very short time.  His name is Chris Hodges - and PF Chang's has got a gem with this young man.  He is warm, friendly and funny.  We will definitely visit again.  Thank you Chris for making this such a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"My rating is based on my experience at the Kierland Commons location. I have been a P.F. Chang's customer since they opened, and have hosted many business lunches, family lunches, dinners an special occasions over the past years.

2 stars for marginal service & average food quality. This chain started off as 4 stars and has been in a steady decline since 2006.

I just gave P.F. Chang's a chance to redeem themselves last week with a party of 8. The food was a 3, the overall experience was below average. I tried to engage the server and have some fun but she was a ROBOT and did the absolute minimum."}
{"text":"Got the mongolian beef excellent. A good place to get some warm supper."}
{"text":"Thus PF Changs goes the way of all restaurants.  Always a fan of the restaurant, even with their exorbitant prices.  Well, as long as the quality lasts.  Alas, the quality has crashed down to the quality of your local Chinese take-out.  The two beef dishes, mongolian beef and wok-charred beef, both contained an unnecessary amount of fatty beef, the unedible kind.  Sorry, PF, if that's what I can expect, I don't have to pay your prices!"}
{"text":"It was an exceptional lunch with exceptional service. Our waiter, Blaz was Awesome! We highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"EXCEPTIONAL service! This staff went above and beyond to ensure my Mother's birthday celebration was brought in the right way! Our server, Tony delivered world class service and checked in on us often. Not to mention the food was delicious and prepared to perfection! I've been to PF Chang's all over the country but this location has a special touch, amazing ambience, and the service again was memorable! Thanks again Tony!"}
{"text":"This was my first at PF Chang's. Excellent service by Scott.

I ordered chow mein, glazed shrimp, mongolian beef, kungpao chicken, and chicken with lettuce wrap. Everything was great. I was here on my birthday and got an awesome treat. Chocolate peanut butter cake was extremely delicious.

Lastly, they have a good variety of drinks as well.

Solid 5 stars *****"}
{"text":"I used to be a weekly diner here. They keep messing with the menu and cheapening the recipes ever since the buy out. It is really not good now. And the prices keep going up.  Since they now hire cheaper, inexperienced, help with a high turnover rate, getting decent service here is rare now too. More than once the food has come out all together - soup, entree, whatever. Rice is usually undercooked. Any recipe consistency is gone so what ends up on the plate is a surprise. Not for the better. Ask the server about the difference and they'll have no idea because most of them are short timers. Managers here used to walk the floor and were known to regulars. Now they  must hide in the back. This used to be one of the better Chang's and now it's just not worth the spend and aggravation."}
{"text":"The food is okay, definitely not worth the price, Pei Wei is just as good maybe even better and it is much more affordable.  We received the worst service at this location multiple times and will not return."}
{"text":"Been there before but a long time ago and remember food being ok but nothing special.  Wife and I just went this past Saturday because got a gift card for there.  Food was good and no problems in fact when I asked a question to our waiter, David, on a particular sauce I like and if had anything similar, the manager came over and spoke to me about it for a while and even suggested a cook they have that could probably whip it up for me when he's working some day.   David was amazing with our service as well.  Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Food is quite good, but they don't know how a shrimp looks like. We ordered delivery of several dishes including Kung Pao Shrimp, but we got chicken instead of shrimp. When calling them back to notify them about the mistake, they kept redirecting me to a manager who never picked up the phone. Ended up wasting not only dinner but also time.
I'm going to send them a photo of how a shrimp looks like, so hopefully their team will understand the difference between shrimp and chicken."}
{"text":"Nice facility, great service by Courtney (A guy). The chicken lettuce wraps are a easy choice and a great mix of fresh food and meat. Margarita is strong and I'm already tipsy( from drinking this afternoon). Oh the dynamite shrimp are frickin' awesome."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the Mongolian beef!  It was over cooked and tasted like leather!  The quality and service is indeed underwhelming at this restaurant!  They didn't even offer any compensation!  All I could eat was one piece of meat!  Such a disappointing place for Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"PF Chang's never dissapoints... Food is always HOT and the atmosphere is always classy and upbeat. I try not to go too often and to keep it a treat  :)"}
{"text":"Haven't been to pf Chang in probably 5 years because back then I wasn't impressed and stuck with other restaurants. Have to say that has changed. 
The chicken lettuce wraps we ordered without mushrooms and the only issue with these were geez at the crunchy noodles ... Order these on the side.
Sesame and Kung pao chicken were both fantastic. Can't decide which is my favorite and for desert we got the peanut butter crunch. Quite delicious!! Very happy and will be back."}
{"text":"P F chang's is a Chinese restaurant.I recommend to eat from this restaurant for many reason.the first reason is the restaurant offers many kind of food for example fish,chicken,beef,lamb,shrimp,soup and salad.they offer it fresh and testy.they offer the food with deferent kind of Sauce for example sweet and sour, honey and spicy.the food are testy because it is crispy and soft. the second reason is the waiters are friendly and quick.the service make you feel you important person. the food offered hot and fresh. the third reason is the restaurant is convenience because it is near from me and not crowded. the forth reason is the atmosphere. the restaurant make you feel you are in Chinese place. finally, I recommend this restaurant for Chinese food lover."}
{"text":"This was by far the BEST experience I have ever had at any PF Chang's, and the main reason was our waiter Alex. Alex is a Rock Star waiter! He was so attentive to us! Food was very good as well! Next time I plan a P.F. Chang's dinner out, I will surely be requesting Alex as my server!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Always sit in the bar area. Bartenders are always friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"What has happened to PF Changs?  The Mongolian beef I love is no more.  I ordered it for lunch today and the so-called beef strips tasted like uncooked bacon--all soft fat with no flavor.  I complained.  They redid it. Yuck it was just as bad.  They evidently are buying a much cheaper grade of beef.  It is Fat, fat, fat. I couldn't eat it and didn't want to take it home to try to doctor it up."}
{"text":"This place is crowded and we had to wait more than 30 minutes to get seated. Service is pretty good and food is a little bit salty but besides that we had a good experience."}
{"text":"As a former PF Chang's bartender, I will level with you and tell you that this is straight-up overpriced crap.  That being said, it's delicious crap!  Stop ordering Chicken and Lettuce wraps, it's just machine-separated chicken waste in brown sauce with water chestnuts.  Instead, get the ahi tuna or salt-and-pepper calamari.  For entrees, try the wok-charred beef, chicken with black bean sauce, wok-seared lamb, shrimp with candied walnuts, sichuan from the sea, and garlic noodles.  Don't waste your time with chang's chicken, you can get General Tso's at any chinese place for a third of the price.  The mini desserts are a good idea, and the specialty drinks are all very good.  And no, nothing comes with an egg roll."}
{"text":"I visited this location recently with my family, and I have to say that this location is substantially better than the Northlake location.  I used to work at Changs, and have my reservations about the quality and authenticity of the food, but I know that it tastes good!  Service was impeccable here, the manager visited the table to make sure we were enjoying our experience, and the food presentation was noticeably better than at Northlake.  Our server added several dishes to our meal at no cost to round out our dining experience.  Next time I'm at Changs, I'll be at this location."}
{"text":"Nothing special, other than the name.  
Pros: 
- Atmosphere was nice and clean
- Food came out fresh and warm
- I was seated quickly

Cons:
- Service was extremely slow
- Food was way over-priced
- Waited for a while to actually get my check
- Drink was never re-filled unless I asked (2 times)"}

{"text":"Looks like I should have read the reviews before I made the decision to even go to this restaurant....

Since I had just finished up at the mall  across the street, I decided I'd get some food to go. I went to this pf Chang's on Monday night (May 2,2016) when I arrived the hostess greeted me and I informed her that I would like to place a to go order. I actually LOVE Pf Chang's and was craving their lettuce wraps. Well, I placed my order of lettuce wraps and ginger chicken with broccoli and was told the wait would be 20-25 min. Ok, cool. 

I took a call outside of the restaurant and returned right at 20 minutes. I checked with the hostess to see if my order was ready and she said it would be \"a few more minutes\" well,  a few minutes turned into 20 more minutes. So I approached the hostess stand again to get an updated wait time. She went to the kitchen and returned, empty handed.... She then goes on to say that the kitchen has been \"very behind\" on this night and some guests that were eating inside of the restaurant had been waiting for \"about an hour\" for their food. 

Now, if she knew there were people in the restaurant prior to my arrival that were waiting for some time, why would she even quote a 20-25 min wait time for a to go order?? Needless to say, I told her to cancel my order and left. Had I been told from the beginning that the wait was almost an hour I would not have wasted my time nor the cooks time. 

To the operating partner, Everett Emery,  please ensure that your staff is upfront and honest with your customers to avoid any confusion and frustration. The hostess also seemed to be a bit overwhelmed with the phone, greeting guests and going back and forth to the kitchen. Perhaps she needs someone there to help her."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment this local Las Vegas Boca Park branch of PF Chang has turned out to be! PF Chang used to be one of my favorites. Even though it was always a bit more pricey than most other Asian cuisine-based restaurants, it usually seemed well worth the extra cost. This is no longer even remotely the case. 
This evening I ordered three entrees and a soup for takeout: the Mongolian beef, a chicken pad Thai, PF Chang's spicy chicken signature dish, and a large order of egg drop soup.
The soup was fine. 
The spicy \"signature\" chicken dish that was recommended by the staff tasted exactly like sweet and sour chicken and was over-cooked and mediocre at best. 
However the colossal, unforgivable failures of the evening were both the Mongolian beef and the chicken pad Thai.
The Mongolian beef was, in a word, inedible: it was tough, overcooked, way too chewy to even attempt to swallow, and beyond dry. There was absolutely no liquid, sauce or any moisture to be found in this dish. There were about eight to ten small pieces of steak in the container, which, when pro-rated at the ridiculous price of $18.50, was a serious ripoff. It was unceremoniously garnished with a few wilted green onion stalks. 
The chicken pad Thai was completely inedible as well. The rice noodles were severely undercooked and hard. Preparing rice noodles is not exactly rocket science, and yet, somehow this restaurant managed to mess them up. There was no sauce in the dish or any pad Thai sauce coating the noodles at all, making it pitifully dry and bland, had anyone been motivated to actually chew and swallow it.  No one was able to eat this dinner, except for the soup. 
The pad Thai, along with the Mongolian beef, will be brought back to the restaurant in the morning. This meal cost an astounding $63.76, and was a distasteful mistake I will not be making ever again. Shame on you, PF Chang. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came in 1/29 and despite being very busy and under staffed our waitress was amazing. Didn't get her name but she handled our special orders with no complaints and was very efficient as wall as pleasant. Food was on point as well."}
{"text":"Ordered  online for curbside  pickup. Always  wanted  to  try  this  restaurant .  Had gift card, so finally  this  was  my  time .  Ordered the sweet  and  sour chicken ,  orange  chicken ,  vegetable  fried rice, egg rolls ,  spring  rolls ,  and ribs. Everything  was delicious  except  for  the  ribs  which  had a terrible  flavor .  If I  lived  closer  to  restaurant, I  would  have  asked  for  refund for  ribs. My only  wish  is fried rice  be  a selection  with  entrees  instead  of  just  white or brown  rice . 
Maybe  one  day  I  may  visit  restaurant  again ,  but  to me the food is overpriced  for  quality . ..the fast food  Chinese  restaurants are just as good  for  a lower  price  for  what  I  normally  order . 
The curbside  service  was excellent !"}
{"text":"So I've given this pf changs several chances but I'm finally over it. I won't be going back...get charged 2.50 for extra chicken only to pick up my meal and I literally dug through it with my fingers after believing they had given me a vegetarian option of mein....for those that don't know the chicken is cut into tiny inch length pieces....when I was done sifting through the mess I counted 8...So if this is what extra looks like than what is the normal amount...for a dish costing 10+ dollars.....so I call the restaurant to have the manager simply refund the cost of extra chicken..I then ask what the normal amount of chicken is and am told four ounces at which point I said well that's good to know and then he hung up the phone!!! Great customer service.....I did not have anywhere close to four ounces food scales are wonderful things....so what then was I charged for 12.50 for a bowl of soggy noodles by the time I got to sit down to eat? Thanks pf changs...keep my 23 bucks.. And just know you've lost a customer."}
{"text":"PF Changs=chain restaurant, but the food was great so no complaints. Our waiter did a good job attending to the five of us. Food was delish and served in a timely matter. Found a new favorite: pan fried noodles with beef mmmm. Going to have to pick this one up to go next time I'm in need of some comfort food ;) All in all it was a great dining experience. One of the pluses of dining with a group is having the opportunity to try a lot more dishes. My only complaint is that the restaurant is a little dark, but perhaps its for the ambiance?"}
{"text":"Really PF Changs? You would allow your fast food version of you \" PEI WEI\" to be 100% better than your so called upscale chinese sit down dinning? Let first off say that I was warned about PF Changs not being as good as Pei Wei and of course I didnt listen. We decided to go here because it was a date night and we wanted to sit down and enjoy some good chinese food that wasn't take out. Oh how I wish we would have just went the other route.

Restaurant was pretty crowded but that's expected on a Friday night and totally understandable. The problem started with the fact that  our waiter wasnt sure if they had sparkling water because they may have ran out and then I could hear him tell the table next us that he wasn't sure if they had lemonade, come on shouldn't you know what you have and dont have?

Okay so we order mongolion beef and kung pao chicken which is what we always order from Pei Wei 
and its always delicious. Not the case here, the kung pao chicken had barely any spice to it and the mongolion beef was so rubbery that the first two bites were spit out because they couldn't be chewed and so I let the waiter know that we were sending it back, he could have cared less and didn't even offer to make us something else which is poor service but honestly I know better then to send food back and order something else anyways.

We ended up sharing what was left of thr kung pao chicken and called it a night. We will not be returning to PF Changs and we will stick to what we know and just go chinese food is where its made right.... PEI WEI"}
{"text":"I have to say, I am not a big fan of Chinese food. But I have so far come to this location about 3 times.All my visits here have been amazing with amazing food servers. However tonight topped them all. My boy has severe food allergies to nuts and shellfish. I have to say they take that very very serious and I'm truly amazed by that, Brittany our server made sure to bring us the list of what is safe for him to eat and she even checked with the chef and put an alert on the order. When they brought his food out it was in a completely different plate and it came with a specific server to only address the allergies. I'm so impressed by Brittany our server and the entire staff at this location I got to give them an A+ for that.
I will for sure continue to go to this location and ask for Brittany as well. 
Thanks P.F. Chang's for taking allergies so serious! Wish more places would be this way!"}
{"text":"Our office ordered our staff lunch from here. We all ordered off the lunch menu, getting a variety of dishes including chicken,  beef, shrimp,  fried rice,  and egg rolls. 

I got the Kung Pao Shrimp with egg rolls.  Let's begin with the good.  The portion was enough for two meals, although not listed on their online menu,  three lunch favorites comes with a salad with lime vinaigrette. The manager warmly greeted us and thanked us for our patronage. The service was prompt and friendly. 

However, for $11.95 it was a disappointment.  My dish,  while it contained dried chilies,  it served as mere decoration rather than help accentuate the dish.  There was no heat,  not even a kick of spiciness.  The shrimp was over-battered and made the coating spongy instead of crispy. There was maybe 5 slivers of celery.  The shrimp was not large,  maybe 51/60 count. The egg roll could have been great for if it was not dripping in oil. The salad was made up of your typical iceberg mix,  and seemed to be a little over ripe. 

For the price,  I could think of many other treasured hole-in-the-wall, mom and pop,  take-out places I'd rather get Chinese."}
{"text":"One of the only chain restaurants I like. Lunch and dinner have both been delicious."}
{"text":"The one time I went to this restaurant, I was shocked at how high our bill was in the end, and the food was frankly not even that good.  My digestive track can be sensitive at times, and usually the only time food doesn't sit well with me is when I do something stupid like order fast food from McDonald's or Arby's.  I discovered that, for all intents and purposes, PF Chang's food went down just like McDonald's does for me, only it cost me five times as much for the experience."}
{"text":"Waited about 15 minutes for someone to give us menus, and when we ardered and gave is the water, water glasses were dirty with some kind of fruit residue, like they were rinsed in a sink that had lots of cut out fruits. Food was good, hence the 3 stars, still took a long time to get tge check and pay."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's is a people pleaser.  I don't think I've met anyone who doesn't like it.  Food is awesome, for American Chinese.  Ambiance is cool with an Asian Dynasty feel to it.

As for this specific location, we had a great time.  6 of us arrived at peak dinner time with no reservations (we were under the impression they didn't take reservations... note to self) but we were still seated in about 10 minutes.  Everyone took it seriously to find us a table, even amongst all the patrons who had made reservations.  Our server was great, very polite and attentive.  The food of course was great.  My favorites are the chicken lettuce wraps and cashew almond chicken, but the lo-mein, lemon chicken and broccoli beef never disappoint.  The rest of the table loved the ribs as an appetizer and the sea bass as part of the family style entrees.  

Speaking of family style, I always recommend ordering a few dishes for the table to share.  I love having the variety of food and getting to taste a little of everything.  

They have a great date night deal that includes an appetizer, two entrees and dessert.  Their lunch specials are also a good deal with an included soup (egg drop is pretty yummy).  P.F. is great for just about any kind of get together!"}
{"text":"The service was poor, food was less than average and over priced! The dishes were dirty as well as the table, the dinners were made with unequal potions of food ingredients. I came with a party of five. I sent back the plates, mine had crusted food on it, others had grease marks, and they all had hard water stains. Two people in my party ordered the same thing. And one dish was made so different than the other one person sent their food back. The server refused to deal with it, she got the manager to do it. That brings me to the server, she was bad! I had the urge to leave her a penny for a tip she was so bad. She brought one small bowl of brown rice for three people, and even far less white rice for two people, I looked at her and said we need more brown rice, and she said she would bring it out when we needed it, I said no, now. Her service was so bad at all levels, her name was Cam. This was the first time I had been to a P.F. Changs, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service last night 1/28 from Shelbey!! (Name on ticket). We were that big group that was somehow there for about 3 hours celebrating my grandmas birthday lol. The manager came over and was really nice too. I always get the pad Thai and it's so good! The 2 people meal is a great deal because you get so much food for about $42 for 2 people (excluding drinks).

I'm sorry that we forgot to tell you we wanted separate checks, my sister and I were servers and we felt so bad. Shelbey handled it very well and was never frustrated with us and made it happen. Great service!! Love this place"}

{"text":"Little late on my review, I came here a few weeks ago while my cousin was in town for a softball tournament. The food was delicious, I ordered the 2 for 40 with my mom; she got the broccoli beef and I had the spicy chicken. The 2 for 40 came with an appetizer, soup, entrees and one sweet treat. We had their veggie spring rolls, my mom had the egg drop soup and I had the hot and spicy or whatever. We were satisfied with all of it. I also ordered a Long Island and omg, BEST LONG ISLAND I'VE EVER HAD. I wish I took a picture of it, because it was pretty too lol our service was great, we had Zach and he was a fantastic server. This place was delicious and would love to go again."}
{"text":"Their Orange peel shrimp is soooooooooooooo good. I also like the ambience. Good Americanized chinese food :)"}
{"text":"On another trip to this fine restaurant, we were happy to see that the dedication to the customer experience is still in place. We were just off the plane and hungry, and our lunch was delivered very quickly! The manager on duty was checking on tables and greeting customers, and he was not above removing a used plate or two. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the weakest link in Beachwood/Shaker area. The food was bad. They took for ever to bring the food. Also it was all priced too high. Nothing great to say about this place."}
{"text":"We went here for my girlfriends mom's birthday a week or so ago and the service was outstanding. The manager had over heard us talking about how we couldn't believe that mom has never tried hot n sour soup or egg drop soup so he brought out two small samples so she could taste them and see which one she liked. It's those extra things that show a lot about a place. Clearly, they are constantly paying attention to their customers needs and they are doing a great job at overseeing everything that is going on. I wish more places were like this, excellent customer service is hard to come by these days. Way to go PF Chang's!"}
{"text":"WOW! Love this place before, and I love it even more after my recent dining experience. After promptly being sat at a table with a view of Mill Street's finest, we were greeted warmly by our server, Lauren. I was  on the fence about ordering a cocktail, but Lauren suggested trying the Rockin' Berry martini and HOLY COW was it divine. We ordered our usual appetizers, but really wanted to branch out for dinner. Lauren sensed our apprehension and made a few recommendations from the new items on their menu. My date and I went with the Topical Sea Bass and Orange Peel Beef, which were two of the dishes she mentioned. Lauren really had a great attitude, was super friendly and we appreciated that she was always one step ahead. Food is always great, but this kind of service is why we will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Todd the manager and our server Tara were awesome!!! There is mistake on our order but they comp us the wrong order and sent us another full order to go without charging us. Our bill did not reach the 40$ limit for us to use our coupon but they still used it anyways towards our bill.. So basically we had 2 Mongolian beef orders, lemonade, lo mein, calamari, rice, and our banana fried dessert all for 16.09$ u can't beat that and the service is good, Tara kept checking on us, even though we have to wait for awhile with our food it's totally worth it.. I love this of chang's very good service! And Todd is such a good example to their employees by helping them with the orders, cleaning table.. And checking on customers!!! More than 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Five stars.  I was drunk hey I was in Vegas.

I had the chicken lettuce wraps.  So good.  Hubby had Salt and Pepper Calamari I think.  Really yummy too.  It was our first time at PF Changs  

We had a blast thank you!  We were  at the bar the bartenders were great"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.  The food is good, but at this location the service is HORRIFIC!!!  The last 2 times it has taken over 90 minutes to get a lunch.  That is insane. This last visit it took 25 minutes to get a Coke and Tea.  Servers are rude and probably cost them a lot of service.  I really like the food, but I will now have to find a new place.  I gave them a 2nd try, but this serve was the same....Pure disappointment!"}
{"text":"Like every other PF Chang's, it's simply overrated.  Honestly, the food isn't BAD, but no better than some cheap Chinese takeout joints that I've been to. The cost seems to be for atmosphere and fancy dishes. 
  It's okay, but don't listen to all the hype. (That applies to the whole PF Chang's chain, not just this particular location.)"}
{"text":"Summary:
4 Stars for Dine-In
1 Star for Take-out

Dining-in, the food is usually good and the service is acceptable to good depending upon who you get.

The take-out is pretty consistently bad.  I have ordered take-out several times and there has been a dish or two missing out of every order.  If you talk to the staff, they could care less.  I spoke with the manager about it once and he was very apologetic.

The website for handling ordering works really well but the execution for take-out is consistently terrible.  I wish they would fix their take-out issues."}
{"text":"Worst food ever.  You dine in or take out.  They take insanely long time to prepare your order for take out even if it's just a fried rice.  I won't go there ever."}
{"text":"They took an hour for our food, said appetizer would be taken off and then went back on their word at the end. Absolutely trifling behavior for a manager."}
{"text":"First time trying this place, but not impressed with the food , the restaurant experience was good the lighting was pretty legit really romantic setting but when it came to the food it was not $40 worth, for two ppl. Idk what I expected from a chain restaurant. The waitress was awesome but the food was something you can get at the frozen food aisle. Service was good that's why it gets one star but food was a 0 star ."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my food service was excellent I recommend this place for sure. I ordered the honey shrimp and wonton soup it was an excellent taste. As well the fried banana dessert was perfect."}
{"text":"PF Changs is one of the only good Chinese restaurants I've been to in a long time. It's a china bistro so it's nothing like your traditional corner restaurant with the buffet. 

Their food is good but I normally wouldn't come back to eat all the time if it wasn't for the lettuce wraps ::cue the heavenly angel singing::. I love their lettuce wraps and even though I could successfully mimic them at home I don't want to have to go through the mess of all the condiments to make the lettuce wrap sauce ::cue singing again::. 

They also give you the choice between brown rice and white rice. I bet that excites you huh? I know, I just like the idea of being able to go to a Chinese restaurant and eating a light meal that's good for you. Service is good and so is the rest of the food (which is family size portioned) but the only thing that I ever get are the lettuce wraps. They have a choice of chicken or veggie (I prefer the chicken but they are both just as good). I like it. I like it a lot."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was TERRIBLE. Took 20 minutes to get our drinks this included water. It came pretty much with our food. Never checked on, Never received our fortune cookies I only bring this up because the server made a point he would bring them with the check."}
{"text":"PF Chang's, you know I never want to go here, but I inevitably get dragged here by someone else, and its always decent.  They do not have a very wide selection on the menu, but what they do have is good.  Its not authentic Chinese, but it is great for a mid-priced well decorated Chinese chain. I recommend the lettuce wraps, they're the shit, and the Honey Shrimp is pretty damn tasty too.  The honey shrimp reminds me a lot of Chicken McNuggets ( maybe its the way their fried, maybe its their colorartion and shape, or maybe I'm secretly yearning for those mini-paddys of chicken scraps fried in peanut oil and dipped in sweet n sour sauce...either way i digress) and the Honey flavor, so crisp... so sweet...what a treat.  Even if your girlfriend orders them before you, still get them their the best things on the menu.

I got the Moo-Goo Gai Pan, ( becuase I was the last to order and everyone else had already ordered the good shit, and I didn't want to look like a poser, so I orderd, well you know)  and it was a little bland, but they have a delicious \"special\" sauce that our waitress said she made herself, and it helped the flavor out alot.
If you are in the South Park area check out PF Chang's, or if you have a  first date this would be a great place, because the decor and lighting create a feeling of wealth and exclusivity, but the prices are very manageable, and the food is better than average."}
{"text":"I once got a fortune cookie with no fortune in it.

There were two ways to interpret this:

1) I had no fortune (true at the time)
or
2) \"Nothing\"....in bed (also true at the time)."}
{"text":"Is there a way to give 0 stars!? Awful service. It took over 2 hours for a simple entree order and I was almost poisoned after explicitly telling the server I was gluten free. Don't waste your time going to this location."}
{"text":"Very Dissatisfied. I just called to order from the online menu and they don't make what we ordered (3 items)anymore. I understand restaurants change up menus, but please update you site accordingly as well. Additionally, if your going to have someone answer the phone, make sure they know how to talk."}
{"text":"Always great food, but this evening we had excellent service and a fantastic balcony view of the strip. All the dishes came hot and very prompt. Lee did a great job as our waiter/server."}
{"text":"10/22/16 @ 7:40pm. Just went to the restaurant, got seated, and the hostess tells us their gift card and system that tracks the rewards is broken. We got a gift card from a friend and our rewards account includes a free entree.  Screwed both ways.  Very disappointed in this location.  We were there a week ago with my brother and the Mongolian beef was overcooked. Time for a management change?   You may want to go to another location until then. 

11/11/16:  9:00pm.  Women's bathroom has feces on floor tracked all over the bathroom. Health Department should pay them a visit in the evenings.  Guess we will have to go back dining at Red Robin. They don't have these issues."}
{"text":"I'm partial to P.F. Chang's, and have dined at several of their locations, so this review might seem biased.  This is my first dinner at the Planet Hollywood location.   It's great!   This chain's menu is consistent, and their managers are equally consistent, so the food is reliably very good.   I was worried that a casino location might have a bit of a \"feed the masses in a hurry\" formula, but I was wrong.   There was a brief wait, so we took advantage of the busy, but friendly bar.   Once our dinner table was available, our server, Jeremy, was a skilled, friendly, professional guy who was a delight.   The food was excellent, and we will make this a \"must do\" on future treks to Vegas."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, which I do perhaps 7-8 days each month. At 1pm, with lots of open tables, they couldn't seat me. Looks like they are having staffing problems. I also have recently experienced inconsistent preparations of the meal, sometimes it is as if a trainee cook prepared the food. So, today, zero stars, but overall two. The food for  lunch is overpriced for the quality, but typically acceptable. I eat at the PF Changs in Asheville regularly as well and find that to be a much better restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here several times & the food is great! Love the chicken lettuce wraps & the shrimp w/ candied walnuts.  Some of my favs! Atmosphere is good. I think a little more lighting would be better though.  The booths are pretty big too.  All of the times I've been there we've had great service."}
{"text":"I am always a fan of PF Chang's, but the one in Las Vegas had a special menu where large groups can order by paying per person and get unlimited appetizers and entrees,  I think we paid $27pp and got two appetizers and 4 entrees along with white and brown rice.  If we ran out of anything, they would bring out more.  The food was good and the service was excellent.  The only downside was the excruciatingly long wait.  They said 45 minutes, but it ended up being a hour and a half!"}
{"text":"The food and service are acceptable. The new prices, particularly for the bottled beer are not. We ate here 3-4 times per week but now that bottled beer is $6 for beer that retails at $1 or less per bottle in the package stores we have decided to go elsewhere. The restaurant Ah So about 50 feet from Changs has Sierra Nevada on tap for $3, a larger portion for less than half the price. The food is very good...so...guess where we are now going to be 3-4 times per week."}
{"text":"This was a really good dining experience. The food was quite good - sampled several appetizers as well as fried rice, lo mien, and s couple of other people's entrees that I don't remember the name of. It was all good. But the service was extraordinary - our waiter, who I believe was named Kevin, was charming and attentive and fun. It was a good choice for our group and I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times. Definitely would suggest their signature lettuce wrap appetizer. Service can be spotty - on good days, they're really attentive and great in general. But when they're busy, you're just lost in the masses. But you're here for the food, food quality is great. (Although in my opinion, some dishes can verge on the more saltier side) Also, my favorites are their dessert section, especially their minis (tiramisu mini is amazing!)."}
{"text":"Disappointing service for Valentine's day today. We arrived exactly on time for our reservation and were told that they are a half hour late.  Now we continue to wait over 50 minutes. Very sad to misstate it after we arrived. Standing room only. If we were a 50 min late they would have given our spot away. Maybe they thought it was necessary to overbook because all of the people that they are turning away couldn't fill a few unreserved tables? No it's just bad management. I just went up to the hostess stand wad she said your next after 1 other. Then they seated two other groups of our size (2).  So our punishment for complaining was to sit us in front of the kitchen door."}
{"text":"Needed something a little different and this hit the spot. One of the reasons I like PF Changs is that it's consistent. No matter where in the country you are it tastes the same as the one where you live and it's always fresh."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants hands down. I eat at PF Changs often and the atmosphere in this location is very different from what I am used to in Texas. It is never really busy which provides a great non rushed dining experience.  I am a fan of their calamari as an appetizer and their Mongolian beef for an entree.  These two items never dissapoint.  The last server suggested I try asparagus as an addition to the Mongolian beef...it was OK but prefer the classic."}
{"text":"Give them a try again. I have been a customer here many times. Previously it has been very inconsistent. We visited them Wednesday 11.1.17 for dinner and it was excellent. Complimented both the server and manager. After talking with the manager he told us that the new management company took it over 9 months ago and have been trying to solve many of the problems. In my opinion there succeeding. Give them a try again."}
{"text":"I think this is store #2 in the Chang's family (Tempe).  Paul Flemming had a good idea back in the early 90s and its come to be what to expect in mid-level Chinese...but as with most restaurants there is a level of obsolescence that has touched this chain.  Its still a great go-to for meeting up but there are a lot better options out there."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious, the manager is very considerate. This is usually our go to restaurant when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We were helped by Tony R.  Great personality and personable.  He also provided very good customer service.  One person in our group has severe nut allergies and Tony made a point of ensuring that the sushi was all good. 
The food was fresh and tasty.  We ordered sushi, spring rolls, stir fry filet mignon and vegetable fried rice.  All good choices.
Tony made sure I didn't miss the end of happy hour and also kept our water glasses full.  
We recommend this place when you are at Planet Hollywood and looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and got terrific service from Nicole (Bartender) and Travis (Server) made my bday experience one to remember-)"}
{"text":"Two words:  Painfully Mediocre

Imagine your favorite and/or average Chinese food delivery place.

Now divide the flavor in half.

Now multiply the price by 3.

Perfect, now find a place that isn't PF Chang's to eat tonight.

Seriously though, you are paying for mediocre food in a \"trendy\" environment.  Trendy is another way of saying \"long wait\" and \"stupid employees\".  The Olive Garden : Italian food :: PF Chang's : Chinese food analogy doesn't even work here.  And I make fun of Olive Garden ALL the time.

If you are really determined to get mediocre Chinese food, find a Pei Wei.  It's owned by the same family and is the same food but for less.  And if you're looking for a Pei Wei in Tempe, AZ, just go to Tott's Asian Diner.  It's in the same strip mall and it's way way better."}
{"text":"This particular PF Chang's is one of the best I have been to. They are always on time, food is very predictable and the employees are friendly and good customer service. Best one in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"OK I will start with the good parts of this place. The Hostess was sweet. She even helped us with the Validation of the parking.
The Lettuce wraps were good. That is where it ends.
I can honestly say, we will never come here again for any reason. Nor would I ever encourage anyone to eat here.

What has happened to P.F. Chang's???  I mean honestly!
We were greeted by the hostess who put us at a nice table by the window.
After sitting down I could see the table was dirty. There was grease all over it and I had a dirty plate in my area.
When Kinnesy came to tell us she would be helping us out tonight. I asked if we could get the table wiped down and I showed her the grease all over it.
She did come back and wipe it down,then disappeared, in her place came over a male server, who then told us he would be taking care of us instead.

He seemed good at first. He told us about a few things on the menu. 
I got hot Tea and my friend got Ice Tea, they had Mango and regular. 
He ordered regular.
About an hour later he had to ask for another Ice Tea, he got it but, it was Mango.
We got the 2 for $40.00, which does not include your drinks.
It came with soup. 
Somewhere after we received the lettuce wraps things went downhill.
We never got any appetizer plates. We had to ask for them.
That is OK because, things like that can happen.
Then another server brought us out our main dishes. 2 meals one bowl of white rice. We had both ordered Brown rice. Again no Dinner plates.
We had to ask for those as well.
We never even got any water to drink.
I have to say in all the time we sat there waiting for everything, I really noticed how dirty the floor was.  They would just wipe the floors down and paper ,rice, food, everything right on to the floor.

They were not even busy here, there were 11 tables occupied ours being one of them. There were 5 servers.
We waited and Waited, and waited for the dessert to come out. I really wanted it to go at this point we had been there for 1 and half hours. I was so ready to go.
It was a simple meal that took forever.
The hostess had to go to find the waiter to tell him we wanted our check. I could see him in the doorway of the Kitchen eating.
Just give us our dessert and check and we will be out of here like 25 min ago.
The dessert were Wontons that had been micro waved. They were hard and the mixture inside was bubbling. Gross!
We waited so long that we finally just left the $$$ on the Table and left.
I have to say it was my very worst dining experience."}
{"text":"Hadn't been in a few years, and was disappointed to find that the food has gone a bit downhill.

Lettuce wraps were as delicious as we remembered, but there was very little chicken mix compared to the amount of lettuce leaves we received. Additionally, our waitress did not offer us a level of sweet to spiciness for the dipping sauce, an aspect we remember well from past visits - yet the waiter serving the tables next to us offered his tables the choices for a custom dipping sauce mix.

Cocktails were watery and sugary, very little alcohol. The salmon was a bit off, and the filet mignon (a stretch to call it that...I'd just say beef...) was tough and flavorless. The highlights of the night were the arctic cod, and the eggplant."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and were not disappointed.   Everything from the service to the food was excellent.   I had the Honey Crisp Shrimp and my husband had the Mongolian Beef with soup.  Both dishes were excellent.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went here for our 7th anniversary dinner. They had an awesome prix fix menu that included soup, appetizer, main course and dessert for only $44.95. What a deal for two people. The service was fine, even though it was packed. We were able to get a table on the heated patio immediately with our reservations. Great place to go for good food."}
{"text":"Solid three stars for my lunch here last Monday afternoon. 

I have to admit I am a PF Changs fan and connoisseur. I have been coming to this restaurant since I was in high school and I should have stuck with my tried and true dishes: Crispy Honey Shrimp, Green Beans and Lettuce Wraps. 

Since it was lunch we went with the lunch bowl menu. The prices were very cheap, about $9 or so and it came with soup and either white or brown rice. I got the Honey Chicken and it was just okay. The egg drop soup I liked much more than the Hot & Sour. The service was very slow. We were there at about 2pm, so I think thats after lunch rush, but they seemed to be very understaffed for how many people were there. Overall, food was just okay, but the price was right! Next time back to my favorite dishes."}
{"text":"Unless you're with a big crowd and ordering a lot of food and drinks then be prepared to be treated like a burden. There was hardly anyone there and the service was so slow. The waitress deliberately made me feel like a nuisance because of my dairy allergy. Everything we asked for took a very long time and we really just felt like we didn't want to be there.  I asked the waitress if there was dairy in a drink and getting her to find out if there was any was like pulling teeth. The food was fine but the service made us feel so unwanted that it deserves a one star rating."}
{"text":"This location specifically disappointed me with their service. The restaurant was practically empty and we were seated right away but for some odd reason It took forever to get a waiter to take our order and an even longer time (about an hour) to get our food. 

Finally when we did get our food It was tasty just took wayyyy too long for a place with only four tables filled. Just looked like the waiters were lost and hard to get their attention when we needed something."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the management.  The food is also very good always. The location is perfect. I've been coming here for a few years now. It has definitely improved over time. Curbside pickup is on point....A+."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I'm use to a good taste meals , we ordered wonton sup and it was really plain taste let use wrap was bad also I won't try this place again"}
{"text":"I was a little buzzed when i was at the restaurant with my friends but i remember a good amount of my experience here.

The waitress was a little rude and seemed like she couldn't wait to get off work. I asked her about a the fried tofu to see if it was vegan and she just said no without any explanation or suggestions of any alternatives that are vegan. One of my friends wanted to know why it wasn't vegan so i asked and she replied with \"because of the sugar.\" i looked at her confused and asked what she meant because sugar comes from sugar cane, a plant. she responded with a very condescending attitude as if i were stupid and said that the sugar came from animal bone. (Later on I looked up on my phone what she was talking about and they actually do use ingredients that are derived from bone char... gross) By this point i got really frustrated and changed my order to the buddha's feast which was truly vegan. The wait for our food was ridiculously long and i am not exaggerating because i had been drinking. My friends can also confirm that it took forever to receive our food. We were actually in a hurry to meet up with a friend to get into a club. Once the food arrived it was alright but it was literally steamed vegetables with small slices of tofu mixed in. I got bored of this very easily also. I had to order two sides of rice because steamed vegetables would not be enough for a long night of drinking and dancing..

Try something else on the strip, you can get p f chang's anywhere! I didn't find it to be anything special."}
{"text":"The food is terrible. Rice was half cooked. The green bean was so salty that we had to dip each one of them in the water to eat. And don't even try the sesame chicken. I don't even recognize this dish. This the worst Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. Please don't go."}
{"text":"Usually my husband and I like to have date night here. Last night my daughter and mom came with us.  I always have a grey goose cosmo, yummy. We had the ahi appetizer, lettuce wraps and hot-n-sour soup (my husbands favorite).  Everything came timely and perfect.  Entrees were szechuan shrimp,Chinese BBQ spareribs (my favorite), sweet-n-sour chicken and almond chicken.  We ordered too much again...  Oh well, lunch leftover tomorrow.  Our waiter was great, food great, atmosphere great.  Another happy experience at Pf Changs.  Forgot we had the combo fried rice too."}
{"text":"Had a good 'team dinner' at P.F. Chang's last night.  

You know what you are getting when you come to any PF Chang's, which is to say, they seem to be pretty uniform from location to location.

This, for the most part, is a good thing.  What is variable is the service.

Last night our waitress wasn't quite up to par - she mistakenly gave me honey chicken instead of honey shrimp.  Rather than send it back, I took one for the team, and just enjoyed the chicken.  The food was very good, which would have merited a 4-star experience, but the service was lacking (beyond just the order mix-up).  

I tend not to make a stink over these kinds of things, unless the food is truly bad, I can't/don't eat what is served, or there is some other functional problem.

Their crab rangoon was quite good.

For some reason, however, this location was not coming up on my mobile app - not sure why that is!"}
{"text":"It was a nice experience :
Good service, good food, nice ambient, and relatively affordable :)"}
{"text":"We completed an online order and picked it up.   Very fresh and the food was amazing. The wait staff was super friendly.   Still wished they had the lemon chicken but we still found something for 6 people to eat with leftovers.  They even gave us plates and silverware.   Loved the carryout experience."}
{"text":"Went to Have lunch with my husband and our server did not attend us very well. He took like 6 min to get to out table to get our drink order. After we order he only checked on us once when we got our good, when we were done eating we asked for boxes to go.He didn't even ask if we wanted dessert or if he could get us anything else. Wasn't too happy with the service at all."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Chicken Satay appetizer comes with 3 (count 'em. 3) and they were small and not good. When our food finally arrived after a long wait (over a half hour) my sister's ribs were cold. I ordered the lettuce wraps for my main dish and the lettuce was all wilted. For lunch for 3 people at $85, I certainly expect more. Not good"}
{"text":"I have been to several PF Chang's locations, and this one 3-4 times while traveling for business. My experience here has been the standard positive PF Chang's experience. Located inside Planet Hollywood towards the very front of the casino. 

PF Chang's as you likely know is a large semi upscale Chinese chain. Some people just don't like chains. I personally have no issues with chains that have consistently good food and service. To me, PF Chang's fits the category of good and consistent. Is it the best ever?  Probably not. But I find it reliable and quite tasty. 

I love their crab Rangoon. Way better than most local Chinese places as PF Chang's actually uses more crab than cream cheese. I also like their version of shrimp with lobster sauce as well as salt and pepper prawns. The Chang's spicy chicken and sesame chicken is also always a hit with the family. My two daughters love their dumplings. 

Having the choice of white or brown rice is always nice. And if you want to try their fried rice the combination fried rice is pretty darn good. 

Yes, PF Chang's cost more than your typical local joint, but sometimes if you don't have a good referral, you are taking a chance with a local place. For consistency sake and the high quality, PF Chang's is tough to beat."}
{"text":"I used to love PF chang's... \"Fancy\"
Chinese food for a reasonable price. 

As all good things do, this apparently has come to an end. I've held off on a review for years but considering my last 3 visits have been horrible, it's time to call it quits.

One of my go-to's has always been the chicken lettuce wraps. I'm not 100% sure how they are prepared, but someone needs to teach the cooks how to remove tendons from the meat. Nothing ruins the meal quicker then that ONE bite that is inedible.

Service during these three visits has been forgettable as well, especially during the lunch crowd.

Only saving grace for them is their deep fried banana dessert. Otherwise, stick to your local Chinese takeout place."}
{"text":"We go here quite often and the service and food is always very good. My wife likes to get the dinner for two which includes an appetizer soup dinner and dessert because for $40 deal can't be beat at a place like this.

I would suggest trying the beef with broccoli and sweet and sour soup both of those are my favorites. 

This time I had one of the new salads, The vietnamese one one I believe. It was a lot of salad I don't really recommend this one.
 
Overall a really fun place!"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten yet, but ordered a mojito from the bar and it was really bad. Too much simple syrup and only 2 small bar-slices of lime. I had to pour in a whole tall glass of soda water to make it drinkable. When the hostess brought us to the table it was obvious that it hadn't been wiped down. We just ordered. May have an update later.
OK, just finished the meal. Mongolian Beef was good, my chicken dish was also too sweet and the vegetables were so over-cooked that they were mush. Rice was hard on top like it had been put in the single serving bowl over an hour prior to being brought to our table. Garlic-chile noodles were just OK. Not a single piece of fresh garlic or red chile flakes even though we asked for extra spicy. And even that dish was slightly sweet!   What is with all the sugary sweet sauces in this place?  
Check for 2 with 2 cocktails and tip was around $75.  I could have had 2-3 great meals at my regular place for Chinese (see my other reviews) - oh well, lesson learned."}
{"text":"Came in early for the happy hour, nothing special except the sweet, well spoken waitress.  Even when the food is average, the waitstaff can make a difference.

If you sit at the bar, request Shannon.  She knows the menu very well and will take good care of you.  

I tried the Ahi appitizer and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I was staying in Arizona for a week while I was attending the Arizona Debate Institute held at ASU. 

I went to a local restaurant (pf changs, right on mill) to do some work and de-stress. 

The day was a pretty tough one for me, it was the anniversary of my mothers death. We used to always eat at pf changs together. 

I ordered our favorite, lettuce wraps. They ended up bringing me veggie lettuce wraps instead of chicken, but it was so damn good I didn't even notice!!!! Next think I know the waiter brings out the chicken lettuce wraps, and let's me keep the veggie ones. 

Moral of the story, it was nice to be sitting there with two plates of food. Made me feel like my mom was there in a way. I probably wouldn't have ordered anything else, so wouldn't have had that feeling if they didn't \"goof up\" my order. Little did they know they made my day. 

The service was amazing. : ) definitely a must in Tempe."}
{"text":"I hope the GM of this place sees this review so our server can get some recognition.

Our server's name was Chaz.

My dad and I walked in last night (12/17/2014) around 7:15 p.m in a bit of a hurry. I hadn't seen my dad in a while and ha carved out a little time between work and a late final, so we decided to go to dinner. We told the hostess we were in somewhat I a hurry, and Chaz did everything in his power to get things out on time. We frequent this place often so we already knew what we wanted when we sat down and he put the order in promptly. 
Our dinner was delivered quickly and Chaz kept our drinks full. He was so sweet and even though we were in a bit of a time crunch we enjoyed our time together thoroughly because Chaz just kept things coming quickly and thoroughly. He was such a nice guy and a wonderful server, I hope he gets the recognition he deserves! Thank you Chaz!
-Rebecca"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go to this PF Chang's. What a huge disappointment that was. I would rate our server a higher rate, because he was good. I ordered the lo mein when I received it and was super salty. My husband ordered the Kung Pao shrimp with no peanuts and ended up getting a completely different order. I told my server that my meal was salty and he said that Asian food is salty, I told him no it's not I am Asian. He offered to have it made with less sauce. So if you want less salty on your meal ask for Less sauce. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here yesterday and were served and entertained by our waiter, Chaz. He was very attentive and friendly and made us feel welcome. The food was great as always and we will certainly we returning. Thanks Chaz!!"}

When we arrived, there were MAYBE 10 tables occupied.  3 bartenders, and 10 servers.

Took 10 minutes after my first drink was empty to get another one and I had to flag the bartender down.

Food was good(that's expected), but took 25 minutes to get an order of orange peel beef and honey walnut shrimp.

I thought San Diego had a lock on snooty, self-absorbed waitstaff, but P.F. Chang's Las Vegas has them beat by far.

Will never be back."}
{"text":"This was my second time going to PF Chang's although I know it's been in town for years.  The lunch menu is inexpensive, has tons of options and comes with salad or soup.  What I have been most impressed with is their wait staff.  The first time we had a very hospitable blond southern girl and the second was a (I think) southern guy with weird earrings.  These were two of the best waiters I've had in a LONG time.  They were unbelievably good.  They're a big factor in why I'll be coming back for awhile.
This makes me want to travel to the South."}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:30 pm on a Friday and the place was PACKED.  Now we know why.  Amazing food, amazing service and just a fantastic overall experience.  The dumplings and the Korean BBQ chicken were phenomenal and the sesame chicken was the best I've ever had!  It's definitely in our repertoire."}
{"text":"Love the food and the happy hour where you can experiment and try several dishes, sort of a Spanish tapa restaurant. Chicken lettuce wraps are always a winner!

Great decor, cozy, reasonable prices ... BUT a consistently uncaring, careless almost arrogant service all three times I've been here. And the wait staff isn't young and inexperience so I'm at a loss why they can't be more customer-service oriented.

Shucks. Love the food, so maybe take-out is the way to go or just avoid this location."}
{"text":"I haven't thought I would share a bad experience ever with P.F.Changs which is one of my favorite places to dine in. We started off with Butternut squash dumplings which we tried for the first time and felt it was a below average one. Then ordered the Sichuan Chili-Garlic Chicken from holiday menu which says THINLY sliced chicken but came out to be a large 3 piece fried chicken with some toppings and they were out of fried rice at 8:30PM on a Friday evening.I just touched the dish and left it all completely disappointed. Next is the garlic noodles, which has a good flavor but why are my noodles made in lumps stuck altogether. Half my bowl was like that, and how can someone can't get the basics right in preparing noodles. Completely disappointed to travel 30 miles for this place and ruining my holiday evening."}
{"text":"Stars are for the food only.    2.5 rating

Got there at 8pm on Saturday night, they told us it was an hour wait which was expected, but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus.  Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(FYI-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  I had the Singapore rice noodles.  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. 

The service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.  I found it rude especially since  there wasn't even a line at this point.  

I think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  The result never quite met the anticipation."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. It has a nice decor with painted glass panels on the back wall which are actually  the wall between the dining and restroom. We  tried a variety  of things. The black tea tasted odd, I am not sure why, but I  didn't  care for it. The peach bellini was tasty.  The wonton soup.was good, with chunks of chicken, spinach, shrimp and water chestnuts besides the wontons. We ordered the traditional style egg rolls,  not having had them in a long time, it comes with a sauce which is basically  sweet and sour mixed with Chinese mustard.  If you do not like mustard  they will bring you sweet and sour alone. We ordered  fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and Mongolian beef. The portions are smaller and more expensive  than a good family owned Chinese. Restaurant. For $17.95 I  was a bit surprised to see about 4-6 oz of bite size pieces of beef and it was not tender, it was somewhat  chewy. We didn't  finish all our food but the waiter pushed the dessert  menu not once but twice! I feel it is badgering  if I  have already  said I don't  want dessert to keep pushing me! I will stick to my couple favorite family owned  Chinese restaurants!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Tried other food but I had the Sesame chicken And definitely is one of the best I had. Prices was Very reasonable compared to other restaurants around. Our waitress this was outstanding! Don't remember her name but she was asian girl with short hair. Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been to this location multiple times but this time it was a horrible service. Manager needs to understand we pay for an experience and the food. Both the things were lacking. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"It was boring. Staff eas annoyed to wait on a large party. Food was bad. Dry meats, mushy rice. Pellegrino was good and the glass was clean."}
{"text":"The new lunch bowls are A M A Z I N G Definitely going back for one. Also LOVE their Moscow Mules. However the service was really bad. Took forever for someone to even come to our table to take our order and then the food took forever to come which I don't understand cause it was 1pm and empty"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and friendly service. I like the gluten free menu."}
{"text":"Always consistently fabulous both the food  & service! Great Gluten-Free menu ! Great atmosphere and ever changing menu !

Big winner!"}
{"text":"New fav's besides the same awesome crew... let's talk food & under 600 calories... to start Edamame w/ Lime, then Spicy Chicken Soup, love the noodles!  Ginger Chicken & Broccoli w/ brown rice & since I love spicy, I order the Ring of Fire hot sauce.  Mmm mmm on everything.  

If you're not watching your figure, the combination fried rice is a new fav of ours too.  

Love the Citrus Spice tea & for alcoholic beverages, my own concoction Absolut Wild Tea & Vanilla w/ club soda.  

The cheesecake & lava cake are delish also."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on a business trip with 3 fellow workers and we were checking out the Tempe area since it was close to our hotel. 

We decided to eat here because one of our group has eat at one before and enjoyed it. 

We had a dear waitress that new how to flirt just enough with everyone for the good tip, very nice service! 

We ordered 4 orders of egg rolls for starters and they were the best I have ever eat. My wife is Asian so I know good egg rolls because hers is very very good too. 

I ordered the cashew and almonds chicken, I am sorry to say it was just very avarage.  Not very good chinese food other than the egg rolls."}
{"text":"This was our second trip to P.F. Chang's and it will probably be our last. Both times we had problems with rice. I guess rice isn't their strong point. This isn't too hot for a Chinese restaurant.

We ordered some spring rolls and dumplings for apps. The dumplings were great, the best part of the meal, honestly. But at $3.25 for 3, they're quite expensive for literally, one bite. They were quite good, though. Minced pork, shrimp and water chestnuts in a deliciously chewy translucent wonton wrapper. Very tasty.

We also got the spring rolls. They were pretty boring and dripping with oil. It looks like the cook just took them out of the fryer and sat them in a pile of other fried things, soaking up the oil.

When they serve the apps, they give you a plethora of dipping sauces...dumpling sauce, sambal (hot sauce), hot mustard plus sesame oil, soy sauce and vinegar. The spring rolls also came with a sweet and sour sauce. I like sauces, so this was a plus. The bottle with the sesame oil was coated in the oil, though. So your hands got all greasy every time you used it. They probably should have wiped down the bottle after refilling it.

For our entrees, we got the pork lo mein and almond chicken. The almond chicken was tasty. It had plenty of veggies in it, almonds and cashews and lots of white meat chicken. The lo mein was okay, but they used speghetti instead of lo mein...and it was overcooked.

Remember how I said they had problems with the rice? The last time we came here, we ordered several dishes. After everything was on the table, our waiter disappered for about fifteen minutes. He had never brought us our rice. So we sat and ate everything, sans rice, until he came back to check on us. I told him everything was very nice....we just had no rice to eat our meals with. He said \"Oh you wanted rice?\"

Of course we wanted rice, thats why we came to a Chinese restaurant. We got the rest of our food boxed up and the waiter didn't give us a container of rice. What's the deal with the rice?

Our visit the other day...we ended up getting crunchy rice. We asked for another serving of rice and all they did was get the same crunchy stuff from the same rice cooker. Cooking rice isn't rocket science and a Chinese restaurant should be able to get it right. 

My biggest complaint is the price. The entrees are roughly twice what they would be from pretty much any Chinese joint in the city. Our meal the other day for 2 small apps and 2 entrees was $35. We could have easily gotten twice as much food as a normal Chinese restaurant. And honestly, the quality would have been better. I filled out a survey from the receipt and received a reply from their manager the next day. He apologized and offered me a free appetizer. Unfortunately, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant just got even better!
They just added free Wi-Fi in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst customer service & waited over an hour for a take out order. I said hi to the manager as she rudely walked by & never even smiled or not even a hello. Staff looked angry except for the guy & girl doing take out orders. After I finally got me food I sat and waited another 10 minutes for my change. My sushi was warm & couldnt eat it by the time I got home."}
{"text":"Ordered the bimbap,it was decent but I think it's funny PF Chang's in general should be Chinese influenced but we have some Korean dishes and then our table also ordered sushi which is Japanese .. we ordered two rolls (not pictured).. the fish was not fresh and the rice was really hard making hard to chew... Don't expect much from the food here but our waitress was very nice and on top of the refills and checking up on us!"}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of PF Chang's, and had been to this location before. This time was such a disappointment. Went here for lunch with my mom and two sons. Our food was soggy, my son never got his side, and the waiter never checked on us after our food was delivered. Asked the host (who was wonderful) if I could speak to the manager. The manager came out, never introduced himself, seemed disingenuous while hearing my complaints. He got the fruit, making it seem like that was the only problem, and comped our entire meal. That's not what we were after. The waiter made it clear he was upset with us when he dropped off our fortune cookies and said \"that's it I guess.\" We left a tip and got out of there as fast as we could. I've worked in the food industry for years and know the only way to fix problems are to address them and that was my intention when asking for the manager. He handled the situation poorly and we will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"These guys were soo busy but yet managed to get the food out quickly. We got dynamite shrimp which was awesome as usual and I got the Chicken Pad Thai which was good as usual. It was one of our friend's b'day and one's farewell party so we got a round of tequilla shots, man did she fill those shot glasses. :)"}
{"text":"I usually avoid chain restaurants, but I have a weakness for Chang's. At least they started in Scottsdale, so it is a home-town company. This location is a little different than others and I really appreciate it. There are fabulous touches like the glass wall mural that really step the place up. 

The food is consistently great and the service staff are always friendly. I'm currently hooked on a sweet dish I never would have considered from the menu - its shrimp, honeydew melon and walnuts and is absolutely delicious. Every person I go there with looks at me questioningly, then thanks me for ordering it because they never would have. Sweet isn't your thing? Try the fabulously spicy Bloody Mary to really really kick-up your night.

Yum!

UPDATE: New management = less consistent quality and service. However, even though its a Chinese chain, they have one of the best margaritas I've had anywhere in Arizona. Go figure."}
{"text":"I don't mind driving 35 minutes to get there. I just love this place. I usually go Saturday night and the restaurant is always busy. Workers are friendly. I always order my favorite dessert... Banana Spring Rolls. The coconut-pineaple ice cream is to die for!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night and have been here quite a few times. I cannot believe people here reviewing are saying it is overpriced. Really? Where else can you go and for 2 people get soup, appetizer, 2 entrees, rice and dessert for $39. That is a 4 course meal.  Am I missing something here? This is a damn steal! If you think that is \"overpriced\" then go to Chili's or Applebees and eat that garbage! PF Changs has amazing Asian cuisine that is superb, full of flavor and well worth the price. We had very fast and courteous service last night as well, and every time I have ever went I have never had any issues with the service. 

My fave dishes/apps are Mongolian Beef, Kung Pao Chicken and Orange chicken, Lettuce wraps and Chicken chow mein. I haven't tried everything so I am sure there is more awesomeness to eat there as well. I do not eat fish so can't really speak on that.

If you want to upgrade your dessert for $1.95, Try the Banana spring rolls. Its fried banana with pineapple coconut ice cream with vanilla and caramel sauce and fruit! Amazing! I love PF Changs. Cant wait to eat my leftovers for lunch today."}
{"text":"Really underwhelmed by my last visit with my husband at the Mill Ave location. Our waiter was so terrible that management tried to step in to fix it; as it turns out, there were many others facing a similar issue and then we had poor service from the MANAGER too! What a joke! If your service is going to be subpar, you need to lowest pricing for happy hour, OR higher better staff. Or both!!"}
{"text":"This is not a review on the food I think the food at PF Changs is pretty standard it's delicious and the same everywhere. However this particular location has huge organizational issues that I blame purely on management.  First I made a reservation specifically stating  4 adults two children with high chairs. Our party arrived 10 minutes early and yet we're still seated after 40 minutes. Our food was brought out in three separate segments for three different people. In an hour time span. We had a table party of five who were eating their dinner wrapped up and left sitting next to us. Another party of five came sat down, ordered their food had their dinner, even had it wrapped up and my husbands entrée still had not arrived just to give you an idea of the time span. at this point with two toddlers and after 2 1/2 hour time at the table they were getting pretty rowdy it was never our intention to be there that long a child's patience can only last for so long. The server was always polite and courteous the entire time constantly apologizing. After we paid for our dinner my husband asked to speak with management and this is the fundamental issue, my husband explained the entire situation to him the manager simply replied that they had a lot of new staff new cooks, even an excuse saying they had so many takeout orders etc. etc. he offered my husband to comp the appetizer, when he declined that he offered my husband a $25 gift card, which my husband told him we have already paid it's not the money that's the issue. He declined the gift card because he simply said there's no reason to return. My husband was extremely polite and courteous even gave him a handshake. The issue is that the entire time the manager did not once offer an apology. All we were looking for was an apology I don't know where it is that they really need to work on their organization and delivery. We are very reasonable people we understand that there are bad days we don't blame our server but I do blame the management it's their job to assure that things are running smoothly and executed properly. This chain has such a high customer turn out that I guess if they lose a few customers it makes no effect on their profit margin. I don't think we will be returning to this particular location anytime soon we never had a problem with the location in Fairlawn we live in between both so it's very easy to drive south versus north for us."}
{"text":"I like the food, the size is enough for family sharing, i would recommend this place to my friends who visiting US, PF Chang has many chain around state in US"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! I will say its pretty expensive but yummy yum! If you go you MUST have the crispy green beans! This is my favorite thing on the menu! I cane at the entire plate by myself and i want more after. I crave them all the time! I also love the kung pao scallops! wow are thoseee good!
I did have this very sweet chicken which i did not like at all.
But everything else i've ever had was really good."}
{"text":"My last visit to P.F. Chang's was my best so far. This restaurant just gets better every time I visit (I initially rated it two stars). Normally this is not the type of food that I enjoy as the sauces they use don't really mesh with my taste buds, but I am pleasantly surprised more and more by the food when I go here. I have now come around to enjoy the lettuce wraps and the crab wontons are pretty awesome too! I also really liked the seabass that I ordered as my main entree on one of my more recent visits.

P.F. Chang's is making an unlikely fan out of me!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Justine always takes great care of us, and food always comes out within 30 minutes. Only once did the food take almost an hour but that was when the restaurant was literally filled to capacity (understandable). We will always come back and we will always ask for Justine!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and the food was good. We were party of four but our server gave us only two sets of utensils. He was not happy and not polite either. We got our food but two of us were still waiting for the utensils to eat."}
{"text":"Worst PF Changs service ever. We were a party of six. Our server struck me as phony but I figured I'd give him a chance. We ordered appetizers, soup and 6 entrees. Five entrees came out. The sixth entree took an extra 20-30 minutes. Basically, it arrived after every other person in our party was finished. When it finally came out I was no longer wanting to eat it. He did comp the meal and apologized for the delay, prefacing it by saying he wanted only the best for me. Nothing is worst to me than ingenuity with poor service, and not being able to eat with the rest of your group. Stay away."}
{"text":"PF Changs is yummy in the tummy at all the locations. The service is always good the ambience is sophisticated. This is my fave Asian chain. The location on West McDowell has the best most attentive staff I have had so far in the valley & one in Cali. The reverse happy hour specials are the best bang for your buck. If you've feeling casual & want a quickie late night bite hit the bar. The bartender is a breath of fresh air. She remembers your face after weeks & is always speedy. She's very approachable & nice to chat it up with. I really shockingly like the spicy green beans that have hit the menu & the streetfare menu is really good & worth every calorie. The Asian street tacos are great. Really enjoyed the spicey shrimp tacos & the traditional beef. The meats were succulent & the spices perfecto. Mmm mmm good."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. My wife and I were greeted and seated very fast. There are plenty of options to choose from and their servers are very informative. The food tasted really good. I'm not sure why some are saying that this place is dirty because when my wife and I were there everything seemed pretty clean."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service. However, we were among the first to arrive at 11am and it wasn't yet busy but took sooooo long to get out food, or food boxed, our check, and then out check & card returned. We were only 3 people and it took almost 90 minutes. We had No special orders or requests."}
{"text":"Last couple of visits to P.F. Chang's in Goodyear were mediocre at best.  The establishment is ARTIC.  Despite informing management the dining area is so cold it's uncomfortable, nothing permanently changes.  Management acted put out and turned the AC off for a short time, it was cranked back up again in minutes.  My follow-up visit was so cold it was not enjoyable again.  This happened during Fall and Winter weather.  

Staff is fine; they take care of business but that's it, it's nothing to remember or really enjoy.  I think I'm done with this location.  It's a new area and already a mess."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. My husband and I wanted to go back to the same restaurant we had our first date while celebrating our anniversary in Vegas and we went to the PF Chang's on the strip  the wait was ridiculous, we pulled up the next closest one and it was just 3 mins away from where we were so we came here. The service was wonderful and our waiter was awesome. There was no wait, same great food and more romantic verse all the commotion at the other location. We enjoyed our last night in Vegas with a really relaxed dinner. I'd come back here again next time I'm in Vegas again instead of the crowded one on the strip. My husband loved it so did I."}
{"text":"Just had yet another fantastic lunch at PF Changs on the Strip in Vegas!  Drinks for me and the harried mom of three = fabulous!  Kids loved the chicken and noodles.  Grandpa Marc is chillin' and well-fed.  Shout out to Sergio who provided EXCELLENT customer service!  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I normally order all different dishes when i go there because i know i will most likely like it.  I love their hot and sour soup and their chicken lettuce wraps.  It's really close to my work, so it's easy to just walk over and eat lunch there with a co-worker.   But i will say that they ask you how everything is a little too often.  But overall service is great."}
{"text":"By far my favorite chinese restaurant! The food is always fresh. So flavorful. My hubby's favorite is the Walnut Shrimp with melon. Hot shrimp with cool melon balls in a sweet honey mustard. He loves it!! This time, Matt was our waiter, ask for him, great customer service, excellent conversationist."}
{"text":"Reasonably good, but mediocre by normal PF Changs standards. Service is pretty bad. ambiance not up to their usual standards."}
{"text":"My first time eating at a P.F. Chang's so I don't really have anything to compare this location to.  I can say that I did enjoy my meal as well as the atmosphere.  Will return!"}
{"text":"it's pf Chang's OK food OK service at a higher price it tastes good for a Americanized Chinese restaurant they have good drinks most of there food isn't greasy at they have slot of low calorie opinion I'll be back"}
{"text":"Fine, solid P.F. Chang's location. The decor is pretty cool, love the large overhead lanterns. Service has been generally quick, friendly and efficient. Happy Hour wines this time (or in general) were passable but not outstanding. The Grenache was fairly decent, but the Cabernet had a distinct impression of incense, lol. Interesting. Enjoyed the spicy tuna roll and the hand-folded crab wontons were, in my opinion, excellent. This is a solid choice for your asian fix, even for a chain. It's worth a stop."}
{"text":"Made in USA
This is obviously not an authentic Chinese restaurant. I realized that, way before I looked at the menu. No Chinese people around. The only Chinese I saw were statues decorating the place. And the menus are as easy to read as panda express menus.
  We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps,( fresh and crispy) the Chang's chicken ( sweet & sour) and the shrimp with lobster sauce. ( my favorite) Food was delicious. I really liked everything we tried, although it was a little too salty or to MSG-ish?
 Service was great! (Another sign this is not an authentic Chinese restaurant.) we had 3 servers! One got us drinks, one took our order, one delivered the food. Wow, I hope they share tips.
 The overall experience was good enough to come back and to recommend this place to friends. This may not be an authentic Chinese restaurant, but is definitely an authentic P.F. Chang!"}
{"text":"Worst service. Came in struggling with my daughter in the car seat sleep and son and they just watched me. Then when we got our food it was literally so disgusting I almost visited. Panda Express tasted better than what we got. Esthetic ally the food didn't look appetizing either. I've been too many locations of PF Change it generally always was the same (like chain food can be) but this was just a very poor experience. Our server never came back after the waiter brought the food out but was in the back talking to coworkers."}
{"text":"We stayed for happy hour and got a selection of small plates. Calamari, veggie lettuce wraps, California roll and crab wontons. Cocktails were good and well priced. The food was OK."}
{"text":"I've had good meals and service here in the past on annual trips to Vegas, but not this time. Drinks sat empty waiting for refills, the server walked away without mixing the sauce for lettuce wraps and didn't return til we'd given up and attempted to mix our own. The salad was inedible, the meal wasn't much better. Undercooked rice, no flavor. No sign of our server for at least 15 minutes while we waited for our check. It was lunchtime on a weekday, not very busy. We went here as part of a long standing family tradition, but won't waste another Vegas meal \"time slot\" on this place. Try Kung Fu at the other end of town."}
{"text":"i found out that portion size is good, then bad. i complained to corporate and they blocked my ip address. do not go there, they have no customer service!!!"}
{"text":"About a month ago we went to the Mesa PF Changs for dinner...... Long story short, the service was mediocre and disappointing at best.  We paid the bill and a manager walked over, knowing we were dissatisfied with the quality of service and food, handed me a card for a free appetizer to redeem on our next visit.  So they were not willing to compensate us for THIS miserable visit, but they were assuming we would want to come back. Hence the coupon.   I took it and we left. About two weeks later, my son asked my husband and I to pick up dinner for him on the way home from our date night. We went out to another restaurant for date night, but my son, requested that we pick up PF Changs for him.  My husband and I go in and sit down at the bar to order the meal to go. We both ordered cocktails while we looked over the menu. We ordered my son a $15.00 meal to go and had a bar tab going at this point. We were stuffed from dinner, but I remembered I had the free appetizer coupon in my purse. I pulled it out and asked the bartender if there was any way we could use it for a little dessert instead of an appetizer since we were not hungry for dinner. He called over the \"manager\"  Matt.   We explained to Matt that we would love to use our \"shitty service coupon \" on a dessert instead of an appetizer. With the most condiscending tone and attitude he says \"Oh sorry that can only be used for an appetizer.\" So, confused at Matt's stupidity and aloof attitude and nonexistent customer service skills ( HELLO IDIOT!!!!!!! Do you not even wonder how we got the stupid free food card in the first place!!!)  You think possessing that card would be a red flag that states \"TAKE CARE OF THIS CUSTOMER!!!!!\".  So, after mulling over Matt's ingnorance over not giving me a $4.95 dessert, that probably costs them $1.00 to make, I ordered the most expensive appetizer on the menu, $10 shrimp. We had it wrapped up to go.   My husband and I must have been obviously miffed, and I still am not sure how the slick and perceptive bartender relayed the message to Matt,  but as we were paying our bill for the drinks and my sons food, Matt walks up to us and says, \"Can I get you two a desert, and Recommends the banana egg rolls, which are, I must admit fabulous!!!!  We both looked at him like the wacko that he is and said \"No thanks, we are just leaving.\"  So, to recap, We had a miserable visit, they tried to compensate with a coupon for our next visit, but on our next visit we left more aggravated than on the initial miserable visit.  Hence this lengthy review..... Customer service is common sense based. You either possess it or you don't .   I have no desire to ever return to this location. Too many fabulous places to eat and spend my money with people who appreciate my business and who realize that Customers like me are the ones who keep them working!!!!!   Ugggg! Even more frustrated that I just spend 30 minutes of my life writing this review .  I hope it saves some other poor soul the trouble of eating at this location."}
{"text":"New lunch bowls are amazing. I had the tempura shrimp and veggie bowl. So good! My girlfriend had a noodle bowl that she loved. Portions are huge! Great service as always."}
{"text":"I really enjoy PF Chang's, and this was just another great experience. It gave me solace in the vast disgusting Vegas wasteland of sadness and grime."}
{"text":"Orgasm in your mouth. Lord those egg rolls. Honestly if only i could marry food. I love your food. I love your workers. And i love this one drink but idk what it was called but you guys seriously i love you good job to be honest"}
{"text":"Celibrated with family and had a nice dinner, the chicken fried rice is great."}
{"text":"Had great service here and was surprised at how authentic their food was. I was with my girlfriend and we wanted our food not to be rushed. I informed our sever and everything went well from the appetizers to the free dessert (birthday). It was a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour after shopping at SouthPark.  I ordered the spare ribs and she ordered the lettuce wraps.  Ribs were amazing!!!!!  I usually hate lettuce wraps, but I had some of hers and they were excellent.  Great food"}
{"text":"First time at a PF.  Typical chain.  Atmosphere was great and service was fine, but food was like fast food.  The dish was big enough to share so I can't complain for $15 meal for two.  Good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Great Place! I've always liked coming here and their food is good to go as well as their service. Fantastic."}
{"text":"We came here tonight for my birthday dinner.  It was just wonderful.  The restaurant was packed but we got a table right away.  The food was fresh and the portions were large.  We had enough leftover for several meals.  I really like this restaurant for a nicer night out.  It is a bit pricey for everyday though."}
{"text":"Still good food but I find that more times than not when we go we have to ask for clean dishes or silverware. I have found this whether we are at the Waterfront location or the Robinson location. Maybe they need a new contract with a new appliance company."}
{"text":"Food quality definitely delivered - lettuce wraps, egg drop soup, coconut curry vegetables, and the fried rice.   All above par, bravo.

Service was spotty.  Very good at first.  Server (at first) forgot one of the items ordered.  

After delivery of lettuce wraps and egg drop soup, server disappeared - long enough to where we eventually had to ask a server from another area to bring us some pepper for the egg drop soup.  

Later was another stretch where server didn't check-in for an extended period of time.  From that point on they were present enough, but the two stretches of nowhere-to-be-seen kept this from a higher rating.

Food was delicious, need the service to be top-notch as well."}
{"text":"Ryan sat us Jan 1st 2016, less than 24 hours after my wedding at the stroke of midnight the night before. He was prompt, attentive and the food was delicious. He went above and beyond with dessert. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Pretty lack luster this time, the pad thai was very underwhelming.  Overly wet and bland.  I've had better here, could have just been an off night."}
{"text":"First time visiting any PF Chang even though I live near one in California. We were in Vegas recently, kind of bummed being here at home now and missing Vegas. It's my favorite place in the whole world, not because I'm a gambler but because I love the lights, the nice hotels and the great restaurants!
We wanted to try something different and I browsed Yelp for nearby restaurants with Asian flair. PF Chang kept coming up so we went here.
The bar stood out when I first arrived, it was actually very pretty and well stocked and the restaurant itself was immaculate and clean. We were seated immediately and our server arrived promptly and took our drink orders.
Our server was one of the nicest, coolest servers ever. I don't recall his name but he mentioned being from a small town in Illinois, very nice and tended to us quite well. When the service is good, you know the food will match the service as well.
Indeed the food was spectacular!
We started with lobster avocado rolls, we were so hungry and they were gone within minutes, haha.
Our orange shrimp and pepper steak were equally delicious and out of this world, so flavorful and yummy! I do recommend the pepper steak.
Definitely recommend this place and will be back for sure next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love PF Changs.   I always get the vegetarian lettuce wraps, steamed edamame and the Ma Po Tofu for dinner.   The wife and I usually inhale the lettuce wraps and then snack on the edamame while we wait for our main courses.   They have good tea and we'll usually get a pot of that along with water to drink.

The place is in a bad spot as that whole area of Chagrin Blvd is a nightmare to traverse and idiots abound behind the wheel.   Just something to consider.

This place is pretty clean although they keep the mens room heated to the level of a sauna, so don't go in their over dressed because you may suffer heat stroke and pass out.   The restaurant itself is comfortable and tastefully decorated.

Service has always been great.   I always ask for extra spice in my dishes and the servers always get that square with the kitchen.   They keep my water topped off and bring the check promptly when the meal is over, can't ask for much more than that.

Overall, I recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"Never an issue with service. The sweet and sour chicken always seems to be missing correct amount of chicken. But great quality Food."}
{"text":"Waiter name Jill gave me the wrong chicken,never came back to ask for water refill"}
{"text":"we had a Wonderful Experience tonight because of our Server Sherri. She was Amazing and really cared! We have someone with a nut Allergy so it was so wonderful to have this beautiful Caring professional server, that actually cared and was just wonderful! Thanks Sherri for Making our Grandson's Birthday dinner the Best!"}
{"text":"Asian pear mojito and extra spicy pad Thai are my faves. The staff is extra friendly and the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Yes, this is a chain restaurant, but the quality of the food is excellent and consistent. I really like their Happy Hour menu. Great little bites of food that taste great and are perfect for that time of evening. Some of their handmade cocktails are really tasty. Nice decor and great vibe. The wait for a table can be long at times. The service can be hit or miss. But I have yet to eat something there that didin't taste and look great."}
{"text":"Ick, just thinking about it gives me a headache. Food is extremely salty, greasy, poor excuse for chinese food. Poor excuse for food in general. If I had to eat something (why is this place so popular for group gatherings?!), I guess it would be the chicken lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"I love the fresh options available at P.F. Chang's. This location in particular had excellent service. Our waiter had stellar drink recommendations and kept our water full at all times. He always checked on us to see if we needed anything. The summer menu is off the chain! The ambiance and location are superb as well. Five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at the PF Changs by Southpark my whole life and it's always been one of my favorite restaurants.
this location is closer to where I live now so we frequent it occasionally, it has never been as good as southpark but last night might be the last time we have dinner here.

It was a Sunday at around 6 and we were immediately seated. Our waitress was very friendly and took our drink and appetizer orders, we got the lettuce wraps.
They were delivered with no spoon for the sauce, and with no plates. We had to wait for about 5 minutes with our food getting cold before we got our plates. The wraps themselves were good, luckily they havent changed these. 

I've been ordering the kung pao shrimp for a good 10 years now, and last night it was delivered and it was unrecognizable. PF Changs has undergone a complete revamp of the menu and drinks. (They've gotten rid of all their old signature cocktails which were far better) and they have changed  A TON of the dishes. The kung pao shrimp is one of these, the shrimp were so heavily battered and dry. It was nothing like what I've been accustomed to. I know this isnt a location decision, but a corporate one, but the food was no where near as good as it used to be before all the changes.

We ordered 2 desserts, the chocolate dome and the cheesecake, both were very good.
Overall, it wasnt the worst meal ever, but if you are used to the old PF changs, you will probably be disappointed."}
{"text":"Estuve por dos horas en total para que llegara mi postre , súper lento el servicio , y no vale la pena la comida , no volvería ni aunque me paguen"}
{"text":"So when I found myself in Happy Valley - Phoenix, AZ for business and searching for somewhere to have dinner, PF Chang's caught my eye, which was in a shopping complex in the area.  This restaurant looks a little newer than most PF Chang's and also includes nice patio dining in addition to an attractive bar area which I opted for.  Happy hour runs from 3:00pm-7:00pm and I ordered the popular chicken lettuce wraps for $6.00.  Pretty flavorful and a great value for the price. I also added spring rolls which were not outstanding but okay enough.  But the best was being pleasantly surprised on how well they made their dirty martinis.  I don't think of PF Chang's as a place for stellar cocktails but everyone in the bar area seemed really happy and satisfied with all their drink orders.  PF Chang's continues to evolve their menu items towards the needs of their customers.  That alone and a good effort and delivery on food makes this place a pretty good and consistent choice for lunch, happy hour or dinner."}
{"text":"A little pricey for the portion size. I love the gluten free Mongolian Beef though. There gluten free options are all very good"}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's is an upscale national chain with a giant horse statue in front. I think the horse is pretty uniform of all P.F. Chang's locations. The interior is classy and contemporary, with large booths and a bustling bar. The lead singer of the local cover band \"spazmatics\" used to work there and I would giggle thinking about how silly he looks in their nerd stage outfits. Anyways, if you go, try the lettuce wraps and flourless chocolate cake. I have never had a bad meal there and never heard of anyone having a bad meal. Why the 4/5 stars? It isn't locally owned. Sorry P.F. Changs! Local always trumps national! 

Their menu has some constants but they do make updates often, focusing on a different regional cuisine of China. They were a true pioneer with their gluten free menu, which as all celiac's know is a godsend since most Chinese is off limits with all the wheat in soy sauce. (That last statement was meant to be educational for all the WLs (wheat lovers). Shocking, yes, but soy sauce's 1st ingredient after water is wheat (unless you get super yummy gluten free sauce that is actually a ton tastier)."}
{"text":"Bought a ton of food for my hubby because it was his first time trying PF Chang's. He is the pickiest eater I've ever met and he's obsessed with East Coast Chinese food. Soooo... I'm sure you could imagine that when I told him PF Chang's was better than other Chinese food in the Paradise, NV area, he was hesitant. Regardless, order the lettuce wraps, beef broccoli and orange chicken. They are all amazing. I can't wait to try more of their dishes. Oh and don't forget ordering yourself a drink or two. Cheers! ??"}
{"text":"I always love the atmosphere at PF Changs.  The food was delicious.  Calamari was extremely fresh and melted in your mouth.  Wonton Soup is always a good fall back especially when there is a chill in the air.  Service was great.  They were very attentive and kept our drinks full.  The entrees were good.  The standard PF Changs food."}
{"text":"Had to share, cuz this was the best experience I've ever had at this chains restaurants..... The food was INCREDIBLE, the drinks, CRAZY GOOD - mai tai fishbowl was soooo huge & yummy - and the wait staff was on top of everything the whole time!!! After a show had just gotten out and it was a Friday. My three friends had never been, and they are now huge PF Chang's fans!!!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.

My lunch at Changs was so good that I am still losing my mind. Everything I ate was perfect. Things I ate included:

- Streamed Shrimp Dumplings

- Shanghai Cucumbers

- Shrimp Melon Salad

- Schezwan Shrimp

- Lemongrass Shrimp with Noodles

- Shrimp with Lobster Sauce

- Mango Iced Tea

Yes that is a lot of shrimp, and yes every single bite was damn good. Also, yes I am a giant fat ass who orders 7 things for lunch. So? It was THAT good.

All you freaks who hate chain restaurants and refuse to like PF Changs just because it's all corporate are really missing out. Missing out on great service, instant refills, perfectly cooked deliciously spiced food and a solid place to eat."}
{"text":"We love Changs & have for years. This location is def our fave. The food is good, fast & consistant especially at lunch time. We are happy to report they have lunch combos now which aren't the usual comfy combos we are all used to in those styro containers. These are fresh & delish. Go for lunch you wont' be sorry."}
{"text":"I don't often recommend MSG, but this place needs MSG... or SOMETHING. Nothing seems to have any flavor!

I've tried the Szechuan Chicken, Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, and the Orange Peel Chicken. I would not order any of them again.

The only exception is the dumplings. Those were tasty and cooked perfectly (ordered steamed).

I would not go out of my way for P.F. Chang's."}
{"text":"PF Changs is one of those places that is always going to be solid and I am always going to like it...I remember when it opened where Grand Lux CAfe is now...I love going here for Dim Sum Happy Hour...its a great deal and its fun to go with friends after work.  My boyfriend and I like to go on dates here very now and then too.  We both like the pork dumplings that are steamed and pan fried...they are both delicious and of course we always have the waitor mix up some of that great sauce with the hot mustard and chili paste!  I really like the orange chicken, the moo shu chicken, mongolian beef, changs spicy chicken, kung pao chicken and the dan dan noodles.  I also really love their chocolate cake...Ask for it warmed up with raspberry sauce and chocolate sauce with vanilla ice cream! You may only want this for your meal hahaha...This place will always be here and I will always enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness this meal was paid for with the expense account because it was basically a sit down Panda Express with fancy cocktails. 

You know that taste you get in your mouth when you've eaten too much sweets... yeah, expect to get that after dinner here."}
{"text":"Long overdue review for PF Changs!  We came here for my Aunt's birthday (per her request) and I hope she does not request to go here again.  I used to not mind PF Changs, and actually liked them, but their quality of food has gone way down hill.

I ordered the sesame chicken and my husband got the beef with broccoli.  My aunt got some sort of chicken (which seemed overcooked from my taste).  Our dishes were awful, if you love salt you will love them!  I know Chinese is usually very high in sodium, but when you get salt as the main taste rather than bringing out the taste of the beef/veggies, it is an issue.

I really can't say anything good about this place.  So many other good local chinese places that are a better option."}
{"text":"I guess I should know better then to pick this place for a quick lunch. I will blame myself for getting the latest round of mediocre service and sub standard Chinese food on my inability to wait in the line that was in front of Culinary Dropout which basically forced us to choose to eat here.

My husband and I couldn't even remember the last time we ate at PF Chang's. We thought it had been at least 10 years and it was in Albuquerque, New Mexico for heaven sakes. That's how unimpressed we are with their food.

Well so when it comes to spending $50 for two people at lunch, this is the place to come and waste it.

First of all note, that if you choose to eat inside the restaurant that it's freezing cold and to bring a jacket. If you decide to eat on the patio like we did, note that you will bombarded by the flies that will come around as soon as your food is served.

Due to the restaurant being very cold, we decided to eat outside. We should of known better. Everyone knows that if you choose to eat outside when there's only one other diner that the service you get will be less then stellar.

Our waitress didn't come around for 10 minutes and she seemed very rushed and def not attentive. No small talk for this one.

We decide to order from the Wok lunch specials of kung pao chicken and Mongolian beef, with two iced teas. Within 15 minutes our food came up and as you can see from the pictures, it's a lunch portion with more rice then chicken and more rice then beef. My kung pao chicken had celery and peanuts mixed in. Not a water chestnut in sight.

The taste of my chicken was served hot, had decent flavor and a bit salty. My hubby's Mongolian beef was a little tough and his scallions a plenty. Way too plenty. It was the only thing the beef was served with. The lunch specials were okay, nothing special.

Still hungry and even with the \"fiies\" buzzing around and a waitress that was never around, we decided to order two desserts to continue to feed our hunger or hope for a better experience.

While we were waiting for our monster chocolate cake and the banana spring rolls, the table next to us hadn't been bussed in the 30 minutes we were eating there and consequently, more flies started buzzing around.

Since our waitress was busy doing other things, gosh knows what, we put our finished plates on the other table to prevent attracting more flies towards us. This was a good idea. 

Our cake and banana spring rolls were finally served and ta da...thank heavens it turned out to fill our sweet tooth needs and make us feel not so hungry. The cake was so large that we took it 3/4 of it to go. If you order this, make sure that you know that it's a group cake good enough for 2-3 people to share.

Overall, the service was mediocre ( I had to stand up and leave the patio to ask us the waitress to fill my ice tea ), the food so so and the flies did not help.

As far as coming back to the location, we'll wait another 10 years to try again as there are far better places to spend $50 for lunch in Paradise Valley/Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Never been treated so poorly by management. I ordered through Grubhub and waited approximately an hour for my meal. I had specific instructions for no onions and when I opened my package, It had a sticker on my meal that stated no onions three times, however the meal had huge chunks of white onion throughout. I called the restaurant, waited about 10 minutes for the manager to come to the phone where he continued to belittle me on my allergy and told me that I couldn't eat the dish regardless because it had onion powder in it. Onion powder is not the same as the raw onion. He then said that he would have Grubhub refund me. I received a phone call five minutes later from the manager stating that the to go person stated that there were absolutely no onions in my meal. I have posted a photo on the website showing my meal with the Receipt attached stating no onions. Absolutely horrible service."}
{"text":"My family and I had a stop over in Vegas, and decided to try this place because of the great reviews and the style of cuisine that we were craving at the time.  We were seated right away, despite the appearance of a packed restaurant.  Our server, Uylsses was awesome!  He was very quick, attentive, and very friendly.  

I ordered a Moscow Mule, which didn't come in the traditional copper mug, but the fresh taste of the drink made up for the presentation flaw.  The appetizer that deserves honorable mention was the pork steamed dumplings and the chicken Satay.  Amazing!  The Singapore street noodles and chicken lo mien was also very good and the lo mien was the clear winner.  The fact that this is a chain restaurant, really surprised me.  The the quality of food and phenomenal service will have us coming back for more.  Overall a near perfect execution!"}
{"text":"Salt n pepper calamari was delicious along with their lobster sauce shrimp worth every dollar spent and the service was great"}
{"text":"Went on a dinner date here. We order the Lo Mein and Fried Egg Rolls. The food was delicious and tasty. We got great service and didn't have to wait long to be sitted. I highly recommend eating at this location."}
{"text":"i hadn't been to a P F Chang's before but have seen them all over Seattle and was excited when the bf suggested we try it. We went at 8pm on a Wednesday and was told that there was a 45 minute wait and so we happily took our buzzer and went and sat in the Planet Hollywood's Extra bar. Their drinks were fabulous and 30 minutes later, the buzzer was going off. We were seated on the top floor in the back and so it was nice and quiet, despite the 2 long tables of people in front of our booth.

They have a 2-For-$40 deal that provides you with your choice of soup, one appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 mini desserts. Waaaayyyy too much food for 2 people but it allowed us to try all kinds of dishes. 

I started with a wine flight, that gives you 3 - 2.5 oz glasses of wine for $10. $10!!! Definitely took advantage of that as they have an extensive wine list. The bf had a beer as they were $3 and cheaper than anything you can buy on the strip. Bonus!

For our soup course, we both had the Sweet and Sour and it was full of chicken, mushrooms, tofu, and egg ribbons. It was kinda spicy but a nice way to start the meal. Portions are huge and so I felt bad about only eating half but otherwise wouldn't have been able to get past the appetizer flight.

For the appetizer, we had the Chicken Wraps. I had heard nothing but about how good these wraps are since we found the restaurant the night before. They lived up to their reputation though as everything from the lettuce to the little sauce that was customized for us, was wonderful. Again, the dish wasn't finished as you would have to stuff the lettuce leaves to capacity to get through all of the filling they provide you with.

For entrees, we had the Mongolian Beef and Cantonese Shrimp. The beef was accompanied by long pieces of green onion and wasn't too gingery. The meat was nicely seared so the marinade formed a crunchy outside. Delish! The shrimp were in a light garlic sauce and the snow peas were perfectly cooked. We had brown rice on the side and there was definitely enough food for 4 people. Yikes but yummmm!

For dessert, our fabulous waiter brought out a litle sample tray and explained each shot-glass sized dessert to us. We chose the Strawberry Cheesecake and S'more and while I was too full to try them, they were gone in about 30 seconds. The perfect end to a meal!

If you get this deal, either expect to have multiple leftovers or make sure you have a large party to help share the feast!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, good place to go when you're looking for cross-region Asian flavors. Their sea bass is nicely done, the dishes aren't greasy, serving size is substantial and price is reasonable"}
{"text":"I had some trepidation after reading the reviews but decided to make my own decision. Glad I did. Pros: apps were hot from the kitchen when we got them: one calamari and one cauliflower. Entrees were two large salads, one lettuce wrap, one large \"hot & sour soup\" and one Mongolian beef. All were very good and plenty large enough for any appetite. Service from Nicole was excellent. 
Cons, the restaurant was very busy and our waitress was also bussing our table which meant that inevitability there would be empty plates crowding the plates from which we were eating until she could get back to bus the empties from the table. Not an ideal situation. We thought the quality and quantity of the food represented \"value\" for the cost of our meal."}
{"text":"I would rate this higher because my dish was definitely a 4+. Problem was it took me a long time to even get it ordered. They have gluten-free menus & vegetarian/vegan menus but the two do not combine unless you just want rice & a side of steamed veggies which was not what I had hoped for. Eventually the server had a manager out who then got the chef out & he cane up with a great tasting tofu dish. Meanwhile the rest of the large party had already finished their food & I had to try a few bites of my dish & get it packed to go since I had an appointment to get to. Fried tofu always tastes best fresh. But it was very good. I appreciate that the chef did come out to discuss the options & then make something special, Wish it hadn't taken the server so long to get others involved. This could really be resolved by having just one entree on the menu, but most of the sauces are pre-made which is why I couldn't get the tofu lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"I tried PF Changs for the first time EVER a few weeks ago. Seeing that I love restaurants and Asian food, I don't know why it took me so long.  We had awesome service when we went, our server was training their new manager which I thought was cool. He went into further detail saying that new management has to shadow every job in the restaurant so they get a feel of all parts of the restaurant so they could provide the best service possible. Two thumbs up for that. We enjoyed cocktails such as the PFX (which of course I kept calling the P90X) X-RATED Fusion Liqueur, Mango Vodka and Pama Liqueur shaken with a splash of Sprite and the Lucky Cat Martini (Vanilla Vodka, Chambord, Pineapple Juice)which I will go back there again just for that.

We started off with the famous lettuce wraps. I say famous because anytime I hear someone talking about PF Changs, they always rave about how wonderful they are. They didn't disappoint. When our entrees came out, I didn't realize that it was a family style kind of thing going on but I like that. I always have food envy so I was happy that I got to try other things besides the Orange Peel Chicken that I  ordered. Everything was fabulous......except my fortune in my fortune cookie."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The restaurant is very accommodating especially since I have a peanut/tree nut allergy. The drinks at the bar were good and the bartender was very friendly which made us come back the next night. If you're on the Vegas strip and want quick food and good service. I recommend you eating there."}
{"text":"Ok so it's a chain, but a reliable one. I came in around 2:00 pm on a Monday afternoon and the place was surprisingly crowded for a very late lunch hour. I grabbed one of several open seats at the bar and looked over the menu. 

One thing I like about this chain is they frequently change up the menu just enough to make it interesting. The old favorites are still there, but a few fresh, new items show us as well. 

Today, I decided to try one of these called Chang's Spicy Chicken. It was excellent. The server, a very nice girl named Brittany, asked me how I'd like my \"special sauce.\" Mild, medium, or hot? I went with hot, and had the privilege of watching her make it right in front of me. 

And it was hot, but not too hot. Not the kinda hot where you need to grab the water glass. But I guess fire tolerances are relative. So maybe take a little sample first. 

Had a hot & sour soup ahead of time, which came with the meal. It was also very good. 

Like all PF Chang's, this is a nice & hip environment. The main drawback, which is not the restaurant's fault, is all the drunks that come into the place. Several servers told me it was a recurring problem, and I witnessed one while I was there. 

This guy came in, sat at the bar, got up, stumbled through one side of the dining room and the other. Then went into the restrooms, then came out, then sat at the bar again. Babbled in a language that can only be described as Drunkese, then was finally asked to leave. 

Lunch and a show. 

But overall, a fantastic experience and very friendly and professional staff. I'd come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill and I don't expect that we will be going back. In fact, I don't expect it to be in business past Christmas. They raised their prices, changed the menu, and removed several of our favorite dishes from the menu. The veggie dumplings are gone, the jasmine iced tea is gone, and the mini-dessert are gone. The food is meh. My broccoli was mushy in the ginger chicken and the sauce was like candy because it was too sweet."}
{"text":"Yummm very busy even on a Sunday night.  Bar is first come first served."}
{"text":"Very big fan normally of this restaurant previously back home in ohio where I am from but tonight was not the best. We had come to
Celebrate my daughters birthday after having to leave a hibachi restaurant bc the wait was too long. We were seated in about 7 mins which was great but the service was disappointing we had to ask several times for refills and the waiters didn't get our orders correctly for a party of 5 (3 adults and 2 children) they forgot my sons side, my daughters drink and my side of sauce. I work in customer service and I have a degree in culinary arts so service is very important to us. The portion of my meal was great and yummy I had the kung pao shrimp, my mom was recommended the ginger chicken it was very bland and not work the money, my husband got the shrimp and lobster, not a fan lots of rice
And small small portions of meat. Kids meal is 4.00 meal which i guess u get what you pay for and my daughter had the bowl of hot and sour soup which was way too much for a 12 year old wish out waiter took the time to say it was too much of a portion. Those are the detailed things that make customer service and a good waiter stand out to me. Over all it was a meal just wish it was a better experience and everyone could of walked away. Happy but half of the table was not satisfied with their food for an almost 100.00 receipt kinda disappointing"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas we stopped here to grab a nice dinner.
Our service was off the charts. Our server Josh had a big happy smile, very professional and prompt. He accommodated all our request without a hitch. The young man Sam who delivered our food also was very helpful and happy to serve us. Lindsay, the bartender who made our drinks, did such an outstanding job on our cocktail request, I had to thank her personally. The staff really went out of their way to give us an experience above and beyond. Thank you to the management, your staff is happy to be there! Great job everyone!"}
{"text":"I usually try to avoid franchises, both to frequent and to review - bit this one is an exception, due to the spectacular visit we had. 

The service was nice even if there was bit of a mix up when we were seated, but the service never was unprofessional one bit. Halfway through the meal the manager came out and spoke to us, and gave us all $10 gift cards for this establishment. For a party of 4 that was quite nice for me that took care of the bill. (I promise I tipped decently on the actual amount.)

The food doesn't impress me, but the restaurant is very nice looking. That together with a surprising service, that gave us a really nice dinner experience. And that is what I wanted to convey by my review."}
{"text":"Sadly, I will probably never be able to eat at this place again.  Eight hours after I ate my take-out from P.F. Chang's, I either 1) suddenly came down with the stomach flu or 2) got food poisoning.  Siu Wok is better, anyway.

:("}
{"text":"Best Chinese Food and Great atmosphere.. Me and the wifey drive half hour to eat here and always satisfied and also great service too.!!"}
{"text":"I went to the place.. ordered some starter and entrees.. the server was very careless..he served the plates which are not clean, I asked him to change the plates.. he took those wipe them and got the same plates which are oily.. I found some insects in the chicken entree.. I asked the manager he didn't respond well about it.. I have been to P.F. Chang's manytimes.. this is the first time I visited in charlotte.. I won't recommend this place. Bad and very poor service"}
{"text":"Monday night at 8:30pm, not busy at all. We ordered an appetizer and dinner to share. After ordering, we waited for what seemed to be an unusual long amount of time, our server completely disappeared after taking our order and our dinner was served to by another person. Still our server was MIA. Still no appetizer ... After we divided up our portions and nearly finishing our meal our server was still no where. Our food was warm, not hot. Finally as we were about finished eating & she appears and asks us if we would like desert. We mentioned about our appetizer, she apologized and gave us a comp on our meal. Overall the service was less than desired, appetizer never served, and we left unsatisfied. 
Extremely disappointing as we really like PF Chang's but I doubt we will return to this location."}
{"text":"Having good time with my son Kenneth here.  Not my first time, I call this's a higher class Chinese take out.  But I enjoy the food here.
Start with the two typical hot & sour & egg drop soup. Then chicken lettuce wrap.
I like the steamed salmon & my son ordered Beef à La Sichuan. 
I prefer to Egg Drop soup than the other one,
The fish came out OK without the lots of ginger and green onion.  The Beef dish was way over cooked & dry like rubber.  The waiter took it back and changed for us to Pepper Steak.

We just found that the picture shown by the restaurant on the Beef á La Sichuan is not the same.  Unless you like jerky beef, I don't recommend Beef á La Sichuan."}
{"text":"I am a semi frequent visitor of the P. F. Chang's franchise. However, I wasn't as pleased this time around. I came here last night with my friend, and the only two things (I took half a star off of each for). The first half was taken off because our waiter, even though he was nice and very accommodating, he thought it was appropriate to wipe his finger on his nose and sniffle as soon as we were greeted to our table. Assuming he sanitizes in the kitchen after, it's no big deal but killed the mood a little. The other half was taken off because when we walked in the hostess just stared at us like a deer in headlights for at least a minute. So I asked if we could just have a table for two in which she only replied \"yea\". Not even a hi or how are you. She didn't even let us know to follow whoever it was to our table. And another thing that sort of irked me was the waiter circling the portion on the check that says \"tip\"... And put a smile on it. I'm a great tipper but when you circle and expect it, it makes me not want to give you anything (but we still obviously gave a tip). We ordered the butternut squash potstickers and let me tell you.... These should be called pasta ravollis. They were disgusting! But after telling the waiter, it was taken off the tab which was nice. Otherwise, the atmosphere is very casual and very \"romantic\" I would say. Maybe a little overpriced for the quality of food. But the soup is great!"}
{"text":"So when I moved to Charlotte I would always ask people where the best Chinese restaurant was.  And if you can believe it, I was told PF Chang's by countless people, most of whom did not know it was a chain.  It's like moving somewhere and asking for the best hamburger in town and everyone tells you it's Mickey D's!  Exactly.

So I did actually go since I had never been and the food was barely Asian as it was.  The only thing I liked were the lettuce wraps, I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was ok, but certainly nothing to write home about..  

To conclude, this is a place for those who may want to dip their toe into Asian cuisine, but if you go here expecting great or even authentic Chinese food you will be sorely disappointed"}
{"text":"Took some people out Pre-valentine's day.  Ordered chicken wraps which were good.  We had a dirty martini which was very well prepared with enough olives.  
I ordered my favorite salt and pepper shrimp.  The other dishes were beef with broccoli, pork fried rice and spicy beef.  The broccoli tasted as it was taken out of the frozen broccoli bag and dumped on the plate.  No flavor.  The pork fried rice lacked seasoning and had chunks of pork that were dry and hard to eat.  Why not make the chunks smaller so that it integrates into the rice as the large chunks were almost inedible (they were so dry and hard).  And for $12.95, I expect fried rice to be spectacular---hey folks, it's just rice--I expect you to do a bang up job at this price point.  Most restaurants charge $8 at most.  
The spicy beef was tasty but it was overwhelmed with just celery and carrots which my dining companion would not eat. After a few pieces of celery you have had enough and since there was no variety of veggies, he left them. 
 My salt and pepper shrimp was good but I did notice that the size of the shrimp was not consistent throughout the dish.  At my Scottsdale location, the shrimp are all large--here, some small and some large.   
To be polite my companions packed their food and took it home, I hope they didn't dump it as I paid a lot of money for this meal.  
I belong to PF Chang's loyalty club because I love their food most of the time.  Today, not so much."}
{"text":"Cocktails are excellent. Don't understand the Dynamite Shrimp - 1970s shrimp cocktail sauce over deep fried shrimp in a lettuce cup - no hint of dynamite nor of seafood flavour. That said, excellent were: Sichuan Wontons, Crab Salad. Good were Dan Dan  Noodles.  Decor is Chinese kitsch meets cocktail bar. Service was very good."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst chinese food I ever ate.I don't recommend it at all.The interior of the restaurant is cute.The food looks like it would be good but I base my opinion on taste.The Praws and long life noodles burned my lips they were so salty.The ginger chicken was flavorless.The lomein noodle was over cooked spaghetti with a little teryaki sauce on it. Pathetic"}
{"text":"We always come to this location because the service is so great, but tonight that was NOT the case. 

Sat at the bar and was ignored for over ten minutes, the male bartender named \"Ryan\" informed me he was too busy. He asked if I wanted to order and walked away as I was telling him what I wanted to eat. The entire bar was complaining about how horrible Ryan was, none of us received silverware, I didn't get a refill on my water, and the other bartenders were complaining with the serving staff about how terrible Ryan was and how he was \"purposely ignoring customers\". 

The manager, Dillon, I spoke to seemed nonchalant about my concern, so I promptly left. 

If you want good service, and portions that aren't microscopic, do NOT eat at this location."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I haven't had good luck finding a Chinese restaurant in Henderson that I like, so I stick with this place! It's consistent! 

My favorite dish is the Kung Pao Chicken. I also love the Mongolian Beef...so I like ordering both and sharing with who I'm with. The pork dumplings are pretty good but I'd recommend asking for a side of dipping sauce because they only drizzle a little on top. 

The banana spring roll dessert is my favorite restaurant dessert ever!! It's so good! It's friend bananas (picture an egg roll) with caramel sauce and yummy ice cream. It's amazing! 

The service is always great and there's hardly ever a wait. Tonight we went earlier than usual (5:30pm) and we had about a 10 minute wait. Not bad for a Saturday night, around the holidays."}
{"text":"Yes, of all places to eat in Vegas, I choose PF Changs. Wanted something assuredly gluten free. Sat at the bar so no wait. Server was impartial to me but at least knowledgeable of my gf requirements. Ordered lettuce wraps which were to my liking. $4 drinks for happy hour, yes please. 4 stars for being a reliable gluten free restaurant no matter what city I'm in."}
{"text":"We got there and were seated promptly with our reservation.  The waiter was dealing with an unhappy table right next to ours. Their food had come out late and one of the plates was cold. The manager came over and comped some of their meal for them.  The waiter didn't introduce himself as he kept looking over at the disgruntled table.  He asked for our order and left.  The soup and lettuce wraps came out quickly, but we literally waited over an hour from the time we got there until our entrees arrived.  Once they did, some of the chicken seemed raw.  I'm pregnant, so I didn't risk eating it.  It was really stringy, slimy and chewy so I spat it out. The waiter barely spoke with us, was very awkward and inattentive. I wanted to cut him some slack and think maybe he had a rough night, but he barely even squeaked out an apology about our food being late and we were there for over 2 hours from the time we sat down at the table until the time we left. I recognize that people make mistakes, but at least own up to them and try to make it better.

My husband and I don't go out a lot, so when we do we like to make it a good experience.  Unfortunately tonight was NOT a good experience.  I think we will think twice before going back there again. :-S"}
{"text":"Went to P.F. Chang's for an early dinner Saturday. It wasn't very busy and parking was close and convenient, it was a little on the pricey side but worth it! Had the surf and turf with excellent crispy shrimp in it, Mongolian beef, Saki and twisted whiskey sours,also another beef dish that I can't remember the name of and sushi. Definitely will be coming back for the Mongolian beef it's the one to choose if you're undecided!"}
{"text":"I have ate at the St Louis resturant a few times and was never dissatisfied. This is my first visit to the las vegas location and I was a little disappointed in the service and the food. So to start off we are waiting to be seated the hostess trys to stop one of the waitress to seat us and she mumbles something back in the lines of she is busy so the hostess starts to seat us and another waiter jumped in and seated us. It took about 10 mins before waitress came and took our drink and food order. We get our soup and i ask for the won ton strips takes almost 10 mins for that and us to get straws that we didnt get when we got our drinks. The servers says sorry about the wait on the strips were busy....now my husbamd and i look around and wonder how are they busy? Yjere was not a lot of people in the resturant at the time, maybe 7-10 at the most. After the soup and lettuce wrap which is hands down my favorite thing the resturant serves this dish is amazing the balance between the chicken and water chesnuts is perfect.  My husband got the shrimp fried rice which he enjoyed but he said it could of had a feew more shrimp in it bit overall grest dish. I ordered the pepper steak it was a little on the salty side and not hot like it just came off the stove asaid from that it was good. The desert was a fav of mine i order it from where ever serves it tiramisu, the portion wad small for it to be a shareable dessert we did the changs for 2 for 44.95 so its a good thing my husband does not eat dessert.  It took forever after i ordered it for it to come, my biggest complaint was the slow service, she told us 2 different times our food was on its way out and it never came til 15 mins after the first time she told us. Not my worst experience at a restaurant but not the best either"}
{"text":"I rarely complain or send things back but the food here was just awful. I ordered curry noodles that just tasted sour. My wife had crispy honey shrimp that were the soggiest over-sauced glop you can imagine. The quality and portion size has gone way down over the years. Do yourself a favor and head to a mom and pop joint in Chinatown for some real Chinese food."}
{"text":"Stopped by this evening as we had business to do in the area.  Service was atrocious. We ordered drinks upon meeting our server.  Our Appetizers arrived...still no drinks.  We flagged down the manager who retrieved them.  Our meal arrived after quite some time.  Our drinks had been gone for quite some time.  Once again the manager retrieved.  We discussed our concerns with the manager.  He did offer desert for free which we declined.  The food was great once it got to the table.  Given the experience I can't say we will rush back to a P.F. Changs soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped today for a late lunch... About 2:00pm. Had the salmon lunch bowl, delicious! Great service, good food. We will go again!"}
{"text":"This establishment is just a couple miles off the strip and it was absolutely phenomenal! I went with my husband after attending a former co-workers' vow renewal at The Flamingo. Our server, whose name I can't remember, was very knowledgeable of the food on the menu (taste, level of spiciness, etc.) and helped us select one of the meat-free options as we are new to vegetarianism. I enjoyed the ambiance as the sun began to set, the lighting was dimmed and it felt more romantic. The food was great (especially the fresh ingredients) and the serving size was enough for a late-night snack/meal."}
{"text":"PF Changs stinks. Lousy food, lousy drinks, lousy service."}
{"text":"We always enjoy this venue in any city we find ourselves! Today our experience was lessened by the sour behavior of Maria, the hostess! We're of the opinion that one person's bad behavior does not deter us from enjoying ourselves! Our server, Holly, was lovely and not obtrusive in any way! Our three person party ordered all appetizers and left completely satisfied! Lettuce wraps,  bbq ribs,  spring rolls, hot and sour soup never ever disappoint! As an aside,  please put Maria in the dish washing station, greeting guests is simply NOT her forte!"}
{"text":"Chang's is a nice place for a quality lunch that won't kick my tail afterward at work. The service we get has always been good. The decor is well done, chic, and modern. Happy hour has good specials on appetizers."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard PF Chang's.  If you're looking for good, Americanized sweet Chinese food and don't mind eating at a chain, this is the right place.  You're never going to leave here thinking this is the best food ever, but you shouldn't leave disappointed either.

We came for a very late lunch and mowed down a ton of food on the happy hour menu, which is a relatively good deal.  The one major knock on this location is the service was very mixed - our food came pretty quickly, but the waiter never made us sauce for our lettuce wraps, forgot my drink, and pretty much went AWOL half-way through our meal."}
{"text":"What the eeF happened to this place!! Once upon a time it used to be good. Not so much anymore. Like Im never coming back anymore horrible. My food was soooo bad it was just hecka salty and soaked in soy. I made the waiter taste it and he damn near gagged. I gave this place another star just for the waiter being a trooper. be for warned tho. this PF changs is crap."}
{"text":"Ok...I was so exhausted from the 6:30 am flight that I didnt want to walk around searching for food.  I ate here twice in one day...at the Planet Hollywood location.  LMAO!  We ordered Lettuce Wraps and the spareribs (WITH SAUCE) and Crab Rangoon.  All of it was quality food.  I also ordered an asian pear martini.  I was spectacular!  Ahhh...the joys of adult beverages.  

On my second trip of the day, we were seated upstairs in the back.  Its a very intimate location.  I happen to like upstairs because it's not as noisy as the main dining area.  We ordered Wonton Soup, which comes in a bowl, big enough for 4, and Combination Fried rice.  That fried rice was the best I've ever had in all my years.  Damn, it was good!  

I love P.F. Changs...with a passion."}
{"text":"Had such a romantic dinner and enjoyed some of the most delicious meals. Experienced exceptional customer service by very attentive caring staff. We enjoyed as an appetizer the Kung Pao roll with the cauliflower tempura as an appetizer. The Kung pao roll was one of the best rolls I ever had and was very fresh tasting and beautifully presented. My husband loved the cauliflower tempura and couldn't stop eating it. It had a very sweet flavor. For our main courses we shared the surf n turf which was cooked to perfection along with the oolong Chilean sea bass that was served with a heaping generous portion of spinach. For dessert we shared the chocolate Dome and couldn't have been happier as it was a perfect portion for two and was a flourless version of a decadent chocolate cake but, wasn't too rich at all. I loved the hint of berries in the sauce that it sat in and pair perfectly with each bite. A perfect date night!! My husband knows Mary Beth and she is the sweetest! She gave us a perfect night that was definitely needed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice, but I ordered the Mahi Mahi and it came out over cooked and super dry. It was like eating cardboard."}
{"text":"Planning a family dinner so we decided to try it first.  Ordered the Japanese ramen with steak and shrimp along with the wonton soup. My husband ordered the Mongolian beef. My soup was luke warm. The ramen had way too much sauce it was swimming in it. The sauce was too sweet. The food itself was not hot just warm. Worst of all the beef and the shrimp tasted as if they were simply reheated. My husband's rice was hard. We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is decent. Portions are large for the price. Service is nice but soooooo slow. The last three times I've been here, it's taken 2.5 hrs for a simple meal (app and entree, no dessert or coffee). 

The FRIED GREEN BEANS appetizer is unhealthy but very tasty. There is a thick crunchy coating on the beans, and the dipping sauce is spicy. 

I asked if they could do CHANG'S SPICY CHICKEN WITH TOFU, and it was no problem. I chose the 5 spice baked tofu which was very firm and almost the texture of chicken. The sauce was sweet, similar to a sesame sauce, but overall the dish was great. 

Husband was very happy with PEPPER STEAK. The sauce was flavorful over a nice mix of veggies and thinly sliced beef. 

If it weren't for the incredibly slow service, I'd come here more often, if for no other reason than that is vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on Feb. 16. Our waitress Michele was superb! Mongolian Beef excellent. 
I had the spare ribs appetizer, orange ginger edemane, very different and delicious. Should have ordered the side of fried rice, but it only comes plain. Like pork fried rice, so had to order full size. Hardly any pork and flavorless. Lots to take home to jazz up. Two mango ice teas. Bill was $47.00. A little steep for lunch but very good food and excellent service"}
{"text":"PF Chang's is very consistent, wherever you may find one. This Vegas outlet is good. We had hot and sour soup (maybe a shade bland), spare ribs (a little too much sauce), honey walnut shrimp, broccoli beef and crispy orange peel chicken. Our waiter brought the wrong dishes at first and ended up boxing them up and giving 'em to us free of charge, so we had leftovers."}
{"text":"Wow I'm amazed this place is getting such bad reviews. I have only had one bad experience here, but that was because it was busy and I was STARVING. But luckily, this time that was not the case.

Came here for the happy hour menu at 5 PM. Got seated very quickly and perused the menu for a moment. Our waitress was very nice and was good at explaining what exactly was in the dishes so I could make sure what I was ordering was vegetarian (some vegetarian items on the menu do not have the symbol next to them, I think because of egg ingredients). I ended up ordering the vegetarian lettuce wraps for $5, veggie spring rolls for $3, and crispy green beans for $4, and also a red velvet cake sweet shot for $2. Everything came out very quickly and it was delicious. I had never had the green bean fries before and they were insanely good. Green beans fried lightly in a light, crunchy batter with a mayo-based sauce that totally kicks the shit out of your tastebuds, because at first it's nice and tasty and then BAM! SPICY! But these things are crazy addictive and the price was very nice. 

What is even nicer is that I am a Warrior card member, which gives me 10% off everything, including Happy Hour prices (only until June 31st, however). A great deal for a great meal of appetizers. Our drinks were filled consistently, and the server even boxed up my food for me at the table, and brought out extra fry sauce for me to take home. This was an exceptionally nice visit and I am always glad to come here, even though my fortune cookie (wisely) told me to be frugal. Guess Happy Hour fit that bill!"}
{"text":"I use to love Chang's. We went the other night. My soup came out after our meal (I had to ask for it).  Not too big of a deal.  Then my meal was completely burnt... the manager came over and even said she was embarrassed how badly burnt it was (btw, I'm a person who has only sent food back one other time in my entire 45 year old life). They replaced it with another one which was great but the rest of my family was done eating before I even got my food. Chang's charged me for everything... didn't even offer to comp desert.   Probably won't ever go back to a Chang's again."}
{"text":"We eat here quite regularly. It's a chain, so this location is similar to the rest, so if you have been to another location and liked it this one will not disappoint. It's right near Green Valley, so nice if you want to go shopping then grab a meal it's very handy.
The food is consistent and quite good.
I actually order two things which are no longer on the menu (Crispy Wontons and Chicken in Black Bean) and they always make them for me, which is fantastic."}
{"text":"Seemed like back in the day a night at PF's was a big deal.  Years ago one might travel from one side of the valley to the heart of it on Paradise for some lettuce wraps.  Then the valley grew and PF's popped up in three of the four corners and the heart grew another.

The food is good as it is at every location.  

The service, what can I say...We were visited by at least three different people and with all three got that \"turn and burn\" feeling.   No real hospitality just generic all around service.

Sadly...PF Chang's has become the Applebee's of Chinese cuisine of Chinese cuisine.  I am not hating because Applebee's is good BUT PFCCB just doesn't have the magic it once had."}
{"text":"I need to really fight the urge to keep going back to this location of the PF Changs franchise. You would think that after enduring their often rude service, long waits, and food that is overpriced and small portioned, I would learn!

But no..The most recent visit last night on Christmas Eve may have been my aha moment to go to any other location besides this one. 

When we arrived around 5pm, we knew it would be busy. It was surprising to see no one waiting inside, so when I asked for a table for two, the not so jolly hostess said \"It's going to be 45 minutes to an hour\"...ok, no big deal...but it's THIS place. So I turn to my wife and say...well...maybe spaghetti at home would be more pleasing? When I turned back to the hostess, she said outside seating is available. Hmmm, yeah still not good enough food and drink to endure cold. My wife then had to ask, can we sit at the bar? Only then did the hostess, annoyed, say yes. 

To the food and drink. The egg rolls were greasy and way over cooked. My glass of Malbec was either a concoction of blended wines into one, or it was opened 3 days ago. It was pretty bad - should have went with a Coors Light. 

The Honey Chicken and Moo Goo Gai Pan, the the $13.00 a plate price, just isn't worth it! The Gai Pan had about 5 pieces of very thin chicken. 

I don't know, maybe it's me, but I felt violated with a $50 tab for just so so Chinese food? I know the die hard PF Changer's would disagree. I actually like PF Changs, I just think this location at Norterra is an anomaly. It's like Pei Wei trying to be Changs...it never works."}
{"text":"Went here two times over the last few days, not many vegetarian options on the Strip.

Both times my wife and I ordered some dishes spicy. Both times the dishes came out very bland.

First night the waitress had no social skills. Right after we sat down she was impatient and she wanted us to choose our orders right after we sat down, who does that? Business wasn't booming.

Second night the waitress was much better. Even though the food came out bland again, she at least asked how the food was and offered to get it fixed. She was also very attentive to our needs and was always refilling our water glasses.

I have been to the PF Chang's in San Diego several times and have loved the food each time. Either there is a disconnect and a communication breakdown between the waitresses and the cooks, or the cooks are not preparing the food properly, or the waitresses aren't putting in the orders correctly.

Anyways, I am rambling: the summation is: the food was not tasty.

Chinese food is supposed to be bursting with flavor, even if it's not necessarily a great flavor...it's not supposed to be bland. It's not supposed to be expensive either...but I could deal with that if the food was good.

This was probably the worst PF Changs I have been to in any regard.

But I spare the criticism of our waitress the second time, Janelle. She was solid, attentive and competent. Also, she had social skills and I think she was cute as a button."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and experienced the most professional, efficient, and attentive service we've ever experienced at a restaurant. We were hoping to squeeze dinner in before a movie and we're in an out in 40 min! 

The 3 people working behind the bar were absolutely incredible, two gentlemen with brown hair and a woman with blonde hair. Water was served within a minute of sitting. Food was out within 10. All of this on a busy Saturday night that had a 40 min wait. 

We got the gluten free fried rice and the Kung Pao chicken, it was delicious. 

Props to the entire staff!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile and we decided to change it up for dinner.  I ordered the Buddha's Feast with chicken instead of tofu and it was very blah.  The entire meal was extremely bland and was soaking wet in whatever sauce was on it.  My husband also got a chicken entree and described the chicken as being chewy and dry.  He's not one to be picky with his food and agreed that everything was very plain and substandard.

And as usual, I have to comment on the coffee.  The waitress told us the coffee was probably old and to let her know if she needed to make a new pot.  Ummmm, how about you just make the fresh pot instead of taking the chance of serving us lukewarm, old coffee.  The flavor was also blah, as well.

I never thought I would say this, but I would eat at Pei Wei before I ever eat at PF's again (and I don't think Pei Wei is all the great).  Our bill came to like $60, which is way too much for the quality of food that was served.  We agreed this place will be crossed off our list!"}
{"text":"Two stars because the desserts are amazing! Fried banana, wontons and chocolate cake.
Food was a disaster.
Egg drop soup tastes like soup powder
Dumplings edible
Orange chicken lousy
Chicken satay - shameful.  Laundered chicken on a stick with peanut sauce
If u feel like an awesome dessert go there...."}
{"text":"It's hard to give w place that is a chain 5 stars purely on authenticity. Ambiance was wonderful, the bartender did his best to make a Moscow mule but ended up getting wine instead. My Mongolian beef tasted fantastic but texture of the beef was poor, my husbands sesame chicken was superisngly delightful very light on breading. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive!"}
{"text":"I was taking a course at the Civic Center Library when I received a call from some friends who were in the Phoenix area and asked if they could come over to my house to say hi.  I had nothing in the house to feed them so I decided to drop by PF Chang's and get dinner for the 6 of us.  The hostess told me to go to the bar (behind the hostess station ) toward the right and ask for Jay.  Jay would take my order.  I waited about 10 minutes and no Jay.  Then I overheard a young asian man on the phone saying that he had been there 30 minutes waiting for his food.  I turned around and asked him:  Have you really been waiting 30 minutes for your order?  He said, \"Yeah.  and I called it way ahead of time\".  Knowing that this ridiculous time frame would not work for me and knowing that a dinner order for 6 would take some time if I ever found \"Jay\",  I decided to head for the door.  I stopped at the hostess station to tell her what happened but the \"hostess\" was no where to be found.  I ran into a waitress, explained that I wasn't able to even find this \"Jay\" and that after waiting, I am deciding to leave.  She said, \"OK\",  (no sweat off her back!)  I guess PF Chang doesn't mind losing a take out dinner order for 6 people.  

I am a big fan of PF Chang at Kierland in Scottsdale so I am appauled at this lack of service at this location.  Ironically, this location was half empty so I don't understand why the kitchen was so backed up that take out orders were so delayed.  I didn't even get a chance to put in an order because \"Jay\" the elusive, was no where to be found.  Maybe it was a Godsend that Jay wasn't around and that I didn't put it an order.  It might have been hours before I got the order.  
 
I ended up picking up food at my local chinese restaurant where the cost was half as much as PF Chang.   


Can I give zero stars?"}
{"text":"Now this is a difficult review to do.  THIS P. F. Chang's is my absolute favorite.  So favorite that I joined their loyalty club.  So favorite that I carry P. F. Chang gift cards in mywallet.  I buy them for friends and I buy them for myself.  To say that I am a fan is an understatement. Writing this review is more of a public service to its manager and staff so they know what customers are experiencing.  

Visited Chang's, Veteran's day, for a Saturday evening outing.  Had to wait 30 minutes but that is to be expected on a Saturday night.  Was given a fantastic table/booth that accomodated about 4 people despite the fact that it was only two of us.  Nice.  
Then I felt the cold draft from the vent above.  Moved to the chair facing the booth.  Cold.  Moved to the left of my husband in the hopes that it would be warmer.  Cold.  The waitress said that we could move over one table.  Great.  Still cold from the same vent.  We asked if it would be possible to move to the other side.  YES, was the answer.  YES, YES, Yes!!!  Thank you!   Moved to a table behind my last table.  Still cold-same vent.   They offered a table on the patio.  Yes, Yes. Thank you. 

We sat down and as we waited and waited for our food, the temperature continues to go down.  Now I was cold again.  But wait,  I see standing heaters all around and heaters above my table.  We asked about the heaters and the manager said that the heaters have not yet been inspected so they cant turn them on.  Huh?  So why are they there?  
The people across from us asked for the heater to be turned on and the same answer was given.  Heaters have not been inspected.  
So by now, I was holding the large candle that was on the table in my hands to keep warm.  The waitress saw how cold I was and offered an inside table in a \"warmer\" area of the restaurant.  By now, hubby was NOT A happy camper.  He couldn't believe the heaters could not be turned on or that the air conditioning could not reduced.  I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS COLD.  There was a man there with a ski hat on. (I wished I had taken his photo! )  People with sweaters and jackets.   I do admit that I was not properly dressed for this outing with short sleeves but I never expected this level of cold in a restaurant.  
We ate our food quickly for fear of my catching cold. Literally.  I am a caretaker and can't get sick or I will pass it onto the patient. 
I TOTALLY enjoyed my Salt and Pepper Shrimp.  It is an amazing dish.  Hubby ate his Orange Peel Chicken but felt that there was a ketchup-y flavoring to it that he did not enjoy.  
My rating reflects the awesomeness of my shrimp dish and the efforts that were expended to change my table a number of times.  The best solution would have been to turn on heaters or reduce the level of air conditioning."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight was pretty average. Nothing bad about our meal or service, but nothing out of the ordinary.

I was surprised that there are only 4 vegetarian entrees listed.

The best part was the Tea."}
{"text":"Decrepit insulting hideous excuse for an establishment. My expectations for a place like PF Changs are minimal to begin with and after this experience I will never patronize such a place again. I reserved my sisters 40th birthday celebration including permission to arrive early to decorate as well as bring my own cake. 

Upon arrival, the insightful and ignorant children at the hostess stand gave me a ditzy excuse of \"there's like people still eating and they haven't ordered yet so it will be a wait.\" I informed them that my reservation was for a special occasion and  had been arranged in advance. They agreed to take the dessert to the kitchen for storage and 20 minutes later than told provided me a table of 6 and advised that they would squeeze 8 chairs in to accommodate our reservation.  I took nearly an hour of asking for a server, then for drinks, then for menus, then for place settings before we were even able to enjoy a toast of the champagne I had pre-ordered. After hours of waiting and finally dining, the waiter arrives with a hideous plate of melted ice cream and candle barely standing up as a \"gift.\" I subsequently advised him of the dessert I had provided and was told that he wasn't informed. Ten minutes later he returned stating that the dessert I purchased and brought could not be located. Refer to above with the pathetically ignorant children staffing the hostess stand. After finally finding the desert, our server returned asking me how I would like the cupcakes plated and I requested on a plate with the candles that I provided. Dessert was delivered and ten minutes later I was again requesting plates and silverware in order to eat the dessert. 

The service from the useless girls at the front to the end of the meal having to have requested every item menu to utensil was truly disappointing. 

The manager provided us a free appetizer. When I arrange a special event and buy $87 bottles overpriced champagne, an apology and recognition of your faults would be far more than free edamame. The bartender is the only employee with any sense of service or wit. The manager and the rest of her staff are shameless and one could expect better from the dominoes down the street. 

The kind bartender aside, you are each truly incompetent and awful. Take ownership of that."}
{"text":"I love the lettuce wraps at P.F. Chang's!!! The service at this P.F. Chang's is just okay!! I wish they would be a little bit more attentive and not so unfriendly, we wont bite!! The service can definitely improve, however the food is great!!  So props for that!!"}
{"text":"Flew into Vegas last minute for a family emergency. Luckily things calmed down and we feel all will be ok. We don't have a PF Changs in our town (it's over an hour away) so spotting one here was a huge treat.

Ordered the \"usual\" Changs spicy chicken with white rice. OMG can't get enough. It was perfect with just the right amount of spice. Was disappointed when the trio sauces didn't magically appear like always. Found out you now have to ask for it; too much wasting made them change their policy. 

Over all the atmosphere, service and food was good."}
{"text":"Normally, I'm a fan of PF Changs. This experience was quite mediocre. 

I guess it's because they will get tourists no matter if they're good or bad being on the strip. That is disappointing--I will highly recommend you go somewhere else. You have so many good restaurants in Las Vegas. Even Panda Express if you want Chinese-ish food down the street. If you have access to a car, head over to Chinatown for some good authentic food.

A few unforgiveables here--my tea was lukewarm. That's awful for any restaurant. No one served our soup--another thing that servers do even in the ghetto-ist of Chinese restaurants.... Our server was kind of a ditz as well. 

Sigh... I know I will be back at PF Chang's. Just not this one."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed going here for dinner and/or lunch but their food seems to have dropped off lately. The chunks of meat served up seem to be of a lower quality and are bordering on being just fried pieces of batter. Also, with my last visit the rice was just about crunchy. I know some people enjoy rice being cooked that way but I'm not one of them. The good thing is that the menu here does have a healthy selection of items to choose from and even a Glutton free section. The service is always prompt and very friendly/professional. I just can't get over the last few meals I've had here seeming to drop quality a little and with their prices in the 10-20$ a plate range I would expect better from any restaurant."}
{"text":"Typical pf changs. American Chinese food with a semi twist. This place is a chain so if you had it anyplace in the country it's going to be the same. Sometimes this is what we want. Ergo why I go sometimes."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! Not in a good way either ! Reached out to P.F. Chang's from my room they took the order and advised I come down in 30 minutes. 

I did just that to find a confused waiter asking if my order is possibly under another name to find out they no longer offer the dish I placed an order for! Why didn't the server taking my order know this? 
 
Why didn't anyone page my room to let me know! So disappointed. The communication needs to be improved among the staff, the hotel and with their customers!"}
{"text":"The thing I would say I liked about this spot was that while every other place was crowded, this was not.  So, points for being less busy?

PF Changs is a massive chain and I've been to them once or twice, I have never eaten anything I thought was great.  But a group of people wanted to go and I was powerless to persuade them to try real Vegas cuisine...

Everything is family style which is cool, and it's fun to poke,and grab little bites from this bowl or that.  We had a variety of items, noodles, chicken, veggies.  Everything was pretty fine.

The spicy green beans were quite good.

Our server was really nice and polite and did a fantastic job taking care of us, I'm sorry I can't recall his name.  Five stars for him and his service.

All in all, the food did the trick, it stopped the hangry in the group, and we moved on, no one mentioning it again.  I feel like that happens a lot when you go to PF Changs.  Eat, move on.  Job done.  If that's what you're looking for, this'll do.  Id prefer some place local next time."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed about our visit.  The food was VERY VERY slow. I told a woman in the black trousers that we were in a big hurry and also ordered 1 hour in advance. Regardless, the kitchen was slow and the manager was lackadaisical and didn't seem to care about the fact we were in a large hurry.  I'm EXTREMELY UNHAPPY and we will never come back to this location. 

Also...worse yet, the food was incorrect!!!!  For example, cucumber dish....not spicy at all. Totally different than other restaurants ...waste of money.  Bottom line. Very poor experience. Poor service from the management and incorrect food.

One highlight. The guy who gave us our food was working very hard!"}
{"text":"I used to work here!  Haha, many moons ago tho.  Usually you leave a restaurant job sick of the food and the people but even after I left I still love going in and talking to the staff and getting something to eat and drink and just hanging out.  

I'm a Changs Chicken junkie and I can't stay away from it for too long.  The bartenders have always been some of the best I've ever seen no matter how many changes they've gone through and this is one of the few places where even years and years later the same people work and still love it!  Says a lot about the people.  

Changs Chicken, Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Pork Won Tons though are the standard fare are always amazing.  Some other excellent dishes are Kung Pao Chicken, Shrimp Dumplings, Mongolian Beef and The Ahi Tuna.

It might be a chain restaurant but this one is one of the strongest links in the chain!"}
{"text":"First of all, I think maybe the management of this location reads the reviews because our experience here today was pretty much perfect.  If there were problems in the past, there sure weren't any today.

We ordered the Edamame (orange scented) and it was finger lickin' good.  Instead of an entree, I had the California Rolls and the House Made Eggrolls.  Both were very good and the horseradish type dip for the eggrolls was delicious.  I loved the bite it had to it.  My friend had the Changs Chicken Lettuce Wraps and she totally enjoyed them and had more than enough to take home for dinner later.

Service was very good and the fellow that brought out the edamame had a great attitude and filled my iced tea right away and brought a larger cup for my friend's hot tea.  

Like I said above, it was a very good experience.  I'm totally looking forward to returning asap."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to rate this location fairly low because of my experience a week or so ago.  A group of 7 went in for lunch and the place was not busy (probably because it was St. Patty's day and most irish places were full during lunchtime).  As soon as we got to the hostess stand, who never smiled, she seemed annoyed that a larger group was asking for a table of 7.  She scoffed about having to put two tables together.  Then, when we left, she did not say \"bye\" or \"thank you.\"  Still had the same scowl on her face.  The service was ok in between the hostess's awful attitude.  And, the place does have some good lunch prices.  But, my entire group was turned off from the horrible hospitality, or lack thereof.  Just does not seem right for an establishment to have poor customer service."}
{"text":"The food is typical of what you would get at any PF Chang's locations. What dissapointed us the most was the fact that the food portions are small when we ordered through take-out for the price we paid. We could get the same quantity of food that tastes decent at Panda Express for a fraction of the cost (we paid around $50 here and it would be around $15 at Panda)."}
{"text":"The staff at this location is always on their game  . .. they are professional, knowledgeable and extremely attentive to detail. This is the home of my favorite bartender in charlotte,  Josh. . . Ask him to create a lucky cat martini for you . ..  its not on the menu . .. but oh so good!"}
{"text":"One of the best PFC I have eaten in. Noisy but the food was excellent.  I was sort of blown away how good it was.  I will be back."}
{"text":"PF Changs is to Chinese as Olive Garden is to Italian.  Restaurant is good only if you don't know much about Chinese food.  Quality of food is good and service is also very good.  I have ZERO patience for the waiter droning on and on while they mix sauces at my table."}
{"text":"Fast paced, extremely busy restaurant, wait staff was knowledgable and helpful. Our dining area was dirty when seated but it was cleaned up quickly.   There was a wait time but the line moved quickly.   Bar area well suited for waiting diners.  Food was delicious.  I'd definitely go back again"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai is the worst. We loved everything else. I ate here and later that day I had gasitoeshits.  My farts smelled just like the food I ate, I swear I'm not putting them down, but just saying. I'm ordering more food today as part of a study. There must be a lot of chemicals in their food to preserve the flavor."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a large group.  PF Changs was one of the very few places that was still taking reservations at a decent dinner time.
I figured things would be super slow since the place was totally packed.  But I was wrong.  Service was pretty good, and very fast.  Food was not only consistent, but actually better than PF Changs I've been to.
Also given the fact it was probably one of the cheapest places on the strip for decent food: major awesomeness!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience! Our multiple trips to this PF Chang's are always excellent. They have great servers. Customer service is wonderful. Even when they are busy, I see managers out helping deliver meals. Hostesses are always kind and courteous. Make a reservation though, they are usually busy from 4pm onwards."}
{"text":"We were here for a pre fixe wedding reception, so had no choice what to order (makes sense for a large party). 

For appetizers: The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were very good, especially with some of the hot chili paste mixed into soy sauce as a dipping sauce. The Dumplings (with pork) were tasty, but a little greasy. 

For entrees: No one seemed to care for the veggie dish (Buddha's Feast?) with tofu, broccoli, green beans and mushrooms. The sauce was a little thick and a little too sweet. The Beef with Broccoli was my favorite. The orange chicken was good - crispy with an oniony background. (I'm not sure if this was the \"kids favorite\" Crispy Honey Chicken or the Orange Chicken, since the menu says they peel oranges for this dish, and I didn't see any orange peel, but there was definitely an orange flavor.) The shrimp served on top of crispy rice noodles (Crispy Honey Shrimp, I believe) was good, but the outsides of the shrimp had a slightly strange texture. The lo mein (served meatless) was decent, the rice was perfectly cooked.

Service was very good, something that's not easy with a party of 30."}
{"text":"Food and service are exceptional every time we go. All PF Chang's are that way in my experience. The Sea Bass and anything with their scallops are on my plate!"}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking. \"You went all the way to Las Vegas just to eat at P.F. Chang's?!\"  The answer is yes, but let me explain.

My boyfriend and I were in town while my parents were also there. On some level I guess you could call them high rollers. That's different than being a baller. A baller would drop bills at a really fancy place. Not my parents, although they're not cheap either. Oh, and my grandmother was in Vegas too. She's cool, but simple. Nothing too flashy.

That's where P.F. Chang's comes into the picture.  It's a nice balance of fancy decor and unscale-ish food.  This is a big restaurant with a second floor.  That's where we sat and it was nice to be above the din of the casino.

The prix fixe menu is awesome. That's what Tyler and I chose. Two people get 4 courses for $45.  It turned into a lot of food and everything came out just as it should have (hot and well timed).  My only complaint would be about the batter on the shrimp, but I guess that's to be expected at a chain Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Awful!  Tried PF Chang's a couple of years ago, didn't care for it.  Gave them another try last week and I must say this is by far the worst \"Chinese\" I've ever had.  Started with their blackberry iced tea which was horrible...the only taste was bitter...not a good sign when the restaurant screws up tea.  Next came the egg drop soup that comes with lunch - yuck, unless you like a thick starchy flavorless soup...followed by the worst shrimp with runny flavorless lobster sauce.  My co-workers were equally unimpressed, one said even the egg rolls were bla.  The only good thing on the menu turned out to be desert which was obviously made else where.  If you want good Chinese do yourself a favor and drive down the street to Imperial Garden, you'll pay less and actually enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest and say that I'm already a bit biased about going to restaurant chains, and the most recent visit confirmed why I prefer \"mom and pop\" restaurants. 
I liked the customer service 'cause the guy was nice, checked on us and knew when to give the group space. I just didn't care for the food. 
I had the Pork Jicama Street Tacos and Crab Wontons for the lunch special. Without the sauce, the Wontons seem plain. The pork in my tacos or maybe it was the cooked veggies that were over salted/seasoned. I'll be honest and say that past experiences had food coming out a lot tastier. 
Overall experience was eh..."}
{"text":"Came to this side of town and decided to have dinner here with my family. It was peak dinner time- 6:30pm on a Tuesday evening- packed, but we didn't have more than a 5 minute wait, which was nice. 

We were seated and I'm not sure if P.F. Chang's has recently changed this, but we weren't given the selection of sauces they used to give before. It's been a few years since we came to a P.F. Chang's, so didn't know if that concept still existed, but there wasn't as much as any salt or pepper on our table. 

Our server was very friendly, but when we asked him for some hot sauce/chili oil, it took him a good 15 minutes to bring it to us, at which time we had already chowed down. 

The size of our entree- Mongolian beef- which we paid around $14 for, was definitely smaller compared to what we had gotten before. Was quite disappointed by the fact that the pieces of meat didn't even cover the entire bottom of the serving dish. We also got the Hokkein noodles, which was enough for three people. 

The restaurant is in a very nice area with other shops and restaurants in The Waterfront in West Homestead."}
{"text":"Lettuce wraps rule! Other than that pretty average. Nothing super spectacular. Good tastey food and average prices."}
{"text":"The food was actually good, but there was a major problem which was not handled well.  My company had food brought in by PF Chang's via the Fooda catering program. I ordered the Black Pepper Steak and sat down to eat with several co-workers. While eating I discovered a piece of some kind of metal wire in the food; it was approximately a half inch in length. I presented this to the woman who was taking payments for the food. She asked what food I'd gotten, and then said \"Thanks. I'll let our manager know about it.\" I didn't see any effort by them to make sure there weren't any further problems with the food, and they continued to serve it as though nothing was wrong. This disregard for the safety of customers is disconcerting. I also informed the person in our company who handles these arrangements with outside food vendors, and hope that someone will actually be held accountable."}
{"text":"Made a RESERVATION for 6:45....got seated by 7:10pm...served a glass of wine & ordered our food right on the spot.  8pm & still no food. Here comes the manager to apologize & the waitress says they have had issues like this since the holidays. Bottom line, we walked out at 8:10pm with nothing."}
{"text":"Great dinner as usual. Just don't get the lobster tacos. More batter than lobster.. The hostess asked if we wanted to sit outside on the patio. Are you f*in kidding me?!??  It's 100° outside. Other than that great time. Great waiter..  Forgot his name."}
{"text":"What can I say? It's P.F. Chang's. The food is delicious but the quality of the food is pretty mediocre. I usually regret eating here the day after, but it's so delicious at the time! The best thing they have going for them is the online ordering with curbside pickup. I can place my repeat custom order in a couple clicks, drive up to one of the curbside parking spots for pickup, and they come to me with my food very quickly. 

The service here has always been very good, and the gluten free menu is pretty large so I can convince myself that I'm sticking with my Paleo diet even though I think we all know cavemen didn't have Chinese takeout. (One could also make the argument that P.F. Chang's doesn't have Chinese takeout either...Bazinga!)"}
{"text":"I had a craving for some honey shrimp and while out running errands with the GF thought we would come in and pay P F Chang's China Bistro a visit.  It has been some time since I have been to this particular location.  

We rolled in about the middle of the lunch hour and were seated in quick fashion.  The lay out was pretty much as i had remembered it.  The service was friendly and hardly overwhelmed.  I did silently question why the service was not fluid and there were  rather long pauses between drink refills, the appetizer and meal, and check.

We ordered up some crab wontons.  They were tasty.

The GF had a the combo lo mein.  It was tasty.

I had my honey shrimp.  It was also tasty.

Over the years it seems the price has remained the same but the portions have become smaller.

With my craving satisfied and partaking in an A-OK experience, it could be a few more years before I return again."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a busy Saturday night at 7pm and were told the wait was 90 minutes. They take your cell
# so we were able to do some shopping while we waited. Fortunately they called us after an hour. I had the steamed pork dumplings which were delicious and a perfect ratio of filling and dough, with a chili sauce on the plate. I also had the lobster avocado roll which was also delicious, especially the cream sauce that had a great umami flavor.
Service was good and quick and the restaurant appeared clean despite being packed. Even though this is a chain it's a good stop when you're in the mood for something different."}
{"text":"If you're familiar with PF Chang's and their look, you probably wouldn't recognize this one in the SouthPark area.  To blend in any strict SouthPark codes, the restaurant looks like every other building in the area on the outside with just their name added.  Not until you get up to the front door (hidden in a breezeway) do you begin to recognize the establishment.  

I've been to this PF Chang's a few different times and had varied experiences.  The first few times were good, as expected.  Then I had the most crazy experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  The hostess pulled a superiority card and said she couldn't seat our party of five for 45 minutes because there were no tables available to accommodate our size.  I pointed several out to her and she shrugged her shoulders.  That's right:  she shrugged her shoulders at me.  I guess nobody taught her how to count and spot empty tables before, so my logic blew her away.  I wrote a letter and got an immediate response from the GM who was very apologetic and invited us back.  We did give them another try and have been back a couple of times since.  

Our return visits have been very good.  The food always tastes delicious and the service was excellent, too.  The chicken lettuce wraps are on the appetizer menu, but they make a fantastic meal for one.  I feel like I'm eating so healthy -- yet so tasty -- when I choose them.   If I'm really hungry, I go for the Ginger Chicken with Broccoli or Ground Chicken with Eggplant.  It's tough to decide between the two for me.  And usually it's white rice for me as an accompaniment (instead of their other option of brown rice).  I tried the Orange Peel Chicken once, not realizing how much orange peel they really put in the entree.  Ever eaten a lot of orange peel?  It's bitter.  And totally ruins the flavor of the meal.  And there isn't enough soy sauce in the world to correct it.  So what did I learn?  Orange Chicken good.  Orange PEEL Chicken bad.  

One of my favorite touches at PF Chang's is that they offer a variety of sauces at the tables.  You can mix your own combination of oil, vinegar, hot mustard, soy sauce, and chili pepper sauce if you want to...or just go straight for the chili pepper sauce solo and let the heat take over.  YUM.  

The last time we were there, we splurged and got dessert, too?  Why?  They were tiny and calling our names.  For about $2, you can order a mini dessert (about two spoonfuls in a shotglass) just \"for a taste.\"  That way, you get the flavor without all the calories!  I tried 3 different ones -- and, mind you, I LOVE chocolate -- but the carrot cake one (with cream cheese frosting) was my favorite.

p.s. I rated PF Chang's not good for kids because they don't have kids' menus."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's never disappoints. The vibe feels upscale, but isn't too expensive or dressy. Some people wear shorts and others are in ties. 
The crispy green beans are to die for! And the sushi is fabulous. The Kung Pao Dragon Roll was a tad spicy, but delicious!
You can take a large group or sit at the bar with a friend. This restaurant works for all scenarios."}
{"text":"You need to try out the Lobster with fry rice.  Gabriela and Brenna are the best servers here !!!"}
{"text":"Better than most PF's I have eaten at in CA. Decent service and the food is good."}
{"text":"Three cheers to PF Chang's!! Went there with 6 more friends last weekend. Sunny weather, outdoor seating, and a friendly waitress made our lunch extra special.
With a hangover from Friday night partying, no breakfast, hundreds of people queuing up for hotel buffets, PF Chang's was a true savior.
This was my second visit to this place at Planet Hollywood. While the first one was a dinner date with my husband, this one was a lunch with friends. Both experiences were equally great.
With soups, starters, entrees, and desserts for 7 people (we had to get doggy packs too), the bill was under 100$!!!!
Dishes to die for:
Hot n sour soup
Chicken lettuce wrap
Dan dan noodles
Dali chicken (for the spicy food lovers)
Chocolate cake with raspberry syrup (I am not a chocolate fan but this was yum!!)
Great service, good food, friendly staff, value for money, and above all NO WAITING on a weekend :).
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"A group of my colleagues and I went here for dinner about a week ago and it wasn't a great experience. Our waiter Stephen lied to us and said that he couldn't split the bill when we asked him to at the beginning (there was a group of 10 of us). My food was fine but there was inconsistency with some of the orders like one sweet and sour chicken had a lot of pineapple while another didn't have any pineapple. When it came time to pay Stephen brought one check and the manager walked by and he said that we could split the bill. Stephen handed us a pen and told us to notate on the bill who got what so he could split it... He didn't want to lose the gratuity that was built in to the bill nor did he want to take the time to split it even though he should have been keeping track of who ordered what... The manager did apologize and did give out group a gift card for the trouble since of the guys in our group covered the bill. The experience wasn't worth it so I will not be a returning customer nor will most of the people in our group."}
{"text":"Jovani was a great fast server! Great personality, the food came fast! Tasted great! I recommend. Good size servings to. I had the pho inspired dish with shrimp and steak , delish! Mongolian beef , Yum! Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Great experience ! Good place to have a date , food was good and they have a reasonable deal for a party of two, comes with two cups of soup , one appetizer an  two entrees plus two tiny desserts for 39.95 perfect amount  for two .The best part was the awesome friendly and accommodating bartender his name was Brian ! Kinda pricey but over all good defiantly will go back an hopefully Brian will be there !"}
{"text":"Shared dinner for two with the three of us. All of us are full and have a couple lunches for tomorrow. Just waiting for dessert!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. I haven't been happy with Pei Wei lately yet Chang's is consistent. Sometimes I go inside but lately I have been using their curbside to go. You can call in your order or order online like I do. Compared to other places that offer curbside Chang's has it down. I'm never left waiting passed the promised pick up time and the person bringing out the food is courteous and goes over the whole order ensuring it's all there. 

The pork fried dumplings are super bomb. Great flavor and highly addicting. Chicken lettuce wraps from here are some of the best I've had. I change up between a few different beef dishes but it's always something spicy, beefy, tasty, and over white rice. The portions are good and vary like price depending if it's from the lunch or dinner menu."}
{"text":"Ambiance
Very modern and top notch.  We had a team dinner here for a conference.  It definitely felt like a wine room before this was a P.F. Chang's restaurant.  

Food
The Chinese American food felt fresh and made when ordered.  Definitely a lot of salt in each dish as expected for Chinese food.    

Service
This is Las Vegas so the customer service is always top notch.  New plates and new silverware for every dish with the pre fixed menu."}
{"text":"Good Food. Noisy,Great Staff.
1/2 hr late being seated for reservation, but manager brought out bowl of fruit to keep my 4 yr old from loosing it. They kept us informed often, an apologized.  Manager paid for all 3 of our appetizers. 
Waitress was super nice and made 2 great recommendations.  Kung pao shrimp still the best I've ever had.

Got 20% off the bill in our Chinese New Year card.  Great night."}
{"text":"Not a fan! Expensive and small portions! Combinations would be nice. My wife has an allergy and she can only eat off there Gluten Free menu. That is why the wife loves them. rice and chicken is cheap to make and they charge $14 a small plate. $4 for 2 egg rolls is a joke and that's happy hour price. I guess it will a ladies place from now on.

I only went because I received a gift card. I knew of these issues 10 years ago. It's not better!"}
{"text":"This PF Chang's hosted a family-style dinner for our group of 47 celebrating a UNLV event. Arranging the plan went super smoothly (shoutout to Asa), and the view of the strip from the setup they provided was spectacular. Food and service were both outstanding (shrimp with walnuts and melon, and the cheesecake desserts were big hits), and I received happy feedback from the attendees. Thank you! You made me look like a rockstar :-)"}
{"text":"No doubt that P.F. Chang's is my favorite restaurant with the favorite street noodle, black pepper chicken and my spicy chicken noodle soup but this time I would like to give all the credits of my review to our outstanding server who served us so well with on time checking on our table and yes he didn't forget any of our enormous requests. Thank you Kevin! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night where there was a 35-minute wait.  Friends asked that we meet them there.  Service, as usual, was terribly slow--15 minutes to get our water and then another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  The food took forever to arrive, but was pretty tasty.  It was an over 2-hour generally poor experience.

I think I've finally learned my lesson and will never return."}
{"text":"Today we decided to order take out and chose pf Chang's. Well we have not orders food from here for about 2 1/2 years and it was in Colorado. To our surprise we called in and they pulled up our previous order, knew my wife's name and gave us a time it would be ready. I was blown away. We didn't even give them our number they pulled it up,automatically with caller id. I was actually lost for words for a minute. What service."}
{"text":"I like this place.  I know it has its critics.  We had a nice lunch today.  We ordered something called lettuce wraps and some pork dumplings to start.  The lettings thingys and the dumplings were tasty.  I ordered the Lo Mein with chicken.  It was really good.  I would have loved their chicken soup, but with two appetizers already that would be to much food.  The server Logan did a great job too.  I like this place and recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Service is terrible! Came in tonight, was seated right away. Took waitress 15 min to get our drinks; watched her flirt with bartender the whole time. Ordered an appetizer that took almost 20 min to come. So disappointed! Usually the food is amazing but we received over cooked chow mein noodles , soggy honey crispy chicken, and continued POOR SERVICE! I will never come to this location again! Try the Planet Hollywood location!!"}
{"text":"Its been a while since I've been, and the quality has decreased substantially. Everything was too salty, the California roll.... Wasn't a California roll. It used crab salad."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food. Friendly staff and a nice decór. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Changed the sauces again to low sodium and complete change to the taste.  Went to order an espresso and the machine has been down for months.  Well good job corporate pfchang's. The place is empty and people are going else where to eat.  Go back to basics and how you opened with amazing food not this slop you are serving now and fix the shit that is broken.  Maybe I will be back then."}
{"text":"Excellent! Made reservations but were about 10 minutes late due to the parking around mill ave..walked in and walked past others waiting, sure enough they had a booth not a table just as I requested! Which on a busy Friday night is lucky anyway. We had drinks n soup on our table literally within 5 minutes of walking in, appetizer came out just as we finished our soup, and the meal followed right on time! Hot n fresh food and an excellent waitress, perfect! We'll b back."}
{"text":"You might not think of PF Chang's as a cheap place to eat... unless it's happy hour that is.  The restaurants happy hour goes from 3-6pm and includes wine and cocktails for $6 and $5-$6 small plates.  

What makes this place work for a couple to save money is the chicken lettuce wraps which for $6 provide a good amount of food for two and when combined with one other small plate like crab wontons for $5 makes a meal for two $11 plus tax and tip.  

Of course if your looking to turn the world a bit sideways the drinks at $6 each will hit your wallet in the end...  but it's a chill higher-end environment with good food and strong drinks so it's hard to go wrong during happy hour until you start saying \"ohhh one more drink...\"."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a few months.  Had a guest with us and was disappointed.  No one greeted us when we arrived and when she did, it was obvious we intruded on her time!  The restaurant was less than half full and the service was mediocre at best.  We even got the bill for another table.  The waiter said the mgr would correct it.  It would've been nice to see the mgr, but that never happened.  Too bad , however it may be a long time before we return.

{"text":"I ordered the Changs chicken and left hungry. I read a couple reviews saying the portion sizes were large. This was not my experience. I'm a regular sized dude and this was really a paltry plate of chicken. Way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"This is the absolute driest most overcooked chicken I have ever tried. I ordered from the Green Valley location as my job is nearby... I didn't want cheap Chinese or else I would have went to panda express. The broccoli is the only decent thing on this plate. And for your child like portion size this food should be off the chain. The sesame chicken was a disappointment PF Chang's...What does the PF stand for??? Poorly Fried. I am absolutely appalled. Who knows if I with ever be back. Smh"}
{"text":"Excellent northern style ribs, Brussels sprouts, and shrimp fried rice. Food is ALWAYS perfect and the wait staff is personable. Must for Chinese food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times, but my most recent dining experience was the best. My friend and I usually have date nights here and this time, we decided to come early for the happy hour. I ordered Red Sangria which was alright. Honestly, I enjoyed eating the cherries and strawberries more after I drank it all. Our waitress, which we later learned was on her first shift, was phenomenal! She continually checked on us, and she introduced us to the preferred program. While we eat here occasionally, we did not know about the program until yesterday thanks to her. Moreover, the manager came over to check on our dining experience which was nice. 

I guess I'm pretty boring, because I get the same thing either: Mongolian Beef or Beef Lo Mein; they're just so good, I can't resist. Now, we're even more excited to return knowing that we're working our way up to a free entree."}
{"text":"The one star is for our server Joshua but Erin the female manager is a scammer and a thief.  She scammed us into ordering paid items that would have prompted free meals. After the server brought part of it out, she reneged on the deal and expected us to pay for the items that were brought out. When I can cancelled the order she then stole my points off my card as if I received the free meal. This is the short version of what happened but the basics. I believe she just didn't want my kind to get the free meals and it was apparent by her choice of words and temperament. Her tone was also loud enough to try to embarrass us in front of the other diners to make it seem as though it's just typical of us. Her skills are limited to a failing fast food chain."}
{"text":"This place just doesn't do it for me.  

Located in the District off of Green Valley, it's easy to see from the road.  Parking is definitely plentiful.  We were greeted and seated immediately in their large dining area.  Service was just ok.  I think our waiter was more interested in talking with his friends who were sitting at the table next to us.  He was very distracted.  

I ordered a glass of their 'Moscato' to start.  I put that in quotes because it really wasn't Moscato.  I don't know if they mixed up their wines but it was more of a Riesling if anything else.  I didn't finish it.  For my meal I wanted to try their Ma Po Tofu.  This dish was crispy silken tofu tossed in garlic red chili sauce over broccoli.  Again I was unimpressed.  The lack of the nearly flavorless sauce used was the downfall.  The only good thing about the entree was the steamed broccoli.  

I guess I know why there were so many open tables on a Saturday night.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is decent but they need to look at improving their business model in how they manage their take out service. 

I understand that when your busy challenges arise however when you give us a conformation number and lose the order and then find it then when your inside trying to pick up and pay for the order and then are delayed because the employee is outside looking for you and once you connect the order is completely wrong does not make me want me want to use this service or eat at your restaurant again.

Other chain restaurants have a better operating plan for this type of service."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience I have ever endured at a restaurant. We waited for an hour after visiting the hostess three separate times to ensure that we were on the list. Not only I guess we're the dumb customer for assuming that we being taken care of. Their hostess team is brutal and did not even have the courtesy to ask if we were being taken care of. 


Really bad experience, we left after they tried placing us on the cold patio. Beyond upsetting for a family outing on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Always great.  Orange chicken with fried rice, and Im in heaven!"}
{"text":"OK, I like PF Changs in general. But this one is especially cool, considering the location and the view. I like sitting on the second floor by the window. We had the black pepper chicken, which was just spicy enough.

Also, it's right across the street from the cosmopolitan. That place is awesome, but the restaurants are mostly trendy and overpriced."}
{"text":"Pf Chang's just can't get it right.  

It took me a month to get back here.  I finally did.  Take out again as usual.  I called in.  They remembered my order, as all aloha systems do regarding takeout orders.  Fine.  Pad Thai again with a certain amount of fear because of the last experience.

Upon arrival, I choose to inspect my order.  Greeted by a nervous bartender and manager.  

They both looked at me like I was violating some takeout rule.  I told them I had a bad experience last time.  I need to check the order.  I likened it to when you're slumming it and have to check your burger before you leave the drive thru.  

The manager, never introduced himself, was wearing a blue and white vertical striped shirt and a black suit.  

He asked me what had happened upon the last take out.  I told him the noodles were in pieces.  Chopped up.  He literally tossed a free appetizer card over the bar.  I tossed it back.  He returned the motion.  I felt like we were playing air hockey at a certain point.  

You will find no personal service from this location.

While walking out, I saw a woman sleeping in a booth.  Literally, curled up.  Food still on the table.  Is she an employee?!  And if so, why is Mr. Manager allowing this impression?!! Get your shit together Pf.!!!"}
{"text":"The Happy Hour is fabulous.  The food is always fanastic.  The service is occasonally slower than other restaurants, but worth the wait.  
I am not impressed with the seating hostess, too young and uncaring.
Food 5 stars.
Service 3 stars.
Desserts 5 stars."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's has gone downhill in my opinion.  The wait staff was less than eager to be cordial. They weren't sure if they could make a Forbidden Tea which is on the menu at some locations elsewhere. They were able to make the drink but without the chai tea.  $9.50.  Holy crap.  Food was lukewarm and average tasting.$40 for one person to eat/drink there at a typical chain restaurant?  Never again."}
{"text":"I didn't know Panda Express served food in porcelain plates."}
{"text":"I like this location on Paradise since it fits for most people I work with and it's on the way to the airport, so my four stars is inclusive of convenience.  As far as the food goes it's consistent with any PF Chang's chain and while not authentic or unique I do like that they accommodate lunch portions within a section on their menu.  Aside from my usual favorite of the lettuce wraps during my last visit I tried the ribs which was a nice way to mix it up.  My usual entree is the lo mein noodles that never disappoint."}
{"text":"My husband and I were frequent customers at PF Changs.  Usually we came for the happy hour and appreciated being able to dine anywhere in the restaurant. The food, beverages and service was usually very good.   The other night we stopped by for happy hour and were informed we either had to eat outside or at the bar (not just in the bar area but at the bar counter).  Neither option was acceptable so we left and went elsewhere.  There were hardly any occupied tables in the main restaurant area.  Too bad, they lost a regular happy hour customer."}
{"text":"Oh, Kung Pao, what did they do to you? You are a salty mess. If I were suffering from a salt-deficiency, then you would be perfect, but as I am in relatively good health and prefer to stay that way... I will have to find my Kung Pao fix elsewhere.

As for the rest of the experience, was most of the food good? Sure! Our other meals were tasty, you could tell care was taken in making the dishes.

Was the service good? Yes, our server was great! Very friendly and attentive and friendly to our children as well.

On the other hand, the hostess seemed completely disinterested and apathetic. Shouldn't that be the welcoming face and voice you are greeted with when entering a restaurant? Why is a poor experience at the doorway allowed to happen? She was not unkind, but just completely without emotion... which left us feeling unwelcome.  While not excusable, PF Changs is not alone. In fact, it's too pervasive in many restaurants today. Why many restaurants choose to look the other way for this type of behavior is beyond me. It's one of the basic job criteria. You either meet it or you don't."}
{"text":"Called in tonight for take out. We were told our small order would take 50 minutes...huh? That's awhile! Then learned it would take 80 minutes. 80 minutes for take out! Sorry. There is better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the dishes and the flavors. Sure...its not China Town like in NYC (which is the best) but it is steady all the time and wonderful. Sure, you can go cheap and get their frozen dishes at Walmart...and they are good... but when you want some really good Chinese, thai food and best lettuce wraps this side of the great wall....go here."}
{"text":"Easy to give them 1 star and move on.
The frozen PF Changs from grocery freezer is better than this place."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! We were a party of 16 and we really enjoyed ourselves. The food was delicious and came fairly quickly. We visited at dinner time on a Monday and it was not packed. It was nice that it was quieter in there. P.F. Changs has a great, relaxing and classy ambiance.

Our food, like I said earlier was fabulous! We ordered a mix of things and shared them. Our server said that the portions were for about two people family style, but we would disagree. We are Italian and believe that we each could have finished our meals we ordered without any issue. They were larger portions than any other chain restaurant. 

We ordered potstickers as an appetizer and I don't normally like pork, but these were amazing. Also when our main dishes came, the server brought out an extra entree that she said was made in back on accident. This was a great surprise and also very tasty! We had a great server, she was attentive, but not overbearing. We ordered dessert, both a chocolate cake and a dessert drink and both were equally as delicious as the meals. 

Definitely a five star in my book from this experience!"}
{"text":"Went to PF Chang's on a weeknight evening. They did not have sufficient staff even though it was not terribly busy. That lead to us waiting for a table for 20 minutes though there were several open tables. Once we were seated it took a very long time to get service and once we ordered it took very long to receive our order. Our food arrived and they had gotten my order wrong. So they took my food away to remake it but my husband felt he couldn't eat until I had gotten mine. The manager noticed that I didn't have food and cAme to inquire. He quickly fixed the problem but then the server assumed I had complained about the wrong order and was short and unfriendly after. The food itself was delicious once it was correct."}
{"text":"I think it may be possible that we are eating out too much!--  With that being said.  I called and made a reservation for 7pm on Saturday night.  We showed up to a crowded waiting area and checked in with the hostess.  She proceeded to hand me a pager.  I thought to myself \"Wth? I thought we had a reservation?\".  We sat down and waited about 3 minutes and we were them promptly seated in a booth.

  I think the booth makes a big difference here because the tables are very close together.  The tables are so close that I feel like I am having dinner with the people at the next table.  Anyway, the booth is super nice. 

Roxanne was our server.  She was polite and friendly.  We decided to try the two dinners for $39.95.  We started with soups and they were very tasty.  We then had Chicken Lettuce Wraps which were also good.  I forgot to mention my wife had a white wine spritzer and I had a beer(both good).  The main course was Sweet and Sour Pork and Mongolian Beef and they were both excellent.

Our experience here was near perfect!   We had a great meal with two drinks and our tab was $60.00 including tip......"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Our food came out with black curly hair on it and the waiter was not only unapologetic he also left the lobster roll on the table with the hair while he went to take another tables order.  The manager also wasn't very apologetic besides saying \"sorry\". Love PF Chang's but you can tell this location is geared towards tourists (we are locals) and don't care if people return to their establishment.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Always consistent and good. We have been coming to Changs for years and always been more than satisfied. On this trip we had the Korean BBQ Chicken, Beef a la Szechuan and Chicken Fried Rice. Great combo of spicy and sweet with lots of vegis. Definitely recommend the combo."}
{"text":"I've been to this particular location a number of times, and I'm usually perfectly satisfied. Like with all chain restaurants, this is just like all of the many other P.F. Chang's restaurants across the country. The review will be focused specifically on the unique qualities of this location, although it's notable that the quality, variety, and overall enjoyability of the food are all excellent. 

For this location, I knocked one star off because on a few occasions we've had an exorbitant wait, or had mistakes with our food. The staff is always polite and considerate, and even on a weekend night they (usually) being the food without too much of a wait. 

I really enjoy the layout of this restaurant. There's no awkward corner tables where you're hidden and forgotten about, and it doesn't feel overly crowded even with a full house. There's plenty of bar seating, and the decorations are tasteful and lovely. They do a good job of keeping the sun and bright light from being overly intrusive with shades on the windows and tinted doors, which I appreciate. It keeps the restaurant open and well lit without being super annoying or sitting in an unfortunate spot where you're blinded. 

Even with the many restaurant options in the Boca Park area, I wouldn't hesitate to revisit this P.F. Chang's."}
{"text":"Poor effort on this site. I've had much better meals at other PF Chang's. Should have been more consistent with food. Not busy at all, but the service was extremely slow."}
{"text":"If you like high end Chinese food, this location is for you! I love to treat my clients to dinner here to discuss buying/selling a home. Their food is delicious, service is fast and atmosphere is very relaxing. I would definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"As a chain, PF Changs is reliable, you always get what you expect and we've been to a few locations around the country.

Love this place for happy hour, though this location can get very busy. We love the pork dumplings, salt and pepper prawns, spicy green beans, shaking beef. Really never had anything there that wasn't good. Love the fixins they bring to make a spicy sauce, but I love to make my own. Service here is always good."}
{"text":"Their food is consistently good and it's a great atmosphere.  Prices are a bit high, but the dinner for two option is a good deal.  I've had mixed experiences with service at this location.  On my first visit, the bartender was outstanding.  Fast service and super friendly.  Then I went for dinner with my husband last night (Saturday) and the bar waitress was downright surly... But usually it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Everything was good quality. The signature spicy chicken was not spicy. The Mongolian beef was good. Server was good. Women 's bathroom stall needs fixed, men's needs hand towels. Tiffany, the bartender was terrific."}
{"text":"Overall was disappointed with food quality and waiter service. Was seated right next to entrance/exit of the kitchen which made dining uncomfortable also."}
{"text":"I am not much on chain restaurants but this place is a fave every time I'm on that side of town.  It's dark, cool, and a nice place to while away a hot summer afternoon.  I was there yesterday with one of my besties and was craving the dynamite shrimp.  Holy cow, they are so addictive and are served in a champagne glass!  So cute and tasty.  I was also craving chicken-fried rice, which I haven't had in over 20 years.  OMG, it was just heavenly and gave me plenty of leftovers for lunch on Monday.  Lastly, our server recommended the Lemon-Coconut sour and it was just spot on!  Cool, refreshing, slightly tart.....yummy :)  Chang's, keep doing what you do because it's all good!"}
{"text":"I have been to Pf Changs many times. It is by far not my favorite restaurant but they do have good food. It is for sure one of those restaurants that everyone needs to at least try a couple times. It is not usually a place I pick to go to but. It tends to be the place my friends pick when we all go out. It is always over crowded no matter which location you go to. I honestly have not decided if it is over priced yet or if the prices are right on. The food is tasty but not close to being authentic Chinese that I am used to from back home. They do have the original lettuce wraps that every place seems to have now and certainly no one else can match. They do have some great desserts as well. Ultimately they are to good for just three stars and maybe not quite four stars but they are definitely somewhere in between."}
{"text":"Our server Jordan, was awesome. He was very attentive and had a great demeanor. He offered his favorite dish, which we tired and it was delicious. If you get a chance get the Wok Fried Filet Mignon, it was amazing. Very flavorful, meat was tender, potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside,  definitely worth it. My husband and I had a great time."}
{"text":"Ugh I had such high hopes even after reading these reviews before ordering :( our food was less than satisfactory . My GF's dry rubbed ribs were horrible & almost stale tasting . I guess the \"dry\" didn't just explain the rub on this one . My Kung Pao chicken wasn't terrible but it did not meet the family size portion as described . The best part of our meal was the cheesecake & pork dumplings . Being in the service industry nothing upsets me more than spending almost $70 on a subpar meal . I used to love PF Chang's but I'm sorry to say we won't be back ."}
{"text":"I recently visited P.F. Chang's Tempe location for the first time during a lunch meeting.  I found the service to be acceptable and efficient, and the food I ordered - Wonton Soup & a Cucumber, Tomato Side Salad - to be very flavorful!  While I prefer the Scottsdale location best, the Tempe locale provided a nice 2nd convenient alternative."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Bellagio hotel earlier in the week and we came here to grab a quick bite, nothing fancy. We sat on the bar and ordered one beer and one sushi roll. The service was awful. It took them a while to take our order. They also forgot about the sweet & sour sauce that I ordered. The people behind the bar seem unorganized. the food was average."}
{"text":"3 strikes and you're out would describe my experience with takeout here. Long waits for my food each time only to find out they forgot to put in my order or let it sit in the back for 10+ minutes getting cold. But that would be forgivable if the Pad Thai I ordered each time was actually any good. It's a staple, basic dish for an Asian restaurant! Yet when I order it here it has absolutely no flavor, not to mention it definitely wasn't cooked to be extra spicy as I'd ordered it! I even thought they'd accidentally left off the sauce the first time until I gave the dish one more try... and same thing, NO FLAVOR AT ALL. To make it even worse, the chicken was breaded and overcooked as if they'd thrown in some leftover chicken from a different dish. Fail. I wish they'd replace PF with a Pei Wei. At least Pei Wei knows how to cook dishes better and for less $. No more takeout for me from this place again."}
{"text":"Yes it's a huge chain restaurant but I still like it! They are consistent & I have my favorite items on the menu which I always get because I don't come here that often. 
For couples they have a $40 deal with an appetizer, 2 main courses & mini dessert which always works out well. 
This place is casual & near our house so it's convenient. One of my favorite items from the menu is the hot & sour soup which I always order:"}
{"text":"This is a good location to go for a business lunch, particularly if you can secure one of their huge booth tables.  You can fit about six or seven people in at one of those tables, which is pretty good.  

The service is hit or miss here, however.  Sometimes they just seem a little understaffed or perhaps the staff just doesn't care some days.  I have been trapped in lunch situations where it has taken more than an hour from sitting down to paying the bill.  When you only have an hour for lunch, this creates a problem.

I chow down on the chicken salad here, which is great.  The dressing is light and delicious.  I always get a hot green tea and a glass of ice to make my own iced green tea.  Just tastes better than their premade green tea from that giant machine.  The chicken dishes are all pretty good and the fried rice is great."}
{"text":"Here at planet Hollywood for work. I was starving and tired from my 5 hour plane ride so didn't feel like going far. I don't usually like going to chains when traveling - I prefer visiting to local small places that have good reviews. But out of laziness I ordered carry out to eat in my room. 

The service was helpful and fast!  And the food was delicious, savory, and hit the spot. Would recommend to any Vegas tourists wanting a yummy meal!"}
{"text":"Really , worst Chinese restaurant I have ever been to. The fast food Chinese restaurants are MUCH BETTER than this amazingly poorly chain . From the service to the soup , to the sauces, to every detail, it is the cheapest desquiting restaurant, much bluff with the vulgar mediocrity of the ambiance, loud music that represent a real fast food chain restaurant , servers inexperienced in both: serving and Chinese cuisine....No, I would not recommend this to anyone....I been to another one of these in Mexico city, there it was a little better, but still, a poor chain of \" Chinese\" food very poorly cooked, not for sophisticated palates. I would rate it 1/2 star. Yaiks, and the prices are so ridiculous for the quality. DON\"T go there! Seriously!"}
{"text":"I wish I could post zero stars but no such luck.  Ordered a curb side order New Year's Eve at 5.40 pm and was told to pick up at 7.15.  It's all good.  Send my daughter to pick up and they are super busy. She waits and waits.  I call at 8.05 And talk with the manager Guermo? Spelling.  He checked into it, called me back, comped the order which was great. Got the order home and the chicken orders were cold and the rice order was GROSS. It literally looked like slop hat was left over. What a disappointment.  Even free is was not with it"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed both the food and the atmosphere here. The chicken lettuce wraps on the appetizer menu are one of my favorite items. Nice service when sitting at the bar and I always need a takeout container for leftovers."}
{"text":"3 stars instead of 4 for high prices and limited servings sizes. 

First let me say that the area where this restaurant is located is full of crime, hints the security guard on constant foot patrols in the parking lot. 

When we (family and I) walked in we were greeted and then seated promptly. The dining area was clean. The server, which I've forgotten his name resembles Mark Anthony very closely. Anyways, the server was very attentive and patient. The food was very fresh and tasty.

The only down side was somehow, a homeless person made it inside the restroom where you smell bad body odor before seeing him. 

Good restaurant, probably not a good location, at some point I will probably be returning, lol."}
{"text":"This PF Changs has such a classy feel to it. I felt relaxed and really enjoyed the ambiance. The new munu is much easier to read and has a nice flow. We just missed Happy Hour, but it looks like there are some really good drinks and specials! We sat at the bar, which was really clean and we had spectacular service from Brian and Ryan. I like how they write the batender's names on a card so you know who they are. Seemed to provide a more personal touch. I had wine, hubby had beer. Nice, clean glasses. I'm glad they have Veggie options here! Had coconut tofu, which was perfection. The oolong seabass he ate even looked good to me! It was on a bed of this really good looking spinach, cooked just right. We were too full for dessert, so didn't have any of that.
It really was an awesome dining experience. The noise level, lighting, and decorations were just perfect."}
{"text":"Why did you change your Mongolian beef recipe. The rice was hard. The lettuce wraps were good."}
{"text":"You go to this place if you enjoy extremely long wait time even when there is hardly any customers and/or you enjoy poor staff attitude. Avoid otherwise."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place :) My love took me there my first time for our anniversary and it was amazing!! I was a little stunned at how busy it was and having to wait about 45 minutes for a table and it was pretty crowded. We were sat at a tiny table for two which ordinarily fine however with the plates and sauces that they serve there was barely room to eat. The wait staff was amazing and the food was the best! We went again for my birthday this year and the experience was even better. We got a booth this time and plenty of room for everything. It can be a little pricey but if your looking for a great romantic dinner with amazing food, this is the place :)"}
{"text":"WOW.  The service here is GREAT!!  I called for reservations for 5pm.  I got there at 5 pm.  And I was sitting at my table before 5:01 came.  The waitress was great.  The food came out in lighting fast fashion.  The food was great and the dessert was freshly made.  I definitely recommend this PF Changs."}
{"text":"Madison is not a great town for Chinese food--nothing remotely comparable in authenticity or diversity of regional cuisines to what one finds in major coastal cities, and most options are watered down to relatively unadventurous midwestern tastes. Thus, commentary on P.F. Chang's lack of \"authenticity\" is rather meaningless in the Madison context.

Chang's is, of course, part of an upscale  national chain, for both better and worse. Were there more exciting--and less stereotypic-- family-run options in town (as there are with Thai and Laotian food), I would likely prefer them. And the larger local operations--notably including local favorite Imperial Gardens--strike me as insipid. Compared to those options, Chang's does what it does pretty well--offering fairly distinctive and imaginative tastes from a variety of regional Chinese cuisines. Spicing is more interesting and assertive than the local norm, and most of the options less gloppy. There are some lively vegetarian choices--we especially like their eggplant dish. And there are several lamb choices, unusual for Madison Chinese restaurants. Ambience is upscale bistro, somwhat loud except for a seasonal outdoor patio. Service quality has varied over multiple visits, with lots of relatively inexperienced, although generally friendly, young staff.
Not for every taste or budget, but in my view the closest to a decent place for Chinese-style food in town."}
{"text":"Super inviting and awesome staff! The hosts, were absolutely incredible! I forgot ones name, but the other was Simone. Just from walking in they made the visit great. The food, drinks, and service staff were awesome too! Thanks for showing me around, hosts!"}
{"text":"We have gone here a few times. Love that it is off the strip so easier to get in and out. 
Shawn was our waiter. He was friendly, attentive and personable. We had a party of 10 and he made sure we were all happy. The good is always great. I love the crispy green beans, Changs spicy chicken, honey shrimp, beef and broccoli, and pork low mein but can't forget the won ton soup. 
Their desserts are the best! Don't pass on them. Try them all."}
{"text":"First time here and all the booths were taken.  The hostess tried to seat us right next to the kitchen door.  Since we were there with family and wanted a quieter spot she then put us in the corner.  Of course the music playing, we were right under a speaker.  This made it difficult for us to converse especially when you have someone with a health condition that makes it difficult for them to talk and talk above the noise.  During the meal we asked if they could turn the volume down and the waiter said he told the manager but we couldn't hear any difference.  
PF Changs is your basic starter Chinese restaurant.  Food was filling enough and the waiter was pleasant and prompt.  Not sure if I would come back....."}
{"text":"OK. PF Chang's is pretty good. There food is better than your average corner Chinese Takeout. However, it is a far cry from \"home wok'ed.\" It is too salty, has no \"overtones\" (subtle flavor that let's you know it uses fresh ingredients, herbs, and kitchen made sauces not dumped from a vat). Let's face it--PFC is slowly becoming a \"Chinese Appleby's.\" That said, the BIGGEST PROBLEM with their catering menu is portion. DO NOT EVER ORDER ANY OF THEIR SALADS FROM THE CATERING MENU. I wanted to splurge on supper for the family and felt a little guilty about never having time to cook :/ I ordered a tray of Almond Chicken--the flavor was OK and it was LOADED with chicken, which is a good thing! Also ordered a Lemongrass Salad and it was a joke! The \"greens\" barely covered the bottom of the aluminum tray, there was almost no chicken, and half the tray was taken up with a container of dressing. We would have gotten TONS more salad if I had ordered four separate salads. NEVER, EVER ORDER SALAD FROM THEIR CATERING MENU. Hope that helps."}
{"text":"I just picked up a lettuce wrap appetizer and sesame chicken carryout. The food is always good as far as I'm concerned so no complaints there.....however the attitude and lack of customer service and hospitality professionalism bothers me when it's poor. Tonight the carryout girl seemed very agitated with my request for extra lettuce and sauce. The rolling of the eyes and turning away in a disgusted manner are enough to cause me to take my business elsewhere. Please be mindful that without customers you do not have to worry about being courteous and respectful."}
{"text":"Yes it's a chain and serves non authentic Chinese. Yes it is pretty good. Happy hour has some pretty solid deals."}
{"text":"They have a huge gluten free menu here!!! It makes me really happy :) love love love the chicken lettuce wraps, you cannot come here without getting them!!
We came for dinner on a Sunday and called around 6:30pm to see if it was still happy hour. We were told that happy hour was until 7 but when we got there they told us there is no happy hour on sundays. The manager came out and was very apologetic so we stayed and order coconut sours while we waited for the rest of our dinner party. I love the coconut lemon sour, it's made with coconut water and I ask them to leave out the simple syrup bc I don't like it sweet.
After we got seated for dinner the service was a little slow but the food is good! The spicy chicken is good but the sauce is very rich and sweet (as our most items). The chicken lettuce wraps are a more lighter refreshing item. 
Prices are typical for this type of sit down full service restaurant. About $15 a plate. We always end up ordering way too much food here so my sister got to take home so many leftovers!"}
{"text":"Came here with my fiance after hearing some good things about P.F. Changs. The atmosphere is very enjoyable but the food was mediocre, and the sushi is a huge disappointment. To start we ordered a california roll, which is a pretty standard sushi roll in North America. It was very cold, quite obviously pre-made and refridgerated. Totally not how a restaurant of any kind should serve sushi, and why we often avoid buying sushi at grocery stores. Our entrees were the honey chicken and lo mein noodles, which took 20 to 25 minutes to arrive, only because our waitress decided to \"check up on our food\". She brought it to us right away after that, and it was luke warm, which tells me it had been sitting for a while. Half way through eating it had become cold. The waitress asked if we would like to take a look at the dessert menu, and although I said yes, she never brought it and instead just brought our bill. I don't understand how someone can ask to sell you something more, and the buyer is willing, and then the seller doesn't deliver. What kind of business is that? After this experience, I don't think we'll be looking to eat sushi in Las Vegas for a while as we can get it for cheaper back home and a lot more fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Great dinner and they have my favorite beer, Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen. Food was great atmosphere was great silver was awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered through GrubHob and our food was flavorless and bland. Most TV dinners have more flavor, in fact, the P.F Chang's own frozen meals taste better. Won't be ordering from here again, unfortunately. Hopefully something changes because their food has steadily been going downhill for awhile."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a while but since my boyfriend's bday & he wanted to go there so we decided to go.  Josh-our server was very good!  He was very professional & come check on us often if we need anything.  I just singed up this reward thing right before come over & we got free desert already!  Super!!    Food was awesome, service was excellent,  we got very good bday dinner.  I think we'll go there more often now."}
{"text":"Used to enjoy getting take out here regularly. Our last three orders have all had problems - 2 orders had food that was burned and inedible, and 1 order was missing 2 items and was 30 minutes late in being prepared.

Also, on two of those orders, they had no white rice OR brown rice available to go with our dishes... how can PF Changs not have rice?!?"}
{"text":"Worst experience. Food was good. I wont complain. Today was my wives bday and i have made my reservations and ordered a birthday desert for her. They forgot to bring the cake and when I complained they didn't have the courtesy to respond properly and just ignored me. I never expected such a behaviour from one of the senior staff."}
{"text":"The 'P' stands for 'poor' yes?
A generally very well run chain, this one is to be avoided - seems to be ran by 9 year olds who are long on appologies, short on resolution. Don't bother making a reservation, they don't honor the system. The food is ok, but the experience? There are SO many better places in Tempe. Give this one a miss."}
{"text":"I love the food and services . I forgot her name but she was great server .
     The location is awesome. Restaurant is great to go ..."}
{"text":"While the food was excellent, the service could have been better. We went for my birthday and my husband had told them that when he made the reservation, but clearly they didn't tell the waiter. The Mai Tai wasn't just a little strong like the waiter said, it was pure alcohol with a splash of juice. They should make it bigger with same amount of alcohol and more juice. I couldn't even finish it. 
He checked my ID and still didn't notice it was my birthday. Then when he asked if we had plans for the evening, I told him we were celebrating my birthday so I get a 'happy birthday'. Then instead of holding our desert and putting the candle on that, we got the desert and he brought a plate with a candle five minutes later. Not the birthday experience we wanted, especially when we spent $60 on the meal. More effort would have been appreciated and we won't go back for another celebration. Since its a 30 min drive, there are other Asian food places that are just as good closer to our house."}
{"text":"The food is good nothing out of this world, but good and filling.  They do say that the entrees are family size but honestly I could eat one whole dish myself, but maybe that's just me.  I had the Mongolian beef and the king pao chicken.  Both were good but I would have liked the king pao a bit more spicier.  Entree dishes cone with choice if white or brown rice.  Other people in group had some sushi and they loved it so much they ordered a sack d helping.
Now what sets this place apart is that they accommodated our big group of about 9 people in a private room.  Also our server Lee was beyond awesome.  Kept checking on us, refilling our waters and had a great sense of humor.  He made the night for sure."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is so fricken awesome! I've yet to have an entree...  We always share the northern style spare ribs and chicken lettuce wraps. Wash it down with some awesome brew. I go to this place any chance I can. You need reservations at night for sure.  All their dishes look and smell great. Heck, if I can't get a table, I just get it to go and take it home. Try it..."}
{"text":"The food was terrible. It was reduced down to the point where it tasted concentrated and salty. This my 2nd trip and same result both times 180.00 later,leftovers in the fridge."}
{"text":"Fantastic waitresses. Excellent food. Very clean, and we had a great time! Kids menu hits the spot for my fussiest eater. Pad Thai was amazing. Sweet and sour sauce was great. Took home tons of awesome leftovers home. Amazing food for a great price! Our waitress gave us tips on how to use the chopsticks. The fruit on the kids plates was fresh and served beautifully. The hostess greeted us with a smile and welcomed us in."}
{"text":"Curb  side service is a winner !!! Fast fresh and hot comes your food!!! Always on time and they remember to put your food in the order"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Place was clean but service not so much...they forget your food but dont neglect to charge you...knowingly"}
{"text":"Usually PF Changs is a place with great service and food, this location lacked both. I came here with my family of seven on vacation in Las Vegas. We came around noon and at time, it wasn't busy.

First off, our server lacked the intelligence to take our order. I wasn't sure if she didn't understand what we wanted to order or if she wanted us to buy the more expensive dishes in order to get a bigger tip. Either eat, it didn't seem like she cared of providing good service.

The food was god awful. Everything was dry and had little to no flavor. The rice that came with the dishes were extremely dry. If I were blindfolded and eating their rice and bits of paper, I wouldn't have known the difference. We ordered the salmon and asked it to be cooked well. It came out with the inside still pink/slightly cooked. 

Overall, everything was poor. I enjoyed the restaurants decor. That's a plus."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and the service was very good. The northern ribs are great and  you should try the lettuce wraps... Now I am hungry again"}
{"text":"This is better then average Chinese food prepared for an American palate. Most everything is good. But, it's all a bit too salty. So I get everything with the sauces on the side. We usually order the Ahi Tuna Wasabi salad. If you want to stay in the suburbs and same some decent Chinese, this is a good option."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped here for the first time and really enjoyed our meal. We shared orange peel chicken and Korean BBQ chicken which was our favorite.  Both were excellent. We will defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Came for date night on a Monday night, seemed pretty slow which is fine for us, we don't like lively or loud restaurants. We were seated in a booth, which is also perfect! Our server Jennifer was so attentive and kind. We started with 2 spring rolls, then the calamari and vegetables. As she was serving entrees to another table she stopped to show us what one of the plates looked like. I ordered the stir fried eggplant and substituted in some fried tofu (SO YUMMY) and my fiancé got the ginger chicken with broccoli with a lil extra spice (ALSO GOOD). The calamari was so good and filling and we had some time in between the entree but it just made our food taste so much better. For our first time being to this restaurant we are sure to come back with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing adventure


In excitement to go to PF CHANGS, I made a reservation. In obvious disappointment sat for 20 mins with no waiter, food was cold to touch and waitress was sarcastically helpful. Very overcrowded with left over napkins from previous guest under the table. 

Manager timidly walks over to the table and tries her best to diffuse my irritation, only to have the waitress come back and ask \"you good\"?"}
{"text":"So I was in a hurry and grabbed the Dynamite Shrimp appetizer to go.  It was a no-go.
Got home and was a soggy, mushy mess.  No crispy outside.  Blah.  My bad...eat asap in restaurant!  The food here is good....just be smart about take-out!"}
{"text":"It's the only good classy place to eat  at Planet Hollywood/Miracle mile. Quality food, freshly prepared, tasty and satisfying. My regular order is Kung Pao shrimp and garlic string beans. However I have found over several trips both these dishes to be too salty (abundant use of soy sauce) so i am not pleased about that. Otherwise this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing as always!! Discovered they have a secret sauce \"the ring of fire\" I will never eat here again with out it!!! Dali chicken is back and I am so excited, tried the new lobster and shrimp fried rice and It was so delicious with the red Fresno chili's in it!! Our server Julie was on point and so nice, my husband and I met at PF Changs over 10 years ago when we worked as servers and always come back for special occasions and are always excited to try the new menu items"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to PF Changs for lunch today, and I was extremely disappointed to say the least. My wife is allergic to eggs and asked for fried rice without egg, we were told it is all pre-made and the kitchen is too busy to make our fried rice without egg, there was maybe 10 people in the restaurant, even fast food restaurants make make food to order. Our server was also a little rude about it like we should have known they don't make food to order. I was a little angry about his so I asked him what they did for people who had allergies that wanted fried rice, emphatically he said, \"we have a separate menu so they know what they can order.\" He did come back a few minutes later and say the kitchen would prepare our rice the way we requested it. 

After our food came, the table next to us got up and left. Their server came over and was cleaning their table and sweeping the floor. The manager was in the background staring at her ass. It was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. On the plus side, their food was really good."}
{"text":"Awesome kung pao chicken!!!!  The dynamite shrimp werent as spicy as i had hoped, but still good!  everything served family style, so order to share!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location; I usually go to the one in Summerlin. I brought a friend who had never tried PF Changs before, and she really liked it.

Their lettuce wraps are amazing, a definite must! The Broccoli & Beef and Sesame Chicken were fantastic as well. The staff was very friendly and helpful, explained and suggested a few things on the menu. 
I would definitely recommend this location for a good quality meal."}
{"text":"The customer service was great here. BUT the food could have been better.  I've been to a lot of pf chang locations and the food here was really over cooked!"}
{"text":"Happy Mother's Day. Thank you To our server, Allyssa for making our Mother's Day fan-tas-tic. Pork street tacos almost as amazing as the Mohito's. And great service to top it off. PF Changs for all occasions!!!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying it was a Very nice Fathers Day yesterday, And Thank you PF Changs of Tempe. And it wouldnt have been possible if it wasnt for our Bartender, Server Jackie fresh in from Buffalo, NY. Our original reservation were in the dinning room, but since we got there early we went to the bar for a couple of pre-dinner cocktails. And thats where we meet Jackie. And what a friendly employee you have there . So with temps outside at 120 degrees, but delicious filets, to the spicy Tuna rolls, and Brown rice, and lets not forget our very Cold Kirins in then keepsake glasses,  ive said to much. Dinner was Great. Thanks Greg Olea"}
{"text":"Eating at out \"go to\" place. After today's horrible service will be looking for new place

It is not busy. No introduction. Waiter passed by 3 time not stopping to see how it's going. Not to mention need more lettuce for our now cold lettuce wrap."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a P.F. Chang's and it was an amazing experience. Our server Mike and the manager Molly treated me and my family like royalty. The food wash delicious and the service was phenomenal. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"this place is awesome and very fancy at a very reasonae price !! I got the sweet and sour chicken and it was awesomely delicious !!! we also got some sushi and that was very great tasting as well !!.. server was also very on it !!.. she was great and has a smile all the time ! the desert was amazing as well !!! oh my lordie !!! I LOVED the coconut pecan fruity vanilla ice cream they served with the banana fritters !!! ahhh !!! delicious !!!!"}
{"text":"While the entree was very tasty, it seemed a very small amount of it for that much money.   I had the Shaking Beef, and some of the beef seemed kind of fatty.  But overall, the product was very good and was something you couldn't get at a standard Chinese restaurant.   It came with brown rice, which was either undercooked or old since it was so crunchy to eat.  I eventually just ate the entree without rice.   I also had hot and sour soup which was good, but it seemed a bit thick like it had been in the pot for a very long time.   Finally I had the Sweet Vanilla Cream Wontons.  Two very tiny wontons for $3.50?   I will not be getting those again.   All in all, not bad food, just not worth the $25 they charge for it."}
{"text":"on 2/25 we hosted a 21st bday weekend for 16....the restaurant chosen for the bday dinner was P.F.Changs @ Planet Hollywood Hotel.  Everything was pre-arranged with Darnella, the manager. Private room was already booked so we were to be seated in main dining area. The table they set up was upstairs facing the \"strip\"; absolutely beautiful view. Our waiter, David, was fantastic; so attentive....  The food was good; as I expected.  I truly felt that our service was as if we were in a 5 star restaurant.  So impressed.  they brought out a huge; bday dessert (delicious choc cake) at the end of our meal to celebrate the special bday. I reluctantly chose P..F. Changs after the other asian fusion restaurant I selected had some issues.  I didn't want a \"chain\" restaurant, but I was running out of time to book.
I would highly recommend anyone planning a large dinner party in Vegas; not overlook  this P.F. Chang's for the reasons I almost had.  I pre-ordered the food; which was a better value."}
{"text":"I had just flown in that night and finally got to my hotel around 8:30, I quickly called the first restaurant I saw to order dinner take out (this pf changs). When I get there, the hostess is no where to be found and there's two other parties waiting to be served or seated.

Once she finally gets there, she asks if anyone was here to order or pick up take out- I say yes, and then she directs me to a back counter near the bathrooms to the take out pick up counter... there is again, no one there to help. 

Another employee sees me standing there and comes over to say that I have to pick up take out at the bar.. I tell them that I was told to come here so she says \"Oh really? That's weird.. let me check on that.\" 

Mind you, they still have not asked me about my order or my name. The front desk hostess comes over and says \"Sorry we're trying to find our manager to help you.\" I don't really understand why the manager has to check me out, but okay, I'll wait.

About 10 minutes go by and then they come back since they figured out that the hostess can process the order and I am on my way to eat my average chicken lettuce wraps. 

I work in technology support so maybe I am critical, but this service was sub-par."}
{"text":"They offer a good selection of Vegan dishes which was a nice change from other selections close to our convention venue"}
{"text":"Really awesome food and amazing customer service. I really enjoyed my experience here if I am back in the area I will be certain to come back to this location."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming to this location! The employees are friendly and the place is always clean. 
Went in last for dinner and to my surprise the place wasn't busy at all. (I've always gone on the weekends) our food came out very quick. 

Spicy chicken noodle soup: BEST SOUP EVER!! (Chicken, mushrooms, noodles, cherry tomatoes)
Egg rolls: were a bit on the greasy side, but they are huge
Combo lo mein: was okay 
Asian grilled salmon: full of flavor, super good!
Shrimp with lobster sauce: fave plate on the menu!
Banana spring rolls: (dessert) To die for!!!! The ice cream is creamy and delicious!"}
{"text":"We had a very late dinner here on Saturday night and there were a ton of people waiting to be seated when we arrived. We were a party of three so we figured the wait wouldn't be too bad. 

We walked in and headed straight towards the hostesses to check in. One of the hostesses, (male) just gave us a weird look and went on to do what he was doing. We stood there and just looked at him. He didn't greet us or not even a \"we will be right with you.\" 

Out of the corner the other hostess, (female) quickly ran over and helped us out. I gave her my number and she said the wait would be about 20 to 30 minutes. We headed outside to wait. 

Waiting wasn't bad, and they txted us when our table was ready. Our server came over right away and she dropped off menus. The dining area was very busy so it was a tad bit loud inside. Our table was very STICKY so we did ask our server for a rag to wipe it down. She came on over and she quickly wiped it down for us. 

We ended up ordering a spicy chicken noodle soup, one order of the chili garlic green beans, and the kung pao chicken. 

The chicken noodle soup is the BEST!!!! If you haven't tried it, please do. Our kung pao chicken was very flavorful and the green beans were great! The food was delicious! 

The waitress was friendly and she did a great job with refilling our drinks. The inside is a bit too dark for my liking. Ive been to a bunch of other locations and this location seems to be the darkest one inside. 

I will be back when in the area! Oh and do sign up for their rewards program!"}
{"text":"PF Changs used to be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  I could literally eat there any day of the week.  My last three experiences have disappointed me.  I order take out just as much as I dine in and it is usually never disappoints.  Not the case the last two times I've ordered take out.  I hate giving such a low score.  I just want to see PF Changs go back to how it used to be.  Delicious!
I ordered crispy green beans and received a regular order of spicy green bean instead. We love the Crispy Green Beans, so that was disappointing.  The Changs Spicy chicken had a piece of shrimp in it.  Thankfully Im not allergic, but I don't eat seafood.  The chicken quality seems poor.  Extremely thin cuts where its mostly breading.  Our Kung Pao chicken was burnt and extremely dry, we didn't even take a second bite.  The Beef a la Sichuan was thick cuts of beef instead of the thin sliced.  The side of Sichuan asparagus had no flavor.  Lastly, I always order the Garlic Noodles that used to be on the menu and the last three times, I've had to add a sauce from my own refrigerator.  They basically were just cooked noodles with cilantro on top.  

Next time I have a craving, ill think twice about ordering.  Makes me sad because I really do love that place."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the hoopla about P F Changs. I first visited the location in La Jolla, CA as my business was across the street. I remember how unremarkable they were. I had a hellacious experience there and never set foot in a PFC since .... Until yesterday at Happy Valley.

It is amazing how things haven't changed - still mediocre food and stupid high prices. A least they keep the dining room so dimly lit you can't see the food they serve.  I can't recommend them unless you prefer to have a few cocktails before dinner is served. At least your taste buds will be numb. 

I've had the best elsewhere ...... Save yourself a lot of money and go to the little express fast food joint with the bear - its a whole lot better for the price paid and the quality received then use the money you saved and go to the movies."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. It was hot out but say outside. Had great service, food and drinks. My wife thought she would want me to make her the coconut mojito she had. Our waiter printed the recipe for us. He was very nice and although we were the only people outside he was right there when we wanted him. The spicy wontons are really good. 
We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best service experiences that we have received in awhile and the food was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Haven't been back here in years, but the food is still great quality. First off, join the eclub and you automatically get a free order of lettuce wraps. Great dish with marinated white chicken and rice sticks and an array of sauces. Saved 8 bucks on that order. We ate at the bar on New Years day and luckily the lunch specials stretch out to 4pm every day. One order was shrimp potstickers with whole pieces of shrimp inside. They don't let you order the Dim sum special pan-fried, so steamed is your only choice. Crispier is always better. My dish was Ginger chicken with broccoli, but this was chang's upscale style and I found cherry tomatoes and red onions along with a subtle ginger, garlic sauce. The fried rice on the side was a buck extra and probably not worth it, but the hot and sour soup was one of the better versions i have had over the years. Brittany at the bar was very nice and helpful as the bar got crowded close to her shift end and she even made sure to figure out what was the delay in our mains without me having to ask. Things got resolved and this was a great lunch to start the new year."}
{"text":"We were stuck in the Mesa area getting repairs on the RV , we had 9 days on our hands and no way to cook for ourselves. We tried all the restaurants in the area of  Superstition & Power. This was by FAR and AWAY the best. We ended up eating there 5 times , every time we tried something new and every dish we tried was amazing. The banana spring rolls were great ! The veggies were fresh and well cooked. The staff was very friendly and the overall ambiance of the restaurant was very pleasing , I just wish we had one of these restaurants nearer our house !"}
{"text":"Yes this is a chain. But I really like it nonetheless. What can I say? It's super tasty! It's also a good place to grab dinner at 10:30pm on a Saturday when nowhere else is still open...although I would've wanted to go here anyways. The Lettuce wraps are amazingly good, especially with the yummy sauce they mix up for you at your table. We also ordered the Honey Chicken and the Mongolian Beef, which were both very good too. I like the atmosphere of this location as well, and the server was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Asian food. It's an upscale Asian restaurant, right in the middle of the strip. It's moderately priced at around $20 an entree. There are very few asian(Chinese) restaurants on the strip and so, this is my default go to when I am in Vegas. 

Ordered the black pepper chicken. Wasn't too happy with it, the chicken was dry and the flavor just wasn't there. I provided the feedback to the manager Robert and he was kind enough to replace it with Chang's Spicy Chicken. The great service and amazing food is what makes me keep coming back to P.F. Chang's!"}
{"text":"Was treated to dinner by a friend who wholeheartedly recommended the Chilean seabass. Surprised to see that it was available, I decided to have it. This entree came in a bed of sauteed spinach and a side of rice for $26. The service, presentation and entree were excellent. However, I later searched the Internet for Chilean sea bass and learned that it is not only an endangered fish but contains such a high level of mercury that pregnant women are at risk to eat it. Just saying ... not a cool thing to serve the unknowing public."}
{"text":"Seared Ahi Tuna on a bed of tossed spinach was fantastic and the service was tops."}
{"text":"The dining room is very open here, and the decor is nice. Strategic placing of mirrors at the end creates the illusion of greater space, while not looking old fashioned at all. The playing of modern hipster tunes helps the customer experience.

As their website states, \"P.F. Chang's features a blend of high-quality, Asian-inspired cuisine and American hospitality in a sophisticated, contemporary setting.\" I can definitely attest to this, and submitted several photos to the Yelp page for this location on Yelp as proof of that.

We came here and ordered the lettuce wraps to start. The be clear, I wasn't a fan, they used iceberg lettuce which is terrible for wrapping. Take a page out of other Asian fusion restaurants that tend to use Boston lettuce. It is higher quality and bought in bulk is great for restaurant B2B purchasing discounts.

Next came the egg drop soups as part of the four course prix fixe meal. We ordered the lo mein with chicken, kung pao shrimp and the banana egg roll deserts. The egg drop soup was good as ever, they add thin carrot slices to add color without being too sweet and overpowering. The chicken lo mein was good, had the smoky flavor expected from high temps on a wok in the kitchen, and the banana egg rolls were great, served with a delicate scoop of ice cream and caramel drizzle.

Would return, I just wish PF Chang's as a whole would invest in better lettuce for their wraps. Why take a delicious meat mix and then ruin it with cheap lettuce? Doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"ATTN ANDREA: I'm super super sorry, I was short on cash that day and only tipped you 18% when I really wanted to tip you much more! If we have you as a server next time, I'll make up the difference to you!

Really impressed with the level of service at this particular PF Changs. Andrea was our server and ensured that our party had everything that we needed. I ordered two drinks, the first was the coconut mojito which had the right balance of coconut milk with the traditional expectations of what a mojito should have (mint, lime, rum, soda). Second drink I got was the mai tai; really strong and really reminiscent of an Arnold Palmer!

For entrees, my party ordered the vegetable egg (spring?) rolls, the ginger chicken with broccoli, chili-garlic green beans and the salt/pepper prawns. All of these dishes were excellent! I will attach photos to my review shortly after posting.

Ambiance wise, this PF Chang's has the bar directly viewable as soon as you enter, with dining tables situated around the bar. Plenty of tables, yet this place gets so packed so quickly with how popular PF Chang's can be!

Service wise, my server Andrea was great, came by at the right moments and offered suggestions when asked, but more importantly, the entire front of staff was incredibly attentive. Simple gestures like staff opening the front door for guests resonates in customers' minds when they think \"PF Chang's\".

Would return and already have :)"}
{"text":"Save some money and just get regular Chinese food from your local place. It will taste much better. They even missed the mark on the egg rolls. 

Overpriced, Does not live up to the hype. They use the term \"fusion\" to explain the odd flavors that just do not jive. Looks much better than it tastes. Lousy seating situation. The door is centered in the room, so every time it opened a gust of cold wind filled the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"For some ungodly reason, my father decided this is where he wanted to eat on his birthday. We sat and we ordered. We waited. And waited. And waited. 
Our server, Kyle really did everything he possibly could have to try to expedite our food. But there were only 2 servers for the entire restaurant on a Saturday! He was drowning in tables. Shame on the management for not calling another server in. They had plenty of time, as we waited 30 minutes just to receive our appetizer. Once the food FINALLY arrived, it was decent, but nothing to write home about. The only saving grace for this experience was our server, Kyle. He was calm, cool, and collected under pressure, and P.F. Chang's owes him a debt of gratitude for his professionalism."}
{"text":"I was recently talking to someone about how there is no good Chinese food in Madison.  I love chinese food but rarely eat it anymore.  Oddly, a few weeks later I ended up at PF Changs on a spur of the moment.  We were seated promptly then completely forgotten--no one came by to take a drink order or even give us water.  It was bad.  I alerted the host and there were profuse apologies.  The waitstaff and managers fawned over us the rest of the meal.  We were comped about $40 worth of food too.  They more than made up for the mistake and the food was fantastic"}
{"text":"First time at this location. Service was exceptional. Our waiter went out if his way to make the experience worth the trip. Food, yummy as always. However, must note that since learning of my gluten allergy, PF Changs has become a comforting and Appetizing place to go. They provide an entire gluten free menu and cook in a separate kitchen. They take food allergies serious.  For those with this concern, put PF  Changs on your must eat at list."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. First time I had the whole family together in many months. Service was slow, located our own share plates and left hungry.  We had ordered additional food at 6pm and were told at 6:30 that they had issues in the kitchen and could not get our order out anytime soon . At that point we left disappointed and hungry. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Sunday, March 6th, 2016 I visited this location. The hostess seated me and my friend in a booth designed for 4 or more people.  There were many tables open as the place was not busy.  I am a large guy at 265 pounds.  Anyone could see this was not a comfortable seat for me.  The hostess seemed to care less.  Not offering a table. I think this was very rude.
The waiter:  Well the waiter was mediocre, asking me if I wanted protein in my rice.  WTF, protein.  What was he going to do to my rice?  One can only imagine.  lol
The decor of the place is awesome!  I love the atmosphere, but lets train the employees a little better."}
{"text":"My favorite chain restaurant. Love their gluten free menu. At this particular location the staff was friendly, fun and knowledgable. I had the shaking beef no dressing and they put the sauce on the side. It was great. Kids had the honey chicken and ate it all so I guess they liked theirs. Best part dessert! Flourless dome:)"}
{"text":"Another good experience here.it is our pre-anniversary date night dinner and we enjoyed it.the lady who was serving us was friendly. We ordered almost same food we order every time when we are here.in total a good romantic food night for us..;)"}
{"text":"Great spot for work lunches. Their lunch menu is really good. The Thai bowls are really tasty."}
{"text":"I like to grab the wonton soup and some chicken lettuce wraps to go.  Always neatly packaged to-go food which is always hot when I reach my house.  Love the friendly service."}
{"text":"I usually get take-out and they always do a great job packaging and correctly preparing the order.  Lettuce wraps are a must 5/5 and the Wonton soup is another option I would recommend.  Friendly and consistent.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I've had better chinese food from takeout. It tastes like typical chain food loaded with pre-made ingredients, sugar and salt. Nothing special considering what you pay."}
{"text":"Great Dinner! Sangria is so refreshing...Love it ...Our Waitress even printed out the drink recipe Great waitress.Love this place...sushi is fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"This place is a good, quick restaurant with nice decor. The one major thing I like about PF Chang's is that they ask about allergies. I, personally, have a food allergy and appreciate that they inquire about such. That little detail sets them apart."}
{"text":"Great manager who has a killer singing voice and saved our date night. Food was slow but probably not a review of the restaurant as a whole."}
{"text":"The food was good. The waitress was nice. A little slow.  I probably wouldn't put it at the top of my list but it was convenient to where we were shopping. The Ginger Chicken and crispy green beans were good. Portion servings were good and we even had left overs."}
{"text":"Don't go to this location.!!! It took 50 mins to get our food. Imagine going with two kids and waiting that long. When we asked our waiter why is it taking so long, he replies sorry I'll check on it, comes back 15 mins later and says its on its way and disappears. He had someone else bring ur out after waiting over an hour !!! Never bling back to any of changs since this location screwed up !'"}
{"text":"I love pf changs. Im a big chinese food fan! My husband I love the lemon pepper shrimp! I usually tell my husband to order it with extra veggies. I also love there banana spring rolls with coconut icecream! Its amazing!!! What a great place to eat. I will never get sick of it."}
{"text":"okay, so Im no stranger to P.F Changs in Emeryville, CA (WHICH I F**CKING LOVE)but however every P.F.is not the same.  

The containers here are even different (my food seeped out and spilled everywhere on my garments)..

The food was okay, not the best, but I do have to consider that every chef is different even though the menu's are fairly the same.

The guy waiters were cool, but the women waiters portrayed that they are real catty. (i vicariously, listened to another customer experience, who was having a hard time, because she just gave birth and felt self-concisous of her weight, and the waitress wome were all over her husband like flies on shit. it was disgusting, women shouldn't act thirsty, especially at work.

I WILL NOT RETURN!"}
{"text":"- generic main dishes 
-dry rice white and brown
-great service , very friendly
-small portions when it comes to food
fun fact- the kung pow shrimp is breaded so if  you think you are trying to be healthy ordering the shrimp think again at P.F. Changs"}
{"text":"I know this place does Americanized Chinese, but I thought the flavors were pretty bland relative to what they should have been, and it was way overpriced for how it tasted."}
{"text":"I wanted to write a quick review because we had a very pleasant experience for a family lunch of about fourteen people the waiter was very accommodating and courteous considering we had to vegans in the group and the service was fairly fast."}
{"text":"We had another opportunity to eat here today and the experience was much improved. There was no crowd to fight and we weren't seated near the door as we were last time. As I expected, getting a table near the edge of the restaurant provides for a much nicer dining experience. Our service was good and they accommodated our 1 year old nicely. I appreciate that they serve steamed veggies on the kids menu. 

I still left with the impression that the serving sizes were small in comparison to most other places, but we were satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Our server was fantastic. He took his time with everything he did. We have not been to a PF Changs in many years. This is simply because we don't have one near us. When we ate here, it was as if we have been here many times before. The food did not change at all. As a matter Of fact, it made us want more. Many thanks to this PF Changs for being very clean, friendly with fabulous food."}
{"text":"Holy SALT!! Lay off on the soy sauce and salt In the street noodles! My goodness! Barely edible! Won't be going back. I assume a few people have made this decision as well as the restaurant was dead at 1230 when I went in to pick up my food.... unfortunate, used to live this place!"}
{"text":"Usually when I travel on business I choose to seat at the bar to have dinner. It is less awkward than occupying a table by myself. I've had great service here at the bar, the staff knows their drinks and have always been on point when recommending vegetarian options from the menu. 
Not sure if it is the fact that Phoenix is not as expensive as my other business stops around the country, I found the prices I've paid here very reasonable for the amount of food and drinks consumed.
Plenty of vegetarian options, wonderfully creative drinks, attentive staff and reasonable prices. What's not to like.
Whenever you find yourself in Phoenix, whether on business or otherwise, stop here to nourish yourself. You will not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Disaster! We were three.  We had a 5:45 reservation but we were seated at 5:40.  This was all good because we had tickets to a show and we wanted to have a nice leisurely dinner.  Within 5 minutes of being seated, we ordered our meals.  Within 5 minutes of ordering, we had our ice tea.  So, now we're still foodless at 30 minutes past ordering our food.  Now it's 40 minutes, no food.  What's up, we ask our server. We have a private party in the private room and their order went in before ours.  But your order should be out in 5 minutes.  After 10 more minutes, still no food, we got up and left and got a less leisurely meal elsewhere prior to our show.  If the restaurant had a private party coming in on a Saturday night when the place is crowded and people waiting to be seated, they should bring in additional cooks, kitchen staff, and a waiter or two.  And to make matters worse, I couldn't take advantage of my P.F. Chang's gift card."}
{"text":"They give you such a tiny portion and I got the sweet n sour chicken as lunch and I was still hungry plus my rice was cold would I come Back maybe not"}
{"text":"As far as gluten free Asian eats go, this is the place to go!  They have GF eats, drinks, and a GF flourless chocolate cake that is amazing.  

The Tempe location seemed a bit smaller than the other locations but they have a huge patio.  The staff was very friendly which is consistent with all of the other chains.  

Only downer was the table was extremely sticky like it had not be wiped, but after watching a waitress wipe a table it became apparent why the tables were sticky.  LOL.  they only used a Lysol to clean the table.  LOL smh"}
{"text":"Considering that this is a chain which can earn a bad name, I really enjoy dining here! The interior atmosphere is really fun and has a very \"zen\" vibe. The food is delicious Chinese cuisine! 

The main courses are designed as family style, so it may be a fun way to try several different options! I opted for the Ahi Poke bowl and it did not disappoint. There was more poke than I could eat and the wonton chips were some of the best I've ever had. I also sampled my friends honey chicken which was crispy and delicious. Both came with big servings of rice. 

For dessert, we opted for the new mini desserts which were also delicious and a great way to satisfy your sweet craving when you're full!

Be careful, this place gets busy! It was a Saturday night around 730 and we still had about a 20 minute wait. Service was also a little slow, but I still enjoyed the experience!"}
{"text":"What has happened to this one time great place to eat? It has sincerely gone straight to hell.  The food makes Panda Express look like a 5 star restaurant. How can you in good conscience send out food like we had to your customers? Service is sub-par at best. Management is poor,and does not take complaints seriously. This was a disappointing experience,to say the least."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant expecting a typical PF Chang experience and we were pleasantly surprised with something extraordinary! The service was exceptional, our server AJ went above and beyond to make our family feel special and as comfortable as possible. I would come back for the service alone AJ is amazing at his job, thank you for a delightful dining experience!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good....however,  the service is NOT.  Last time I was here, I waited nearly 15 minutes until I finally flagged down a waiter.  It wasn't his station but he was kind enough to take up my order on a busy friday night. When I was leaving, I had asked for the manager. He came out, shook my hand, introduced himself, and I complimented him on his employee. He asked me if I lived in the summerlin area, I told him no, I drove 20 miles to get here. He said to me very smuggly \"oh.. well have a good night.\" I'm here again on a saturday afternoon, the place is half empty, and the service is just as bad.  I guess the treatment  is because  \"i don't live in Summerlin \"  Funny, my money looks the same as the people in Summerlin."}
{"text":"We use to have lunch here regularly. Sadly it has gone down hill. Sad to say the flavor of the food is just not as good as it use to be. Miss the lemon chicken. The gluten free beef & broccoli taste strange."}
{"text":"I just ordered the beef and broccoli along with the fried dumplings.. Can you say way over priced.. I dropped $25 on food that was not all that good.. The beef and broccoli was so sweet.. Toward the end I had to stop eating it because it was sickly sweet and felt the same about the dumplings sauce.. (Just as a rule of thumb... Don't put the sauce all over the dumplings on a take out order.. They became soggy) but why so much sugar!? I think you should scale way back, probably by 3/4ths. 
Totally not worth the cost of the food.. The only bright spot was the customer service, it was excellent.."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick take out order. The customer service was cery good. I was helped immediately upon entering the restaurant. 

The only downside to eating here, the parking! Ughh what a pain!!"}
{"text":"Came with a group of 7, and had a fantastic server that got our orders right, and got them out to us very fast! 

Love the honey glazed chicken."}
{"text":"Food good service substandard at best. If u have lots of time to waste it will ok i guess"}
{"text":"Chicken noodle soup brought me back to life after a loooong night of partying. Only downer is it is way far off the Strip & no easy cab access. You have to go across the street to Terrible's casino and they call a cab for you, which takes 10-15 mins to get there"}
{"text":"I have dined here many times but yesterday was different. We had the most pleasant server, Jared!  I am pregnant and did not like my dish at all! Jared was helpful and didn't question it and got me exactly what I wished I ordered from the beginning. I will always be requesting Jared as our server!"}
{"text":"Today was my Birthday. My Sister and Husband took me to Changs. Ive eaten at the chain in California and it was OK.  This Store Really impressed me.. Had the Shrimp in Lobster sauce and the Chicken wraps. Both were great but it was the Service that really put it over the top. Our Server , Stephanie , was attentive and worked hard at making us happy. I definitely will go again soon."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite chain restaurants, and this location doesn't disappoint! 

For starters, my crew and I all had tad bit more to drink than we anticipated and we were in dire need of nourishment! We only had 30 mins until they closed so we called and were told if we were there in 5 mins then we would be seated. Obviously we obliged and to make it easier on our server and the kitchen, we ordered everything in one take! We ate family style and the food of course was delicious as always! 

Our server David was amazing! We alerted him that we had a peanut allergy and he made sure to alert the kitchen of that as well as making sure nothing we ordered, other than the pad Thai, had peanuts. He knew the bar and shots pretty well and engaged in entertaining us in conversation. We mentioned when we sat that we were celebrating a birthday and wanted banana spring rolls for the table. He brought them out with a candle and a song! Even with it being closing time his customer service didn't reflect that it was. I mean, we all know those people who come in right before closing time, and although we were those people... We didn't want to be those people. Lol."}
{"text":"This is a huge chain restaurant, so there's not much I can say that would be different from all the others. 

I will say that this is my favorite of he venues in Vegas. It's located on the strip with two stories and is open the latest! 

Oh yeah, and order the Mongolian beef and banana spring rolls!!!! Best dishes they have!"}
{"text":"My first experience at P.F. Chang's and I'm giving it five stars! 

Above all our server was spectacular. I visited with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday and he made sure we enjoyed every bit of our night. I also have a food allergy and learned they have a special menu to help me determine what I can and cannot order. Our server was very knowledgeable on each dish and made suggestions based on our preferences. 

Second the dishes are large enough to have a family style meal. I love this because being my first time I never tried anything and it all sounded so good. We started with the chicken lettuce wraps and pork potstickers. Both were fantastic! The sauces provide so much flavor. I could have eaten an entire dinner just of the lettuce wraps. 

For our dinner we ordered the Chang's chicken, Mongolian beef, and lo mein with chicken. We had two sides of rice. I usually do not order beef but I am so glad we did. It ended up being my favorite dish! 

While we did not drink or order dessert here both options looked fabulous. I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this experience at all. The lettuce wraps were great but that's about all that was positive. The chicken and broccoli was ehh and my husbands order of chang's spicy chicken was really sweet. The most underwhelming part was the incredibly small portion of rice they give you!"}
{"text":"For a quick fix it is a great place right across the street from my home. Stuff very nice and friendly, the food is good for the price. I really love their spicy chicken noodle soup. My 8 years old loves it!"}
{"text":"Not much to say, standard PFC food, pretty good, atmosphere might be a bit nicer than average, service was just ok on our visit."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese cuisine in Vegas, service is awesome and the prices are not abnormal of a fine Asian restaurant. Lettuce wraps are next level, and the Mongolian beef is out of this world. Also check out the egg drop! Great drinks too!"}
{"text":"I've been to PF Chang's in the past and have never had any complaints until now. This particular night I ordered the \"spicy chicken\" as part of their \"two meals for $39\" deal which turned out to be NOT at all spicy. The rest of the meal along with dessert was very good. The service of the waiter and friendliness of the host was impeccable!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We hear every month with my girlfriend for happy hour and fun. Definitely recommend, excellent service."}
{"text":"Always try to go to PF Changs when I am on vacation and this one is my favorite. Great atmosphere, great service and great food. 
Only bad thing is that waiting area is located right where the servers come out with food and drinks, constantly have to watch not to hit them in the crammed small area right when you walk in."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's is such a great place and we really enjoy the food.  It's a great date night and more, we have perfected our meal that we truly enjoy and explore with a few other dishes that they come out with here and there. The egg drop soup, may as well get the large bowl because it's a great value and you can always take it home, add some crunchy crispy egg noodles and it's perfect.  We get the combo lo mein for our main dish which has chicken, beef and shrimp!  We also enjoy the crispy green beans with the spicy dipping sauce, sometimes we'll go for the full instead of half order.  The staff is always great and really like that they pack up your leftovers for you, if you have any.  Top it off with their desert banana spring rolls: crispy bites of banana, caramel-vanilla drizzle, coconut-pineapple ice cream, So Good!"}
{"text":"I have eaten many times at PF Changs in other cities and had excellent food and service. Maybe it was an off-day on the food, it was around 3:00 and not very many customers in the restaurant, so would have thought service would have been better, Not! Love the lettuce wraps, so ordered them, and was disappointed with the presentation, which at other PF Changs they mix your sauce to your taste at the table, this one just gave us a small plastic bowl with a sauce, but was not like what I have had before. We asked for brown rice, got white! The main food was cold and very small, course it was lunch plates. But the chicken was mostly soggy breading, and could not find chicken in it. But worst was when I went to the restroom and it was filthy with hair on the floor and very dirty at the sink! Out of paper towels to dry your hands."}
{"text":"Busy Location. Approximately 45min to an hour wait.

Service varies on how busy the staff is but usually they are on top of it.
Great selections of food. All family size I would order one dish and it would feed about 2-3 of us. Prices are affordable.

Thing that sucks is that the place is way to crowded and you can't even wait at the bar cause there is no where to sit or stand and you end up sitting at a machine losing your money. lol"}
{"text":"I myself being in the industry and my friend being an inspector for the health department, experienced the worst service today for lunch from our server TAYLOR. 

She did greet us, in which we ordered our drinks, and asked if we were ready to order which we were. I ordered a roll and asked for easy rice, good roll, don't think they got the request on my easy rice though. I ordered an egg drop soup, and asked for the crispy noodles that normally come to our table, I frequent the PH location a lot. Most of our food was dropped off by the runner who was the nice part of our experience. 

My friend ordered dumplings in which they were out, so she got the eggrolls instead. In which we noticed she had a fly in her sauce, well our noodles finally came along w the mustard and s&s sauce so she used that instead. There was also a piece of black fiber in our noodles but that didn't bother us! 

My soup finally came, and our food was served a little bit after, she did come back to ask us how our food was but failed to ask us if we wanted refills on our drinks, my gf didn't but I did! 

At this point my gf's lunch break was over and she was off to her next inspection, so we just asked for boxes and I I informed her of my friends guest in her sauce. She just asked if we wanted another sauce and said that was gross. Never informed a manager or offered to at least get her eggrolls taken off for her, but considering how her coworkers were looking at us, I'm sure she informed them. 

Unfortunately we will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"All I can say is there is no better Chinese food in the country. Try the shrimp and candied walnuts."}
{"text":"Me and my brother walked over to the big party we were meeting with and sat down. The server immediately came up to us and asked what we needed. I just asked for water and so did he. She got them quickly and grabbed us some extra plates to share with everyone else. 

My other brother and his wife came in and ordered alcoholic drinks and food and she got them out to us quickly. She did a very great job attending to our needs especially with being a large group of fifteen.

The restaurant was clean, the food was great, and the service met my expectations."}
{"text":"My wife and I are huge fans of PF Changs, so we thought it was pretty cool there was one right on the strip. It was so convenient to our location that we ate there for lunch 3 times during our stay. The food was so fresh and flavorful!! One of the exciting experiences was sitting on the patio, enjoying a bottle of Hess Cab, all while people watching.  Tyler was our server and he treated us so well!  We even had one of the managers stop by to see how our meal was and just chat with us for a bit.  That made us feel special!  Her name was Kristi.  Kristi, Tyler, and the whole staff were so kind and friendly to us.  It was a great experience and definitely merits a fourth lunch visit in the near future.   Thank you PF Changs"}
{"text":"Service was very slow, we ordered the 4 course meal, and one extra appetizer, one of them came out way before the other. I had Changs Spicy Chicken, tasted like Sweet & Sour Chicken, told server she said it was spicy chicken and offered no fix.  The dessert came way after we paid our bill, and it was the littlest thing I have ever seen. The quality and size of the food has went down a lot from what I have had before. They bring out the smallest bowl of rice with the meal I have seen of this type of restaurant. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent, upscale Chinese chow.  Your check total will include built-in price inflation that pays for the valet, mood lighting, and that big-ass horse statue out front. Regardless, that is what \"fine-dining\" is about, right? We are paying for an experience, not just a meal. 

That being said, service was attentive, friendly, prompt and accommodating on all fronts.  Woo hoooo!  Great first impression there. 

What we gulped and noshed ...

COCKTAILS:
Coconut Lemon Sour - One of their signature cocktails. Light and delicious!
Chang's Mai Tai - Tall, balanced, tropical and gooooood.

STARTERS:
Lettuce Wraps - Their signature item ... Light and flavorful!
Dynamite Shrimp -  Light and crispy coating in a delicate yet spicy sauce! YUMMM
Egg Drop Soup - Flavorful and comfortiing!
Hot & Sour Soup - Dark and rich!
TIP: Ask for a side of the fried wonton sticks to add to your soup.

ENTREES:
Mongolian Beef - Excellent carmelization on the beef adds to deliciousity! 
Sweet & Sour Pork - Very Good, although I prefer a more intensely flavored sauce.
Scallops - Spicy and tender with a slightly crisp char. Fabulous!

Will definitely return to try more!"}
{"text":"Over glorified Panda Express.

Nothing great, nothing lacking. I've had better other places.

Good if you enjoy chinese food but have a phobia of chinese people."}
{"text":"Good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef.  Bar service was fast and Efficent.   Good value.  Not a 5 cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat.   Fortune was even Postive!"}
{"text":"While traveling to Charlotte for business I used Yelp to help me find a decent meal for the night. I was surprised to see the comments and star ratings for this place as I have eaten here numerous times in Scottsdale (home) and always enjoyed the experience.
I sat at the bar and was greeted with a smile by Jeff upon taking my seat. His service was great and he interacted with many of the guests frequently throughout the hour or so I was there.
The food was served in the proper order with time between each course. The food was as I expected and didn't disappoint. 
On this occasion I'm glad I trusted my \"gut\" and didn't base my decision on the Yelp reviews alone.
My advice....sit at the bar and ask for Jeff. He'll take care of you:)"}
{"text":"Love the workers very nice service is great food is good! Never regret coming here! Always satisfying!! No reason to not give it a 5 out of 5!"}
{"text":"I've had pan-Asian before and not liked it. I've been to
PF's before and had the wrap that everyone raves about - not my taste at all. So, a couple of friends and I went the other night. I decided that if I couldn't find a healthy (IMHO) vegan offering, I'd have water only. To me, healthy is NO sodium and NO fat added. Basically impossible to order that from any menu at any restaurant. PF had nutritional info listed on-line. One, and only one, dish fit my bill. But, it's one more than most restaurants. Buddha's Delight. Brown rice and steamed vegeys. Nothing else added. Exactly what I needed and was looking for. Healthiest (for me) meal yet. My buds enjoyed their meals and I enjoyed mine. Staff was courteous and friendly and efficient. If it pleases my friends as well as my taste buds AND it has a vegan AND healthy offering, how can I give it anything but 5 stars?"}
{"text":"I do agree that this place is above the standards of most Chinese restaurants.  The taste is better and the quality is way above average.  The only problem with everything PF Chang's has to offer would be the price.  Yes, we pay for everything: the food, ambiance, and service. My friends were out there for a late night dinner. We happened to sit next to two groups of people celebrating birthdays.  The first table started to sing Happy Birthday.  10 minutes later, they left.  Five minutes after we finished eating, the other group started to sing Happy Birthday.  It was a trip. 

I wanted something simple, since I was at the restaurant Nobu earlier with friends at the Hard Rock Hotel.  Had the ginger chicken with broccoli for the entree with brown rice.  My other 2 friends had the exact same thing, which was the honey walnut shrimp with white rice.  One friend opted for 2 bowls of ice cream and a cup of expresso.  I didn't have anything else.  

I have my reservations of this place, since this place is expensive.  Granted that this place is kind of better than stereotypical Chinese restaurants, it is pricey. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Last Friday my family & I went to this PF Changs for the first time for my mother in laws birthday.  Being newly vegan, my husband & I are limited on our options.  We were seated in about 1/2 the time we were told which was super and when I explained my food restrictions the waitress was very sweet and went back to grab a special list of food items.  Instead of her bringing out the list the manager Todd came out to us and went over options and even assured us they would cook our food in a fresh pan with new oil etc - which we thought was pretty great!  Our order of vegan choices were delicious...however, accidentally the waitress brought out shrimp dumplings instead of our vegetable dumplings and it wasn't discovered until I ate one and was halfway through the second one which might explain why it was extra delicious....(I AM SO SORRY SHRIMP FAMILY -- truly it was an accident)

The waitress felt so bad and apologized for the mistake - I am sure this will never happen again...she saw how choked up I was about it - as I was crying for the shrimp a little....but she was so empathetic and took full responsibility for the error and of course later a woman from the back (chef maybe?) came out to also apologize and made us a vegetable batch at no charge...At the end of the dinner, believe me the food for us was great, even for the two at our table that are carnivores they loved their chicken and enjoyed our vegan choices as well.  By the time we were done packing up our left overs - Todd came over again and had told us he had taken care of our dinner as well as gave us a card to come back again and try the vegan dishes all over again.  We couldn't have been more grateful for the AMAZING service from him as well as the wonderful people that he has on his team.  They may not be vegan now...but with that kind of care & compassion...it might be in their future one day.  

We are now a fan of this PF Changs - I am huge on great service and I felt they completely handled it they way I would have and I am thrilled to see that in a large restaurant chain!  Great job!"}
{"text":"Have been a fan of P.F. Chang's for years - have enjoyed many meals across the nation. This experience was not the consistent meal I've come to depend on from P.F.  Food was undercooked and just plain tasteless. Sent one dish back and the second was something I would have liked to have sent back as well but was convinced there was no getting a good dish at this establishment. So disappointing. Corporate needs to take a look here -- only a few folks here tonite. I no longer wonder why. :-("}
{"text":"Mediocre experience at best. There are SO many really, really good Asian restaurants, this chain should be ashamed for the service and mediocre food it serves. From the in uninspiring appetizers, to the inauthentic and average entrees, and untrained staffing, PF Changs is incomprehensible as to it popularity. I think it's popular because people have become accustomed to average, main-stream, uninspired Asian cuisine. The prices are a bit high, the portions are small and the jeans-attitired staff is no better than a mall food court."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but we have gone in 3-4 times (because it is the only Chinese food in the area) and the service has been awful every time. 
We tried to call in an order and it still took them an extra 20 min then they said it would take to get our food. 

This last time they only had one server working. I felt really bad for the guy."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic.  I ordered a hodge podge since it was happy hour specials.  I got the wonton soup, calamari, and steamed pork rolls, and we shared crab wontons.  The crab wontons were good, and the sauce was really good.  The steamed rolls were very good too.  The calamari was rubbery and lacked seasoning.  The wonton soup is decent."}
{"text":"I love P.f Changs! Nice atmosphere, good service, and amazing food. I came here with my boyfriend for a date night and we ordered the honey shrimp, spicy chicken, fried rice, and egg rolls. Everything tasted great, I really just wish the portions were bigger. 

Our server was Matthew and he did a great job. Was on top of our drink refills, kind, etc. 

Will definitely be coming back often."}
{"text":"Super clean. Love the bar here. It's gorgeous! Nice decor. 

We came at 11:00am. No wait. Customer service is superb! Waiter was so attentive & kind. 

Wonton Soup: 5/5. U can order the small portion (small bowl) or the big portion. Spinach, chicken pieces, wontons, water chestnut. So delish!!!

Long Life Noodles w prawns: 3.5/5. The prawns are super good. The noodles had this pungent taste that wasn't much to my liking.

Chicken Noodle Soup: 3/5. The clear thick noodles were similar to udon noodles. So good. Chicken in here is really good. I just didn't like the taste of tomatoes in my soup. 

We were in dire need of hangover soup so decided to come here ;)

Food came out pipin hot so u know it was just made. Service was impeccable :)"}
{"text":"Our favorite spot for Chinese food. Food is always great. The wait staff is always great. We loved it so much we chose it for our rehearsal dinner. They did a fabulous job setting up getting our cake from the vendor and getting a set menu of food out to us right away. Everything went very smoothly. Thanks Joe!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here, and I have to say it was great. The food was very flavorful and the service was great. Will definately eat here again and soon."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with my family on last Sunday night. The place was busy and there were 2 groups ahead of us but we were still told the wait was only 10-15 minutes. My husband asked if they needed his name and was told no, that they'd just grab us when a table was available. Both parties ahead of us were seated quickly and a few minutes later I hear \"Luis, party of 3\" we didn't move because she never took our name and my husband isn't Luis. The hostess said it again this time looking right at us and she seemed irritated. I said we're not Luis and you didn't take our name, she then proceeded to wave us to follow her. I must admit, the place looks run down. Our table looked dirty and the rail behind us was filthy and greasy with finger/hand prints all over it...yuck!

I think allowing the hostess to wear whatever is very unprofessional and the servers don't look very good either. 

Our server was extremely polite and when I explained my son has a nut allergy he assured us there were no nuts in anything we ordered (chicken lettuce wraps, tempura cauliflower-awesome, honey sesame chicken, Mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken-gross barely ate it and still paid for it). 

The food was good except the sweet and sour, skip it by all means...they were out of the beer my husband ordered which was disappointing. Oh and when we arrived there were a bunch of crackheads tailgating in the parking lot and using a bucket as a toilet, when we were leaving there were homeless people camped out of the other side of the fence getting ready for bed...dirty restaurant + unsafe parking lot = never coming back to this location. 

I only came here because we were at the mall and it was close, I usually go to the Boca Park location which is much cleaner and no crackheads/homeless people in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Terrific Asian meal! Suggest reservation if you don't go on a weeknight! Gets very busy. Wonderful dessert choices. Our waiter, Troy was excellent!
Would give 5 stars, except the salmon was a bit dry, & they charged me $1.50 to substitute any vegetable for the red pepper slaw, which I don't care for. That's a bit mu h, & am upper crist restaurant like this shouldn't even charge for that. That's \"cheesy\"! :-("}
{"text":"First time we've ever had a bad meal.   
Cauliflower tempura was delicious

Honey seared chicken.  Spicy chicken and chicken fried rice all subpar 

Hopefully it was just a bad night"}
{"text":"I'm pretty bummed out that the service and food  at this place really declined.  

My wife and I were guided to our seat by a very un-enthusiastic young lady who neither smiled or spoke a word to us.   We sat for about 10 minutes, while workers busily buzzed around us, without being acknowledged by anyone. Our server finally showed up took out order and disappeared. Except for a few refills and to slam plates on our table she just wasn't around.  Our food arrived sloppily plated, overlooked and over sauced."}
{"text":"They have good food.  It's unique.  It's got some strong flavors goin' on.  There are some things two weeks later your tongue will start telling you you need to have again, soon.
Don't go in thinking \"We're having Chinese\".  Go in thinking, \"We're having P.F. Chang's\" and half the battle will be over.
The only problem I've had is, we never have enough room at the table for all the plates of food that show up.  Did we order too much or is the table too small?  Maybe they need to install food parking garages so you have 3 or 4 floors of food storage at your table.  That would help.
The mini-desserts are an inspiration from Satan.  You think you're full.  No, no, I don't want dessert.  But they have a \"mini-dessert\"!  It's just $2!  You can just have a little bit!  Well, ok, in that case..."}
{"text":"Yesterday, my boss and I had lunch here. PF Chang's quality is usually the same from one location to another, no surprises. We both had Chang's Spicy Chicken and Hot and Sour soup. The chicken was fine but the soup was terrible. It was cold and didn't have any flavor, a huge disappointment. 

The server was an extremely nice guy. Because of his service, I am giving this establishment, three stars. Not too impressed with this location. The Las Vegas location is much, much better."}
{"text":"I literally left minutes ago and will never go back. I love PF Changs and my spouse and I were so excited to have our date night there. Unfortunately, as soon as we walked through the door the experience was anything but welcoming. The hostess seemed annoyed at our presence and didn't even say hello. The only thing she did ask was \"...2?\" Then she grabbed two menus and lead us to our table without a word, set the menus down at a table where the seats were filled with the last guests' meal and walked away. 
   We waited almost five minutes for our waitress to greet us and I can't say she even did that. When she awkwardly stopped in front of our table I smiled and said hello to which she responded with \"What can I get you?\" Not \"Hello, how are you?\" \"My name is so-and-so\" nothing, absolutely NO customer service. We felt like we were not welcome. As if we were irritating the staff with our business. I asked for a wine menu and she said Its right here and didn't offer any selections or anything. Before I could look she said she'd be back with waters and as soon as she left the waters she walked away again. We left instantly. We are still going to have our date night and do not need to be surrounded by a bunch of people who hate their jobs and haven't the slightest idea what customer service means. So disappointed and this location is an utter disgrace to a once enjoyable restaurant. If there was an option for no stars I would have chose that."}
{"text":"First time for my wife and I. Server was excellent and our meals came pretty fast. The won ton soup will definitely bring me back. Very enjoyable experience. Thanks."}
{"text":"I don't know why, but it's always hard for me to get overly excited about a chain restaurant.  I like PF Chang's and it's a nice place to have an asian-inspired meal.  It's especially good for people who are reluctant to try different types of food outside of the usual american food (it's a good place to take that first step).  For some reason PF Chang's has a hard time getting repeat business out of me unless I'm meeting up with friends and they picked the restaurant.  

I went to this location on a Wednesday evening to meet a group for a birthday party around 8pm and this place was overflowing with people.  I have never felt so grateful to have a reservation.  We had one waitress for a group of around 11 people and she did a surprisingly good job of keeping all of our orders straight and staying on top of drink refills.  At the time I was trying to watch my calorie intake closely and there weren't too many low-cal entree options.  I ended up ordering the chicken lettuce wraps with extra spice.  They were decent but probably not something I would ever crave.  The hubby ordered some kind of spicy chicken-coated-in-sauce entree that didn't seem to have too much flavor.

Overall, ok food at slightly above average cost."}
{"text":"Three stars for the prices, food is great loved the lettuce wraps and service is ok.
I would recommend who loves Chinese food."}
{"text":"AKA the land of overpriced Chinese-American food. This was a last resort as we struck out and had to walk out of two other restaurants this night. Somehow with less than 10 people eating around 10pm, we still had to flag down a waiter to find out who was serving our table. I probably shouldn't even be eating this type of food as I have soy issues, but went with the soyless and tasteless honey chicken as my entree along with some unplanned crunchy rice. Another order was the heavy on the grease and oil loaded fried rice with five types of meat, which I did not try. I suppose 15 bucks is the going rate for a entree at night, but the quality just isn't there anymore. Even most lunch entrees top the 10 buck mark now. I still fondly recall those early days of this franchise when PF was the man - now PF is the old man."}
{"text":"Today My son and I went to lunch at PFChangs .I was really craving their food and I can't begin to say how fantastic we were treated. I am currently going through chemo treatments and food right now  isn't always easy to eat. The food was delicious right down to the desert!! Upon casually talking to our waitress, Ash. I happened to mention I was going through these treatments. When it came time to pay, Ash said \"no charge\" myself and PFChang's want to take care of the bill for you. What a Blessing. Such wonderful food and wonderful staff! When I tried to leave a tip, Mary Beth the manager said No, this was my day and she would take care of it. You can be assured that I will be a longtime customer at this restaurant. I hope to get back there again soon!!!

{"text":"Will never go here again. After seated I seen that there were 8 booths available and asked to be seated in a booth. They told us no that all the booths were reserved for reservations. That the next time they had an opening was at 7pm. I mind you we went at 4:00pm. Disappointed will never eat at this restaurant chain again."}
{"text":"We went to PF Chang's today, you know as far as chains go it is decent.  There is bound to be something for even the biggest food snob and the timid eater.  Isn't that what a chain restaurant is?  Food for the masses?

We had shrimp dumplings, Mongolian beef and shrimp, scallop & snowpeas.  Not my choices, but I was with two people, I just let them order and we shared, no biggie.  Sometimes you just have to go with the flow.

Service was great.  In fact, our server was so professional, I need to send PF Changs an email, he was perfect.  He was friendly, never intrusive and knew we were celebrating a birthday and brought us cake, he didn't have to do all that!!  

I like to go to PFC about 3 times a year.  It is what it is!"}
{"text":"Gave PF Chang's another try as they are near my home and I suffer from Celiac disease and they are one of the few Chinese restaurants where I can eat.  We ordered online.  Arrived at the time stated that order would be ready.  Food was cold!!!  And overall it just was not good.  They have continued to go downhill!!!  I will not return."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain. But I had a coupon for a free appetizer and a $25 gift card to use. Lunch came out to $4 and change- hard to beat. Our server, Regina, was fantastic- patient, personable, and professional.

Newly quasi-vegetarian Hubby had the coconut curry vegetable dish and really liked it, except for the bizarre texture of the \"silky tofu.\" It was like warm custard in a chewy rectangle. We're just learning about  this tofu thing. I had the Cantonese scallops which were cooked well, but should have been cleaned better- most had some grit. The dish was a little mild, even for this Midwestern girl. The crispy green bean app was really good- green beans flash fried in a salty tempura so the beans also stayed crisp.

Look, people. \"Cheating\" on Big Wong and Gourmet House with PF Chang's is like Hubby cheating on me with a blow-up doll. It doesn't exactly count. It was just a cheap thrill when we found ourselves on the wrong side of town."}
{"text":"We used curb side service. Food was ready at the time we were given, and it was very good! They had everything we order. Not only do I recommend the food, I'll definitely be back! Can't say about the inside, this was our first experience as this location..."}
{"text":"The worst service ever! Not only did we get ignored but even the manager was cranky. When our food finally came, we had them pack it up so that we could take it home. I really dont mind waiting for my food but the staff  was not nice. That bothers me the most."}
{"text":"I like PF Changs.

I think I've only been here a total of three times (twice it was take out), and I only get vegetarian dishes, but what I've had has been pretty tasty.

I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Sadly I've been here a few times because it's a crowd pleaser when my girlfriend's parents come down to visit. There's nothing really WRONG with it. The portions are big and the food is \"alright\" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.

The food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.

Last time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.

Obviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price."}
{"text":"Excellent service, continuously tasty food, nice atmosphere, and a large variety of tastes and flavors. Even my picky M-I-L loves it! Winner in my book."}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time deciding btwn 2 or 3 stars. My first visit ever to a PF Changs. I am liking the outdoor seating. Looks like a great place to mingle. Liking the interior and enjoyed the round table our party set at with the lazy-susan in the middle that spins. Really impressed with the care and kindness of the staff in general and the manager. Some of the best attentiveness I have come across in lunching in AZ in a long while. 
Glad they didn't add the gratitude to our party of 6 lunch tab. Because we split the bill in 5ths to celebrate a birthday and our waiter (James) was awesome and we gave him more than the standard tip.  And I think tacking on gratitude is a tacky move for lousy service in many cases.

But I sampled several things on the menu from among our table; Garlic noodles by far was the tastiest to me, Spring rolls had an old greasy after taste, Lettuce rolls looked gross yet why they are so popular I've no clue for they taste so-so, hot n spicy soup well I have had better elsewhere, chicken fried rice- well it was slightly different but not enough to win me back, and last sesame chicken - very pretty to look at but I have certainly had more flavorful in less fancier places. 

So you see what score do I rate them when the atmosphere and service is grand but the food not so grand? 

My friends love the place. Couldn't believe I had never been to one in neither AZ or WA. And though I may return because my friends pick the place and I not put up a strong protest, because it's a comfortable place. I'm sure I want be selecting it or likely to return otherwise... unless its to drink heavily at the full bar and hangout with friends. Most likely I'll eat somewhere else first. But then if I drink heavily maybe the food will taste as well as it is presented? Now that might be why my friends think the food is so grand! 

Also I must say that this location is a wonderful people watching destination. The cross of cultures, the fashions and uniforms that arrive made want to talk to everyone. Also for that reason I'm going to say this place is dressy rather than casual. And lastof all the waitstaff all so cute and young made me wish they could have had a few cute mature waiters to look at and drool over since these could have all been my children age wise. 

I'd like to give them 2 and half stars but since I can't I'll be generous and say its 3, because they're so nice. But if I visit again you'll have to earn all stars fully based on menu."}
{"text":"Right. I know you already know this is a chain & it's \"Americanized\" Chinese food. Oh well...I like it!

As with other places, I crave PF Changs every so often.  I could marry their chicken lettuce wraps! They're a must every time I go.  Now for entrees, I go with the Kung Pao Shrimp (HUGE shrimp!) & egg drop soup. Perfect tempature upon arriving at the table...always.

Oh & they have the PF Changs for Two option. All I can say is DO IT! It's a value conscious decision! Each person gets a choice of soup, an appetizer (starter), choice of entree & 2 desserts. So necessary!

Because the mall is right behind it & it's on a major highway, be prepared to wait. They stay busy. I like their take out option too. They are always so friendly, throughly go through your order, & make sure you're happy.

The wait staff are nice, personable & professional.  The resturaunt is always clean, too."}
{"text":"Bartenders are friendly funny and awesome! 2 small TVs in the bar only. Happy hour is a steal!!"}
{"text":"I have always heard that this place was over priced mediocre Chinese food so the wife and I gave them a try since everyone's taste is different. I can honestly now say that P.F.Chang's is not over price mediocre food but over priced sub-par Chinese food. The Mongolian beef tasted like it was beef flavored salt, we tried the wonton and egg drop soup and both was not very tasty at all. The lo main I ordered was so drown in soy you could not taste anything else. The only good thing was the dessert wontons and the egg rolls, both of those were ok."}
{"text":"Good food and service by George we will be back , last night with female server was not to good .but I'm this is for today and happy we came back ."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Only get here about 1x a year for a special occasion.  Went last night for a much needed date and my bday dinner.  The server was extremly nice when she did talk to us.  Chicken mixture for the lettuce wraps was cold and super spicy, tempura roll was good, honey chicken was soggy and had a not so fresh taste.  Barely any noodles in the Lo Main, almost ALL carrots.  Can't say we will be back.  NOT worth the money or time.  Panda is even better now.  Sad how this place has fallen to mediocrity at best."}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant every now and then. It's not spectacular, but good and the mix of college crowd and 30-somethings makes for an upbeat atmosphere.
the lettuce wraps are a must, and i'm pretty sure most of the sauces are vegan-friendly, so for a \"regular\" type of restautant, those with restricted foods they can eat should have plenty of options here.
there's lots of outside patio seating, which can be fun to people watch on Mill Ave. on a busy night, but i find it can be way too loud with those who like to show off their motorcycles (happens quite a bit on the weekends on this \"strip\") so be warned.
there are also lots of trees, so be wary of getting bombed if you know what i mean. it's happend to me before, so i'ts something to think about if you're here on a first date!"}

{"text":"My favorite dish, chicken in black bean sauce, is no longer on the menu, but they happily made it for me. The remodeled building looks great , and the new lighting looks good too. 

I have been to this Chang's many times, and have never had a bad meal or anything wrong with my visit. They set the standard for consistency that I measure other places by."}
{"text":"OMG...the Bacardi mojito was Fabulous and the bartender was awesome..although they did mixed up my spring rolls with pork egg rolls...my sister had the Mongolian beef super tender a lil salty for me and they were skimpy on the rice!

I had the chicken soup too die for ummmm mmmm good!! I gave it five star because overall it was good and crowded lol"}
{"text":"Food was good but the customer service was awful. Order was put in wrong by the waitress so our lunch time was extended. Nothing was done to rectify this. When we got our bill, the bill was entered incorrectly as well. Lunch for two took over an hour."}
{"text":"I previously reviewed this eatery as 2 stars because of poor quality food and service.  What a change 12 months can make.  I had no intention of returning to this restaurant but my son gave me a gift card.

Chelsa the server was fantastic.  She gave us just the right amount of time to review the menu before returning with our order.  Our drinks were never dry.  Our main coarse was at the table within moments of finishing our appetizer.

The food quality was excellent. I had the Sea Bass.  It was cooked perfectly, moist and almost flaky. It was flavorful and a very good size portion (about 7-8 oz) and it was nestled on a bead of lightly sautéed spinach which was neither too wilted nor too undercooked.  The dipping sauce that came with the course was delightful.

My wife had the Mongolian Beef with extra green onions.  They got the proportions of meat to vegetables perfect.  The beef was melt in your mouth tender.  The sauce that was enveloping the slices was well balanced in flavor, it added to the beef and vegetables without overpowering them.

The manager Ryan was interacting with the staff in a very positive way which helped ensure a uniquely pleasant dinning experience.  He has done an incredible job turning the food quality and service around.

Many thanks, we'll be back"}
{"text":"Terribly slow service waited 45 minutes for entrees and they refused to accept yelp offer.

{"text":"Those of you who gave Changs a good rating must not know good food or service.  My wife , Daughter , and I visited last Sunday and found the food terrible the service almost non existent.  My Wife had Shrimp that came out greasy.  Sent it back came out after my Daughter and i had finished.  Stated they had to do it twice. Came out the same as before. I had what they call Korean BQ with kimchi.  Well it was luke warm and the meat didnt have a taste.  I know kimchi and this dish didnt have anything like it. Korea needs to sue them slander. Talked with a neighbor last night who said he and his family experience the samething thier last visit and He emphasised last visit.  So to those of you who like the place continue to spend your money on over priced lousy food."}
{"text":"The food was just meh, and my stomach still hurts. The beef was gristly and salty in the orange beef.  The orange rind was too much in the dish. Truly the dish was straight up awful.  The crispy green beans - normally a favorite were just less than mediocre.
I am a fan of PF Changs, but this was terrible.  A true reminder that not all chains are created equal.  Stay away from this store. I was not feeling well at all later. 
Kudos to staff, attentive great and trying hard."}
{"text":"My husband and I thought the food was \"good\" but we give 5 stars and recommend this place 100% for its ambiance, the price we paid and the service provided. 

Our waiter, Patrick, was absolutely fantastic.  He was pleasant, very attentive and anticipated our needs.  My husband and I had a late lunch during the quiet time - 1550h-ish.  That might have helped the fast and thorough service, but I would still give 5 stars anyway.  I am Asian and I love (and know) Chinese food.  This was my first time at P.F. Chang's and I thought our check was quite small for what we experienced and I definitely do not think their food is overpriced."}
{"text":"I love P.F Chang's, but this location is amazing! When I went we were is Sean's section and this guy was just amazing! Super funny, knowledgable of the menu, and kept us well informed of where our food was on the line."}
{"text":"Love coming to PFChangs Northlake.  We will give it a 5 star when they get a bigger gluten free menu."}
{"text":"Who goes to Vegas & goes to PF Chang's? Rofl. Well, we were hungry, staying at Planet Hollywood & had been up since 5am. Sooooo, this is how we ended up here. PF Chang's is always great. No wait, service was good & the food was delicious! No complaints!"}
{"text":"I truly love everything about PF Chang's I don't get the chance to go often and when I do I am usually very happy with my food.  I love my warrior card that gives me great discounts every time I stop in.  I think PF Chang's has done a great job marketing themselves in this economy offering good food at great prices.  That being said I stopped in for lunch last week and was so disappointed with the food and lunch specials in general.  I ordered a tofu dish with veggies and brown rice the specials come with a choice of soup or salad which is great and the prices range from $7 to $16 or so a dish.  Anyways I had to dig through my veggies just to find 1 of the maybe 5 pieces of tofu that were actually in my dish.  My coworker ordered the sesame chicken and he had a lot more shrimp then chicken in his dish oops.  Good thing he wasn't allergic to shellfish.  Overall the service was good but I will not be coming back for lunch."}
{"text":"Best service we've had, really freindly servers and a really freindly and accommodating manager. I really love to food too. Well Come back to eat here."}
{"text":"Online ordering was easy and a time saver at work. Be advised that you only pay for food not tax - it gets added anyway. 

Pull into one of three handy curbside spots, call  restaurant, someone comes to take payment and delivers food! Order was packed well and correct. 


Food suffers a bit from not being served table side, but not a problem really. Joined rewards because I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've never been a huge Chang's fan.  It's okay but never my first choice.  I had lunch here last week and while the food continues to be average, the service was fabulous. They made my salad with the wrong dressing and brought me out a whole new salad (I honestly hadn't even noticed)."}

Same taste wherever you go.
Good and bad, even you can get the same taste at the Walmart refrigerator/ frozen food section.

Parking: Good"}
{"text":"Now i love this kind of food so I was excited to try
My total bill was 31.50 ish. The pictures are what my 17.50 Mongolian beef looked like. The rice was half full.
The menu boasts family style so we only ordered one entree each. My fried rice was shrimpless... i didnt realize there wasnt but a few shrimp until the person eating the beef, who was starving still, asked why i ordered plain rice? Im so discouraged because we drove 10 miles to try it. I drop 20 at Panda and get three entrees and its a lot. I could NEVER justify eating here again.
***update: food was great though, despite the fact that the portion was unrealistic the food was very good. So, its ONLY fair to upgrade stars. I may try eating inside next time to see if it makes a difference."}
{"text":"\"Sammy\" is \"The Gal\" to ask for!!!! She is prompt, happy, friendly, and gave us SUPERB service!!!! With trying to cut carbs now a days, Sammy told us we could request anything on the menu NOT to be breaded! We will definitely frequent P.F. Chang's more often now, with knowing our food preparation options and having Sammy as our waitress!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, very bad service.  We have eaten there at least 15 times (yes the food is good enough to ignore the bad service) and I can say the service has been lousy at least 10 of the 15 times. Great food though!"}
{"text":"I know it's a good chain. However, I can not get enough of their vegetarian lettuce wraps. Plenty of options on the menu, and I'm usually very satisfied with my meal. A little on the pricey end though."}
{"text":"This is I guess considered a chain since they have them every where you go.  Haven't been for some time since there isn't one near where we live so this was going to be a treat.

We were smart enough to stop and make a reservation so when we got back we didn't have to wait at all and our server was very prompt bringing us water and taking drink orders.

However, when you pay that much for an entree, it should be really good and this was just ok.  I ordered sweet and sour chicken and seriously it was just barely enough for one person, the portion sizes have really decreased.  We did order some garlic spinach which tasted good but had so much oil from the stir fry that it felt greasy in your mouth.

My friend ordered Pad thai and said it was just ok.  She did ask them to leave out the tofu which they did.  Other than that it was nothing to write home about.

Given the choices of places to eat near by, this wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"We arrived around 4pm on Friday, 2/10/17, sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by a friendly bartender named Shelby.  My partner and I ordered appetizers from the Happy Hour menu; pot stickers, lettuce wraps, egg rolls, chicken satay, and cauliflower tempura. To drink, I had an ice tea and my partner ordered a sangria.

All 5 appetizers arrived within 7 minutes of ordering, lightening fast service.  The pot stickers, egg rolls and lettuce wraps were great, as expected.  The chicken satay disappointed in that it had an extreme lemon flavor that was very distracting and the peanut sauce was not what I remembered and did not have that traditional \"peanut-y\" flavor. 

The cauliflower tempura however was the star!  Lightly battered and perfectly spicy, it was truly an epicurean delight! This appetizer is in my top 5 of all time.  WTG P.F. Chang's!

Then this happened...

While eating, a man sat down at the bar, a few stools away from us and I immediately knew he was a problem by the things he was saying to the bartenders.  He did not prove me wrong, within 2 or 3 minutes, he got up, approached me, and began asking questions and making statements, all of which were completely inappropriate.  After asking him nicely to leave me alone at least 4 times, I started raising my voice at which point he finally started to back away and returned to his seat.  This was not without him continually making inappropriate comments and using expletives. I repeatedly and loudly told him to stop talking to me which eventually caught the attention of a manager who approached him.  I said nothing after the manager arrived, thinking he would eliminate the problem immediately.  Instead, the manager entertained the psychotic rant right there at the bar while the insults continued flying in my direction from this individual that I've never before seen.  After what felt like an eternity (a good 5 minutes), he was finally escorted outside where the manager continued entertaining this craziness right in front of the main entrance.  While this was going on, all of the servers and bartenders apologized profusely and made sure we were ok.  

When the manager finished his \"conversation\", he came to me and asked if I was alright, going on to say that it took him a few minutes to realize this man had problems. A few minutes? The insults and inappropriate comments as he approached the bar weren't enough of a clue?  Knowing the manager has no control over the words and actions of other people this was not his fault.  That being said, he did allow the situation to continue for far too long at the detriment of us enjoying not only our food, but the atmosphere too.  The manager never even apologized for my dining experience being, at minimum, interrupted.  He joked about the close proximity to the Las Vegas strip and the unsavory characters that attracts; this was a poor attempt to make light of the situation.

The bartenders and kitchen staff offered superb service and created delicious food.  Management, on the other hand, not only failed to defuse a bad situation in a timely manner, but allowed it to perpetuate before finally acting on it appropriately; all without so much as an apology.  This ruined an otherwise great time.  I am giving this encounter with P.F. Chang's 3 stars by averaging food score (5 stars) with overall tone/atmosphere (1).

These events will not deter me from returning, I very much love P.F. Chang's. However, being a seasoned customer service manager myself, the lack of strong leadership skills, humility, and possessing the empathy necessary to be a leader was disappointing."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful experience all around! The staff were fantastic, waiter Grant was personable and attentive, the manager, Sandra, checked on us and comped us a dessert. (Our anniversary). The food...always delicious. Especially the dumplings and Mongolian beef. Would recommend this restaurant over and over!"}
{"text":"For those of you that are gluten-free you will love this place. They print out a sheet and give you every single food item with an idea of whether or not it has gluten, soy, dairy etc.  The waitress, Tori, was really patient in helping me carve out an amazing lunch for me and my friend.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First time at this location and wasn't impressed with service initially. We had 6-people in our party and we're celebrating an event. Our greeting was fair, but impersonal. Our initial seating and server left us wanting to leave. After I presented my experience to the manager (Kylie), he promptly corrected our issues and provided us with a great server (Alex) who made our night. The food was excellent and we all had a great time. Thank you Kylie and Alex for a great evening.!"}
{"text":"The bar and wait staff couldn't be better at this location of PF Chang's.  The food and service is better than any other 'Chang's' country-wide.  We just moved here from NY and missed our \"local hangout\".  The bar tenders and wait staff have made us feel at home.  We go at least once per week for wonder food, drink, and company with the staff and other patrons.  Thank you Clint, Gerry, Nate, Kyle, Nick, Angie, et al."}
{"text":"We hadn't been at PF Changs for awhile and now I remember why....
The service was terrible. The silverware was dirty. We waited almost 15 minutes for water glasses to be brought to the table. The waiter forget several things we asked for and above all, the food was tasteless and the portion sizes smaller than lunch sized portions. We were there before the dinner crowd started so the lack of service or food quality can't be blamed on a busy time. Don't think we will be going back there."}
{"text":"Loved P.F.Chang's .
Came here to celebrate our anniversary as we were in Vegas that weekend and we absolutely loved the food.
Though it's not authentic Chinese food but the taste and the freshness of the ingredients well deserve a mention.
I loved the interiors and the ambience.
Definitely give this restaurant a try while you are here."}
{"text":"Still ok but it seems as though they have cut back on the flavor / spice / heat. I am a big fan of the combination for optimum flavor not heat for the sake of heat. It was ok just seemed less flavorful this time. Server was a little goofy."}
{"text":"Love the food and the pick up option is great when the kids are a little under the weather!  Only recommendation I would give  management is on the nights where it is a little chilly (39F) let the curbside servers wear a jacket!  Don't want them to catch a cold!"}
{"text":"An associate of mine brought me lunch. TOGO and it was delicious. We tried the Spicy Chicken that was very flavorful and not burning your lips off. I tried their lo mein, which was delicious with varitey of meats. Finally I had the beef and broccoli with had a ginger/ orange sauce. Very tasty the beef was well cooked and medium, not tough. JUST ALL AROUND DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"P F Changs offers a very good selection, but be sure to call for their actual prices. They will not honor prices as posted on Yelp."}
{"text":"I haven't been to PF Changs in a long time and now I remember why. Their lettuce wraps are very good though, definitely as good as I remember them to be. I recommend getting them, perfect to share or even as your meal. I also ordered the Mongolian beef which was very good. I would just to go Pei Wei though, it's just as good and half the price!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly but slow. The worst part was getting sick off the iced tea. WTH? Our table of 6 ordered lunch and shared everything. All of it seemed fresh and delicious. Only myself and one other person ordered iced tea and we were both hit pretty hard with a stomach bug. Gross."}
{"text":"We ordered sesame chicken which was awesome. My wife's pad Thai shrimp was horrible. Completely dry and one shrimp in the whole meal. We used the 3rd party doorstep service so their hands were tired. Total bummer."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food. Lovely atmosphere for a nice quiet dinner. Great for couples or families."}
{"text":"Yes, is PF Chang's a franchise restaurant like the rest of them.... But the food is good. Served hot & fresh. (Or cold if you order cold dish).  The plates are presented very well according to today culinary standards.  

The service was great. Very friendly & attentive. Always on top of things.  

There is a full bar right in the front as soon as you walk in . 

Yes, it's has an Asian fusion flare & NO this is not authentic Chinese food...just understand that before you give it a review."}
{"text":"I have had PF Changs before at home. And I wasn't too impressed or even pleased with the taste. Too bland, too dry, too negative, And I wasn't looking to repeat the experience. Especially in Vegas. But I was staying at Planet Hollywood and my family wanted dinner. We decided to give PF Changs another try. And boy were we suprised and impressed. Their fried rice was excellent and their walnut prawns. Wow, that's just great right there. Thinking about checking out Palo Alto again just to see if it could live up to the potential that Vegas has given me."}
{"text":"This P.F Chang's is super consistent. I've been eating here for over 8 years. The service never waivers, the food is consistent, and the layout of this particular restaurant creates a smooth vibe. For appetizers you can't go wrong with the ribs, dry rub or sauce. For meals, Mongolian Beef, Salt & Pepper Prawns, and either honey shrimp or chicken or some of my favorites. If traveling to Vegas and you don't want to be a part of the strip, plenty of local hotels and shopping nearby."}
{"text":"Great GLUTEN FREE options if you have an allergy. I always love P.F. Chang's but the Vegas one is way more expensive than the ones in California and I have been to several. Always specify if you are ordering off the gluten free menu."}
{"text":"What a fabulous place. The atmosphere was so peaceful and relaxing. The food was completely delicious. Our server was so attentive. I highly recommend this place for food."}
{"text":"Honestly, the worst service I've ever had. Tried it more than once, and I will never return."}
{"text":"Very good. Better than the one at the Waterfront. Good hot tea selections. I love the mini desserts."}
{"text":"Pf changs was my sister spot to go every year we go the one in green valley ranch best experience the first two years but after this 02/17/2017. My sister want to have there sweet and sour pork turn out they don't have it it wasn't on the menu like Wtf? We order are drinks and are food the server was rushing us like are you ready!!! So we order I got beef and broccoli , my husband order  sesame chicken,my son got the sweet and sour chicken, my sister's man got pepper steak and my sister got fish every meal you order you get your choice of white or brown rice well my husband asked the server I want brown rice but can you add shrimp to the rice? She said\" yes \"okay cool. So it took a long time for the food to come.. When the food finally came it was all mess up my husband's order was not right he order sesame chicken not sesame shrimp the server got it confused but it turned out they didn't have anymore chicken... So everyone got the food but not me. But to top the whole thing off was my sister's fish was ice cold and not cooked I checked it with my finger cold as FUCK.. So we had enough we asked to speak with a manager this woman was the worst ever she didn't care that you served raw fish to my sister and mess up my husband's order and I never got my food. We told her the fish is cold its raw she said I can re fire it we said NO she said she take it off are check okay but nope we looked at it was still on then they over charged us for drinks we never order!!!! The server was trying to rush us again with the check.. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICES EVER AND POOR managment. They don't care about trying to kill you with not cooked seafood we will never go back. And I will make a call to heath dept. FUCK PF CHANG'S ."}
{"text":"Food was good but our server Robin was exceptional! Very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS! 

We love the chicken lettuce wraps from here but my girlfriend and I prefer to get takeout instead of dining in. It's always super busy and they don't staff properly. The place gets so busy and leave tables waiting but then you look up and there are 4 hostesses just standing around. 

However, their food is pretty good and indefinitely want to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service.  Our waiter disappeared on us multiple times, food was brought out randomly (two plates, then 10 minutes later 5 plates, then lastly my 2 year olds food 10 minutes after that - after we had to ask somebody else to check on it).  Our waiter never asked us for drink refills, didn't bring my daughters drink out until we were halfway done with dinner.  When we asked for the check it took almost 30 minutes to bring it out.  We were planning on hosting our grandfather's 80th birthday party here in August, but have since decided to look at other places to do so."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's has a great selection to choose from. We tend to always get the same things and they never disappoint us. Today Husband got Hot Fish with Brown rice. I got the chicken Lettuce wrap."}
{"text":"I called to place ONE single to go order for myself right at 11 which is right when they open- she told me that the food was going to be ready at 1145-1150?? I'm sure right at opening it's not that busy that I have to wait almost a whole hour for a single lunch entree? Typically you never wait that long at restaurants to receive your food- there are many other places to go around the area that will serve you much faster!!! So I went elsewhere-
Just note if you want lunch it's going to take a hour 
This isn't the first time it happened to me"}
{"text":"Best food ever!!! I love pf changs but this is just as good! It is always such a treat every time I come to Vegas getting pf changs!! Keep up the amazing service and good food!!!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible.... Everything about this place. First of all the front of the house people aren't welcoming whats so ever. They ignored me and my bf for a while until i said something and then we finally got seated. This girl i swear she was in a bad mood or idk but she was just crabby, and monotone. I ordered the Singapore noodles the dish was extremely salty, i literally tried to swallow it but i ended up spiting into my napkin. I then ordered the Mongolian beef, its wasn't good either.... The pad thai was okay but not good. Everything taste super sweet and just bad. Panda express is americanized too but it taste 100 times better then this crap. I will stick to going to china town for food, the only reason i came here any way was because i had a gift card. Our waitress however was very nice and sweet. She deserves 5 starts. Everything else deserves no stars. Never will be back again this place is just really bad, ive never been more disappointed and disgusted"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Hostess would not seat us (party of 2) when there were at least 5 tables open. Waitress was somewhat nice but could tell she did not want to be serving us. 

The only thing that made it a two star was the food came out as expected. 

Will never return to this location based on poor service quality. Don't waste your hard earned money here."}
{"text":"Terrible service at this particular location. We were asked to sit outside despite the entire restaurant was vacant, may be it was reserved so that's ok but then the server got us our food with no silverware, we waited 15min and then I asked the server that I am still waiting for the silverware and chopsticks he said ask someone else and then I walked to the host who seated us and asked for silverware and chopsticks he said I will bring it to your table and all he brought was silverware no chopsticks, then I thought he will come back but after 5min I walked to him again and his response you never asked so i didnt give, you couod have asked anyone. Poor service."}
{"text":"The crew was wonderful we came in late and they didn't push us out with to go food, they welcome us in and stay open an extra 15 minutes so we could enjoy our meal. The food was quality and cooked with love. I will always look for PF Chang when I'm on the move and look for quality food and service."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to my Chilean sea bass, but the accompanying spinach was plagued with soy sauce. I was hungry so the extra soy sauce improved the brown rice. Moreover, why is it assumed a man is going to pay? The server put the check in front of my husband without consideration for me. She saw me give him the respective gift card and my debit card; however, she then proceeded to give my hubby the check to sign. Yes, women do happily pay! One star for fortune cookie!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this location.  We visited on Christmas Eve and decided to sit outside on the patio since they had the heaters on.  Okay, we wanted to bypass the long wait times too.  We were seated right away and our server was awesome.  The lettuce wraps and sesame chicken were delicious as usual.  I'm surprised this location doesn't have more than three stars.  I was most impressed with the fact that the manager visited each table to make sure all the guests were having a pleasant experience.  He not only visited once (during the appetizer portion of the meal), but twice (once we received the main course).  That in itself deserves kudos!  We'll definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Our waiter was amazing!  Very attentive, funny, great personality and great service.  The food was good too.  We got the 2 for $39.99.  Both got the egg drop soup, not the best I have ever had, in fact, I have made better but it was decent.

We got the tofu lettuce wraps as an appetizer, I love those!!  I love the sauce, the tofu isnt slimy or anything, great texture, nice fresh lettuce, wonderful!

Then for entree we got the crispy honey shrimp and the orange peel shrimp.  Both were fresh, amazing flavors and well cooked.  Served with steamed rice and the waiter insisted we get extra rice so we could take it home for leftovers, so nice!  

Then he recommended the raspberry cheesecake with caramel on top and also the chocolate chip dessert.  Both were really good.  I like PF Changs even though it is a chain, good food and great service.  :-)"}
{"text":"We have been to multiple PF Chang's throughout the US. This was the worst experience by far. Our server Mariam seemed to pay very little attention to our table. We literally had to call her every time we needed something. The food can be a lot better. I had to speak to the manager about the server. He was appreciative enough for our feedback. I hope we get a better experience the next time we visit since we love PF Chang overall."}
{"text":"Tremendous service. The basic menu but with a few extra small plates that I hadn't seen at other PF Changs.  Very nice decor. The only thing I'd fix is the lighting is a bit too dim. Could barely read the menu."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 6pm on Mothers Day and didn't get seated until 7:20 pm. We had asked for a half booth when we had made our reservation and for our party of six a regular booth is to small and we didn't want a table. The manager, Marybeth Garrett bent over backward to accommodate us. When we were seated she had made sure that appetizers were sent out to our table right away, we had a great waitress, the food was excellent and Marybeth came to our table at the end of our meal and informed us that our meals were on the house because of the reservation problem. Outside of the wait we had a great time, and enjoyed our Mothers Day Dinner."}
{"text":"We sat down to eat after Black Friday shopping and already, the service was great. His name is Ryan and he is awesome! The soup came rather late and without us having to mention anything, he accommodated us very professionally. We asked for things that don't usually come out like extra lemons, extra ice, salt n' pepper, etc.. Everything was brought out promptly. His attitude remained very positive and fun from start to finish."}
{"text":"We started our dinner with a nice Margarita. We went with the dinner pkg for two .  I had a very good cup of sweet &sour soup. Lettuce wraps and kung pao . everything thing was perfect! The service was great! 
I don't have Chinese food very often. But this was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night.  The waiter, Jake we had made all the difference,  from his friendly greeting to his interactions through the whole experience. If I could be guaranteed that the service would be like that in my future visits I would try to come as often as i could. The food was good,  my fiancée and I did the Changs for 2. From beginning to end i enjoyed myself,  will be back in the future,  also will be asking for Jake."}
{"text":"Have gone there f0r years with generally favorable food and service.  Ordered take out last night and it will be our last trip there.  The shrimp lo mein was gooey and tasted like melted gum.  The chicken was like wood splinters  It was painfully obvious it had been re-heated numerous times.  The Honey-Shrimp were just sweet and sour sauce on some overcooked shrimp.  The shrimp with lobster sauce was ok and they didn't screw up the fried rice.  Overall a one star is a generous rating.  At least if we ate there we could have sent it back."}
{"text":"Typical PF Changs . Food was good but service was very slow . Lettuce wraps are always a pleasure to eat . I was there on a Sunday and a little wait for a table which was very surprising ."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with my family at this location. I never write reviews but I wanted to make sure I got a chance to compliment this place for their service tonight. They made dinner all about their outstanding service. Usually the food at this chain is pretty good, obviously not a Michelin restaurant but I find it appealing. We had a great time and will certainly return there soon."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner on a Saturday night.  I had the ginger chicken with broccoli.  The sauce was lacking in ginger flavor but they made me a new one with added ginger.  

Not sure I would get it again, but the staff was very friendly and cordial.

Thanks."}
{"text":"Food Great!
Service even better 
Bar Staff the BEST

Lets just say the BAR  service was so good I thought I was at a 5 star restaurant . Now let's get to the the meats and potato of the service. We initially sat down while awaiting our table,  however 12 minutes later we decided to stay at the bar because the waiter Ryan and the young man who took over his shift were impeccable!!!!!! They went into great detail about not only the food, but the WINE TOO.  CAN THESE GUYS GET A PROMOTION.  I WILL BE BACK TO SIT AT THE BAR ONLY....GREAT TIMES 

KINDLY NOTE HOW CLEAN THE SILVERWARE IS (see attached image)..."}
{"text":"I had the chicken lettuce wrap appetizer and the pork pot stickers.  They were middle of the road.  The spicy chicken on the lunch menu was more sweet, and the kung pao scallops were overcooked. My friend who loves all things spicy wasn't pleased with their hot dish, but the wait staff went back and brought out some of the flaming sauce from the flaming won ton dish.  My friend was quite happy with that when he used that to amp up his dish.  All in all, it was nice to have a lunch with a salad or soup option but they lacked taste in the hotness category and overcooking scallops is just not a good thing to do.  I'll try them one more time, but I'm not convinced it'll be better."}
{"text":"We walk into Pf Chings this afternoon took a few pictures unbelievable I think they need a facelift folks it's time you guys ..chairs are terrible chairs are ripped dirty forks you can't do that that's not good service, Pf Chings knows better than that"}
{"text":"I have been here a lot over years love their food. However I would say they are having some manager issues.  Employees hanging out in the bar taking their breaks there eating.  Employees breaks should always be taken out of the view of the customers.  Seems to be all new employees not seeing the old regulars.   Management needs to read Be Our Guest the story of Disney reasons for success.  I don't blame the employees this is a management issue. My suggestion make a place in the kitchen for a break area."}
{"text":"What can I say that you don't already know about this chain? Well, for starters their customer service rocks! The restaurant  may have the similarities in a appearance, bUT the people make the difference. They have a great crew, fun music, and wonderful service."}
{"text":"This restaurant overbooks for reservations and even though overbooked, still accepts walk ins. Expect to wait over two hours in the evening!"}
{"text":"Rice was really dry so they brought out fresh rice, however they never should have served that awful rice in the first place. This one is not as good service as home in la/oc but what do you expect in Vegas"}
{"text":"First time visit to this establishment for a late lunch. Upon walking into the place, the lady with dark hair just stared at us without saying anything. A simple greeting is the least she could do as a receptionist, but not a word? At this time, the restaurant wasn't busy at all, so there was no excuse for this at all. As for the food, we had chicken lettuce wrap and almond cashew chicken w/white rice. Even though they were from lunch menu, the food portion was like a regular meal and the price were $12.95 for the wrap and $9.95 for the other. They both tasted good. Our server was Tara, very nice young lady. If it wasn't for the bad experience at the door, I would have given a higher rating."}
{"text":"Delicious food and kids meal was a great value. Just wish they'd have a LOT more vegetarian dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Jennifer and I had a gift card from a bad experience at the location In Akron. We had been holding off but it finally came time to use it. It was around 8pm On a Friday night and the place was full. 

We got seated right away and our amazing server came up to us for drinks orders and appetizers. She knew the menu and was able to answer our questions. We got egg rolls both pork and chicken and won ton soup. Cooked perfectly w a sweet and sour sauce and honey mustard to dip them in. Mind you I am not an egg roll person or soup but this was good and the sauces went w them perfectly. 

She was also amazing keeping up w our lemon water refills, despite the busy night she was facing. 

I got spicy chicken w a pepper description it was spicy just like i like it. It was just on the brink of having to much spice but perfection. She got sesame chicken that was cooked to perfection. 

The cooks and staff had to be to take overpriced Asian bland food and make it taste like that. Well done to the entire staff and management"}
{"text":"Good food, fine service, but not a destination restaurant.

This area has many better choices.  For a quick predictable meal, P F Chang's is a good choice.  There was nothing wrong with my meal (salmon, rice, veggies) but there were no highlights."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the food served during the lunch or dinner hours but at 3:00 pm in the afternoon it's horrible. I ordered spring rolls and Mongolian beef and brown rice.  The spring rolls were cold - probably been sitting around since lunch. The Mongolian beef was hard - again probably sitting around since lunch.  The brown rice was luke warm.  Considering all things, this was terrible at best.  Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Johnny is awesome!!! He was clearly very busy making all the drinks, taking all the togos, but still he provided awesome customer service while the other staff members just passed me off and hardly made any eye contact or offered him help. The manager also making sure everyone was happy is always a huge plus!! I recommend."}
{"text":"One of the best expiriances I've had at a restaurant in a very long time! I haven't been to changs in over a year but I plan to be a regular after today's visit. Greated at the host stand by a very friendly manager, had a glass of wine at the bar while waiting for the rest of my party, bartender was efficient friendly and funny. Got to the table and our server I think her name was Ashley was awesome! Food was great! Even saw a sever put his tray down at the side of the bar to assist the busy hostess with seating, great team work! Way to go p.f. Changs!!"}
{"text":"I always forget to post a review. I love their pear mojito and vodka drink (can't remember the name).
Followed by Lettuce Wraps and Crispy Green Beans. Then. Honey Crisp, Sesame, or Orange chicken with chicken fried rice.

Any dessert will do. They are all yummy!"}
{"text":"Will update once Manager calls back but until then be careful of Great Wall of Chocolate and its raspberry sauce. We were there 2 nights ago and ordered dessert right before closing. We took home cake. Waiter suggested a new container of raspberry sauce instead of scraping the decorative amount on plate. So he brought it out and stuffed it into the same dish as chocolate cake. Okay so not a fan of non-food items being packed in and touching food items in transportation but...we went with it. Everything got refrigerated as is. Yesterday I pull out cake with small raspberry sauce container. Commenced eating cake after pouring sauce over cake. Raspberry sauce is sitting out on my counter as I continue eating cake. It is 68 degrees in here because we prefer it cool with so much sun outdoors. Next thing we hear is a loud POP. My dog looks just as puzzled because no one is in the kitchen yet that is where the noise came from. Immediately go to find the source of the POP and see the once covered raspberry sauce now has its lid on the floor AND there are specks of sauce all over the counter. The sauce has no doubled in size and is frothing. So now I see a frothy, foamy, lighter wine-colored version of the sauce I just used. Smh... We were busy yesterday so we went about the day not eating anything else. But I kept noticing a nauseous feeling. Gave the sauce to my husband to test (access to labs). My husband calls to say tech says sauce contaminated! So disgusted!! I went to sleep and woke up with same form of nausea. Called PF Changs where the first \"manager\" sent me to another manager. He seemed concerned but wants to call me back after speaking to company. However he was quick to add that the company has \"...no idea what happens to the food once it leaves PF Changs.\" Smh He was quick to add a little \"...no slight to you\" and \"...never heard of this in my 10 years.\" I love Chocolate and that cake was $10 (tax). The last thing I expect from any restaurant was contamination and a quick company-man-response. Folks get any of their sauces and leave on counter for a few minutes and if it froths or doubles in size...capture that mess and call health department."}
{"text":"I recently was treated to a meal at this PF Chang's. We ate here specifically because of the gluten free menu. I had the GF egg drop soup which was perfect. The entrée was the GF Cantonese Chicken. Also equally delicious. The service was great! I'm giving four stars only because the coffee needs improvement. A bistro of this caliber should have impeccable coffee and this was not. I even asked the waiter for a fresh pot which was provided with little better results. I think a better brand of coffee or a new brewing method is needed. Overall the experience was pleasurable and I would recommend this PF Chang's to others. Especially because of their decent GF menu."}
{"text":"The reason for the three star review is that I have a hard time giving a national chain a high score. Where the food is fine and the service is acceptable   I can go into just about any major city in the US and have the same P.F. Chang experience. There is something to say about the standardized approach they have but by no means will this be a unique experience if you have visited there other locations. With that said it's much better than most chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Did you know PF Chang's should have been called PF Chiang, after its co-founder? Them dang Americans. I've had pretty much everything on the menu here, and all over the country too, and it's been consistently great. The bowl of hot and sour soup is INSANELY large. My wife hates it, so it's all mine. MUHAHAHAHA!!! Service is quite important to this place, and I have never not had a fast, friendly, couterous, and professional server at a table or at the bar. Everything here is awesome, and there are some sushi choices for those of you who prefer to eat nearly living things. Haven't had the nerve to try their tacos yet. I do have one beef. They used to give you complimentary fried wonton noodles and three delish dipping sauces. Suddenly, they just stopped. There was no warning, no rhyme, and no reason. There's no message on the tables and nothing mentioned in the menu. You can still get it if you ask for it, but I think that's an underhanded way of cutting costs or time spent at a table."}
{"text":"We dined here a few nights ago. I started off with an apple spice martini, it was great! The food was good. We had a 3 yr old and 7 yr old girl with us, they loved their rice and lo mein. They had fun eating with the cheater chopsticks. The best part of the night was the impeccable service we had from Dave (glasses,shaved head) he was great with the kids, even showed them video of his 9 month old. The manager, stopped by the table to check in and we discovered he was from close to where we live in Minnesota. Was a pleasure Dave and Gideon- we will be sure to return next trip. Oh and the caramel apple wontons from the fall menu-- yum!"}
{"text":"I have been a P.F. Chang fan since I lived in Texas many moons ago.  This one is no exception.  Complimentary valet will win me over time and time again and its location is wonderful if you want to walk across the street and walk that meal off!  Or...sit on a nice bench.  Haha.

Every single time I have been to this location the service has been nothing less of stellar.  I order water a lot when I go out (I don't really do soda) and automatically get stereotyped as \"poor college student that won't tip\" (which, by the way, is untrue) so I get the cold shoulder service.  Not so, even in a place like this.  It's not Morton's but it's still upscale in comparison to Chili's and even Carrabbas.

What to order: Chicken lettuce wraps, Kung Pao chicken (ask the server for extra spicy...if you can handle it!), P.F. Chang's fried rice with chicken (add cashews), and their diet-melting-but-to-die-for dessert spring rolls.  Yum yum yum!  Great atmosphere to de-stress, get a martini, and munch on some awesome food."}
{"text":"Thanks for your great service Theo!  Even the rice was hot for a change :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location regularly since 2013 (2 times this week already) and everything about it is amazing. The location is superb, the staff is always nice and, as usual, the menu is exquisite. 

Sometimes when you're in a rush for work-related lunches, you need stuff done fast. I've told the staff that when it happens and they always go above and beyond to make sure I get my food and my check ready asap. Great management there!

See you guys soon."}
{"text":"I'm a little biased because I used to work here a while back. But think of it as an insiders report I suppose. The chefs in back are amazing and they all work extremely hard. They are really great with working with allergies and making sure your food is up to par. I don't know about you but I don't know to may places that offer good gluten free, vegetarian, and meat eater options. The servers are awesome...I met some really great people during my time there. There's a lot more oomph service wise here than other places I've worked. Extensive training on menu items, cocktails, and wines. Just the meal as a whole. Foods good too...and working there i had a lot of experience to kno...a little too much. salt and pepper calamari, chicken noodle soup, spicy eggplant, and chang's spicy chicken were my favs. Ashley( cute momma with short black hair usually with a flower or bow) and Jamie(cute little blond girl) are two of the sweetest girls I know...oooo almost forgot save room for dessert banana spring rolls are ammaaazzing."}
{"text":"The food was great! I had the California Roll and the Pad Thai. The pad thai was a little bit more on the spicier side but it was still tasty. This is the first time I've been here and I would go again. 

I'm giving it 4 stars because the waitress was sort of slow. However besides the good food it just had a very chill atmosphere. Loved the ambiance."}
{"text":"Came here last Tuesday for a much needed date night. I haven't been to PF Changs in years, and everything was still great as expected. 

Holly was our server and she was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.

 My margarita was perfect size and perfectly made :)

Appetizer- crab wontons, I always love these! 

Entrée- I got Pad Thai with Shrimp, my boyfriend had Salt and Pepper prawns (which I loved)
 My bf didn't like my entrée, but he doesn't like thai food so that doesn't count!! 

Dessert-
Banana somethin-somethin Wontons.  No words.

Overall the service was great, the food and drinks came in a timely manner, and the restaurant was clean! Great food and consistent service as always :D"}
{"text":"With a significant conference in town, it should be no surprise that there would be a wait. In addition, I don't think (but am not sure) that reservations are possible for two people during the \"red hour\". So, the method of stalking the bar for chairs is the best bet - and it works. Besides that, the bar help is very attentive and eager to get you in and out. So, that worked for us.

The PF Chang's food is great. Interesting options prepared well at the right price. Szechuan-style asparagus is a hidden gem - bu there are others!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, it is nothing short of excellent. Their lettuce wraps and crab Rangoon's are GREAT appetizers. Everything is fancied up and is presented beautifully. For example, the wonton soup- it has shrimp, chicken, spinach, AND wontons. If you are hesitant because it is maybe not priced like a regular Chinese restaurant, this is because it is unbelievable quality and design. I got the boom boom shrimp as my dinner as well. It technically is the \"crispy honey shrimp\" but we were able to substitute it for the boom boom, which is a firecracker type flavor. They offer it in appetizer size as well. Our server, Cody, was so sweet and VERY attentive. I have never been here with a sever who seemed u knowledgable or lazy. Cody added immensely to my mother and I's experience this afternoon! 

Will be coming back as usual!!! If you have never been here you MUST give it a try!!! It won't disappoint! :)"}
{"text":"Restaurant was a lot bigger than I expected and was packed with people on a Saturday night. I ordered some sort of Korean chicken that had string beans, onions and cucumbers with it and I also ordered some really good string bean side dish. Though some of the chicken wasn't as crispy as I hoped, overall it was pretty good. I also ordered the Vietnamese lava cake and egg roll with banana. I didn't like the ice cream with the egg roll but the lava cake was ok. Wasn't really my style but not bad!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at a PF's ever and the food was good but what I think deserved the stars was the service. It was the best service I've gotten in a long time. I will be returning when I'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food as always great. Service was AWFUL or server Jai spent more time talking to his friends than waiting on use. I will always go back because I love the food here. But damn really customer service just really bad. An FYI the ladies  bathroom was really dirty not cool for such a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  I think waitress may have been new, but they weren't busy.  We had to get our own silverware and she never asked if we wanted another drink.  We hadn't been to a PF Changs in years.  It appears their prices had gone up and portions had gotten way smaller.  Good was still decent though."}
{"text":"The food and menu selection was excellent! Unfortunately, the service was extremely slow and so was the food to be delivered. You could tell they were understaffed. They have a beautiful facility but need to have a better handle on their process."}
{"text":"PJ is a great waiter.. ask for him when you come in...food tasted great cant beat a PF Chang's I recommend if your in the area dont hesitate..."}
{"text":"We have always had friendly service and good food at this location. We especially love the ma po tofu and spicy string beans! My sangria was less than perfect (only $5 during happy hour) but an overall nice dining experience makes up for it. Will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Jal is the best waitress there, coming from a long trip and haven't eaten he was fast and friendly. He was on time for everything and good personality best waitress ask for thank you Jal"}
{"text":"Just came back from P. F.mChang's, Superstition. We has reservations at 5:30 and were seated right on time. They were busy, excellent service, food, and ambiance. The 7 of us thoroughly enjoyed the evening 
We will be back"}
{"text":"As far as chain Asian restaurants go, PF Chang's is pretty good. I'm a fan of their duck. Another popular dish is the lettuce wraps. Personally, I would choose to spend my money elsewhere, but I have a lot of friends and fam that love this place and I have no problem joining them when this is what they crave."}
{"text":"The curry was awesome.  We had some California rolls with this sauce that was good too.  Great for quick bite."}
{"text":"I actually like it here. I agree with Jon K, not sure why people who come here actually expect real authentic chinese food and then rate it a 1-star. So maybe PF's needs to do a better job of explaining themselves? 

The steamed potstickers with shrimp are super yummy. The mongolian beef is good, but a little greasy (especially if you heat it up the next day), Their fried rice is tasty and whether I've eaten in or gotten take-out, the service has been really good and the food consistent in looks and flavor.

Maybe I'm also getting lucky and not ordering their freezer entrees? I'm sad others had such bad experiences, but it won't stop me from going back."}
{"text":"Another great meal at this location.  We come here 6-8 times a year as its one of my wife's favorites but a little far from Rock Hill for too frequent.  Definitely sign up for rewards program...free apps by email, birthday reward, and earn points for free food.  Our food and service are always good here.  Reservations are recommended and easy and valet is nice since parking is tight. We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Tim our server was awesome. I had the salt and pepper prawns and they were perfect! I always like PF Changs when I am in the mood for Asian style cooking with great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had 2 meals here; one was take-out and one dined-in. 
The food was ok for a fusion chain in Vegas. Otherwise, it'd been below standard. 
The take out here was pretty quick and they had a separate window for take-out meals. It was fairly expensive for what it was."}
{"text":"Came by for a lunch meeting. Great lunch menu and combos. Not really busy and that I like"}
{"text":"We can around 8pm on a Friday night and had no wait. Our server Jamie was very attentive and super personable. Food came out I'm a timely manner, and was fantastic. Would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love P.F. Chang's??? I haven't been back in years and finally came back. This location is always busy every single time I come. We came in with a large party and I expected a wait. The hostess told me 30-45 minutes, which is okay because we have a big party. After waiting for over an hour and my little cousins were whining from hunger, I decided to go up to the ladies and ask them if they had a table ready for us. Keep in mind, it says they close at 10. It was past 9 and I asked the lady if our table was ready. She told me it would be another 30 minute wait because the people at the table we were to be seated at still have not gotten their check or gotten their food. That doesn't even make sense. Of course, I was also hangry so I went off on a tangent and started ranting as to why they told us to wait 30-45 minutes only to wait another 30 minutes when they're about to close anyways. We told them to just seat us at any table and our whole party does not need to sit together. 

The organization of seats is not perfect. They need to develop a better system. When we walked in, I noticed many tables were empty and can easily be pushed together, I don't really know why they didn't put us there. 

The food is overly salted and honestly, the presentation is the only thing separating it from Chinese Take-Out. Also tell me why we ordered White Rice, but there was Brown Rice mixed in. The rice was so dry and I absolutely hate dry rice. Our waiter was extremely awkward and everyone seemed like they hated their job. I also witnessed a lady yelling at whom I believe to be the manager. I think they were just having a bad night or something. Some of the people at the front desk are not friendly and just seem to be standing there smugly judging you."}
{"text":"lettuce wraps!"}
{"text":"i always love going here for a quick bite. 
i went the other night and i had shrimp dumplings as an appetizer 
& the i ordered the Kung pao shrimp and chicken it was soooo good like always . my service was up to par. kept my drink full and i had a good time"}
{"text":"So we have been here one time for a date night dinner and had a great experience and great food. This review is regarding our most recent experience with a large party for a birthday dinner.

We had called and made a reservation. Ahead of time, it was awesome they called to confirm reservation. When we arrived we were seated right away and everything was ready. We had a great waitress Yasmine who was so friendly and helped us get as many happy hour food items and drink items in as we could. For as many separate checks and items that their were she did an awesome job and got everything correct. She was on top of our refills and the food was amazing. 

They brought my cupcakes out that I had brought and even put candles in them. The service was absolutely amazing and the guest in our party were pleasantly surprised and so happy. Also some of the people were first timers and want to return with us again."}
{"text":"The staff was rude, 28 minutes for our first drink. They are so far off their game of trying to make their customers feel welcome this might be our last trip here

4/16/18 it did not get better"}
{"text":"Ah,  P.F. Chang...

I once knew a Chang, but that was a long time ago, and in Borneo, and she wasn't so loud...

This, however, is far, far away from there.

The food is wonderful, the drinks are also good, but, jeez, do something to make it quieter. 

We've been here a few times, and it keeps getting louder, and the one in Pasadena is following suit.

Anyway, a good spot to eat, if the waiter can hear you."}
{"text":"Although the wait for this place was long the food was good. The workers are nice, but I didn't see many of them. I got the street noddles and the beef with broccoli. It was really good, so if you're looking for Chinese food and are okay with waiting, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on Sunday 7.12.09 around 2pm for lunch. I walked into the place and saw a little bit of a difference in lighting from other PF Chang's I've been to. They actually had their curtains open to let in some natural light, which was really nice. You could see the place was clean and it gave the atmosphere a more of a casual vibe. I enjoy eating at places where it's a little more personable with the wait staff, which wasn't the case this afternoon. The wait staff on this afternoon wasn't focused on the customer, which was me. It seemed like a young crowd of wait staff that didn't want to work a Sunday afternoon. I didn't see any genuine smiles from them. They had the attitude of blah, blah blah, here's your food, bye. I ordered the peppercorn beef dish, and my husband ordered the kung pow dish extra spicy. For an app we had 4 spring rolls. The app didn't taste fresh, and the sweet and sour sauce served with it was bland. Our meals were a decent size but low on sauce for some reason. The rice was a little dry. And my husband's extra spicy kung pow didn't have any pow at all. So at this point I was asking myself, why eat here? I could have gone to any neighborhood Chinese place and have gotten the same quality of food with paying 1/2 the price.. I'm really considering being a little stuck up saying that these chain restaurants are expected to have a certain standard, and why can't they go above it to empress me to come back? I think in this type of economy I'm really going to start to eat at the more mom and pop places where you can feel the heart and soul that is put in the dinning experience. I probably am not going to go back to this chain because of this experience."}
{"text":"Always a great experience, their lettuce wraps and mongolian beef is great, great gluten - free menu, the kids menu is on a smaller side, so wish it could be a bit bigger. We were in on Sunday night with a party of 13 (6 adults and 7 kids) so service was a bit slow but otherwise a great experience."}
{"text":"First time we went, server was Jennifer with a trainee in tow. I had the Kung Pao Chicken with brown fried rice, Mrs had Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, we had Shrimp Tempura Rolls for appetizer.  All was very good, but I really don't understand why it costs more for fried rice.  Serving size was adequate, we live near Seattle and the serving sizes are nearly a third more in comparable restaurants.  The server was excellent and answered all my wife's questions, especially about our desserts.  All in all, a great experience and time.  Big thanks to Jennifer."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour. Customer service is nice and right.  Everyone is nice and friendly. 

Delicious appetizers and drinks.  My favorites are the Asian Pear Mojito , Crispy Green Beans,  and Cauliflower Tempura."}
{"text":"Manager named Garfield provided
Excellent service, very hospitable and polite. He earned all 5 stars!"}
{"text":"To go portions are much smaller than when you eat in. Which is ironic since you don't pay any less.
$40 for two meals and there was barely anything in our containers."}
{"text":"It's PF Chang's, it was consistent with their product but something about this location turned me off.  I sat at the bar for HH.  Crispy Green Beans were excellent but my spicy tuna roll tasted like it was pulled out of the fridge and cut.  Did not taste fresh at all.  I wish I had ordered lettuce wraps instead.  Nothing exciting about the staff.  A lot of them seemed to be standing around.  The bartender was friendly but chose to stand and stare into space instead of engaging his customers.  He also had a conversation over me with another employee about clocking in."}
{"text":"I don't care what South Park says, this place rules!

This restaurant is located in the Planet Hollywood Casino.  We went in and were told it was going to be a 45 minute wait.... we were going to leave, but the host told us he'd sit us on the patio immediately.  Awesome!  

From the patio, you have a great view of the strip.  My only complaint was the awkward view of the back of the horse statue.....weird :-)

The wonton soup was delicious!  Big enough for two to share.

If you like tea, try the dragon tea.  I tasted some of my boyfriend's and it was amazing.  And it comes out in this cute little cast iron pot!

Entrées are large, I'd say order soup, one entrée and share!"}
{"text":"We decided it was time for a date night and came here for dinner. We walked in and were seated right away. Our waiter showed up pretty quickly to take our drink order and introduced himself as Mitch. It was an amazing experience and we will be back. We got our appetizer pretty quickly. As soon as we finished the appetizer our table was cleaned off and our dinner was set down. Perfect timing! Every time we finished our drink Mitch was right there filling up our cups. We never had to ask for a refill. Didn't have to wait. It was all like clock work. Mitch was very friendly and a great waiter. The food was delicious! I am leave a happy and satisfied customer."}
{"text":"I have to admit. The one place I thought was not going to be quite good,ended up deserving a 5 point star. The hostesses were friendly,interesting,and very informative. \"CURTIS\" our server was FANTASTIC. Ask for him when you get here.  My trip down here was worth it."}
{"text":"The only reason given a two star was the service. The waitress was very quick and nice. As for the food itself, blah. My hot and sour soup was cold and too thick. Orange peel chicken was ok but too soggy. The main reason was the low star was because of the pepper steak. OMG, it was like eating rock salt. It was way too salty and the sauce was way too thick. 

I have been at to many PF Chang's and never had a bad experience with my meal. I will not  go back to this specific spot. Too crowded and quality of the food went down hill because it's just too busy."}
{"text":"Made a reservation and was thrilled to see that when we arrived we did not have to wait

I was disappointed with the food. We ordered fried rice,  beef and broccoli, orange peel beef along with a Korean chicken stir fry  as well as spring rolls


The spring rolls were really greasy to touch, while the vegetables inside were crisp there was no real flavour 

Both beef dishes were extremely salty. When the manager came around he asked about our meal and we informed him. It was super salty. We diluted the taste of the salt by eating it with the rice. The manager without request took the beef dish we talked about off our meal.  That was nice and totally unexpected.

I liked that while it was busy the noise levels still allowed normal conversation"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.
Food was as usual awesome and we just had the best service with our server as well as the waiter, they were very flexible and overall great service without rushing us in a full packed place..."}
{"text":"Well, hate to say it, but I will never come here again. 
This place has gone so far down hill I will not waste another moment here ever!
The Hostess was great! Very helpful and friendly.
Our table was dirty with dirty dishes on it, the dishes were meant to be clean. But, grease all over them. Gross!

Our food took for ever to come out. It was not good when it did. I never got a refill on my Ice tea. Just have to say , I do not know how this place is still in Business. 
You have to get your parking ticket validated. Which the hostess did, and I was grateful for that. Just have to say.. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"We love P.F. Chang's but man did our server ruin our experience today. 

3 big fails:

1) I ordered shrimp with candied walnuts. There were not any walnuts and they didn't  toss the dish in its usual sauce. So I got soggy fried shrimp with balls of lemon. I brought it up to the server and he went to ask the kitchen. A few moment later he returned and said that they had run out of those ingredients, and walked away. Now, Ideally it would be nice to know that you were out of ingredients of a dish I ordered prior to ordering it but I get it, shit happens. Here was my issue: After clearly seeing my disappointment when the dish was delivered he just walked away. Really? You're not going to give me the option to order something else? Maybe substitute the ingredient for something else? Anything? So much for customer satisfaction. 

Now I'm with my lady and she's the type that never complains because she gets embarrassed by the scene. I get it. I hate complaining myself. So as annoyed as I am I shut up and eat the mediocre dish without my two favorite ingredients. He was nowhere to be seen for a while so I wasn't going to chase after him.

2) There was fruit flies swimming in the soy sauce. Seriously. I showed it to the server and he just picks it up and says, \"oh ya that is gross\" and takes it away. I can't make this shit up. He didn't offer to bring another one over, he didn't apologize, he didn't do anything that you would normally expect. I felt like I was experiencing culture shock.  

3) How long does it take to get change? Did you go out for a smoke or something? If you're reading this you should find a new profession because you're a garbage server.  


Side note w/ positivity. The calamari is always amazing and her chicken lo mein was perfect. It's a classy casual tasty chain worth checking out. Hope you have a better experience than I did!"}
{"text":"I love pf changs. I just moved to the Vegas area and decided to order togo after work. Granted it was busy, but the service I got was horrible. When I called to place the order, after collecting my order, name and number, I asked how long it was going to take, I got hung up on. Ok, no biggie, called back to ask, was left on hold for 7 minutes. I decided to drive down there And do a curbside pickup. 35 minutes later I was still waiting in my car. I called from my car again, I was told they were going to inform someone I was waiting. Still nothing. I went in, and waited for another 20 minutes, i was told they were going to check on my order, no follow up, nothing. I left after an hour.. Waste of my precious time. Didn't get to try the food, the service sucked."}
{"text":"I've never been to this one or any of them in years. I will be back to this one for sure in the near future! Beginning with the hostess who was pregnant with her first! A girl!! I forgot her name but she was kind, funny, sat us with a sweet server with a great personality. I love when staff compliments staff. That happened a few times beginning with the hostess. Our server was Shelby who was patient because I was having a hard time making up my mind. She came back many times, helped me decide, telling me about the dishes. I took her suggestion and loved my meal! I forgot the name of it because I literally changed my mind too many times. Spicy chicken added some veggies, then left my leftovers , was so sad about that. We had a tiny little dessert cup mine was chocolate , so delish! Shelby was the best server, knew when to come back, check in, walk away. She's great at her job! The food, service from begin to end was perfection! I love love love great service!  I will go back, I will not forget my leftovers next time, I will hope that Shelby is there. Thank you PF Chang's! I'd give more stars if I could."}
{"text":"Eh, it's PF Chang's. The food is consistent but the service is always spot on. The only complaint I have with this location is the hostesses. I had a reservation and they were busy when I walked in... however instead of asking if I had a reservation they treated me like an inconvenience and tried to tell me it'd be 30 minutes. When I said I had a reservation the one perked right up to help the other just gave me a stink face. Also, with two-three girls at the front door, the windows of the front doors and bathrooms were atrocious... if that's how they keep their front of house clean.... what goes on in back of house ??!"}
{"text":"Lettuce Wraps! Most people get a little crazy/weird about how much they love P.F. Chang's lettuce wraps. After a busy day shopping at the near by Northlake Mall, my group of 4 stopped into P.F. Chang's to re-fuel and rest our feet. P.F. Chang's is located at a stand alone store outside the mall.  There is plenty of parking, but I would imagine that this location can get pretty busy during peak times. 

I ordered a cup of egg drop soup and the chicken Pad Thai. I'm a big fan of egg drop soup and I like the crunchy bits they bring as a topping. From what others were saying at the table, the hot and sour soup is apparently pretty hot here. The Pad Thai came served with a lime and two very large spoons.  The spoons kind of confused me, but the noodles and sauce were really tasty. 2 people at the table split the lunch for two. For $40 you get a cup of soup, an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. There is also a lunch special for an entree for $9.95 or $10.95. 

Service was a little off on my most recent visit.  It took the waitress quite some time to take our order and bring us some straws.  We arrived before the big lunch rush, so the delay wasn't because the restaurant was packed.  After she brought the soups and straws, we did not see her again until after we had finished eating.  The supplemental waiters were helpful with refilling our drinks and getting us our meal.  

P.F. Chang's is pretty good for chain food.  I think it is generally over priced despite a few specials and the service can be a little spotty.  There is no shortage of food here though and you are really paying for two meals. Nothing overly positive, negative, or memorable about this location."}
{"text":"Last Friday me and my boyfriend came here to eat. It was around 6:30-7 o clock and the restaurant was quite busy. Two people were getting up from the bar so we decided to grab their seats so we wouldn't have to wait for a table. As soon as we sat down the bartender, Phil, immediately cleaned the area we decided to sit at. Phil was extremely busy but got our drink order very quickly. He was even kind enough to put our order in rift away so we could enjoy the happy hour. 

We ordered lettuce wraps, hot and sour soup, and an order or springs rolls. Everything came out quickly and was absolutely delicious. We are until we were full. 

The entire staff here was helping each other and so friendly. We had such an enjoyable experience and will be back for happy hour very soon!"}
{"text":"My first time eating at P.F. Changs.  It was fantastic and I'd highly recommend it.  It was packed but my group only had a 10 minute wait.  We ordered the honey chicken, pad Thai, Mongolian beef and fried rice.  We also had spring rolls and crab Rangoon for apps.  It all was great and some of the best fried rice I've ever had, which is an odd thing to say but it was delish so it's a must have on my list.  Our waiter was quick, friendly and he knew the menu well so he made great recommendations."}
{"text":"Great service and food, the restaurant is always clean and run smoothly. Take out does take a bit long so plan on ten minutes later then quoted."}
{"text":"Never take out. Our food was ready AN HOUR after the time they said to us over the phone. You're not that busy. Figure it out and staff your restaurant appropriately."}
{"text":"It's been a long while since I've visited the Chang.  Went here a few days ago with work colleagues for lunch and ordered the beef and broccoli lunch bowl.  This entree comes with either a hot and sour soup (my choice) or egg drop soup.  I found the soup to be 'meh' -- not great but not bad.  The beef was very salty and I found myself drinking a lot more water the rest of the day to combat the thirsty feeling I had all afternoon.  This place is exactly how I remembered it: a decent choice for a meal that is in the mid-price range.  You won't get standout food, but you probably won't die of any diseases either!  Our server was friendly and came around often to refill glasses/drinks.  

None of my colleagues were 'wowed' by their lunches either, but most of the food was consumed, so I'm guessing no one was super picky either."}
{"text":"Disgusting fake Chinese food is all I can say. This place is for people who want  to valet park and drink wine. This is a place for people to think they are eating Chinese food when they are not. This restaurant disgusts me. The reason I came here was because I was invited as a guest. I would never come here on my own accord"}
{"text":"We love this location! We showed up at 6 pm on a Friday night, probably their busiest time and only waited a few minutes to get seated. Tiffany was very good to us and the food was AMAZING! My wife had the black pepper shrimp and I had the spicy chicken. Both were outstanding in flavor, freshness and preparation. The pork pot stickers were excellent. She recommends the Alamos merlot, which was fantastic. The GM, Chris, stopped by to make sure we were well cared for and we were. Thanks Chris for having a fantastic P.F. Changs for us to return to again and again!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of P.F. Chang's. that being said ... as much as I love eating at this restaurant it has been 100% disappointment whenever I get take out here! Tonight I ordered two of my family's fave deserts to go...the strawberry shortcake. Had it in the restaurant a week ago and it was delicious and enough to share. Tonight it was pathetic and the two large portions I ordered were smaller then the small I got last week and no where near the large size my wife and daughter shared.  There were virtually no strawberries and looked like something 7/11 would have sold at 50%off and the end of the day. Guess we are done with take out there and will stick to the Cheesecake Factory for any desert we order out in the future."}
{"text":"The food was great , different from the Chinese foods I've eating before. And the waiter Zack was awesome , he knows his job he knows the foods in here, if you undecided about your choice he gives you great recommendations ."}
{"text":"Sorry only a 4 star... Our waiter Russell was great!!! Food was ok. We waited about half an hour to be seated, then we noticed debris and food underneath our table. Russell had to get someone to sweep underneath us. Really not fond of front and back waiter service... Back waiters keep bringing us food that wasn't ours. We got our appetizers but the back waiters kept bringing us the same orders, again... One waiter brought out entrees but wasn't our order. It was sooo annoying and unprofessional. We only came here coz we got a gift card, but with that kind of back service I don't think we will be back. If we do come back I will make sure to have Russell as our server. Good job Russell . Thank you."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's = same Chinese food for twice the price(well actually it was less food than normal)...
Good but not worth the extra money or wait since it was so busy. Also the tables inside are packed together so closely.

Not impressed at all.

Visited January 2012"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner and great service by Dan. Dan made the experience absolutely great. Hostesses did an amazing job as well. You all rocked our night. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Service was prompt and efficient we were constantly serviced never once did we have to wait. Food was excellent and priced fairly. I had Korean bbq chicken stir fry. Flavors were a nice combination of sweet and spice. I would definitely recommend this place to others"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. AJ and Ros our servers were incredible. Both very personable and paid great attention to what we needed and if we liked the food. Every place should have customer service like these two!! Food was great too! We will be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"My family went to PF Chang's and really found the food of poor quality.  Excellent service but the service could not overcome cold dumplings, unseasoned fried rice, huge bowls (volume wise) of wanton soup with only 2 wantons, and unevenly cooked orange chicken.  The price was relatively expensive but the quality of food was poor."}
{"text":"After finishing my junk meal I walked 50 feet and lost $200 at a craps table.  That was more fun than eating at PF Changs.  

I wouldn't eat here again for all the tea in China."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today and were seated and helped instantly. The lunch bowls are a great deal. You get rice, your choice of meat, and a side cup of soup for under $9. If you get a beverage it ends up being around $12 for your lunch which really isn't bad for a nice restaurant. Food was great as always and so was the service. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We normally sit at the bar for our service since there are only two of us but on 4/10/2013 we were sat at a table.  It was a great experience.  Neal our server was top notch and he even spiced our one of the dishes we got which was pretty bland.  I gave it 4 stars due to having to send food back that was supposed to be spicy.  Still would go again. Dessert selection here is great too!"}
{"text":"My 4 Stars is strictly for my waitress, I think her name was Danielle. She was excellent!! She was working several different tables in the area and made it look so easy. She was probably one of the most polite waitresses I have ever had, funny thing is...she said she was new. I definitely would promote her. She was so nice, I didnt even tell her my wontons were cold. lol"}
{"text":"Some of my friends would make fun of me for eating at a \"chain\" establishment but there is a reason restaurants are able to turn into chains. They're good and consistently so. The service is great and again, consistent. My favorite dish is the oolong seabass. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The staff was super nice but I am just not a big fan of PF Chang's food. I think it tastes warmed-up, like the food they sell in the freezer section at Krogers lol. I do appreciate them being open late. The drinks are tasty here."}
{"text":"Came here for a light meal before a meeting.  We were seated right away.  Since my back was hurting, I asked if they can seat us on the first floor rather than being seated on the second floor.  

We ordered...
Won ton soup 
Salt and Pepper Calamari 
Steamed rice
White Tangerine tea

Everything tasted great but when we asked for hot sauce as the food came, we got it when we were done with the food.  That part sucked!  Otherwise, I would have given this review solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"Consistent with the other locations I've been to (here in LA.) 

The service was very good, the waiter was very friendly. He was from Boston and was very adorable. I wanted to squeeze him. 

That's all I remember."}
{"text":"We were in the area and looking for a last minute dinner so we took the kids despite the low rating of this location. The food was tasty as the chain usually is but the rest of the problems as described in the reviews here were correct.  

We waited with 2 other groups at the unattended hostess stand for a solid 5 minutes before a harried waiter came over and seated us all in one trip.  Another full 5 minutes before anyone arrived to take a drink order and disappeared. Restaurant was less than 25% full and clearly they had staffing issues. We ordered a few appetizers, four entrees and a bottle of wine (mostly because it didn't seem future drink service would be very reliable). After placing our order the appetizers showed up almost immediately, maybe 3 or 4 minutes. Great I thought! However, then the entrees showed up less than 30 seconds later! No joke. Less than 5 minutes after ordering and all in a 30 second window everything we ordered was delivered. No dinner plates, just the app plates. No flatware. Hunted down the flatware ourselves, used the little app plates and made the best of it. Some really good tasting food as usual but the staffing and service issues???? Wow."}
{"text":"Love this location- the patio is beautiful and always well-kept. Inside is also very clean, and the booths are cozy. Management is always very attentive, and so are the servers. The food is always timely, and delicious. And if you have a large party, the tables in the middle if the dining room are easily moved to accommodate 20+ people. Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"The manager went above and beyond and made my birthday dinner with my friends the best ever!! We had patio seating with a great view of the Strip and perfect weather!! Will definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"This would have been a four star review if they wouldn't have saved the day, literally. 

Ordered take out, since we are now obsessed with their honey shrimp, brown rice, lettuce wraps and broccoli and beef. Not the cheapest but we get quality food and that's what we appreciate. 

Sitting in take out my car battery died. Crapola, just my luck. No jumper cables. So I called a near by yelp friend.. Shout out to Liz R! Anyway, her cables were too short and of course to remedy that problem we would have to ask a pf change customer to stop eating and move their car, no thanks, that's rude and I would never interrupt their meal for my convince. The take out lady was nice enough to bring my daughter a drink, bring me her jumper cables from her car and help us start it. For some reason it still wasn't working, just clicking. She asked her manager to come out and have a look. He did, or well I thought it was the manager, he never gave us his name. Long story short he wiggled stuff around, gassed it a bit. And boom it worked. By the time I got home my food was luckily still warm, 

Thumbs up to pf changs for the amazing help, I would have been stuck without you because AAA wait time was one hour and my husband was 40 minutes away."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. My sea bass was dry and by the time I got my to go and got home it was ice cold...ordered rice on the side inedible...not the PF Changs that I am used too"}
{"text":"This night was a packed house. It was a Tuesday and we were expecting it to be light but people were waiting outside. thank goodness it was only 2 of us. We had the wonton soup....tasted good. For entree we had the fried rice an mongolian beef. That was great. Now the rice.....humm missing some seasoning this time. The waitress was good. She was a little slow but no biggie. Maybe she had just came off lunch break. We told her about the rice being bland. She had one of the best chefs make us another order to take with us. That was nice. It was good too. We will return...it just depends on the day of the week. It won't be on a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Have to give one star to post, that's the only reason they are getting it. Went to dinner 6/4 , our server seemed to be having some issues with other staff, but did his best to keep upbeat while helping us. Our bill came to $ 54.00 and change. He gave us our bill, we generously tipped and left. To our surprise we receive an alert from our bank that we were overdraft. The server had used our card for another persons bill of over $ 250.00 ! Then ran our bill ! NEVER did he mention this to us, as he should have ! I'm of the belief that mistakes happen, but you fess up !! If he had told us about this we could have adjusted our $$ Now we have a $ 45.00 overdraft fee in addition to our meal which was not much more then the fee. 

We called as soon as we got the alert and spoke to a young lady, who said she was the Asst Manager. She said that she could not resolve because of the time of night and would leave a note for the day manager to call us.


** 6/5 Update ** I wish to thank the Chang day manager for his attention to this matter. He called a few hours after this posting. Along with his sincere apology, Chang is paying us back for the fees incurred in this error. After some extra hustle on our part the matter seems to be resolved. Thank you ! 

I am upgrading Chang to 4 stars due to the day mangers response to this issue. I am however being selfish and keeping one star for us because of the extra legwork we had to do on what was a rare night out."}
{"text":"Excellent service and friendly had a great time for a party of five. The food was good and served in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I don't know... PF Chang's just doesn't do it for me. I love Asian food but I've had better at hole in the wall restaurants than I've had at PF Chang's. The pricing is a bit high, but I understand because it is a nicer atmosphere. People rave about their lemon chicken but I think it's a bit average. I don't know... I just don't get the hype.

My coworkers and I went to this location for a dinner meeting and were sat in a very nice, private room. They only left 1 server to deal with all 20 with us, so both food and drink service was very slow. Orders were forgotten and it took over 3 hours for us to eat."}
{"text":"Been a couple of times had both bad and good. Tonight the wife and I had an early dinner around 5:30.  The place was almost empty but like I said we went early.  

I had the shrimp and lobster taco appetizer which was on the menu for 10.95 for three our waitress stated that I wanted 4 since it was my dinner I said sure but the last time I had them the waiter advised me of a hot pepper that was on the taco and since I'm not a fan of hot he had them made without the pepper. My waitress tonight said there was nothing hot or spicy on the taco. Then she came back to tell me they were out of shrimp and lobster so I couldn't have my tacos. My wife had ordered street noodles with shrimp so she asked about her dish the waitress stuttered a little then said she was sure they were out of lobster but they did have shrimp. I asked her for the tacos without the lobster and she was good with that. A few minutes later she came back to the table and said they now have lobster for my tacos. She brought three tacos and went back to order my fourth. The first bite I took my mouth lit up. The peppers were hot why didn't she know this when she said that was one of her favorites. Not a good night. One more little thing the 3 tacos on the menu were 10.95 add a fourth and their 14.00 just so you know."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly greeted and seated by the hostess.  She placed our utensils rolled in a black cloth napkin.  The napkin was DIRTY ...i opted for another.
My guest ordered a bowl and I had an Asian salad with chicken.  Our entrees arrived.  There was only about 5 bites of chicken in the salad, but it was very tasty.
We had to ask for refills of our drinks.   Our server brought new glasses full of Ice tea.  As he set one down he spilled the entire glass on the table...ok, accidents happen....BUT he left the mess...ice and drink running all over our table..dripping in the floor while he left to take care of another table.  Was there not someone bussing tables. Server stopped by our table and says, \"I'll get a towel\" it took several minutes for our table to get wiped down...he took the towel with his foot and tried to wipe the floor. We were soaked...no apologies."}
{"text":"The food and service was impeccable!...my server paolo was very polite and vivacious! I look forward to coming back very soon thank you."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely fantastic/crave-worthy. Flavorful, not over-sauced, good portions, etc. The salt and pepper calamari is wonderful (especially the dipping sauce!) as well as the Mongolian beef. Unfortunately, the service at this location is really hit-or-miss...usually a miss. Lots of empty drinks, long waits and attitudes. The waterfront location, although always super busy, has much better odds for good service and is worth a visit for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was very  good....best I have had for the several years I have been eating there....the waiter was very attentive.....had a booth in the back of restaurant which was great because it was very busy and loud.....really prefer a quieter place to eat"}
{"text":"I don't get why this restaurant has only 3.5 rating.

There is only one negativ thing to say
-we had to wait 15 minutes to order the first time (but it was really crowded)

Otherwise. The food is so good, i ate here twice in two days. Can recommend the sushi (fish almost melts in your mouth, sooo delicious) and the crispy honey chicken.
The stuff is very friendly and attentive, they give you drink and rice refills.
The prices are great for a location like this, also the ambiente looks like a high class restaurant. 

If you're looking for a nice romantic place who won't ruin you, try it!"}
{"text":"After another lunch meeting that I didn't quite have the gumption to suggest be moved, I figured it is time to finally review this place.  

Once upon a time, I was a poor college student who ate at cheap places, but loved \"gourmet\" food.  P. F. Chang's somehow built a reputation, albeit hardly deserved, of offering high quality \"gourmet\" Chinese food.  So, naturally, I decided that I wanted to try P. F. Chang's.

One evening before I graduated, the team decided to celebrate our impending freedom from Michael Crow's tuitionary grasp by dining at the P.F. Chang's across the street.  I don't recall what I had, but I think it was a Singapore Chow Fun (or something to that effect).  It was...passable I guess, but it cost $15, and wasn't even close to being as good as the Singapore Chow Fun I've had at Chinese take-out places in New York, and it cost over twice as much.  This poor college student could tell right off hand that this place is incredibly overrated (its average 3-star review is still too generous).

Fast forward a few weeks, and I'm in Houston for a job training regime.  The group decides to hit up P.F. Chang's for dinner.  I figured, since the company is reimbursing, I might as well give it another shot.  The appetizers were the best part of my meal, and the rest... well, it was the same drab, flavorless ennui we have all grown to expect from this place.

Then, of course, there was our lunch last week (once again, I didn't pay.  P.F. Chang's now occupies an important spot on my list of places I would never pay to eat at).  I had the honey garlic chicken, which didn't taste honey, garlic, or anything else besides deep fried chunks of chicken dipped in a lame sweet and sour type sauce.  I only ate half of it, which is worth mentioning, if you knew me at all.

And don't get me started on those lettuce wraps.  Those are the most overrated dish in the history of corporate faux-ethnic cuisine.

The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because their less expensive offering, Pei Wei, manages to be EVEN WORSE!  I swear, Pei Wei has only one sauce, whether you buy the Thai or General Tso's.  Do yourself a favor and just stick with your local neighborhood Chinese take-out place.  You'll get better food for a lower price."}
{"text":"Recently ate here for a niece's graduation.  They were able to accommodate our party of 16 and did a good job of quick service and delicious food.  They even assisted us with serving our own cake we brought for the celebration.  This is a great location just off the strip and sitting out on the patio (when it's not too hot) offers a nice view of the strip at night.  I recommend doing family style meals where you order lots of dishes and everyone helps themselves.  I've also been at this restaurant for many lunches as I work nearby.  Sometimes lunchtime service is a little slow, but overall, service at this restaurant has always been 4 or 5 star.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"PF Chang's is the Safety Sam of the restaurant world.  McDonald's serving up lettuce wraps in a warm, chic, urbane setting.

Let's be clear, I've yet to experience lettuce wraps anywhere that are even half as good as Chang's.  But like the Trojan horse predominately placed at the entrance of many of their locations, they seem to be a one-trick pony.

The menu is safe and bland. The food equally bland.  Complete disclosure, I like my food exciting, flavorful, and very spicy.  It should challenge me with layers of flavor profiles and you won't experience that at Chang's.  This is your Father's Oldsmobile, safe at 55 mph and 25 mpg.  I'm looking for a Roadster four inches off the ground that will make my eyes water and heart race.

The service was excellent, very attentive and helpful.  The food was presented nicely although the tables are a little small for family style serving.

Overall, nice evening with excellent company and adequate food but there's a reason you can't buy an Oldsmobile anymore.  Just sayin. . ."}
{"text":"It's hard to put my finger on it, but this location has a different feel that the location at home. A bit more rushed at times, perhaps. After walking around for several hours, we chose this place to grab a drink and a snack before heading back to the gambling. They have a great happy hour. We were able to sit outside and people watch. No complaints about the service."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night date night with the wife.  We were there during prime busy hours but it wasn't too busy.  We were seated in a nice booth for snuggling up right away.  We ordered drinks from the bar and they were decent.  My wife's sangria didn't fill the glass on both orders that she made.  We let that go! Delicious food.  Decent service.  I'm sure we will go again."}
{"text":"One of my regular stops in Scottsdale...PF Chang's always satisfies. Service is prompt, efficient and helpful. 

Valentine's Day lunch today, included Chang's Spicy Sweet and Sour soup, accompanied with Chang's Spicy Chicken. My server asked me if we'd prefer chop sticks, I replied: \" No thank you, we're Norwegian\". 

Located on the corner of Scottsdale Road and Camelback, PF Chang's gets the job done, even on a cool, wet, rainey day in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Most of PF Chang's food dishes are very good. We've been going here since Chang's was created, maybe for the past 24 years. 

Normally my favorite is Chang's Spicy Chicken, and my husband's is Orange Peel Chicken. Our daughter loves the kid's lo mein. 

Once in a while I deviate, but sometimes I'm disappointed. Tonight I ordered the Lobster Sushi roll. It was the blandest sushi roll I've ever eaten in my life. Just no flavor at all. It was like eating chunks of rice. Even their wasabi and ginger are bland. I guess an Americanized Chinese food place doesn't know how to make Japanese sushi. 

Another disappointing meal I've had here in recent months was the filet mignon dish - I think it was a stir fry. The meat wasn't good. It may as well have been flank steak. 

There are other wonderful mainstay dishes on their menu, such as buddha's feast, fried rice, all the chicken dishes, pan fried pork dumplings and Dan Dan Noodles."}
{"text":"I almost forgot how delicious , 
This Chinese food really is!!! Kung pao chicken plate was huge!!!
place was slammed , but service was good ~ worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Braised/broiled Chilean sea bass ... seasoned with oolong tea on a bed of fresh spinach...OMGood! A great taste combination!"}
{"text":"We've loved PF Changs, Been going since they were only located on Paradise. Then they opened in Green Valley. We've been to the this location several times and it never disappointed  us. Went tonight so excited only to find that it seems they've changed recipes or vendors.. The food was so different, it didn't taste the same at all. Not even close. So sad, we will never go back.  The service was wonderful, and atmosphere fabulous. Go back to what you guys were doing."}
{"text":"Went here with 7 demanding girls (lol). Lawerence was our server. He was AWESOME. On top of his game for sure. His memory was amazing! Our drinks were always full. He was fun and energetic. The food was also great. Everything was fantastic. Highly recommend him if you come here with a big group and want to have fun."}
{"text":"We go here every year when we are in town for a conference. Yesterday was our visit and it was a great one. We walked in and were able to get seated right away. It was 5:30 so it hadn't started to get crowded yet.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. It was happy hour so we got a few drinks and the tuna rolls. All was great. We ordered the changs for two special and both got egg drop soup which is fabulous. We then got the chicken lettuce wraps, they never disappoint. For our dinners we shared the changs spicy chicken and kung pao scallops. Both were prepared perfectly. The amount of scallops you get is amazing and they are cooked perfect. For dessert we got the banana wontons, he said they were great, I didn't have any due to my cinnamon allergy. What a great experience, we will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place until a friend suggested we try it. I liked it. But make sure you make a reservation (call in early afternoon for an evening reservation) and still expect to wait 15 - 30 mins when you arrive (they always tell people 10 mins but it takes about 30 mins - just go outside and people watch). I ordered off the Gluten free menu and the food was fantastic.  Service was friendly. It's not expensive which in Vegas is a rare find and why I give it 4 stars (for value)."}
{"text":"You can read Rick R's review as I was his friend with the lukewarm Spicy Chicken that came to the table far too late...however my observations also extend a bit further...at the bar it took ten minutes to get a drink...with only the diners at the bar with no line...the bartender, when pouring the draft beer put the tap head into the beer...a major blunder for someone serving beer. You have old beer from the last drink you served dried out on the tap that gets dunked into the new beer, thus affecting the taste....that is uncalled for in a supposedly upscale place. I go to Vegas often and will not be revisiting this place."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but my experience at this particular P.F. Chang's was awesome! My family decided to have my birthday dinner here the other night and my server Tyler honestly did amazing! Tyler was easily one of the best servers I've ever had at a restaurant! The food is always on point at this location also! Thanks again for the great birthday dinner! Keep up the great hospitality!"}
{"text":"very good reasonably priced. i like the combo friend rice and the hot sacuse on it, also the steamed dumplings!"}
{"text":"I think we're all a product of our environment.  My family was never really a \"take-out\" family.  Mom's version of take out was a Totinos pizza with those nasty little pepperoni pellets, remember those?  Every once in a great while I get a craving for one knowing fully I'm going to be disappointed-kind of like eating Dominos pizza after a couple of years.

Being in retail my entire life, I'm always impressed by good customer service. However, I try not to allow either good or bad service sway my Yelp reviews much either way, just focus on the food and in some cases, the ambiance.  The Princess texted me at work and said I was in charge of dinner for this particular Friday night.  Ok, I know she occasionally likes take-out Chinese (Flo's or since PF Changs is on the way home, that's a little easier).  PFC does a superficial great job of customer service.  They answer the phone by asking immediately is this Scott? Cool, right?  Who doesn't like to hear the sound of their name? Great job of taking the order, repeating it back to me, giving me the exact time I can pick it up, perfect!  I show up at the expected time, order is ready, kid at the take out podium announces everything I ordered, excellent, I leave a nice gratuity, grab my bag of chow and go home to surprise the Princess.

Surprise indeed.  Despite the quasi-six sigma approach to fulfilling my order, they forgot the rice. They forgot the Rice.  They forgot the effing RICE!  If you're going to New York City, you don't stop in Chicago! I wanted the rice, I needed the rice, the meal was not the same without the rice-and I paid for the rice! I pride myself on showing as much grace as I'd like to receive so I didn't call and throw a fit or drive the two miles back and get the rice, but let's just say that after a long week and wanting a nice dinner with The P, I wasn't happy.

Chang's flavor profiles are average to begin with, they really need to be served on a bed of rice, preferably with an extra kick of sriacha and/or hot peppers.  The chicken lettuce wraps are legendary but the rest of the meal wouldn't have even prompted me to write a review as it was completely unmemorable and would never have triggered a craving later in life, except one that might have to do with not having rice.

PFC?  Nah, next time I'll stop at KFC, get some hot chicken strips, make some rice at home, sauté some peppers and onions, have some whiskey & cinnamon simple syrup- take a picture of the masterpiece and put it on Instagram with the hashtag KFC-over-PFC (Yelp wouldn't allow the greater than symbol)"}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Not overly impressed.  Not sure why everyone loves this place.  I would rather eat at a smaller Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the food of pfchang.. However personally i feel the quantity is little less for what is getting paid.. Ordered kung pao chicken, garlic noodles.. Dynamite shrimp is absolute fav"}
{"text":"This location always nails it!

Was there on Sunday and was very crowded around 6.....was taken to a booth after about 25 minutes.

Had sweet sour chicken, almond/cashew chicken, and beef lo mein....all delicious!

Mai tais were perfect and  a bargain for a casino bar ($6) and the waiter we had was the best!   Dave, I think, was his name!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple times already. It's a cool setting with low lights & candles in the evening. But u can barely see ur food. They do have happy hour 3-6pm m-Thursday or Friday. My favorite is the Lo-mein with combo (chicken, beef & pork), you can add shrimp it's no additional cost. They have sushi and I heard the California rolls are the best. I'm not a sushi person so I don't know. It's a good Chinese please you should try it out. The spring rolls are okay they are like Panda Express. The portions are pretty big you can share. 

Sign up for emails to get deals."}
{"text":"Went there today to have my birthday lunch, it was about 1:45 so the place was not crowded AT ALL. Got seated not far from the hostess station and sat for close to 15 mins without anyone coming to the table, no water, nothing. The table next to us who got seated after us had a server and water by the time we left. Got up to leave and the hostess said \"is everything OK\" I said \"no, no one ever came over\"and we went to Bravo and had a great lunch! I like PF Chang's in general but if the 2 hostesses watched us sit there for 15 mins I have no idea why they didn't do something. I won't be going back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent beef with pepper and onions. Waiter made a good wine choice. Fastest food delivery, less than 5 minutes, honest. Both meals less than $30, in and out in 45 minutes."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.  Been here 5-6 times now.  Happy hour great.  Recommendations from me that are out of mist people's wheel house:  crispy green beans are like crack cocain, and the Ahi tuna is spectacular!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best service I have ever had!  Ryan, our waiter, was awesome!  He was prompt, polite and very professional.  Food, drinks and other staff were also great!"}
{"text":"Parking is free here at Planet Hollywood. Service is a bit slow. Food is good. We have sat in the regular eating area and the giant room in the back since we were a lot of people. The room in the back is nice and private. The regular eating area is fine too, you can see the strip and people as well as costumed people walk down the strip. The BBQ ribs are so good! The sauce is like yess!! Other stuff is ok. The vip room is awesome! You pay a higher percent for tip but they have good deals for big groups. They brought out a ton of food and kept bringing more until everyone was full for the price they told us in the beginning. You also get lots of attention from the workers. Very nice best experience."}
{"text":"I've loved PF Chang's since it opened years ago in Milwaukee but I feel like as time has gone by the portions have gotten smaller and the prices have gone up. 

The Chicken Lettuce Wraps are still delicious and reasonably priced. The lettuce wraps also take out well. If you do take out the lettuce wraps, opt to have the rice sticks on the side and not in the main dish otherwise they absorb the steam and lose their crunch. 

The fried green bean appetizer is also delicious but I would suggest not to get this appetizer via take out because they get soggy in the container.

The Mongolian beef is the best I have ever had but the serving size is very small for the $16.95 cost.

Overall, if you love lettuce wraps I would suggest going just for those!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, service was amazing! Super fast and friendly! The waiter comped all of our drinks!"}
{"text":"Too often we forget that P.F. Chang offers a take out menu. Talk about perfect for New Year's Eve I entered the order on line; when I walked in five minutes early it was ready. In and out in less that five minutes. M went for her favorite - sweet & sour chicken. I tried a new preparation of salmon  
The orders were so ample that we'll finish them for lunch today."}
{"text":"Vegetarian Lettuce Wraps was delicious! 

I was impressed with the gluten free menu offered.  I had the vegetarian Buddha's feast. I was expecting yummy sauce over the stir fried vegetables, instead it was just a plain plate full of steamed vegetables, broccoli, snow peas, asparagus and carrots. I had to put my own soy sauce and other sauce to make it tasty. It wasn't bad, but the menu was misleading which I didn't like. It should have been noted that the gluten free dish was going to be steamed vegetables.  

Kind of disappointing..."}
{"text":"In an effort to give this place one more try for a quick lunch, we were AGAIN disappointed!! We had a server who, as our receipt reads (we wouldn't know her name otherwise as she spent very little time with us and didn't let us know her name) goes by Adrian. She treated us like we were 'an afterthought' and again, I was sorely disappointed as we watched substantially larger tables around us get their food prior to us! What is even worse, we ONLY ordered 3 items; 2 from the app menu and 1 from the lunch menu! I will spare you the long details however, she paid us no attention, while we watched her give other tables a smiling face and the attention we had only hoped to receive! 

We are not picky, rude, or unreasonable; we only expect to be treated as a guest of the establishment. Overall, we spent AN HOUR AND HALF total here today!! For ONLY 3 items!! They weren't large, difficult, just simple items! How sad!! I wouldn't recommend this place at all! If you are in a hurry, this isn't the place for you! If you want to be treated like an outsider, then go on in! Its super sad to see people around you getting smiles and kindness why you get none of that! We even had to chase our server Adrian down to get the actual bill!! She brought us a piece of paper which merely showed we had to pay 34.50 with no details on it!! After watching her socialize with other staff and go to other tables (I understand servers assist more than one table at a time) she didn't even bring us the bill herself! She had the manager bring the bill; the same manager I wrote about on my last review who this time, was very kind as she had to bring us our lunch as well as this bill! Did I mention that? We had to ask the manager for our lunch finally and she went and got it? So, the up side is the manager that I had a terrible experience with last time, was kind today as she could clearly see we were still being very patient and not receiving the service we should. She offered us tea or something for the road which we politely declined as we did not want to sit around any longer. 

* I did email the woman who responded to my last review of this location as I have now had time, and look forward to what she has to say as I have never been so disappointed in an establishment!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love PF Changs I've only been here once and the service was incredible. Our waiter was extremely helpful in recommending stuff. I got the chef's special and it was to die for the ingredients were fresh and I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour.  Just beat the Friday night rush. Happy hour menu had a good selection, little slow out of the kitchen. Service at the bar slow as well. Perhaps a little understaffed. Food and drinks were good. Nothing special, but above average. Lots of places to choose from in the area, this is one of the more consistent restaurants."}
{"text":"We went to P.F. Chang's to celebrate my daughter's graduation. The restaurant was clean, the food was fresh and delicious and the service was excellent. Our waitress Kirsten was wonderful! She was very friendly and attentive. She made my daughter feel special on her graduation day!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst \"Chinese\" food I've EVER had! If I could avoid giving one star, I would. They are not even on the chart. Have never been a fan of PF Changs, as I remember it being extremely salty. Oh boy, they definitely surprised me and not in a good way. The chicken was dry (day old probably), beef with broccoli was drenched in sauce and orange chicken looked just strange...the spring rolls were thick and flavorless! I can go on and on...."}
{"text":"This is really close to my husbands school, I usually eat here while he is in class and then bring him food. The servers are wonderful and the lettuce wraps are extremely delicious. The ac is on very high and no way to turn it down so prepare to wear your jacket burrrr. but besides that, Ohio really knows how to cook when you actually find good places to eat, I usually dont eat at \"asian\" places but pretty tasty here :) yum"}
{"text":"In the past the food has been good but not great. Today was an all time low. Today I ordered the Chinese chicken salad. The won tons strips tasted like shrimp, they were likely fried in the same grease. The lettuce was wilted, the chicken was grilled but paper thin and half was dry. I ordered a cup of egg drop soup, it smelled like shrimp. We threw it away. Thankfully my family all ordered chicken entrees which were \"good\".  Pick up Stix is better. Too bad Vegas doesn't have one."}
{"text":"Guys!!! this is the most under appreciated restaurant! My boyfriend and I went to the Phillips place location to celebrate my mother's 50th birthday, and let me tell you they did not disappoint! Yes they have changed their menu since the last time we came but it also means that is has gotten better! We ordered a mountain of food, from shrimp vegetable rice to Kung pao shrimp, both chicken and shrimp lo mein, and a couple more I can't think of at the top of my head. Not only was the food delicious but our waiter was extremely kind. He took his time explaining the menu and which items he reccomend. He even offered to take our group picture! This restaurant gives you great service and even better quality. We will definitely be back! Especially because that kung pao shrimp was to die for!!"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour around 930. Hostess was looking down, wasn't initially acknowledged, but greeted us nicely after passing. Waited and had to ask to be helped. Bartender was super nice and apologetic for not seeing us. He was doing what us in the industry call sidework. Ordered drinks and food right away, mahi mahi taco's were unbelievably awesome! Ended up chatting and befriending bartender(s) had a great over all experience:)"}
{"text":"We sat outside and the area was absolutely filthy. They obviously don't clean the patio regularly, there is no way.
We started with soup and it was super thick and flavorless. Fortunately, the rest of our meal was ok. We will not return to this PF Changs"}
{"text":"I love chang's spicy chicken!!!!! ( I ask them to make it extra spicy).  We come here with family whenever they're in town and we never have problems even though we have a big group.  Big groups are the way to go at this place!  That way everyone can order something different and you can try lots of things...everything is good."}
{"text":"Service is fabulous and so was the food. We came back two nights in a row and they did not disappoint. The waiters and waitresses are super nice and helpful. They made us feel welcomed, every time. Excellent service. Noodle Bar servers should take a class from here. They are proud of what they do. 

The food was great. Every single dish was well taken care of. They tasted great and beautifully presented."}
{"text":"Service in the afternoon was horrible.  The table we sat in was not ideal.  The blinds did not block the sun and we were eating with the sun in our eyes.  There were no other tables available for a party of 8.  The food was alright.  We had to request for drink refills several times and the server was not responsive."}
{"text":"I seriously don't know why people love this place so much, the food here is horrible. The rice is never cooked properly.. And it's not even Asian food. It's fake asian food. I never come here anymore."}
{"text":"Grossly overpriced, sparse portions with flat flavors, minimal effort, and misleading menu descriptions. When the bill came, I was quietly furious. When you leave, they give you \"promotional meal vouchers\", like they know they suck and they're trying to backtrack. Never going back."}
{"text":"My brother and I ate here last night! My family loves this location! The staff is always friendly and the food is always on point! We especially love the young man Brandon we had last night. He mad some great recommendations and was very attentive to our needs even though the was only one other table out on the patio! Ask for Brandon and tip him accordingly, he deserves it!! Thanks again Happy Valley P.F. Changs!"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife  yesterday and we ordered that meal for 2 which comes with a soup,  1 appetizer  and 2 entrees for $42.   Not a bad deal.    I ordered the Mongolian beef which I really enjoy but after we ordered they came back and told us they were out of the beef.  It was the end of the night and we were literally the last to be seated FYI they seat till 10 which is closing. They tried accomadating us by giving us whatever entree we want but they said they did not have sliced beef or chicken leaving us with all fried shit.  I like fried shit  but too much fried shit makes me feel like shit.  Then comes diaherea shit and that's a shitty  situation.    The waiter was nice but the fried shrimp and fried chicken was too much.  A for effort but the food was lousy."}
{"text":"We have had 2 excellent dinners here. The Mongolian beef is great and so have all the other dishes we have tried. Our server Torey made our dining experience a pleasure. He had a great personality and was very upbeat and helped us with suggestions on appetizer and food choices. He was quick to keep our drinks full and very attentive to us and always willing to please us. We have come to enjoy this restaurant very much and will be an ongoing customer. Keep up the great food and customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an impromptu dinner & honestly from service to food everything except one dish was 5-stars. I haven't dined at Chang's in a very long time & their HH menu is pretty solid. Chicken lettuce wraps ($6) glass of decent wine $6 (big pour) lot's to choose from. HH is M-F 4-7pm. If you want a classic. Old school flare & your in the neighborhood, I highly recommend  this location. Comfortable, friendly, efficient & professional."}
{"text":"My hubby & I had a very long day, we were in the area & decided to give this spot a try. It was around 6ish & they weren't very busy so we figured we'd be able to order quick & make our way home. We were sat quickly as the restaurant wasn't packed & our server KIM took our drink order, after they arrived we quickly placed the rest of our order which we decided on chicken satay, a cup of wonton soup, some calamari & our entrees of sweet & sour chicken for my hubby & shrimp pad thai for myself. We got our apps in a timely manner from food runners other than our server, who mind you KIM only had 2 other tables, a 2 top of a mother with her teenage daughter, then one other table of a young couple with their 2 yr old!! My point she wasn't busy at all, do you think she bothered to at least one time ask if our food was satisfactory, no don't think so & not even when she swung by to grab a couple dirty plates. At this time is when we were realizing yes we ended up with an ignorant server who was unfortunately racially profiling us because I couldn't count how many times she was chatting it up with the other tables making sure that they were fine but she failed to realize I was once a server & I will tip a server well over 20% for excellent service!! We were then served our meals by yes you guessed it anyone but the infamous KIM & once I did the one twirl of my pad thai with a piece of meat I bit into no not a piece of shrimp but breaded chicken!! Thank you KIM for not listening to our order & for graciously never once even saying boo to us, yes I know there aren't many blacks in your neck of the woods but we are also paying customers & if you look at my profile you will see we like to try many different places from 1 star to 4 stars & yet that was the WORST SERVICE BY KIM that we've had since relocating from Miami to the Phoenix area. I definitely did not think twice about giving KIM a zero tip & if I could give this establishment zero stars I would do so also but since I can't we'll just never step foot beyond their four walls!!"}
{"text":"First time at PF Chang's in years. Tuesday evening and the place was still 1/3 full-good sign. My wife and I were seated in five minutes and we were quickly greeted. 

Our server, Zachary, offered us drinks and went thru the seasonal menu. We ordered from the gluten free menu, so we couldn't take him up on any specials, since none of them were GF. 

My wife ordered a glass of wine and I got a pot of Dragon Eye Oolong tea. The drinks were served in 7 minutes. The tea was rather spectacular. Good herbal notes with a definite citrus finish. 

We had also ordered Chang's signature appetizer: lettuce cups. Tasty marinated chicken, water chestnuts and green onions served over crispy rice noodles and a side of lettuce. Delicious. 

Our entrees arrived after 15 more minutes. My bride of 30 years ordered the GF Singapore Street Noodles while I ordered a cup of Hot and Sour Soup (not GF) and GF Chang's Spicy Chicken. The noodles were better than ordinary chow mien: the noodles were pan-fried, giving them great texture. There were plenty of shrimps and chicken pieces. The Spicy Chicken was their version of General's Chicken. Not as crunchy as GC but very good. A bit sweet so I just added Sriracha to it. 

Zachary did an outstanding job keeping the table clean and his guests happy. Our dinner totaled $53 before tip. 

We will he returning."}
{"text":"First time at this P F Chang's. My wife and I arrived around 7 pm on a Wednesday and it was pretty empty. Lots of neighboring restaurants were really full we noticed but due to food allergies, we are always limited in choices at other establishments. 

Chang's offers a gluten free menu that doesn't just eliminate pieces of your meal. They took the time to create some true gluten free options and craft them in a separate area of the kitchen. 

My wife ordered the Pad Thai and a glass of wine while I ordered 4 potstickers (not gluten free) Chang's gluten free Spicy Chicken and just a lemon water. 

The food was up to Chang's expected level of quality. The service was so-so. She just wasn't really engaged in her work, even tho she only had two parties. 

All in all, a good meal tho."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today with my niece, mom and baby nephew and had the best time. Our server Scott was super friendly, upbeat and helpful. He brought some fruit with our drinks right away to keep the little man at our table happy and anything else we requested was delivered in a prompt and efficient manner. We never once had to ask for refills, he was always there to fill the waters as soon as he saw they were getting low. I'd definitely come back and ask for his station if I weren't visiting from out of town. Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order take out at least 2 times a month. He always ventures out and tries new things. Mongolian Beef and pineapple cocoanut ice cream(2 scoops) for me EVERY single time.  Never fails"}
{"text":"Talk about the ultimate chinese torture: arriving with the crowds at 6pm with a party of 10 on one of the busiest weekends of the year: automatic 90 minute wait.   Freezing outside (unnaturally so) for Phoenix, and the door opening every 3 seconds with people sqeezing in/out.  Family wants to stay because of course every other place on any sort of main strip is going to be the same wait.  Finally sit: waiter looks 13 and wet behind the ears, seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown (running frantically, cursing under his breath), stops by after 10 minutes to let us know \"I will help you later, Im busy,\" meanwhile the kids have already eaten at Krispy Creame across the street or else they would be pissing all over the table, no room to even get out of your table except to go all the way to the back of the place since its packed so tight with people.  3 hours later, finishing up, no time or room for desert with mega-sized fried portions, escaping back out in the cold to go home and feel ill.  Is this worth the 300$ bill?  Is this what we call entertainment and family time?  At least the orange peel chicken was excellent, but after starving that long anything would taste like fried manna."}
{"text":"When I want to treat myself I go to Chang's for a late lunch since normal lunch or dinner is very crowded.  Wait staff have been pretty good considering I am not a big check (no party of 4-6).  There seems to be some variation from city to city with their entrees (I have eaten at Chang's in 5 cities) but for the most part all is very good.  I prefer the Hot and Sour Soup and Chang's spicy chicken."}
{"text":"Late night dinner at PF Chang's with friends in the City of Sin. We were not sure what time the restaurant closed, so we arrived at 11:45 pm and asked. They informed us they were closing in about fifteen minutes. Although they were closing soon, they still graciously served us. George, our waiter, was a pleasant delight. He was attentive throughout the meal. Our glasses were always filled with water and our silverware and dishes were clean. The food was served hot and nicely arranged. The Pad Thai had phenomenal flavor and the fried rice was delicious. The Sesame Chicken was flavorful too. Our large group had a fabulous time at P.F. Changs."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in such a long time. The last time I was at a PF Changs was in Honolulu. They have really good happy hour. In Hawaii my favorite drink here is the Aloha Kiss but they didn't have it at this location so I tried the Asian pear mojito. Very refreshing...I like mojitos and I like Asian pears so it's the perfect combo. I tried many different appetizers but my favorite are the fried green beans and fire dumplings."}
{"text":"For over 20 years, PF Changs has been one of our all time favorite restaurants. Excellent food, fabulous service. So WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? 

Last night.  We should have known something was amiss by the size of the crowd... THAT WASN'T THERE. We were seated immediately...YAY! Then we ordered our drinks, entrees & appetizer. And THAT'S when the trouble began.

It took 30 minutes for the drinks (water) and appetizer to appear on our table...even though the restaurant was filled to 25% capacity. We let that slide. Wish I could tell you how LONG it took for the main course to arrive....but after waiting ANOTHER 45 MINUTES (not ONCE did our server stop by to check on us, explain the delay, NOTHING)...we asked for the check and, after paying for the Dynamite Shrimp, we walked out. No tip. Again, our server said ABSOLUTELY  NOTHING. 

WE. HAVE. NEVER. WALKED. OUT. FROM. ANY. RESTAURANT. EVER.

If I could give this restaurant less than 1 star, I would. I hope this particular  PF Chang's is NOT representative of ALL. This was the absolute WORSE service we have ever experienced at ANY establishment. We will not be returning to the Charlotte Changs any time soon."}
{"text":"Awesome, as always.  My sister and I bribed my father into going by telling him we would buy lunch for the 4 of us if we could eat lunch there.  He is not a Chinese fan but he enjoyed lunch too.  Great waiter, good food."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's has been around forever. They have good lunch specials that give you the option to eat healthy choosing between brown or white rice. The bartenders are always very attentive. Between that and the lunch specials it makes it easy for us to come in on our lunch break."}
{"text":"We have been to this location probably a dozen or so times in the past and I quite like the food but sometimes the experience suffers because the service failed.

Not today, came in for lunch on a Sunday around 1120am, and it was great, actually had 2 gift cards given to us by the manager from the last lunch where the entire thing flopped.

But today not only were the food great but also the service, the added dishes for the Chinese NY were awesome.

Zero complaints."}
{"text":"Letttuce wrap, and hot and sour soup was good. My Vietnamese crab salad was neither Vietnamese nor a salad. It was cold stale noodles with hardly noticable crab, spinkles of fruit and no sauce, yet it was almost the highest priced lunch item. A restaurant with real vietnamese food wouldn't be caught dead serving such fakery. Please take it off the menu. Worse than cafeteria food."}
{"text":"I had been here before, last year and it was delicious. It is just BETTER than other PF Chang's. I do not even go to the one a half mile from my local home.
We craved it for the whole year and made sure when in Vegas, we returned. 
We checked the balance of our reward cards and we were both able to get our meals at half off. You just tell the server how much cash you have on your card and they deduct it from the bill. To know that, you just visit the rewards desk inside the casino and ask, showing your card and ID.
I went for the orange peel shrimp and it did not disappoint. Tangy and delicious.
Service was fine.
Try and get a seat like we did on the upper level that gives a great view of all the beautiful people/drunks/crazies going by on the Strip. Last year, some alcohol-fueled idiot climbed atop the white huge horse statue out front and - you guessed it, he fell off. And his 'friends' left him there in a heap.
You will shake your head and smile through yummy bites, saying \"Only in Vegas!\""}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. PFC at its top form."}
{"text":"Ordered the for two meal - egg drop soup and steamed dumplings for starters, spicy tofu and garlic chicken for entrée and chocolate dumpling for dessert. Everything was tasty. Staff are friendly.  Service was acceptable - not too long but not very fast. I don't know how they are on other days coz we came in at 11am on a sunday. Place was not packed. Ambience is casual and family friendly yet yet good enough for a casual dinner date.

We'll come back if we are in the mood for a more pricy asian fusion."}
{"text":"The food was so good, the waiter was really nice and helpful. The restaurant was clean, I really liked the ambiance. 
We got: shrimp lo mein, chicken lo mein, sesame chicken, Kung pao chicken, vegetable fried rice, and an order of sushi, 3 waters, 1 sweet tea, 1 lemonade, and a cucumber blueberry crush cocktail. Which was around $92, it was so worth it though. We're definitely going back."}
{"text":"When I get a craving for rice, this is usually the place I head to. I do like the fact that they have a gluten free menu, with my go-to menu items being: chicken lettuce wraps, egg drop soup and the chicken fried rice. My fiancé and I have alway have good service here, with the waiters being very personable and accommodating to my fiancé's interesting sauce concoctions. 
They also have a good agave nectar margarita. It's just agave nectar, lime juice and tequila. Simple and without all the usual calories in a margarita."}
{"text":"Another business lunch but not as good results. I placed a very similar order but after unloading it all, we were missing all the chopsticks, mustard, soy sauce, hot chili, the soup and half the fortune cookies. 

It's always tough to impress at a business lunch when you are missing items since it looks like you don't know how to order. 

BTW, I had ordered three other times since my last review and they were perfect two of the three, with missing items the other time. Perhaps they have a careless person on the staff?"}
{"text":"Our experience here was really good.  Our server, Stacy, made the visit amazing, as she took extra care with our 1-year-old grandson.   Hubby had the Kung pao shrimp from the lunch menu and really enjoyed it.  I had a bite and it was quite tasty.  Our daughter had the lettuce wrapped chicken, and said it was yummy.  I really liked my jicama tacos, but wasn't thrilled that the lobster had breading on it.  The hot and sour soup was good, but not what you'd expect from typical hot and sour: this has a beef stock base, rather than chicken, so it isn't as light, but the flavor was good.  Grandson had the fried rice with chicken from the children's menu, and he totally enjoyed spreading it everywhere (thank you, Stacy, for your understanding).  Overall, a good meal."}
{"text":"Horrible, tasteless, bland, overpriced Chinese food. Both times I ate at this PF Chang's were terrible. Good thing both times were free or else I would be even more pissed. Also, need to do something about their slow service. I had ordered online for a pick-up several hours in advance. I still had to wait 15-20 minutes. 

You think they would at least make one of their signature dishes palatable. Wrong! Their chicken lettuce wraps was one of the worst meals I've had in Vegas!"}
{"text":"When I walked in the aroma of what was cooking hit me.  It smelled so good I knew I was going to like this place.  Service was quick and friendly. I had the Korean Stir Fried Chicken and wife had Miso Glazed Salmon.  Both were excellent tasting dishes.  Presentation was outstanding and serving size was just right. Price I thought was very reasonable.  One suggestion is to open up the dining area by removing some tables. I think this would improve the ambience and dining experience.  But that's just me."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the Mongolian Beef! I crave it! Lately I've been getting it with extra meat, no onion and adding asparagus and love it! You really can't go wrong with any menu item or beverage selection at P.F. Chang's!!"}
{"text":"Bad.  Will never come back.
Service was horrible.  Had to ask for refills and chopstick to eat.
Food not great.
Dessert awesome.  But we are here to eat dinner, not dessert ."}
{"text":"Not good.  Lettuce wraps were OK, Shrimp Tempura roll was dry, the miso salmon was over cooked, kung pau chicken was salty and the dessert looked like my 2 yr old nephew plated it.  The drinks were over priced and watered down.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Always good and tasty food. The atmosphere is clean and refreshing. The menu items are consistent and reliable. Have never had a bad meal over the years that  my family and I have been patrons."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at this Mesa, AZ location recently.  I enjoyed the Korean Spicy Chicken, Tempura-battered green beans, and Mango Iced Tea!  All were excellent and the service matched.  I won't hesitate visiting this establishment again!"}
{"text":"Great service. As busy as they were when we came, our server was very attentive and was very nice. One of the things I like about PFs is the consistency. Very convenient location too, right inside Planet Hollywood. If you are staying there you can go downstairs for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"twenty minutes after being seated and no word from anybody! not worth waiting for some crappy ass chinese food and same crappy ass service. And it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"I received excellent service at PF Chang's last night. In fact, I have to say that it was just about the best restaurant experience I have had in quite a while. Thanks to our server Mikey O.!"}
{"text":"So, not sure why the manager decided to tell me that this is how they always serve the Mongolian Beef, as my myriad prior dining experiences at this restaurant beg to differ. What's super funny is that I didn't want a replacement or compensation for this dish. All I wanted was to bring it to their attention so that the kitchen could get it together. And yet, Ms. Manager thought that trying to snow me was the way to handle this situation. My favorite part was that after she told me that this many scallions (it's seriously like someone went to the Giant Eagle next door, grabbed a handful of scallions, came back to the kitchen, and cut all of them directly into my plate... like, they weren't even sautéed) are ALWAYS included in this dish, she then said that she didn't see my plate before it went out of the kitchen. Which tells me that the scallion to beef ratio was, in fact, way off base. 

I'm not sure if this is supposed to be some bizarre cost-cutting measure or what, but how is a real live human expected to digest all of these? As you peruse my photos (I've included a picture of the dish from their website as well, for the sake of comparison), please keep in mind that I had already eaten a fair amount of said scallions.

This isn't really about scallions. It's about customer service and accountability. This restaurant evidently has neither. As a result, I won't be back. Which is sad because I love the chicken lettuce wraps and the Mongolian Beef, minus about 75% of the scallions I was served tonight."}
{"text":"Rude staff! Never going back, I contacted the CEO, waiting for a call back!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But never again. 
They really need to check the bartender and hostess. They are classless on how they choose to articulate themselves to paying customers."}
{"text":"We came here mostly because my cousin Leslie gave us a $50 Chang's gift card as our wedding present. I've always appreciated that this is one of the healthier restaurant chains.  There's a heavy emphasis on fresh veggies, but as long as it includes their NOTORIOUSLY addictive crispy green beans, I don't mind one bit.

So it's kind of strange that we actually didn't have the green beans on this trip. Probably because for me, at least, the Chicken Lettuce Wraps took precedence over everything. It's always been my go-to here to help me with my 'crunchy' fix. 

We also decided to chow down with Cecelia's Pork Dumplings, the Chicken AND the Pork Egg Rolls.  There were multiple orders of everything - yes, we (make that I) went a little nuts, but it wasn't a bad thing.  Paired with drinks, our \"app dinner\" was so satisfying, that we really didn't need dessert...I know that sounds like we had a choice, but we were so stuffed that we didn't.

The service was excellent as always. Not really a mystery why we hadn't been back in so long, since there are so many great places to eat in the Valley now, so that you never have to go to the Strip if you don't want to.

I'll need to leave a reminder for myself sometime, to come back to Chang's every few weeks, so I won't need the excuse of a gift card..."}
{"text":"Not really that good if I'm honest.

Very 'msg-ey' (make sense..?) - more mass catering than a specific restaurant experience.

I chose awfully badly in PF's defence, switching rice for quinoa (don't ask..) and as expected it didn't work, but should it have really been an option?

Dumplings arrived with cold pork filling and weren't finished (unheard of as we ALWAYS scoff the dim sum)

Hit it with low expectations and sadly lived up to it."}
{"text":"PF Changs is a perfect example of a mass chain restaurant that is decent in food and price. Easily comparable to the Cheesecake Factory, the quality is what you would expect. The decor is nicer than most chain restaurants and the food is slightly above average quality wise. My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and the beef and broccoli and both were relativity good. The portions are huge so be aware of that before you order. Most of their menu items are easily shareable. However, our waitstaff was slightly below great. We ordered white and brown rice, only to have 2 brown rices delivered. The waiter then informed us that he will bring the white rice, only to be seemingly forgotten. All in all, the restaurant was comparable to the Cheesecake Factory in every sense, with less than comparable service. Three stars."}
{"text":"My wife's company orders take-out occasionally for lunch and she always like it so we tried it for dinner tonight.  It's a nice place.  We were seated quickly.  However, those are really the only two strong points of PF Chang. 

We were planning to go to a movie after dinner, and figured that an hour and fifteen minutes should be plenty of time for dinner.  No, not at PF Chang. Our server took drink orders then disappeared for twenty minutes. Once he finally returned and took our dinner order, the food came fairly quickly.  We then made the mistake of asking for more rice.  He disappeared again for another twenty minutes.  Then it was twenty more minutes waiting for our bill. We ended up being late for the movie.

The food was okay, although my Szechuan beef was very salty. Everything is way over-priced compared to other--better--Chinese restaurants in the area.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm not really into chain restaurants but my mom's in town so.... You know. 

The mains are basically a half notch classier than a Chinese take out but I'm just not impressed. $15 for a small portion of orange chicken that is about as good as a cheap takeout seems silly. 

Where I think the restaurant really underwhelms is the soups and salads, I know it isn't the focus of the restaurant but the lunch sides that precede the lunch entrees are just bad. The salad lacks any creativity and the soup was just a bowl of salty beef water."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss when it comes to getting your food made correctly.  I would say the last 3 times I have eaten here, they have messed up my order, wow!  My husband does take out here often and they had the incorrect pick time even though he repeated it 3 times over the phone.  I think PF Chang's really needs to take a look at the company they use for call in orders.  I believe it's a 3rd party company that takes the phone orders.  

 I gave this location 4 stars because the service has always been stellar, besides the cooks making my food extra spicy instead of NOT spicy.  Its situated at Kierland, so you can take a nice stroll after you fill up on too much Pad Thai.  

Overall, I do enjoy coming here once and a while.  A major plus for me is they offer a dairy-free menu!!!  This makes it easy for me to pick and choose what I can eat.  Just ask your server and they will print if off for you.  I think the happy hour is great as well."}
{"text":"Utter overpriced garbage. The vegetables do taste fresh and the tofu actually has some taste but there is one problem with the few things I've had - they apparently have no idea what spices are. It has got to be the safest, most boring sodium laced food I've ever had. Ma-po tofu last time I checked was a spicy food, what I had was about as spicy as butter popcorn from the movie theater."}
{"text":"I've been to this Changs a bazillion times over the years. The food is always the same consistency but the service has been up and down over the years. I went yesterday with my group of girl friends for GNO and we had a blast. Our server, Memo (yes, that's his name) was excellent. He kept our drinks filled, handled all our quirky lady-crazy orders, and was friendly, upbeat, and helpful. The food is the same typical Changs food that you can get anywhere but the difference is the service. I hope that this Changs keeps up the good work because everyone needs a good go-to place. :)"}
{"text":"I went to P F Chang's for happy hour and ordered off the happy hour menu.  The crispy green beans (tempura green beans) were delicious and the dipping sauce was unique and a little addicting.  Then I tried the latest craze sweeping the nation according to the New York Times.  Asian Tacos.  I had the Korean Beef Tacos.  Two tacos per order.  Great tacos.  Very flavorful.  To drink I had the Jasmine Ice Tea which was refreshing.  I had a cocktail too, an Old Fashioned.  It was made really well.  I had to let the ice melt a little, very strong.  Every thing I ordered was off the happy hour menu.  The menu is a pretty good deal.   I will be back for those tacos.

P.S.  Our waiter was awesome and cute ; )"}
{"text":"Hands down best Chinese in town.  Meat is very good quality.  Most smaller Chinese restaurants I've been to the meat was chewy and fatty.  Can't beat this place."}
{"text":"Was in town for a conference...I ordered online, my order was screwed up 2 days in a row: The 1st night they completely forgot my brown rice. The 2nd night the green beans were burned beyond recognition...What's a girl to do...at home (Chicago), I've never had a bad experience with PFC's...Oh well, u can't win 'em all~"}
{"text":"Hostess was rude or just dumb. Other than that the service was ok. The food is not bad."}
{"text":"Ok. I see the negative reviews. Haters ! The Heck with you. The food is good and consistent. The service is great, especially justine in THE bar."}
{"text":"I usually wouldn't leave a review on major chain restaurants just because I don't really expect 5 star treatment or anything, but the service I had was ridiculous. We stopped by for a quick late lunch at around 4 pm on Wednesday afternoon. As we were walking towards the host stand, one of the two hostesses (she looked middle aged, dark hair), stared at us with her mouth hanging open and then said, \"can I help you.\" Asked for a table for two. \"Ummmmm, are you guys here for happy hour or no\" I say no, just lunch. She looked down for the rest of the conversation and said, \"K, this table here okay\" And points to the first booth closest to the host stand. We said sure, it was a nice table. \"K. Sit and I'll bring your menus in a sec\". We sat and a minute later, she brings our menus while looking at the bar area the whole time and walked away without saying a word. No \"enjoy your meal\", no \"enjoy\", nothing. Throughout our meal, she walked across our table talking loudly to the other employees, and once even yelling across the room to say something to a server right in front of our table. I didn't see a single smile or politeness from her to us or any other guests. 

I don't write reviews about the host stand because that doesn't make or break an experience for me, but she was so unprofessional and rude that I'm sorry, I was disgusted. 

Two stars for the always satisfying, good food and for Luis, our very friendly and professional server."}
{"text":"We've eaten at this PF Chang's on a few occasions when in Phoenix on business.   It's usually pretty busy, I assume since it's close to the ASU campus.  Food and service has always been as expected with this comfortable chain.  My favorite entrees are the garlic eggplant and the kung pao chicken.

On one occasion, the steamed dumplings that we ordered during dim sum happy hour were delivered cold.  Upon further inspection, they didn't appear to have been cooked.  The server quickly took them away and brought new ones, and the manager stopped by to tell us that they'd been comped.  During a busy period at the restaurant, it's easy for this to happen (particularly with steamed, which look about the same when cooked as when not cooked), so I appreciated that they handled the situation expeditiously and graciously. 

This location has great windows that look on to the main street.  They do have a patio, but either the street is too busy or the heat is too intense for it to be pleasant, so we always stick to eating indoors. There's parking in the deck nearby (they validate) or on the street if you're lucky enough to snag a spot.  

#Yelp365 - 195/365"}
{"text":"Good food, good service.

I always get the Ma Po Tofu and its really good. The first time I'd ever been to a PF Changs was at this location and the service was good. They got me and my boyfriend in on a night that looked a little busy and we were seated right away."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were seated at a table almost in the middle of the dining area when there were hardly any people there. The only people infact, were dining at booths (most in only groups of two). So, why did we get stuck where the world could see us even after we made it obvious a booth was preferred? I have no idea. Also, as more people eventually came in for dinner, they were all seated at open booths. I don't know, I just didn't like (nor do I ever) being in the middle of the room as the only people dining at a table. It was just strange.

The food was good and our actual waiter was decent enough. It's too expensive to go back considering the portions aren't worth the price. Also, this is more of a 2.5 star review...nothing great, not completely awful."}
{"text":"I never realized how much fat this place packs into their food until I really had to look.  For being Chinese, what the hell??  

It's nice that they have their nutritional values online, but so scary because then you realize what you're actually eating.

Tastes mighty great tho.

Service is ok at this location... it's been a hit or miss.  The prices are WAY too high."}
{"text":"PF Chang's delivered a great meal and quality service. Peter, the owner, came by and greeted me and my guest. He told me that we can park for free in the parking garage behind the restaurant with validation. I had no idea, but that's great to know for the future. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my orange chicken and my guest enjoyed his mandarin chicken, although for the price he would've preferred more chicken in his dish, even if it meant less veggies."}
{"text":"P.F. Changs a chain of Asian fusion restaurants across the globe.  They serve good chinese dishes over rice and lots of appetizers that are great to share.  A great place to go before the movies."}
{"text":"I hesitated to give this place one star.  I think it is just a sentimental thing.  I used to love this place. However, I must agree with many of the lesser reviews on here.  The food and service at this location have gone south, really south.

I went last night by myself for an early dinner since my spouse was out of town.  I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar or at a table and I asked for a table, not really in the mood for the bar scene.  They sat me at a little table in the bar right next to the bar/waiter station.  Not a great seat in the place considering there were only three or four other tables occupied in the entire restaurant when I arrived.

Next, I ordered some shrimp dumplings and some Street Noodles.  The dumplings were OK.  They really lacked for some sauce, so I tracked someone down for some hot mustard to add some kick.  This only helped some, so I thought that the lettuce wrap sauce would do the trick, but could never get a hold of anyone to get it for me.  The bartender who took my order became busy with his side-work and with his girlfriend who had happened into the bar.  

The street noodles weren't nearly as good as they sounded on the menu.  The noodles were kind of a dry/sticky combination of an odd curry mixture and there were green onions that were literally a whole stock with the ends cut off, then cut in half.  How am I supposed to eat that?

I only had water with lemon to drink.  The bartender gave me a glass with a very little and thin slice of lemon in it (not really meant for more than appearance).  When my glass was empty I had to flag him down for a refill and he summoned a bus boy to fill my water.  He grabbed a pitcher from a nearby ledge and proceeded to fill my glass with room temp water that melted the little ice I had remaining there and looked completely shocked when I requested a separate glass filled with ice.

Lastly, I just have to throw in a side note.  They have stopped preparing any dishes with sea scallops in them.  May seem a little like I am whining, but the kung-pao scallops and orange peel scallops were some of the best dishes I had ever experienced there.

Unfortunately, I think I am going to have to let this place go.  I desperately want for it to go back to the great restaurant with amazing food and even better service that I recall from only a few years ago."}
{"text":"As I write this I am still sitting here waiting for my check! My food has been done for almost 20 minutes yet, my rude waitress seems to careless!
Let me start from the beginning...I am a vegetarian and this menu is only for those who like tofu! I can tolerate tofu but, don't prefer it as a main source of meat replacement. Do the main chefs at PF Chang's not care about the vegetarian or vegan consumers or think we all love tofu?? I have news for them that this is not the case and the options on their menu suck!! 
When I did ask my ever so pleasant waitress about a vegetarian dish her response was about the same as I received upon her arrival to my table...a roll of the eyes and a \" I don't like tofu\". 
So, instead of helping me when I asked her what the dish was like I received her personal opinion. I ended up with the vegetarian lettuce wraps. I was informed we can't make the sauce at the table anymore so I ended up with a bland runny wrap sauce for my wraps!! Thank you again PF Chang's! So as I sit here I contemplate the rating to give and usually give 5 stars to those who deserve it yet, in this case I feel two is fair. You were not the worst but, have fallen far beyond your glory days and have a long way to go before I will walk through this door again."}
{"text":"Been to PF Changs many many times and their food is always good. I was at this location with a pretty large group, eight people, this week and we had a good experience. The waiter was very nice and although it was confusing for everyone, he helped us with splitting the checks. Some of the appetizers were a little on the slow side to come out and they were on top of it, Manager came out and comped the appetizers for us without us really needing to say anything. Surprisingly, they have one of the best moskow mules I've ever had."}
{"text":"PF Chang's has always been a favorite, but it had been YEARS since I have been back and able to make a dinner reservation. We did so for my birthday. And it was a very pleasant experience! 

They were very prompt in seating for a reservation. The service staff was on top of it and knew exactly what I was referencing when it came to my favorite dish that is no longer on the menu (but still served when requested). We really loved the new cocktails including raw, local honey! The mojito w/ cucumber & honey was outstanding. I would absolutely go back just for cocktails because of that gem of a drink! 

And when it comes to birthdays, they probably have the best, most unique free dessert! Banana stuffed wantons w/ cinnamon sprinkle & pineapple vanilla ice cream... SO good!!! Plus, they have a really good rewards program you can sign up to join for free. 

The only complaint we both had, was the bathrooms. Absolutely gross. That is the only reason I can't rate this a 5. I understand it gets busy on Friday and Saturday nights... but having to wade through toilet paper all over the floor, with \"water\" all over the floors & sink counters along with unflushed toilets was pretty gross and made us pull out our portable hand sanitizer even after washing our hands. Please clean & upkeep the bathrooms! 

But,love this chain, and this location had a great staff and good service! Thanks for making my birthday a very enjoyable evening!"}
{"text":"Out shopping yesterday I was tired, hungry and sniffily(sp?) so I decided some Changs Lettuce wraps and Wonton soup were in order for lunch. The first time I called it sounded like somebody hung up. I've cut people off too so no big deal. Called back and sat on hold for what felt like forever until a surly sounding guy took my order and told me 15 minutes. I go there expecting it to be busy and that was why the guy was crabby but it was probably only 1/3 full. I walk in and there is nobody up front, so I go to the bar and wait and 5 minutes-no bartender. I go back up front and find and ask the host about the bartender and she says he'll be back soon so I continue to wait at the bar, no bartender no nobody. Finally the guy comes back and asks me \"you have the soup right?\" Yeah I did. I reluctantly tipped him a couple bucks and headed home only to find super salty lettuce wrap filling- like buckets of salt on it- and sub-par soup. I just had this soup less than a week ago from the Changs at Kierland and it was awesome. This one had a few scrawny looking shrimp in it where it usually comes with big juicy thick shrimp. And something was off with the broth too, didnt taste right at all. I have loved this soup for years and this was the first time I have been disappointed. Oh well, I will just avoid this location in the future!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday night.  The hostess barely acknowledged us, the food was mediocre and way to expensive for the serving size.  The waitress, Rachel was the only saving grace for this experience.  She was kind, responsive, and personal.  Major downfall, my 2 year old daughter was charged for a full entree, all she had was some noodles (dry, no sauce) and a plain breast of chicken.  The cost for her meal $12.75.  Hardly reasonable.  The sushi was dry and the size of a nickel.  The soy sauce was WAY too salty and took away from the somewhat palatable taste of the food.  

Overall, not really worth the $50 tab (and we didn't even order any drinks, just had water).  Reminding me to stay away from the large corporate chains and continue to fill the pockets of small mom and pop businesses."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Took almost 15 minutes for our drinks and they were out of the appetizer we wanted.  Ordered what was supposed to be a vegetarian meal and it had chicken in it. Brought it to our servers attention and nothing was done. The waitress was incredibly rude from start to finish. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this P.F. Chang's on Tuesday night and have to say that is was terrible. Not only I was the food ready 45min later than the time frame they gave me over the phone, the food was soggy, underprepard and bland. For example, the Kung Pao Shrimp was not fried as it is supposed to be and doughy. My family always orders this dish in various locations and this was by far the worst. 

Delay and food preparations aside, what really sets me off is that I not only waited 45 min to receive my food (altogether the preparation time was well over 60min), I have received nothing from the management as an apology but plenty of negative attitude.

 Maybe I am spoiled but in every P.F. Changs I have been so far, I have received a credit on the bill or a voucher if something is off. This time I have received nothing (only a half hearted apology of the manager). 

in my opinion, if a customer waits 45min in the restaurant for a $110 pickup order made on the phone, prepays AND still gives $5 tip, I expect to get something off the bill. Here, however, I have received nothing.

I will not visit this restaurant anymore and cannot recommend it. Sadly it has lost its game - maybe it was the Tusday manager."}
{"text":"Chang's Spicy Chicken makes me go...Ding du du du ding ding ...nu nu nuh! Fan-freaking-tastic.
I love PF Changs...which we have renamed PF-Twang-Bangers...or PF Chizzle in Scotts-Dizzle.


I know how mature right....
Best way to go about it...

Big huge pot of tea- I like the OOLONG Dragon Eye
Calamari with the salt and pepper dip...
An order of the Spicy Chicken...bow wow chicka chicka...
Brown Rice of course!
And an order of MooShoo pork ask him to put half in a box to take home for late night munchie factor...
Followed by 2 fortune cookies...always spin them, whatever way the points are pointing thats yours!!

Oh yeah and remember after reading your fortune.. you must say \"IN BED\" loudly after reading it.....makes it better.

Rock on Twangs."}
{"text":"I give it 2 stars just because the food quality was poor. I think their customer service is great but I ordered their Pad Thai with chicken and some additional vegetables (broccoli & carrots) and the dish itself hardly had chicken and the tofu was tough. 
It also had some sort of sandy texture pieces which was weird. For what you pay it's not worth it. Oh well I'll have to get my rice noodle cravings somewhere else. 
The place looked packed so maybe it depends on what dish you order, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"We hadn't eaten at PF Changs for couple of years until the end of last year. We've eaten there three times since December 2017 and have been delighted with the flavor of the food and the excellent service that we have received. We definitely will continue to go there."}
{"text":"This time of year it's pretty crazy and everyone is running around like crazy.  We sat and ordered some lettuce wraps and salty calamari and then got our name called to go eat upstairs.  The lettuce wraps were very tasty as usual, but the calamari was a bit chewy and tough.  We ordered three dinner entrees which included the pad Thai chicken, honey walnut shrimp with melon balls and the Chilean sea bass with mushrooms and veggies.  The Chilean sea bass was amazing, as was the walnut shrimp.  The pad Thai noodles were tasty, but the chicken was a bit tough and chewy.  

This location is always super busy but we had a great waiter, Ricky, and he took excellent care of us.  The service was great, the food was pretty tasty.  It's always crazy on the strip, but if you want PF Chang's, then this will have to do."}
{"text":"My wife and I are happy to say, great food, great service and a lovely decor.  A 5-7pm Mon-Fri Happy hour with discounted drinks and special food discounts. Our Waiter Brandon was personable and humorous.
We will return."}
{"text":"Always loved P.F. Chang's and they have always been a bit slow on service but the lettuce wraps are to die for.  Today was quite odd - there was a shift change and we had to wait for approx 7 mins on top of the 5 mins for hostess to come out with the people sitting there ever so patiently who had already been waiting for approx 6 or 7 mins  - don't think a shift change should come into play when taking care of customers - so i knock off 1.5 stars Just did not have the time to wait - strike 1 on to clam jumpers..."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The lettuce wraps are out of this world.  I have tried other versions, and P. F. Changs wins hands down.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I was unimpressed with my food and I am even more sad to see, now that P.F Chang's mass produces frozen dinners. 
This is about as far away from Chinese food you can get, unless of course you are eating microwaved warmed shrimp fried rice. The restaurant is cluttered and the music was up so loud.  I had to yell to carry on a conversation. P.F Chang's in the Waterfront is a unmemorable experience. Maybe I would have better luck microwaving my own meal at home?"}
{"text":"Party of 8.  We had a bad experience with an aggressive bartender and a disagreement ensued.    When we were served food we spoke with the manager and he was very abrupt and unwilling to to help us reach a solution.    I guess they are too busy to care.    I will never go again and we went often and spent $$$.  November 11 evening"}
{"text":"Even though P F Chang's is kind of out of our way, it used to be worth the trip for special occasions.  I appreciate that they're willing to cook previous menu selections that are no longer on the menu, like double pan fried noodles.  Knowing that it's always packed in the evenings, especially on weekends, we had a reservation last night for 6:30.  We were finally seated at 7:00 and had food by 7:30.  Our service was slow, we spent most of the evening with empty drink glasses, and everyone agreed the food wasn't spectacular.  It's disappointing when a favorite restaurant loses its charm."}
{"text":"PF Chang's is a nice place to bring a client for a Lunch meeting.

Or, maybe I should say it's a safe place.  I came here recently and the food was as I had remembered it -- Asian inspired and quite good. 

They have some solid dishes like Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Chang's Spicy Chicken (their version of General Tso's).  I love their Hot & Sour soup, and our family still remembers the first time they tried their Lettuce Wraps and Dan Dan noodles.

But over the years, it seems PF Changs has become a caricature of itself  Sometimes the service is good, as it was today.  Other times, it just seems as if the waitstaff is new and has never worked in a restaurant before. See Gabi's review from three years ago. Also, sometimes the food can be off, ie: dried or not hot rice, etc.  I'll end it here, since it looks like I've used up my allotment of the word 'sometimes'.

So, Three Stars \"A-OK\".  But, they're on my Watch List for a possible downgrade."}
{"text":"So we came here on a random Tuesday night for dinner. I've been here once before and had take out one other time and always found it decent food but forgettable and therefore  have forgotten to review up until now. I was told the lettuce wraps were good here so we decided to stop in!

Chicken Lettuce Wraps 4/5 stars - these were yummy and I could have made a meal out of it alone!!

Spring Rolls 2/5 stars - ehh they were only okay not a lot of taste going on here except for the heaviness of the lemon grass. The sauce to go with it was just yucky. I do feel spoiled by another restaurant which I love who has amazing spring rolls so I can't help but compare.

Mongolian Beef 4/5 stars - I didn't order this but tried it and I really liked it!! I definitely liked it better than the beef that was on my dish!!

Thai beef and noodle salad  3/5 stars - I honestly am not sure how to review this one. The taste was pretty good and they allowed me to take out the cucumber and add bean sprouts and I took out the mango. However there were no noodles in my salad?? Maybe I misread something but last time I checked it was supposed to have noodles in it. I didn't feel like waiting around for them to make a new one and they were busy and it was already getting late as we'd waited awhile. The beef was good but kind of dry and not as good as the mongolian beef. Overall I liked it enough that I will order it again to at least taste it the way it's supposed to be.

So averaging out it gets a little over 3 stars. I'm not sure I really want to round up on this one but since the Spring Rolls really drag it down and they were such a small part of the meal I will round up.

Oh the staff was super nice and did a rather good job considering how busy it was for a Tuesday night... Seems no one wanted to stay home on that warm weather day :)"}
{"text":"Peter was awesome!!!!!!! He made our post Britney dinner so extremely fantastic. Request his section."}
{"text":"I probably shouldn't review PF Changs, but feel it's my civic duty to warn anyone who still believes this is \"Chinese\" food, it's fusion, pretty Americanized and for whatever reason, always gives me the runs. ALWAYS! It's probably me, and you would think I have learned my lesson, but I try every so often to see if my stomach can handle it and every time, PF Chang's you bastard, you beat me."}
{"text":"P.F. Changs is actually quite tasty Ameri-Chinese food. I will say that some of the sauces are quite salty but they still taste very good and if you increase your water intake for the next few days, you should be able to level out any third spacing of body fluids and excessive hypertension that may occur. 

The Lettuce Wrap appetizers are really quite delectable. 

The service was very nice with a very ritualistic shpeal given about their salty sauce platter that includes Spicy Oil, Soy Sauce, Vinegar, Mustard and Hot Pepper mash. It was quite tasty but the server looked like a flight stewardess presenting the seat belt talk. Enjoyable to watch even though I was thinking about how busy my day was at work. 

I may add Sake' the next time to get my star count up to 4. The deserts look nice but I have only ever had the small cups that are literally 2 bites and a tortuous tease."}
{"text":"They give good sized portions and the service was good. The kung pao chicken did not taste anything like kung pao chicken. It was room temp and looked like it had been sitting around for awhile. The shaking beef was quite tasty. They removed the chicken from the bill without any hesitation. The place is overpriced for the quality of food that you get."}
{"text":"We sat outside on a nice evening.  Service was friendly, but a little slow.  The server seemed to disappear for long periods of time.

Food was good and serving sizes good for the price, which is typical for PF Changs.

Beer selection was good with some interesting craft brews.  

Overall a good dining experience for the strip."}
{"text":"I consider myself a god of chains... chain in the restaurant sense...  I really really like PF Changs.

Did you know PF stands for Paul Fleming?

Did you know the food is all gluten free??

Did you know that PF Changs is the parent company of Pei Wei?  Hmmmmm????

I Wikipedia'd 2 of those facts, I'm not that awesome.


Kung Pao Shrimp is the best I've ever had.  Service always fantastic.

Sea bass also very underrated dish.

4 stars why?????  Because I think it's a tad over priced, just a tad."}
{"text":"You can either have an amazing, fun foodie experience OR a slow error filled evening...that's how hit or miss the staff is (including the mgr). When they get it right though you will and your family will enjoy themselves with hearty portions and unique flavors. The front of the house staff arent helpful and do detract from the overall experience, even on a good night. I'd still recommend this location but be wary that you roll the dice on what your night out will be."}
{"text":"One of THE fave Saturday lunch spots with my BFF!

Been going to this restaurant since the beginning with it's original location of Scottsdale Fashion Square for 18 years!  

Consistently GREAT service, food,  and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Nice ambiance.

So glad they have kids meals now.  Last time I was there (long time ago) they didn't.  So your child can eat for between $2.95 and $4.95, including a drink.

The happy hour is decent.  I had a coconut lemon drop (YUM) for $6, hubby had a large sake for $4.  Plus I shared the edamamme and tofu potstickers with my girls.  There are three small ones for $3.25 but they are GOOD.

One child had the lo mein with tofu, one had buhdda's feast with tofu.  The buhdda's feast was just steamed carrot, broccoli and sugar snap peas.  The rice and sauce (she got sweet & sour) was on the side.

My birthday boy ordered off the gluten free menu and had the mongolian beef.  He scarfed it down.  Hubby had gluten free spicy chicken.  It wasn't hot enough for him so he added more pepper sauce but he did enjoy it.

I had the vegetarian spicy eggplant.  It was DELICIOUS.  $7.95 and I couldn't even finish it.

For my son's birthday they brought him a free mini dessert.  He chose triple chocolate mousse.  Usually they are $2.25 each.

Total bill was $70."}

Strikeouts-0/3

It's a chain restaurant all over the world, and i wanted to check this place out. The decor obviously matches up with the franchise, and surprisingly the wait staff was terrific. Accurate, fast pace and not rude. Our table was a table of 20, so that's saying something.

The selection of drinks was wide and broad. The menu is also just as vast. The main problem was running out of sushi at 6:30 is quite bad for any restaurant looking for the variety. We ordered many different apps and they were all alright, including the mains. Nothing was bad, but i have to say nothing was terrific I either. I believe this place is overhyped, but f you want a safe restaurant that isn't McDonald's, you should come here!"}
{"text":"P.F. Changs use to be the \"fancy\" place in the Goodyear area we would go to for a nicer date night meal. Unfortunately, the staff and management have dragged this place downhill. My husband decided to get our order to go and bring it home for us to eat. It was a Friday evening and the place was dead. The wait seemed abnormally long so he went to sit at the bar and he ordered a beer while he waited. 45 minutes had passed and he asked the bartender to close his tab with the 1 beer and he would also pay for his food to go that we were still waiting on. He handed her his card and she swiped it and then gave him his card back and the receipt to sign... $115! I'm sorry but 1 beer, 2 entrees, and a lettuce wrap appetizer does not even come close to $115! The bartender apologized and had mentioned she accidentally rang us up for the people next to him. She said she would reimburse the funds and then charge him for the correct amount. He was then handed another recipt which came out to the correct total of $45. After waiting close to 1 hour and 15 minutes, the food was finally ready. 

My husband's noodles were great, however my honey seared orange chicken was mediocre. It was extremely soggy, cold, and flavorless. It had zero crunch to it, and was not worth the wait or the hassle. I then proceeded to check our bank account, and sure enough, we were not refunded for the $115 charge, and we were also never even charged for our meal which was $45. 

We called that evening and spoke with the manager who had a rude tone and explained that it takes 3-5 business days for the refund to appear on our account. Yes, this is generally true, however, why were we only seeing the one charge? If they took care of the issue properly, we would have seen the charge of $45 on our account as well. Again, he had  no sympathy for us and proceeded to tell us, the customer, that we were wrong and that they handled the issue. He did not even take the time to speak with the bartender that we ordered from and see what the issue was and see how he could resolve it. 

I called our bank the next day to confirm, and they let us know that they only charged us for the $115. We are so grateful that at least Chase Bank has amazing customer service and they were extremely understanding and helpful. They let us file a claim and promise we would have our money back within 3-5 business days and we would only be charged for the $45 that we should have been charged for. After all this, our meal should have been free, but I'm glad at least Chase Bank was helpful. 

WE WILL NOT BE BACK. A manager can make or break an establishment, and in this instance, he has surely brought this place down with him. There are far better and authentic Japanese/Chinese food options in the Goodyear area and we will be happy to spend our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"\"Lite sushi\" lunch option indicated to me that PF Changs should stick to their Asian lunches. Waiter was a bit too playful for clients who are trying to have a business lunch."}
{"text":"Gross, what happened?! It has been a while since I have been to PF Chang's. It used to be one of my favorites...I remember going to a conference and I ate at the PF Chang's across the street from my hotel every day. 

This last time there was pure disappointment. From the quality of the food, to the service, to the taste it was as if I was at some cheap fast food joint. Each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base. It was way too salty! Since when did they start rationing out their rice? We got a very tiny portion of rice and we had to keep asking for more to soak up the salty sauce on the dish. Blah. The service was super slow to greet us at the table and to bring us what we needed. Made for a very unenjoyable experience. 

Blah...and I'm sad that it wasn't better."}
{"text":"Slightly better than average is what i would say to describe the food here. The Chicken with Black bean sauce; good. The garlic noodles; good. The hot and sour soup; good. I got it to go so I can't comment on the service here, except for the person who gave us our food. She was nice. 

Seriously, it's just good."}
{"text":"I love the lettuce wraps! I love the lettuce wraps. Mmmmmmmmmm. Great place for a date."}
{"text":"I love the service here now, the staff is excellent respectful and very professional. Their lettuce wraps never disappoint. Marcus is the best server I've ever had there! Thank you."}
{"text":"Very Convenient.  Ordered simple dish which was steam dumplings and a bowl of sweet and sour soup which was a very large bowl enough to feed 5 people.  Everything was ok, a little to the bland side.  This place was very busy but still had room for us without a reservation.
First time and probably will be my last, mainly because there are so many places to visit and eat at that I will not have enough time."}
{"text":"Great time here tonight. We did the call ahead seating and BAM walked in and was seated in under 3 min. Then waiter was super on point. He knew his menu extremely well gave recommendations and even made some good points to try sauces extra on the side that worked out AWSOME for the kids. On top of all of that food was hot prompt and exactly as ordered. I can highly recommend this location and only give props out when they are earned and this place has earned from phone call to host to wait staff kitchen staff all the way thru. In addition the place was super clean and well on its way to being a family favorite stopping point while in town great job 5"}
{"text":"Left out our brown rice. It's right on the order that y'all supplied. 
Left out the fortune cookies
Really horrible customer service. If you can't do it right close your doors and go out of business."}
{"text":"Extremely suspect considering a 5 star review starts with \"I don't care if it's not \"authentic\" or if it is considered \"the Olive Garden of Chinese restaurants\". I am obsessed with PF Changs.\"

Oh boy.

Forced to go here for a business dinner. Instantly wanted to stab myself with the fork. I'm obviously not from the area but you can pay half as much for the same type of food at Panda Express. Is there one nearby?

They had good service though."}
{"text":"I like most P.F Chang's locations I've visited.  I love the menu, including the crab rangoon wan tan starter, the lettuce wrap starter, and the ahi tuna salad.

I've also tried many of their entrees, and am never disappointed.

I give three stars to this location because it's a bit strange inside.  Unlike most PF Chang's, this one is sort of one big room, with a very tall ceiling, kind of like a barn.  As a result, it's less intimate and feels a bit down-scale, versus the typical PFC layout."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Chinese food since going gluten free almost 2 years ago. I had never been to a PF Chang's and was excited to learn of their gluten free menu.

I came to this location on a Wednesday night around 9:30 and let the hostess know I wanted to place an order to go. She directed me to the end of the bar to place my order which was taken fairly quickly and I was offered water while I waited for my food. I didn't notice the time, but I didn't feel I waited longer than you would expect to wait for food to be made. I ordered the GF lemon chicken with brown rice and the chocolate dome. The chicken was still warm and crunchy (not soggy like I was afraid it might be) by the time I made it back to my hotel room only about a half mile down the road. I dumped the rice next to the lemon chicken and broccoli, poured some of the lemony sauce and some of the gluten free soy sauce they sent home with me over the rice and enjoyed every bite using the chopsticks I found in my takeout bag (also in the bag was a plate, fork/napkin combo and 2 fortune cookies that I was warned were NOT gluten free, but everybody should have the opportunity to at least read their fortune even if they don't eat the cookie). 

The chocolate dome is a dense, fudgy, flourless chocolate blob (it was actually a very nice round shape vs a true blob) that by itself is ok. Topped with the berry sauce and eaten with the raspberries, blueberries and strawberries it comes with is what made it really good. I ate my whole entrée and the whole freakin' blob when I probably should have stopped about half way through both. I'd definitely like to visit the Salt Lake location and try something else. Beef next time I think."}
{"text":"If you want an upscale Asian restaurant this is the place. The food is amazing and worth every cent. The service there is quick & the staff is friendly. The place sells itself. Never had a bad experience or bad taste of the food.

I love the Mongolian beef & recommend it to anyone that likes meet."}
{"text":"I've never understood the huge mass appeal of this place.  After this location opened (the first in town), there was such a buzz going on that I was thrilled when one of my directors took the cast out to eat here.  I excitedly made my little lettuce wrap and took a big bite and...

buh?

That's IT?  That's what people have been raving about?  It's not that it's BAD food, it's that it doesn't live up to the hype.  The subsequent times I've been here I've felt the same way.  I've had unappetizing spring rolls, too greasy reef with broccoli, and soggy crispy honey shrimp.  I've always left longing for a more authentic Chinese experience and a higher quality one as well."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for the quality. Although P.F. Chang's does have a special place in my heart... it is nothing more than mediocre. Its a great place to go on special occassion if you want friendly service, but for much cheaper you can go to Pei Wei for basically half the price but for the same quality. (It's owned by the same family)"}
{"text":"If you eat here be sure to bring cash.  I treated myself to a moms night out and I was told that the card reader wasn't working so, if I could sign an old fashioned paper receipt machine like they used in the \"I love lucy\" days (charge o plate),  I agreed, then found that they charged me for an order twice as much as I payed for. When I called the manager (aka the run around) she told me that the used my \"friend'\" card.  I was there alone, why what she trying to insist that I was in the wrong and some how trying to take advantage of them.  She was hostile and rude.  She insisted that she would have to speak to her manager.  Then when I called back they said they refunded the money to my card already. (what happened to the manager)  I had obviously checked my account and it was not credited so I had them double check the card number.  Sure enough they refunded to the WRONG card number, and was very hostile and rude about THEIR mistake.  So finally after she saw for herself they had made their she finally reversed the charge.  Trying to make it seem like they did me a huge favor.  It was a good thing I check my account daily.  I wonder if the others who were affected by this transaction are even aware that there was an error.  I am writing mostly about the unprofessional and rude behavior when I transaction error has occurred.  People use their checking accounts for multiple transactions, including, rent, mortgages, car payments. PF Changs needs to be more careful, and apologetic.  Be very careful and keep your receipt.  That was a life saver.  They asked me for it every time.  The food wasn't even that great."}
{"text":"This is where PF Changs began and my first dining experience here.

Fun, dim-lit restaurant not too far from old-town.  Service excellent.  I didn't care for the dragon oolong tea.  It had a fruity, mangoeey after taste to it and did not taste like traditional Chinese tea.

Nicely ventilated.  The food is typical chinese but served in a posh-ish, peppish sort of \"fine dining a la in a chain sort of style.\"

Still, enjoyed the food.  Also, the restrooms have a cool bamboo faucet that's neat."}
{"text":"Years ago they used to do sauces at the table and had variety of tea. Now tea is just what they give you. No sauces. Wait at the front always seems so long despite open tables seen. Kung pow chicken is my husband's fav but I do not eat rice but found a salad with tuna that was tasty. I guess I find this restaurant overpriced for what you get. Service is awesome that much I will give them! But for real Chinese food I will head to Spring Mtn"}
{"text":"I've heard it's very much a chain and that it's not at all authentic Chinese food, however despite all that I have to admit the food was good and the service was excellent.  There is quite a disconnect with the loud Rock music played in the dining room and the serene Chinese decor, but I figure it works for somebody!  I ordered the Ginger Chicken with Broccoli and the meal was quite tasty.  The prices are quite reasonable.  Just as long as you are not looking for authentic Chinese dishes, this restaurant will definitely serve in a pinch."}
{"text":"Request Peter as your waiter! It was like having a comedian as our waiter. This one definitely our best experience here at PF Changs! Awesome service from everyone"}
{"text":"Just time for a quick review: called to order takeout at this location, not knowing the dinner for two was a dine in only option. The call center rep who answered the phone transferred me directly to the store's line, where the manager jumped on the phone and said that at her location she is happy to serve the dinner for two option as takeout. She also gave me a work-around for thr next time I wanted to call and order where i could reach the store directly instead of the call center. Refreshing to have someone who provides that level of service and who takes charge to bend a menu nuance in your favor. Nice work Ms.Manager!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Haven't been there for several years and won't go back again. The service was horrible - food came out timely but the quality of the food has significantly deteriorated. Had chicken in my stir fried rice - it was literally small narrow strips of chicken. The crispy honey chicken is soggy and has no flavor - I even questioned if it was the correct dish. The waitress could not get anything straight - we had to continuously request the same things over and over. Will not be going back and would not recommend - save yourself some grief and go to panda express if you want chinese."}
{"text":"I ordered Ma Po  Tofu, my husband ordered sweet n sour chicken, his food was fine,  when I got my dish I was totally disappointed. I have never seen Ma Po Tofu done this way,  they had deep fried the tofu, then stir fried in the sauce. The taste  and texture was awful,  I had about 3 bites of it, then I just ate the steam rice.  The waitress, was not the greatest either, I couldn't even get a refill on water, nor did she bother to even ask me if everything was ok with dish, seeing that it was practically untouched, when we asked for the check.  Disappoint in taste and service!"}
{"text":"A haiku, Ode to the Chang:

{"text":"\"You haven't been to PF Changs?! \" That's what everyone always says.  So I had to try it.  Would it live up to it's hype?  I can't say that it is an outstanding restaurant.  The food isn't much different than my local Chinese joint.  I can feed my family for around sixty dollars at my local place.  Twice as much at PF.  I'm not going to say it's bad,  it's just regular Chinese at a better decorated place with higher prices."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. 

Is it super authentic? Well, no. Head over to West Mesa if that's what you're looking for - you'll have tons of options with all sorts of interesting protein options. This is a chain restaurant with Asian inspired food for American tastes - so don't be complaining about what \"Chinese food should be.\"

Went on a Friday in the midst of snowbird season (and long waits - ugh, is it June yet???) and were quoted a 40 minute wait. We went to the bar to wait and they called us 5 minutes later (and before our drinks had been fully served and after we had just ordered an appetizer, which was a bit awkward.) 

Great service at the table and at the bar. 

For 2 we split an entree (orange peel chicken) and 2 sides (green beans, noodles.) Plenty of food for 2! Everything was tasty - I reallllly liked the green beans. Nicely blistered and a tasty, spicy sauce. 

Good stuff."}
{"text":"I have been to several P.F. Changs...the food is good , but not outstanding.  The menus is pricey, which is common for a more high end Chinese place. The service is very friendly, but typically slow everytime I have gone. Enjoyable, but definitly not outstanding!"}
{"text":"Not the best P.F. Chang's. I'm used to our regular P.F. Chang's out in my home town. Way better service than this location. Servers fight with each other and there is a lack of communication between servers. By the time I received my complete order everything else was cold. I would stay away from this location. Enjoy your hometown location and keep that image alive."}
{"text":"To be honest, I really don't consider the food here to be Asian. It's very far removed, but about one step away from being American cuisine. The food here is really good, don't get me wrong. Just don't come in here expecting exciting authentic Asian cuisine. It's \"safe Asian\" for the whitebread, Scottsdale community. 

Regardless, the service here is always really good and efficient. The waiters always bring the dishes at the right time and check up on your multiple times to see how everything is. Considering the portions you're offered, you get a pretty good pricing for a meal if you're sharing. Overall, I tend to think the food is more filling than it is flavorful, but that's just my opinion. Some people swear by this place... I am not one of those individuals. The Kung-Pao Chicken isn't bad and it seems to be a staple at this place. The dessert shot glass things are a recent addition to the menu and are actually really good. I wish more restaurants would think of using these because it makes sense after eating a huge meal to get something small rather than a sundae the size of a T-bone.

In all, P.F. Chang's is pretty good. It's a nice spot to have a dinner with friends or family because alot of the dishes are made to be shared. If you're looking for real Asian food however, you're not going to find it here and are better off trying a smaller, family-run place.

(Side note: P.F. Chang's is probably Phoenix's most successful franchise export. They've got locations in LA, Vegas, and a few other cities.)"}
{"text":"Alright, first things first, don't even attempt to drop in on a weekend night because you will end up waiting 30-45 minutes for a table, just like every other restaurant in this little 83rd and Bell district.  Having said that, our friends had made reservations the Tuesday night and we only had to wait five minutes

Now our server was quite strange, a large, bubbly, bald headed man.  However, still very nice and made sure everything was in order and even though it was packed, he checked on us very often.  I was quite impressed.  The ladies shared a bottle of wine, I had the Manhattan, and my friend had a Bud Light.  The food was delicious and great company always makes for a great meal regardless.

For my girlfriend and I, having been our first time, we really enjoyed the atmosphere here, even though it was crowded the lighting makes it personal.  Great staff, and delicious food is always a big plus.

I can't wait to come back here!

P.S.  Order the Chicken (vegetarian option available) Lettuce Wraps to start, everything will flow from there!!"}
{"text":"Poor service, food was just okay in comparison to other PF Chang's I've eaten at. May or may not return."}
{"text":"What a great night. Always great food and great service. Wish all major chains did good and service this will."}
{"text":"I sort of felt ambivalent about this place immediately after eating. The food was okay but not extraordinary. Though I should mention I am vegan, so I only had so many options. But if you don't eat meat, this is probably a good option in las Vegas, where I've found, options are quite limited. The lettuce wraps have a delicious filling, but they'd be better on romaine (not iceburg). The ma po tofu is a really big portion of both broccoli and spicyish orange sauce on crispy tofu; it's good but kind of heavy to attack by oneself. Everything is priced okay, but still, I wouldn't have gone here if it weren't for the terrible vegan options in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Never fail to deliver a tasty meal...love it!"}
{"text":"I have had lunch here a couple times, and dinner a couple times years ago. The restaurant site right in front of the office building that I work in so it is an easy walk across the parking lot.  I had the hand made egg roles which are outstanding and the Chicken lettuce wrap which was also fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been to this one and the one in Green Valley and I have to say that I'm just not that impressed.  I mean, the food is good and its certainly a nice enough place but I like the food at China-a-go-go better, and its a hell of a lot cheaper.  

I guess this place is fine for high school graduations, Mothers Day, and dad's birthday, you know, when you want to go out for a \"nice\" dinner (but not an overly expensive one).  

The staff was nice and took good care of us but I left here not caring either way if I ever returned."}
{"text":"I'm on a gluten free diet. I think I've tried most of the items on the gf menu and have yet to be disappointed. The spicy chicken has the right texture of crispness, sweet and spice. Sooo good! The Mongolian beef is excellent. Fried rice is delicious. The pad Thai is good. The only thing, no fault of PF Changs, but if I get take out on the crispy chicken or Mongolian beef by the time I get the home, they're both soggy. I recommend eating there while it's nice and hot. The gf desserts are delicious too."}
{"text":"Not good not bad, this location is not as good as others. Okay for whitey Chinese food. If you put enough sauce on anything it tastes okay. Service was okay although asked for grn beans to come out with dinner and they came with lettuce wraps at the beginning."}
{"text":"I ordered the jicama tacos like I always do lately except this time came with a ton of red peppers. I told the waitress and she insisted they remake it. I told her they usually come with one red pepper each and I got back the exact same tacos about a minute later with the same amount of peppers. Picture attached"}
{"text":"Great appetizer menu....so tasty looking that we chose a wide variety and called it dinner.  Both rib selections and the egg drop soup were especially good along with spring rolls and crab wonton that were good too.

On prior visits I've enjoyed and can recommend the Mongolian beef and the various preparations of steamed sea bass."}
{"text":"This is a nice Asian-fusion alternative for dining on the strip, since it is located inside the Planet Hollywood casino. Really nice atmosphere, excellent service and good food. The only reason I am not giving this restaurant a 4 or 5 star, is because I though the food was a little too salty for my taste and P.F. Chang's tends to have a limited Vegetarian menu. This was no big deal, because the next time we are in Vegas and nearby, I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Whoever puts the menu together deserves an award. I'd say there's something here for everyone. Good food and a great atmosphere, you're just missing some good people to take with you to enjoy it with!  
Customer service: Their customer service has been impeccable, I've been here several times and they're always very friendly and attentive checking in with you frequently. 
Cuisine: Recently I have been coming in for their lunch specials and for $10.99 you just can't beat the quality. I've had the Chicken curried ramen noodles and it is just fantastic, this dish really hit the spot leaving me full and for just 2.99 you can get a side salad. I think I had the cabbage crunch salad and wow it is deceivingly tasty with a very nice suttle dressing with some crunchy texture. What a good combo. Another dish worth trying is the Mongolian beef bowl, a good amount of beef with a nice sweet tangy sauce on it with plenty of rice. Im sure I'll be back to try more lunch items. 
Given it being the lunch special I still need my coffee and their coffee is surprisingly good. I would say bold. Well done PF Chang's! 
Ambiance: It's a nice atmosphere with table and booth seating. The music is just the right tone. I'll have to go for dinner one of these days. 
Location: Conveniently located at the District shopping center, grab a bite then go shop!"}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, but I am definitely a fan of the Chang's.  Located at Phillips Place near SouthPark Mall, it serves as a central meeting place for lunch with the girls that come from the far corners of the Charlotte area and has consistently good service and food.  

Meeting a girlfriend here for lunch today, we were both starving when we got there and couldn't wait to dig in.  My dining companion started off with the Salt & Pepper Calamari, which I did not have any of, but it appeared to be well prepared, and must have been good because she ate it all (it's not a huge portion).

Their lunch items are served with either a cup of soup or a salad.  I chose the egg drop soup - it is so good here.  Light, with a good broth, with whisps of eggs rather than big ole globs.  Served with fried crispy strip things (you know what I am talking about) that were light and fresh.  For my entree I ordered the Mongolian Beef, which I LOVE.  That is my all-time favorite dish and I almost always order it (I am boring, once I find what I like, I stick with it, lest I order something else and be pissed if I don't like it).  It is served with white or brown rice or for $1 more, fried rice.  The beef was tender, well cooked and all nice-sized quality pieces of beef.

For dessert (I told ya... I was starving... and I knew my dinner tonight was going to be a $.20 package of ramen noodles) I ordered the Banana Spring Rolls which are pretty much bananas wrapped in a spring roll wrapper, fried and then served with coconut-pineapple ice cream and drizzled with caramel and vanilla sauces.  Light-ish and quite good.  Different.

Service was very good, as it generally is whenever I go to PF Chang's.  For lunch, a drink and dessert, it was $22, which is more than I usually pay for lunch, but it was quite good and a nice afternoon with a good friend."}
{"text":"The appetizers and desert were fantastic but everything else in between stunk!  We were seated 1/2 hour late with reservations, the dishes were dirty and had to be sent back twice.  No sesame on the sesame chicken and the crispy honey chicken was a child portion and soggy.  Then we were solicited from some kid asking for money and at the end of the evening were presented with a bill from another table.  The entire time we communicated to the staff but we just kept getting excuses.  I think they apologized twenty times.  Next time I'm going to another location.  The Rampart location is awful!"}
{"text":"When I get hungry and don't feel like cooking at home, I usually make arrangements to pick up food here at this PF Chang's. It's the one closest to my house and it's settled next to the District.
The Lo Mein and dumplings, which I frequently order from here, are always delicious every time I eat them! I will never get sick of them for as long as I live."}
{"text":"Twice we came  - twice it was a bust. 
So - this is now my second experience at a PF Changs.  First time was in Honolulu -and it was not a good experience, second time was here and once again it was not good 
Our server was excellent, but the food was so underseasoned 
We had the lettuce wraps - and since PF Changs was the originator of them you would think they would do them well - they were not good - and the sauce is so boring.  We also had the deep fried green beans - which were ok - mostly because of the sauce. The buddhas feast dish was, like everything else - underseasoned and lacked flavour. 
I wanted to like PF Changs - I have tried 2 now - and that's it - I won't give them a try again.  
Both times were a waste of money and a disappointment."}
{"text":"We ate at PF Chang's inside The Planet Hollywood casino on Feb 14. We were very disappointed with the food. The lettuce wraps had almost no chicken in them and only came with one tasteless watery sauce. My chicken dish was so over cooked that the chicken was dry and tasteless and didn't  eat it. My wife's pepper steak came but did not taste at all like pepper steak and the beef was tough.  She sent it back and ordered Mongolian beef. The food was cooked perfectly but the sauce was salty. The fried rice was tasty. We have eaten at several PF Chang restaurants and have been exceptionally pleased with the food, but were very disappointed  his time. The manager did comp part of the meal, but the point was we were looking forward to a great meal and were definitely let down."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Chinese restaurants.  Love those lettuce wraps.  We were surprised this location was easier to get into that the Summerlin one."}
{"text":"The best chineese I have ever had! Really nice ambiance and atmosphere the lighting was perfect really set the mood to eat even though we had been eating all day since we were on vacation! I didn't know what to expect seeing as it was in the front of planet Hollywood but we didn't make reservations and we didn't have to wait to be seated. When we were seated they gave us a nice booth in the corner that was really private. Super good service we were attended to the whole time didn't have to ask for anything! We had the dinner for two which included a list of things to choose from I had gereral pao's chicken she had the Mongolian beef. We had hot and sour soup to start out with which was great since I've never tasted two hot and sour soups the same and it 
really varies on a scale of bad to great. They also brought out some chile 
sauce, vineger, and some Asian sauce( can't remember what it was 
called) which really heightened the taste of the soup and the lettece wraps we had as an appetizer. For desert we skipped the small shot glass deserts and went with the biggest piece of chocolate cake I have ever seen let alone eaten (yum) ! Really great food good service and just an overall nice fining experience! Have gone back there again but this time in Seattle still really good!"}
{"text":"Very delicious, all Time. I like Salat... and...
Nice People and best Service. Nice Location. I like P.F. Change's and come back. :-)"}
{"text":"Kiley was a awesome waiter and Ashley the manager even came to check on us.  The food was great.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times when visiting my folks in Henderson. Recently we made reservations for 8 at 7PM on a Saturday. The reason I'm just giving it a \"Meh\" is because of the wait time...although we had a reservation, it didn't matter. I notice in other restaurants there's usually a \"reserved\" sign on the table. Wondering if it might work for PF Chang's?

The staff was nice, food was good especially the cumin lamb, but the wait time was super irritating. Noticed other parties who had reservations waited a long time. At least the small parties could sit at the bar. 

Would I return? Only if my parents really wanted to visit again."}
{"text":"Great service tonight and yummy food. Our server was a really helpful young man who was knowledgeable about the menu and had some great suggestions for our group of 4. The food was fantastic as always and portion sizes are always enough for 2 meals... I love having leftover PF Changs for lunch the next day! Over all a fabulous girls night out, fun, relaxed, awesome signature cocktails, delicious food, fantastic service, and a cozy environment! We will be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Sooo delicious!! Had the chicken egg rolls, Chang bbq ribs, Schuan asparagus, lobster avocado roll, orange chicken and delicious pineapple/coconut ice cream! All fabulous! Came hot, not room temp., like some other restaurants! Our server, Manny, cares about and cares for his patrons! He is simply all about pleasing the people he is serving! We have eaten at many PF Changs all across the USA and this location is by far NUMBER ONE for service and food!!"}
{"text":"I was a little irritated that I was eating at a chain restaurant while in Las Vegas, but it was my cousin's anniversary dinner so of course, she gets to pick.  After being grumbly about the situation, I actually REALLy enjoyed my meal.  I had just recently eaten at another PF Changs, but this experience was much better.  

Because we had two couples we each ordered the meals for two and shared everything.  I had the egg drop soup and it was REALLY good.  I also had a taste of the wonton soup.  Also good, but I do love egg drop soup!  We had these yummy pan fried pork dumplings and chicken lettuce wraps to start and then we all shared the Pepper Steak, Crispy Honey Chicken, Crispy Honey Shrimp, and Mongolian beef.  My cousin also added a noodle dish.  OH MY GOSH!  Way too much food!  But it all tasted really good and we really enjoyed the meal.  There were two boxes of food to take home afterwards.

The service was timely and attentive, even thought the restaurant was quite busy.  We had a reservation, so there was no wait to be seated.  

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to someone looking for Asian food at the Planet Hollywood.  It's a chain, but it is good, I admit it!

WHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET FIVE STARS?
~Not be a chain restaurant?  I don't think that's entirely fair, but for me what makes a five star restaurant is something unique.  I can eat at a PF Changs any time, anywhere, so that takes away a little something from the experience."}
{"text":"The place looks nice, food is so-so, and employees should work on their attitude. We ordered spicy chicken, and it was sweet, not spicy. Next day we ordered same dish, and specifically asked our waitress to make sure the dish is spicy. Dish arrived, and again, it was sweet, not spicy. The waitresses seem to be pissed, she didn't smile, and had angry eye contact. She spilled our drink right in front of us. Even over all this, I left 30% tip. Waitress didn't even say thank you. She just picked up the folder with sour face and left. Duh."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's used to be our go to upscale, Asian Fusion dining establishment of choice.

Between the SFS and the Mill Avenue locations, we must've visited 100+ times over the years.

Then either our palates changed , or their quality declined, or a measure of both; but we just stopped dining here and chose other options.

However, we were famished after the Can-Am 500 at PIR; and since there is a dearth of Chinese Cuisine options in this side of town, we opted to give P.F. Chang's a chance.

The place was understandably busy with all the activities going on in the West Valley, but we paid no mind to the prolonged wait due to the fact that we were hungry and we didn't really want to fight traffic on an empty stomach.

We were with several of our friends, and everyone chose an Entree so that we could share in the variety of dishes.

Our server was okay. But, with the myriad of customers here; she just seemed overwhelmed and showed less than a friendly attitude. After she took our initial order, she barely checked on us, until it was time to settle the check - and that was an arduous task as well.

The Mongolian Beef was as good as I remembered. The beef was well prepared, and the sauce that it was cooked in was not overdone.

However, the new addition to the menu that I had no experienced before; which was the Spicy Korean BBQ Chicken was not up to our expectations. The dish was actually quite bland. If you know Korean BBQ, spicy or otherwise, you know that there is definitely a distinct taste to it that comes alive in your mouth.

Not this particular dish. The presentation was good, but the execution fell flat. We experienced the same lack of distinct flavor from the Kung Pao Chicken as well.

I am not sure if during preparation that the right amount of sauce ingredients were applied, but it was definitely not in keeping with what we thought P.F. Chang's used to represent and symbolize - unique, distinctive, and quite tasty Asian dishes."}
{"text":"Great meal. Good cocktails. Waay to pricey for an Asian food chain. It suffers from the typical Middleton restaurant dilemma: we'd like more people that just Middleton to come, but we know they can't afford it. They interior is attractive, but as with many restaurants, tables are tightly packed. I'd eat there again, but expect to drop a some coin for a dinner and round of cocktails."}
{"text":"I went to this location on 1/1/2015 and my experience was not pleasant. The waiter 'Bri' was very unprofessional and was rude. She made my birthday dinner horrendous. My food was taken from me without being asked if I was finished. My friend also said she wanted to box her own food three times but Bri went ahead and did it anyways after we told her not too. We were trying to make this birthday dinner special, but we felt so intimidated by Bri that we didn't even tell her that it was my birthday. She knew we were dissatisfied with the service, but when she gave us the check she told us she went ahead and added the 20% tip. I was appalled!"}
{"text":"From the apps to the desserts, I have not had a bad meal. Yes, you can find one in most major areas, but its good food. Why not hit the places you know are dishing out consistent meals?"}
{"text":"We ordered the kid's lo mein, Mongolian beef, spicy chicken, & spicy tuna roll. Everything was absolutely phenomenal & our waitress, Kristina, was even BETTER! I also had the Asian pear mojito and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"If I had to use one word to describe my experience : Depressing. And even that is being generous.
      I came in with two of my friends for new years eve before continuing on to the remainder of the evening. We ordered drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. My friend and I ordered the Asian pear mojito, which was decent. My other guest ordered a jack and coke and was immediately depressed to discover that it was all jack Daniels and a splash of coke for color.
   When we got to the table, we were hoping for a better experience. Little did we realize, we would suffocate while holding our breath. 
      We ordered the combination fried rice, described  containing egg, chicken, pork, shrimp, and beef. When it arrived to the table, the only egg that was present was the ones we were wearing on our faces.
     We also ordered the honey chicken and the beef with broccoli and again hoped for better quality. There were no complaints with the chicken, the only star of this evening. 
      The beef was disappointing to say the very least. To start, the kitchen sent out Mongolian Beef, rather than the intended entree. When they refired the dish, and it was presented, it looked better than it actually was. Never in my life have I bit into a piece of beef and instantly fear cracking a tooth. The beef in the dish was tough, and crunched (again a new first for me). 
              It will most likely be a very long time before I return. My only regret is I cannot leave a 1/2 star rating."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience until now.  App was cold. Had to ask for our soup when they brought the entree. Won't stop coming, but not a good experience this time around.  Kept hearing \"the kitchen is slammed\". Sorry. Not my problem. Oh well. Maybe nec"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. Special gluten free menu, sweet &spicy chicken was delish! Hubby had kung pao
Chicken from regular menu. Huge portions!  Flourless chocolate dome for dessert just decadent.  Our server Casey was delightful. 
We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"PF Changs is my favorite. I absolutely love the freshly made to order way things are done here. I have visited in Vegas, New Jersey, New York & California all consistantly great food. I always start with the lettuce wraps and I recommend you try them."}
{"text":"Who ever is running this restaurant needs some serious lessons on costumer service. We come to this location at least every other week. We always come here because the servers are very friendly and they always work with my food allergies and vegan diet. I usually get the California roll, with no meat and no cucumber (so an avocado roll) with no sesame seeds because I'm allergic. The general manager comes up and says they don't do any substitutions here. I inform him that yes you do because I literally get this every time I come with no problems. I was here just last week and they had no problem with this. He then replies \"Well I can't do it today for you, if it were tomorrow I could maybe do it... or more then likely do it\" I asked him how does that even make sense?! In which he responded, it doesn't. LOL what a joke. Will never be back to this location again, which is sad because we were regulars here and I always enjoyed myself here up until this point. Totally ruined our Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Had a great mother daughter lunch. It's been a while since I've eaten here and I wasn't disappointed. The restaurant was clean, friendly staff and a great food and drink menu. All the traditional Asian dishes with a nice twist to keep you interested and coming back. I had Crab Rangoon and orange chicken. My mom had egg rolls and chicken fried rice. They had a nice zesty dipping sauce for the egg rolls. The fried rice had egg, bean sprouts, carrots and peas which you don't see to often anymore. The Rangoon was delicious and came in two sizes which I love because my mom doesn't eat seafood so it's nice to get a small appetizer. The orange chicken was good. We also had blackberry martinis that were so fresh you can tell they're made to order. I saw a few items go to other tables that make me want to go back and try something different. We went on a Saturday afternoon and there was no wait plus parking was pretty convenient."}
{"text":"The best part of this place is Nicole the bartender.  She is always helpful, and very knowledgeable about how everything is prepared.

For the most part the nice thing about P F Chang's is consistency.  No matter where you go the food is always prepared exactly the same the way it should be. 

My only gripe is the price.  For what you get it is over priced, the food and drinks.  My average bill is $50.00 for two and we typically split an entree and small side, and both have a couple of beers.

In east mesa if you are looking for Chinese this is the best place I have found."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years. The hostess station was always ok, not going out of their way to be super friendly. The wait staff is always friendly as was the case when we went last Saturday night. The hostess station terrible and the bar staff even worse when we were waiting for a table. The bartender acted like we were bothering her. The bar wasn't busy at all, neither was the restaurant so there was no reason to act like that all. The restaurant was surprisingly empty for a Saturday night. From past reviews on Yelp for the same bar, its doubt we we'll ever go back. Our waitress was a rock star though. 

We took leftovers home and decided the next day while we were out to order more soup to take home. We ordered from their site for curbside pick up and filled out the form on their site including the make and model of our car. We got there on time and no one came out. My husband went in and the hostess said go to the bar. He did and they handed him the food took the money and said they knew nothing about any curbside pick up. Why offer it then??? Won't be going to that location anymore (Bell & 83rd). Apparently, they don't need the business since the place was dead anyway. I have 3 stars because our waitress was fantastic."}
{"text":"I revisited PF Chang hoping to enjoy the same dish that I cherished the last time around! Alas it wasn't meant to be!! The Dali chicken is off the menu:-(. The food here tends to be salty. We ate our standard staple of veg lettuce wrap... Delicious as usual and the pan fried veg dumplings ,tasty after using the spiced up dipping sauce. 
Kung pao chicken appeared to be a sweeter version of Dali chicken but doesn't march up to the latter. Singapore noodles and Buddha's delight are best avoided. 
Bottom line will return if Dali chicken makes a come back:-)"}
{"text":"Perfect lunch experience. I try to stay away from places like this usually because of the high sodium in the dishes but my server was helpful in guiding me to the lower sodium dishes plus she had the cook add no salt to my entrée. I got the Asian grilled salmon with brown rice with a side of egg drop soup. The soup was the best I've ever had . 2 thumbs up. Incredible."}
{"text":"This is the third time we have tried to enjoy an evening here. We arrived early and got the usual slow service and cold food. I can sometimes understand when there is an early (mini) rush but the kitchen should never put out cold food when the place is that slow! Plates were never cleared, to-go boxes never offered. Lobster roll was fishy tasting. No fortune cookies, and we had to ask for our check. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Literally the best PF Chang's. Went there with low expectations due to the typical Vegas crowds and we were blown away at the great service we received.  Andre and Damian were incredibly attentive, and accommodating. Thank you!"}
{"text":"awesome dumplings and delicious soup ! also i had the orange chicken and it tasted awesome! fast service great food, perfect lunch!"}
{"text":"Used to love PF Changs when we lived in CA. Have tried this location three times and each time thoroughly unimpressed. The service is fine, that's why two stars and not one, but the food is really blah, often like warm, and just lacks the pizzazz that I used to love Changs for. Way too expensive for the quality as well."}
{"text":"If you must dine on chain Chinese, you could do worse in Las Vegas. Then again, you could probably also do a whole lot better."}
{"text":"We were hungry, it was dinner time, we were near P.F. Chang's, so we ended up there. I thought the food was fine and pretty flavorful/cooked nicely for a chain restaurant. I really like the modern, dark decor at P.F. Chang's.

We ordered two sushi rolls -- one California and one dynamite scallop. The rolls were exactly the same, but one was served with a little sliver of scallop on top of each piece -- I guess that was the dynamite scallop? The were fairly tasty, just not the same quality of sushi I would get at Sushi Muramoto or another Japanese restaurant. 

Our waiter, while cordial and efficient, seemed pushy. My husband ordered a spicy entree, but the waiter suggested a different higher-priced spicy entree. When our server asked if we wanted dessert and we said no, he suggested we could order a dessert and take it to go. I can't think of any restaurant experience where I've ever felt like the server was up-selling, so this is a first! This definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.

I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service first time here you have to try the orange beef  and Kevin is the men's good server very helpful very friendly five stars"}
{"text":"i have been here 10+ times over the last 3 yrs normally the food is decent im part of the lunch crowd so i cant speak for dinner but my sesame chicken lunch special yesterday was mediocre half of the chicken pieces were so over cooked the were hard and dry some of the other pieces were better but not perfect ,service was good"}
{"text":"Always a winner!  Nothing bad to say...Great service by Sarah!!!"}
{"text":"I have dined here both during lunch and dinner and always leave with clean plate no leftovers great filling meals . I suggest the lettuce wraps as a appetizer they are great and not so filling to ruin your appetite for main coarse. I would say during height of dinner rush service is slow but I'm sure they are doing there best and if out with friends and family allows a lot of time to talk . Also ordered the duck once and it was great nice and juicy not dry like you sometimes get when eating out"}
{"text":"What's there not to love about PF Changs?  The lettuce wraps, the Edamame, the sweet-and-sour chicken so delicious.  I enjoy going there and the happy hour is such a deal.  Jonny is a great bartender. He makes excellent cocktails and his service is excellent. Very professional."}
{"text":"Saturday night and it was very, very busy.  We had a 45 minute wait.
Our server was pleasant, friendly, efficient, accomodating.  
The food was very good and portions large enough that we had food to take home!"}
{"text":"Won't be going back. The quality has suffered. Chicken wraps were horrible and the three of us didn't eat after the first few bites. Crab wontons were hard with no crab taste at all. Don't know what happened to the good food we expected."}
{"text":"We always enjoy PF Chang's, but this is one (located in Planet Hollywood - Las Vegas) does not fall in line with the others.  Okay service, not so great food.  Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything from the decor to the service to the food. Their lettuce wraps are absolutely amazing. I wish they served it as an entree.

I highly recommend (aside from the lettuce wraps) their chicken dishes, lo mein, Dan Dan noodles, or pad Thai. You truly can't go wrong, unless you get one of their more \"Americanized\" dishes. But that may be just me. Their portion sizes are huge which is a plus."}
{"text":"Visited here with friends during school residency. Just a notch up from a regular Chinese restaurant. Wasn't really impressed. Tried this spot again in Fresno but my rating will remain the same!"}
{"text":"Vegan review:

If you are vegan, run away!! There is nothing vegan here (except one thing but I'll get to that later) despite what you might have on the vegan blogs and PETA. 

I am vegan and I came thinking I could get a deliciously cooked meal, but boy was I wrong. As I always do, I asked the waitress if the foods I saw recommended to vegans online were in fact vegan. She said she wasn't sure so she brought the manager over to chat. He kindly told me that nothing on the menu was vegan but that they would be able to steam up some veggies for me. Not very exciting but it was something. I had steamed veggies without any seasoning or sauce and a bowl of rice. At least I was \"healthy\" heh heh. 

Saving grace: the service was A+ and the manager was super kind and apologetic. I appreciate the knowledge that the manager showed regarding the vegan diet. It feels unfair that I'm rating this particular establishment so low but I'm bummed there weren't more options for vegans. STEP UP YOUR GAME PF CHANGS CORPORATE!!"}
{"text":"Love this location! Maybe I'm partial, but the bartender Dominick is very knowledgeable :)"}
{"text":"Service was mediocre.  Asked for the dishes to come out as they're ready, because we were starving...but the dishes came out together and a few were lukewarm.  Since the temperature was off, they didn't taste that great. 

The interior is super-dark, in the afternoon, this was just annoying.  

The only plus is that they offer mini-pastries."}
{"text":"I came here for a department lunch. I wasn't expecting much considering the previous reviews. The food here is meh. 

It taste like the frozen meals you can buy in your grocers freezer. 

Save your money and buy the meals at the store

Overpriced
So-So service"}
{"text":"Overall a pleasant experience. Knowledgeable, friendly, and personable waiter. Everything came out on time, hot, and tasting excellent. All the employees were nice, and the big boss man even stopped by to see how everything was. Nice touch.

Love the bamboo water spout in the bathroom. A+.

My only beef is with the sauces. We ordered the Calimari, which is outstanding by itself, but I felt the sauce they provided was lacking something. Took me half the meal to finally figure out which dipping sauce went well with the little squiddies. Turns out it just needed some lemon juice."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Gluten Free shakin beef dish. Cook and delivered perfectly!"}
{"text":"Great place to dine, I went With My family to this place after a bad experience somwhere else, and even though it was like 20 of us it only took them 30 minutes to seat us and the server we had was really good. Everytime we go in such large groups we become a little complocated with the bills cause we want to split them, but our server was efficient and got the orders right and on time. I order the Lo mein and even though it sounds like a simple meal, I am very finicky, but the Lo mein here was delicious, I even order take out."}
{"text":"I travel for a living and have visited many restaurants around the world.  The two biggest things for me are service and the food.

When I first walked into this PF, it took a while for anyone to acknowledge us standing there.  It wasn't a busy time and the restaurant was pretty much empty.  Two people walked to the front and we had to ask to be seated before they finally realised we were patrons.

Once we were seated, our waitress was awesome and attentive.  The food was good, as it always is.

However, my issue is with either the management or the rest of the staff as most of them disappeared into the back room or wandered around.  I understand slow times, but come on?  When most of the tables had empty drinks and nobody was filling them up, what's going on?

So, as far as this restaurant goes, it doesn't come close to a couple of other PF Chang's that I've eaten at, like the one at Park Meadows in Colorado."}
{"text":"Service and quality has just gone downhill. Bummer.  Appetizers with no plate, wait staff doesn't pay attention.  I think this is more of a management problem.  The staff is busy and not standing around, but we are forgotten."}
{"text":"How to interpret the menu...think soy sauce. Everything tastes like soy sauce, even the curry! Sent plate back twice, spoke to some \"manager\" dressed in pink pajamas who tried to sell me more food, and acted offended by my complaint. Classy place sheesh"}
{"text":"Food was good but I signed up for their Email mailing list and understood I get a free appetizer when you sign up, turns out you have to have so many points to get it and the server didn't even ask if we had the rewards card so they can put our points on the account so my $50 meal didn't help earn a free appetizer yet lol"}
{"text":"I have always had great service and the food has been very good as well. The selection is very good and I usually always try something new and have never been disappointed. If only they had a good IPA on tap."}
{"text":"Always good eating at PF Changs! its always so consistent everywhere I go. I know what I like and it tastes the same no matter which Changs I go to. They have some fun drinks at the Vegas PF Chang's, check it out, if its not something you like don't think it will be any different if you go to a different one. you get the same food at all of them."}
{"text":"I love everything about PF CHANGS,  that's why I hate to give it a 4 star but my rice was terribly cold & the waiters we're kind enough to replace my whole meal but serving cold rice is a no no."}
{"text":"every time i go LV i stop in and get the lettuce wraps, great tasting, cheap and let the server make the sauce for you, a liitle soy sauce, mustard and hot,,,great mix...i love this stuff, try it, i bet you'll like them...."}
{"text":"Absolutely great place! I don't know why many yelpers gave 1-2 stars. I know that restaurant for years maybe 10 years and know the menu very well, service is always great and friendly, even when full they're fast in kitchen and very tasty every time. One more important thing is they changing and add to menu very often!"}
{"text":"Food presentation is good but the Ma-Po Tofu leans too heavily on salt. The Garlic Noodles were more subtle. The Spring Rolls were crisp and fresh from the fryer  Lunch prices seem reasonable. Portions  are reasonably sized rather than super-sized with lesser ingredients  Good place to take people who aren't too fussy about the authenticity of the food but want a step up from the swill that passes for Chinese food in most of Madison  Decor is very good and a definite plus. Service is fast, friendly, and efficient. There are gluten free and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Love this place! I haven't been here for a while, but I always get great service and the food is awesome!  What's even better is that they have a good selection of gluten free items. 

I went here today to celebrate my 12 year anniversary. Cindy was my server. She was very nice, very attentive, and just overall wonderful.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This dinner brought back a lot of Dubai memories. My first experience of P.F. Chang's was actually in Dubai many years ago. When it first opened, the wait for a table could have been anywhere from 1-2 hours, and people waited! That's because the food was always delicious!! 

This is the first time I tried P.F. Chang's in the valley. I did happen to try their Greenville, SC branch prior to moving to Arizona as well. 

We called in to reserve a table, they said there were no reservations. What you are doing by \"calling ahead\" is getting your name on the wait list. The wait was supposed to be 30-35 min when I called. I thought the wait started from the time you called in, kinda like other restaurants but the lady corrected me to say \"no, your wait time starts when you check-in\".

About 10 minutes after the call, we arrived at the restaurant and checked-in. I'm glad that even though we were very hungry, we agreed to the 30-35 min wait because we were seated in about 5-7 min! 

The restaurant was pretty full when we arrived (we got there at around 8). There are reviews on Yelp previously complaining about how dark the place is and it normally would be (because that's how every P.f. Chang is) but it wasn't. It seems as though the restaurant management took the comments into consideration and the restaurant was well lit up. 

My husband and I went through the menu and it had most of the dishes I was used to. We ordered the dynamite shrimp, the vegetable Lo Mein, Mongolian beef as well as Kung Pao chicken and brown rice on the side. The server was very helpful. When I first asked how spicy the dynamite shrimp was (because I know it was pretty spicy in Dubai) he let me try the sauce separately before I put the order in. It was pretty good and had the nice kick I was used to but I started coughing (embarrassing!) so he decided to bring us the sauce on the side. 

The dynamite shrimp came out in record time! It was however served in a regular plate and it felt like it had too much batter, I felt I was eating more batter than the shrimp. I wish they served it the way they did in Dubai, in cocktail glasses! It looked so impressive and it tasted like the bomb!! Every single time I was in he restaurant, every single table would have one of them. We even sometimes ordered one each! 

The food came out a little later. Everything looked pretty good but the portions seemed smaller than what I was used to. We dug in. Everything tasted good. The heat level was just right for all the dishes and the noodles were very tasty. 

Overall, our experience was pretty good. The service was excellent and our server was nice and checked in on us. The restaurant is nicer than most restaurants on our side of town which is a good change. 4 stars because although everything was good, in comparison to Dubai, the Dubai branch beats this branch on flavor."}
{"text":"Consistently good. We took advantage of the two 4-course special for $40...soup, starter, main & mini dessert. All yummy but the orange peel beef is awesome!"}
{"text":"To commercial 
They food is not good 
The service take FOREVER 
they place is super clean and organize , but for the price I would think it's better to get something good 
I never judge a place only by one time I go but for now it wasn't good"}
{"text":"The food  is good however I wanted fresh Ginger to put in my hot water they don't have fresh Ginger I was shock to hear that coming from a Chinese restaurant I wish they had fresh ginger but they don't"}
{"text":"The calamari and tofu pad Thai was great. 
Service started out transactional but ended as nicely personalized.   Good experience"}
{"text":"Tonight I spent $60 on an absolutely underwhelming meal.  It started with blase egg drop soup, greasy spring rolls, just average chicken dishes with dry rice! And the food was lukewarm.

This the second time, a PF Chang, has served us a mediocre quality of food..I can go to the neighborhood Chinese Buffet and have a much better meal for half the price.

 Since we were in Las Vegas, visiting, and there are thousands of restaurants, I was surprised at how robotic the waiter was and how below average, greasy and tasteless the food was.

I wish I had my $60 back!!  Advice:  Save your money, or go to your neighborhood Chinese joint!  There is no justification for charging those prices and delivering a crappy experience....Very upset and disappointed."}
{"text":"my family went to try it once.  we ordered their fried rice, was ok, but their beef broccoli was so salty.  good service made it well."}
{"text":"OMG the shrimp dumplings are my new fav thing on this menu. The sauce on the plate is my second. I could lick it up it's so tasty. The usual go to dishes were also amazing and great for sharing: shrimp and lobster fried rice, Brussels sprouts and Mongolian beef. 

Tried the ginger beer (I was the DD) and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"We've been to several PF Chang and this one in North Lake is by far the best.  Crowded but there was minimal wait time, well worth the short wait. Friendly staff, let them recommend the appetizers and main course. They have the best IPA, this place rocks."}
{"text":"The new location at Northlake Mall is insanely popular, so be prepared to wait for up to an hour or more to be seated.
It is popular for a reason though: excellent food and great service.

The lettuce wraps are a perfect appetizer, and in my experience, any of the chicken dishes are superb.
The prices are also better than you might expect. A single person can have a nice meal and a few beers and get out for around $20. Not bad.

The portions are also a decent size. There is plenty if you'd like to take some home, but they don't overload you, nor do you go home hungry.

The bar area is small, but a great place to wait for your name to be called, and if you're lucky you may snag a table there or outside on the small patio area.

Of course, there is quite a bit of jostling for these prime pieces of real-estate, and it can bring out the more interesting characteristics of a person's personality.

I'm docking one star due to the excessive wait times, but this is really due to the restaurant's popularity than to any organizational problems. 
Still, when it comes to food this tasty, I hate to wait! 

Four stars for you!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS P F CHANGS UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO PAY IN CASH!! I went there with my mother yesterday. She is visiting from another state. She left her credit card there. I called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off. A promise that the manager would call me. They said they were busy. HELLO. Checking to see if a customer left a credit card there is a priority in this day and age. My mother & I were calling. They put her on hold forever. They said it was not there but it is the last place she used her card."}
{"text":"Was having a great time great food great drinks until a drunk lady tripped on me and hit me in the face with her drink and knocked the food all over my girlfriend and I.... Then Walked away. I appreciate the response by the manager and specially the server.
 We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I hate to admit this, but I liked PF Chang's.  Before you go and lose all respect for me, keep in mind, this is coming from a vegetarian's perspective, whose choices at most chain restaurants are a salad with iceberg lettuce drenched in dressing with more calories than super sized fries at Mickey D's, and a minestrone soup that may or may not be made with beef broth.  PF Chang's at least, 1. recognizes vegetarians by offering a decent variety of veggie dishes, 2. labels them well, and most importantly, 3. tastes good. 

We were able to sample the majority of the veggie menu.  The chow fun was the weakest dish on the table--your standard noodles--but the lettuce wraps, coconut curry, and stir fried eggplant were all delicious.  They also offer brown rice, which is a huge plus.  My only gripes were that the seating was cramped, and there was a bit of a wait for a table.  Other than that, the prices are affordable, and the service was prompt and helpful.   

I'm all for the mom-and-pop businesses, but for what it is--a chain serving Americanized Chinese food--as a last resort, and as a vegetarian, or just someone who's conscious of their diet, you sure could do a hell of a lot worse."}
{"text":"Make sure to get the lettuce wraps, they were awesome! Excellent service, our server was friendly, prompt, and courteous, we're giving her & the others that served us 2 thumbs up! The food did not disappoint us & the price was reasonable for the quality & presentation. 

Will definitely come back! Oh, just a tip - make a reservation!"}
{"text":"So sad... I really miss the PF Chang's from years ago...  Shoulda seen it coming though after what the same private equity firm did to another chain favorite:  Rock Bottom Brewery.

The food is still serviceable, but it's nothing to write home about anymore.  Prices have gone steadily up while portions have gone from overly generous early on to reasonable to downright cheap & skimpy while quality has become inconsistent.   

I was there picking up a take out order this past week, and the disgruntled look of the servers just standing around by the bar commiserating on a slow night tells you everything you need to know.  It's just kind of a depressing environment.  Something is clearly broken here.

Props to the server working take out, though.  He was unusually pleasant and crazy fast/efficient. 

It's been a slow downhill for a while now, but I think I'm finally done with Chang's now :-(

Locally, you'd do much better with one of the Flo's restaurants or sadly ordering one of the asian-fusion dishes off the Cheesecake Factory menu next door in Kierland.  Ironically, Pei Wei is actually just as good now (though it's quick casual) and a vastly superior value."}
{"text":"Sadly only thing good was the service.

Came here for happy hour after getting off of work a little early. Not a huge fan of chain Chinese restaurants but decided to give their happy hour a try. No, we aren't cheap, but why go crazy spending money until you know if you're going to like what you're eating.

We started off a couple of beers, can't really messed that up. Decided to move on and try the lettuce wraps that everyone was talking about. We went with the vegetarian but it's wraps. The letters seemed to be the freshest thing on the plate. Additional Asian infused spaces with water chestnuts and a couple of other pre-frozen vegetables thrown in the mix. Sauce was decent but the overall mixture seem to lack freshness and freshness. 2/3

Next up work the crab Rangoon's. How can you mess these right? Seemed these have been sitting around for a while. The one time shall was frank perfectly. Golden brown and delicious. The inside seemed to be a pasty concoction of cream cheese and imitation crab meat. Not sure what happened but it just all seemed to merge together into paste. Gave these another 2/5.

We moved on to the pork dumplings and decided to get those steamed. Contest much of the pork feeling because of the thickness of the wrapper. Once again didn't seem too fresh. The rapper seemed a bit stale and tough.

Overall not one of the best experiences we've had food wise. Like I said service was perfect and the engine and helped us was exceptional. Just don't think will be going back even for happy hour specials."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for date night. We always have good service and food. 

The egg rolls were not to my liking, but everything else was excellent. Ordered the Miso Chicken dish, with the Mandarin Key Lime Bar for desert. Usually order the  lettuce wraps and would highly recommend that dish. The excellent service added to the enjoyment of the evening.

It is also nice to know we are supporting an Arizona based restaurant chain."}
{"text":"Very happy with the meal. The service was great. I always have a nice time here. Looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"I had the one of the worst meals of my life there last night.  Got there about 8:30 and the place was almost empty.  The hostess attempted to seat my wife and I next to a couple of men even though there were plenty of empty tables that offered privacy.  We noticed that not only was the piped in music not appropriate for a restaurant, but the sound system sounded like it came from a Japanese transistor radio from 1962.  The waiter was brand new and in training, but he tried hard.  We each ordered a draft beer ($6.00 x 2) which came with no head, completely flat and semi warm.  My wife ordered the Scallops dish ($18.95 ) which came out stringy, salty and tasting like they had been cooked the day before.  The rice was totally tasteless.  I ordered the Beef Sichuan ($15.95) .  It was literally inedible. Small strings of deep fried salty beef jerky that if I had eaten them would have ripped my fillings from my teeth, this came with what appeared to be green onion stalks and some other type of vegetable. I told the waiter the meal was miserable, but I wasn't looking for a free dish (this was stupid on my part, I shouldn't have paid for it).  The waiter came back with my bill and said because of the problem they would give me  a coupon for free Dim Sum or a \"Small Dish\"  the next time I came in. Needless to say I left the coupon on the table.  Now I remember why I stopped going to PF Chang's."}
{"text":"Decent food. Service was good when I arrived around 8:15 but around 9, bar began to fill up and it was impossible to get someone to slow down. When someone did stop by to pick up my card, I had to chase him down the bar to ask for some tea. He brought me a to go box. I said no I would like to go cup of tea. He brought me a mug of hot water. Asked a third time, I finally got him to slow down and listen. But attitude was unnecessary...felt like I was inconveniencing him asking for something else. No one pre bussed my plates. I had to move them around Tetris-style to sign my credit card slip. May want to rethink late night schedule as it was definitely apparent that they need more bartenders during late night to prevent the rushing and impatience with people tipping you. But food quality was good and service I received for first half of my visit was very nice, helpful and courteous."}
{"text":"Obviously it's a fancy Panda Express. All Americanized but let's get to the point. When I walked in, the servers were unprofessional and ignored me for a minute. That reduces a star. The server also handed me the menu and didn't say anything. Although the waiter was kind, that's okay for now.

Sesame cucumber- under was soy sauce.. Really salty...

My entrees came and it tasted like the plates have been sitting there for seven minutes. Outside was warm/murky inside was a little hotter.

I ordered lo mein (chicken fried noodles) and coconut veggie curry.


Best was the curry but kinda salty and they give you a bowl of rice. With tips, Total was forty dollars. Blah."}
{"text":"Not sure why it has a low star review from others! We had a really nice big dinner tonight. Hadn't been in a while and were very happy. Staff was helpful and friendly and food was delicious. No issues!"}
{"text":"Let's put the food aside here for a moment.  Let's talk about customer service for a moment.  Earlier this week, I had the misfortune of dining at the Waterfront P.F. Changs.  It was bitter cold outside. Their food is usually good, so my husband and I ducked in to get a bite before we went to the movies.  We were seated and we quickly ordered because we wanted to make our show time.  I didn't notice it at first, but I soon realized that it was cold in the restaurant. I asked about the heat and I was told that there was no heat - that it had broken earlier that day.  I asked our server why they hadn't mentioned this when we came in.  Well, I already know the answer to that - we would have turned around a gone somewhere else.  Then the manager came over and apologized.  I mentioned to him that it might have been nice to be warned about the heat (as I sat there in my coat).  He seemed to agree with me, but still allowed at least another 20 people enter the restaurant without saying a word to them. Not one word. Oh, he did offer me some dessert. That's what they usually do when someone has f**ked up.  In this case it didn't matter.  I quickly ate and left to make my movie.  This is the second bad experience I've had at this particular location.  Last time I was there, the floor was pretty dirty which always makes me nervous.  What does the kitchen look like?  I'm not against P.F. Chang's because it is a chain I have gone to in other states and have always liked the food.  This location needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"PF Chang I love your decor, and your complimentary valet! Your service is pretty nice as well, unintrusive, informative, and friendly. However your food seems to be lacking something for me, and the prices aren't that cool either.

When we walked in we were seated promptly in a nice section. It's such a nice restaurant, but for the quality of food you get for the price it's woefully lacking. I guess what you're really paying for is location and service because both are top notch. We ordered a bunch of menu items and I seriously can't remember my meal there. Stuff tends to be either too salty or too bland, and tastes pretty much the same.

I really wanted to like this place, but I don't think I'll be back. When I'm in the mood for some americanized Chinese I think I'll just stick to the takeout place for tastier food at half the price."}
{"text":"Experiences here have definitely varied in quality, but tonight's service, in addition to their always consistent food, was phenomenal. It's not always easy to eat out with a baby, but AJ was attentive, quick, and engaging. We will definitely be back to sit in his section again."}
{"text":"Pretty Good Stuff!

PROS:
Nice bar area
Cool ambiance
nice dishes with good flavors

CONS:
Pricey for \"just chinese food\"
typically a rather long wait, especially on weekends.
Very difficult to even get noticed by the bartenders once its busy at the bar area.

Suggestions:
Lettuce Wraps (just get this as you meal!  LOL)
Fat Cat Martini (OMG, YUMMMMM!)
Pot Stickers"}
{"text":"Food was ok I can't really complain. Just be aware food could take a while because they are pretty busy being on the strip. Our food took about 40 mins to come out but the waiter kept us informed of the situation. The bill can add up fairly quick. I spent $125 for  2 drinks,2 main entrées and 2 appetizers. I think this place is a tad bit overpriced but food was decent."}
{"text":"First time to this PF Chang in Henderson. 
Cosy ambiance like all PF Chang' restaurant.
We got a booth quickly.
The waiter took our drinks order right away
5mns later he came back to get our food order.
we ordered Salad wrap and ahi tuna (appetizers) You can't go wrong with it: Light, refreshing 
We picked Mongolian beef, Singapore chicken and chicken khamphao with brown rice.
my Mongolian beef was too cooked and crispy on the edge of my pieces of beef :( little too salty
Chicken khamphao was \"plain\". The only dish that came up great was the Singapore chicken. it has a kick of spiciness.
We went to PF Chang to catch up with a friend we haven't seen for some time.
We were enjoying our time together and our meal, the waiter came asking if we wanted to place an order for dessert... hmmm we are still eating....
I told him we will see once we finish dinner.
10mns later he came back with our check, he added \"take your time\"! Sure!!!!
I think he came 2 more time see if i placed my credit card for payment like he was in a hurry for us to leave the restaurant... 
I was so annoyed that I told him I would let him know once we are ready to pay and leave...

No dessert, no coffee tonight LOL, might not come back to this PF Chang location either ..."}
{"text":"Not sure why I remembered this place being better in the past, but our experience last night as far as food goes was NOT good. Bland, bland is the word. Ordered their calamari, honey glazed chicken, and long-life lo-mein and all of it was lacking flavor. I had to ask for some chili paste on the side just to satisfy my palate. Don't get me wrong, the service and atmosphere was great. However, for $15-$20+ a dish ... they did absolutely did not deliver. Sorry P.F. Changs, we will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Fifteen minutes after being seated, still no sign of the server. I called the restaurant's phone number and asked the receptionist to send a server.. My mother asked for water with no ice, Ketowie, the server brought two ice waters. The food was served cold and the waiter was no where in sight. I called again and Mara, said she was coming to my table. By the time she came to the table, Ketowie, had picked up the food to remake the meal. Another server dropped off the meal, the meal wasn't fully cooked. When I tried to cut it the knife wouldn't go through because it was undercooked. Again, Ketowie, was no where to be found. I called the restaurant again, asked that they send a supervisor to table 24. I was shocked when the manager asked if I tried to cut the other pieces to see if they were cooked. Maybe he thoughtI should only eat the food that was cooked and leave the rest of the uncooked food... what a waste of my time and patience.
Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for my birthday since I had been wanting to come for a while. Usually we have a great experience but this time it was the worst. First when our waitress came she doesn't offer to take our drink order she assumes we just want water I know I have a big family but we're going out for a nice dinner why wouldn't we want drinks or a least ask us if we did I had to pretty much do her job and go around the table asking everyone what they wanted to drink and this went on the whole dinner. I had to flag her down to order appetizers and again for our dinner. We had to ask for the sauces they usually bring before you're dinner And make to your liking she brought in little containers. And to top it off it was my birthday so my husband tried to get her to bring out a special treat for me and she brought out chocolate cake and later my husband told me when we left he kept telling her if there was something else she bring because I don't like chocolate cake but she said all she could do was add some ice cream to it he did said that was fine because he thought like most places that it would be complimentary but no she charged us almost 15$ for something we didn't even want and there were other desserts we could have got since we paid for it anyways but it was just how horrible of a waitress she was and how horrible she made this dinner be. Not sure will be going back ever again. But I will say the food was delish and that is the one star is for."}

{"text":"If you like overprice Chinese food come to PF chang's!  if you want good Chinese food go somewhere else.  Every time I think this place will get better, but $15+ fried rice or any lunch item is just too much for bland tasting Chinese food."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the shrimp dumplings and the sauce that comes with it!!! P.F. used to be on DoorDash but it's no longer there. So I have to make the trek to Phillips Place (so worth it) to get my fix. #DumplingAddict"}
{"text":"Seriously??? We were in PF Chang and ordered sushi along with the other dishes and guess what, we found a small cockroach alive walking in between our sushi dish. How is that feeling??? We immediately left the place and didn't paid for our appetizer but no matter what that was a disaster and so horrifying when you just think what's happening in their kitchen!"}
{"text":"PF Changs was one of the first restaurant I enjoyed when I first moved here in the valley.  So, for old time sakes...I go.

Never had bad service nor bad food at this location.  They were the only ones to accomodate a big group (24) in Old Town Scottsdale without having to book with an event planner.  We also ordered from the regular menu instead of choosing between chicken or fish, beef or pork, etc.  We love the calamari, walnut shrimp, honey scallops and chicken lettuce wrap.  Their banana lumpia dessert satisfied the sweet toofers .  It's all good,  don't come here for authenticity, coz it ain't."}
{"text":"At the PF and this places really gets crowded. I guess it's a reliable relatively ow cost option among all of the big spends that surround it. At the end, we enjoyed good potstickers, great lettuce wraps, fried rice and moshu chicken."}
{"text":"Any trip to PF Chang's should be under protest. The hot and sour soup was just a bowl of saltwater, the seared tuna salad was as unimpressive as it was unoriginal. I was kind of hoping that I'd finally have an experience there that didn't suck; nope."}
{"text":"A good place to grab lunch/dinner before/after movies! I tried signature lo mein and wonton soup and both of them tasted great."}
{"text":"the food tastes the same, too salty.
and the waiting time for the food is very long.
not worth the wait and for the price hmmmm i can say not worth it.
for me i fee like i went to a higher end version of panda express"}
{"text":"We've visited this specific restaurant countless times with delight, but this visit was subpar. From dry Kung Pao Chicken to a disappearing waiter, our experience was poor. Are you losing your touch, PF?"}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese food, but I will say, if you have a large group and need a reservation, this place will give you the least hassle. I called countless places, and everyone wanted a minimum food and beverage amount of unreasonable amounts. We've defaulted to PF Changs for a large group of 30+ on several occasions, and I can say they've never let us down. 

The food is always flowing, and when you do the group menu, you definitely get a lot of food. The servers for the most part are good. A bit of a delay with drinks as only one bartender in the upstairs making drinks for the entire group. 

Nothing I've tried here has blown me away, but it wasn't disappointing either. Just average, but I give them 4 stars due to convenience of booking, value, and service."}
{"text":"The last time I ate at P.F. Changs (before this location) was in Rockville, Maryland at the White Flint Mall.  As always, I enjoyed my meal at this chain.  I was quite shocked when I ate at the Superstition location last weekend...

The dining area is quite small compared to every other P.F. Changs I have ever visited.  Seating is NOT intimate - it feels more like a cafeteria or an (ack!) Sizzler or something.  The lights are not dimmed like they usually are at a P.F. Changs.  The food was desperately lacking in quality.  It has gone so far downhill that it is no longer recognizable to my taste buds.  I ordered the coconut curry vegetables.  They were so stingy with the sauce that my meal was dry.  I was able to scoop up a little at the very bottom, but it hardly resembled the meal I once knew.  While I am sure most restaurant vegetables are actually previously frozen, it shouldn't be so obvious.  I could have gone to the grocery store, purchased a bag of frozen veggies, steamed them in my microwave and saved myself a lot of money.

Since my meal was dry, I was very thirsty.  My waitress seemed annoyed that I needed a refill.  Half way through my meal, she looked at my empty glass and asked, \"Do you want another coke?\"  Hmmmmm... what do you think?

That night, after returning home, I realized we had left an expensive designer item belonging to my baby.  I called to ask if it had been found or if anyone had turned it in.  I was told, \"Call back tomorrow, we are really busy right now.\"  Well, I am ever so sorry to have inconvenienced you.  I guess that since my meal had already been paid for, there was no need provide me with decent customer service.  We returned two days later in person and, naturally, the designer item was nowhere to be found.  Perhaps if the young man on the telephone would have been willing to help me when I called, the item may have been recovered before it was stolen.  :("}
{"text":"Our server Kyle was great, no complaints there. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but the food is incredibly terrible. Even my 15 year old boy who devours most anything agrees. Everything is smothered in oil (and not the good kind). Even the dipping sauces were bad. I've never had a bad spring roll until tonight, huge chunks of mushrooms/squash? Couldn't tell, but they were rubbery, I very ungraciously spit them out. I didn't even eat half of my food and my belly did not feel good. Also ordered a coconut drink, awful, waaaay too sweet. Goodyear & Avondale have so few dining options, besides chain restaurants, too bad!"}
{"text":"This place has great Chinese food along with one of the best managers MIKE F! So thoughtful and such great customer service!!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I am here now and the service is very bad. Very young people with poor attitudes and for everything we have to ask them to come over. I've been here 30 minutes and still do not have a napkin. We have left our seat four times and they are just looking at us and not waiting on us. Bad attitudes as well. The food is okay."}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant but I must say I was a little disappointed from all of the comments I have read about it. The location was great but the parking was a little frustrating...not enough. The atmosphere was good but again, it was cold on the inside.  The food was great and the waitress was friendly. We entered into the restaurant and had to wait about ten minutes before being seated but other than that it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Had Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Pork Fried Dumplings for appetizer and were incredible. Had Sweet and Sour Soup and Changs Spicy Chicken with Chicken Fried Rice. Portions were huge but was so good we all finished everything! Prices are good for what you get!  Service was great!"}
{"text":"Dead Roach on the Bamboo on my steam dumpling basket. I got up and left. This is the only time i've gotten up and left besides an hour wait at Denny's.  F'ing gross!!"}
{"text":"Slow service, cold/luke warm food.

I used to like going to P.F. Chang's, even though it costs a lot more for a slight variation on Chinese food (one of the variations being smaller portions).

I ordered right in the middle of the safe zone - I got the customer favorite: Mongolian Beef.  This should have been an easy slam dunk for P.F. Chang's.

The waiter apologized three times for the delay in our food preparation.  One apology is polite, more than that is an indictment that you don't have your act together.

We also go the pad Thai and the appetizer that comes loose that you roll up and eat in lettuce.  The appetizer tasted like it had been burned - sitting too long on a grill that was too hot.  It had a faint taste of burnt wood, gas, charcoal - something smokey like when you burn something.

I am not going back here because the food wasn't hot, the service was slow, and our cold food tasted burned (if it is burned it should at least be hot), and we had to send back plates and flatware because it was still dirty.  Gross on all fronts.

Aside from all these serious violations everything else was fine: our table didn't wobble.

I had to wait so long to be seated I think only Stockholm syndrome is keeping me from giving this P.F. Chang's a 1 star.  Other locations I would say average 3 stars, this place is really a 1.6 so I rounded up.

I reread my own review and kicked myself - this was a 1!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and awesome flavorful dishes here ! I had the chicken lo mien and it was delicious ! It's not your regular Chinese restraunt where your wondering if the quality of meat is good or old or not. PF always has great dishes and you can tell it's all fresh !"}
{"text":"Went with the entire family here because they wanted to go.  I haven't really cared about this place in a long time because the sodium will kill you the amount they put in their food.

Anyway, we ate family style with the tempura green beans - nice, easy to pull the crust off of and wow! that dipping sauce will clear your sinuses in a minute!  Had the lettuce cups which were good and the lo mein.  

My niece had this huge slice of chocolate cake which had most of the table in a chocolate high and I made off with most of the fortune cookies (which I found to be very tasty - who knew!)

Our server was great, the place was packing that evening but what was cool was sitting outside waiting for our table at a gas fire pit.  PFC's isn't my thing but if you like it then this place will fit your needs."}
{"text":"This is the worst place to come and eat!!!!! One has to complain to get seated a guest had just arrived complained to the hostess and got seated right away, I waited over an hour!!!!  Went to hostess but didn't help at all!!!!!"}
{"text":"I will never go to this PF Changs ever again! I wish I could give this place a negative 3 stars.

I ordered online for \"curbside pickup\" for the first time the other day. Once I got there I was totally confused, there was only one sign directing you to the pickup area and after that you're on your own. I drove around twice until I decided to just park in front. 

Now I don't usually order out a lot but I thought curbside pickup meant that you're order would be brought right out to your car. Nope not the case here. After 10 minutes I call and let them know I was there to pick up my order. The hostess rushes me off the phone saying \"I'll tell someone you're here,\" and hangs up the phone. Another 10 minutes go by and still nothing. I decide to go in and the hostess laughs it off and says \"Oh I told them you were here a while ago, just stand by the bar they'll get to you.\" Mind blown, I'm am more than over the situation at this point and I wait for my order to come. A few moments later it does and I get home only to find none of the condiments, plate settings and extras that I included in my order online are in my bag.

Overall the food was subpar and cold because of the extra 25 min wait time added because of their terrible service. I will gladly drive over to Planet Hollywood for my next PF Chang fix."}
{"text":"Decent food, good service, mediocre hostess. If you are prone to high blood pressure, you may want to be careful. Menu items are often salty. I love the pina colada drink. They use their yummy pineapple coconut ice cream in it. Hot n sour was just right. Crab wontons strangely tasted fishy at this location. Plenty of seating inside and the bar looks warm and relaxing."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food. Overpriced. Typical chain. The service was good considering we arrived close to closing time. The decor was beautiful, but it'd be great if a chain like this would play traditional Chinese music and not cheesy 80s/early 90s music for my dining pleasure."}
{"text":"Went to Henderson location last night for dinner. Food was great, service from our waiter, Anthony, was the best. My only complaint was that the restaurant was not as clean as it use to be. Last time there was about one year ago. We were seated and there were crumbs on our chairs from the previous group, and the floor was quite dirty as well. Of course I will go back because of the food and service but I wish it was a little more kept up as far as cleanliness in general.

Thanks Anthony for awesome service.

{"text":"I have been to this location many times for meals and each time I have a good experience. Typical P F Changs quality food and good service. The last time I was there we got there very late and even though they would be closing in a short period of time we were seated and served with cheerful and attentive service. There was no rushing us out the door and no telling us we could not have a particular item because they were about to close.

I recommend this place for the food and service."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was super fast. We had to wait about 20 minutes even at 8:30 a night. Super packed on the weekend. Drinks are on the higher range."}
{"text":"Food was yummmmy! I loved the almond chicken! One order is definetely big enough to share! My husband and I ended up sharing almond chicken and that lettuce wrap stuff... it was enough to fill us. Waiter was kinda... eh Okay. He wasnt that great, and took forever to bring us our check. We asked for our check and then 10 mins later... still no check! 20 mins later... still sitting there. Well, 30 mins later.. finally!! overall, good food!"}
{"text":"Not one on the top of my list, but they are consistently good.  They switch up the specialty drinks often so always a pleasant surprise and an opportunity to try something different."}
{"text":"Ate here Sunday with my family. One of our favorites is the salt and pepper calamari which has never disappointed.  Tried the sushi for the first time.  Won't do that again.  It was okay, but I've had better.  Everything else we've ever eaten here has been delicious.  Our server was super sweet but also super slow.  The manager personally apologized.  Customer service will keep me coming back to a restaurant any time.  We'll be back, maybe she'll have gotten the swing of things."}
{"text":"I will never order anything other than orange peel chicken at any PF. When it's this good- WHY try anything else. Comes w rice. NOT on happy hour."}
{"text":"I order takeout. During my last order, I mentioned to the takeout person my lo mein was gummy and overcooked. She said it might possibly be because of the ventilation for the Togo containers. She told me that she'd mention it to the chef. And boy did she. This time my food was perfect. And the gentleman that drop it off verbalized everything I was concerned about. I RECEIVED EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. You can tell they value there customers by the line of communication and sincerely appreciate it. Thanks."}
{"text":"Great dining experience. Good menu options. Nice interior, spacious, good views. Our waiter Tom was exceptional, making sure the order was placed right, since I have special dietary needs. Will come back again."}

{"text":"First time here and it was awesome! I had the sesame chicken, and it's some of the best I've had! I'm giving 5 stars mostly because of our server I believe his name was like Wilson.. I loved his energy, and he was very attentive! I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Dining alone is fun. Stopped by for dinner around 6pm, busy but not bad. Hostesses were friendly and helpful. I was seated by the window, great view. Ordered Sangria and chicken pad thai. Food was delicious and the sangria was absolutely great. Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"If I had to pick my very favorite chain restaurant, it would be PF Chang's.  I'm aware that it's not authentic, but that doesn't mean it's not delicious.

We stopped by after some shopping in the area on a snowy Friday, and were able to get a table pretty quickly.  The hostess and server were both friendly.  My husband enjoyed a glass of sake, and I had a mai tai that turned out to be delicious.  We split an order of lettuce wraps as an appetizer; they don't custom-make your sauce any more which is disappointing, but they did happily provide us with chili paste and hot mustard to doctor it up ourselves.  His Chang's Spicy Chicken (extra spicy) turned out great, and provided the extra requested heat.  My Orange Peel Shrimp were as good as I'd remembered-- perhaps better because they have some fresh orange slices included as well.  We also ordered a Great Wall of  Chocolate.  If you like  chocolate cake at all, you'll love this one.

PF Chang's consistently provides good Chinese in a trendy (but still casual) atmosphere at a decent price, and I'm always a fan."}
{"text":"Long been an absolute dine in favorite of mine and my family for years but JUST SAY NO to their curb side takeout. The ordering process was expectedly flawless but the food was horrible. I'm not sure if it had been sitting out but I arrived at 3:16p after being quoted a 3:15p pick up time.

I ordered Mongolian  beef with the excitement of putting the white rice  in it to soak up all of the juicy sweet sauce and was bummed to find that the rice was laying in a deserted sea of just beef  and green onions. I can only imagine the rice's disappointment that it would not live up to its full potential of soaking up deliciousness. Instead the rice was pushed to the side like an unwanted one night stand.
The shrimp  fried rice tasted like it had seen better times but was forced to hang out in the red light district (heat lamp) before being reheated and deviously pawned off as new. There is no way that was fresh fried rice. 

I also ordered Kung Pao Chicken for my husband who can be somewhat of a Changs hater so I don't always trust his opinion but today he was right. Never a fun moment for a wife to admit that her husband is right. I took a bite and it too was dry and devoid of any sauce. 

I think today Changs made itself look like Panda, maybe even worse."}
{"text":"We had a party of 7 on Wednesday night to celebrate 2 birthdays.  Our server, Michael, was very good.  The 7 meals, though, were just OK.  Nobody said their meal was great.  I had the Mongolian Beef and the portion was small and the meat was like beef jerky.  I haven't been to Changs in a while, but I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"We were in a party of 16, and they were out of lobster.   Who does that?  6 pm on a Thursday night! That screams poor management!"}
{"text":"Veg lettuce wraps, coconut curry vegetables, sze chuan asparagus....,"}
{"text":"The food was as expected for any PF Changs. The service was OK. Long waits for drink refills and the check. Food runner brought 2 plates for 3 people. It was happy hour so they were busy. The patio is nice. *vegetarian recommendation* : the coconut curry vegetables with white rice and veggie lettuce wraps are awesome. My carnivore mother even reluctantly enjoyed the wraps."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today and Tommy was our server. He was super nice and kept on top of our refills the entire time.

Service and food: 5*
I wasn't extremely hungry but I chose to order the chili-garlic green beans market side as an appetizer and their new Hokkien Street Noodles for my main course. 
The green beans were in my surprise extremely flavorful and not as spicy as expected. They were wok fried to perfection with a light crunch. 
The street noodles were ok. I enjoyed them enough to eat the majority of it, but I will probably opt out next visit. They had good flavor and I small bite of spice. There was a combination of chicken, shrimp, egg, onion and julienned vegetables in a light curry sauce. 

Restaurant: 3*
Walking up to the door you see nothing but dying plants and over grown weeds. The waiting area was clean but when we were sat the booths were cracked and ripped. Every time I would move I would get scratched by my seat. Small details, especially simple garden work makes a negative impression. And with the booths, I know furniture is expensive, but I was extremely uncomfortable during my meal and I probably won't come back to this location until it gets fixed."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's is ... well, P.F. Chang's.  The plaster horse that's in front of every single chain signifies that you've entered the asian fusion place of champions.   The interior is like every other P.F. Chang's and the food also is.... same.

That in itself would probably rank itself in a 4 star category if you're not going down to Chinatown for the real thang.

However, the one star deduction came from the terrible misplacement of their Curb-side service.  First, curb-side usually designates that someone will probably come out to take your order or what not.   Instead, this location decided to place the signage out behind their dumpster area.  And there's no video camera or anything so no one comes out to meet you or bring your food.  You still have to head over to the front entrance and get your food from the bar area.

Second, they blocked off the sidewalk with their outdoor patio gate.  So you'll walk the long way around to get to-go food.  It's not only an afterthought for curb-side service, it's a terrible location and there's not a dedicated area for it.  If you're going to do it, do it right.  I'd probably take pointers from Darden's (Outback/Carrabba's) who's had a pickup window/door for a while and they even re-implemented their areas in older venues.

I would probably suggest that they re-do this with the parking that's facing the entrance to make this a more viable solution.  Picking up to-go food at the bar is so 1990s."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday with a friend and it was so yummy! Started out with chicken lettuce wraps and it was totally hitting the hungry spot! Lol. Tried chicken lettuce wrap at my places but this place is one of my fave. Their wonton shop is also full of chicken chunks and shrimps as well... which is different bc you don't normally get all that in a wonton soup bowl.  By the time we ate the lettuce wraps and our soups, we were almost full. LOVE the way their Mongolian beef is made here and my friend had the crispy honey shrimp and it was so yummy as well. Definitely will be back because this place is clean, service is quick, food is delicious, and the price isn't so bad either."}
{"text":"I come here about twice maybe three times a month.  Always good service and even better food! The Mongolian beef is the BEST! I highly recommend this particular p.f. Chang's! Ohooo and they have a great happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"My first time at PF Changs was at this location. This was also my last time at a PF Changs. It's not because they had terrible service, or bad food; it was because they just...didn't have anything special. 

I'm a die hard Pei Wei fan, and quite honestly, I feel as though PF Changs is just  an overpriced, watered-down version of Pei Wei. I felt like the portions were small and the flavor just wasn't there. I would much rather get an Orange Peel Signature Dish to-go at Pei Wei and enjoy an afternoon lunch in the park."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here a lot, and it's always great, and great service...crispy honey chicken is the best and their egg drop soup!!! I just wish they had a better dessert selection"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. I love the chicken with black bean sauce so of course I don't see it in the menu anymore. Other than that I love this place."}
{"text":"To Bri G,
I'm surprised that management hasn't made you take down your yelp review yet. Your review not only makes this pf changs location look bad but it also justifies our claim of how rude you were to us. Yelp is for guest to write about their personal experience. Who are you to decide how we felt about our experience? 
I work in the food industry, all of my friends that night work in customer service. Why the hell would we come into a restaurant \"wanting a bad experience\" ? We aren't looking for anything in return, we are just trying to warn future guest about your horrible customer service. You were rude all night, and you did not attend to us at all. The busser was more of a server to us then you. Yeah I get it, half of us showed up late, but you could of at least tried to hide your aggravation. 
If someone insist on boxing there own food, LET THEM. If someone doesn't want 11 different cups on the table, TAKE THE CUPS AWAY. If someone looks like there done eating, ASK BEFORE YOU TAKE THERE PLATE AWAY. There's so many things you could of done to make our experience pleasant, but you were in a rush and cared more about your other tables then us since you saw us as \"inconsiderate kids\". And to top it off you wrote the 20% tip on the top, how unprofessional can you get. Since I work in the food industry I always tip over 20% since I know the servers need to tip out the host and bussers. But you didn't deserve that. 
However I feel like everyone is entitled to their own opinion, if not I would run around the internet calling you liar and a horrible server, oh wait..."}
{"text":"PF Chang's ain't bad.  Granted, it's not the best food I've ever had but there is a lot to like about this chain and the food IS of good quality.

I like the following:

1.  The lunch bowls are really inexpensive.  You can get a decent lunch bowl and soup for like 8 bucks ($7.95 to be precise).  That's pretty cheap, man.  I mean, come on.  8 bucks rarely even buys you a 12-pack of beer anymore.

2.  The to-go containers are awesome.  I bicycle around and, to date, no hot soup has spilled down my back.  It snaps together and, VOILA, you're good to go.

3.  Overall, it's pretty fast.  If you work close to a PF Chang's, call a little bit in advance, get it to go and, man, you're set.

Sometimes the people who work at this location think too highly of me and don't realize I'm a fatass.  I'll order my food, the lunch deal and sometimes two spring rolls and they'll give me two forks and two fortune cookies (actually I got three fortune cookies today).  They either think I'm ordering for two or that I need two forks to shovel the food into my mouth twice as fast.  If I were ambidextrous, I so would.

Celebrity sighting!  I saw Frankie Muniz outside of this location, too.  I looked at him as he walked by and I was like, \"Is that the kid from Malcolm in the Middle?\"  I cocked my head like a dog who heard a whistle and he looked a little panicked, like he thought, \"Ah shit.  This guy knows who I am.\"  I didn't say anything cause he was with his chick and I had to fart.  

But, hey, Frankie, that sweaty guy who had to fart used to watch your show when he was in school."}
{"text":"Creative and excellent food, high quality in every location I've been. I trust the food preparation and servers to provide top quality."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. The service and atmosphere were fine, but the food was just meh. I think there was chicken in my wonton soup, which seemed odd. The soup was fine, nothing special. The lo mein noodles were okay, but tasted almost like they were reheated. The chicken from the Chang's spicy chicken was okay, but it looked and tasted like it was just some frozen chicken bites thrown around in some sauce. Overall, not terrible, but I don't know if I'll ever feel compelled to go back."}
{"text":"If you look at other reviews you will see that I am a very positive person, but tonight was an utter disaster!!  We sat at the bar and the female bartender  was miserable. We ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did.  She spent 20 minutes sending text messages and took 3 smoke brakes in one hour while our drinks were empty. We ordered appetizers and they never came out.  She actually brought us our check and we never got our food. By the way we were the only people at the bar.  Finally a bus boy brought us our food after we payed. We payed before our food came because we thought our table was ready. We finally got seated by the windows. Do not sit by the windows because it was very cold. We ordered our dinner and drinks and guess what no drinks. After our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot. Nothing was comped and no manager was available. This PF Changs needs new management!! We will never return. I will give it 2 stars because the food was great, but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostess to waiters to bartenders. Steer clear until changes are made. It's not worth the headache."}
{"text":"For a chain eatery in Sin City this place is great.  Consistently good food; we had lettuce wraps, hot & sour soup, Honey Chicken & Sesame Chicken both with brown rice.  All were delicious.  Our server, Matt, was super attentive and refilled out water and beers without us having to ask.  2 rounds of booze and all that food was $59.  Hell, i lost $100 on blackjack 3 minutes before we decided to eat there.  Check them out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wir waren sehr überrascht, dass wir ohne Probleme auf dem Strip einen Tisch auf der Patio an einem Freitag Abend bekommen haben, aber da zeigte sich schon der durchweg freundliche und aufmerksame Service. Die Lage ist super - man kann das verrückte Treiben auf dem Strip beobachten und Spass haben. 
Das Essen war sehr lecker - der Salat war frisch und es gab viele Saucen zur Auswahl. Ich habe dann nach dem Essen noch einen Moscow Mule getrunken - dafür gibt es einen Stern Abzug - der Barkeeper kennt das Rezept nicht oder hat bewusst die Zutaten vergesesen - im Grunde war es Eiswasser mit etwas Gurkengeschmack. Also: lasst die Finger von den Cocktails und geniesst das Essen und die Lage :)"}
{"text":"Food was great like always when eating at p f changs. Lettuce wraps are to die for. At this particular place we were told 25-30 min wait time ; after an hour we were finally seated only to order and then the server forget our waters after bringing out app and then bringing out the wrong order of main entree for half the party. I expected some type of comp but nothing was offered so I mentioned how I felt it might be least they could do. They decided to not comp the entree they messed up on but a 12.50 app. We received proper attention and again food was great don't let this discourage you however have plenty of time available."}
{"text":"Definitely the best choice of eating chinese food in the city where you have limited good Asian food around. The Singapore street noodle (curry noodle) is always been my favorite and the crab wonton is just a great appetizer to start! I also like their orange beef! Definitely worth to eat for!"}
{"text":"I have friends that love, love, love P.F. Chang's... I've tried it three times, and have never been impressed... While they have vegetarian items on the menu, I think they just don't pay a whole lot of attention to the taste in their meals.  I've had a couple of versions of tofu and vegetables, and while you can't go too wrong with fried tofu, the sauces were just flavorless... With vegetarian meals, spices and flavor is essential... Few folks want to pay $14 for a pile of steamed veggies in a barely flavored goo... 

On the flip side, my friends love their Orange Chicken, and cream cheese wontons (which I agree are awesome, but fried dough and cream cheese is always awesome).  I've never had anything here that made me say \"I can't wait to come back and have this again\", so I say \"meh\"."}
{"text":"FYI they just got rid of the dinner for two combo specials. As if there could possibly be another reason to come here. We have a friend who is always celebrating something and wants to meet here...believe me, we do not come here voluntarily. 

The service is so bad I'm sure they would be out of business if their customer base wasn't braindead suburbanites who have chains as favorite restaurants. Five stars, for the equivalent of sugar soaked Americanized fake Asian food? Ok."}
{"text":"I have memories of this chain from years ago when it was the fancy place to enjoy some pretty good Chinese food. That was before I discovered my favorite mom and pop restaurants. Obviously, it's been a while since I visited a P.F. Chang's and things have changed.

It's unfortunate for me that I've enjoyed better experiences at their sister restaurant (Pei Wei), but that's still fortunate for the parent company. At Pei Wei, the price and quality are spot on. For what was paid for our most recent meal, the quality at P.F. Chang's needs to step it up.

The atmosphere is still unique and sets a standard for everyone else. However, the food quality, particularly the plating and service, needs some work. And apparently, the definition of \"Family Style\" portions has changed.

My Mongolian Beef was good but just barely. At least they were willing to add some heat to it. I've always believed this entree should be spicy. Still, I hate to compare the flavor of my dish to beef jerky, but my meal tasted like tender Teriyaki Jack Links.

Coupled with some sloppy plating (see the photos) and the abrupt manner in which they were literally dropped off, I can't see myself visiting here again."}
{"text":"I love this P.F. Changs! The staff is very professional and they do go the extra mile! I had just a little bit of my meal left to box up and take home and my server offered to throw some extra brown rice in there for me so I could have a complete meal! The manager stopped by to greet us which I always apprieciate. 
Kung Pao Scallops are great!
Calamari is really tasty!
Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Very good food the pan fried pork dumplings are very good they usually choke with sauce no dipping sauce this time around. 
Shrimp & lobster fried rice is very good & very generous, huge portion. 
Egg drop soup is very good. They serve in cup or bowl portions.
Red wine sangria I do not recommend at all. Rather call it a glass of wine cause that it's all you taste.
The outdoor seating right on the strip is very good place to people watch, all sorts of characters. 
You can pay with total rewards but they DO NOT GIVE POINTS."}
{"text":"We're regulars at PF Changs we love this place can't get enough of their spicy chicken soup give me to open up some branches in Canada"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had the worst experience at PF Chang's. I had never been before but we had a gift card and wanted to try it out. I ordered the surf and turf which was way over priced for what you got. The menu said it came with filet mignon, lobster, shrimp, asparagus, and mushrooms. The steak was over cooked and all cut up, the lobster and shrimp were fried, and the asparagus was hard. While I was eating I noticed one of the pieces of shrimp was not deveined and still had its poop running down its back. I was immediately grossed out and lost my appetite. We told our waitress Brittany and she basically blew me off and didn't care. We thought she might have taken off one of our appetizers at least but she didn't. I can definitely say that I will not be returning to PF Chang's."}
{"text":"Maybe it's me.  Maybe it was just bad luck.  But I've gotta say, our last (and unfortunately it will probably be exactly that) visit to PF Chang's was just horrible.  Service was slow as always, mainly because the place is typically packed with people.  No problem.  We weren't in a hurry and patiently waited the 30 minutes necessary to get a table.  Our server was attentive and had a fun attitude, so no problem there either.  

It was the food that was just unacceptable.  Overpriced for sure, but poorly prepared too.  Orange Peel Chicken was soggy and tasted like it was a three-day old left-over pulled from fridge and reheated in a microwave (really).  My son ordered the salmon and we had to send it back not once, but twice due to being undercooked.  The center was literally raw both times.  The last straw was when one of the junior \"managers\" came to the table to say that, \"We cook the salmon that way on purpose.\"  Really?  As if it was sushi?  Wow.  

Sorry guys, you are just not worth it."}
{"text":"My facorite location, after a few days non stop drinking in Vegas, I really need salty food to absorb leftover alcohol in me to feel slightly better...I've always liked the decor and seatings here.

The hangover cure food I usually like to order: 
Chang's vegetarian lettuce wraps, made with tofu: so yummy, no matter how hangover I am, I still need veggies ;p 

Hot & Sour soup, chicken, tofu, bamboo shoots, egg & mushrooms, balanced with hot white pepper and vinegar: this is a MUST for hangover! Always makes me much better.... Very delicious

Pepper steak, marinated flank steak tossed with yellow onion, red & green peppers in a garlic and black pepper sauce: hubby's favorite

Hunan-style hot fish, Crispy slices of tilapia in a tangy, spicy sauce with stir- fried vegetables: Spicy spicy spicy, only way for bad hangover! 

I like all those dishes with Taingtao beer, service is always good. Funny I like Americanized Chinese food much better than authentic Chinese food, I like salty sometime for some reasons, but never greasy and oily, P.F.Chang food is salty without greasy, just what I need & love sometime! ;p"}
{"text":"My husband loves PF Changs and I just like it.  I feel it is not a very good value, but I do love the ambiance.  We've Eaten in and ordered takeout.  I would recommend their happy hour.  I really enjoy getting to enjoy a variety of foods and I feel their happy hour is a fun way to do so.  Their drinks are always strong.  That being said, last night I had the chicken satay and the chicken was bordering on undercooked.  I would have sent it back but they were extremely busy.  There were just a few bites that were a little too chewy for my taste even though the juices were clear.  So be aware of that....all in all, Changs gets 4 stars but I agree with others that it is not the best food."}
{"text":"Really had a great dinner. We decided to do a variety of appetizers. Lettuce wraps, crab dumplings, black pepper calamari and the Brussels. Everything was delicious. A little bit of heat on the Brussels was perfect. The manager was fabulous.  She came over to see how dinner was and ended up selling us a dessert."}
{"text":"The service is always great! Great drinks too, but the entrees are always dry. Kind of like they've been reheated in a microwave. Not bad but not great"}
{"text":"P.F Changs will ALWAYS get 5 stars from me, especially the one in Robinson. It is EXTREMELY clean. Huge, and ALWAYS has very pleasant waiters/waitresses/hostesses. Lettuce wraps were AMAZING like always. Although that is probably the most common appetizer and everyone will probably say its the best, im here to disagree! I think the Pan Fried Shrimp Dumplings are the best. There are only a few in each order though, but they are to DIE for. I would like these to be buried with me in my grave :)

The last time i was there we had the Sesame chicken, The Wok Seared Lamb and the VIP Duck. 

The sesame chicken was pretty good, but it was pretty normal. Not up to par with some of the other things i have had from there. I dont care for lamb too much, but PF Changs was actually alright, it was pretty tastey. The duck was a miss though, just too interesting of a taste. Im not sure but i wasnt SUPER happy with it.

But other things ive gotten that i love from there areeee

Chang Shrimp
Chang Chicken
Mongolian Beef!!
Sweet And Sour Chicken
Kung Pao Chicken (best kung Pao Chicken ive ever had. Period)
Kung Pao Shrimp (Like the chicken, best kung pao shrimp ive EVER had)
Beef and Brocolli
Orange Peel Shrimp
Orange Peel Chicken

You cant take stars away because of just a few dishes, so in my opinion its deserving of 5 stars certainely!!

The shooters (deserts) that you can get are very good also.

Be careful when going to either the PF Changs in the Waterfront, or Settlers ridge, if you dont go at an awkward time 2-5 you will be waiting sometimes, more often at the waterfront one because the settlers ridge one is pretty large.

There curbside service IS pretty awesome though also!


Also i have much respect for ANY establishment that has a gluten-free menu because one of my best friends growing up had syliacs disease."}
{"text":"A group of us from the office went here for lunch today. We didn't make reservations but they were very accommodating and was able to seat us pretty quickly. It was free sushi day so each of us ordered a free spicy tuna or California roll. It tasted ok. I ordered the Mongolian beef lunch special. It was really tasty. I do wish they made a spicy version though. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Really liked the atmosphere, energy and great service.

First time I've ever been to P.F. Chang's! And gotta say the experience was great. Our server was exceptional. They started off by giving us a refreshing dragon oolong tea. Not the biggest fan of oolong but it was a unique blend of sweetness and a mild leafy taste. Try it, it surely impressed me. The atmosphere feels classy with the dim lighting, rounded seating and marble-like flooring. The food was satisfying but not without its flaws. Many of the dishes were salty, especially the soup. After a few spoonfuls I couldn't even finish it. The kung pao chicken was so salty it's hard to eat after a few pieces. The honey shrimp was obviously not salty and sweet rather, as it should be :) Thankfully the shrimp made up for the meal but I had to mentally make a note for less salt next time. Other than that, this place is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Visited for my first time ever yestday at 630. Food was excellent and prices were much cheaper than expected. Server was amazing. The whole staff was amazing. Each employee acknowledged us as we entered and left! Defiantly will be back!!!"}
{"text":"We decided on PF Changs based mostly on it's FANTASTIC gluten free menu. Before we my recent discovery, we would only go to this restaurant only at last resort. Our family is not really into the Americanized chain restaurant concept and wait a hour for semi par food. Tonight we had a 7:30 reservation and arrived a couple minutes earlier, as we walked into the door towards the hostess counter we were instantly handed a beeper. Annoying. After twenty minutes after our reservation we were seated. We luckily had a fabulous server who was truly busting his butt. (They were definitely understaffed on a Saturday night) 

I ordered the gluten free lettuce wraps (ahh... I will admit they do have the best lettuce wraps!) and some gluten free citrus chicken. My place I was served with was a tad dirty but they sincerely apologized and retrieved me a new plate. (I'll forgive them this time!) I thought it was extremely thoughtful that they had such an extensive menu and even had gluten free soy sauce! (No San J this trip!) So the lettuce wraps came out smoothly and then our meals came... uh well most of them. They had seemed to have forgotten my meal. (which was not the end of the world, just a tad frustrating) About ten minutes later and when the rest of my family's meals mostly gone, my chicken dish had arrived. It was pretty decent, I must say I enjoy the gluten free chicken dishes better than the fried greasy mess that they sometimes serve you. 

We were later shown the \"shot glass\" deserts and the small gluten free desert but they really did look unappealing. Oh well, Yogurt Builders we go! :)

Overall really just a so-so meal but I really do love that they have a great gluten free menu in such a large chain restaurant. Sometimes when you are at an unknown local something recognized is always great especially when you are certain what you will eat will not make you sick. I probably will go back based on that but I will ALWAYS make a reservation! There was a party sitting next to us when we were waiting that were still there after our meal, I mean is it really worth it?"}
{"text":"This is a good option for something simple.
Is it the best Chinese food option in the area, definitely not.
It is a great place to go with a gang, enjoy some pretty good, fun food.

The staff is always A++!! 
The interior is comfortable, and even a little bit sexy.

I love the appetizers the best. My favorite thing to do here is share everything, and order a bunch of smaller plates of tasty bites! Keep is social and fun! Trust me, you will be happy!"}
{"text":"I gave this location one star because I couldn't give zero stars. From the moment we walked in our experience was less than desirable. We (a party of two) walked to the hostess stand and the girl immediately picked up the phone, essentially ignoring us. She very easily could have greeted us, excused herself to answer the phone and put them on hold to finish helping us.  Another hostess seated us rather quickly as it 8pm on Saturday night and the restaurant was not busy. It took our waitress 10 minutes to speak to us for the first time. She apologized for the wait and took our drink, appetizer and entree order at the same time. She said she would expedite our order because of the wait. She brought our drink order out which was incorrect. Our app came out pretty quickly but we couldn't start eating because we weren't given plates, utensils or a napkin. We had to ask for those after the runner came back a second time. Our entrees finally came out at 8:40. When our waitress came to check on us a few minutes later, we joked to each other that we should've asked for the bill then because we weren't going to see her again. Unfortunately, we were right. It was now nearing 9pm and our waitress was nowhere to be found. We asked another waiter to see if he could find her for us. After about 5-7? minutes we decided to go find the manager and pay that way. Before we went to get up, our waitress came out and we asked for the check. We were going to pay with a credit card but at that point, we wanted to get out of there and figured it would take another 10 minutes to get the bill back so we paid with cash. On our way out, we asked to speak with the manager. The hostess didn't know where they were, went to look for them and then informed us he would be out. After another 5-7? minutes, the manager never came out so we left telling the hostess never mind and we wouldn't be back. She said \"ok.\"we definitely won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Having a last meal with son before we leave at UW. 
The food was very good. 
The server Robin was delightful. Very nice lady. 
It's hard to find good help like her and the manager. 

Will be back"}
{"text":"Since there are not a lot of good Chinese restaurant, I thought I give it a try. Well, the atmosphere is better than typical Chinese restaurant. The food is average fusion. Not too expensive. But not worth it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and have never had an issue in all the years. Its my first place to visit when I come to Arizona visiting. The food and staff are wonderful.The Lettuce Wraps are a must along with the entree Walnut Shrimp Melons."}
{"text":"One of the best customer service experiences I've ever had... and the food ROCKS!
Their servers are knowledgeable, attentive and fun.  I'm not a big fan of 'chain' restaurants because I'm a local-foodie, but this PF Chang's has become a regular stop for our family gatherings.  The Dynamite Shrimp, Crab Rangoon, Veggie Lettuce Wraps are FANTASTIC! The Hunan Hot Fish is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I enjoy PF Chang's and usually come here for lunch for their yummy vegetarian wraps. Yes, that is under their appetizer section, but I always get it for my meal and am always super satisfied after all my lettuce cups are gone. They do offer lunch specials, that will run you eight to ten bucks, that come with rice and a cup of soup, but I have never tried them because I am boring and always get the tofu wraps (seriously yummy). The service has never been great, but those veggie lettuce wraps still keep me coming back. 

I also have to mention that PF Changs is the first place I witnessed the \"mini\" desserts, which now I see almost everywhere. I am a huge fan of their s'mores mini! So much flavor in such a little glass, with a fun little spoon, to eat your little calorie filled (well in comparison to the full size) dessert. Nice job PF Chang's, now to train for your Rock n Roll half marathon I am running to help burn off the calories I consume at your restaurant year round..."}
{"text":"I was already wary going in given the fact that this \"Chinese Restaurant\" was staffed primarily by white college aged kids from the area, but I was willing to give it a shot. I couldn't have been more disappointed.

Walking in, the restaurant has a classy, upscale look to it, although to be honest the place looked more like a hotel lobby than a restaurant. After finally getting the attention of one of the 4 hostesses (who were all too busy talking amongst themselves to notice us), we were told the wait would be 45 minutes, which wasn't too bad given how busy I was told this place can get. I was hoping the long wait was a sign that the food here was really good, but apparently that was flawed logic.

Once we were seated, we got our menus and I wasn't too surprised by the pricing (I had been told this was more towards the expensive end), but what did surprise me were the portion sizes once the food finally came. Even the drinks were tiny. My wife ordered a $9 cocktail and finished it in two gulps. I'm just glad I couldn't make up my mind when the waitress took our drink order or I would have been in the same boat.

When the food came, I was shocked at little of it there was. Aren't Chinese restaurants kind of known for giving out large portions? Not here. The portions were meager, and so was the flavoring. I have never tasted such bland food before in my life. The dish I got was marked as being spicy but it certainly didn't taste that way.

What a huge let down. I can not for the life of me understand why this restaurant is so popular. It's a real shame. If you are looking for a Chinese restaurant in the area, do yourself a favor and visit Ya Fei in Robinson Town Center. The food tastes a million times better, the portions age huge, and you will never wait more than 2 minutes for a seat."}
{"text":"I love going to pf changs.we go for special occasions and on our days off.i always order Chang's spicy chicken and lettuce wraps.my daughter's took me there for mothers day.it was not the best experience this time. We went to the one by green valley ranch.our waiter started out to take our order very perky with a nice smile and very friendly.then it went downhill.i never got my hot tea and when they brought my food nobody at my table had anything to eat with.i also didn't like the fact that they brought my food first before my daughter's soup that was her entree.i also asked for extra sauce for the lettuce wraps because I like to put it in my rice also but that never came.i even asked a worker walking by for a fork to eat with and he never came back.finally I got the manager and he helped us.our waiter apologized to us when he finally came out.he said he was doing something in the office.you know we could have went to a lot  other places but we chose here.also it was later in the evening and was not that busy.things started to die down.my spicy chicken was good as usual but lettuce wraps were not as good as usual.they gave us our hot tea for free and a scoop of ice cream for me.big deal.they could have comped our meal. Next time I will go to the one on paradise."}
{"text":"Me and my husband love to go eat here.we tried the new bowls.i had Chang's spicy chicken.its better just regular.i don't know but it was dry.i like a little sauce that it usually comes with.the chicken comes over dry rice and hardly any sauce.my husband had the  Mongolian beef bowl.again it was dry over rice.i guess they are cutting back on sauce which makes it cutting back on flavor also.next time I think I will try a noodle bowl with chicken or the bowl with beef and an egg on top.it was edible but could have been better.i like to lick my lips when my food tastes so good but not today."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a full day of doctor appointments,  and was greated by a friendly and wonderful staff.  Started with the lobster roll and finished with some orange Peel chicken.  Huge bar and big menu price was not to bad for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Americanized Asian cuisine. Not nearly as good as any Asian place in the Asian district of Cleveland. Crazy expensive for Asian food ($70 for two people)! Old crowd (mostly cougars). Below average food. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say this place has gone SO downhill. We hadn't been in here in at least six months but were craving low key, consistent, Chinese food. We weren't worried about the price. The food was terrible. Overcooked everything! We didn't even take our (lots of) leftovers to go, even though Chinese food is usually great the next day. We didn't complain because that's not our style but won't be back. The bartender who waited on us was super cool, only good part about the dinner."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of having dinner here last night. Chelsea took such great care of us. What this place does well is their consistency: attentive service (just the right amount) and great tasting food. 

Last week we did their curbside pickup for dinner and that was just as effortless. 

Thank you, can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I order take out from this location about once per week. I'm gluten sensitive and enjoy that the chain supports gluten free orders with a special menu, gluten free soy sauce, and even a dessert option.  
That said this location could be so much better!   Although the lunch bartender from whom I usually pick up my order from is excellent, when he's not there my results vary. Also sometimes my food is way way too salty, as others here have mentioned. I also feel you pay a lot for the chain advertising and fancy locations."}
{"text":"We always stop here while in Vegas. Great service and great food as always. The combination fried rice and the pork egg rolls are the best!"}
{"text":"This is not real Chinese food. California Pizza Kitchen goes to China."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this pfchangs location, the portions are much smaller than the one at Phillips place in Charlotte.  The portions are VERY SMALL IF you request your order to be done by takeout or to go.   Good luck"}
{"text":"We took the family because we had a gift card to cover a bit of the cost. As a Phoenix Native, I can remember eating at the first PF's when they opened at Scottsdale Fashion Square and what a great experience that was. They are a long way from that. For the money we had to pay for a family of five - 2 appetizers, 5 entrees , 2 alcoholic drinks, 3 kid's drinks and 5 of their $3 mini desserts  - $150 before tip. The food and ambience is not worth it. Pop music playing in the background, bus trays of dirty dishes sitting unattended for over 20 minutes. Now it is a just place for dinner, it is a chain, and it feels that way. Next time, we'll stick to Pei Wei for a 1/3 the cost."}
{"text":"This place is always busy! I love everything here! Dan Dan noodles hasn't been on the menu for a long time but they're still able to make this dish for me. Cravings satisfied !!!"}
{"text":"So I was sitting here an d this caucasion man maybe the manager ask the caucasion man and his women/friend if they wanted anything, but hasn't once ask me if I needed anything! Then another couple maybe Armenian and Asian girl he goes over to them and still he or my waitress does ask if I want anything or am okay. This must be a Republican place. They should just have a sign outside saying no blacks. Because first they sit me right besides a register so they can look at my every move.all of us blacks aren't bad. I need to be working for Under Cover Boss. Thanks Sylvia for not coming back to ask me if I needed anything,..oh but the food was great I ordered Korean Barbeque with Beef. And fried rice."}
{"text":"I met up with a few of my friends for happy hour.  I have to say that I\"m a little disappointed that they removed the street tacos from the happy hour menu.  I know it seems odd to expect tacos at a Chinese restaurant, but it's not like it's an authentic chinese restaurant.  

So we had the lettuce wraps, which are always good.  Tried the dynamite shrimp and really enjoyed that.  I also had spare ribs, which were really good.  
Now, the mojito I didn't like.  I was told it was going to be on the sweeter side...it wasn't, at all.
Our server was attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"Love this pf changs !!! Bar staff is so fantastic we always sit there and enjoy great company ...great food and awesome drinks and desserts! !
Ashley and lexy are the best !!!"}
{"text":"I've always been against going here but came here for business lunch purposes. I generally don't believe in Americanized Chinese food, especially when it's a chain. I was pleasantly surprised though! The food was well made, offered some semi authentic flavors and was priced well during lunch time. Service is super friendly too. I enjoyed my Chilean sea bass which is always a safe yummy choice but hard to find, though it was a bit too sweet for my taste. I would actually be ok to come back!"}
{"text":"This is more of a three star review but I gave it an extra star because of how much of a sweet heart the waiter was. We had just gotten into Vegas and this location is not ideal because of all the people outside of P Hollywood trying to get u to join things and what not. We asked him how the hell can we get out of here and not pass the people out front? And he gave us directions to go out the side door Hahaha. 

Anyways, the food was so so. It's a PF changs. Not terrible but not great. Dan Dan noodles kind of watery. If you're hungry and have a coupon like we did it's worth stopping"}
{"text":"This particular location was not on par with other Chang's restaurants that I have eaten at. We ate here on a Thursday night about 9:30, busy but not unusually crowded. The service was extremely slow an disorganized (ex. Late arrival of setups, no appetizer dishes with appetizer, and entrees 45 minutes after seating).  My friend's Spicy Chicken was lukewarm and the rice cold, and my Citrus Soy Salmon was tough; all signs of food that had sat under heat lamps for too long. I suspect the restaurant's XO is not exactly on the ball about keeping large volumes of food moving quickly. 
On the positive side, our complaints were dealt with courteously, and new entrees delivered in 7 minutes. If it weren't for this handling I would have given this experience one star."}
{"text":"I love PF Changs, but this location doesn't have the same quality of food as other PF Changs, like South Park and others. I've been to this location twice and the food is like it was made the day before. Server was very good, it's just the food here is not up to par as other PF Changs that I've been to"}
{"text":"I've had PF Changs both in Pgh and KC and honestly, I'm never been disappointed nor elated with the food. It's 'upscale' Ameri-Chinese food. You don't come here seeking 'authentic' Asian staples; it's all changed to some degree to suit American taste buds... nothing wrong with that, imo. Do I even know what 'authentic' Chinese food is? Yes, sortuv, somewhat. Will I stop putting quotes around 'everything'? Definitely not!

It was 45 min from closing time when we (party of 6) rushed in on a weeknight; got seated, ordered and ate without feeling rushed by the staff.

This particular PF Changs, on the Homestead Waterfront, had fast and friendly service, though he forgot our order of asparagus. We sampled everything from the the Szechuan shrimp to the Mongolian beef to the Dan Dan Noodles. Good flavors, nothing that stepped out in the crowd.

I don't come here all that often but when I do, I invariably leave feeling satisfied and full."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place is so successful. We ordered on-line for curb side pick up. I got there 10 minutes before I was supposed to and got out of my car. Before I could shut my door, a young man was heading towards me with a bag of food. I was impressed with the speed, but thought that had I been on time, my food would not have been nearly as hot.

When I got home and we took the food out, I was shocked to see such small portions, due to the money I just shelled out!!!

The lo mein was adequate, the (orange, or something like it) chicken was vwry tasty, and the lettuce wraps are very good. 

All in all the food was decent,  but the value is no where to be seen. 

Don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"We had the worst experience at this location. Food took forever!! Two people didn't even get our food until everyone was done eating. I finally asked and a the server was so rude and annoyed at me like it was my fault. I decided to talk to the manager and he just stared at me with a blank stare. I had to ask if he even cared what I was saying. He had such an attitude of indifference. He came over and said he gave us a discount. $4.00!!!! He then gave the people who got their food a free appetizer ??? What the heck??? I'm giving them 1 star because at least the shrimp was good.  Horrible!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here   . The decor here was great the place was super clean  . I was greeted immediately felt welcome . Food came out fast and hot  the waiter Shane  was the best ever !!!! A ++++"}
{"text":"This used to be one of favorite places so after a while of not having lunch there I decided to go for my birthday. I was more than disappointed. The concept that u so much loved had changed completely. They no longer brought out and made the sauce at your table. When I asked I was told that corporate changed it to by request only. Despite requesting it I never got it. No sugar for my ice t and the food was not the same. Needless to say I will not be returning to this chain anymore. Corporate strikes again. So long PF Changs.  It was a good run while it lasted."}
{"text":"So this place is never a disappointment. From the moment you walk in, get your seat,  meet your server, everything is excellent. Tonight we sat at the bar, a member of management stopped by our area, the staff was so nice! This place has to have amazing leadership. Everyone was great. Now to the food, it was unbelievably delicious. Perfect serving sizes, warm colorful. Just delicious. Again we didn't finish it all and the staff had no problem wrapping everything up for us. Now the price is a little high, but with this level of service I'll pay that every time! This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Although I have been enjoying the fare of PF Chang's since it opened, I decided today, after a visit that it was time to offer a review. In addition to this location I have also been to the Lynnwood WA and Minneapolis MN locations...all three offer exceptional cuisine, delightful ambiance and excellent service. 

Usually I enjoy the Broccoli and Chicken but today I decided to have my hubs favorite; the Mongolian Beef. We also ordered a side of sweet peas and started the meal with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps. Oh my gosh, I totally forgot how much I ADORE this place! 

From the food to the Mango Iced Tea, the extensive wine list and delightfully unique alcoholic concoctions...this is a great place to go either for lunch or dinner. And with waiters who actually seem to LIKE their job, you are in for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Gave P.F. Chang's the beef and broccoli test.  They passed.  Beef was tender and the brocoli was crisp.  The dish wasn't overly salty and had a rich flavor.  Grabbed the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer.  It was a solid order as well, though a bit salty as the name implies.  Sauces were delicious.  I wouldn't rate the food as better than a local place but it was quite excellent.

Chang's is a bit spendy compared to those local places but the service is excellent and I'm fine with paying for the experience.   Our waitress was prompt and friendly and delivered a relaxing experience overall.  The interior is a bit dark but comfortable and relaxing.  Chang's does draw crowds though so it can get a bit noisy.   

Highly recommended if you're looking for a more professional experience and want to be taken care of.  Good for dates or adult friend and family outings.  The full service bar is excellent."}
{"text":"It's a chain, and its offerings are rarely changed. That said, the service was stellar, and my friend's low-salt needs were very nicely accommodated. Something for everyone; just a tad more expensive than non-chain Chinese restaurants (and yeah, they have sushi)."}
{"text":"First impressions are everything.

I ate here yesterday evening (around 7PM on a Tuesday)...

My friend and I attempted to enter through the revolving door; however, there were two children blocking the entry...one on either side of the frame, both pushing. We stood there for a moment, staring at them, assuming that their father would take charge and make them stop...he didn't.

We entered through the side door. 

The hostess was polite, but was either deaf or incapable of answering my questions. She stood behind her register along with another female and an older, bald male, who may have been her boss...he just stared at me and watched as the woman seemingly ignored me.

We were then taken to our booth. I ordered warm saké and an ice water; my friend had a water.

Eventually, empty plates were brought out. Despite the dim lighting, I could see many, many water spots all over the plates and silverware...

Parents allowed their children to run around and act like animals. Since I faced the lobby area from my table, I could clearly see the clientele that this place attracted. People who dine here seem incapable of acting like civilized members of society...laying on the benches inside the restaurant, acting obnoxious at their dinner tables, talking on their phones...did I mention that there were kids running around the lobby as their inattentive parents ignored them?

I digress...

My friend's Mongolian beef tasted pretty good. It sure as h*ll was not worth $18. The portion wasn't exactly worth it and the beef (which he allowed me to sample) was dry and chewy.

My ginger chicken was nice. Plump and juicy, very flavorful...the rice, though, was barely warm. 

Overall, I would not go back here unless I were given a gift card. The food portions are overpriced and the atmosphere is...lol...I don't know an accurate word to describe it. 

A word to parents: control your kids. It's not my fault that you decided to procreate, but it reflects directly upon you when your kids act uncivilized. You're the main reason why I am negatively reviewing this restaurant.

A word to management: lower the prices a couple of dollars, clean your cutlery and dishes and ban parents who allow their kids to use your restaurant as a playground.

I probably will not return here...unless a friend offers to pay for my meal and a good amount of alcohol is in store."}
{"text":"Was staying at Planet Hollywood for the weekend and needed a quick, good dinner on a Saturday night. Decided to get take out from here because the wait for a table was ridiculous. The place was jacked. Placed an order at their take out window and sat down at the last seat on the end of the bar, which was three deep. As crowded as it was, the bartender noticed little ol' me and asked me if I needed anything. When I said I was just waiting for a to-go order, instead of asking me to give my seat up, he gave me a free coke. 

Got my food (spring rolls, sesame chicken and dan dan noodles) and took it back to my room. It was fresh, perfectly seasoned and just what the hangover doctor ordered. I thought all chain restaurants were basically the same, but this location had, but far, the best food I've ever had from a PF Chang's, and i've been to about five of them all over California.

If you want really shitty PF Chang's, buried in salt with stale or undercooked rice, served by unapologetic waiters who bring you more of the same when you try to send you dish back, I recommend the one in downtown San Jose. Epically bad. How these two restaurants belong to the same company is one of life's mysteries."}
{"text":"Well, let's what can I about this place. 


If you ever ate P.F Chang's it's just under average for my experience here. 

The service was kinda slow my family and I, came in for a late dinner so it was empty wasn't busy at all. 

They never cleaned off the table or checked to see if we need plates to be removed as what other restaurants would do. 

The food: it was OK nothing really to be amazed by after all it's P.F Chang's , I ordered Spicy Tune Rolls it was really plain not much too it expected more to be honest as they offered it as a main plate not an appetizer. 

Also ordered sesame chicken , it was very sweet and kind a spongey to be honest wasn't very pleasant. 

Also as a appetizer we offered the chicken lettuce wraps they we're just OK. 

Once in a great while I'll come in but I don't think I'll visit this one for a while not for the price and quality of the food.

This place is basically good for stop in have a drink or two and maybe an appetizer nothing more. 

I hope this helps people to whom ever would like to try this place don't expect much ."}
{"text":"The bar is always a great option here, the staff is very good and the food is great.

The orange edamame is great, spicier than the original"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 0 star! GARBAGE!!! This place doesn't serve authentic Chinese food.
I was so disappointed when I dined out at this place. The portion is small, the price is unreasonable and the taste is blah...I don't mind small portion and high price as long as the taste is excellent. Not this place!
Not going back for sure."}
{"text":"The best happy hour menu & happy hour drinks. The coconut lemon sour tastes great & the crispy green beans are to die for. Very reasonably priced happy hour food menu ! The spare ribs are very good too. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place. They do have good food ben here several times, also service is great to. You just have to understand somehow most of the times family owned is almost always better."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this PF Chang's and I was not impressed. The service was extremely slow even though it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy. The portions were small. 

They were also playing 5 year old pop music really loud. Pop music?! Come on--this is an \"Asian Bistro.\""}
{"text":"Delicious chicken lettuce wraps, excellent service and ambiance.  My husband's shrimp dish was too salty.  Otherwise, great drinks and food.  I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Now, I absolutely love their food (probably one of my favorite places to eat) but the customer service at this place ABSOLUTELY SUCKS! I don't know if they get a kick out of keeping customers waiting or if that are just that lazy but EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I come here, I am either sitting at the bar waiting foreverrrrrr for someone to come greet me or I have to flag someone down. I usually eat alone here and I even complained to manager, Jacob, once and he sent me some gift cards. Came back, same experience. I'm an ex-server so I get it but so ridiculous. Sad that I EXPECT bad service. Poor, poor job this PF Chang location."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Chinese food, but you are seriously paying for the decor and cougars that grace this place (lord knows I love cougars)! The food is sub-par at best and could easily be replicated at Panda Express for less. I still contend that some of the best Chinese food is located in the hoods of Las Vegas...just dont go there too late at night! LOL!"}
{"text":"I have always loved P.F. Chang's. Since moving here to las vegas, this was my second time eating at this location.  I normally eat at the location on the strip. My boyfriend has celiac disease and its the only place we always know we will be okay to eat and have a great date night. Tonight we sat at the bar and had a great time with our bartender Shelby, and the manager Patrick. It was lovely, and amusing, we really felt at home and appreciate the beyond great service. If I ever have to recommend a place it will be this one. The staff are amazing and the atmosphere is very inviting and welcoming. Thank you so much Shelby and Patrick!! Patrick and I had a great date night and a memorable one with the great service we received. So Happy!!!! Thank you!!!! We will be back again for our future date nights!!

So I guess I had such a great time last time I forgot to post my review.
My boyfriend and I returned again today, and we had a blast. Patrick was here again and remembered us. Such great customer service. It really made us feel welcomed. Maria was our bartender today. We got great service and felt at home. This will be our number one spot for when we go out. Thank you Patrick and Maria! You guys really made our day amazing. Highly recommended this location and very grateful and appreciative of the staff and service we have received every single time we come in. Patrick always makes sure we leave with a smile on our faces! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Love the staff here!!!"}
{"text":"hello there I made a mistake we went to this location not the goodyear one we had a wonderful time if you do go  get that chocolate cake yum yum the server  maddison was such a wonderful  person and we had such a wonder ful time  the have happy hour  from 3pm until 6pm  so check that out as well  but save room for that cake"}
{"text":"Had lunch at PF Chang yesterday with friends and this time we had salads. 
This is the first time I've ever had a salad at PF Chang but it certainly won't be the last. The best salad I've ever had was the Mandarin Crunch  salad with a side of shrimp. About as fresh as a salad can get with cabbage, carrots, mango,almonds and a few  other ingredients topped with delicious Mandarin vinaigrette dressing. Excellent. 
One friend had a Caesar salad with a side of grilled salmon... That's going to be my next one. Looked  delicious and she loved it.  Pad Thai and Mongolian Beef  were the two other girls choices, But glad I ordered the Mandarin Crunch salad... It was awesome! 
Service of course is always good here
And the ambience is too... At least it was after we asked them to turn down the loud music."}
{"text":"I've dined at numerous p f changs and this was the best experience I've had.  I can not say enough about how AMAZING our server was!  Her name was Robin and she was super attentive, knowledgeable, and overall she is the reason our experience was superb..  She made great recommendations and really knew the menu.  She smiled and was super friendly, I will be dining at this restaurant every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We came here on a weeknight. It wasn't crazy busy and we were seated promptly by a very friendly hostess. I believe her name was Lex? Lexi? We requested a booth away from the busier section of the restaurant and she accommodated us perfectly. She handed us menus and told us our server would be with us shortly. 

We were given water and asked if were interested in any drinks. I ordered wine as usual and my friend ordered a cocktail. We were both pleasantly happy with the drink selection. 

We ordered the eggplant and the tofu lettuce wraps. Both were really good... Not overly salty like pervious visits to the location. Portions were large enough for us to just share the two items. We ordered another drink and were both pretty full. 

The pricing was fair and parking was plenty. We will definitely be returning in the future next time we are in the mood for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Britney was amazing. My son and I had been traveling all day and were in a hurry so I called in the order to be ready when we arrived to eat so we could get right back on the road. When we arrived our drinks were on the table. We weren't sitting for more than a minute and our food came out. It was delicious as always. Her customer service was A+. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love PF Changs. You can't go wrong with their happy hour prices and I've never had a dish that didn't taste good and these are meat free and fish free dishes I'm referring too.  On this particular visit, our server, Twyla could have won an award for best server of all eternity. She just nailed every single thing and more in terms of what a server should do. I have to admit that although the flavors of the foods we order are always on point, some can be very oily or sometimes a little too salty for my tastebuds. I highly recommend their Vietnamese Noodle salad..so light and refreshing. Ask for the dressing on the side as it is kind of spicy or ask for an alternative dressing. I love that there is always leftovers to take home. Don't forget to sign up for their rewards program!"}
{"text":"The food is usually great at PF Changs in different States and thought would be the same at this location and went for Father's Day but we were very disappointed. The calamari tasted like it was freezer burnt and was very bland. The beef and broccoli was very salty and just tasted like it was drowned in soy sauce. Everything else was ok. Not good. The portion size was tiny for what they charge. It is very over priced for mediocre food. Needless to say it was a waste of $90. We would've had way better Chinese food at our local Chinese place for a lot less money and a lot more food."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and always reliable. Kris is the most amazing server ever and super friendly. Honey Chicken is so fresh and light and makes you feel less guilty."}
{"text":"Just moved to are and have celiac disease and they have a great gluten free menu. Atmosphere is great and service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a very long time mainly because parking is a turn off, but I'm happy I met my gf here for lunch. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and they were delicious as always. Service was great, but I'm always disappointed when waiters try to pick up a plate as I'm still savoring my last few bites!!! I find this to be very rude and it reflects poor customer service training. I understand that table need to be turned over, but rushing customers off is a big no-no in my book."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience I had, so great that I am writing a review for a chain restaurant that already has what- 1,000 reviews???

I took my mother to lunch yesterday, and this was the destination. After several strokes, she struggles to walk and uses a walker. The great service started w/ a phone call to ask about the best parking for easy access, because after circling around, it was truly a mystery to me. The lady who answered advised me of exactly where to park and suggested entering at the take-out door because it was a much shorter walk. Once we got in we were allowed to select any seat we wished.

Our waiter was so genuinely sweet, attentive and helpful. Neither one of us had been there for some time and we asked for suggestions from the lunch menu. He made several very descriptive recommendations that made our ordering very simple. He kept the delicious and fresh iced tea coming.  

Every food item was perfectly prepared & served as it should be- hot items hot, cold items cold. The egg drop soup was so flavorful I don't' think I will ever be able to enjoy it anywhere else again. The salad was perfect- lightly dressed, perfect balance of greens and other ingredients. 

Our entrees were Walnut Shrimp with Melon and Mongolian Beef, which we shared. The honeydew balls were a perfect foil for the crispy shrimp and honey glazed walnuts. The Mongolian Beef was amazing- so often is is chewy at other places but PF Chang's preparation using quality beef results in a tender steak quality product.

I am perplexed as to how PF Chang's fell off of my radar.  Yes! We will return, and it will be soon."}
{"text":"Not my best or favorite experience at a PF Chang's but I haven't always had bad experiences at this location. 

I went in recently and almost everything was off. The chicken in the sweet and sour soup was so bad I could tell by the smell reaking from my step moms soup.

My food was somewhat cold when it came out but it was somewhat of an off day from what others seconded & ht what my family who comes regularly says"}
{"text":"I love this place. I know that I can always get good food. They are on top of it. I ate here more than five time and each time food great. We got a server once that....I could have passed though."}
{"text":"Our family loves this restaurant.  My children and I suffer from food allergies.   I have Celiac's Disease and their gluten free selection for a Chinese restaurant is great.  My children are a completely different ball game.  They have a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus where food attacks their body.  They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  Our favorite manager is Joe and favorite server is Kevin.  Call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions."}
{"text":"absolute waste of time and money. Good looking waitress but whats the use f the food takes ages to come. Taste is average and not worth the cost. Ie no value for money. Not gonna visit this one again.
I can cook my own noodles at home for 1/10th the price and 200% better taste."}
{"text":"I have been to 3 P.F. Chang's in my lifetime and this is my least favorite.  Just took my girlfriend there this weekend for her birthday celebration, and P.F. Chang's was the worst part of the evening.  Now don't get me wrong we had an amazing evening so in retrospect P.F. Chang's was A-OK.

I suggest making reservations especially on the weekends this is the busiest one I have been to.  The hostess wasn't that great took an hour for us to be seated even though I made reservations.  Was not happy, the great thing was the food here.  If you don't care about eating bad food for you get the lettuce wraps they are delicious.  I had the ginger chicken and broccoli which was great also.  Very large portion sizes for dinner be aware.

The atmosphere was beautiful, but if you are looking for something intimate or romantic stay away just way to loud and open for that feeling.  I suggest going to the P.F. Chang's in Phillips Place personally.  Not as many kids, more of a adult feel.

I would suggest P.F. Chang's anytime, just maybe not this one based on the situation."}
{"text":"Terrible service. What a waste to spend $ and time to come here for lunch. I called my order in an hour prior to pick up. Had to wait 15 min for it and then it was made wrong. Thankfully I work next door so I was able to bring it back over to be fixed. However upon my return no one apologized for the error or inconvenience of having to come back. Cleary their team needs a lesson in what customer service is. I would give them zero stars if that was an option."}
{"text":"Great foods as usual but the wait was awful around 45 min maybe more for our order to come out. Other than that everything was excellent service and all"}
{"text":"I used to love this place! This place has gone steeply downhill since my last visit! I've had far better food at pei wei and even little hole in the wall mom and pop Chinese food places in mini strip malls than what we got tonight for over $40! 

We ordered pick up...Kung pao chicken and honey walnut shrimp. It was horrible! The chicken tasted like it was rolled in BBQ sauce, had hardly any onions, no peanuts, and barely enough sauce to coat the chicken, much less enough to mix with the rice! No flavor...It tasted dry and old. The honey walnut shrimp was absolutely disgusting. It was shrimp coated in what tasted like mayonnaise and tossed with some balls of honeydew melon and maybe 4 walnuts. No flavor at all. It tasted like something you would serve cold at a picnic.

I would take panda express any day over the crap they served us tonight!

What a shame!  We hadn't been there in a couple of years, and we definitely will not be back again!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.
Food has an aftertaste of an old cooking oil.
Will not come here again"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went to the Planet Hollywood location at 11pm on a Saturday night after a show. We got a prime spot on the patio right on the strip... walked right in. Had the best server ever! Friendly, efficient, and took initiative to make sure our experience was great. The food was delicious... won ton soup, crispy green beans, Singapore noodles, and chicken and broccoli were all fresh and delicious. For dessert, we had the mandarin sponge cake I'm coconut milk - so good!
Fairly priced... delicious food... great service. This is how it is supposed to be!"}
{"text":"I don't recommend this restaurant if you have food allergies. They are not allergy friendly. My mom is allergic to black pepper, onions, yeast, broccoli. We were told they preseason all of their meat before it gets to the restaurant. Which is stupid there are people who are allergic to spices. So all my mom had to eat was edamame."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! The entire staff is over the top friendly, professional, curtious, funny, very helpful, and delightful. They bend over backwards to see that their guests are happy. They honored an expired small dessert coupon. The mouth watering food is made from scratch. All of it, everything!! I have never been disappointed. The prices rock too! And...  It's very easy to earn buy one get one entree. Sign up for rewards and Watch \"Farm To Wok\" on their website. There ya go!  Eat there! There ya go! Who doesn't love free mouth watering food. You just can't get any better than PF Chang's on Camelback."}
{"text":"PF Chang's rocks. Great service, food, atmosphere, prices. I am never disappointed regardless of which PF Changs I go to. Parking in this location is a bit of a challenge. I think my food transportation specialist knows that I truly appreciate them. I always ask their name and use it every time they come to the table. The food transportation specialist are very very attentive. I appreciate you check them!"}
{"text":"Our service was excellent and our food was delicious! Dustin anticipated all of our needs and made our experience perfect. We were a party of six that were celebrating my four year-old's birthday. We've been to this location on a variety of times and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent, but I am giving this PF Changs 1 star solely because I nearly got mugged 2x's in the parking lot tonight. Visitors BE AWARE of the crime in the parking lot after the sun goes down!

I dropped my dad (who is 87 years old) off at the front door upon arrival. Their parking lot is large with no lights. A perfect place for thugs.  

I was approached by a woman the first time, asking for money. She scared the sh-- out of me because she came from nowhere, and thankfully I had the instincts to go the other way and move fast. When I got inside I told the hostess there was a woman loitering. 

When my dad and I left, I had him wait for me, and I looked in the parking lot to be on the safe side and there was no one around.

I was about a foot away from my car and a man appeared from no where and was a about 6 feet in front of me. I quickly got in my car and locked the doors and he was yelling and screaming absurd things to me. 

I picked up my dad, rushed him into my car, warned the folks getting out of their car and snapped a photo of him. 

 I called the restaurant and spoke to the MGR and told him about both incidents. Sadly the food and service is great here, but I would never risk my safety for PF Changs! They need security, valet, and a well lit parking lot unless you are ok with being approached by thugs and ready to defend yourself. 

I will never return to this PF Changs again during the day or night unless I am carrying a gun."}
{"text":"A rep at PF Chang's got back to me and resolved the issue. It's rare to find a company that actually responds to reviewer's feedback, so I added 2 stars."}
{"text":"My golfing buddies and I elected to give PF Chang's a try.  Good decision.  Started with the lettuce wraps.  Always good.  But, these were not quite as good as usual.  The lettuce as more yellow than green, and a little on the bitter side.  I had the Shrimp w/ Lobster Sauce.  It was very good--an excellent blend of flavors.  The other guys were very pleased with their meals and all agreed they would try Chang's again.  I had encouraged the guys to try the Salt & Pepper Prawns, but none did.  It's one of my absolute favorite PF Chang's dishes.  

Summary:  Very good food.  Moderately priced.  Excellent service.  Nice decor.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Chain restaurant. Nothing special here. 
Got a ginger something cocktail, it was bad!
Small portions for a main meal. Cold and dark inside :/"}
{"text":"Only tried this place once so far and wasn't very impressed. Chicken was decent just kinda odd flavoring on most dishes. Quickly made and decent prices and service so might try them again."}
{"text":"MAJOR SHOUT OUT TO PAOLO!!!! He is amazing and went above and beyond to give me what I want!!! My friends and I enjoyed ourselves. #StaffIsVeryAttractive lol and very professional."}
{"text":"Have not been to PFC for about 10 years. My son gave me a gift certificate for Christmas and yesterday l decided it was a nice day and l drove over to the East side to use it.  Arrived ~ 12:45 and was seated after a slight hiccup (2 men arrived after me and the waiter seated them before (perhaps) an older woman with white hair.  Another employee saw this and seated me.  The waiter who sat the men turned out to be my waiter.  He also turned out to be quite a nice fellow.  And an excellent waiter.  Therefore PFC stilled received my 5*.  The mixup at the beginning was properly handled. 
I ordered Hot/Sour soup, crab rangoon appetizer, and the Crispy Lobster and Shrimp Rice meal.  
The soup was entirely different then any l have had before, however very good. Crab app was excellent and the lobster/shrimp rice was absolutely delicious.  Although l am a west sider l would certainly get my passport stamped and return to the east side to eat at this fine restaurant again."}
{"text":"Came here last night after a concert at the Cosmo! Everything was amazing! The food was great! But most important, the service was INCREDIBLE. My sister was stoked to have the Pineapple ice cream for dessert. But they didn't have it at the time. Our server, Robyn took care of it. And so did the manager Evan. All in all, the food was great, but I'm more so so impressed by the customer service. Thanks for making mine and my sister's night that much better. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Was Leary about this stop in because of the reviews but I was out voted and we were starving. The service was great! The hostess was sweet! And the food was decent- the salmon I added to my salad was over charred the shrimp dumplings i ordered as an app were room temp. Other than that it was just decent. I gave it 4 stars for the service mostly"}
{"text":"Was just in for lunch and everything was great. Our waiter, Manny, was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and was exceptionally helpful. The food tasted great, and my wife tried something new, but did not finish it due to the item not being what the thought. Even she admitted nothing was wrong with it, it just wasn't for her. Manny apologized for it and the manager came out and apologized as well. They even took it off the bill! This location will go the extra mile to please guests!"}
{"text":"Reservations for a birthday at table of 6 from the beginning the service was horrible we were greeted only for 20 minutes. Had empty drinks all night the waiter was not attentive with anything. The management staff promise to take care of us and they did not the whole experience was a nightmare I will never go back."}
{"text":"So I have to admit that I haven't been to a PF CHANGS in several years. When I traveled for business I always looked for PF's  and eventually ate at twenty different locations and everything was consistent at each location. I miss some of the old things...Sauce prepared table side and most of all...DUCK! Normally when we went we always ordered five or six appetizers and finished everything. There wasn't a location where we used to live and moving back to the Charlotte area we finally decided to go. As an original WARRIOR CARD HOLDER, and not dining at any PF's in years, I was constantly getting emails with special offers. We decided to take them up on their \"buy one entree get one\". What a disappointment this meal was. I had KUNG PAO SHRIMP. A small plate came to the table with almost enough shrimp to make a meal out of and very few peanuts. It looked like the kitchen thought of putting some sauce on the plate but after a few drippings, thought better of it. The celery also seemed to be non-existent. My wife had CHANG'S LOBSTER AND SHRIMP RICE.  Once again another plate of just okay food.  The fried lobster was over cooked and chewy. The rice was also over cooked and had no taste. We had to ask for the dipping sauce from the Calamari to add some flavor.  I usually send bad food back but we had our Granddaughter with us and didn't have the time. We just suffered through the meal.   Sorry PF CHANGS but it looks like a few more years of emails before we go back. On the positive side, our waiter was excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. This restaurant is located on the strip of vegas so the view is nice, especially at night. They have indoor and outdoor seating.  Their staff and extremely friendly. Timing of food was decent for a Sunday night. Ambiance is nice, dark setting nice tables and seats. Went with the dinner meal for two people which came out to about $49.00 total after tax. Dinner meal included 2 appetizers, 1 starter,  2 entrees and 1 dessert. We also got an appetizer on the house! Gotta love free food! My husband and I went with the egg drop soup, egg rolls, orange peel chicken and pepper steak. The crab wontons were delicious,  which were on the house. 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"Went here with a big group for a work-related lunch. I ordered the shrimp with candied walnuts. I've had this before at other P.F. Chang locations and this time it tasted particularly odd. Usually there's a mild sweetness to this dish, but this time it was only salty. To make sure, I had some coworkers try it and they agreed it didn't taste right. Our server also took some back to the cook. The manager offered to give me additional sauce, but I don't think that would have helped. I settled for stir-fried eggplant and even that was super salty. By the time my eggplant dish arrived, most of my co-workers were done with their meal.

I do like P.F. Chang's, but I'm not sure if I'll be going back to the one in Mesa. It was rather embarrassing since I was the one who recommended P.F. Changs for the team lunch to begin with."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with PF Changs. We had their chicken lettuce wraps, which of course did not disappoint. I had the Sea Bass and it was fantastic. I'm not a fan of spinach (which it comes with) so they let me substitute it out with broccoli and carrots, which I highly recommend. 

I also had their Moscow Mule. It's made with their own homemade Ginger beer. It was kinda weak. I was expecting to taste more ginger but I tasted a lot of water....like they watered it down? Weird. 

Their only downfall, it was a Friday evening and the place was packed. They had their windows open and it was quite warm out and the place was smoldering. We asked the waitress to have the manager turn on the AC, which he did, but the windows were open, so it didn't make much of a difference. 

Food was good and the service was impeccable. I would go back, I'd just bring  my own fan and a flask."}
{"text":"Pfchangs has some of the best Chinese food around. Big portions. Great happy hour menu. Clean, sleek decor and great service. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Brand spankin' new chain food! This place is a tad different than the other ones around you wont find the giant horses out front here and its a very open layout inside with giant light fixtures that look like drums hanging from above. Its a good thing we don't have to worry about earthquakes here folks! The hostess was totally pleasant I wish I were young and enjoyed my job as much. Our waiter was excellent he knew his shit. My sister and I started off with their white pear Mojitos they could have been stronger but they weren't overly sweet and quite refreshing. We didn't have to replace the drink with water during the meal so we just kept the Mojitos flowing. We started w the seared ahi tuna I didn't care for the peanutty wasabi sauce that came on it next time I'd get it on the side it definitely had a kick to it. I had the Buddha's Feast, fried it was nothing special I probably wont order that again I could easily make that at home, the Shanghai Cucumbers were good like always. My sister had the orange peel chicken and was told by the waiter to eat the peels w the chicken she loved it and we both had leftovers to bring home at the end.

They had $2 desert cups we had the strawberry shortcake and banana split both were very rich and tasty. We left very full and happy for our Sunday treat."}
{"text":"While shopping in the waterfront in Homestead, we decided to make a second trip to P.F Changs. Our first visit was an evening for dinner with reservations. I truly enjoyed the evening. The Asian Grilled Salmon with dry rub was not overly spicy, just as I like it. I just acquired a taste for asparagus and enjoyed it as well. Remembering our dinner, we stopped for lunch this trip. We had a gift card for our lunch that day. The restaurant wasn't crowed so no reservation was needed. It was a Monday afternoon. I like the decor and the atmosphere of the dining room. I ordered the weekday lunch paring. California Roll, and Vegetable Spring Roll and added the Egg Roll , it was really good!, would definitely order again. The service was great, friendly and very accommodating to us. The gift card helped to absorb some of the cost. The cost is appropriate for what you receive, but some will say it is still too expensive. As many have posted it is not your typical Chinese restaurant, more like a California yuppie vibe, but I like it. It's clean, neatly laid out and it offers a great decor and atmosphere. If you're willing to spend the money it is worth it. I would say, I would be back if I had another gift card or certificate."}
{"text":"\"Tastefully Expensive\" is how I would describe this restaurant. Their food: amazing. Love it every time. But very pricey in my opinion. The whole atmosphere is nice, best for business lunches/dinners and maybe some classy dates. 

Although, the hostesses need to learn some manners. The waiters/waitresses are usually very friendly and talkative, but the ladies at the front need to be less cold towards the customers. Once for lunch, my friends and I went in dressed with flip flops and shorts. The woman at the front shriveled her nose and looked at us up and down, placing us in the very back of the empty restaurant (we moved ourselves to a nicer seat after she left) and the waiter was apologetic. Other times I've overheard the hostesses whispering to each other, complaining about the children in the place, or even making fun of some of the customers. I get that its supposed to be a \"high-end bistro\" but those ladies could learn a thing or two from the much friendlier waiters/waitresses. If you're going to complain about your job, do it on Facebook, not within earshot of your customers."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Love the atmosphere and food is delish! Got the new firecracker chicken, steamed. Came with a side of brown rice. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing.... It.keeps.me.coming back! you have to try the pot stickers they are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Good Service but in a World of Noodles and Good Chinese Food this place fails.  No competition to Beijing Noodle9 at Caesars. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with portions of our meal last night. My wife ordered the lettuce wraps as her main and the quality of the lettuce was less than impressive. 

We asked to speak to manager, and after acknowledging upfront the he could tell we were unhappy, he proceeded to give us an explanation about how it was a combination of the kitchen staff and the new spec they had to work with. 

No offer to correct the problem or offer a partial credit. I've had issues resolved better at Buffalo Wild Wing for crying out loud!  Bottom line is our server was very good but the manager and his handling of our issue is enough to turn us off this chain for a very long time."}
{"text":"This place sucks! it is always crowed and very expensive, they have you by the balls, because it is located near green valley casino."}
{"text":"I recently went to P.F. Chang's with my best friend, and we had not only great food but amazing service. Our waiter Rick, was amazing, very helpful and prompt. Lately, I have encounter so many waiters and waitresses that hate their job, that it was refreshing to see somebody enjoying it. It makes you want to come back. So if you go to P.F Chang's lettuce wraps are a must, the salt and pepper calamari is delicious, and leave some room for their mind blowing banana spring rolls and don't forget to request for Rick, so far the best waiter I had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!! Had a reservation for 13 at 7:30 didn't get seated until 8:00, took an hour to order drinks and appetizers. The drinks that were ordered had to be sent back because they were horrible, maybe because they were using the wrong measure. It then took another hour to get our food, which it did not all come out at the same time. We were told that the drinks were going to be taken off our bill, that didn't happen. All we got was a sorry and a free slice of chocolate cake for my son that turned 14 years old today! Then we had to wait another 45 minutes for our checks! We were there for a total of 4 hours! Everyone's food was good but the service SUCKED.  Everyone that was in our party are good people and believe that you should treat people the way you want to be treated we all paid our bill in full and most of us still left a tip, but I know that tomorrow we will be calling the corporate office to make sure that they know that we were not satisfied! Unless you like frustration I do not recommend eating at the P.F. Chang's."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. It was a bit of a wait (30 minutes) for a table. We kind of expected to have a long wait since it was a Saturday night. The food was good and the decor was nice. The seating was pretty tight so it felt like the couple sitting next to us was part of our private conversation. All in all we enjoyed our dinner and would consider dining here again."}
{"text":"While wandering the strip, my soon to be wife and I dropped in on PF Chang's while shopping and sightseeing. 

We weren't disappointed in the offerings.  The soup to start was mild, the spicy offerings were not as hot as expected.  

I should try the lettuce wraps next time, but I was hungry for heavier fare and had the Chang's spicy chicken.

Vinegar seems to the be the main ingredient here, and was disappointing unless you consider the odors I left wandering around the strip.

Avoid the spicy chicken.  Not very good.

The spring rolls were very standard fare, and I would much prefer the Vietnamese spring rolls served up at our local dim sum restaurant.

This seems to be a very \"Americanized\" version of chinese food, and despite having nice condiments ( sesame oil was a nice touch ) it doesn't make up for the sterile flavoring and overcompensation of vinegar put in the dishes."}
{"text":"Wait staff are really slow and disorganized. There are so many seats available but they just kept us waiting.
?Pad thai?a little bit too sweet?ginger chicken with broccoli?not so bad but way too pricy for the taste. its not fried but it still tastes heavy?dont know why?Dan dan noodle?r u kidding me?way too salty and its not even a little spicy. This is not Sichuan Dan dan noodle. its just ground chicken wiz salty sauce over noodle."}
{"text":"Terrible! Ordered take-out waited for 15 minutes at the bar to be acknowledged. I was told they were severely short staffed that day. Ordered my food online with extra spicy and four place settings. Neither was fulfilled. My takeout food was cold except the hot n sour soup. It was edible. The broccoli chicken dish was in a bucket of sauce and it was \"bland\" with hardly any broccoli. The eggplant dish was like eating soggy bread in a bucket of sauce. Both dishes had more sauce than food and not spicy at all. I guess they ignore the online instructions. I will never go to this PF CHANGS again. I'll travel the extra distance and go to the one next to Chandler mall. I have never had any problems over there."}
{"text":"the restaurant has a really nice vibe and atmosphere, good for dates, or any semi formal-casual occasion. 

i ordered the kung pao shrimp which is \"spicy\" but it tasted like deep fried shrimp soaked in chilli sauce..... 

the ma po tofu was too rich to my taste but nonetheless was still good. 

the pork egg rolls were bOMB. only reason why this is 4 stars tbh

Julie, my server was amazing, boxed up my left over food very professionally and gave great service. thank you !"}
{"text":"When you are hungry and want to avoid all the nuances of a high end restaurant then P F Chang's is the place to be if you are in a mood for a chinese meal. Food is delicious in this restaurant and the portions are generous. Restaurant has two floors. It is located in the Planet Hollywood's complex facing the Las Vegas Blvd. Lots of shopping is in its immediate vicinity.

I generally order the Chicken soup along with a spicy dish such as General's chicken and/or King pao chicken. The food is really consistent in taste and quality throughout the P F Chang's chain of Restaurants. I have no issues with the food quality and taste. The only area of opportunity is to get seated in a timely manner and the time it takes from ordering of the food to its delivery. During dinner hours there can be long waiting periods in the above categories. The pricing is economical and competitive with restaurants within its class."}
{"text":"Nothing new here, but still very consistent.  After a LONG day of conference and trade show, a group of colleagues and I wanted something simple and easy.  Changs is spot on for that.

This Changs is much different than most.  680 seats - yes 680.  Two levels.  I bet they turn the tables here 4 times on a busy night.  It's right off the casino floor.  

Food and service was typically good as it is at most PF Changs.  Great spot for business people and tourists wanting a great meal at a price that won't break your bank."}
{"text":"Never liked Chang's when we lived in CA.  But we've gone here twice at the happy hour time and enjoyed the starters on the menu.  Especially their pork egg rolls.

Had one dinner experience as well.  For Chinese dinners, I'll go back to Good China, thanks"}
{"text":"It has been years since I have been inside this PF Chang's.  We ate here for dinner on a busy Friday night around 15 years ago and I was very disappointed.  The food was definitely above average but the tables were so close together that it felt like we were having dinner with strangers.  No big deal-we like people but the table next to us was inhabited by a man who thought If he told his wife he wanted a divorce in a restaurant she would not make a scene. First off, I learned way too much about their personal life and secondly, he was wrong. She did make a scene. It just left a bad taste in my mouth (so to speak).  Well I should have gone back sooner.  The food is so so good.  Yesterday afternoon my daughter and I were planning our weekly lunch when she said she had a gift card so I decided to give them another try.  We went at a slow time of day and were seated at a nice comfy booth.   We ordered dumplings and crab puffs to start.   They were so good. Perfectly cooked and delicious.  If I were to be nit picky, one negative was that the lemon wedge on my daughter's water glass  had the sticker on it which would indicate that the lemon had not been washed before it was sliced. For our entrees, I had the Kung Pao Chicken and it was perfect. It is my favorite dish and this one was absolutely excellent. The chicken had just the right amount of crispy and was actually cooked perfectly.  My daughter had the Honey Crisp
Chicken and the portion of her meal was enormous.  She loved it and is going to get at least one more meal out of it.  We ordered another order of the Pot Stickers and we asked them to make the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce in to a spicy meal and pack both things up for me to take home to my husband.   He loved both and has enough left that I will not need to fix him lunch today!!! The service was good. Not great but good and we had a very nice afternoon.  Lesson learned do not wait more than a decade to go to this place because the food trumps any lack of privacy.   It did look to me as though there is more room between tables than there was back then but regardless,it was a great lunch."}
{"text":"Have picked up food here many times as a food courier. The staff has always been attentive, friendly, and helpful. Thanks."}
{"text":"I'd really like to give this place 2.5 stars because service was good; food...not so much. I hadn't been to any PF Chang's location in more than 5 years and after my meal here, I remember why. 

A large group of us went out for a colleague's last day. The waiter was efficient and took our orders quickly. He even asked if we wanted separate checks and was very accommodating. No problem there. He was great.

I ordered the lunch size chicken satay with the side salad. Peanut sauce came on the side. The first piece chicken was tender but the peanut sauce was under whelming. I kept dunking just to be sure I had enough sauce on the chicken but it was still lacking in flavor. The second piece of chicken was full of fat and just had a weird texture. I didn't eat it. On to the side salad which should have been fresh and crispy. The menu promoted it as \"fresh\" and it was anything but. It was wilted and not appealing at all. 

Lunch with my colleagues is always fun, but I'd like to get my money's worth. PF Chang's was a disappointment. Will likely be another 5 years before I try it again."}
{"text":"One way I judge a restaurant is by how well they recover from mistakes.  My 5 stars is for the way this location's manager, John, recovered from an error their kitchen made.   A well run restaurant acknowledges when it has made a mistake and addresses it promptly and positively - which is exactly what John did.  Because of this PF Chang's service leadership - I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Been here many times. First horrible meal. They changed their menu and must have changed the way they make their noodles. DanDan noodles were returned. Chewy starchy and not pleasant to eat. The pork lo mien was also returned. Same reason. Mongolian Beef with broccoli was still awesome. Tried pineapple pork from seasonal menu. Just okay.  Should probably go back to the way it was."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today, restaurant was clean and everyone seemed friendly and the food was pretty good. We'll probably return if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of our favorite places to eat. They have an amazing Gluten Free menu and the service (especially the staff at the bar) are outstanding. They remember us when we go there and remember what we like to order. Also their points program is great. We get a free meal every couple times we visit. Never had a bad meal or experience."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent,  and our server honored all my requests.  She also let me box my own food. Wontons and Fried Dumplings are awesome!!  Drinks are very good as is the sesame chicken.   Only downfall was the chocolate dome dessert was a bit disappointing *mushy and lack of good flavor*.   The service is very attentive.
(P.S.  Warning - fried rice costs extra $$)"}
{"text":"Service was great! The food was salty! It reminded us why we don't go there. Everything taste the same because it has the same sauce. The PF Chang's special chicken was soggy. No crisp at all. 

Only reason this place got three star because of service and atmosphere. Food needs to be less salty."}
{"text":"I brought my parents here for happy hour. A little background, my parents never go out to eat. Their extent of going out to eat is fast food or this casual vietnamese place. This was considered outside of their comfort zone. Also my mom is a very picky eater. I didn't hold out much hope she would like it but thought there would be a few things that would be palatable for her. 

This was a real treat for me to be able to take my parents out to a restaurant that wasn't fast food. The staff was super accommodating. There wasn't any room at the bar and the patio was much to hot to be sitting outside on a summer day in Arizona. The staff made an exception and let us sit in the dining room and made the happy hour menu available to us.

I was able to persuade my mom to splurge and have a glass of wine. She is afraid of drinking because of medication she is on. She's so apprehensive that she won't even drink if she takes ibuprofen, so she's quite extreme in that regard. I ordered the asian pear mojito, it was delicious as usual, though the glass seemed to be smaller than I recall. This was served in a highball glass when before i recall it being served in a beer on tap glass. I understand, smaller servings, same price, inflation.

My dad got a carbonated beverage and the refill came even before he got low on soda. Our waitress Megan was quite friendly and very attentive. We ended up packing up on of our items and she had put extra sauces in the bag for us, that's planning ahead. 

We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, chicken lettuce wraps, pork and chicken street tacos, and shrimp dumplings. Everything was delicious. Though the calamari was average with us. The texture of the calamari tasted too soft and the dipping sauce was not so great. It was sweet, not a good compliment to the salt and pepper calamari. the street tacos were served on a jicama shell. A great alternative to the typical corn or flour tortilla shell.

My mom has even talked about returning soon which is a rarity for her. Any place that my mom can like, is ok in my book. The food was to her liking and the service as well. Next time, we will be sure to come early enough to get a seat in the bar area"}
{"text":"A must try is the orange peel chicken, A +. This is a very busy location so it can get loud during dinner but the service is still good."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up our takeout and the lady didn't even have the order packaged into the bag. She decided to read over our whole order to an audience of people, then proceed to drop the whole bag of take out..not even checking to see if it was ok. The order even said specifically to include fortune cookies, which they also decided to leave out.
I have had good luck with P.F Chang's in the past, but today was really unacceptable."}
{"text":"Lord smite me now, cuz I never thought I'd see a day where I'd give L'Atelier Joel Robuchoun two stars and PF Chang's a three, but karma dictates that I follow up a crap review with a glowing one, which is what my review of PF Changs at Planet Hollywood on the Vegas Strip is all about.

Now, I KNOW PF Chang's is about \"fusion\" (read - fake) Chinese/Asian food, and I KNOW they're a chain, but they have tasty (albeit really salty) food, at reasonable prices - even on the Vegas Strip.

During our four-day stay, we dined here twice - once late night for some noodles and egg rolls; and the second for happy hour (3:30pm to 6:30pm).  The first experience, when we sat in the dining room on the main floor, was OK, but the second time, when we sat at the upstairs (YES, THERE'S AN UPSTAIRS BAR) with bartender Brandon, our server, was even better.

Without a doubt, Brandon was the most sincere and professional service person we've met up on our Vegas trip.  Everywhere you go on the Strip, from the baristas at Starbucks to the guys hustling shows on the overpasses to the check-in clerks at your hotels - people are wanting something from you (ie. Tips) and you get fake, effusive service as a result.  Not Brandon.  He was swamped with drinks, being the only bartender for the entire two-floor restaurant, but kept his humor and gave us great service.  We had HH chicken lettuce wraps (always great), northern style spareribs (just ok), and egg rolls (just ok), as well as the Organic Agave Margaritas, which were great.  (And cheaper during HH!)  I'm so glad our last night in Vegas was spent at that bar with Brandon; he made the experience of being there a little more memorable."}
{"text":"I love this place, the atmosphere, food, drinks are all AMAZING! if you love chinese food AKA oriental food then you need to come check this place out because its awesome. The price is very reasonable and i highly recommend the Mongolian beef (or is you don't eat beef and eat chicken get mongo chicken its pretty much amazing) Crispy green beans, and dynamite shrimp to everyone who goes there. A+ Restaurant!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Me: Just not great. Everything is crunchy and/or sweet, thereby making it palatable to 99.9% of Americans. For real Chinese food, not to mention money and effort, we eat elsewhere. 

Him: Eccchh! The food is not so good. They use too much oil and you burp a lot after you eat there. There are no Chinese people."}
{"text":"Solid performance overall: fresh food, well prepared but somewhat uneven performance. Food definitely tasted fresh from the wok and dish compositions are enticing/interesting, but sauces could be a bit strong/over-powering. My husband always appreciates the standard PF Changs make your own sauce in your table thing. Ambiance at PF Changs is always great and this was on the quiet side for lunch with staff being friendly and attentive. The location next to the river in downtown Scottsdale is quite nice."}
{"text":"WOOHOO - Shoutouts to the Mongolian Beef!!  

We had never tried a PF Chang's before, and, were delightfully surprised!  Found out after they are new to Canada, and, have opened a location in Toronto (which we are going to try after our experience in Vegas).  

Our waiting was cool - young kid from Oregon, working in Vegas.  The crowd there - eclectic.  A little bit of everything.   

Our server made the PF Chang 'secret sauce' right at our table for our Spring Roll appetizer.  

The 'piece de resistance' was the Mongolian Beef - our entree.  WOW!  Taste explosion!  (and apparently what they're known for)

It's Americanised Chinese food - not authentic, but, still delicious.  Know this going in (for any food snobs - I like traditional Chinese food, as well).

This was one of my favorite meals in Vegas, and, you don't have to break the bank.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Poor service!!  Food was mediocre and spare ribs over cooked.  Lazy food preparation.  Broccoli in sautéed vegetable stir fry had whole crowns!!  Do you expect us to do your work for you?  Tables around us left un-bussed the whole time we were there.  They never even bothered to refill our glasses of water.  We had to constancy request for our waiter.  Never coming back here again!"}
{"text":"PF is probably one of my favorite restaurants out there. For one, they offer a nice gluten free menu and the food is always great. I have eaten at MANY different locations. We have many lunch meetings for work and take our clients to PF Changs all of the time. It has always been the one restaurant to never disappoint me. Well until now. Me and my family recently moved and this is the closest location to us. I will never eat here again! The service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress skipped over us, our food took over an hour with the excuse that gluten free entrees take longer. Yea well not at any of the other locations. The food tasted great as always but I would way rather take the drive to another location to get better and faster service. Especially with hungry little ones. Never again."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised on my first visit to P.F. Changs in Beachwood.  I was somewhat concerned after reading Yelp reviews which seem to have a common thread of inconsistent service and TV dinner style heated meals with no appeal.  

They ROCK!  Our server Haywood, was attentive, pleasant, interactive, and kept an eye on our needs.  The seasonings burst through creating a delicious medley of highly satisfying flavors.  

I ordered the Vietnamese Noodles with Beef & Shrimp which has an incredible mixture of  hoisin, sirachia, cinnamon, coriander, and other flavors placing it in a category held by authentic Pho restaurants.  Bravo. 

The Gluten Free Ginger Chicken with  Broccoli was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor.  The sauce was delicious and rivaled or exceeded non-gluten free versions. Awesome.  

The Street Noodles and Shrimp Fried Rice mixture also provided an example of well thought out and executed Flavor and texture.  Lets put the Street Noodles just ahead of the rice.   Sensational combination.  

The Bartender or whoever prepared the Three Olives Cherry Vodka with Ginger Ale gets an A+.   Superb flavor and balance. 

Total of 4 stars due to the dessert. The Tiramisu was small, bland, overly creamy, watery, and not very flavorful.  The Gluten Free Flourless cake did not meet our expectations. I guess it's ok if you like a fudge style lump of chocolate.  Not fluffy. 

The ambiance was cozy, intimate, and very comfortable.  Our wait time as minimal as we had made reservations earlier in the day.  

Treat yourself to the experience and you will make plans for future visits. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service, took awhile for a table but what do you expect for a table of 15 in Vegas.. Love that it's in Planet Hollywood!"}
{"text":"Today I visited for my mom's birthday and the pepper chicken was amazing! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I was forced to come here by a friend who was craving the food....yes...that's right....forced....The usual chain restaurants aren't my cup of tea to eat at but I guess that's what friends are for.
The food here....ehh....I have definitely had better!!
The Kung Pao Shrimp left something to be desired and the usual chicken lettuce wraps which they are famed for left a little funny taste in my mouth. Not to mention the lettuce was very dry and the chicken wasn't flavorful!! Icky!! Definitely won't be first on my list of places to go when I am in the mood for Chinese. Oh, well....at least they had a great drink list to satisfy my palate!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, but service was horrible. Appetizer plates were never cleared, entrees arrived but we didn't have any silverware and had to take them from the table next to is, water was never refilled, server gave us our check before we even got our dessert. Don't think I will ever come back"}
{"text":"First time visiting a PF Changs and loved it. Food was great and our server Blaz was one of the best servers we have had."}
{"text":"Went out for a nice dinner date. We were asked if we wanted to sit upstairs and had to walk upstairs and wait halfway on the stairs for the hostess. One thing I thought was a little bad becase what of elderly people in the middle of the stairs?
Anyways, we were seated very fast and our server Daisy was awesome. It took the drink person a while to get our drinks but Daisy was always there and made sure we were sattifsfied. We ordered 3 entree;s to share and about 10 margaritas lol the pomegranate margaritas were the BOMB!

Price is fairly high, being on the strip and stuff... but oh well. it was GOOD"}
{"text":"I went to P.F. Changes with a friend for my birthday at the recommendation of a coworker of mine.  He suggested I make a reservation as he stated they tend to be busy for dinner.  I took his advise and booked it but didn't do it until 2 days before hand, but I was still able to get a time within 15 minutes of the time I originally wanted so not bad.

It wasn't hard to find the place, my friend and I walked around window shopping before hand and window shopped afterwards which is nice to be able to take a little stroll after a meal.

When we got there the waiter asked if he had ever been there before, which I hadn't but my friends had.  When the waiter discovered it was my birthday he offered me a free desert which was really nice and unexpected.  I received a $10 gift card and another reward stating if I did the survey within 7 days I'd get a free appetizer upon next visit also.  The survey and gift card were for my birthday and because it was my first time going there.

They did a lot to make sure I'd be happy my firs time around.  I thought it was very nice of them.

And when the waiter suggested their special apple martini which I thought tasted gross, he had the bartender whip up a new one that I liked, and let me keep the other one free of charge.  I thought that was nice also that since he was the one that suggested the drink, he was willing to correct the mistake and let me keep the drink free of charge.

Overall it was nice, the food was delicious, the place looked clean, the staff was friendly.  Even the manager came over to say hi and thank us for choosing them.  I'd go here again for sure."}
{"text":"Better than average Chinese food but pricey. We usually only come to pf chang's with a bogo entrée. Prices are about $15 per meal. I feel for the price, you should get a lot more. You also don't get soup or egg roll or fried rice so have to pay extra for each. Service and atmosphere has always been good."}
{"text":"Such great customer service. Even after only going there a couple of times, the staff knows me by name and greets me. They even know my drink order. Great place to go!"}
{"text":"So it's a chain.  I like it.  Who is making up these unwritten rules that we can't dine at, write about, or enjoy a chain restaurant anyway?

I actually come here primarily when my mom is visiting because she likes it.  So do a few of my Flagstaff friends.  I've found the food is always prepared well, the service is always great, and the prices are reasonable including drink prices.  Oh and now they have these cute little dessert minis for $2.00 each.  I didn't indulge since we had a birthday cake at home, but for $2, I can try everything that looks good!"}
{"text":"Dined here with my Mom during our road trip recently. I am really not a fan of P.F. Chang's due to their heavy-handedness with their sauces/saltiness. Good thing we had a gift card to give it another go and I requested to be light with the sauces: soy sauce/hoison, etc. Mom and I very much enjoyed our food. Lettuce wraps are a huge hit with P.F. Changs. I also enjoyed their \"steamed\" shrimp pot stickers. I like my sauce with scallion and lemon grass for a tang, so it was missing that for me in the light dipping sauce. The sauteed spinach to our preference to perfection of being lightly sauteed versus overcooked and limp. 

We very much enjoyed the decor and design of this location. Very classy, elegant  and I loved the architect and chinese artwork that flowed. The enormous lighting fixtures are something to admire along with the deep dark earthy wood throughout the place. 

A big kudos and a whoop whoop to our Host & Waiter: Memo! We appreciated his service along with \"It's a small world after all...\" The dude is originally from the same city I grew up in...Lawndale, Calif. Seriously?! I was tripping out when he said he is from their and my Mom and I were cracking up! If you only knew...the city is small and definitely a small world. Totally, tripped out! I will have to keep this P.F. Changs booked marked. I preferred the dining her than that of Pacific Buffet, not a fan."}
{"text":"In a town where a mere hot dog or a slice of pizza can run you $6.75, it's a welcome change to get a full meal at a standard price. The PF Changs in Planet Hollywood can be found right in the casino. As mentioned previously, prices here are standard like any PF Changs around the country. The food was good. We dined around 11pm and it looked like things were slowing down after that timeframe. Our waitress was kind and helpful. Not a bad place to dine when in town."}
{"text":"Finally I decided to check pf Chang of las vegas( on Charleston Blvd) . It was order of fried rice, beef and chicken. I always liked these food in in the cal store. I was really disappointed with fried beef. I have never seen beef like this any bf Chang and none in any Chinese rest. Beef was was in big pieces and was cooked separately and added to dish. It was so hard and unbeatable so we through away. Chicken fried rice was good. I don't believe in their chef is Chinese but whoever is has no clue about Chinese food. I am planning to go there in three weeks with my guest from other state and I have to make sure every one stays away from beef ."}
{"text":"Once again my wife will give this 5 stars.  The only reason not to is lines and cost.  4.5 stars....  Amazingly good food and their chocolate cake is crazy...This is a great restaurant to impress the ladies with on a date.  But for the price you better like her."}
{"text":"As always, the food was quite similar to other PF Changs I've visited across the country. I went for the shrimp noodles while my folks had the Lo-mein noodles with vegetables. The Lo-mein was great, good flavour. The shrimp noodles has great flavour, but it was deep fried shrimp, something I didn't realise while ordering, so it was a little oily. But overall good food.

P.S. - Our server, Jay, was a delight."}
{"text":"The chef is amazing and talented. The lettuce wraps were Devine my favorite on the menu. The waitress had great suggestions for drinks and dinner choices."}
{"text":"Salt is jumping for joy in this place. I mean... if they had a mascot, it would be salt in a salt shaker and the shaker would have the biggest happy face you've ever seen.

I usually don't do the chain restaurant thing, but this PF Chang's is close to my residence and it was later in the night so it was the only thing open. It was an hour before closing when we arrived, were greeted politely by the hostess, and were seated on the patio. I noticed the serving did an \"Oh great\" type gesture when the hostess informed him we just sat down (I get it dude, it's an hour till close). He came over to us within a few minutes after that and said he'd be right with us. About 7 minutes later, he finally came back... He was friendly and didn't really rush us through the time we were there.

I ordered a glass of the Moscato (which wasn't as sweet as I expected). He asked for my I.D. and gave me \"condolences\" on my birthdate... which is 9/11. \"Agh....\" I'm used to it, but come on now... It's been how many years now?? Jeeeeez. Anyway, he tried to recover by saying he had a birthday one year that was very unlucky according to the date, I think he said 9/9. Um, awesome.

Moving on.... We ordered the Calamari appetizer, which wasn't anything extraordinary. It was a bit salty, but the sauce they bring with it was sweeter so it kind of washed that out. We ordered the Japanese Street Noodles... Hooollllyyy salt! It was THE most salty dish I have ever tried that I ended up taking a few bites and was done. I. Just. Couldn't. Luckily my date was hungry enough to eat most of it. We had the rest of the noodles boxed up, and tried to get out of there as quickly as possible since they were starting to close up. 

Soooo... Only reason why I would go back is due to having three \"free appetizer\" vouchers.. Hmm, maybe I'll just give them away instead? I want to give two stars, but I think three would suffice since it wasn't an awful experience? :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite PF Chang's locations because the decor looks different than the one at Arrowhead and the one at Keirland Commons in Scottsdale. The decor is very unique compared to the other ones. I love the tall ceilings and floor to ceiling windows adorned with floor to ceiling lush curtains. One wall of the restaurant is a giant Chinese water color glass art work that's is entirely backlit, which is quite an impressive feat for such a tall and large wall. 

The staff is quick, courteous, and very informative. 
I hadn't been here in awhile, so I was happy to know they still had the Banana fried egg rolls for dessert served with rich coconut ice cream!

The mongolian beef mixed with sauteed green onions has always been my favorite and usually it's been hit-or-miss with tenderness at the different PF's I've been to. However, here, they have nailed the mongolian beef. It was tender and flavorful!

The Spicy and salty shrimp is a more authentic dish and I was surprised it was even offered here at PF's, but it was very good here even though it had a more modern twist involved. when you order this dish at traditional Chinese restaurants, you eat the tail too, since the shrimp is so fried, it becomes tender - like soft shelled crab is. At PF's, it seems lighter and flakier rather than overly fried, so it wasn't as approachable to eat the shrimp tail in this case. 

We also tried the Thai fried rice, which contained lumps of crab, cilantro and some other spice within. This was super spicy and tasty! We loved this since it was full of so much spice.

Another surprising addition to the menu was sushi of all things! First Chinese restaurants adoped the Japanese dish, Teriyaki chicken, into their menu. Now, Chinese restaurants are including sushi too? It's crazy hilarious to me! Nor does it matter... You can have your cake and eat it too without having to go to two different Asian restaurant types..."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, our service was great. The hostesses checked us in and got us seated faster than fast. Our server, JARED, was amazing. Someone in our party can't have spicy and ordered an entree (without the chili pepper symbol) but just to be sure, Jared brought him over a small side of the sauce for him to try. That was SUPER mindful of him to do. We didn't like a certain tea, he whisked it away and was back out with a different beverage in about 2 minutes (if that!) This was my first time here but with this service and food quality, it won't be my last. THANK YOU for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Great place to bring a group to. what made this experience great was the bartenders and staff. They where unbelievablely nice and curtious. I approve of this location.  And joe the bartender makes great drinks."}
{"text":"I have always heard of PF Changs but I must say I was underwhelmed. The service was good but honestly the food was just average. I went for a birthday dinner and tried many appetizers they we okay. I like the fired green beans the best. I then ordered the surf and turf with lobster. The steak was good but the lobster was fried up into these tiny little chewy pieces. It  just was not what I had expected. I will not be going again."}
{"text":"We happened to be in town and had a gift card for PF Chang's so we decided to have dinner here. It was Mother's Day and the wait time for a table was an hour. We needed to catch a flight and they offered immediate seating at the bar even with our daughter who is a minor.  We had dinner and non alcoholic beverages which were excellent.  The bartenders provided excellent and friendly service.  We ordered my favorite chicken lettuce wraps, lo mein, ma po tofu, and tuna tataki. Food was served quickly and everything was delicious.  There was a lot of food left however we were unable to take it since we were traveling.  We were able to enjoy our meal and make it to the airport in plenty of time.  We have dined at other PF Chang's locations and will continue to do so in the future."}
{"text":"When you don't have that many options on Christmas Eve, this was a safe bet.  The food was a bit on the sweeter side of Americanized Chinese food. 

The egg drop soup and the spare rib starters were actually quite tasty. I wouldn't order the crispy honey shrimp or the sweet and sour pork again.  the chocolate peanut butter dessert was tasty.  

Service was excellent, of course, that's what this Chain promises.  Middleton is a chain food paradise - we'd come back again, but likely not above our other local favorites - Fugu, House of Mei (in Sun Prairie), and other places near State Street in Madison."}
{"text":"Under cooked rice. Being a Asian we like our rice well done. The food was blah blah. The lettuce wrap sauce gave me blister in my mouth. Has that happened to anyone? But the waiter was really nice."}
{"text":"p f chang's always has decent food and is consistent in all of their restaurants so the deal breaker is the service i suppose.  the waiter dude here had no idea what was goin on.  he forgot drinks, messed up orders, and didn't make the custom sauce every p f chang's waiter must make.  at least the chicken lettuce wraps were good."}
{"text":"I had not been here in like 2 years, and then all of a sudden I was here twice in a week. First for a lunch with coworkers and then for dinner and movie with friends.

I had the idea that PF Changs is kind of pricey, but it seems all the meals are big enough to share, or have leftovers. Also, a huge bowl of hot and sour soup (my favorite) is less than $6, so now that I am paying attention to the bill it seems to be OK.

During these 2 visits I tried the following:
Hot an sour soup (yummy!)
Egg drop soup (OK)
Wontons,
Kung pao shrimp (yummy) and chicken (OK)
Some special thai coconut noodles with chicken (OK)
Some thai pad something : ) - (OK)
Szechuan pork (I think, yummy) and othe 2 chicken dishes I do not remember the name. Kind of sweet.

Desserts:
Tiramisu, chocolate cake, some chocolate cake with peanuts or peanut butter, lemon cake, and some sort of fried bananas with ice cream. 
My favorite is the lemon cake, but the fried bananas were very good as well.

Warning - I was very disappointed that they do not have the shot glass desserts anymore... they were my favorites. : (

Servers were very good and friendly both times. For lunch our server was a tall guy with very short hair, I do not remember his name but he was very enthusiastic : ) He kept forgetting to bring me lemons, but I give him points for being so energetic.
For dinner our server was Kasey, he was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Never been to a PF Changs before, went to team dinner here and enjoyed it.  Served quickly, had yummy fresh ginger beer to drink.
We shared apps, green beans were nice, calamari was blah and chicken satay was too rubbery.
Entrees arrived, beef and broccoli tasted ok, beef was on the rare side though.  Sweet and sour chicken was nice and walnut honey shrimp was nice.
Nice atmosphere and subtle lighting was nice."}
{"text":"Ok, after my horrendous food experience with the take out food from this establishment I wrote the corporate office who sent me a nice note and a gift certificate to retry the restaurant. Which I did. The service and waitress was nice and attentive, however the food is still lacking. This chain used to be a top notch dining experience for Chinese chain upscale restaurant. However, the cooks at this restaurant has gone steadily downhill in the last two years so I think they must have had a change in their kitchen. The egg drop soup was fine, nothing great. My daughter's sesame chicken was passable, a little tough, she did not eat half of it (which she loves). My salmon was dry and flavorless with the filler rice. The waitress did not go over the sauces and that used to be a big service flavor enhancement. The won tons were good. I do not think I will go there again without a gift certificate. Honestly, Panda Express tastes just as good at this point. A disappointing end to a previously well loved restaurant. Too bad, I hope they change cooks."}
{"text":"Great service and really good food, but one big complaint that keeps me from going often and that's ,how do I put this delicately, bad bad bad gas for two to three hours after I'm done. I don't know what they put in their sauces, but it is toxic. My poor kids die on the way home after PF changs!! Ha Ha"}
{"text":"I am embarrassed to admit that I actually like PF Changs.  A lot.  Chinese food is generally too greasy for me, but this actually tastes healthy.  Plus, I could drink the sauce that comes with the lettuce peanut wraps, i think it's so tasty."}
{"text":"They were so nice to us when we picked up food on the way home from the airport (and were late because we made a wrong term).  PF Chang's is comfort food for me.  I always like the orange peel shrimp, the hot and sour soup, and the szechuan asparagus."}
{"text":"Rude unwelcoming short haired black hostess. Drinks were not good. Greasy spring  rolls 

Below par on every way.  No experience needed to work here"}
{"text":"Love this PF Changs! Joe \"so fresh and clean\" my self appointed bartender provides serious service. Orange Ginger Edamame rock and I always dig on the lettuce wraps with a double dose of chili paste in the trio set up.

{"text":"So I was eating my leftover wonton soup today & found a nicely trimmed finger nail twards bottom of my bowl of soup. Thanks Changs but next time let me know you added extra ingredients :)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that while the food isn't bad it's the service that makes this place worth going to. 

I just landed back in Pittsburgh and my mother wanted to do an early dinner after I got to the hotel. We went straight to this place, a spot we'd been to before, with the intention of trying their four course prix fixe menu. 

Started with egg drop soup, which is neither good or bad. Personally, I'd go for plain old miso and be happy. Next was appetizers, chicken lettuce wraps plus the pork dumplings on as extra. The lettuce wraps are a guaranteed hit for me, the pork dumplings were just okay. I'd have to try them again to be sure. They were skimpy with the lettuce, but the waitress brought us more lettuce without us having to ask. My main course was the the Asian grilled salmon. Huge piece of salmon with asparagus. The salmon was tender and absolutely delicious. Dessert for me was the salted caramel cake. Discovered this gem when I went to PF Changs in Monterey and I'm hooked.  

The waitress made this visit for me. Mom wasn't sure she wanted soup so the waitress brought her out the egg drop and the hot & sour soup (she didn't like either). I got a pink cherry Cosmo (hated it), she saw I didn't like it so she added sprite and made it taste so much better. She was quick, thoughtful, knowledgeable about the menu, and friendly. We tipped the 20%, but I wish I'd have tipped her more. Food was good, but she made the visit better."}
{"text":"Bad bad experience. I was going to say one of the worst experiences I have had at PF Changs but I'm going to change it to one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant. My friend, her daughter and I just got back from there. The wait wasn't bad until the host called my name just to tell us our table wasn't ready they were cleaning it. 12 minutes later I went up to ask and they said they were just cleaning it right now. Why call me at all then? We sat down my friend ordered a glass of wine. We were quickly served our Coke and iced tea but almost 20 minutes later she still did not get her glass of wine. I finally had to ask another server for it because we had never seen our server John again. That server brought it within a minute. Finally our food came but her daughter's Mongolian beef came without rice. John said it was still being cooked and would take a few minutes. She sat and waited for it not touching her food. Didn't see John again. When he finally appeared I asked and he spun around like he completely forgot it. At least when we sent her whole meal back he took it off the check."}
{"text":"The food was great. Our Waiter was great. He was a Gentleman with a nice sense of humor. It was happy hour and the restaurant was busy. He busted his hump to serve his tables and never let us down."}
{"text":"I typically like P.F. Chang's but the experience we had at the planet Hollywood location was less than ideal. 
The server brought us a full bottle of champagne when we had clearly asked for 2 glasses, she didn't offer to take it off the bill or change the order. 
She went missing on more than one long occasion! 
The food was good (average like most PF Changes) but the service gives this location 2 stars! 

Server who didn't pay attention and could care less! Shame"}
{"text":"Great location. Food was really staff. Large menu to choose from. Fast. Great bar. Lots of drinks. Windows everywhere. Can sit and and people watch."}
{"text":"It's a chain but they have amazing service and delicious food.  The portions seem to vary depending on how busy they are, but they're never tiny.  Go with an appetite and a friend (or many) so you can share dishes!"}
{"text":"I eat at the PF Chang's in The District at least once a month and am huge fan of the menu at this chain. The service is usually top notch, but my experience at this location was worth yelping about. 

The hostess decided to look at me after I stood in front of her for two minutes. She told me the wait would be 45 minutes. Since I was meeting a long time friend for a concert I didn't mind..... 

We waited, waited, and waited some more. We ended up waiting over an hour and fifteen minutes! The hostess was rude when we went up to check on it. She made us feel bad for asking. When we were finally taken to our seats we had to wait a while for our waiter. I'm getting used to all of this waiting by now even though I am starting to get hunger pains. No big deal. 

We order and the waiter comes out with the sauce. Don't they usually do the sauce spiel every time? Maybe I'm just spoiled and use to the good service at the GV location. Regardless, he just poured the sauce and left. When we got our food the rice was the exact opposite of sticky rice. In fact, it was hard and resembled uncooked rice! Unbelievable. The good news was that the Dan Dan Noodles were out of this world! The distinct flavor of the cucumber cut the heat from the chile paste perfectly. The waiter did not ask if we wanted them cut. The Mongolian Beef was also a big hit. The meal would not be complete without their famous lettuce wraps which were delicious as usual. 

Overall I was satisfied with the food and the presentation minus the uncooked rice. It's PF Changs, who doesn't enjoy the food? The staff, however was really rude and unprofessional and my guest and I were highly put off by this. Next time I am at this hotel I am going to the sandwich shop and sticking to my PF Changs in Green Valley."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, i live ther mascow mule. Awsome service at the bar.,,,, try the ribs, spicy asparagus, our bartender francesca is the best ask for her"}
{"text":"Worst Mother's Day experience ever. Of all the restaurant choices Charlotte has to offer, we certainly made the wrong one tonight. Reservations for 6:00, it is currently 8;00 and we still haven't been served. Poor management, the floors look as if they haven't been cleaned all day and the servers just keep complaining about how busy they have been all day. 

Think twice before spending your money here."}
{"text":"Get the lettuce wrap appetizer.
When they first opened the wrap was Boston or bib lettuce, now it is iceberg.

The rest of the menu is hit or miss"}
{"text":"Called in large $90 to go order for curbside, got there 10 min early waited till 10 min past time, never brought out order, won't go back, they don't really do curbside, we're others around them Cheesecake Factory , applebees ..... do real curb side service pull up they come out bring food then leave, here u must get there then call again,  I even spoke to manger  a hour later when they called and said they don't give good service u must call again. Will never go back"}
{"text":"I figured it was time for an update for this local (yes, local!) restaurant. Did you know that PF Chang's started in Arizona and in fact, this location is the flag ship restaurant for all the Chang's. That means this restaurant will have updates and changes to the menu before anyone else. 

This is a good option if you're looking for a decent meal with good service. You know what you're getting here because they have their concept perfected. We recently dined here and had Chas as our waiter. Chas is also a trainer and was not only very knowledgeable but also friendly and suggested tweaks to our food that made it even better. When you dine here, ask to sit in Chas' section!"}
{"text":"Second bad experience with service in a row. We were given old menus and when we went to order we were told items were not on current menu. Ordered drinks, but it took 25 minutes to get a Mojito. It finally came after entrees had been served. Served blamed the bartender. Then it took forever to get our check. When server did re-appear he stated that it would \"be awhile because of the gift card(with attitude). Dont think we will be back."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. It's in a nice area of town, the place looks nice and the servers and bussers are really nice. We ordered chicken lettuce wraps, calamari for appetizers and egg drop soup. For entrees we have the Mongolian beef, shrimp with lobster sauce, sweet n sour chicken. Everything tastes good and they serve good portions too but I like the one in planet Hollywood better because of the way they cook the Mongolian beef.mongolian beef here does not seem to be freshly cooked."}
{"text":"Always enjoyed their food here, we ordered chicken lettuce wrap, garlic shrimp with lobster sauce and Chilean sea bass everything is delicious! Our server Brandon was really nice and gave us free tiramisu because it's Christmas. It's a small portion but hey it's free! Love their tiramisu! Good ambience, right on the strip."}
{"text":"I had the Pad Thai. It was amazing!!! We ordered the spring rolls, fried green beans, and lettuce wraps. It was amazing!!! We couldn't handle the dessert so we took it home but it came highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Service and food here is terrific! My first time ever coming to changs and I so really regret not coming before now! 

Ordered the lettuce wraps and the pan seared dumplings as appetizers to start the evening. Both of them were delicious and had a great kick to the chicken wraps. 

For entrees we ordered the Korean chicken stir fry. The kimchi was an amazing contrast to the crispy chicken. Will definitely be back.

Also the plum wine will get yah buzzed quick!"}
{"text":"Once you get over the rather long wait at the bar, everything is really good. Saturday afternoon at 2 pm and the place was jammed. Got our usual chicken lettuce wraps (still so tasty), Asian BBQ ribs (meaty and OK), and entrees of honey chicken and salt and pepper prawns.  You may pay a bit more at PF's, but the food quality is consistently good."}
{"text":"Had dinner Thursday night; not very crowded around 7  pm, but there were people waiting to dine when we left. For those not familiar with PF's-it's upscale (pricier than local) Chinese/Asian. Lettuce wraps are a great way to start, very flavorful. Entrees were chicken with black bean sauce; plenty of chicken, not much else besides the sauce. It was fine but not bursting with flavor. My wife had the orange peel shrimp (her favorite salt & pepper shrimp is no longer on the menu). It had a bit of a kick and was flavorful. You have a choice of white or brown rice. Mojito cocktails were excellent, done with real lime juice. Also had a couple of glasses of wine; a chenin blanc and albarino that were surprisingly good and reasonably priced. We had a friendly, attentive server who made sure we would never have to  wait for a drink.

Bottom line 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Seems they're cheapening their menu though. Ordered a dish with shrimp and tofu. Got tons of tofu, and maybe 2 shrimp. Wait staff is good. Love going during lunch time. All the best dishes are normal sized and fairly cheap compared to the dinner menu."}
{"text":"I have always loved PF Chang's but they last two times at this location have been horrible. The first time was a month ago service was horribly slow and food was terrible.  Was in the mood for Chinese tonight. Thought I would give it another try tonight, we got take out instead of dining in. It was just as bad. The girl checking us out didn't know what she was doing. As far as our food is was horrible too..There was maybe a half a hand full of the crispy rice noodles with the lettuce wraps..Nothing was good. Order Egg Rolls, we didn't even eat those just because everything else was just so nasty. The worst 40 dollars I have spent in a while. I am better off going to one of the Chinese places in a strip mall."}
{"text":"This is all I have to say:
Mongolian beef, Shrimp fried rice, key lime pie martini
once again that is,
Mongolian beef, Shrimp fried rice, key lime pie martini

I have narrowed my PF Changs experiece down to this and am NEVER unsatisfied. The shrimp fried rice always has the perrrrfect amount of ingrediants that I never have to douce it with soy sauce and my mongolian beef is mouth watering perfection. Topped off with my sweet dessert martini. And if your in the mood, the lettuce wraps are quite yummy too.

Trust me, get these and be satified! It's capital D-licious!

p.s. I know it's packed in there sometimes but don't be afraid to sit at the bar, I LOVE sitting there everything comes out just in time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here often and the service and food are fine; however, on our last visit we were extremely disappointed. We asked to sit on the patio since it was 4:30 on a Friday and they were not busy. We were told that there was a large party and we couldn't sit outside. Less than 5 minutes later the hostess seated a two person couple outside. I have to question the ethics behind the hostess' decision to seat another couple in the same area we requested. Is this a normal practice for the restaurant to basically determine who is deemed worthy to sit outside. I'm extremely disappointed with the fact that now P.F. Changs has become elitist."}
{"text":"The food and bar service was good. However the management and the other wait service  as horrible. Our bartender was very busy and was able to keep up with her workload; however, my husband and I counted 8 employees just standing around doing nothing while she was obviously busy. In addition, the manager had a 30 minute conversation with some women while she was running around and we were looking for some silverware. There were superstar team members but the management of the restaurant was one of the worst ines I have ever seen."}
{"text":"The gluten-free stirfried rice was delicious.

The server, Juan, was attentive and friendly.

The atmosphere is contemporary with candles on the tables.

The music is upbeat.

We love it here."}
{"text":"This place sucks A$$!!  Service sucks, management, and  atmosphere!!  See ya, were staying clear of here. Rather go eat the buffet at Green valley ranch!!"}
{"text":"I have never been a big fan of PF Chang's but the one in Vegas used to be better then the rest, the food seemed to have more flavor. I know its a large restaurant chain and you should get the same product no matter where you go but this one USED to be better. We we were seated our waitress let us know that they have had allot of changes. The staff was all polite, and we were seated quickly because we had a reservation (45 min wait without one so call ahead. We after we ordered our food came quickly and looking forward to my meal i was disappointed because i learned what all the changes had been on my first bight. This PF Chang's was now just like the other PF Chang's that i had been to not much flavor in the food ( if you are going to put a warning on the menu the the food is spicy make it spicy not bland. If you like other PF Chang's you will enjoy this one too if you like flavor in you food this is not the place for you.  Overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"You must be wondering what an Asian was doing at PF Chang's...

My family had a gift card that they wanted to use so we went here for dinner last night. It's literally been ages since I've been here, and the menu seems to have changed drastically from what I remember. It was happy hour at the time so we ordered a few items off their happy hour menu as well including their signature chicken lettuce wraps, Hunan dragon wings, and spicy tuna roll. I didn't have huge expectations from this place, because well, it's Americanized Chinese food, an upgraded version of Panda Express. The spicy tuna roll was not very good (rice was hard), lettuce wraps were what I remembered them to be, but the wings were pretty flavorful. I also enjoyed the shrimp fried rice and the crispy honey shrimp (which was recommended by our waitress), but other than that, all the food was saltier than the Dead Sea. Expect your blood pressure to rise sharply after eating here. 

Despite the mediocre food, the service was some of the best I've experienced in recent memory. I wish I got our waitress' name (reddish-brown hair), because she at least deserves a shoutout here. She was very friendly and accommodating, and our drinks were never empty. It got fairly busy throughout the night as well, but she consistently checked in on us. Thank you for making our dining experience much more enjoyable. 

I'm not sure if I'll be back here anytime soon unless I have a gift card that I need to use, but please give the waitress a raise because she was the star of the night."}
{"text":"First we ordered a large bowl of Egg Drop Soup. It was very good.  We shared it and took the rest home.  MAdeline ordered the  Lamb Coconut Curry Plate and I ordered the Lobster and Shrimp Rice plate. We felt that all the food was delicious.  It was more than we could eat and we took the extra home."}
{"text":"Good Again

This time I will say the food was pretty good, although I must point out that every dish we ordered had an extreme heavy hand of salt! The service was comfortable."}
{"text":"Came on a weeknight and it was pretty busy, was also surprised of how many young children were in the restaurant...almost had a Chuck E. Cheese ambiance to it. Food is meh...I would stick just going to china town for better food and at probably half the price."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and never really had a bad experience. The setting is quiet and relaxing. I have never been disappointed with anything we have ordered and yes....they have sake bombers!

My favorite order is the starting with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps fallowed by the Shrimp with Lobster sauce. Just writing it makes my mouth water. If that doesn't sound like you thing, no worries. They have a very full menu and like I said, I have never been disappointed with anything else we have ordered.

If you have never been you need to go. I know some people try to stay away from chain food restaurants because they think they aren't as good as mom and pop places. I am telling you that this is not a chain food restaurant that disappoints."}
{"text":"Great gluten-free choices and like the new menu options!  Our server Patrick was great!!"}
{"text":"Oh well, at least there is a franchise Asian restaurant in the mistake by the lake. PFC is just so nicely decorated but the food is just so so. I'm biased because I travel to Asia (either China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan,  Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, etc) at least a couple of times a year. And only when I absolutely have to, like a gift card now and again, then I would eat there. At least it's better than some of the local Chinese takeout places where everything is cooked in the brown mystery sauce!"}
{"text":"Came in on this cold rainy day to warm up with a bowl of wonton soup. Usually stellar service with a personable outgoing bartender for the past 15 years I've come in here. I was solo and sat at the bar. The 30-something female bartender honestly had a less than stellar attitude. She asked if I wanted a menu, and I said yes. I asked her how her day was going and in a \"don't really give a sh*t\" tone she said \"It's going.\"    She is pregnant, so perhaps that's the reason for her less than stellar-ness with a \"non-regular.\"!Alllllrighty then. She goes off and talks to other people for minutes and finally brings me the menu. I have it less than 30 seconds and she returns and asks if I'm ready to order. I asked what the price of a certain drink was, and she looked at me as if I was asking her the dumbest question. She said \"Like 10-11 something I guess.\" Wow. I get my soup, and there's not a lot of wontons or veggies like there usually is. Bartender never once asked me if everything was okay, could she get me anything else, nothing. All the while she chatted with what seemed to be regulars. I grabbed my keys and wallet off the bar and she must have sensed I was
Finished eating. Never asked me if I wanted dessert, nothing. Cashed me out and put my bill on the bar without a word, but I got the fortune cookie on top. I just looked st bottom of receipt at the \"Gratuity Not Included.\" Indeed. Not today, Bartender Vicky (it was on the bill). If you don't like your job, then get a new one. Treat all customers the same, and don't pay special attention to \"regulars.\" Makes folks like me NOT want to return, ever."}
{"text":"Food was typical PF Chang's.. The staff was typical frat boy. Bro's talking about bro stuff loudly on the floor about 5 feet from my table. The kitchen staff was also pretty loud. The hostess, i am not exaggerating, just stood there and looked at us with her head cocked when we approached her. I stood for 10 seconds waiting for her to address us before I asked for a table. Because of this experience have made a promise to myself. I will no longer ignore anything and 'try it anyway'. When i see poor business culture/management, dirty floors, attitudes, dirty tables or even dirty menus I am leaving and posting 1 star reviews. I suggest we all do the same."}
{"text":"as much as i abhor chains, they have a kickass happy hour. especially when you have gift cards and then you can eat and drink for 2, with a bill of about 3bucks.

since i've yet to find any decent dim sum places in the valley, we tried their vegetable, shrimp, and edamame dim sum and it was good (yes, we've lived just a block from san francisco's china town and we've had great dim sum, so i've had some experience). the lettuce wraps are always a good go-to as well. 

no line for today's happy hour, but i'm sure next sunday it will be packed after their sponsored marathon. but i surely can't complain. the service, as usual, was excellent. like i said, great happy hour specials. i don't think i've ever eated a \"meal\" there though. will have to try!"}
{"text":"I am not typically one to gush but I'm going to just a bit. 
The food is a bit pricey but the coconut shrimp with honeydew is worth it. The gluten free menu leaves much to be desired as far as flavor is concerned but that is not abnormal.  Good food aside the service was excellent. Our server, Christopher B. was super attentive even though the restaurant was packed. He not only did his job but he went above and beyond to be helpful.  My friend has a gluten allergy and we typically have some trouble getting questions answered about the gluten content of condiments, etc when we are out to eat. Christopher asked in the kitchen, they were not sure about one of the sauces. This is the point at which most servers will decide that further investigation just reeks of effort but Christopher looked up the recipe so he could give us an answer other than \"I don't know\". When restaurants are busy and especially on Friday nights it is easy for some tables to get lost in the shuffle but we were very well taken care of. I made sure to call the manager to let him know about the great experience and will ask for a table in his section next time we go."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner at this location. The food was phenomenal. I eat at PF Changs pretty regularly and was very impressed by the food quality here. The service on the other hand was not so great. I don't know the servers name as he never introduced himself but he was tall with greying hair. He was present some of the time. I feel like we were not that important to him. Maybe because we are younger and typically the younger crowd doesn't tip as well but it's not always wise to pre judge people. When it came time to pay the check I left cash in the book and I've never seen a server move that fast to get to the check as we were leaving. Maybe he thought we were walking out on our tab, I don't know.  On our way out my wife waved and said thank you to him but we were met with only a blank stare. To the server:
I know it can be confusing when someone thanks you and tips you 20% despite your sub-par service but try not to show it next time. It's unbecoming. 
Overall I give this location 3 stars. 
Great job to the kitchen
Front of house needs improvement"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner last night. The food was awesome and our waiter, Oscar, was even more awesome. He was so attentive we almost felt like we were in his private kitchen. For sure we will ask for his section next time we're in town!!! Thank you Oscar"}
{"text":"Normally I don't have any issue with this PF Chang's or any others, but tonight our service was horrible."}
{"text":"So we went there last night for my bday. We had reservations at 645 and then had to change them to 715, when we got there they only made us wait about 2 mins to clean the table, which was nice!  Allison was our server, which we had her last time as well- super nice, once again:) Great service! 
I started with their Bloody Mary not spicy and my husband got a Fat Tire on draft. The bloody mary was sooo spicy even adding tomato juice hah so I ended up getting something else, which they were very accommodating. We started with the chix lettuce wraps, which were awesome as always, then I ordered the Changs spicy Chicken and my husband ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Rice. I was a little disappointed that the Changs spciy chicken seemed a little dry and I have gotten it in the past with success and the Shrimp and Chicken had 6-7 pieces of meat in it. Bummer. TONS of rice tho, you should see the bowl it comes in, so if you like rice with a taste of meat, its your meal, I wouldn't advise for men! Then they brought out a dessert shooter for my bday which was nice. I only had two bites and my husband ate it, which he loved. All together a good place to go, just bummed that the food was a little blah this time. The manager usually comes to the table and asks how everything was and what not, I would have told him our service was great but he was hanging out at the hostess station... but like I said all in all a cool place."}
{"text":"Wanted some food, but wanted to stay home as well; so I decided to try some PF Chang take out.  In my younger days there was only one in town (Flamingo / Paradise) and it was a guaranteed date night staple. 

Ordered the food online which was very easy and allowed you to select a pick up time.  Got there about 10 minutes early and the place was very well laid out, friendly staff, and the food was ready to go. This was a pleasant surprise, but the only one of the night.

Upon arriving home, I laid out the food, made my plate, and dived in with anticipation.  I must say my level of dissatisfaction only stopped before devastated due to the wine I was consuming.  The several different dishes that were ordered (see pictures) had no flavor, seemed thrown together,  and were all very bland.  The one dish I was most looking forward to, the chicken lettuce wraps, was no were near what I remembered. The chicken was overcooked and rubbery.  The different types of noodles all tasted like they were cooked with the same sauce. The food reminded me of the frozen food section, and not the great restaurant of days past.

Needless to say my food heart was broken as I felt I had met an old friend that had changed beyond recognition.  One star for the friendly prompt staff, well laid out environment, and ease of ordering; but that was the only highlight of this experience."}
{"text":"The service was great and the wait was pretty fast. I ordered a glass of SA Prum Riesling and the Ahi tuna salad. I love the wine and the service was friendly and quick. The salad was lacking flavor with a huge amount of lettuce. I thought it was just ok. I prefer the ahi tuna salad at the Yard House. I wish I had ordered the spicy shrimp appetizer instead it's one of my favorites instead I was trying to be healthy and the meal was a bit boring."}
{"text":"Ehhh. Haven't been here in years and figured we would give it a shot. We got takeout which may have been where we went wrong. The food was mediocre. For lunch we spent $30 on 2 meals and an appetizer. I feel that was a bit much for what we got. Won't be running back anytime soon. Perhaps I will give them another try in the future but I will eat in next time- although that should not matter when it comes to good food. Oh well."}
{"text":"You want fresh great tasting food hit up this spot and ask for Luis he wont let you down with customer service."}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with P.F. Changs.  The food, in my experiences, has always been consistent and tasty.  The service can be hit or miss at some locations.  As far as the Scottsdale, it was a nice experience.

This site is located within, or just around the corner from, a very nice shopping area (outdoor promenade).  Really nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Consistent. HIGHLY recommend reservation. Also, show up prior to reserved time. Somewhat chaotic. Food good with large portions. Reasonably priced for Vegas!"}
{"text":"I get there at 3rd for my lunch date and place not busy but we get sat at that weird half booth type table with 1 chair. So I sit on the booth side with my date. I guess I should have thought to ask if we should push 2 tables together because with all the condiments and stuff on the table I only get like 4 inches of the corner. The waiter announces how excited HE is because we're his last table. So his focus was on him I guess. It was a crummy experience and I'm sad about the decor and layout change. Next time I'll walk the restaurant and find a better roomier table or sit at the bar. Eating at the bar would have been more room."}
{"text":"I have to say that I actually liked this location.  It is much better than the Chandler one because it was upbeat and the food, if possible, seemed better.  The service is a little slow, though.   It was a good place to kick back with the co-workers."}
{"text":"We were celebrating our 49th wedding anniversary.  It was a huge disappointment.  The music was terrible and loud; the food was lukewarm; the service was extremely slow and no one asked if we were celebrating anything.  The lighting is also very bad.  You need a flashlight to read the menu.  Tea was not included.  The spring rolls were  very good.  I had shrimp with lobster sauce - kind of tasteless.  The sauces provided are way too hot.  My husband had a chicken dish - said it was ok but nothing special.  The prices were about average.  This isn't as good as our regular Chinese restaurant (Hong To) in Willoughby.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Our visit to PF Chang 06.14.17. We sat 15 mins before the server Austin came and even asked for drinks.  We placed the order along with drinks and mentioned all dishes need to be extra spicy. We also asked for the fire ring or fire cracker sauce.  When we got our food nothing was spicy and they didn't bring the fire ring sauce.  We didn't get plates to eat out from. After waiting a while for the waiter we just ate from the dish plate itself.  We just got 1 glass of water with no refills from our waiter. We love going to PF Chang but this experience  from our waiter was horrible. I guess we will not be visiting this location and stick with our Scottsdale location.  But again terrible experience for date night with husband after weeks of hectic schedule of work."}
{"text":"Expect no service. Don't expect to have your drinks or order taken at any rate. The place was pretty empty on a Tuesday night. We left this PF Chang's without anyone saying hello- except the host who seated us. I tried to call to talk with the manager but the phones are off the hook for now."}
{"text":"I've always liked it here, but the last few times it feels like everything is SO damn salty! 
Soups are always good, as well as tier chicken wraps. As for their entrees, way too salty. We ended up not being able to eat one of out dishes because of how it tasted :(
Such a shame."}
{"text":"Dam just went into restroom and one of the employees  throwing up in garbage can hope he is not a waiter can not eat after this good luck who ever have him or cleaning dishes"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this for a while and have kept forgetting, so here goes... I don't like writing bad reviews because I hate to judge a company based on a single bad experience. It was all pretty typical stuff at the beginning. There was a wait, so we sat at the bar & ordered food. But between that moment and when our food came out is when the problem started. Bartender's pals decided they would come up to the bar (specifically, the area where other servers typically pick up their drinks) and the three of them crowded it so the other servers could barely get in to take care of drinks for their own tables, and when they did his pals were constantly bumping into them. Not only this but they were just standing over people's drinks, not really wary of the fact that hair or spit could get in the drinks as they were talking. I might just be picky about that but I think that's disgusting. They took over my space, all huddled over my wallet and drink. Then proceeded to carry on highly inappropriate conversations with their bartender pal, as if  he wasn't working. 

From this point on, the only time he helped us was when he brought us our checks (quite a while after we had actually finished). While he was gabbing away about his weekend plans and girls and who's dating who (for about 30 minutes), someone else brought us our food, a bartender from across the bar came over just to re-fill our water, I had to grab another server's attention just so I could get silverware, and no one bothered to ask us how our meal was (it really wasn't terrific by the way, but that's beside the point). Meanwhile, he's pushing free drinks to his buddies. Then, worst of all, one of the bartender's pals reaches over and starts muddling a drink for him. NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! Who does this?! And who the heck lets him do it?! I certainly didn't see him wash his hands and he certainly didn't work there. Not cool dude!

Now, I realize P.F. Changs isn't exactly Ruth's Chris or some 5-star-chef restaurant. However, I still expect SOME degree of professionalism on the part of the staff. At some point, I expected the bartender to look over and say, \"hey guys, we're pretty busy. I'll catch up with you later.\" or maybe \"hey guys, why don't you come down to the other end of the bar  so we can talk\" (and you won't be in the way of other servers or crowding this part of the bar). The restaurant was on a 45-minute wait and the bar area was full- I'm sure he had better things to be doing at that time, instead of gabbing away and leaving the drink-mixing responsibilities to his fellow bartenders. He had responsibilities to his customers and the other servers in the restaurant, and he wasn't taking care of those responsibilities. Since he wasn't taking care of his responsibilities, other staff could have spoken to him or spoken to his pals, or a manager. If one of your coworkers is doing something that's obviously inappropriate, say something! Ask if he could have his friends move, or ask if he could help with something, just to give a hint that there are other priorities that need attention at the moment. If you're a manager and you see this going on, STOP IT! It is your responsibility to be aware of what is going on in your restaurant.

Worst. Service. Ever."}
{"text":"Haven't been to PFs in a while so my cousins and I decided to check it out over the weekend. This particular location is over in the District in Green Valley Ranch. The whole area preys upon dinners who want semi-upscale chain restaurants. I'm pretty sure the reason people even patronize PF Changs and the like is because they are expecting a uniform and consistent experience.

I know what to expect at Changs: glorified Panda Express at 3x the price, and if I had gotten that I would have been A-ok with it. Instead we got served up slop with a snooty attitude and terrible service. Our large party decided to order a few of the '2 for $40' Chang's feast specials. Pretty much you get soup, an app, entree and small dessert for two people for $40. Our party of eight told our server that we were doing the Changs Feast and his heart just sank. He probably wanted us to order a la carte to jack up the check, but after he took our orders he disappeared. We had to wave down bussers and other servers to simply get refills.

The food showed up in two waves, half the table got their food in a reasonable amount of time, the other half (including me!) had to wait another 20 minutes. The food that we did get was cold and we had to send it back and wait even longer. How the hell do you bring out undercooked Orange Peel Chicken? Its probably the most popular dish in the entire spot, y'all should be cooking it up in bulk considering how much of it you move on a busy day. 

This is probably a great example of why I hate auto-grat. Way too many servers simply don't give a eff because they know they are getting their 18% and want to do the minimum."}
{"text":"Lettuce Wraps are amazing! But I come here for the Mongolian beef. I have been to this place countless time at different locations and I have never been let down. Great food, atmosphere, and all around cohesion!"}
{"text":"1st time ever going to PF Chang's and my aunt wanted Chinese food so bad so we decided to try it out. We typically go to buffet style restaurants but with it being flu and cold season we opted to try here. The waiter was Ok but seemed less than pleased to have us seated in his area. He asked if we had ever been there before and we said no so I assumed he would have threw out a couple of suggestions. That didn't happen. He brought us drinks 20 minutes later and needless to say he never once mentioned \"Oh by the way those are not free refill drinks\". So I asked about the Mongolian beef and he raved about it so I ordered it well let me say it is way beyond salty. I sent it back and I definitely didn't order anything else. When the check came I still left a tip and once he saw that he became a lot more friendlier well hell we are getting ready to leave now. And on top of that the manager didn't even come out to speak to me about me sending the food back. 1st and last time I will ever come here again. 1st impressions are everything to me. would give it less than 1 but there's no option for that."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this restaurant is relaxing and comfortable. We had the lettuce wraps and then shared salmon and a beef entree, which both were fantastic. We would eat here every night if our diets allowed us! Our server was nice and the food came promptly. I recommend eating here if you like Chinese."}
{"text":"I had never eaten at a P.F. Changs until Tuesday night and quite honestly I wasn't that impressed. There was no line when we got there, maybe 10 people in the whole restaurant, went up to the counter to order and most of the stuff on the line was empty, I asked for teriyaki chicken, the girl huffed and then walked back to the kitchen, came back and said \"10 minutes\"  oookkk, so I asked for orange chicken and spicy beef instead, she then scooped sesame chicken on the plate and when I corrected her she acted as if \"I\" was the one who made the mistake.  I understand people have bad days, I work retail so I get it, really I do, but leave it at the door, don't bring your bad attitude to work. The food was ok, nothing to write home about. I'd be willing to try a P.F. Changs again but not this one."}
{"text":"I have been in the restaurant field for 15 years and I appreciate it when I see employees giving great service. Most of all great food. Waitress was very patient and also gave us some of her favorites here. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken extra crispy. My daughter ordered the shrimp fried rice. I totally recommend this place for locals and tourists."}
{"text":"The setting and the view were very nice, but after coming here I will never come back to a PF changs. The prices are WAY to much for what you get, and it really pisses me off when I can go down the street to Henderson and get better Chinese or Thai for a quarter of the cost. I know they are in a prime location here but the food is the same price in all the locations even the ones that are not prime. 

And the restroom is a five minute walk away which was very annoying 

The server was one of the best servers I've ever had. 

Come here for the experience and great customer service but don't come here for the food because it sucks!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The quality of food, service, and prices are all decent."}
{"text":"Good lord, the Chinese food here is totally dumbed down American style because it tastes nothing like Chinese! I swear their Kon Pao Chicken pass off as dog. The only thing I dug was the atmosphere for it's supposed to be tip top classy."}
{"text":"I love pf.changs everything they have is good and fresh. Not because I work there for four years is because I like the food period everyone's so friendly I still go back to this location cuz I still know people that work there and it's always fun to see a regular that I used to help like today"}
{"text":"I really do not know what to recommend here besides the lettuce wraps and the ginger chicken.  The lettuce of the wraps are very crisp and refreshing.  The ginger chicken is pretty good, but not to the point where it is \"Yay! I'm a fan!\"

I do really like the interior - it is a bit dim, but it's pretty modern."}
{"text":"Pf has always been our comfort food. Every Sunday we order take out and relax. Sunday June 22, we decided to dine in. Our waiter was nice, talked to much and didn't have an eye for detail. We ordered. My dish was sort of detailed, and needed to take out a few things in the end i ordered the pad tai. Once our order arrived, my boyfriend took a bight of my food. It was soooo spicy. He never mentioned i had an option to make it spicy or not (like i usually get when ordering online). So I asked for a different dish. They no longer have the double pan fried noodles on their menu, you can still order. I asked for beef and broccoli only on it. While it was being made, the manager came over. A snobby older woman i have never seen. Asked me \"So you probably never had the pad tai before, its suppose to be spicy.\" I stated i order this every week and its not ever spicy. She rolled her eyes and walked away. While waiting I was very upset. The waiter never brought me my rice or side dish and i was starving. for 10 mins i had to watch my bf eat and by the time i received my order, he was done. I took a glance at my dish and it had EVERYTHING on it. I was specific when i ordered. The waiter didn't say one word when he handed it to me and walked away. As i realized i was starving, i tried to pick off everything. It took me forever. the waiter came over and ask if it was good and i stated \" I only wanted beef and broccoli on my dish, and now i have to try to take everything off. and still haven't had a bite, so i will let you know\". He said \" my apologies\" and walks away. He comes back and i had 2 bites, but couldn't take out everything. So I didn't even want to eat it anymore. He tells us we get free dessert since my order was wrong. We were OVER IT. Asked for the check and he still charged me for my food. I think you should be charged if you get something that is completely wrong from what you ordered. And you eat it. Long story short, we tipped him 5% (which normally we tip 15% no matter if the food is bad) But because we didn't feel like he was really sorry or trying to help us, we gave him a few bux. Try to get a waitress that is older and looks like they have worked there awhile. Try to no talk to the older lady manger because you will get nowhere with her. After 5 years of going there, i will now only be ordering take out, since they never get it wrong!"}
{"text":"Dumb, dumber and dumbest are running the hostess stand. They gave me 7 different estimates on the wait time, none of which was accurate. John Tapper is needed on this property."}
{"text":"My visit here was GREAT! My server Anni was a joy!!! Very nice, attentive, and social. The food runner Lexi was also such a sweetie!

Best Moscow mule I've had in a while! They use fresh ginger as a garnish in the the drink! 
The pork dumplings and crispy honey chicken are always my favorite and this location did not disappoint! 

Reading previous reviews I was tempted not to come here but I'm happy I did! Everything was on point."}
{"text":"Went to eat dinner here tonight, Sunday, January 27, 2013 but left before we could get seated. Over 50% of the seating was empty but there were about 20 of was waiting to get seated. It would not have been a problem if the staff had a sense of urgency, but they were slow to seat people. We waited at least 10 minutes before we decided to leave and there were still people ahead if us waiting to get a table. We did not all come at the same time either, the customers were staggered on arrival time. The staff just didn't want to seat people when they walked in, they just took names. We asked if the problem was if they were short staffed and she never really answered, however, it did not appear that they were. They just didn't want to sit tables at the same time. We would have been happy sitting at a table with a drink and menu while we waited on a server. The food is not that good (edpecially for the price) at PF Chang's to begin with, so, we left. Won't be back...ever."}
{"text":"Beautiful deco ! Excellent service!!!!  Thanks to our waiter Austin!! OMG! Calamari veggie appetizer, Singapore spicy chicken and Sichuan beef are to die for!!"}
{"text":"We had a late dinner here after my fiancé's father flew in. They were already waiting for us when we arrived. They ordered the lettuce wraps for an appetizer and they were pretty good! And for dinner we ordered the Chang's chicken, beef & broccoli, and the shrimp lo mein. The chang chicken was actually really yummy! It had a sweet but spicy sauce on it. The broccoli was cut into huge pieces and it wasn't completely cooked so it was hard - and I couldn't cut it into smaller pieces because it was so hard... lastly the lo mein, it wasn't special. I could order from the Chinese restaurant from down the street and get better lo mein. The server was alright, checked on us a couple of times. This was my second time coming to a PF Changs, and I can definitely tell you this won't be my first choice but if my friend or family wanted to meet here, I would come."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places.  I have never had subpar food.  One of the few places that has been consistently excellent for many years.  I always feel good eating there fresh foods.  However, ditch the sushi !  lol
The banana eggrolls are the best.  And their very own tropical ice cream is delicious!!"}
{"text":"I really have to give it up for P.F. Chang's.  Their service was just phenomenal!

We dined at P.F. Chang's twice while in Las Vegas - during our first visit, we explained that my wife has a gluten sensitivity and the staff went overboard to ensure she was well taken care of, from recommending their favorite gluten free items to ensuring she had gluten free soy sauce.

On our second visit, we were pulling a large wagon full of equipment (my wife and I are photographers and were working that day in the casino) and they ensured that we were sat at a table where our wagon would be safe from accidental kicks and that other patrons would not trip over it.  Once more, our waiter made excellent recommendations and we received wonderful service.

It was actually one of the best restaurant experiences we have ever had.  I'd like to add that it's little things like this that make or break a trip.  We happened to be in Las Vegas for business that day, but the staff made us feel as though we were on vacation."}
{"text":"The service was slow and the food was extremely salty. When I told the waiter how salty the food was i was told \"yeah the soy sauce makes it salty\". Like it was intentional. Worse PF Changs experience."}
{"text":"Just a little disappointed with this restaurant... The last time we came here was about 2 yrs ago, we ordered take out and the server decided to add a tip on our bill without our knowledge then we caught it later.  So we eventually received a gift card and we didn't use it until tonight.  We must have had the slowest waiter who made us wait super long for our bill and then gave us big bills for change.  So sneaky, then I had to wait up front to try and get change then low and behold it was the same darn waiter up front who ended up giving me the change.  So disappointed because we tried to give them another chance with no prevail!!!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai needs more work flavor is way off noodles over cooked. Needs more spice and peanut oil flavor. Fried Calamari and Vegetable was great would like to see more vegetables in the dish. Hostess was great wonderful service she was very busy and yet very attentive. Nice team work among all staff members noticed how they all work together as a team. Great work."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight before going to Wicked, and I have to say it was probably one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. 

There were five of us; 4 adults and one kid with food allergies. 

Usually, when going to a restaurant no one, including the servers, seem to have any idea what on the menu would be good for someone with food allergies. They hem and haw and guess at things. This doesn't work so well for someone with severe allergies. We explained our issue to our server, Lauren, who said she would get the manager who would print out a special menu for us. That's right, a special menu. So over comes the manager, Jeff Jensen. We tell him that our kid has peanut and egg allergies, and he leaves and comes back with a specially printed out menu that has basically a list of everything on their menu that is safe for someone with those specific allergies. I have NEVER had a restaurant do that before. Absolutely amazing customer service. Both our server and the manager came back a couple times to make sure everything worked out ok with the special menu, not just to make sure the rest of the food was good. Major kudos to both Lauren and Jeff!

Now about the food: The oolong marinated Chilean Sea Bass is one of my favourite dishes there. The sauce is fantastic, the fish is tender and flavourful, and the fresh, wilted spinach is the perfect veggie for it. Salt and pepper prawns are great too. Appetisers: get the calamari, fried green beans or crab wontons and you won't be disappointed. For dessert, the tres leches lemon dream (either the mini or full size) is just the right balance of sweet and tart.

Our service was outstanding and fast, even with the restaurant being packed right before the show. Our food was great. All in all it was simply a great night!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. I can't comment on the service as I ordered takeout, but the food left a lot to be desired. I ordered the crispy honey chicken for myself and Mongolian beef for my husband with a side of long life noodles to share. The noodles were stuck together in a clump and the chicken was soggy. My husband's beef was extremely dry and chewy. I'll give them two stars because it was edible, but it sucked. We both agreed that we won't be back."}
{"text":"Located in the Planet Hollywood Casino, this incarnation of the chain does the job quite well.  This is by far the largest version I've seen.  It's two floors.  We were on the first and it was huge.

There was no wait when we arrived and a small wait when we left.  Service was quick and friendly.  We ordered the dinner special for 2 which is the best deal in this place (1 double appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 soups and a small dessert)

The food was consistently good as I have had at other PF Changs."}
{"text":"Once again PF Changs is great, sat out on the patio the weather was prefect outside and our server was great! It was great as always."}
{"text":"This changs is more quite then the one on the strip if you want fun and excitment then go to the one one the strip, the service was good here and it is prolly the best chain resturant in the world!"}
{"text":"Ok call out order, they stay open later then the other pf Changs, The take out or was great! and we got free Lettuce wraps!!! Yum this is by far my favorite resturant chain or no chain! Great time in Vegas thanks to Changs!"}
{"text":"I went out lunch and was very impressed the service provided was top notch and the food was awesome I ordered the Pad Thai and the lettuce wraps and hot sour soup as an appetizer everything that came out was fresh and on point I think I just found another favorite spot....."}
{"text":"This is the SLOWEST PF Changs we have ever been to!! We have been to over 15+ different ones across the country.  The only reason I gave them a 2 is because the service from the bartender. The food was the worst from any Changs and the excuse we got is they only have 1 cook. The manager acted like he could care less it took us 40 mins to get out lunch after they made it wrong and had to redo. Guess it's cause he is so young he Doesn't get customer service!'"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money coming here. The service was horrible. It all started with the manager asking if our waiter has been by already and they had not. Our waitress forgot about us completely and when we mentioned something she came back with an excuse. We waited forever for her to come around so I could ask for chili paste. We ordered a roll and they came back 10 minutes later with the soy sauce plates after we had already eaten half the roll and asked someone else for the plates. The soy sauce dispenser looked like it hadn't beem cleaned in years. It was gross and sticky. I hadn't been to P.F. Changs in a couple of years but I remember the food being so much better. The spicy chicken wasn't even spicy, Mongolian beef looked and tasted like it was reheated. The egg drop soup wasn't good at all. The fried rice from Pei Wei is so much better in my opinion and yes food wasnt as warm as you would expect it to be. It was just a disappointment all the way around. We won't be back. Kind of wish I could go back in time and just go to our little neighborhood place which is way better. Zero stars deserved. Over priced, shitty service and food wasn't good."}
{"text":"Asian fusion food.  Very busy, usually a wait for dinner.  The food is above average, but the decor is very cramped.  With the usual crowd, this is not a place for a sedate dinner, but its central location makes it a nice place to eat before doing something else in the area."}
{"text":"So while P.F. Chang's will never really be known for VEGAN delights they do have some items available for VEGANS believe it or not. We had the Tofu Lettuce wraps....Buddha's Feast.....and Ma Po Tofu......both dishes had some great Tofu and awesome veggies. Now the Tofu was a little soft and that is why I didn't give this a five star review but as I said the broccoli and all the veggies my wife had with her meal were very fresh. You also have a choice of brown or white stemmed rice and both were good as well.

Now I learned during this visit from our waiter that the chef will substitute a few of the rice and noodle items on the menu that come with chicken, shrimp, pork and even beef (depending on the dish) with Tofu.....not many but some.....so that was very good to know for future visits. So it goes without saying the customer service was good.....the location was good with free parking......and the establishment has a very nice ambiance considering it is right off the strip. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love PF and although every restaurant on the strip is constantly crowded and noisy, this restaurant when I visited it was not half bad with the noise. PF has amazing soup and their Mongolian beef is incredibly delicious/mouthwatering! Downtown on the strip check this place out!"}
{"text":"Decent Asian fusion food.  The open air configuration of the restaurant can tend to make the place noisy, so not the spot for a romantic interlude.  The service was above average."}
{"text":"Our first time at this location. Stopped in on NYE before heading to the Laugh Factory. The food was excellent as always and the wine was even better. 

Ambience is great here and not too loud. I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"On a Sunday night we ended up here just to grab a quick bite.  Think again.....it was packed!  Over an hour wait!  My fiance and I waited at the bar and luckily a bar table opened up within a few minutes.  We ordered dinner here instead to avoid the other wait.  The kitchen must have been backed up, because it was a long wait once we ordered our food.  Th meal was very blah.  Flavorless food and very greasy.  I was less than impressed about the whole experience."}
{"text":"Just ok. Maybe it's our choices of food. Just not what I remembered it use to be. The sad part is I could make the same things at home from a frozen box and it would taste the same. Sending out sushi with brown and rotten spots on the avocado is not my idea of great quality. I had to send it back. Service was great."}
{"text":"It's another chain experience - and is full of salt.  It's food and just nothing special."}
{"text":"I frequently get take out from P.F. Changs. I get the fried rice with double shrimp and it is always delicious. Its most certainly enough to feed two people for around $10. I always use the curbside service and I've never had a problem. I call ahead and its ready in 15-20 minutes. I have dined inside this P.F. Changs on a few occasions and something always goes wrong. I'm definitely a fan of their take out but will probably never dine in again."}
{"text":"Great gluten free food. I eat at PF Changs a lot. Why, because i know i will get a great meal that is gluten free. The staff was very nice. Everything came out quick. Glad we came."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service here is horrible. Took forever and they just talk to each other instead of taking care of customers. I am a major fan of PF Changs, but this one was bad."}
{"text":"First time at P.F. Chang's. The atmosphere was nice and the service was really good. Food was not. So we ordered spring rolls, sweet and sour, egg drop soup and the crab wontons.. we were not flattered. Kung Pao chicken wasn't any great either. My expectations were way higher than what we got. The food was not worth the ticket."}
{"text":"What a difference a few years, from being a top restaraunt to indifference.
The host was pleasant and had us seated quickly, there is where the experience changed, service was desperatly slow even though there was only a few tables, side work and staff talking loudly behind us was much more important.
The mongolian beefwas overly salty, over cooked and almost inedable, the honey shrimp was soggy and tastless.
Sad to see a great chain drop to this.
Last time here"}
{"text":"Good honey shrimp & lettuce wraps. Liked our server, L.  Other guests thought egg drop soup was great; I thought it was just ok. Dynamite shrimp were Amazing! Did not care for my \"Fifty Fifty\" drink; way too sweet, but that is personal preference.  Overall, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Ahh, the ubiquitous PF Chang's...

The food is good - as American Chinese goes. But don't confuse it with real Chinese food. The ambience is a step above a traditional Chinese place. And the service is very good.

The wok seared lamb is excellent, if a little salty."}
{"text":"So I have not been to a PF Chang's in sometime, now I remember why.  I brought my Fiance as she has never been to one of these.

Ambiance-  really nice restaurant, nice decor and good lighting.  We were able to get a seat right away.  However, it was like am arctic freezer in there.  Takes a lot for me to be cold and that place was crazy cold!  So cold it was flat out uncomfortable.

Service-  our waiter was great.  Super friendly and  even made some reccomendations.  He did a great job.  The food did take forever to come out though.  We ordered 2 apps and they came out over 10mins apart.

Food- bland on bland.  The Crab Wontons did not taste very good.  The filling was just not great, but that could just be me not liking them.  The Dynamite Shrimp was not very Dynamite.  Not very spicy at all and waaay to much batter.  There was a tiny little shrimp surrounded by batter.  My Beef and Broccoli was on point however.  My Fiance had Pad Thai.  Said it was ok, had way too much Tofu.  

Paid $60 with tip, price was fair.

Overall not impressed and don't plan on coming back.  Unfortunate to since it's so close to home."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's is definitely a good place as an Asian-themed restaurant provides safe and delicious food and free drink refill with extremely nice service. It definitely a good restaurant to enjoy and relax. The Dan dan noodles is too salty and not enough spicy I think."}
{"text":"I like P.F. Chang's. I really do, however, there were a couple things that turned me off to this experience at Planet Hollywood. First off, I asked them to go light on the pepper flakes on my Kung Pao, since I am a baby when it comes to heat. And of course, it was loaded with pepper flakes. However, it didn't really  matter in the long run because our waitress's breath smelled like a dumpster and she kept breathing on me. Pop a mint, honey! I totally lost my appetite because her ass mouth and avoided conversation with her like the plague. Also, she was slower than cold tar, it took forever to get each course."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Server was very patient w my kids. The kids love the orange chicken and rice."}
{"text":"right now i am all about the happy hour menu which runs from 3pm - 6pm. the happy hour list has a generous selection of their more popular dishes for a more affordable price of $3 - $6. the portions are pretty decent and you can fill up on about 4 or 5 dishes between 2 people. 

whenever i go the service is always on point, i love the atmosphere, although it can get loud at times, and the food is always so tasty. 

thank you pf happy hour!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner lastnight and the bartender and manager were both awesome. Food came out perfect too. Great food great drinks and fun conversation with both of them. They totally redeemed themselves from prev visit. Thank you pf changs."}
{"text":"I love me some PF Changs.  And I have to say I especially like the Waterfront location as well.  I have not had a bad experience here, the staff is always friendly and attentive (whether you are at the bar or seated at a table), the food is always good and is very consistent.  Whether we are doing curbside to go, or eating in, this is a great spot!

I always seem to order the same thing... Moo Goo Gai Pan.  I wish they still had the Lemon Scallop dish that they once did though (that also was to die for)!"}
{"text":"Stephanie is an awesome bartender and pays attention to the high tops fabulously!  Despite lackluster service there before, this definitely has made up for it!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here around 4:30 pm. We were seated right away and the waiter started the drinks immediately! My wife ordered the honey chicken with brown rice and I had the Korean bbq chicken stir fry. The meals came out in a very timely manner. The food was hot and prepared to both of our likings. The Korean bbq was a first for me. I would definitely order it again. The only real complaint I have is the cleanliness of the table we were seated at. The soy sauce bottle was stuck to the table. I tried with some force to free the bottle with no success. We both laughed about it and I gave it a quick karate chop to free it from the table. There was quite a ring of stickiness left on the table once the bottle had been displaced.  Overall very pleased with the meal and the service! I'm not sure if this is a sign or not but my fortune cookie was missing the fortune. I think my wife was afraid to ride home with me!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of PF Changs, and each time I go they only secure their place in my heart. Recently I've been trying to go Gluten and Dairy free to see if it helps some health issues. I really appreciate a restaurant that has a dedicated Gluten Free menu. It makes things so much easier. I hate feeling like I'm being high maintenance for needing special requests. 

Tonight's meal was perfect. I started with a cup of GF Egg Drop soup $3.50, for my entrée I ordered GF Changs Spicy Chicken $14.95 and GF Half Spinach with Garlic $3.95. Everything was so good. The Gluten free food is only about $1 or so more than the regular food and it was seriously so good. Plus I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Double yay!

Make sure you ask for GF soy sauce. They need to bring it from the back. The stuff on the table is not gluten free. 

We sat at the bar and the staff was great, especially Philip (I think that was his name - on the receipt) Our drinks were always full. At first, my friend ordered the regular entrée Orange Beef. After the first bite, she didn't like it and they took it back and got her the Honey Chicken without any issue. She liked the Honey Chicken much better. She also ordered the pan fried dumplings. She gets this every time and they are her favorite. I tried to talk her into ordering off the gluten free menu... but she said she wanted extra gluten on her food. She's funny.

Thanks to PF Changs for an excellent dining experience. We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Haley made me a new custom drink todaythat i am calling the Batman... and this will be the only place in Nevada and only Haley - who is FANTASTIC!!!! And makes this place doubly fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"We had a gift card to use and it was well worth it. 

Drinks: 2 beers
App: Lettuce wraps
Soup: Hot and sour
Mains: PFC Spicy chicken and Sesame chicken, 1/2 white 1/2 brown Rice
Desert: Mini cheesecake and mini chocolate cake

$50.85, not bad. 

The service was great and the server Clint was great."}
{"text":"We went to the P.F. Chang's located on Superstition Springs Blvd in Mesa, AZ.  Our server's name was Michael; he is one of the best servers we've had compared to other servers at other named restaurants.  He was professional, friendly, had a nice smile, very attentive & knowledgeable.  He made sure we had everything we needed & checked on us frequently.  If P.F. Chang's mangement reads this, please thank Michal for his great customer service!  We hope we get him as our server the next time we visit P.F. Chang's!  Also, the food was wonderful!!  There's a new item on the menu \"Jicama Taco's\" - really really tasteful!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place that all of us can agree on. This place ended up being it. Boy were we pleasantly happy with it. Friendly staff. Greeted us right away. Table put together in 3 minutes. We sat down and a minute later we were ordering drinks. 5 minutes later all the drinks showed up and the order was spot on. Took a bit to decide what to get. Finally we did and our waiter was so helpful in figuring out what some us really wanted. So much food was ordered. All came out hot and in a very reasonable time. Tasted great. Slightly over priced but I think ok for the area one could argue. Well seasoned and full of flavor. Even enough to take some home with us. Best part was the coconut ice cream and banana egg rolls. Delicious. Definitely a place to come back to next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Everything was SALTY!!! hot and sour soup, beef and broccoli..and worst dish of all was the pan fried noodles w/ beef. YUCK!"}
{"text":"Wedding rehearsal dinner..... Service was pretty good to start, dining area for a group was very nice.....you can fit 10+ easy....we are gonna eat here in a minute so j will update later.....

Haven't eaten a of Chang's in a while so I will be interested in seeing how it goes...."}
{"text":"Love this place! Lettuce wraps amazing! Egg rolls so good! Love the passion tea! Good service good food good times. This location is not as busy as some of the others so it's a great place on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Lo mein was amazing.  The lobster tacos were really good. Great service."}
{"text":"Typical pj changes but huge. We waited forever in line. It was almost ridiculous. I had to go for a work adventure but everyone liked the food and the service was great. The servers are trained well here. 

We shared just about everything so I would have to say the food was really good"}
{"text":"Even though P.F. Chang's is a chain, it remains one of my favorite places to eat.  The atmosphere inside makes for a great dinner or place to get drinks.  I have always had great service at this location as well.

For starters you have to get the lettuce wraps.  The hot seasoned chicken, with a cool fresh piece of lettuce is a perfect contrast and tastes great.  They also have really good egg rolls.  

For my entree my favorites are the spicy chicken, honey chicken, and kung pao chicken.  The chicken is perfectly breaded and the sauces are very unique  and each taste amazing.  I have also had the sushi here.  I was skeptical at first, but was pleasantly surprised.  They are always very fresh and have great flavor.  My favorite is the lobster avocado roll."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas last weekend and ate at P.F. Changs, on Paradise Rd., and here's my review.  First of all I really like this restaurant because of the ambiance and food.  I ate at the bar this time and got the best service I could have imagined.  Bret was the bartender and took GREAT care of me.  Always asked if I needed anything.  Made sure that the food was cooked to my liking and didn't make me wait.  Bret is very professional and courteous.  He should be working at an upscale restaurant.  He's that good.  Ask for him when you visit if you eat at the bar."}
{"text":"The service is okay. 

The food, is great and sometimes not so great. I guess it depends who's the cook in the back. 
Best thing you should get is their chicken wrap, Mongolian beef, and calamari. Other than that, the shrimp w/ lobster sauce was such a disappointment. I thought it was going to be different and something really good. But let me tell you, it's just boiled shrimp with egg flour soup. Literally..."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here, food was great server was very nice and attentive. Chicken egg rolls were not my favorite but other wise everything was great."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews for restaurants, but I was really disatisfied with my experience at PF Chang's yesterday. I was especially pissed off by the bad service attitude of the waitress Stacy. First she messed up my order, and then tried to blame me for it. When the order was remade, it was awefully salty. After I got the bill, I told her that it was inedibly salty (I didn't eat 95% of the dish). I was just expressing my view and not looking to get it canceled on my bill or anything, but she just ignored me and picked up the dish and left. How about at least comforting the customer by saying \"sorry, next time we will make it better\". She just ignored me as if I am non-existent. Who the hell wants to eat at a restaurant where the waitress treats the customers like crap.

I have been to PF Chang's in different locations a good number of times and have always been satisfied with the food and service, except this time. I guess it's the waitress Stacy that ruined my experience at this PF Chang's at Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"I've eaten at PF Chang's a few times and it is always a C-.  I really didn't like any of the dishes I had this time and I think I have to remind myself that even when desperate and starving, I should find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"This PF Chang's location is conveniently located for the people that live in North Phoenix Metro.  I'm not a big fan of PF Chang's for I think the drown their food in way too much sauce and I don't care for their rice because it's almost always too dry and clumpy.  

I do think PF Chang's is A~OK only because they offer a good variety of gluten free options, great tasting apps and my family likes coming here.  We are also somewhat limited with a few good places to eat in the far north metro area. 

Food:  My last visit I had the hot & sour soup ~ it was OK but would be better with some chicken or beef.  Apps were fried calamari ~ very good with a little extra salt/pepper and a squeeze of lemon.  Main dish was kung pao chicken ~ again way too much sauce, chicken was very good but the veggies were not cut even. As a result some were over cooked and some under cooked.  I was going to say something to our server, but with all that sauce it all tasted the same.  I asked for a substitute of noodles in place of my rice, but that was an up-charge... 

We wanted our little desert shooter to go which they don't make it to go.  Our server brought us a container to scrape our desert into.  Realy? It's a shooter desert and they give you this tiny spoon to use.  

Go for the apps, have a cocktail and call it a night at PF Chang's."}
{"text":"Went to PF Changs on a Sunday night before memorial day. It was pretty busy, but we had a reservation and were seated promptly. Our waitiress introduced herself, and brought us our waters. The plan was to split 2 apps and 1 main course. We got the Seared Ahi Tuna and the Northern Style Ribs, The tuna was very good, I'm a sucker for tuna apps. The ribs were delicious as well, they fell right off of the bone. There was a bit of fatty tissue on them, though. We then split the Orange Peel Beef, which I thought was okay, but I probably wouldn't get it again. Just didn't like how it tastes, although I know plenty of people like it.

Service was below average, our waitress didn't smile or talk at all until the very end, when we gave her our Warrior Card number. Tip: sign up for Warrior Rewards and you'll get free lettuce wraps just for signing up, which are delicious. The floor of the restaurant was also a little dirty, which I didn't like.

Overall, a good experience at PF Chang's. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Last night I was really craving some Chinese food and wanted something a bit more upscale than the usual places we go (Ginbu and Taipei Express, to name a few), so we headed to PF Chang's. Normally I try to stay away from chains like this and go to local places, but Charlotte isn't known for its stellar ethnic food and I knew I'd like the food at PF Chang's.

The Mongolian beef seems to be popular among other reviewers and I have to agree. It's pretty delicious. My boyfriend had the shrimp fried rice, which was also good. Our server was really pleasant and helpful. All in all, it was a good dining experience. And I had enough left over to eat Mongolian beef for lunch today."}
{"text":"As usual perfect Chinese food. Prices have gone up since our last visit but hey.. You are on the strip man. Enjoy! We had garlic prawns, veggie dish for the wife and fried rice."}
{"text":"Husband and I went there for lunch. Quick service and food was super delicious. Their prices are good and I love PF Changs chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time ever at a P.F. Chang's. Went for lunch with my husband. While service was prompt and friendly, food was just not good. Tried the Korean BBQ Chicken Stir-fry topped with \"kimchi slaw\". Portion was smallish. Chicken was tender but not very flavorful, and I don't know what that slaw was, but it had zero kimchi in it. I have no idea how they can even use the word \"kimchi\" to describe it. Also, there was a clump of rock-hard, dried rice on my plate...not acceptable in any Asian restaurant. Hubby said his food was just okay. IMO, just a generally disappointing experience. For the price point you can find better Asian food at other places. Do not plan on returning. 2 stars."}
{"text":"I've most def had a better experience at other P.F. Chang's locations in CA. The service was bad, the waiter would forget about us. And the food was so hard to swallow mainly because it was so salty. It was a different taste than the ones here in LA, and I always order the same thing. The alcoholic drinks came fast, though. That's what earned them this extra star."}
{"text":"Service no good, food bland. Go somewhere else. Not a good example of Chinese cuisine. Save your money, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This pf changs is a nice one. Staff is super friendly and fast. Food doesn't taste too great. We got mongolian beef and crispy honey shrimp... It was salty. Wait time wasnt real bad,btw its a Friday night! We got in within 20 mins. Parking isnt bad but a little cramped."}
{"text":"This place is disappointing.... First, Panda Express is even better than the dishes this place has...  Some of the dishes looks different than the picture shows on their own website... Second when I tried to order things online, their system doesn't work on the submission page... Totally waste of your time to select the dishes and Input your name and email etc..  Third, I think this place discriminates Asians too.  When I try to get my seating, the host smiled and introduced the different options for the couple in front of me.  And when it is my turn, the host was not patient and didn't talk to me about any of the seating options.  when I try to ask her, she is really impatient.  When I grabbed  my seat, the server never checked me once after I ordered but she constantly check the other tables.  When I asked my check, I have to call her out and grab her attention.  Because the food sucks so bad, I only tried a little of the food I ordered and ready to leave.  The server asked me do I want to box the food and when I told her no, she didn't even bother to ask if I like the food I ordered or if there is something wring with them.  She just passed me the check and that is it.  Overall, horrible experience and will never return for sure....  Sadly they serving  asian cuisine but trade Asians really bad."}
{"text":"This location is not far from the Las Vegas strip, it seems more casual the many of the other P.F. Change locations that I have patronized. We ordered the lettuce wraps and instead of the table side preparation we were just given a single dipping container. The food was brought to us nice and hot and our servers were friendly. It's nice having a  familiar option for dining when visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"What should have been a simple pick-up order turned into almost a 1/2 hour wait for the manager to sign off on our voucher; and this was on a Monday night after peak dinner time. Hopefully their food is worth it. At least the bartender was nice and on top of things."}
{"text":"First time at P.F. Changs. Ordered the Salt & Pepper Calamari and was not impressed. A little soggy. For the main I had the Lamb and it was a little better than ok. I always wanted to go to P.F Changs so I guess I was pumped for an excellent meal. Not the case."}
{"text":"So delicious very time I visit. This was extra special. A home office employee of the restaurant paid for our dinner bill. Such nice people. :)  I'll pay it for AED and come again to eat. :)"}
{"text":"Christmas came and went and I made bank this year and got $225 in gift cards. For some reason though my family thinks I live at P.F. Chang's cause that is where all the gift cards were for.  I mean I am no going to complain about free food money. So of course I could not resist, so me and my wife went a couple of days after Christmas for lunch.
     First off we have been here before a good number of times. We are far from regulars, but we enjoy ourselves once in a while. Granted it is not super fancy expensive, it still a bit much to go every week on my salary. Getting that gift card is a nice little treat to start the year off.
     We arrived a P.F. Chang's around 2pm on Wednesday, Dec. 28. I would call that a nice lunch time hour and we must have shown up right after the rush, because the parking lot was pretty full, place was packed, and NO WAIT!!! Now there is something very important that you must do when you are greeted by the Host/Hostess; ask if Ja'twann is working. Ja'twann is by far one of the best servers I have ever had. He has been working there for a few years now, since I first went to P.F. Chang's. He is a nationally certified trainer, and an awesome guy. Also for all my fellow comic/video game/movie lovers out there he is the server for you. So if you want some awesome service, a charismatic server, a P.F. Chang super star, and overall nice guy, you need to have Ja'twann be your server. 
     Now since we had all this moolah, we decided on our first free trip we would splurge. Why not??? We started out with 2 appetizers. I am sucker for steamed pork dumplings and my wife loves their fired green beans. Now they always bring out a little dish of sauces which are delicious and spicy. The server, Ja'twann in our case, usually will offer to make you a tasty mixed sauce if you are interested. The apps arrived in a timely manner and were quickly devoured. The dumplings are superb. They are plump nice sized dumplings that are nice little preparation for what is to come. The wife loves the green beans, the batter they use is really good. Appetizers were definitely on a Jet li: Bruce Lee ratio of awesomeness
     For our actual lunch we ate very well. I ordered the ChengDu spiced lamb and my wife ordered the Vegetable double pan-fried noodles. After chatting and killing time with Ja'twann, since no once else really came in after us, our food came.  And boy was is good. The lamb was banging, just awesome. It had just the perfect amount of spice to get that little burn, but had a very nice cool minty undertone to keep it from being scorching. I was totally impressed. I got a good portion of rice. I am never really happy when I get a ton of rice and a little meat. So the portion size for me was perfect. I could not find anything negative on this dish at all. Wifey enjoyed her noodles. Direct quote \"Loved them!!!\" took our time eating and enjoyed every last bite, well the Mrs. took the rest of hers home. Overall I would put main entree, using the same awesomeness scale, at a Donnie Yen:Bruce Lee.
     Since we wee living it up I had to order the most amazing desert they have, in my opinion. I am proud member of CU, Chocolaholics Unanonymous, so I ordered a slice of  The Great Wall of Chocolate. This thing is a whopping 6 layers of decadent deliciousness. AND it has mini choco chips on the outside icing!!!! So moist and soft and every other amazing thing you think it should be.Needless to say I ate that thing whole and thought my stomach was going to burst. This little morsel receives a shirtless Bruce Lee after smashing a guy in the face with a 5 second WAHHH!!!!! 
       Overall I think P.F. Chang's is a great restaurant. It has a great variety of foods,  with nice options for vegetarians and some choices for those who go gluten free.  Looking for a nice place to go on a date with your special someone, or nice family gathering? Definitely a place to consider. I mean Beyonce's sister ate here with a Carolina Panther, if I remember correctly, so it must be half way distant hehe. Besides, you will always have a good experience, as long as you know who to ask for. 

P.S The few times I have been here I have had some wanna-be good service, this crazy bitch who was very rude, but overall friendly staff."}
{"text":"We decided to go to PF Chang's last night instead of Cheesecake Factory...what a mistake that was.  I used to LOVE PF Chang's...I don't know what has happened to the food, but the portions are half the size, not as good as they used to be, it's WAAAAY overpriced, and the service sucks!!  Our waiter was pretty rude.  I haven't been since May of 2015, our service sucked then too.  I'll NEVER go there again.  I had lettuce wraps and lo mein, my boyfriend had some kind of dumplings and some sort of beef something.  Then he wanted apple cobbler...no drinks, that was it...the bill was $56.00.  I think that's outrageous...and his plate of food looked like it would feed a 16 year old.  Both of us are not overweight, and we don't over eat, but I like to save any leftovers for lunch the following day...I had some because I wasn't that hungry, but he ate all of his and was still hungry.  I was very disappointed.  I'll never go there again, and I'll tell all of my friends the same thing.  From now on, we'll go to Cheesecake Factory...at least their portion size reflects the price.  I honestly think Pei Wei is better than Chang's and it's half the price."}
{"text":"Do I like PF Changs? Ya, it is okay. Do I love it, not really. I like authentic, the type of place that makes me want to go back again and again. That place for me is Wong's in Avondale. They have my heart and tummy. Today though was a family birthday and this is where they wanted to go so who am I to judge. Anyhow, as mentioned the food was okay but nothing blew my mind. I won't mention anything in particular as we had about 10 dishes and they all just carried a nice three star feel. I will provide pictures though. The one thing that does deserve mentioning was our waitress. She was awesome. She handled our party of eleven with ease and no joke, our drinks never ran out. Very impressed. Service here has always been good for that matter.  PF Changs is a solid three star establishment."}
{"text":"ehhh so mediocre. so not Chinese food. Did not like all 4 of the items I ordered."}
{"text":"We enjoy dining at PFChangs Northlake, but the service and attention is spotty. Last night we had reservations and were seated in a nice area after just a short wait. The server was vivacious, but so busy she was distracted. She took our order and that's the last we saw of her until after dinner. The apps came out one at a time (ours and then my son's 10-15 min later). Then their entrees came, but mine was a good 10 min later...all delivered by different people. When a salmon dish arrived, we asked if it was the Norwegian salmon my husband ordered or  the steamed salmon I ordered. He had no idea and literally put it on the table and walked away. A manager stopped by and we were going to say something constructive, but she gabbed on about my husbands golf hat it was hard to get a word in. It seems they are all in such a rush they can't focus on making sure the details of serving a table run smoothly. It may be a while, but we hope to have a better experience next time."}
{"text":"I had a gift card for $50 here and was excited to eat here again. 
I always ordered the Ma Po tofu and would ask for it extra crispy. 
My waitress Juanita ( spelling?) took my order and when I received it from someone else my tofu was gross, it was charcoal burnt and inedible with the sauce on the side! 
I told Juanita about it and she was not happy they put the sauce on the side because she didn't order it that way. 
So I said I'd take pepper steak instead which my boyfriend ordered and it was delicious! 
The four stars is mainly because of our waitress she was awesome, she didn't make me feel bad for returning the tofu. 
The food was still great just don't order the tofu extra crispy and you'll be fine. 
I'd recommend for a date for sure"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went in @ 8:00 with a group of 7 people. Multiple groups that came after us get to go in before us. Waited until 9:20 to go in and when we walked in there were many tables open... Made my group very unhappy & we didn't get to enjoy our time there. /:"}

    We had the Tempura shrimp roll sushi. It was fresh and delicious.
One of our favorites, the walnut, and shrimp with melons entree was done to perfection.
Our server was Janice, she did a great job."}
{"text":"Great service, very attentive waitress who was able to recommend such a delicious dish. I ended up getting the Crispy Honey Chicken which was amazing! The portions were pretty big and I was able to make 2 meals out of it. We also got Mongolian Beef which was also sooo good! Didn't get a chance to check out dessert this time. Hopefully next visit we will!"}
{"text":"Always great food, drinks, and service! Chic and relaxing atmosphere and always clean. The kitchen was behind on our last visit and our food took longer than usual, but the manager paid for it and apologized."}
{"text":"We should have listened to these reviews. 

Dirty silverware, something was going wrong in the restaurant....we had to listen to a random dinging/alarm for 20 minutes. 

We had the 4 course Meal for Two:

1) Soup, meh. 

2) Egg rolls, really meh taste and literally dripping in oil. 

3) Sesame chicken had no flavor with a weird after taste

Spicy chicken was not spicy and had little flavor. 

Also, we ordered white rice and they bring out our rice and it's brown with the explanation \"sorry we are out of white rice! Hahah!\" The guy bringing the food literally laughed. They didn't even offer quinoa instead. What? It's a Tuesday night....

4) Dessert: Banana egg roll with ice cream. Banana egg roll only had flavor due to the caramel topping. And the ice cream was the only good part. Oh and they gave us forks...to eat ice cream...

We live in a rural town in northern Wisconsin and the Chinese there had more flavor, spice, and less oil!

We will NOT eat here again."}
{"text":"This PF Chang's was way better than the one in Palo Alto, CA. 

The service was good and fast. We came as a group of three at lunch time. I really like the lunch menu. You can get what you like in a smaller portion that is more than enough. Comes with a soup also. 

The place is very big, like all PF Chang's and very clean."}
{"text":"Our first PF Chang's visit since our less than stellar one almost a year ago in Baton Rouge. Our server was terrific and the food was back to its usual yumminess! The wonton soup seemed to lack just a touch of salt but everything else was spot on - from the northern ribs to the crispy shrimp, beef cubes, and of course combo noodles and the best fried rice there is.

We enjoyed a bit of a discount thanks to gift cards purchased at Costco. That helps to ease the sting of the trendiness-driven premium prices. Well done PF Chang's. Glad to be back!"}
{"text":"What happened to my PF Chang?? I had lunch yesterday with a friend.  Lettuce Wrap:  the bed of noodles were not crispy, the chicken was cold and the lettuce leave were at room temperature, instead of being cold and crispy.  Our lomein was cold.  Nevertheless, our mixed fried rice was delicious.  Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer.  They are delicious.  I could make a meal out of the chicken lettuce wraps alone.  

For my main meal, I chose the Kung Pow Chicken.  It has just the right amount of spicy heat.  The Kung Pow was very fantastic.  It is my favorite meal at P.F. Chang's.  It is so good, that I will be taking some home for lunch tomorrow.  

For desert, I recommend the New York Cheesecake.  It is so smooth and seems to almost melt in your mouth.  

My server, Aaron, two thumbs up and a well deserved 20% gratuity for his effort!"}
{"text":"Once is a coincidence twice is not. I'm not sure what's worse, the staff or their manager Ken. Twice now they have butchered our orders and tonight was extra special. I placed an order through DoorDash and ask for a call if there is a problem. I get a call \"we can't make it without the sauce, do you still want it?\" Me \"yes that's fine\". The staff then tells me they canceled it and I have to add that plate back on I let them know I can't and after 15 minutes of on and off holds I'm told to call DoorDash. Really? I asked to talk to the manager because to me there's just a matter of common sense here, either you apologize and include it because you had no reason to cancel the order in the first place or you take a card over the phone ... 6 minutes later Ken the manager gets on the phone who hardly lets me get a word in and finishes with \"okay okay just come pick it up no problem\". Ken, I don't think you know how DoorDash works or how customer service works."}
{"text":"I always love all of P.F. Change gluten free options! My favorite gluten free options are the Spicy Chicken (similar dish at Pei Wei) and the Mongolian Beef. I especially like that the gluten free meals come on separate plates than the regular meals - so you always know that you're good to go and it's gluten free!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner time, it was really busy but we were seated right away. Our server was very friendly and attentive. I ordered the cauliflower tempera for the appetizer, and the jicama street tacos but sadly they were all out! (Really wanted to try it but o well next time!) So I ordered the vegetation lettuce wrap instead, the cauliflower kinda tasted like chicken to me, I think it's because of the sauce but it was good either way! We basically waited for an 40 mins for our food but that's understandable since it was PACKED, the manager did come and check on us and everyone else which was really nice(: My lettuce wraps were good, I tried some shrimp Pad Thai also, the flavors were all there but the noodles weren't soft enough for my taste. Overall good food + friendly service = will be back (:"}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars for the food. Otherwise the service was absolutely terrible and so is the management.

-Forgot drinks
-Waited 20 minutes at a time, for anything.
-The restaurant was empty, yet our food came out at different times or not at all.
-Called the manager after our service to inform her of our dinning experience. WAS NOT looking for anything free and said so. She did not listen to a word I had to say and defended our terrible service. Then spoke over me to tell me she will give me a free dinner. FYI the customer is always right. 

That will be our last birthday dinner at PF Changs. All of us are in the industry and know what good service looks like. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Food is always good... gluten free menu was fantastic addition.  Now have beers on tap, expanded the bar area with a couple huge tables ideal for those of us who like to meet new people in the neighborhood, and a fabulous new happy hour menu.  Service is outstanding at this location -bartenders are great!"}
{"text":"The food quality at this location did not meet my p.f. Chang expectations. Food presentation was horrible I felt like I was served pigs food my rice covered my honey shrimp I had to dig and separate. Green beans tasted burnt, go to a different location this will just disappoint."}
{"text":"Really Sang? PF Changs? EVERYONE has been there...

Aha..I can challenge you on that! One of my friends has actually literally NEVER been to PF Changs so after hearing that blasphemy I carted her away to this location  for her to try the wonders of massacred Chinese food. 

PF Changs is not Chinese food. It's American food. I don't even think they are trying to elude that their food comes from the Fujian or Yunnan provinces. It's just food that tastes good. And for that, I like this place. It's dependable with it's dark woods, lightings, concrete-looking horses, decent service and reasonable prices. 

I get their Ma Po Tofu but instead of steamed broccoli that usually comes with the dish, I substitute with eggplant (yes, the same eggplant in their spicy eggplant). It's like I get 2 dishes but don't have to be a glutton and can practice portion control! Voila! Also, they don't charge me extra for this ($8.95). Their side dish options come in 2 sizes. The small sized options (about $3) easily satisfy 2 people. I enjoy the Crispy Green Beans, Spicy Asparagus and Shanghai Cucumbers. So when me and the hubs pander over here, we get the Ma Po Tofu (note eggplant sub) and 2 small sides. Cost of meal? About $15 bucks. Ummmm...for a sit-down place that's relatively nice, that's a steal! And our tummies are always happy after!

There are more \"interesting\" places around and yes, it's not independently owned and really a blasphemy for true Asian cuisine. But it's my guilty pleasure...good food, nice surroundings, sensitive to people preferring smaller portion sizes and impeccable service. '

And I'll even admit that after getting denied entry due to the size of our group at our favorite Austin, TX restaurant, PF Changs was the site where my bachelorette mayhem began. I'm not going to be pretentious today and admit that I like this place. Lots!"}
{"text":"First off James the bartender is awesome. I mentioned being cold and he brought me a glass with hot water to warm my hands. 

The dumplings should have been crispier but they were busy at the time, still I'd rather wait a couple mins longer than have non crispy pot stickers.

As always lettuce wraps are great! 

Love the look mein and chang's spicy chicken.

Fan of the whiskey sour too!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Had the lettuce cups this time.  Small pieces for lettuce that were not very crisp.  Meat was just ok not what it use to be.  Had a couple other dishes none outstanding so a so so meal. Give it a try you can judge for yourself"}
{"text":"I went to lunch today with a client and since Wildfish was closed we walked over to PF Chang's.

Remember when PF Chang's first opened in the original location at Fashion Square?  What a mob-scene that was back in the day with an hour plus wait for a table.

I haven't been here since shortly after this location opened.  They had a fair-sized lunch crowd and we were seated immediately.

I ordered the almond and cashew chicken and my client ordered the mongolian beef.  Both of us were happy with our dishes.

PF Chang's is definitely always a very consistent dining experience."}
{"text":"I was here today for lunch with some friends.  I had the Vietnamese Crab salad.  It tasted OK but there sure wasn't much crab in it.  I'm in no rush to come back."}
{"text":"2 hour wait on a Saturday night??  Not for us, baby.  We had reservations...Thank God!!!  We were seated in 10 minutes and the place was packed.  

Look, this is a chain, and the food is not the best.  The waitress was ok, not the best.  However, we enjoyed the meal, the cocktails and all of the ambiance.  We stuck with the traditional chinese deep fried yumminess and were not left with empty bellies or empty wallets.  

Good average stuff."}
{"text":"We got a lovely gift card from some friends and we decided to use it for our first time here for an Anniversary lunch.  First of all, the service was fantastic.  But the food was not outstanding for the price or the ambiance.  For $25 we got a salad, a bowl of sweet & sour soup, white rice, fried rice, and small portions of the Scallops and Pepper Steak.  The scallops were tender, but were very much coated & fried in an oriental sauce. It had no spice or bite at all. The pepper steak was edible, but not delicious or memorable by any means.  We appreciate the gift to be able to try it, but we were thankful we didn't come for a full dinner to spend extra.  As others have mentioned, there are plenty of other Chinese restaurants around town that are much, much better."}
{"text":"OK, so I am a chinese food whore.  Had the best in Hong Kong, Singapore, even chinatowns in LA and NY.  But I was at the mall shopping with a friend and thought we would pop in for a cocktail and maybe a bite.  I noticed the new Dim Sum on the menu.  We ordered some dumpling and they were absolutely disgusting.  Tasted like the kind you could buy from Costco.  Don't get me wrong, the bar service was pleasant, drinks good.  But to serve these tough, mushy, way too doughy dumplings was a total insult.  Horrible is stating it nicely."}
{"text":"Got take-out and it was ready on time. A bit pricy for three entrees and two hot and sour soups plus some rice almost $70 to feed four people. All in all a great place for healthy tasty Asian food. I have to stick with five stars. Too bad the don't ever run specials. Returned with five adults and one baby a two-year-old and we ordered a lot but $150 they are still pricy and for a Saturday night full but no wait also we left a $22 tip. Went for birthday got two free birthday desserts. Ice cream and banana fritters. Had American Express gift coupons."}
{"text":"We had a group of five plus a baby and it was good $140 plus a tip. The dessert was tiny and yucky. That's why only four stars. There was leftovers so plenty of food. The service was good but the server could have explained the dessert options better. I like restaurants that bring out samples of the desserts. Let's face it there's a markup on desserts so maybe they should change their policy. A little expensive but plenty to eat."}
{"text":"I went to dinner tonight and had some very delicious food. Our waiter was very polite but didn't show up enough to refill my water. 
But other then that, the food was great and tasty, and had ok prices. If your hungry for Chinese, this is not a bad place to go. People there are very friendly!"}
{"text":"The only reason I ate here during my visit to the new AZ Yelp office was because it was close to the hotel and I had a craving for Ahi. This location reminded me of the other PF's I have been to and the food was just as I remembered. Not spectacular, but still a very decent place to eat. I have nothing bad to say about this location, but nothing stood out either."}
{"text":"A busy Sunday night and don't get the VIP Duck. It does not taste like real Chinese duck if you know what I mean.

Shrimp with walnut was pretty good except for the balled honeydew in the dish.  

VIP Duck $19
Shrimp $15

We sat by the bar with minimal service."}
{"text":"I must say that the company I was with made my experience pretty good hence the four stars. Plus I was hungry and the bartender was really sweet and the food was not bad at all. 

We ordered some pan fried shrimp dumplings, the crab wontons, VIP Duck and the chicken with orange sauce. Everything was pretty tasty except the chicken with orange sauce or orange peel or orange whatever was too orangey (is that a word?) The duck was tender and not fatty like some places and the dumplings and wontons were really good with the sauces we had. 

I do like the dessert menu they offer as they have $2.00 mini's that come in a huge shot glass. Too many to list here (sorry) but I ended up getting the cherry cheesecake and it was really, really good. My friend got the fried bananas they were wrapped like egg rolls and deep fried and came with four different dipping sauces and ice cream. Not too shabby. Top it off with some wine and good company and a girl is very happy. 

So there you have it. You will either love it or hate it at PF Changs and on this particular night, I loved it."}
{"text":"Crispy geen beans, chicken lettuce wraps, california rolls and mongolian beef. Food fantastic and Jen provided excellent service. Yummo yummo. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The honey chicken was awful. It was all batter! I've eaten at many locations and this one was the worst. The service was terrible too, The young man was MIA and kept forgetting to bring things"}
{"text":"The food is always consistent because it's a chain but what makes this a better Changs is the service!  I find this neighborhood eatery to be quite a pleasant experience. We had a great server who never left us hanging. We had honest feedback from him about some new menu items we had not seen before. The food arrived hot and in a timely fashion. Clean tables. Clean utensils, chopsticks and plates. Drinks always filled. Seated immediately. Hostesses thanked us for choosing to dine there that night. And with curbside pick-up available, I would choose PF for take-out at $12 a plate any day over China-a-go-go or Panda Express. At least it's real chicken when it says so on the menu."}
{"text":"It's just okay. Not great. Just okay. I had Chicken Pad Thai. My wife got Orange Peel Shrimp. Portions are decent, but pricey for Chinese Food. We eat at their sister company Pei Wei all the time. I like it better and it's cheaper. My wife had lots of shrimp but I hardly had any chicken. Basically a bowl of noodles for $13. I'm not that big a fan of the new recipe."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the prices are reasonable. The reason for the 1-star is the service which to me makes or breaks a restaurant. Firstly, I called to reserve for a party of 18 and when we got there, the table setting was only for 12. Secondly, I was the first to order out of 18 people and ordered dumplings as appetizers - those came 45 mins later. Thirdly, when we were trying to get the attention of our server (her name is Bri), she just kept ignoring us and was not accommodating at all. Finally, when we ordered a \"surprise\" Great Wall of Chocolate for my sister's birthday, it didn't take her five minutes before she went up to my sister, told her \"you didn't tell me it was your birthday!\" and asked her for the dessert that she would like to order - after I'd ordered something specific."}
{"text":"Typical PF Changs. Hot and sour soup was so good. I had the Chilean sea bass. Which was really good.  We also had the dynamite shrimp which was good. My husband had the orange chicken which he liked but it wasn't what he expected he wanted it to be more on the sweet side but it was still tasty. We also had the salted caramel cake dessert and it was amazing. It was also kind of cool to sit outside you could seee the fountains across the street while you're eating."}
{"text":"Came to PF Chang's for my mother's 61st birthday as it's her favorite spot. Server Tommie delivered great service as we spent quality time eating great food. Thanks P.F. Chang's and Tommie for the great day!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time the other night we had a nice young server Jordan who was extremely knowledgeable when it came to the menu the dynamite shrimp and cocktails where great, the walnut shrimp were food, the pork dumplings were just ehh and so work the street noodles. We would definitely come back during there happy hour to sample additional starters"}
{"text":"The family had lunch here about a week ago.  Great food, pleasant atmosphere.

We started out with Lettuce Wraps, mmmmm good.  Love these.  After that, I had Chang's Spicy Chicken, my wife had the Kung Pau Chicken and our daughter had Buddha's Feast.  Delicious, we all went home full to the ears with just enough left over for great an evening snack.

As we were first timers at P.F. Chang's, we relied on our waiter for some recommendations and he was spot on.  Unfortunately, we can't remember his name, but he was very warm and friendly and attentive to all our needs.

We will definitely be back to P.F. Chang's.  Maybe next time we'll try the dinner menu.

Great food, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Normally I love PF changs and the service was ok. Other than not bringing the little mixing spices it was fine. But damnit the food today was really bad. Who messes up chicken pad Thai it was so bad. I've never in my life sent food back! Like not even one time in my life and I was seriously thinking about it today.... I didn't bc I don't do that, but holy crap I was close! The lettuce wraps were bad too. How can those be bad! I love them at Pei Wei so maybe this PF changs is having a bad day. I will give it another shot but maybe fire the cook??? Or make him a food runner re train?? I don't know what but put some sauce in that pad Thai at least:) 


Okay I'm done xoxox"}
{"text":"The waitress was super friendly. 
The food was good, a little on the cold side
The flavors were unique
The portion sizes are medium/average to small compared to the price."}
{"text":"My Wife and I enjoy PF Chang's and Pei Wei and we went into this restaurant and had a late lunch, not busy.  The hostess was on the phone at the front door  and when she finished her call, wiped her nose with her hand and proceed to take us to a table and placed the menu's down.  Mind you this was in the middle of the flu season and she did not use a tissue or wash her hands.  She then proceeded to pick up the extra place settings and stack them on a shelf close to our table.  Within a few minutes a waiter came by and I asked to see the manager, which he obliged.  I told the manger what happen and it appeared he could care less as he did not take the plates off the shelf and into the kitchen.  Shortly thereafter another waited came by and picked up the plates and took them to another table.  I wonder how many germs were on the plates?   Who got the flu from this untrained hostess?   Very poor management at a great chain.  I will think twice before I go back to this location.  Great food, but untrained in personal hygiene.  Watch out!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much and never being to a P.F. Chang I decided that this was the perfect opportunity, now I know what I was missing...nothing. 
   I ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce with extra shrimp and white rice. I picked it up one to two minutes after it was scheduled and ate it five minutes within that time frame. The sauce was flavorless and shrimp had no flavor. The peas provided a small amount of something, the chestnuts provided crunch and the egg a different consistency, but overall it was a meal full of blah! The rice container wasn't even full of rice, maybe 75% full and didn't taste that good either. Maybe eating in the restaurant instead of getting take out would be a different story because if the meal was packed really hot the sauce might have been watered down from the condensation formed inside the sealed container. Maybe I'm just trying to rationalize my meal who knows.
   I am presuming my meal was a fluke otherwise why would people come back, right? Needless to say, I will only come back if it's me versus extreme hunger and there are no other options. If I do come back it's chicken for me, maybe their sushi is better than this meal that I had."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a dogs age, and came here the first time and LOVED it. Great drinks, the food was good, service was excellent. I was so happy.
Well, what happens when you are pleasantly suprised with a chain? I'll tell you....You go back and it's NOT the same. It's why you DONT come to chains. Food was not good second time around. Drinks were OK, service was eh. It wasn't horrible, not at all. But man, that first time after 10 years.....disappointed like crazy the second time around. I doubt I'll be back before 2026."}
{"text":"This was the first PF Chang's I had ever been to way back in 96/97/98 I can't recall but this was the original in Vegas before the one on the blvd opened.  

Eating at P.F. Chang's is like taking an introductory class in Chinese food.  For those that don't know authentic Chinese or asian food, this place is a great start for new palates.  It doesn't try to be authentic so you shouldn't go in assuming to have true home cooked meals here.  

The focus for them is clean \"up-scale\" atmosphere and consistent dishes across all their restaurants so that people from the mid-west  (or where ever people live that have never tried Asian cuisine) can feel comfortable and get a great meal.   Then when a restaurant pops up in Cheyenne WY or Troy, Mich., you have instant success (just an example)... I've been to other PF's and this one still surpasses others in flavor, but for those of you that know authentic food, this still doesn't stack up.  

I give it three for those that are looking to dabble in new things Chinese and get a familiarity to some of the tastes and styles, then once their \"feet are wet\" start getting adventurous... in no time you'll be asking for sea cucumber and birds nest soup (well maybe not that adventurous ;)"}
{"text":"I love the lettuce wraps, kung pao chicken,  and not sure if they still have it, but the spicy ground chicken.  The taste is always consistently delicious.  Love coming here because we can always do dinner then a movie!"}
{"text":"Back again and will be in the future. Always enjoy the food. Good service bordering on a bit obsessive (checked on how we were doing at least 10 times). See ya next time we are over this way."}
{"text":"I had the duck, white rice, noodles and loved everything.  I tried the Saki, everyone enjoyed it but me.  The food portions were good, for the price they should be.  The environment was nice, clean wooden tables, lighting in brown-yellow chandiliers and somewhat dimmed.  We waited along time, they gave us a timer and we went and played slots for about 30-40 minutes.  The waiters were freindly, and the dinner was cool, we talked, stayed a while there, enjoyed the food and took some pics too."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly at 11 AM on a Sunday for lunch. I give my appetizer of crab wontons 3 stars, my husband's appetizer of Ahi Tartare with Avocado 4 stars, my entree of Mongolian beef 4 stars, and my husband's entree of Lobster Rice 1.5 stars (way too salty! should have sent it back to the kitchen! hardly ate it!). The manager came over to greet us. The waitress was nice and gave us drink refills."}
{"text":"We were seated at a comfortable and clean booth. Our waiter was prompt and courteous. My appetizer of crab Rangoon contained actual crab. My husband's ahi poke bowl was not what he expected, but it tasted good. My Korean chicken stir-fry was a little too spicy for my liking. My husband felt so-so about his crispy honey chicken. I appreciate that their food is made from scratch, and their prices were acceptable."}
{"text":"Bad meal.  Wonton soup was not hot.  Noodle was under cooked.  Dim sum pork dumplings were cold and probably premade day before.  Buyer beware on this  place."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant I don't think this place is bad. It's not the best Chinese food around but it hits the spot when you're looking for an inexpensive dinner. Right now they're offering a prix-fixe menu for two for $39.95. Yup, dinner for two for forty bucks, not forty bucks each. The meal comes w/ two orders of soup (we both got the egg drop soup -- wasn't bad), one appetizer (pork potstickers -- tasty), two entrees (cashew chicken -- pretty good; mongolian beef -- crispy and flavorful), and two desserts (carrot cake -- it was ok; chocolate cake -- best thing all night). The desserts are mini desserts (served in shot glasses) not their regular sized ones. All in all, not bad for the price. The service was pretty good also."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's is one of my favorites. I recommend making a reservation unless you don't mind waiting to be seated for a while at times. The wait for me in the past has been up to a 2 hour wait so I always call ahead of time to make sure I wont have to wait too long when getting there. Parking is another thing the lot can be pretty full at times but, when people know where good food is they tend to gather!

We like getting the \"Four-Course Meal For Two For $39.99\". You get your choice of 2 soups, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 small desserts. For $1.95-$3.95 you can upgrade to 1 larger dessert but for us we like choosing our own smaller ones that are included in the price already. 

I love their \"Egg Drop Soup\". It is some of the best I have ever had. I usually always start out with \"Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps\". The lettuce is always so fresh and crisp and the chicken tastes so darn good. I just can't get enough of the lettuce wraps! We also got \"Pork Fried Dumplings\". These are chocked full of delicious flavored pork. If you like dumplings then these are a must and they have veggie too. For my main meal I usually get \"Crispy Honey Chicken\". The chicken comes with crispy rice sticks under the chicken and u tell them to leave that off so I can mix my white rice with the chicken, yum! For the dessert menu I would eat one of everything it all sounds good! The dessert I did choose this time was \"Salted Caramel Chocolate Cake\". Sounds good right? It was just so-so. I wasn't upset at all it was perfectly edible the flavor just didn't add up to the name so I will try a different one next time.

I had a \"Strawberry Daiquiri\" that was $6.50 and delicious.

There is a outdoor patio if you want to eat outside.

Check out their website. They have a \"Warrior Rewards\" that gives you freebies from time to time. Just for signing up you get a free order of lettuce wraps!"}
{"text":"This location is in the Planet Hollywood casino so to get to it you have to go through the casino floor which means walking through clouds of cigarette smoke.

We were with a large group (about 24 people) and the menu had already been chosen by the person holding the shindig.  The meal consisted of: vegetarian lettuce wraps, fried green beans, pork dumplings, lemongrass salad, Kung Pao scallops, honey chicken, mongolian beef, pork lo mein, and brown and white rice. 

Perhaps it was because of the size of the group, but everything (except the Mongolian beef) seemed really greasy.  Greasier than usual.  And the scallops were overly fried and greasy at the same time.  Still, I left with a full stomach and satisfied taste buds.

Their Moscow Mule was fabulous, though.  The service was really slow because it was only one server for about half the meal.  Once he had backup, things went much better."}
{"text":"This P.F. Chang's is usually pretty busy on the weekends. I don't come to this one all that often anymore since we have a couple other locations away from the Strip. Another reason is the parking lot. Being near the Strip there is a lot of foot traffic that walks around this P.F. Chang's and through the parking lot. I had a gift card and since hubby and I were nearby this location we decided to pick up some food to-go for dinner. After pulling in and finding a spot to park, we both opened our car doors to get out and 2 females quickly approached both sides of our car and asked for money and or cigarettes. There was also a guy in a wheelchair that I saw on the way inside who was holding a sign asking for money. Given the popularity of this location even after all of these years, I would think P.F. Chang's would have a security guard outside to help keep the customers who are patronizing the business safe or at least feel that way. 

Kung Pao Chicken Jicama Street Tacos ($7.50) - Chicken that is wok-tossed in chili sauce with Fresno peppers and chopped peanuts accompanied by cucumbers. You get jicama shells to stuff the deliciousness in and the menu says it comes with 3 per order, but honestly they have always given me about 4 or 5 at any location I have ordered them from. Make sure if you are ordering to-go that you request the jicama shells be put on top of the chicken or in a separate container so they don't get soggy. The cucumber is put on the side since it's cold and I personally love the fresh taste it adds to the chicken, but it can be left off if that isn't your thing. I get this almost every time and am so glad they added it to the menu and hope it stays because it's so tasty!

Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($9.25) - Chicken, mushrooms, green onion and water chestnuts make up this dish that has been a popular favorite by many for years. Oh, yes it also comes with those crispy rice sticks, but I don't like those and request they be left out. They forgot this last time and it wasn't underneath the chicken thank goodness, so eating around it wasn't an issue. I always ask for extra lettuce cups and they are added at no additional charge. The chicken lettuce wraps are something my hubby and I both really enjoy and the portion of chicken is generous which is why extra lettuce cups are needed. The lettuce is put in a plastic baggie so the stay cold, crisp, fresh and ready to be filled with that chicken goodness. 

Chicken Fried Rice ($9.75) - This is supposed to have rice tossed in soy sauce with egg, carrots, bean sprouts and scallions. I requested the bean sprouts be left out and they wasn't the only thing that ended up being missing from the dish. The rice wasn't tossed all the way through with the soy sauce, some of the rice was crunchy, the carrots were sliced bigger than usual and off to the side instead of tossed with the rice and there were no scallions. Some of the egg was overcooked. There was maybe 4 pieces of chicken in the rice and I paid more to have meat in the dish (the veggie rice is cheaper). The rice was a major fail.

Chicken Lo Mein ($10.50) - Noodles tossed in soy sauce with chicken. This dish usually comes tossed with veggies, but I prefer my noodles \"plain\" which just means noodles and sauce without the rabbit food. The noddles were delicious and at first I wondered where the chicken was and then after giving the noddles a toss with my fork I was pleased with the amount that was under the noodles. Much different than I experienced with the fried rice! 

Chocolate Raspberry and Sweet Vanilla Cream Wontons (2 for $3.50) - Chocolate and raspberry filling inside a wonton that is dusted in powdered sugar on one side makes for one tasty treat! I wish the wonton wasn't overcooked a tad, but the chocolate and raspberry filling was very good! You get some fresh raspberries on the side and one each of chocolate and raspberry sauces. Dip your wonton in both it's good! The inside of the vanilla cream was supposed to have a vanilla cream cheese flavor and if they meant vanilla = bland they sure accomplished that. The wonton was way overdone and crispy and the filling really lacked flavor. The chocolate and raspberry wontons were much better and the perfect small bites after eating a big meal for dessert. 
Take a look around."}
{"text":"Most of the meal was good but oddly enough the broccoli was very bitter in two of our meals. The waiter entered part of our meal incorrectly. 

Overall a decent meal with a couple stumbling blocks."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for lunch yesterday. It was busy at most restaurants with long wait times, but we were able to get seated quickly here, and for good reason.

This restaurant is disgusting! My wife already did a detailed review and posted both pics and video of the mess in this establishment. I will add to it and say that none of the mess on the table next to us was moved until I had to ask for it to be done and received glaring eyes from the waitress upon my request. It seems all of the staff there and the manager seem it acceptable to leave tables filthy, with food particles on the tables and floor. 

My wife asked for me to get her food to go as she up and left the restaurant. I stayed and ate my meal, which was a mistake as I developed digestive issues about an hour later. I'll spare you the details. So if the seating area is filthy imagine what the kitchen is like!"}
{"text":"A chain, with good food, always consistent. I don't normally do chains when I travel but I had a large group and had to balance Vegans, Vegetarians, and regular eaters.  Thanks for working with us."}
{"text":"I should predicate this review with a little background.  I've visited this P.F. Changs probably 6 times over the past three years.  It's usually because there are enough people at work who want to go that we all go.  I found something on the menu that I liked and I stuck with it.  Prior visits were unspectacular, but once I found \"Dan Dan Noodles\" I was set.

At least I was until the visit before my most recent visit.  They were bland in an ironic sort of extremely salty way.  Do you know what I mean?  I mean, it's hard to say that something that tastes like it just came out of a salt shaker is bland, but if that's the ONLY taste it has, then that's what my last order of Dan Dan Noodles tasted like.

THIS time, I resolved to find something new to replace Dan Dan Noodles (can you tell I like saying Dan Dan Noodles?  Because I do) for future visits.  Meh.  I'm done with PF Changs, at least lunch and dinner (because I still have a free happy hour dim sum for checking in on Yelp!).  

I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and found the Kung lacking and also no Pao.  What they did NOT leave out, however, was the salt.  Holy crap!  The waitress (good waitress) gave me a replacement Mr. Pibb, suggesting I'd need it to finish my Kung Pao (presumably because it would be so spicy)...and I did need it.  But just to wash down the salt.

It was like I ordered a salt lick with a side of ...I'm not sure what...some sort of cold vinegar preparation of sliced vegetables.  I was stuck as to whether they were pairing pseudo-kim che with my faux chinese food.  Regardless it was not awesome.  I'm not kidding when I say the most enjoyable part of the meal was the fried rice, which is not to say that the fried rice was good...it just wasn't as awful as everything else.

People like this place, and I don't want my review to sway them away, but it was not good.  The atmosphere is great, the wait staff was quick and efficient...but the food is expensive and not good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food at PF Chang's. I ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein and it was delicious. I did not like how loud the restaurant was. It really takes away from the experience."}
{"text":"This review is based entirely on customer service OR lack thereof.

I had a new direct report join yesterday 8/1. Both of us are in business attire. During lunch we are sitting across from each other, talking business. After lunch, the server brings the check... One check. He NEVER asked us if we wanted one check. He then proceeds to hand the check to my direct report- a guy. Of course!! I quickly reach for the check. My direct report protests and asks to split. I overrule and pay anyway. The server then proceeds to make a joke about how, \"She.'s made up her mind\"... Yes, the little lady has made up her mind. Sexism and patriarchy at its worst.

Usually, I choose to ignore BS. But this offended me on so many levels; 

1. First, two Indian Americans walk in and despite the business attire and business chatter at the table, you assume they are a couple. You bring one check without us asking for it. This has happened to me before with people pointing to random brown kids and telling me how beautiful they are (Um, thank you but they arent mine).

2. Second, you immediately assume that the man will pay the bill, in this day and age. Leave the patriarchy at home. 

3. Third, even after my employee tells you that I am his boss, you treat it as a joke. As if, I couldnt possibly be his boss. 

Worst thing was, this server had a new guy shadowing him."}
{"text":"Had a very nice lunch for Father's Day with my folks and Brothers Family. They got us seated right away (7 of us) and our waitress Anna was excellent. The food was fresh and the service even better. They even brought out a yummy dessert for my Wife's Birthday :-)"}
{"text":"Food was generally okay, but a couple of plates tasted a bit on the burnt greasy side. I've had better PF Chang meals at other locations.  Usually they are very consistent on food from location to location but this one seemed a little off. Service was good and sat quickly with a large party on a Thursday night. Lighting in the dining area was annoyingly dark and beyond romantic. I think our waiter could have used a flashlight to find his way around our table.  If you have an option, I would pick another Phoenix or Scottsdale location. If not, this wasn't so bad I would say stay away."}
{"text":"Usually I don't like P.F. Chang's but Las Vegas one is really good actually. And they have good service waitress name is Philip he's really nice guy I wish every place have this kind of service"}
{"text":"I USED to love this place.  The service has really gone downhill the past couple of years.  It was a Monday lunch and the place was packed!  So, the servers were running around like chickens with their head cut off.  Our table was sticky, it took forever to get a drink and even longer to have our order taken.  The food took forever to come out, and when it did, we got two bowls of rice with it.  Weird cause we ordered appetizers.  Then, some other server came over with lo mein and set it on our table saying it was a mistake for another table and free for us.  OK.  Weird again.  We had to flag our server down for re-fills, waited forever for our bill and again for him to run the cards.  Luckily we were not in a hurry or there would have been an even bigger issue.  The managers were nowhere to be seen and the hostesses were talking in a group at the front of the restaurant.  Shouldn't they be walking around helping?? It was a crazy debacle.  I love their food, but the service will make me not go back in there for a while."}
{"text":"Pf Chang's has really gone downhill in the last few months. Apparently after renovations they felt like they could increase prices without actually making the restaurant better. We came in last weekend for an early dinner before a movie, and I left with a bad taste in my mouth. My husband ordered a Woodford reserve on the rocks with a splash of soda water and I ordered a Woodford reserve Manhattan; my husband's glass seemed really full and watered down and I received a very sweet old fashioned. I let our waitress know about the wrong drink order, the harm no foul, but it took awhile to get my correct drink. My entree had good flavor but it was overcooked. The worst part was the bill. Two cocktails, an appetizer and two entrees cost $63 ($75 after tip)?! Each Woodford cocktail cost $10.75, what is this, scottsdale?? I bartend at a bar in Tempe and know this is price gauging. 

This will be my last visit to pf Chang's for a long time. There are too many great restaurants in the valley  to throw my hard earned toward mediocracy."}
{"text":"Always a great experience.. 1st time at this location but not my 1st a P.F.'s... Started with the plum wine.. Very sweet wine.. Love it! Starters:  TUNA TATAKI  &  CHANG'S CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS 
Try the SEARED AHI SALAD.. Yummy and fresh.
Ended the night with BANANA SPRING ROLLS
Ya not all for me other people in my group.. Just focused on my moment there..."}
{"text":"It's always good and always a fav. I'm writing this for a new menu item, their lobster fried rice. I admit I didn't read the menu and went off the server's recommendation. I expected something like their old crab fried rice or what you would get with shrimp fried rice: shrimp mixed in with the rice.

Wasn't the case with this dish. It's more fried lobster with rice on the side. Barely touching is the only mixing you'll see. Seemed like two dishes not one. Very odd. Even manually mixing them won't bring together the flavors. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I understand this is a busy place. Hey, it's P.F. Chang's! So, I know there can be a wait, but I've been to several P.F. Chang's around the country and this wait was ridiculous.
We didn't have to wait to be seated. We had to wait for our food. It took foreverrrrrrrr.
The server was okay, if not annoyed that we didn't know what we wanted as soon as we sat down. Our dining partners had never been to a P.F. Chang's before and had to take their time to look at the menu. 
I ordered the butternut squash dumplings. They were okay, but they tasted like Chef Boyardee ravioli with Velveeta. They just weren't doing it for me. 
So, between the long wait for food (and, the manager did come to the table after about 20-30 minutes to tell us our food would be out shortly) and the \"meh\" taste of the food, I can't write a great review. Usually I love P.F. Chang's. 
With that said, though, we all cleaned our plates, so it was definitely edible :-)"}
{"text":"One of my staples. Service is knowledge and friendly. The atmosphere is intimate and comfortable. Food is delicious; my favorites include the Mongolian beef and the Kung pao chicken."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, never go wrong with this place. The lettuce wraps are a MUST TRY, even if you're not a huge fan wraps, this one is amazeballs! The Orange chicken is amazing! This location in particular is pretty quite, not too much traffic and wait is normally not as long as others in town. If you love fruity, blended drinks, try the Nutty Uncle w/whip cream-SHIT\"S THE BOMB! It's no longer on the menu but they will make for you if you ask. ;-)"}

it is so clean and comfortable

validated our parking 
prices reasonable 
Mgr was a young lady with a very sweet accent that came to our table to say hello and i thought that was just so nice 
we will be back !"}
{"text":"used to love this place, not so much anymore.  The recipes or dishes changed.  The lettuce wraps sauce changed, now it's too hot for us.  So that dish was out.  Shrimp dumplings, changed sauce, not same delish sauce as before, so that dish was out.  actually everything we had was either too spicy now, didn't taste that great or was loaded with cilantro, not everyone loves that herb.  Whoever changed their menu is an idiot.  We wont' be back"}
{"text":"Meh... Pei Wei is better and costs less.  Would probably be better at lunch with the less expensive menu."}
{"text":"This place just doesn't do it for me.  The food isn't bad, but it's definitely forgettable.  I just don't like being there, either."}
{"text":"Thank you so very very very much to the management Hallie.  She literally helped me with immediately with an error that was on my gift card.  

Also Hallie visited our table during our meal to see if everything and everybody was okay.

 Also our server, Aaron, was really helpful and sweet.  I am a very very picky eater.  I don't like onions, garlic, peppers, mushrooms, broccoli, rice, etc.  Aaron was awesome in his help as I selected my food.   

Very rarely do  I eat dessert.  I love their  pineapple coconut ice cream.  There banana sprung rolls are good, but the ice cream is to die for.  The two come together."}

{"text":"PF Changs is an A-OK Americanized chain Chinese restaurant...

Maybe I should just refer to it as PF Chain?  

No matter how I refer to it, I have no problem going to PF Changs - especially when I'm with a group of people that cannot decide where to go.  PF Changs to the rescue - there is something on the menu for everyone... vegetarians, meat eaters, boring bland food fans, seafood lovers, spicy enthusiasts, etc... they offer white rice, brown rice, noodles, and I suppose no-carb dishes if you eliminate all of the above.  

I actually ordered PF Changs to-go recently and despite the fact that they did not include utensils of any sort in their packaging, the eggplant dish I ordered and the steamed shrimp and veggies with brown rice really hit the spot.  

If you're going to eat at a chain, PF Changs is not a bad option... while it's never my first choice of restaurants to dine at, you can't go wrong at PF Changs either... just don't expect anything too authentic and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Such yummy food , and great service - very attentive . Our waiter was Jeremy! Great meal!!"}
{"text":"P.F. Changs at this location had really good customer service. Our waiter was very attentive and even recommended a good red wine to drink (which was $11) but I can't remember the name of it. Anyways the food was okay for me, I got the street noodles or something like that and to me it reminded me of pad thai (which was more spicy and less sweet) with shrimp. My mom got the moo goo gai pan (sorry if misspelled and butchered) and it literally had no flavor, it was so bland that my mom had to ask for salt (which is very rare for her to ask of that which meant it seriously had no taste). My mom's friend got shrimp fried rice and their version of orange chicken which was not much different that panda express to me, just a bit better in taste.

Overall It wasn't SUPER good or worth the price really (in my case). I mean P.F. Changs is a good place if you want more expensive asian food, but im sure you can find somewhere else that serves good asian food for less."}
{"text":"Boy can this place get crowded, expect to wait for a table. Food is always good. Food and especially the drinks are pricey. Serving portions of food small and drinks weak. Very noisy but fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my Mongolian beef and pork pot stickers, but 
There was NO presentation of pfc mixing sauces. 
One of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mill Non franchise is PRESENTATION and experience.  I was extremely disappointed by the LACK of presentation. 

Reservations:
Our party arrived about 15 minutes before our 5:30 reservations.

At 6:11 we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party . Obviously someone dropped the ball here.....

When we requested silverware for the table. Our waitress blamed it on the hostess. Yes, theHostess should have provided silverware.. However It was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck. As a Patron I could care less who's fault it is; just $@&&@in fix it. Defiantly took away from my pfc experience.

My Hot and sour soup is usally served with\"noodley\" things that I drop in the soup. We weren't given any \"noodley \" things . Not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc isn't selling food as much as they are selling an experience. This experience is what sets this restaurant apart."}
{"text":"We just ate at PF Chang's tonight -- and I seriously can't believe the amount of food that was on the table. It was seasoned well and piping hot. Our server was very attentive - actually saving our 3 year old from eating a hot pepper on the calamari (which they comped us because the chicken wraps came out after the kids' meals)."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar to watch the hockey playoff game and had a great time! Our bartender was super friendly, efficient, and attentive to our orders. Since we were sitting at the actual bar, we saw the interaction of the wait staff with each other as well. They seemed to genuinely get along and treat each other respectfully. Not always a requirement for the places we eat but definitely added that much more great atmosphere to the fun we were having. We will be back! Oh.....and the food and drinks were AMAZING!!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!  Our waiter was so concerned about a bigger table (bigger tip) that he rushed us through our dinner and didn't really check on us...and no fortune cookies were even offered"}
{"text":"Sit at the bar Tara and Cari are Awesome and have great personalities for this type work. They have fun but as to now not so it is unprofessional or interferres with your dinner.

Food is always good, hot and delicious.

I will return as I have, always to PF changs."}
{"text":"Walked in for a salad. We met the friendly hosts. Very nice and funny. We had a supposed 10 min wait. We ended up waiting 6. Not bad. We ordered chick wraps and the chicken salad. Nicolas birdsaw was our waiter. I repeat Nicolas birdsaw was our waiter. He made sure with a smile of course we knew who he was. The food was good. Nicolas birdsaw actually originally wasn't our waiter but because we moved and no waiter came to serve us he took over. He was very friendly and had a dry sense of humor. But service was good and food was good. No complaints.  He took control like a manager would and made sure we had a good experience.  Thank you, Nicolas birdsaw."}

{"text":"Two weeks ago I was pulling a late night in the office and was getting hungry.  Needing something extremely close to pick up that didn't require a trip in the car, I called PF Chang's and ordered the Ginger Chicken with Broccoli for pickup when I could sneak out of the office to walk over.

The phone call went OK, but could have done without the three separate attempts to upsell me appetizers or another entree.  After picking up the food and bringing it back to the office the quality of the food was clearly not much better than the freezer isle.  The rice was greasy and the chicken was bland.  The sauce was the only saving grace to the whole meal, but could have done without so much sugar.

+1 star for having high quality takeout containers that I can reuse as tupperware in the office, but in the end I will gladly go elsewhere versus low quality Chinese takeout at twice the price."}
{"text":"I went with my uncle recently for lunch Andreas not impressed with serving size or the service itself. The food was delicious but it gave me the impression that during lunch nobody there cared about the quality of anything."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I do not like national chain restaurants in general.  Let me add that I do not think that the food served here is authentic Chinese - but I admit that I cannot be a judge of this.
All that said, I really like this place.  It serves fresh tasting food that is flavorful and well seasoned.  Portion size is very generous.  Service is very friendly and attentive.  They have a fairly reasonable gluten free menu as well.  
So, I do recommend eating here if you are interested in having a good dining experience with generous servings of quality food."}
{"text":"TOO PRICEY.   WHATS THE POINT?
$52 for 2 for lunch.  No liquor.  What's up with that?
Why would anyone go here?  Oh yeah.  So that you can say you dined at PF Changs?  Get over it and save your money.  Sure the food was edible but so is food at Panda Express.  Not impressed.  Too much money and not even a buzz.  Booo!!!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place a big hand! They rock on service. I have very picky family members, they travel around the county and eat at the best restaurants and they know and expect great service. As soon as we sit down my mother in law gives very specific detail on what she wants. Our waitress listened and was very good. Everything down to the last detail. If it was not right she corrected it instantly and never batted an eye. Of course the food it always good too. You can't go wrong here, great service and great food."}
{"text":"Once again tried this location and horrible!! We didn't get rice for our meals!! We didn't get any of there sauces like hot mustard and chili paste we got 1 really hot mixed for 5 dishes! The chicken was undercooked so we couldn't eat it! I got 4 half ripped in half pieces  of lettuce for my chicken lettuce wraps!  Green beans were so under cooked that they had to be microwaved  to be enabled! So my $50 dollar purchase was a waste!! I ended up getting taco bell!! Management  wasn't present and wouldnt come up to talk to me about making it right so this will be my last time at this location!! I dont not suggest this Location at all i would definitely go to the district on green Valley way  better service and quality!!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner a few nights ago. The service was awesome! Our waitress never let our glasses empty and was over the top professional and courteous. My wife and I were checking it out on date night. We tried the \"chang's for 2\" thinking it would be awesome. Should have been since it was almost $50 for it. When I say what I am about to say, know that the food was pretty good. 

It starts you off with a some soup. We opted for the egg drop soup. This was very good! We would get that again. Next, the egg rolls came out. They were over the top greasy and were not very good. 
The next course was dinner. I have to say, while it was not bad, it was no better then pei Wei. We could have saved $20 and the drive and just go to pei Wei.  We finished it up with the \"Great Wall\" cake. Now that is worth coming back for. Very good with fresh berries and raspberry sauce.

All in all, it was a good experience, but a little overpriced for the quality."}

{"text":"I really wanted to like PF Changs, unfortunately they just didn't do it for me. 
We went on a Wednesday night around 7, and the place was packed. Dining room, was VERY loud. 

A friend of mine made me promise I would try the Changs spicy chicken, as it is his fav dish there. Let me say for $16, i was expecting a lot more than a mediocre plate of chicken, with a tiny bowl of dry white rice (not sticky at all). They couldn't even cook rice right??? Something was seriously wrong. 

The service was trying way to hard, to be way fancier than they are. Someone else mentioned the \"better than you\" attitude that seems to exude from the wait staff, and I couldn't agree more. They were pretentious, and overbearing. Couldn't help but giggle at the nicely dressed wait staff walking around with their noses up, and white Chinese take out boxes on trays. A walking contradiction?? 
I have paid $5 for takeout that blows away the entree that I ordered that night. 

Also knowing that you can buy these famous entrees, frozen now, in the grocery store has cheapened the product. Just just pick up your stir fry right next to the TGI Fridays frozen mozz sticks. 

PF Changs is having a identity crisis. Are you fancy and overpriced? Yet still serve mediocre food?? Why is this place so popular???

Overall I would never go back, just not for me."}
{"text":"The food is a solid 4. Tasty and fresh.  I just don't love coming here, and so don't make it here that much.  I don't know if it is the studied cool apathy of the hostesses out front.  Or, the fact that it does not feel special to be here, or that you are especially welcomed or much valued.  They do a great job of lunch specials, and the food is quite consistent.  I have enjoyed the occasional specials.  They should offer more."}
{"text":"Hubby had the taste for Chinese food, here we come Mr. Chang.  
I'm starving so we need to order right NOW....

I ordered sauteed eggplant with brown rice and hubby ordered shrimp lo mein. 

Surprisingly,. it was very good. I like PF Chang but from my last experience it wasn't the best Chinese food. 

PF Chang has changed a lot, the menu is smaller, and easier to read.  They have added more vegetarian items.  

The non alcolhic drinks were EVERYTHING.... I had a ginger beer and my hubby had  a strawberry cucumber ice tea.  They were both very refreshing and so good.

I would definitely come back for round two, three....

You know my saying....food is food but good food is what I'm paying for.  Keep up the good work Mr. Chang!"}
{"text":"My family recently discovered Molly Woo's, in the northern Columbus area, and realized just how amazing \"upscale americanized chinese\" food can be.  We had never been to a P.F. Chang's, but we're hopeful this would be a similar experience to Molly Woo's; instead we left disappointed.

We made reservations for 1:15 yesterday, arrived on time, and were seated immediately (I don't think a reservation would have been necessary).  The interior is beautiful,  spaced out well for privacy, and is dimly lit to make for a nice atmosphere.  Volume is about average.  Our waitress was waiting on a large party when we were seated and so it took her about ten minutes to get to our table.  My wife orders the red sangria, and for her meal she tries the gluten-free firecracker chicken.  I try the crispy honey chicken.  Food comes along shockingly fast at 13 minutes.  The dishes we ordered are very similar to what we have at Molly Woo's, but we found both to not even be in the same league.  Regarding the crispy honey chicken: the chicken was not crispy at all as the name would indicate, but was actually kind of soggy for the most part.  I did find some occasional pieces that were hard, but not crispy.  The consistency from piece to piece was not good.  One piece mushy, another piece like a rock.  Flavor was okay, but nothing I will be craving anytime soon.  I finished the majority of my food, but would not reorder.  

My wife's red sangria was pretty solid, but was a little light on alcohol.  Her GF firecracker chicken was cooked pretty well with the texture of the chicken being good, but the overwhelming salt made the dish barely edible.  The MAJOR letdown we had was that my wife has a gluten sensitivity, she ordered off the gluten-free menu, and ended up sick for about 16 hours due to gluten she consumed from the meal.  My wife only has a gluten sensitivity - not a full blown gluten allergy.  A little gluten doesn't turn her world upside down.  She was sick though after eating a supposedly gluten-free dish from P.F. Chang's.  I have never seen her have issues after ordering a gluten-free item ANYWHERE, at any time.  

Two stars rating is justified as follows: good service (our waitress was very sweet), beautiful interior, mediocre food, questionable price point for what we received, and a supposed gluten-free item that was not.  Our bill was about $45 for one drink and two entrees.  I have to believe there are other restaurants in the area that one would receive better food for this price.  Won't return to this P.F. Chang's location.  We are chicken junkies and if they can't get two chicken dishes right, I have to believe they wouldn't get the others right either."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to go to chain restaurants but my in-laws gifted us a PF Chang's gift card for our anniversary. We came for lunch on a Sunday around 1pm. Hostess was friendly but we were seated awkwardly close to other patrons on a half-booth/half-table area. There were not a lot of people there but it seemed we were all crushed into the same area. Our table was also pretty sticky. We ordered a sushi appetizer and the tuna was high quality, though the sushi did not stay together very well. For our meals we ordered the spicy chicken and the orange chicken. Both were tasty and had a good flavor. Our waitress was friendly and attentive but accidentally gave us the wrong check at the end. She quickly fixed her mistake. Overall pleasant experience, the manager also came over and checked on us during our meal, which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Dear P.F. Chang Management,

While I find the food consistently delicious, the service is consistently horrible... So sad though,  Kierland is such a great location with a nice patio.  This is not a first time that we wait for over 30 minutes for food and I'm told I can't have my dish prepared \"mild\" even though I've had it prepared this way numerous times before by other attentive servers who really try to please their customers.  I guess they don't work there any longer...   

And, what's up with the dirty, food encrusted stained aprons?  People, don't you know that when we sit and the servers stand in front of us, it is in our full view (especially on the patio) that staff is wearing several meal drippings from the past few days?! It's gross!  I though it was just our waitress but I look around and notice they are all sporting equally stained uniforms.  

Some man, I guess the manager - or at least I hope, stops by to ask if everything is ok while we still sit at an empty table with our miniature drinks waiting for food now close to 30 minutes.   What I want to say is, that if you are going to charge for a strawberry limade with a chopped up cucumber slice $3.95 and not refill, serve them at least in an 8oz glass that is not overfilled with ice - but he doesn't stick around long enough to get an answer. 

Still, we give the dessert another try as I love the banana spring rolls.  Sadly, after 15 minutes we are told that the kitchen burnt our bananas and we are asked if we want to wait any longer for another order.  Really?  Are you sure you want me to have these?  No, it's fine, don't do me any more favors.  Thank God, Starbucks is next door."}

{"text":"I love changs but Sean at the bar was too pushy and ruined the experience.

We walked in at 9:45 and the first thing he says is \"hey kitchen closes in 10 minutes\". I said that's odd cause the doors are open until 10.

He didn't make our sauce.  He didn't offer an orange for our Blue Moons.   He just wanted to go home.  Work lunch shifts buddy."}
{"text":"Chris our server was excellent.  We always hit PF Changs when we visit Vegas.  This location is way better.  Off the strip and no long waits.  Save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Sit out side on the patio if the weather is nice. The food is always excellent and the staff is friendly. Get the Changs chicken and Mongolian beef with asparagus."}
{"text":"Pf changs is pretty good, there changs spicy chicken is a really good dish, the service is great! I go there almost every two weeks."}
{"text":"Stopped here while vacationing in Phoenix, Arizona.  Went for dinner - missing \"Happy Hour\" by 5 minutes!  Good selections and nice wine.
Went back next day for Happy Hour - which is longer if you sit at the
Bar.  We split crab puffs, tempura crispy green beans and two others.
Recommend -all delicious!"}
{"text":"I gave my Mother a large gift card for Mother's Day. She has used it twice at this location .  They dined in the first time. It was not up to the usual. The second time was take out. I am so upset ! It made them ill. On top of that very small portions.  I took my Mother there not long ago and she enjoyed it so I got the gift card. I will have to let the health department know! Terrible!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of chain Chinese food, but it seems to me that most the local places in the Phoenix area use such low quality ingredients for the food. This PF Changs, like most others, is fairly reliable. The food came out quickly and it was flavorful, but not necessarily exceptional."}
{"text":"Lo recomiendo comida buena atención inmediata, esta ubicado en toda la avenida principal de Las Vegas"}
{"text":"The service was very slow and the food was not very good. The waitress was very nice, but apperently very busy. No one checked on us after we got our food and my drink was never refilled. My mom ordered gluten free pad Thai, it was bland and made her sick, so very likely NOT really gluten free. I ordered crispy honey chicken, it tasted just like sweet and sour chicken and the rice was very bland and slightly crunchy. Overall I was very disappointed and will probably not go back."}
{"text":"I have been to other PF Changs and this one by far exceeded my previous experience by far. Our server Brandon was one of the best servers I ever had.  I have been in he service industry for years he was fantastic. This restaurant should be lucky to have him He was professional, attentive,  kind, and he had a good sense of humor.  He didn't let our drinks get empty and always pretty bussed our dishes. He timed our appetizers, main course and desserts in a timely manor as well.  I will definitely come back and request him as my server. Our meals where amazing from the lettuce wraps, dynamite shrimp to the melon shrimp, even our kids couldn't get enough of the fried chicken with honey and sweet and sour sauce. The ambiance was not loud nice lighting music etc. All of the staff here did great from the greet at the door, the seating, the sever,  the runners and even our exit. Thank you for a great Sunday dinner."}
{"text":"It's your typical PF Changs.  The food is really reasonable and they give you good portions.  We always get the 2 for $39.95 meal.  It's a great deal.  You each get a soup, share an appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 mini desserts.  After our meal we simply weren't hungry for dessert.  Our waiter was nice and instead took our drinks off the menu."}
{"text":"I should have read the other reviews before I decided to try this place.  First impressions are important.  I ordered my food at 12:25 online for pickup at 1:00 pm, I arrived at 12:55 and did not get my food until 1:20.  Having to wait 20 minutes for my food past the \"pickup/promised\" time didn't help things.  There was a lady waiting also who looked as annoyed as I was.  We were offered something to drink, but I was hoping to not be there long enough to finish it so I declined.  I expected my meal to be free or discounted or something due to the wait - I didn't even get chopsticks or a cookie.

I got the Buddha's Feast with no mushrooms - they got that part right.  However, there is no flavor in the sauce and the snap peas and asparagus are tough.  The broccoli and carrots are okay.  The tofu is a weird texture and I don't like how it was cooked.  In the absence of siracha at the office, I put texas pete on the dish just to add some sort of flavor.  

I won't be going back... I'll stick to the hole-in-the-wall chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Decent amount of food for the price. Good quality food and a decent variety. Is always busy but got in right away with a reservation."}
{"text":"We went here instead of waiting out a table at True Foods.  I typically do not eat Chinese food - I'm more of a fan of Japanese or Thai.  I went here with family - who seemed happy with their lunches.  I ordered the Eggplant dish (one of the few vegetarian options).  It was ok - the sauce was very thick and salty - not really to my taste.  It was OK, but definitely not something I would want to try again.  I'd recommend sticking out the wait at True Foods or another restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"This place has a great look.  You feel like you are entering a very nice restaurant, but that is where the illusion ends.  I will admit that the food was good, generic, but good.

The hostesses seemed put out that we had come in and placed us at the worst possible table, right at the entrance, although there were plenty of empty tables.  It took almost 20 minutes for our waiter to show up and take our orders, and another 10 minutes to get us some water.  

I had the Schezuan Beef, which was good and spicy, but I only had a single drink to last me the whole dinner since after our food came out he was MIA.

Even after our food was clearly done with plates stacked it took an additional 15 minutes for him to give us our bill.  I felt like there was no respect for my time and little care for what experience I had.

There are other places to waste your money."}
{"text":"Outstanding!
I had a great day going: wonderful breakfast at my hotel, hung out at the pool for a bit, went to The Little White Wedding Chapel & got married, then to PF Chengs for our \"reception\". 
My brand new wife wanted to go, and although I wasn't crazy about going to a chain restaurant, I don't think we could have topped it! There were 8 of us, only 2 had been to a PFG before. Josh, the waiter made some very helpful suggestions & the food was excellent!!
Josh was probably the best waiter I've ever had. The drinks kept coming & the food was not only perfectly prepared, but timed just right as well. We were all hungry when we got there, and were soon munching on the awesome fried green beans & having the best egg drop soup I've ever had. 

Thank you for such a great experience."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place!!  Like others, I'm strictly gluten free.  Coming here and being able to choose between more than just a couple of items is always a treat for me.  I've never left this place hungry or disappointed.  The GF Shanghai Noodles are unbelievably good...and I love their flourless chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food.

Not a huge fan of Chinese food (or any Asian food - too many vegetables), but I like PF Changs. Their beef dishes are great. The meat is excellent quality and has nice sauce/spice flavor and cooked perfectly - still tender. Very nice atmosphere, good service. 

When someone wants Chineses, I take them here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a family favorite, particularly for take-out. We typically call ahead or order online. Once you start ordering they can save and repeat your previous order, and at pick-up the hostess is very prompt in finishing processing your order and getting your food out to you, ensuring that everything is correct before you walk out of the door.

Some of our favorite dishes are Chang's Spicy Chicken, Shrimp Fried Rice, Egg Drop Soup, Honey Chicken, Spring Rolls, and the Chicken Lettuce Wraps. 

What's that you say? \" Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's basic Chinese.\" Well sure, these are popular Chinese take-out dishes, but P.F. Chang's does a good job of making their food taste fresh and unique. Try it once and you'll definitely see it is not like all other Chinese take out spots.

Their dishes are not overly salty, or greasy, but really, really flavorful. All of the chicken dishes are savory and come in a great portion size. Each entree also comes with a little box rice (white or brown, your choice). Even the egg drop soup is a little different than your average, but just as , if not more delicious. 

If you haven't tried this restaurant or this location, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have heard my mother rave about P.F. Chang's for years and when we wanted a quick dinner after our day of traveling this seemed like a good option. For starters we ordered the Ahi tartare with avocado and the dynamite scallop roll. Then we shared two entrees; chicken pad thai and Chang's spicy chicken. All of our food was delicious and the service was pretty good."}
{"text":"My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. While the dumplings I got were good, the amount of rage I'm feeling toward tonight's dinner service is immense. I ordered the Mongolian beef expecting to enjoy myself and my meal. I came to PF with a larger group but was one of the first people to order, so when I was the last person sitting at the table without any food I was worried. After 10 minutes of waiting I had to ask the waitress where the heck my food was. After a half-hearted apology and more waiting i was given a small plate of food that could never be considered \"family style\" let alone equate to $17. What's worse is that the plate didn't even come with the rice that the menu said would accompany the meal. The beef tasted alright but the meat was very chewy. I would have been better off going to the campus Pei Wei and getting food there. I'd had paid half the price and the food would've been much tastier.
 So between bad service, poor quality of food, and the price, I won't be coming back here voluntarily. (One of the other friend's who was dining with us also had problems, enough so that she had to send her entire meal back and get something else to go.) 
Pro - tip: If you want inexpensive Asian cuisine that tastes amazing, check out Mekong Plaza in Mesa. There are tons of amazing restaurants whose prices aren't going to gut you and the food is worth returning for."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and always an enjoyable visit. They forgot to put in our appetizer order but threw it in for free to make it up to us. A good place to catch a meal if you're down around the waterfront."}
{"text":"Our food was wonderful, as was the service.  A very enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Food was good. Not amazing but good. Service and staff were helpful. Shout out to Austin Wadkins! Best employee there and the reason I'm even reviewing right now! Keep up the good work broski!"}
{"text":"I know it's a chain but it's my first time going to this location.  Sign up for their email program and they email you a coupon for buy one entree and get an entree free.  They have lunch portions Monday-Friday. It's a small restaurant and was definitely busy at lunch time. Not a lot of parking today because the shopping center was busy.  I enjoyed my lunch but overall it wasn't anything special. I had Chang's spicy chicken with fried rice (which cost an extra dollar) and added a side of wontons (2 dollars for 2) I enjoyed the wontons. For once you could actually taste the crab meat. The chicken had a little spice to it but was tasty. Service wasn't bad but our waitress was slow about taking our order and bringing the check.  The food came out in under 7 minutes. It's a nice area to to eat but I prefer other Chinese restaurants in town.  I had the ginger beer and I could not drink it it was so bad. I've had it before and it tastes great but not today. I feel like this place is over priced but I realize it's a chain and that's just their price point. I would like to go back and try some of their soups and possibly the Buddha's feast."}
{"text":"This review is based on the managements excellent  handling of a food issue. We ordered the lettuce wraps (gluten free), which were delicious as usual. Our server was more than a little slow to get to the table (the place was almost empty). Then we ordered the Mongolian Beef. What we received was overly chewy, had no sauce, and tasted old. We spoke with the manager and he had a new plate made fresh (which was much, much better) and he even comped the gf dessert for us. We had the berry ginger shortcake. That was delicious! I could eat that every day. Thank you for your dedication to customer service. We appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Typical chain food.
The To-go order guy was very solicitous and I felt like even though he may have been new, he was driven to get up to speed and work his way up. The bartender was cool, almost too cool, but chitchatted me up about my local sports and was knowledgeable about Vegas gaming.
I ordered the green beans, the hot and sour soup and ahi salad. Honestly, I could have done without all of these items. Super average and overpriced.
But, walking distance from my hotel in 101 degree temps - it was just fine.

Oh and the loudmouth at the bar who appeared to work there, tone it down or take it in the back ;)"}
{"text":"Great service, food and atmosphere. Which PF Chang's is noted for.
Our server was marvelous and they do have a rewards program available."}
{"text":"We went here this afternoon for lunch and I loved everything in this place. This P.F. Chang's has a very cool atmosphere/vibe that fits in with Las Vegas. Our server Deshaun was awesome as he greatly helped us choose what to get from the menu. (Describing it etc). The food wait wasn't that bad either (15 to 20mins) and the food was delicious. I'd easily recommend the Mongolian beef and the Tempura with Vegetables (I'm sure the other items taste delicious as well).  The serving size was also great for us as everything just felt right. I'd easily recommend going here"}
{"text":"Food is good, but nothing really special about it.  I could've gotten the same taste at a Panda Express with better prices.  IMO, food is good, but not good enough to justify their prices."}
{"text":"We stopped here in the early afternoon to get some food to take home and enjoy.   I had heard some raves about this restaurant and my hopes were high.  When we stepped in there was no one there to great us at the carry out desk.   Understandable as it was a bit early and not the main entrance area.   We waited about 10 minutes and someone finally noticed us.  They apologized and took our order.
During our wait we had the opportunity to watch the kitchen staff sort of laze about the kitchen area.  They could start with the pans that were left laying on the floor.  The area looked unkempt.   The restaurant looked dark and uninviting.  It reminded me of being back stage after the production of a high school musical.   Sounds a little weird I guess but that is what came to mind.
The food arrived in ok time and off we went.
Some of the flavors were a little better than what you find at Chinese take out places.  The portions were smaller than we expected.  Nothing that spectacular and nothing to rave about.
May give them a second chance some day but there are many more places to check out before we go back again."}
{"text":"Long story short: Goodyear manager and staff aren't shit. Waited for 40 minutes to be seated only to be left, forgotten, ignored (pick one) another 15 minutes. Three other parties were seated after us and promptly attended to. Only upon leaving to go elsewhere did we receive any attention/response from the half-ass staff and excuse for a manager. They missed out on a huge bill (party of 9) and any future business from my family; but thankfully, Red Robin (right across the street) more than made up for the mistreatment we received at P.F. Chang's. 

p.s. \"Coincidentally?\"...we were the only black patrons. #tryingtoeatwhileblack"}
{"text":"This review may be illegal and all (since it's 3 years too late), but we are talking about Vegas here!! Everything is fair in Vegas and Yelp!!! 

This was the very first PF Chang's I ever went to, so it holds a dear place in my heart.. this was also the time I discovered the amazing food they serve. I didn't even know the name of the restaurant, I just knew what I ate there and what it tasted like. A few years later (maybe one or two) My friend told me he wanted me to try one of his favorite dishes and (hold and behold) it was the same exact thing I ate in Vegas! I believe it was Cantonese Chicken.  So tender, so tasty, so.. so.. ! Well, you get the point.

I remember the experience this way:
It was May or June 2007. We were walking down the strip looking for something to eat. My companion had already been to PF Chang's and told me he really liked the chicken there. The  wait was about 45 minutes (I remember this because I said: I can't wait that long, I'm hungry!). We got a buzzer and walked to the bar at Planet Hollywood. I remember the big strobe light there... I took like 15 pictures of it.  We sat for a bit and before we knew it the buzzer went off. We were taken to the second floor, and what was so great is that we could bring our drinks from the bar with us! We ordered and got our food pretty quickly (I remember this because I believe I was counting the seconds!). I wouldn't say it was an extraordinary experience, but I would say that it was the start of a beautiful, long lasting, loyal and most importantly strong relationship between myself and this fabulous chain! I don't care if people say they are overrated, I love their food, their look, their service, hell.. I love that I can make reservations on-line!! We are in this Together Changy!! =0}"}
{"text":"I had to drop it down to 2 stars.  The food was the same quality, but they do not bring out big bowls of white and brown rice anymore.  They brought out 5 small bowls of rice when there are 7 of us.  Are we suppose to share or have our individual bowls?  

We had our usuals:
2 chicken fried rice - ok
2 mongolian beef - good
2 chicken chow mein - good
2 crispy honey chicken - good
1 orange peel chicken - meh...
1 spicy chicken - too spicy for me, but the group said it was good

Main reason for the 2 stars was the service SUCKED!  We had to literally get our servers attention for anything (refills, more rice, togo boxes, etc.).  We waited 15 mins for our server to pick up the check, he never showed!  So we handed it off to other server and asked if she can help us.  He came back to the table only the times we can grab he attention.  We were always out of drinks.  I have not had that BAD of a service in a long time.  I will not come back on my own, but if the family wants to then they can drag me along (kicking and screaming)."}
{"text":"Parking was confusing.  I saw the place on the corner but where in the heck do I park?  I drove around and found parking in the back (on Ash).  They valid that lot so park there.  

We were greeted right away.  This place is HUGE!  We sat on the side that you can watch Mill Ave.  Pretty cool!  I ordered off the lunch menu:  CRISPY HONEY CHICKEN LUNCH (My favie) with brown rice.  It was ok, not sweet at all?  The egg drop soup was good.  The service from the wait staff was excellent.  I was just very disappointed in the honey chicken this time.  Sorry only 3 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place my and my girlfriend went cause she is allergic to gluten and they have a full gluten-free menu the food was fantastic along with the service and the price is right great date restaurant"}
{"text":"My sister and my son and I went in tonight for just a quiet dinner, we love the sushi and the fried rice. Now my sister is picky and so is my son, now our server Micheal, was one of the best servers we have had. He made my sisters requests happen and even admired my son who loves to make conversation with everyone. His kind heart and just overall tenderness was something that we couldn't ask more of. We live right down the road and will be back to see him! Not many people out there like him and I just want to recognize the food service industry for what it really is. I'm in the food industry and it's a tough job and you have to have the right outlook at it and micheal had that and more tonight so we thank you so very much!!"}
{"text":"Ok - when my friends suggested we order some PF Changs after recovering from weekend shananigance in our hotel my reaction was \"really?? ewww\". I was forced to go to a work thing at PF Chang's in another state and the food was awful - so now you understand my reaction. 

Either way needless to say we ordered some \"chinese food\". We ordered:
- Lemon Grass Prawns with Garlic Noodles: this was YUMMY and the prawns were huge. 
- Chicken Noodle Soup: this was fantastic
- Chicken Chopped Salad + Sesame Vinaigrette: this was a good salad but I think b.c. it was delivery it was not as good as it would have been in the restaurant.
- Crab Wontons: eh - nothing special and not very flavorful
- Chicken Lettuce Wraps: good reviews of this staple item
- Dynamite Shrimp: Good
- Almond & Cashew Chicken: Yummy
- Egg Drop Soup: Good as well

While all items were satisfying and between the four of us (yes all of that for only 4 people) we had crazy left overs. 

The best part about this PF Chang's is probably their customer service. They forgot the sesame dressing for the salad and we were able to convince them to deliver it to the room. To make up for this inconvenience the manager included a piece of their cheesecake and some kind of chocolate amazingness (was it a brownie? chocolate cake? a large chocolate candy situation? No idea). Aside from them being nice enough to bring us the dressing the desserts were out of this world. I'm going to say this and I'm hoping there won't be any backlash from cheesecake connoisseurs BUT this was one of the best, if not THE best cheesecakes I've ever had."}
{"text":"We normally love PF Chang's but this time was a very different feel. As soon as we walked in the host spoke so quietly I could barely hear what he had to said before he asked us again if there were just two of us and what kind of table we wanted. We sat and waited for our server to come. She finally did and quickly asked if we wanted to order and appetizer or order all together. She never introduced herself, gave us any specials, nothing. Nor did she ever smile as well as looking as she had just rolled out of bed. Thought all of the rest of the servers looked like that. 

We got the pork potstickers, side of fried rice and wok fried filet mignon. We were never asked how we wanted our meat cooked. 

We got our appetizer and after eating 2 of them I pulled a hair from one I had just taken a bite out of. Since our server never came back to ask how things were or give us more drinks we had to flag her down. Her response was \"oh. ok.\" And said she would get the manager. A couple of minutes later our food came out and after about ten minutes we had finished our food and waited. It took another ten minutes for the manager to show up when we explained what happened and that we had not had a good dining experience. He said sorry and walked away.

All the manager did was comp the appetizer and tell our server to ask again whether we wanted a free dessert. Needless to say we didn't want anything more from them and just wanted to leave. 

Poor service. Bad food. Poor presentation."}
{"text":"So I don't normally do reviews but I experienced some of the worst customer service at this location that I am astounded.

I had a larger order catered for my company, nothing too big. 4 pans total, $200. I spoke with Calvin that informed me I could pay over the phone if I wanted to since online for some reason didn't have a payment option. As I didn't have the card I indicated that I would call back once I did and he informed me that was fine just to ask to speak with the manager. This was on 12/15/15. On 12/17/15 I called and provided the card number to the manager Amanda and confirmed the details and the pick up for 11:15 am on 12/21/15.

This is where things turned into an absolute nightmare. I arrived and couldn't figure out where to park and pick up the food as I'm new to area so I called and was provided with directions. After finding the garage I was informed that I had to park in the PF Chang's take out spots which were all full. I asked if there was anywhere else I can park and was informed they don't control their parking spots and I would need to find somewhere else to park. A huge majority of this parking structure is reserved parking only mind you. So I drive around a few more times without any luck. I called back and asked if I could have the food brought down to me and I was informed no that wasn't an option. (10-15 minutes) 

After another 10-15 minutes of circling around someone steals a spot in front of me that had just opened up. I quickly asked the lady was she going shopping and she said no to PF Chang for take out. I decided to wait as I wasn't finding any luck and none of the \"Take out\" parking had become available. I waited another 15 minutes and she finally came down low and behold with a PF Chang employee behind her carrying her food!

I finally head into the restaurant to find out that Amanda had not processed the payment for the food and it turns out someone could have bought the food to my car for me as I initially asked. I wasted 45 minutes of my valuable time due to inefficiency on the behalf of their receptionist and in addition missed the entire first half of the meeting I had ordered food for. Calvin handled the checkout and was pleasant. I admit at this point I was so upset that I lashed out at him when it wasn't his fault. The lack of knowledge and customer service I was provided was definitely something I care not to repeat and I will not be having my company return to this place of business for any future catering needs."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here twice from amazon. I love the orange peel chicken with added pineapple and snap peas. Their egg rolls are okay, but a little bit doughy. The spring rolls are the way to go. They tend to forget the extra orange peel sauce though!! I'm addicted to it"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here... 

Their food is good not great but good, I mainly come here for the atmosphere and the good service. 

I've ordered everything from their Orange Chicken to their Broccoli & Beef to their Sesame Chicken and nothing is that spectacular but it's good food. I do like their appetizers such as their Egg Rolls and Crispy Green Beans very delicious. I also like their cocktails they have many to choose from. 

I like to get the Coconut Lemon Sour and the Dragon Martini very tasty. 

Overall I would come here again because I always have fun, it's very sheik and I enjoy the service and decor. 

FYI don't come here if your expecting great Chinese food like I said it's just good!"}
{"text":"I remember the first time I ate at a P.F. Chang, 15+ years ago in Raleigh, NC. I was amazed at the food and I wanted to eat there all the time. As I became a little more discerning and found smaller independent (and more authentic) Asian restaurants, I wanted to eat less and less at P.F. Chang. By the time they opened a Winston-Salem location 3-4 years ago, I had no desire to eat there. For the most part I knew I could find better and fresher Thai food at any number of local places rather than a chain. So when my lunch guest chose this PF Chang to meet for lunch in northern Charlotte, I wasn't really looking forward to it. The staff there changed my mind!

The food is about like I expected- good but not exceptional. I got the lo mein with beef. We also had lettuce wraps as an appetizer. However, the real star here was the service and the hospitality from the staff. I found them to be extremely nice and efficient in everything they did today. Our food came out promptly, and the wait staff did a great job of keeping our glasses filled. They checked on us regularly without being obtrusive. I'd like to give a shout out to the management at this location: well done! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this P.F. Chang to anyone who is considering eating there."}
{"text":"This was amazing! Haven't been to a PF Chang's in quite a while. I surely will be back soon. We enjoyed the crab wontons, Crispy Honey Chicken bowl and Vegetable and Shrimp Tempura Bowl. Everything was very good! Service was excellent too. Happy hour menu starts at 3, lunch menu till 4."}
{"text":"What a disgrace to the chain. I attempt to go there when they first open.  The doors are locked.  They are also dirty with dried saliva on the outside.  So when we are walking away, the man comes and opens the door.  We are greeted by the host who hasn't moved an inch because he is behind his counter with his iPhone in hand and drinking tea or soda....so I ignore that....we are seated outside.  The window that faces the strip had some dried substance that looked like mucus or something...ick!!  So we are moved....then we are looking at the menu prices...I don't wanna pay that much for food when I am surrounded by mucos and saliva with bad service...I picked up and left & probably won't return....shame on you!"}
{"text":"Since I'm Chinese, I can only give the food at PF Chang 4 stars . . . but the day that I came here for lunch, the service was 5 stars if not 6 stars.

The waiter was so professional, so attentive I looked aroudn to make sure I wasn't on candid camera getting punked. 

In fact, the service was so good, when it came time to leave a tip, my hand had a mind of its own and left a 50% tip.

And I left a happy costumer, looking forward to coming back here again and hopefully getting the same waiter!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch since we had lots of time to spare before our flight and we also had an awesome gift card to use. We decided to have lunch here and lucky for us we came in just in time for happy hour.

This restaurant  was not crowded at all. The hosts were very cordial and seated us immediately. For lunch we ordered the orange ginger edamame, the crab wontons, orange peel chicken as our entree and the banana egg rolls for dessert. 

I must say wow! Our food was so fresh and delicious. There is so much attention to detail and the presentation is just beautiful on these dishes. 

Our crab wontons were decorated with what what presumed to be alfalfa sprouts? They were nice and crunchy and I recommend you dip them in the pool of sauce that comes with it.

The orange ginger edamame was also fantastic and the blend of flavors made for  very exiting appetizer.

We shared the orange peel chicken with white rice and it was just the right amount for two (considering we ate appetizers and we also wanted dessert). The orange on the chicken was not overpowering and made for a decadent dish.

If you ever make it to dessert foodie, I highly recommend the banana eggrolls. It is just mind blowing! There are pieces of banana inside an eggroll. This is accompanied by their delicious pineapple icecream and side of fresh berries with mint leaves. This dessert is a delicious blend of flavors and textures. Try a piece of mint leaf with the icecream. It is just absolutely delicious.

The food wasn't the only great thing here. Our waitress was phenomenal. She made our lunch experience so enjoyable. She had such a great disposition and always attentive.

I definitely recommend this restaurant. It's conveniently located near lots of great stores. If you like sharing food I personally enjoy doing the 3 course meal with appetizers, sharing an entree and then sharing a dessert.

Overall a great way to spend our layover. Their Mai Tai will also add a little kick and refresh to your meal. Enjoy! 


Everything was so neatly placed and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Good morning yelp viewers - just a quick update on this establishment. Ordered fried green beans (ok taste), shrimp dumplings ( sauce was terrible), pork dumplings (sent back), fried calamari (served cold and asked to return).  Asked  waiter to request our server to come visit our table - eyes were rolled and he walked off.  Manager came over to assure items would be removed and replaced. The pork dumplings were replaced but management wanted to assure us the smokey flavor is normal. As you can see from the photos both sauces have very different colors and much different taste. The dark color was served first but next order was replaced correctly with rich color and flavor. Huge difference in the before and after foods served. Sad part was while I'm explaining very nicely my concerns, I was quickly hushed and cut off. Managers active listening skills require improvements and I feel sorry for his staff here. Engage with your customer listen and improve don't tell me what I don't enjoy - just listen that's all I ask. LISTEN AND MAKE CHANGES!!!"}
{"text":"P F Chang's in Vegas is the same as P F Chang's in Colorado, or California, or anywhere for that matter ---- and that's just fine by me.

This is the only chain that I like. I'm not a chain food restaurant fan, in fact, I'd rather go hungry then eat in 99% of the chains out there.

P F Chang's, on the other, serves consistently tasty food, as a reasonable price....especially compared to other Vegas fare. What I really like about PFC, is that they don't up-charge simply because they're in a hotel. 
Most do. 
A great example is Starbuck's....try ordering something in a hotel Buck's. Everything is almost $2 higher. 
Not PFC. 
My orange flavored beef was the same price as their franchise back in Denver. 

We only had lunch here, but it was the cheapest, and most filling we had during our Vegas Vacation. Combine that with great service, decent view, my fav wine by the glass.....and you get 4 stars from me. 

Rock on PFC !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service.  As a PF Chang's insider, I've had quite a bit of exposure to various dishes.  Went on the 4th of July, it was slow but got a nice central booth.  Ordered a Asian Pear mojito.  It was balanced and delicious.  I ordered some sushi with scallops.  It was not one of my faves but just getting into various sushi types.  Waitress was wonderful, I ordered King Pao scallops and they were cooked perfectly.  I wish I could cook them like that.  I ordered banana rolls with caramel and pineapple ice cream to go.  She had it packed separately and had ice around the container of ice cream.  Bottom line, I've been here multiple times and both the food and service is consistently great."}
{"text":"And the reason for 5 stars is mainly due to our server Lawrence!!!!  When called in reservation, I said we're a party of 18 ~ Very picky and demanding. We arrived 10 minutes early , our table was ready and waiting for us, and on a very busy day and peak time.... they had assigned the large private dinning room for us. Everything was perfect. The starter plates were great: chicken lettuce wraps, tempura dipped green beans, and veggie egg rolls. Our family style orders were excellent: broccoli beef, lemon chicken, spicy chicken, scallops and bok choy, and combo fried rice along with sticky rice and their infamous brown rice. Thank you for taking care of us. Everyone was pleasant and quick to serve all our needs."}
{"text":"This PF Changs was across from the hotel I was staying at so I thought I would try it out. I was alone so I sat at a table off to the side of the bar. Bad service and OK food was the beginning. I then saw the staff clear glasses from tables and bring them back to the bartender. The bartender had a sink full of soapy water and a sink with just water in it. He would take the glasses 2 or 3 at a time and partially dip them in the soapy water and then partially dip them in the rinse water and then put them in what appeared to be the freezer/cooler. I was disgusted that they were not thoroughly washed and sanitized. I brought this to the attention of the server that didn't seem to care. I then emailed the corp office about it and asked if this was procedure at all locations. I never received a response. I definitely will never go back to that location and doubt I will go back to any PF Changs."}
{"text":"The reason this has any stars is because of the staff. The hostess was a sweetheart and our server was nice as well. The only food item I enjoyed was the dynamite shrimp, which had a lovely crisp and tasty sauce. The other items didn't have much flavor. The worst item we received tho was the kaleidoscope Roll. It was mostly rice rolls of varying sizes and almost none to little of them items described. The flavor was subpar. I suppose that is my mistake ordering a Japanese item at an American Chinese based restaurant."}
{"text":"I would not suggest \"Curbside to Go\". More than once they screwed up my order. Never have I ever received two sauces for my wraps even if I ask for them twice. Your lucky if you get one container half way filled of sauce. I had one employee tell me the lettuce wraps didn't come with sauce nor included the actual lettuce. Never any napkins or customer service. I would be happy if just once they got my order right. For now I learned my lesson."}
{"text":"If you like dogs where you eat, this is the place!  The management will allow all pets to sit at the bar or tables.  Yummy, love to watch a dog eat or **** while I enjoy a Mai Tai!  The manager hid in the kitchen while we waited for him to respond to the pet policy.  Another couple left, and so did we.  

We respect service dogs and have no problem dining with them as they are trained for these locations.  Watching someone hand feed a chihuahua or a boxer while I pay $$ for dinner is not ok.  

So bring your pets here and enjoy a nice dinner and cocktail...with out me."}
{"text":"Meal and services was outstanding our server went out of his way to ensure we had a wonderful lunch experience ."}
{"text":"I have been to P.F. Chang's many times and always had a decent experience but it was never at the top of my list until I enjoyed their Happy Hour menu.  My husband and I have now been quite a few times and have tried many of the items.  My favorite would have to be the well known Chicken Lettuce Wraps. You can never go wrong with those and even better when they are at the cheaper happy hour price.  I enjoy the selection of street tacos that they have to offer, my favorite being the Mahi Mahi tacos.  They are served in twos and actually have two pretty substantial pieces of fish on each.  I was happy to see their Crab Wontons (which actually have a good amount of crab in them-unlike some places)  made it onto the happy hour menu as well. Probably my most notable find was the Coconut Lemon Sour on the cocktail menu. Not too sour, not too sweet and perfect for the hot Vegas summers.  On a non food note, this location added some additional booth seating to the middle of their dining area instead of tables and chairs. My party and I found them be much more comfortable then the previous set up."}
{"text":"Robin was a pleasure today for a quick lunch at the bar. She had our order right out, had my reward points taken care of and a to go cup of our beverages. Great service and food on the strip from a place I trust."}
{"text":"Hit and miss menu options.  Always enjoy the hot sour soup and Kung Pao Scallops and Shrimp.  Edgy atmosphere and cool bathrooms if you have the urge.

Used to be a unique dining experience but now food is predictable and unspectacular."}
{"text":"This is a solid Chang's store. The service is consistent. The food is slightly over priced but consistently good. They did just change the menu and add mini bites as apps. We started with egg drop soup which is a bargain if younger the bowl. I had multi color sushi roll and it was a nice flavor combination. My mom loves the ribs on the appetizer menu and I agree since the bbq sauce is unique. The pad Thai was good with plenty of shrimp. I like it with a bit more sauce. I'm sure my rock star of a server would have made it happen if I asked. Dessert was two raspberry chocolate wontons the were fantastic. 

Sorry the pictures are after I we ate stuff. It smelled and looked good so i got excited."}
{"text":"They were promoting a 20% off take-out special, so we ordered a few dishes to see what the buzz is about.

I have eaten there 1 other time for lunch.  They had a \"seasonal\" chicken curry that was to die for. But, they discontinued it, of course.

Anyway, we ordered the Saigon fresh rolls, which were okay but the sauce made no sense.  They put fresh veggies in there, lemongrass chicken and Thai basil, which I couldnt taste, and peanuts.  Why not serve it with Thai sauces?  They came with a bland creamy sesame sauce that didn't taste like sesame. 

We also ordered egg rolls, which came with a yellow mustard with mayonnaise sauce.  Barf.  I asked for sweet and sour and hot mustard, but got packets.

We also got curried vegetables and added chicken.  Again, the sauce was bland beyond belief and had the color of chinese mustard.  The bok choy was so chewy, I had to spit it out.  I asked for extra spicy, but it was so mild, a 2 year old could eat it.  They did throw in some packets of chili sauce.  I guess that's what extra spicy means to them.

Also, sweet and sour pork.  Sigh.  Strange sauce that was neither sweet, nor sour.

The orange beef, Korean BBQ chicken, and singapore street noodles were okay, but again. Extra spicy meant packets of chili sauce.  How can they charge an average of $15 to $18 per plate?

Our horrible meal cost us $80 and unless they do something great to make me give them another chance, I will not be back.

I don't know whether it was the chef or the restaurant, but OMG!

Why discontinue a great curry dish in favor of this food?  Tsk tsk tsk."}
{"text":"I don't care if it's not \"authentic\" or if it is considered \"the Olive Garden of Chinese restaurants\". I am obsessed with PF Changs.

The thing I love is that you can customize any dish. Brown or white rice, change the sauce, add a vegetable, anything goes. The waiters are so nice about it too. I always change my order and sometimes I feel like the server is annoyed, but never here. My go to dish is the Moo Goo Gai Pan with no sauce, ginger sauce from the Broccoli Ginger Chicken dish on the side, brown rice. 

I even tried it off the gluten free menu just to see if there was a difference and it tasted exactly the same to me. 

The chicken lettuce wraps are great, I haven't met anyone who doesn't like them. I tried the tofu ones too (always trying to be a little healthier). Unless you are veg, don't bother because they have a really weird aftertaste. 

The banana spring rolls for dessert are crazy good. They have fresh berries, coconut ice cream, and a caramel drizzle. Amazing.

The drink specials and appetizer specials they have from 3-6 are a pretty wide variety and priced from $3-$6. A good deal. My brother had a chicken quesadilla from there (odd for Chinese) and as a quesadilla connoisseur, he said  it was among the best he ever had. Pretty impressive, but it does go to show this is definitely not authentic food. I've NEVER heard of an asian cheese and bread dish.

I love the asparagus, but it is a tad spicy. The appetizer shrimp dish is similar to the one at Bonefish Grille, but not as good. 

Overall, when I crave Chinese and my go to takeout place is just not the experience I am looking for, I'll always go here.  Service is always great with the exception of one RUDE waitress who dropped soy sauce covered lettuce into my shopping bag and said \"It's fine.\" Actually it was okay, lucky for that broad.

Sign up for the Warrior Card online and you get 10% off every time you eat there. Very quick and consistently good."}
{"text":"We had take out here and it was very good. We didn't realize there was two separate doors for take out and dine in, so we just proceeded to the front door to the dine in area and asked about ordering take out. The hostess was rude and pointed us to the side take out area and rolled her eyes. It was a busy time of the night but she didn't have to be rude about it. The food was good, prices a little high but all in all it was good."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's used to go above and beyond for it's guests. Without even trying they made each dining experience amazing. It would appear times have changed. Forget going above and beyond, forget even being mediocre, now they are just downright terrible. Service is horrible every time we go to this location. Servers and bartenders seem \"bothered\" to wait on anyone. If you have any type of allergy- definitely stay away from this location. I had two servers, a chef and a manager not able to answer one simple allergy question. I was blown away that they would be so irresponsible with their tabletop ingredients. Just stay away from this location all together, you will only be disappointed."}
{"text":"Thank you to the wonderful (sarcasm) James I did not eat dinner tonight. After waiting an hour because the restaurant was short staffed in the kitchen I finally get my food and it looks like _____! I asked for the manager twice and 10 minutes later he comes to the table and tells me that is Chang Chicken. I eat Chang's Chicken all the time and it was not Chang's Chicken it was some crap they cooked back in the kitchen under the wonderful supervision (sarcasm again) of James. I know why the food sucked and they were disorganized tonight it was because James was leading (sarcasm again) the crew. It will be a while before I revisit this PF Chang's or any PF Chang's. Thank you for screwing up my wives birthday dinner James. Call before you go, if James is managing don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of American Chinese cuisine, but this makes the cut.

Place - hip, Asian fusion venue, that is classy yet hip in a way that gives the place a warm and inviting atmosphere. Definitely a crowd for family/friends outing. Bar is fun for friendly gathering for some sake bombs! Bartender very attentive and awesome!

Service - as mentioned, the bartender was attentive and I would def come back with my girls/guys for some fun drinks. The waiters/waitress was alright -- not bad, above average. They do tend to cater to my needs. On a busy night, it is harder for them. Also when it late towards closing, I don't see them being as attentive long. 

Food - ummm... Ok. I am biased. But being very nice, it is average. They do serve a large portion, and there is a wide selection of entrees! So anyone can find something that they want, whether its seafood, poultry, meat, veggie -- etc!

Yes, as I am such a fan of authentic Chinese restaurant, I'd come back. I like the atmosphere, the location, and the bartendering service!"}
{"text":"Came here for an impromptu dinner with Dad. Naturally, I ordered the lettuce wraps and he got some kinda of beef dish, but we also decided to try dessert this time. We ordered the banana spring rolls, which are deep-fried bananas served with a scoop of either vanilla or pineapple coconut ice cream. Went with the latter and it was SO good! We scarfed the dish down before it even had a chance to cool."}
{"text":"All three time I have been service is sliw or bad. Orders are incorrect. Food is very good. 5 on food 1 on service. Better off to Go to sister restaurant Pei Wei unless you want the ambience of PF."}
{"text":"I went to the PF Chang's in Goodyear over the weekend. I had been craving Asian food and a hot tea after being out in the wet and rainy weather.

We had ordered a pot of tea with our waiter, the Dragon Eye Oolong. We were actually served two separate pots, which was actually a surprise to us. Had we realized the pots would be separate we would have ordered two different types. The tea was incredibly weak and didn't have any really distinct flavor, it was bagged and a disappointment. The tea was cold by my standards, and that's saying a lot because I tend to drink tea at a cooler temperature than most (the tea was cooler than lukewarm). Save the $3.50 per pot and go to Starbucks for a WAY better cup that is hot and only $2.45. 

We shared an appetizer of the Crispy Green Beans, which were incredibly greasy and oily. I ended up tearing off most of the batter on the beans to reduce some of the fat. I think the oil must have been too cold for frying the appetizer, causing so much grease.

We shared the Walnut Shrimp with Melon and the Sesame Chicken. We ordered white and brown rice with the mains. The Walnut Shrimp was ok, but I've had better before - at least the dish was hot.

The Sesame Chicken was not very warm and was lacking in many ways. There wasn't much of a sesame flavor; the most pronounced flavor was excessive salt, like too much soy sauce or teriyaki. There was a good amount of vegetable, but not chicken; I would be surprised if it contained 2oz total for a nearly $15 price tag. The chicken was pounded incredibly thin, coated and fried so much that it tasted more like pork rinds than actual chicken. 

The white rice was fine, but again not the best I have had. The brown rice simply put was disgusting. The brown rice was mushy and overcooked and resembled something closer to oatmeal. The portions of rice were small, about a cup of each. 

The waiter did not come back until we were done the meal, or I would have asked for more white rice. We had the rest of our meal without rice, because the brown rice was just inedible! 

The waiter was ok, but the service was a little chilly like the tea. The visit all and all left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I was recently invited to put an entry into the \"Farm to Wok\" sweepstakes via e-mail. As part of putting in an entry, P.F. Chang was offering a free appetizer. 

My husband and I went to this P.F. Chang as we happened to already be going to Kierland Commons. We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, the avocado lobster sushi roll and the shrimp pad thai.

The best part of the meal surprisingly were the lettuce wraps, I would go back for those any time and maybe even just make a meal out of them. The chicken was plenty seasoned enough and the flavor of the chopped shiitake really came through. There is an extra sauce on the side, which is completely unnecessary (it tasted like a typical asian salad dressing). 

The sushi roll was ok - it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't memorable. I would order another sushi roll from them, but perhaps not this one. I found the lobster just wasn't all that \"lobster-y\". There were no good chunks, it was so thinly flaked it could have been any seafood in there. In my opinion lobster should be the showcase. 

The pad thai simply put was not pad thai. It was a decent asian noodle dish, but surely not pad thai. The \"pad thai\" did not have the iconic bean sprouts, it also had a strong vinegary taste and the sauce was too wet. I'm used to pad thai that is balanced perfectly, and squeezing the lime on top brings the dish to where it should be (in terms of that heat, sweet, sour balance). With a sauce that is too vinegary, there is no need for a lime, in fact there was only one lime piece for a very large dish, as far as I'm concerned it was garnish. 

Our waiter Mike was great, the ambiance was nice, the restaurant was clean. Overall it was a great visit. I'm coming back for the lettuce wraps, and I'm going to go with a different sushi."}
{"text":"I visited a P.F. Chang's for the first time yesterday. We were looking for someplace nice that opened before noon on Sunday when we drove by Kierland Commons, and there it was.

I'm not much into large chains, but at least this one was started in Scottsdale, and the company is headquartered in Scottsdale, so I consider it local.

I've been to Pei Wei several times, but whenever I suggested P.F. Chang's, my husband thought of the downtown Scottsdale location, where parking is a bit of an ordeal. Not so at this north Scottsdale location.

A hostess opened the door as we arrived, and we were seated immediately. Service was excellent throughout the meal. I ordered the Buddah's Delight (Vegetable medley with five-spice tofu served steamed or stir-fried, $7.95). My husband ordered the same thing as a Lunch Bowl with Egg-Drop Soup. I wasn't sure if the hot and sour soup was vegan, so I passed on the soup. His \"lunch bowl\" portion was smaller than my entree portion, so we switched. The vegetables were perfect--broccoli, snow peas, green beans, carrots. The tofu was the same style as that at Pei Wei. I don't know how they prepare it, but it's delicious. We both had brown rice.

Our entire check, with iced tea that was never empty, was around $22--an excellent bargain for a good vegan meal in a nice atmosphere with great service."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a whim and we were glad we did. We started off with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps and the Steamed Pork Dumplings. The chicken lettuce wraps were awesome. The iceberg lettuce they served with it was cold and crispy and held the steaming chicken mixture perfectly. They were like little tiny lettuce cups that were specifically made for this very reason. And then once you poured a little bit of the sauce in it was like heaven in my mouth! I was really looking forward to the steamed dumplings as it seems as if you can't get them hardly any more. Almost every place wants to fry them nowadays instead of simply serving them steamed. However these turned out to be cold. Not cold enough to send back but just lukewarm and enough so that the flavor just didn't pop. Somewhat disappointing. When our entrées arrived we tore ourselves away from the lettuce wraps to dig into those. I ordered the Salt-and-Pepper Prawns with a side of Lo Mein. I really enjoyed the flavor of the salt-and-pepper on the prawns and liked the fact that the breading was not too thick. I did not care much for the sauce they served with it. I'm not sure what it was but it had a vinegary taste to it. Hubby didn't care much for it either. He had the Mongolian Beef with brown rice. Unfortunately the first batch they sent out was way overcooked to the point of burnt and crispy and we had to send it back. They quickly brought us another one and it was much better. The beef was very tender and many of the green onions were still crisp which I really liked. Although we were both full and couldn't finish our meals we decided to order chocolate martinis for dessert. They were scrumptious and pretty potent! So all in all a good meal and we will definitely be back as we finally accrued enough points on our rewards card for a free entrée next time! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food served with dangerously high sodium and carb counts.  There is a nutrition count menu posted online.  The only question to be asked is why anyone would risk life by eating the food?  In some cases the sodium count is 2-3 times the DAILY recommended limit.  My lunch group lunched there today and I found the only items which had reasonable counts.  The portion was minuscule and not good.  That's how the count came in low.
Why risk your life eating here?  It's like suicide by sodium!"}
{"text":"It seems to be normal for the blond female bartender to completely ignore customers standing at the end of her bar waiting for takeout. She hasn't acknowledged me with so much as a \"hi\" much less a \"someone will be right with you\" on 2 separate occasions even while walking right past me. Apparently P. F. Changs doesn't realize that we don't know who's job it is to do takeout only that we are being ignored by an employee. The bartender also doesn't seem to realize that we are potential future customers at her bar (I will never sit there). The gal who IS responsible for takeout is quite helpful and pleasant. It's a shame all the employees can't take some lessons from her on customer service. Even after speaking with the manager who apologized and said she would address the issue, I left with a bitter taste in my mouth after spending almost $70 on takeout food in the last couple weeks."}

Then I receive the Mongolian beef what the hell is going on had to send it all back asked for the manager she took forever to come to my table for one thing she really needs a lesson in customer service!

Located less than a mile from Gammage Auditorium, it is easy walking distance from the Gammage parking lot.  

Reservations on show nights are highly recommended, and let them know you are seeing a show. A special card will be left on your table alerting the staff to be quicker than usual.    

Season ticket holders receive a free appetizer, while single show ticket holders receive 10 percent discounts.  

The food and service as mentioned in most reviews is solid. My only qualm is the use pf sauces can be cut on half and not compromise any of the dishes."}

I  formally thank Philip Chiang for entering the culinary world with his mother's authentic recipes as inspiration and restaurateur Paul Fleming in creating this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The Tempe PF Chang's has always been known for poor food. We've eaten at many other locations in both CA and AZ. We have compared the various dishes and the service at other locations, and last night confirmed our worst fears about this location. Let's be clear, I'm only reviewing the Tempe location. Our waiter seemed odd from the beginning. We were seated in a very empty restaurant. Maybe 10 guests in the whole place. Yet our waiter didn't introduce himself, or ask for our drink order. Instead giving us a quick hello, and telling us he'll be back later for our drinks. After ordering drinks, our server returned 6-8 minutes later saying the \"bar is slammed, and please be patient.\" Note: The restaurant and bar were fairly empty, and we only ordered 3 beers and a wine. Our server finally took our appetizer order. We ordered lettuce wraps. Having ordered this over a dozen times, I know the look and taste. The white gelatin noodles weren't fully cooked and hard, and server didn't ask to mix the sauce to our preference. BUT when a bug crawled out from the lettuce we almost screamed. It was crawling around while a tried to flag down a waiter (or anyone) to witness the bug. Another waiter came over, and saw the bug and whisked the dish away. When our server finally appeared, we told him of the bug. He replied, \"Was the bug big or small?\" Hug??? We decided enough is enough. When the bill arrived, the lettuce wraps were still on our check. We questioned this, and our weird waiter said he wasn't authorized to remove the cost. \"Well, find the manager then!\" The bug infested appetizer was eventually taken off our bill, but the manager never stopped by to smooth things over. There's plenty of great dining options in Tempe, so don't eat here."}
{"text":"What this place really has going for it is the customer service.  The waitstaff is top notch.  This particular location has a nice, intimate feel to it, though, that does vary from location to location.  We dined at the PF Chang's in Denver a couple of years ago, and it was loud, crowded, and flooded with way too much natural light effectively killing the ambience.  

Anyway, the food here is good, not crazy good.  You probably aren't going to run through the streets screaming about yer love for the PF Chang.  However, I'm a fan of the double pan fried noodles, and I could eat those until I explode.    

I'd say this is a good place for a cozy dinner with a fine lady.  Hubba hubba.  Not that I did that.  I went here with a kid and a grouchy old man!  By the time we were ready to leave the provided chopsticks were being used inappropriately, and the kid was making herp derp faces at the old man and pissing him off.    

I tipped big to ease the waitstaffs suffering.    

Werd."}

{"text":"It's Saturday night, 10:30pm, we just got out of a show and we're totally hungry and utterly dehydrated.  Both of these facts make perfect sense.  We're hungry since we haven't eaten in the last 12 hours.  We're extremely dehydrated because all we've ingested over the same 12 hours are cocktails, martinis, ketel one with diet rockstar, basically all kinds of chemicals that make you feel drunk and/or wired, but most certainly do not replenish the water content of your body at the cellular level.   Since we're staying at the Aladdin, we decide to eat at P.F. Chang's as it's convenient and always good.

The wait for a table is 45 minutes so we opt to eat at the bar instead.  The bartender, Peter, and his assistant both totally rock and do a stellar job with impeccable service.  We start with drinks as I get yet another martini and my wife gets a pear mojito.  Before I ingest a drop of alcohol, though, I ask for a glass of ice water.  I then proceed to drink 7 glasses of water within the next 10 minutes before even touching my martini.  Clearly my basic bodily function have decided that my brain is too fucked up to make the right choice and the cells in my body decide that they need to unite against this tyrant who keeps feeding them alcohol instead of pure and rejuvenating water.   Thankfully, I'm not that stupid that I would fight such a primal urge, so I drink glass after glass after glass of H2O.   Although I get a quizzical look from the assistant behind the bar, she's happy to oblige and brings me glass after glass as fast as I drink them.

We got the crab wontons and the Peking potstickers as appetizers.  I then had the Dan Dan Noodles and my wife had the crispy orange beef.   The best, said she, crispy orange beef she has ever had the pleasure to eat at P.F. Chang's.   Now we've been to Woodland Hills, San Diego, Thousand Oaks, Walnut Creek, and Emeryville locations, so we're not newbies.   Still, by far, she said this dish shined far above any other she has ever had.  

I had the Dan Dan noodles, which were quite good and had a good spicy kick to 'em.   I gotta say though that after the 8 or 9 glasses of water that I drank and the crab wontons that I chomped on, I wasn't all that hungry at that point.  My eyes glazed over which typically means that I'll be snoring away within the next 15 minutes.   We took this as our cue to head back to the room for some well deserved sleep."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I do like PF Changs, it's just that it is a chain restaurant and usually you don't get unforgettable with that.  I love the atmosphere and decor and we always get good service. 

We ordered as a group and just passed the plates around to share.  Appetizers: crab wontons, lettuce wraps, ribs.  Out of all of these I say lettuce wraps all the way!  Main Entrees:  honey chicken, sweet and sour chicken, sesame chicken, Pepper beef, beef and broccoli, honey crisply shrimp, noodles, fried rice.   I would say all were yummy but I didn't care much for the sesame chicken.  They honey crispy shrimp was wonderful. 

Overall we will always go to PF Changs since the family likes it.  It's good chain food type of Chinese."}
{"text":"Service service service! I can't say it enough that the staff really went out of their way to take care of us. The food speaks for itself but the service was great! Sweet and sour chicken was fantastic but needed some spice and they supplied it very quickly! Servers are very nice as well as the waiters. They got us in right away. Place was also very nice and clean. Thank you team"}
{"text":"*Warning*
On Sept 24 my cousin her young son and I had dinner at PF Changs in Goodyear. To my surprise there was a screw, yes a Screw in my food! The manager Johnny Dang apologized and said the screw fell off a steamer pot. Took my name, number and email address. He did pay for our meals that we obviously didn't finish!! It has now been over a week and I have not received a follow up call from the manager or anyone else representing PF Changs. I emailed the operating partner of the establishment to notify her of my experience and emailed customer service. Still NO response !!! Very Poor customer service!!
Please very cautious if you eat there !"}
{"text":"Lunch. Spicy Green Beans, Pot Stickers, Egg Drop Soup, and Spicy Chicken. All very good with great service.?

I've been to several locations for both lunch and dinner, and have yet to be anything but please with the votes and the service."}
{"text":"We go here everytime we're in Vegas with our kids...sometimes when they're not with us.  PF Changs does a great job with Gluten free and my daughter loves their food.  This is one of those places where she doesn't feel like she's missing out on anything.  GF Mongolian Beef, GF fried rice, and GF chocolate dome dessert and she is in absolute heaven.  And nobody else at the table can tell the difference, so it ends up being a great night/afternoon out.

The food is great whether you need Gluten Free or not, but if you do need gluten free food, this is a must go place.  They pay very close attention to cross contamination and go out of their way to make sure your eating experience is safe...and delicious."}
{"text":"We haven't been to PF Chang's in a while. Don't know why. We always have a good dining experience. Lawrence was our server. He was very helpful. We were trying to figure out an ingredient in the asparagus side dish and he went to the kitchen and found out for us. Our meal was so good that we ordered a pad Thai to go for later."}
{"text":"6/18/2018   Stopped in the Paradise Rd. location for lunch with family.  There was ample parking and the restaurant was not busy and we were immediately seated and our drinks and orders for appetizers were taken.  We were waiting for another couple to arrive and our order for lettuce wraps arrived with drinks.  I held off on trying the \"wraps\" but my brother and his wife said they were so good that they ordered another order when my sister and her husband arrived.  We ordered Chicken Kung Pao, Shrimp Fried Rice, Crispy Honey Chicken Bowl, Sushi, and Hot and Sour Soup.  Everything was good except I thought it took a little longer for the food to arrive than it should have, especially since the place wasn't that busy.  The lady that was our server was friendly and did a good job on checking to see if we needed anything several times.  We enjoyed our food and I would eat at this location again.  I would recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I used to love pf chang's but It's not like it used to,  the food is bland, I ordered lobster and crab fried rice and long noodle with shrimp , all fried I didn't like it pls make it great again"}
{"text":"Our experience about that restaurant. we had a dinner last night. Our server named Michael he was terrific know exactly what you need and what you want we had an excellent food taste such a good experience.
Our server ( Michael ) was smiling all the time we have been there .
We enjoyed very much his company we do recommend that place to anyone good Chinese food taste different than others restaurants thank you so much we enjoyed our time."}
{"text":"My husband can't eat rice so he asked what other side he could get with his entree.   I was told we could get steamed veggies for an up-charge.  Ok, sounds reasonable.  He brought us a little plate of steamed snow peas, broccoli and carrots.  When the bill came, we were charged $3.95 for the \"Baby Buddha's Feast\" (from the child's menu) which actually comes with a child's drink and side.  Did I mention my picky 2-year-old child was with us but chose to eat nothing.  Point is- if I am going to pay for a child's meal, I expect to be offered what comes with the price of that meal.  My toddler would've enjoyed the child's drink and side, that is had we been offered this option.  Our server was not looking out for us!  Disappointed."}
{"text":"I invite my brother and sister in law (first time) last night after church for dinner and we are disappointed about the food, we order wonton soup and they served very cold and the Mongolian beef become Mongolian green onion. When they bring the food after 30-40 Ins wait they served cold not even warm. service very slow. This place not recommended to everyone."}
{"text":"Never been dissapointed at a P F Chang! Don't miss the chicken lettuce wraps. Love the Mongolian Beef. Always fresh and fast service although you may wait sometime without reservations. Mini desserts are great."}
{"text":"Took my son and family here for dinner. It was so bad I don't think I will ever go back. What happened to the PF Changs of just a few years ago. This place has gone WAY down hill. The funny thing is my husband was on business in Philadelphia and ate at a PF Changs there and he agrees with me how bad it is lately. Went from one of our favorite restaurants to probably never again. My son ordered a chicken dish and I ordered the pad Thai. Both dishes the chicken was so tough you couldn't eat it. No flavor."}
{"text":"The PF Changs here in Las Vegas is one of the better ones. You would think they would all be the same but they are not.  Very good food. A little pricey perhaps for some but if my husband likes it you know it's great. Pot stickers steamed for an appetizer and shrimp for dinner. Excellent."}
{"text":"Love PF Changs food! This location in particular has AWESOME servers, always very friendly and on top of it.  The reason I took away a star is because the hosts are rude and act like they are on a power trip. I get they're busy, but it wouldn't hurt to smile. Every time I call to see what the wait is like, they act like i am asking for something insane and put me on hold for a couple min.  Never experienced that at any other establishment"}
{"text":"The service we received from Michael wax exceptional. He was very knowledgeable, personable and attentive.!"}
{"text":"We ordered the meal for curbside pickup while we were in a hotel in Vegas with out 4 month old daughter.  Takeout is much easier when you have a little one.  To our surprise, when we got back to our hotel, I noticed that they had forgotten plates, napkins, utensils, and all of the dressings that we requested when we made our online order.  

Normally, this would not be an issue, but being in a hotel and not realizing this until we got back complicated things tremendously.  That being said, it's not the mistakes you make but how you handle them, and when I called the restaurant to explain our predicament they went above and beyond to make it right.  I wasn't about to drive back to the restaurant, so they offered to refund part of the order via a gift card sent to our house.  As I said, above and beyond.  The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of the original mixup.

The food was excellent.

{"text":"Love the happy hour here , and the atmosphere is great. The hot and sour soup is pretty good here too. Chicken lettuce wraps are awesome"}
{"text":"It was good. there were 7 of us. We ordered a table full of items and shared. Excellent lettuce wraps, egg rolls, etc. All in all it was consistent with P.F. Chang's."}
{"text":"I have always loved PF Chang's and have prided myself in going tp PF Chang's across the country. The service and food have have always been good except for my last visit to the Homestead restaurant.  The service was ok, but the food was terrible. In fact, I had remnants of another entre in my meal. I gave PF Chang's the benefit of notifying the manager via email, but after 3 weeks with no response this is an example of the poor service. I never received a response from the manager. This is by far the worst PF Chang's that I have visited."}
{"text":"Quality is not always consistent. Mongolian beef for example is too sweet some times. But overall great place and I keep coming back"}
{"text":"This was my very first experience with this chain. I was blown away. I suffer from a gluten intolerance and was surprised to find that they have a dedicated menu of gluten free dishes and appetizers. This made my day...the food was delicious and you couldn't tell that it was gluten free. I had a great time with my lunch companion, being able to eat as freely as she does. Thank you PF Changs for taking on this unfortunate and debilitating disease and allowing us to enjoy all that your establishment has to offer. I will be returning, and I hope my  review will allow others with a gluten intolerance or allergy to enjoy going out to eat Asian cuisine again."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in the area.  I have been for lunch and dinner numerous times and if they served breakfast I'd be there too.  Service is great and the food is awesome.  The place is insanely packed most nights of the week so make reservations, do take out or be prepared to wait.  I ordered take out once and they actually gave my order to someone else.  The hostess figure it out, notified me, apologized profusely and the manager comped me about 50% of the bill and had new food in record time.  All without my asking for anything to be done - these people get service and how to deliver it!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! The Lettuce Wraps, Mongolian beef dish and Mai Tai drinks are all so good!! Service was very friendly and quick. It's a very nice restaurant especially for a nice family dinner."}
{"text":"This place is always good, and when you are in Vegas and want a \"cheaper\" option, this will do! There was a bit of a wait, but that's was ok with us, we just sat and gambled a bit! Once we got a seat, we were sat outside, which was so nice and warm out, BUT we were literally sat behind a big column thing, which blocked us from all views of the other patrons and it was VERY dark there! We asked for more candles or if we could be moved somewhere else, the staff tried to be accommodating but since the restaurant was really full...they couldn't move us, but gave us 2 candles...oh well..we were too hungry to care that much. They food was great, I ordered the schizuan (sp?) scallops...soo good and spicy!!! Yum!!! My sister had the beef with scallions? I seriously think there was maybe 7 pieces of steak, tiny pieces, and a bagillion scallions!! My sister was not too happy. They also forgot her order of calamari..."}
{"text":"We usually get takeout from here, we don't usually dine in.  Food is always fresh and hot, plus they have a great gluten free menu. When we pick up the food, the employees are always friendly and cheerful.  The rewards system is awesome...fairly easy to earn free entrees!"}

{"text":"This is my 3rd time to this location. Our server was Matthew and he was promt and very informative! He was always giving us refills, which is a huge plus in my book! So the service was awesome! For food, we shared the spicy chicken, that was awesome and the honey shrimp, which was also awesome! And you can't forget the fried rice, I'm addicted to that stuff, and they make it perfect! All in all, this place is awesome an WILL be coming back!"}

{"text":"I liked the gluten free spicy chicken.  It's the perfect portion for lunch."}
{"text":"I had the worst waitress here tonight, Narmeen!! It all starts with the eye roll, scoff, and storming off when asked if we could have a few moments to look at the menu. I made the mistake to ask about the sauce for their lettuce wraps and get told with attitude \"we don't mix that at the table anymore and haven't for a while now\", and I, the customer, tell her \"oh sorry, my mistake\", out of habbit from being a person who was taught to have good manners and treat people respectfully. Narmeen treats you like you are the most negative aspect of her job. I observed her treat other customers the same, so at least my family of four wasn't singled out. Don't ask her for anything or expect her to hold up to her obligations, like water refills. After having enough of her negativity, I call her out for having a bad attitude and being rude, and she raised her voice and says \"I am not!\", to which I said yes you have and in fact can you send your manager over. More attitude and scoffs and no manager shows, yet she can flutter about telling her co-workers about me calling her out. I finally stop the hostess and say, please send the manager over. Kelvin comes by and I explain how upset I am with Narmeen and say I have no interest in being a repeat customer. He did say he was sorry and did discount the ticket. I told him I'd fire her if she was my employee. Long story short, I won't go back and if you do and get Narmeen, best of luck to you. She is simply mean. My former review here was 5 stars. Narmeen, you killed it for your store."}
{"text":"I ordered egg drop soup and lo mein with chicken. It was really good, delicious and huge. The only thing that I missed was the plastic silverware or chopsticks."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant chain. 

First time trying this location in Pittsburgh area and it did not disappoint. 

Very friendly staff and restaurant very large with both a bar side and a restaurant side. 

Menu has changed recently and pricing is creeping up but the freshness and quality remains!

Crispy greens is a must have for appetizer as is the egg drop soup!

Dinner go with the beef and broccoli (sauce is out of this world!)

We tried the salt & pepper shrimp and it was crispy and delicious. 

Overall if you enjoy westernize Chinese food this is a fantastic choice!"}
{"text":"It's PF Chang's what could possibly be wrong right? Well, thank goodness for this location, nothing.

Located conveniently on the strip, this PF Chang's is easy to find and easy to go to.  So beware the crowds and the potential long wait if you go during peak eating hours.

The staff is usually friendly, as the people who may eventually annoy are  customers as well.

If I can offer you one word of great advice for this location (not sure if they do it in another locations), order from the lunch plates...and go before 4pm.  The lunch plates offer you individual servings of varying dishes and come included with rice and either egg drop or sweet and sour soup.  You can easily have an entree, 2 drinks (non-alcoholic), and 2 of these lunch plates for $40 total.  Not bad considering the potential bill when dining family style and after 4pm."}
{"text":"We recently chose this restaurant to celebrate a birthday. My wife had a lobster fried rice dish which was heavily breaded and apparently tasted more breaded than seafood. I had a chicken breast dish off the lunch menu which was also breaded. I could have gotten a dish like mine at a strip mall hole-in-the-wall Asian style restaurant. There was a choice of soup or salad. My salad was a nice size and not bad. The soup was ordered by three others, and it was egg drop soup. Egg drop soup is not rocket science. The soup was so bad nobody would eat it. It tasted like nothing. I tried to eat some of it. The service was adequate. We hadn't been there in a few years but it used to be fairly busy. It was almost empty. Sadly, Pei Wei, which is a lower tier restaurant owned by the same people is better. We won't be returning,"}
{"text":"Last night we went to P.F. Chang for dinner.  The place looks very nice and we did not have to wait for a table.  We got the 39.99 Four-Course dinner which was very reasonable.  I had a Newcastle draft to start and my wife had a glass of white zin.  Then we had Hot & Sour soup and a lettuce wrap with chicken.  The soup was a small serving and not spicy,  the lettuce wrap was very good and a nice size portion.  Both the Seasame Chicken and Kung Pao Shrimp were good, but could have more spice.  The mini desserts served in shooter glasses were excellent.  I had the Apple Pie and my wife had Lemon Tres Leche, which I tasted.  We will be coming back and will try their Happy Hour next time."}
{"text":"PF Chang's is a Chinese fusión chain restaurant. I've visited others in 5 other cities and they always deliver quality food.
Here in Vegas I saw two. This one on the strip in the Planet Hollywood, and then another about a block east of the strip south of Flamingo.
The service was excellent.
The food was delicious.
And The prices were consistent with other PF Chang's.
I strongly recommend dropping in here, especially if you've never had it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for me, I wasn't hungry enough for a full meal when my freind and I had our first chance to eat at a P. F. Chang's. A chinese food aficionado, she rated the Lobster & Shrimp Rice as very good. I enjoyed their  
Strawberry Cucumber Limeade and crispy Vegetable Spring Rolls. The service was attentive if a little pretentious and the wall murals were worth a good look."}
{"text":"I'm a long time PF Chang's fan, and the Northlake location is one of their best. The staff here has always treated me with courtesy and respect.

Tonight my boyfriend and I weren't feeling cooking and headed out! We were hoping to sit outside, but the tables are sparse on this patio, and the chairs are kind of wide and couch like, so ultimately we headed inside. It was great. We had an awesome meal of our favorites (chicken lettuce wraps, mongolian beef) and I tried one of the newer items. It was the Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl. It was so flavorful and lite. I loved every bite. 

Special shout out to our server Neal who gave us some tips and locked our app in the POS in time for happy hour pricing (3pm-6pm)! Thanks man!"}
{"text":"I do not like P.F. Chang's. Maybe it's the excitement of being on vacation, or the free booze from the casinos, or a mix of the two. But this location is awesome. Love the scallops and fried rice with shrimp here. Nice and spicy on the scallops. The interior is great too. Most PF Chang's feel too large and cavernous. This one feels 'just right.' Service is great here too. They have a huge wait staff and are very attentive. They totally messed up drink order once, and just gave us a bunch of free drinks. It says a lot about the management, if you ask me, to have a stand out restaurant from such a lousy chain. Their prices are ok. Kinda steep, but welcome to Vegas, right? The wait times can be absolutely a turn off. We were told one day it was about 90 minutes. Next! But if you get there right when they open and eat dinner at a senior citizen time, you're in luck. A surprisingly decent place, very unexpected. I wouldn't visit it in my home area, but here, not bad!"}
{"text":"This place has an awesome happy hour 7 days a week...which is not so easy to find in Vegas. And, on top of that, the food is really good. Pork dumplings and crab wontons were yummy! If you are staying in Planet Hollywood like we were than it is even better!"}
{"text":"Inside of the Kierland Commons shopping area across from the Scottsdale Quarter, this location has a lot to offer other than just good eats. We went in at an off time (3 p.m.) since we had done an early breakfast and skipped lunch while running around. 

We were able to sit outside on their newly added porch - which was really nice. Our server was very sweet and attentive.  We ordered the pot stickers (steamed pork), shared the crispy orange chicken entree, and had the great wall chocolate cake slice for dessert!  Everything was delicious as usual and came out pretty quickly.

Overall: A
Great new porch addition with a good vibe and decor is well done - there are heater units for a cooler day, if you still want to eat outside.  Standard good service and food!"}
{"text":"Four stars because the service is usually very good and food has never been a problem. Some visits are off. A few times it has taken awhile for staff to notice a group of us standing at the door waiting to be sat. Yesterday evening we were sat at a table and a waiter from a different section had to come over and \"take us\" since he was not sure who our original waiter was.

As I said before, won't be 3 stars because it's usually a great experience but lacking a star due to several issues with service."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving PF Changs a 2 star is because of their egg drop soup. It was the only good thing my hubby and I ate. My husband ordered the Beef with Broccoli and said it was WAY too salty. I was excited to finally find a place that did lemon chicken the way I like it, but the lemon sauce was absolutely overpowering! The lemon sauce shouldn't be the only thing I taste, it should only enhance the taste of the chicken and broccoli. My husband and I didn't feel well after eating here, and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I come here for their poke bowl. The first time I had it, omgggg it was amazing! (Remember to ask for wasabi and ginger) Came back to try it for the second time, it wasn't as good, there was a smell to it. Also tried their Mongolian beef, it was too salty. The hostess was very nice and friendly, & our server was very attentive. I don't think you can get bad service here, they just need to make their food less salty. Overall it was an okay experience!"}
{"text":"all in all a horrible experience they messed up my daughters meal manage to include a completely burnt fried egg inside of chicken fried rice just poorly mismanaged version of this restaurant I expect it be shut down soon too horrible horrible example of PF Chang they should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Great as usual service was outstanding, a bit loud and especially the table across from us. The stand out was the dessert Banana spring Roll with Coconut-Pineapple ice cream. Smack your MoMa good."}
{"text":"OK, so the atmosphere is nice and the service is good, but the whole experience is lacking.

Chinese food should not be 90% protein. If that's your gig, by all means, hit the Chang's. I, however, love vegetables and expect a goodly amount of them in my Chinese dishes.

So, PF Chang's not among my list of acceptable places to spend my money. Unfortunately, my wife likes it. But, I can usually get by with some Lettuce Wraps.

This go 'round our server was Dominic. He was pretty damn awesome. My only critique is that he did not offer to tailor the Lettuce Wraps sauce. I have come to expect that and totally forgot to ask when the wraps arrived. Anyway, the wraps were bland as a result. 

Everything else was bland as well with SPARSE veggies. And believe me I have tried to request add-in veggies in the past. It cost an additional $5.95 for the reinforced disappointment. Even the Hot and Sour soup was iffy. Weak ass Chili oil and chili paste employed to ZERO effect. Lordy!

Like I said PF Chang's take on Chinese is not for me... your mileage may vary.

Dominic is awesome though. 5 Stars to him and his suave, expert service ... negative 3 Stars for stingy veggie game and lack luster flavor."}
{"text":"OK, I don't want to hear that PF Chang's is not authentic Chinese.....everybody knows that.  The family enjoys coming here.  It's been a while for us, so we decided to have a family night out.

We ordered the Tofu Lettuce Wraps and Crispy Green Beans to get the night started.  Both were awesome as usual.  One thing about PFC is that they rarely screw up the appetizers.....I can always count on a solid appetizer.

Their entrees however are going downhill.  One of my favorite dishes is the Dali Chicken, which is their spiciest Chicken dish.  When it came out, it looked dry and tough.....and it was.  You can almost see how dry it is from the picture I took.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw?select=vefoPIx8FPxegrVmSyeWmg
Damn.....why can't they keep up the consistent quality like they do with their appetizers?!  I also don't like how they only give you a small bowl of Rice.....I have to ask for a 2nd bowl as soon as it's delivered to the table, otherwise I won't get my 2nd bowl before I'm done with my entree.

Overall, it was a nice dinner with the fam.....everyone enjoyed their meal and although mine wasn't perfect, I wasn't going to let it ruin a nice night out.

We like the unique flavor of PF Changs, but it's not on our regular rotation of restaurants anymore.  We only come by when we get the urge to have one of their signature dishes like the Dali Chicken or Tofu Lettuce Wraps.  The food tastes the same, but I think they've cut down on their portion size over the past few years while keeping prices the same.....sneaky.  For instance, with the Lettuce Wraps, we only got 3 small Lettuce leaves with the order.  In the past, we'd get 1/2 a head of Lettuce with large leaves.  Also, I remember when we would be able to share entrees and eat family style.  Now, it's not really possible.

The service here is hit & miss.  The last visit, we had to waive down our server for everything.....refill water glasses, order more Wine, WTH?!  However, the 2 visits before that our server was attentive.

{"text":"If I felt like getting berated by an overweight middle-aged sweaty restaurant manager, I would have went to Golden Corral. Instead I went to PF Changs in the South Park area, where I would've expected let's just say a different experience. Our server was weeded, which I understood from being a server for a decade in my past life. When our food finally arrived I needed a simple side of potsticker sauce. I asked five different associates to no avail, I honestly felt like I was asking them for their first born child or possibly an algebraic equation. Even asked the host which was a little twit, he was smirking and being condescending like seating people is something to be arrogant about. I inevitably gave up on my sauce told the server to put our entrées in a to go box and asked for the check. I told my server I was not interested in speaking to a manager sometimes there's no resolve as I had already explained myself multiple times and was beyond frustrated. But nonetheless here comes Todd. Covered in sweat, rolling his eyes, borderline belittling me as I again told him the deal. Now I can certainly empathize with it being Mother's day, a day that tends to be more crowded in nature but I wasn't off-put by the slow service but the lack of situational awareness. How could 6 people still not have a ramekin of sauce on our table? Todd's attitude was unwelcoming, rude and beyond off putting. I honestly laughed at him and asked him to leave our table. His lack of professionalism & self awareness was shocking. Basically the place is a joke, used to be a well oiled machine. I don't know why am surprised when the sole point of failure or success rides in the hands of Todd."}
{"text":"I thought that I did not like PF Chang\"s food but I am I  looking for new places to eat and so I went to PF Chang's on Paradise.  I have eaten there 4 times including tonight and each night has been excellent.  As a \"local\" i do not really like loud crowded places which is what I find at most of the Casino restaurants. So this place with self parking on Paradise and Flamingo is easy in and out.

This dining room is full of booths and  has a glass wall that looks out onto trees and a view of the strip. Apparently they rely on convention business because the nights I have been  there it has been  very quiet, good for me but maybe not so much for the business. However, it made me very happy that I was there.  

My server tonight was Tiffany and I give her a big shout out. We got into a very interesting conversation about the food and its origins. She was helpful and really seemed to want to be there and create a good customer experience. 

I had the combination fried rice and the shrimp with lobster sauce. Both were excellent by any standard.  They have a 1.5 glass of wine for a fair price.  I don't know what else to look for in a restaurant. I had a great time.  

I have decided it is too hard to hold out a 5 star rating for something that is divine. Rather, I am now giving 5 stars to any restaurant at any level as long as I had a really nice total experience."}
{"text":"I love PF Changs. I'd love it even if it hadn't been referred to in a jokingly mocking type of way in the second installment of The Hangover (when Gallifanakkis's character asks if the Buddist Temple is a PF Changs), but a bit of verbal product placement never hurt anyone. 

I was in Vegas for a friends wedding and was the first of our crew to arrive, so I went walking. I didn't want to ruin the strip for myself quite yet, so I wandered down off the beaten path and found this PF Changs. 

I was seated immediately by a friendly and talkative blonde waitress. When I told her I had just arrived in town from Toronto she informed me that she'd never been to Toronto or Canada for that matter and was a Las Vegas local. I thought the experience just have been unique for both sides of the street as she'd never been to Toronto and I had never been to Vegas. As I was there, I considered myself up 1-0.  

I ordered beef and steamed veggies, and a side of their egg rolls. If you've never tried them, they're really good. Especially given how this is a corporate venture and not a mom and pop restaurant, I wouldn't have expected much but they're very surprising. Along with three very fairly priced Bud Lights (it is Sin City after all!), my bill came up to be a very reasonable $24!

Worth the trip. Just tell them Zack sent you"}
{"text":"Went there for friend's birthday.  Attentive wait staff took our order promptly but soon returned to say they were out of the salmon I ordered.  To my surprise they then comp'd the entire meal for both of us \"for our inconvenience\".

{"text":"This is a very busy location, but were super every time we went!  Gluten free done right at this location.  For being a very busy spot, the staff was very attentive and well trained.  They do have a walk up take out window as well if you want to just grab a bite and take it back to your room."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese food in the state. I recommend this place if you want to have excellent Chinese food."}
{"text":"**Drinks only**
PF Changs for me in general is a solid four star place. Love the food (especially the quality and consitency of product) and decor.
Tonight I wanted to grab a quick brew before a Yelp event. NODA Midnight Madness on tap? Impressive. Bartender who waited on me? Not so much. So I was carded. No big deal. All part of the transaction. Then he got a little bit snippy and asked me to take the card out of the clear case in my wallet. Really? I have bifocals and crow's feet. Really? Procedue is one thing, but being a jerk is another. How do I know? No one else, even way younger \"twentysomething\" looking people that came to the bar after me, got carded. I think he realized he crossed a line and tried to backpedal, making a joke. Too late dude. So what did I do? I tipped $2 bucks on a $6 beer. Kill'em with kindness, keep it classy and really make him feel like an ass."}
{"text":"Scuzy waiter. Scuzy manager. Overall just a bad experience. The food was pretty awful too. I don't understand how this place is so successful! The food was either waaaay over-seasoned of severely under-seasoned. A hole in the wall Chinese restaurant can produce better Chinese food. And at cheaper prices. Search around. It'll be well worth it."}
{"text":"I hate this place.
It's very loud, the service is very poor, and the food is so-so.
If you want good Chinese in Pittsburgh, try China Palace (Shadyside) or Sesame Inn (Station Square or North Hills).  They're quieter, with very good food & service."}
{"text":"Received a gift card to PF-Chang and thought this would be a good excuse to try this 'China bistro'. We only ate a little bit at the restaurant because we didn't like any of our dishes and packed most of it for home...got my surprise when I ate my fried rice the next day.

First of all-If people think that going here would call itself as 'having Chinese food'. It could be farther fetched. It is Chinese-fusion at best...but that isn't even good.

Food dishes were ok. Not really any Asian flare, besides using some Asian vegetables. we had the lemon chicken, crab wontons, beef and broccoli and beef fried rice. All were just blah- the lower end Chinese take-out places are tastier than this. To top if off my fried rice had a quarter size egg shell in it...if it was like a 1/4inch piece...ok shit. An happen. But that thing was a size of a quarter...can't fish that out???? How did you not notice it fell in it.

Only 1 star for ambience. Interior is nice, semi circular bar is ok. But overall I will not go back here no recommend this place. I can get better Chinese food at China-a-go-go....and that means a lot. For the same  value at PF Chang I could get like twice the items and at least have more flavorful food. If you want to eat Chinese, go to Chinatown. Otherwise-don't waste your time dressing up and have some blah fusion food."}
{"text":"I love, love, love PF Changs!  Been going there for years.  We usually sit at the bar and the bartenders are friendly and efficient.  Phil, Brandon, Ryan, Brian, Atasia, Jonathan - all fantastic!!  But Andrew?  Stuck up little piece of fabric softener who ignores you unless you actually call his name.  You have to tell him what you want a minimum of 3 times before he actually gets it.  Pretty inefficient and just struts around trying to figure out what he needs to do.  I've never seen him do any prep work like the others and there is no interaction with the customers.  I'm sorry, Changs, this ones a miss."}
{"text":"I generally love PF Changs and eat there at least once a week at the Green Valley Ranch location.  This review is based on a particular server at the Rampart location where I met a friend for lunch today.  A server other than my waitress brought out the food with white rice on the plate.  I told him I ordered brown rice.  He said that's not how he received the order.  He didn't want to correct the problem.  I then asked him if he could take it back and give me brown rice.  He said he could but he didn't want to get his germs in my food.  Excuse me?!  Was he threatening to spit in my food, or what?  Then he reluctantly agreed to bring me some brown rice and as he sauntered off like he was strolling in the park, he started twirling his tray in the air!! I have never, in my life, encountered a server so intent on offending a customer.  The waitress (Nano) brought the brown rice and swapped it for the white on my plate.  Usually the service is good, but this guy was unbelievable!  I won't be going back to this location and plan to talk to the GM at the GVR location about it.  This shouldn't happen in ANY restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love PF Changs, have been coming here for years. We have had bad services at other P F Chang's however this one has had better waiters. We have tried just about every item on the menu however my favorites are the Shrimp Dumplings, orange chicken, Mongolian beef, double pan fried noodles and for dessert the banana spring rolls. There's many more that i loved but these are the ones we always get. The price is a bit high but we still come the food."}
{"text":"This was some great food. I have never ate at this place before so I was impressed. The staff was nice and helpful. The drinks were great and the food was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I frequent here because it is so close to work.  You have to get there right at 11am to get seated right away or call in your order.  I have tried to order online, but my order was incorrect.  The staff here is always friendly.  Today, I presented a free appetizer card to our server ...and the card was for the Superstition location and they honored it here.  No questions asked.  We have come for their happy hour special which starts at 3pm..and that's great because our work group gets out at 3pm.  So, it's a nice option within downtown Tempe that it starts early.  Not too many places start at 3pm.  All in all this location does everything to give great service, especially if they know your work within the area."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is everything here. Great for date nights. Great service. We went on a weekend and it was slammed. The room was noisy. Food was overly salty and greasy. Average quality. Had the appetizer, dinner and dessert. Waiters always expect extra here. 30% min. otherwise they will glare."}
{"text":"Ate there after watching Vegas the Show at the Saxe Theatre. Food was alright, but service was slow. Seemed like we were there forever with empty water glasses. Prob won't go again."}
{"text":"Had the beef with broccoli and beef lo mein. Both were very good. Good sized portions. They have nice, large booths all along the outer wall. Very comfortable. Arrived about 5:30 on a Wednesday and no trouble whatsoever being seated in one of those roomy booths. By the time we left about an hour and a half later, it was very busy.

Our server - and I wish I could remember her name - was terrific. Very attentive, quick and not intrusive while holding a nice conversation when dropping off the drinks. Speaking of drinks,  we both ordered a glass of wine. Our server asked if we wanted a \"glass and a half\" for a small add-on feel. So, we did. But honestly, the \"glass and a half\" is just your usual glass of wine when it's all said and done. So that was a little bit of a letddown and the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5..

Like a dummy, I left my credit card in the bill holder and didn't realize it until two days later. I called the restaurant and they said they had it and I could come pick it up anytime. I appreciated them holding onto it, rather than cutting it up. Saved me a phone call to the CC company and replacing a lost card.

Very good experience overall. In fact, I can't really think of any negatives. Would most certainly go back."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, the tacos and fried cauliflower are awesome . Haven't tried the chicken wings yet and they were sold out last time but they sound great and the price is nice.  Nice ambiance outside and in lounge area.  Their Moscow mule, my personal favorite, is made with house made ginger beer but is still just average as far as mules go.  Fried rice, lettuce cups are awesome.  I look forward to going back after not being there for a long time.   Now the staff... the closing bartender is a cool guy, really seems to care even when we came in 15 before close.   On the other hand , out last experience we had a blond server who was just ok... very slow to put food in, seemed more interested in floating around aimlessly.. also was extremely clueless when it came to my girl's strict dietary needs ( she's vegan and gluten intolerant , among other things ). But when her food came out screwed up the blond server didn't really seem to care but she did get it fixed.. check time was when she really screwed up.   We went for happy hour but because she took her sweet time ringing in our drinks and food most of it didn't go in under happy hour so we were overcharged about 25$... also to add tofu is
More expensive than adding chicken (?!?!?!) when questioned, the server did fix the bill but passive aggressively blamed it on us... then corrected my girl about the tofu price (\" for future reference \") seeing as how I've been a chef for 13 years and my girl had been in the front of the house ) including P.F. Chang's back in the day) the way this woman handled herself and through in that little shot pissed me off and was also very impolite and rather rude.. she is in major need of some restaurant etiquette classes.  I hope she is never our server again, and if by chance she is, I will request someone else, to her face.
     But overall, good food, good happy hour, lots of selection in the main menu section, and nice romantic ambiance at night.  Staff does need a little more practice with dietary restricted guests and the kitchen manager ( since they most likely don't have a chef) needs to get off his lazy bum and be willing to make simple substitutions.. nothing crazy but they won't even sub sauces or much else to make more food available for those with restrictions... when it can easily be done by anyone with half a brain.  I will definitely go back, I I hope In the meantime they learn how to make a proper spicy tuna mix instead of the bland junk they serve now."}
{"text":"Ok. So I ask for one ingredient left out of sushi roll. Waiter say chief only train 40 minutes and can not make. Scary!

I eat only steam broccoli instead. It no cooked! And cost $8.00 USD.

Food not taste like Chinese. Waiter stand too close. Very annoying."}
{"text":"Visited this location and the meal was great.  All the entrees were seasoned well and plentiful.  The family style  servings were more than enough for a family of four.  The server was attentive and helpful throughout the meal. Great experience."}
{"text":"I have been to P.F. Chang's several times and its always good.  I was a little disappointed today as we visited during lunch opening and service was extremely slow.  Once it got started however things went well.  We had tofu wraps, Thai coconut curry vegetables . All delicious!  Food tasted good, service picked up, and the heat was turned up.  Will be back of course"}
{"text":"The waiter recommended shrimp with lobster sauce and the honey chicken. The portions were served piping hot and there was more than enough to share. The ambiance was dark and cozy. It was a perfectly still Arizona night and the large outdoor patio was full on this September evening. The trio of sauces help kick up the flavor."}
{"text":"Standard PF Chang's fare.  I had the Mongolian beef.  It was great, but the rice was dry.  Really dry.  I wasn't impressed.  We had a table of eight and our server was awesome!!  She busted her ass and still had other tables.  I was very impressed with her.  I would have given 3 stars expect for the fact that the service really brought up the whole experience."}
{"text":"Great food and an excellent choice for someone with food allergies. I had tons of options for gluten and dairy free and the staff was very accommodating. I visited this location twice because I was so impressed and I didn't feel sick afterwards. Also quick!"}
{"text":"Terrible food, ordered the Kung Po Chicken and Beef Pepper both were extremely salty and loaded with MSG. The rice was mushy and tasted like it was reheated on a steam table. We took a few bites and sent everything back, so did 2 other tables nearby. Does anybody check the food before it leaves the kitchen? Our dinner was comped but that's not enough for us to return."}
{"text":"Go here frequently but not anymore after tonight. First the server was nice enough but literally was non existent. Took over ten minutes to get a cocktail. Took forever for the food. And the food was terrible! It's gone down hill lately but tonight was the worse. Had the dry rub ribs which usually fall off the bone, not tonight they were rubber and probably microwaved. Then our food came and it smelled funny and tasted terrible. Then it literally took the server well over a half hour from the time we got our food to check on us and then bring our check. Very disappointment because usually a great time. My husband and I literally planned and considered doing a dine and dash for the twenty minutes we sat there after finishing our food. Really sad since this was one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"This place was so disoriented when I visited.  I went for dinner and we had to wait an hour for the food to come after we ordered from the server.  The meals all came out at different times and it was so awkward to all eat at different times.  My food was not hot at all so I had to send it back.  The waiter wasn't really giving us a good explanation of why it was taking so long and why the food didn't come out hot.  She said that the cooks don't know how to cook in the kitchen.... hmmm. The manager didn't have any idea why the kitchen was being so slow."}
{"text":"I'm going to stop going to these restaurants since the company must be training their servers to make the guest wait as long as possible before approaching the table.  ITS RIDICULOUS that we have to wait more than 15 minutes now for someone to take our drink orders while  watching servers chat it up with the hostess and the manager. I'm typing this review STILL waiting for a server! This has been a problem at 3 of the the PF Changs I've been to recently and 2 of them were in Scottsdale. THIS IS A PROBLEM MANAGEMENT SO FIX IT."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant all 5 stars because the food is always great!! In fact it's my favorite place to eat. The reason then for 2 stars is the incredible long wait when there were tables open and they say 3 groups that came after us before us! The seating is poorly managed and the hostess' are rude. When we were FINALLY seated after a 45 minute wait we passed 4 open tables to be seated at a table right by the kitchen, the noise was so loud we couldn't talk. NOT A HAPPY NEW YEAR!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge PF Changs fan! I eat there atleast once a week so when I saw a Changs I haven't been to at Happy Valley I thought I'd try it. Disappointed is a good word for it. The waitress was less than attentive, we waited for refills often, she vanished for most of our meal showing up again to stock the chip stick holder while we were in the middle of eating and talking. The sofa I ordered tasted off and the sweet and sour chicken didn't taste right. All you n all disappointing. I'll stick with my favorite Changs locations in Scottsdale and tempe"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The service was not so great. I don't know if we had a new waiter or what was going on. Several issues with our orders but we finally got it straightened out. I get home back to FL and I check my credit card statement. The waiter added another dollar to the tip I had already written. He didn't deserve more than 20%. I thought I was being fair with 20% even if there were mistakes made. The manager kept checking in on us. At some point, you just want your food and eat in peace. HA"}
{"text":"Really great food.  A friend told me to get the lo mein because it's the best in Charlotte.  She was right!   We had a great server and great food. Also try the lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"We come to this location frequently for both take-away and dine-in due to its convenient location- proximity to 215, our home, and to the GVR movie theater.  We decided to go low key this New Year's Eve with dinner and a movie.  I made a reservation in advance, but due to the volume of people in the restaurant, we had to wait about 10 minutes.  Way better than the 60-75 minute wait being quoted to walk-ins.  

After we were seated we were greeted promptly.  I have never seen so many staff in Chang's before.  I think they were trying to turn tables as fast as possible.  

We started with a couple of delicious Bud Lights ($4 each, not bad).  Since we perused the menu while waiting, we had already decided on the 4 course prix - fixe menu for $39.95.  I started with egg drop, he started with hot and sour.  Both standard and good.  Next on to the Lettuce Wraps.  Always a favorite.  They were crunchy and fresh.   I added a bit of the spicy sauce they whipped up at the table.  Delicious, but why do I always run out of lettuce?!

For entrées we went with Beef Lo Mein and Chang's Spicy Chicken.  I also ordered a pot of tea.

Lo Mein- The noodles were tender and the beef crispy and the Lo Mein sauce was flavorful.  I do think it was a little light on meat this time.

Chang's Chicken- while spicy is in the name, the dish is not very spicy, however it is very good.  The all white meat chicken was tender and seasoned well.

We did feel a little rushed during this visit...our lettuce wraps came out before we even started our soup.  But given the holiday, I understood.  Plus, we were able to get to the earlier showing of Unbroken, so it worked out okay."}
{"text":"Came here for a Birthday and we were treated great. Our main waiter was Lawrence and he was amazing.

I had the orange peel shrimp and it was great. I also tasted the walnut, melon and shrimp dish and it was wonderful too.

From drinks and appetizers to our main courses everything was wonderful.
I can highly recommend this PF Chang's."}
{"text":"Wow, this is my new \"go to\" for Chinese cuisine! First and foremost let me just say that the wait staff was superb! They are friendly, prompt, courteous; everything is about customer service. The environment is clean and beautifully and ornately decorated without being cheesy! And the food........it was amazing! My husband and I had vegetable lo mein and sesame chicken and it was just delicious! He had the hot and sour soup which he said was great. The oolong tea, a bit expensive at $3.50, was delicious and it was a bottomless pot. Even the fortune cookie was fresh and tasty. The entrees were a little bit on the pricy side but, hey, I'd rather spend a little more and get fresh, hot, delicious food! So the experience was definitely 5 star for  us!"}
{"text":"I always love PF but this one didn't meet expectations in the customer service department. There was one host that seemed really competent and helpful, but the other one seemed a little displeased to be at work. We waited longer than our quoted wait time (which isn't a big deal, busy restaurants have a lot to keep track of) but then we were taken to a section of the restaurant that seemed like the overflow area, which is a good idea for underquoted wait times but ended up feeling like it wasn't a part of the restaurant because it was so desolate. There was a bar there but no one was working it. There was only one other table sat there which seemed to make it hard for our server to keep up with us because it was probably pretty far away from her section. Anyway, the food was great but we ate most of it with empty drinks because we didn't see anyone for most of the night. It was probably just the busy nature of the night, but usually I am pretty impressed with PF keeping up with that.


(I just realized I gave this review to the wrong location, it was supposed to be for the PF located on the strip. I changed it to 5 stars because I didn't want to give an unfair review to the restaurant it didn't belong to .)"}
{"text":"Quite disappointed this time around. The hostess seemed a bit peeved when we requested a different table. Our server was really great. She was attentive and efficient. The food was ehh - heavy handed on the sushi roll sauce and crispy beans - greasy. My big issue was watching the manager stand by doing nothing, as a very large group attempted to get settled. He watched as customers moved tables and chairs around and never once intervened. Why is this man in charge???"}
{"text":"Ambiance- A
Sanitation score- A+ on the wall but they were a strong B. 
Service- A+. Our server was great!
Food- C. Save your money and eat at the local Chinese joint. They have the same food with the exception of their egg rolls."}
{"text":"94.5 sanitation rating. Sat at this place for 2 hours for lunch. Served nasty lettuce wraps after waiting for the ones they messed up, spoke with manager and he said they take 30 seconds to remake. Really? So what was the holdup to begin with? Unless you have a couple hours to spare do not plan on coming here. This is the second time this has happened. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious food.
Szechuan beef
Salt and pepper prawns.   
Patio was great to people watch."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at PF Chang's.  One of the few places where you can get a meal for a decent price.  Food was standard Asian Fusion Cuisine. Service was okay but nothing memorable.  The Plum sauce for the Crab Rangoon's was good though.   If you are gambling in Planet Hollywood and need some place to grab a bite, Id say check this place out."}
{"text":"I  just had a great night with my family at P.F. Chang's in scottsdale tonight. I was grateful to secure. A reservation last minute, and our server Chaz was both delightfully  entertaining, and attentive.  The food was delicious i'm just a big fan of the Brussels sprouts and the salmon to the fried Rice's was served  and enjoyed. Thank you for making our family night easy with good food great atmosphere, and awesome service,   Thank you Chaz !and staff!"}
{"text":"What amazing service! Especially from the manager Amanda a few weeks ago I came in with a gift card for $100 and purchased a pick up order with my order I think I left my gift card there when I called she remembered me and said that she would give me the balance for my gift card and had something typed up for me when I came to pick it up she kept it for a few weeks and had it all laid out for if anyone else were to be there when she was not there when I came in tonight my meal was completely taken care of with this gift card that was my fault for losing I really appreciated the amazing customer service and the food is always great thanks again Amanda and your team!!!"}
{"text":"it was pouring rain and downright miserable outside, so birthday dinner needed to be close to home and pf changs fit the bill. we had the same waiter as last time, which was kinda funny. i ordered another red wine flight, server's choice, and his selections were excellent (again). he kept the beers and cold glasses coming, which made g very happy. service was attentive and authentic - i really like this guy. our food (beef with broccoli and sezchuan seafood - you can choose the scallop, shrimp and calamari mix if you like!) was most excellent and the beef with broccoli had lots of sauce. the standout item was the hot and sour soup ... i can't wait to go back to have some more ... i'll probably order it for takeout on chilly nights and when i'm sick too. hot and sour soup always makes me feel better when i'm sick."}
{"text":"Brandon was amazing!!! Attentive, knowledgeable, friendly!  We started off with pan fried pork dumplings....amazing!!! Off to eggs rolls and sweet and sour chicken! Everything was amazing...we all know service is key to an establishment! Thank you for helping us and guiding us through a great lunch!"}
{"text":"One star for the more upscale ambience and the drinks. But those things I can find in just about any decent bar. 

As a brand name, P.F. Chang's had so much potential to streamline Chinese food. It would be an understatement to say that that ship has sailed, capsized, and sank to the bottom of the food industry sea. 

This location in particular has committed one of my personal cardinal sins of dining: service so deliberately awful that you just can't help but take it personally. 

I came here with one other person on a weekday afternoon for an early dinner. The place was practically empty, except for a couple other small parties sitting nearby. 

Every time we asked our server for something, she glared at us as if we had just insulted her mother rather than asked for the check. Which we did, repeatedly. We could see that she wasn't busy because she was literally two tables down, chatting it up and laughing with the customers seated there. A complete 180 from the attitude we received. After 30 more minutes of waiting at a table full of dirty dishes, we finally got fed up and went up to the front register to pay. 

Thanks but no thanks for the horrific service, the time wasted here I will never get back, and the extraneous sodium intake with the bad aftertaste. If this was the last restaurant left on earth, I wouldn't come here. I would rather forage or starve. Bye!"}
{"text":"Great service. Andrew was an awesome waiter. Very nice and polite. Made my first experience here a great one. I spoke to the manager and let him know how great he was very professional and good service we had. 

We had an appetizer sorry guys it was changes chicken lettuce wraps. And it was amazing. My boyfriend and I shared chicken pad Thai and   Mongolian beef OMG AMAZING. For dessert we ate a the Great Wall of chocolate, it was amazing very big portion actually didn't expect that. I had a wine it was the rosatello wine I loved it. Thanks everyone it was great"}
{"text":"Solid experience.  Went here twice in three days since I'm here on business.  I sat at the bar both times and was served by Gerald at the bar.  He did his job perfectly.  The food came out hot and fast.  Everything was great - Mongolian Beef, spring rolls, hot and sour soup.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've been to many asian restaurants in town and have to say that PF Changs is as good as most or better.   The main reason for this is that if you go to a Dim Sum restaurant and don't speak the language, you may not know what it is that you are eating, and that can be pretty scary.  That said, I have had some great experiences at the Spring Mountain Road restaurants.

Food is perfection.  Buddha's Feast (veggies) stir fried spicy is as good as it gets!  Kung pow's are all great.  The rice is sticky and tasty.  Nice ambiance and decor.  Waiter/waitress very nice and helpful.  If your in a rush, it's quick.  Close to Las VEgas Blvd. so very convenient.

Suggestion: Add parking lot security, as the restaurant is located across from the Silver 7 casino where a whole host of degenerate meth-head alcoholics gamble.  They then seem to think of the Changs parking lot as hand out city."}
{"text":"I've only been to PF Changs a few times, and try to support local businesses whenever possible. However, being vegan, in Vegas...my choices were a bit limited, so I ended up eating here twice.

No wonder this place is one of PETA's top 5 Veg-Friendly Chains! Both times I was there, the servers were extremely knowledgeable about what menu items were options for me, and tweaked items to make them vegan. 

As previous reviewer said, there is no price mark-up here, which was a nice surprise. 

If you're vegan, or visiting Vegas with someone who is, put PF Changs on your list of food options."}
{"text":"My boo thang took me here to celebrate my job promotion. He told the waiter and the waiter celebrated the excitement. He congratulated me and told me he has a special dessert for me. I told him it was not necessary. We ordered the meal good for two. The lettuce wraps are amazing! I prefer the egg drop soup over the sweet and sour soup. But I'm a fan of egg drop soup and this one was tasty! I wouldn't recommend the Mongolian beef. Our waiter brought out the banana dessert for us which was so delicious! He congratulated me again before we left. I would go back with or without a celebration."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. Waited nearly 20 minutes for them to clean a table off outside on the patio and at no point were we even acknowledged. NONE of the tables were cleaned off from dirty dishes that looked like they'd been sitting there for at least the past hour. Will NOT be returning again and I will make sure to steer people away from this awful restaurant."}
{"text":"My mother and I had a very pleasant experience here today. We both ordered egg drop soup that came less than 5 minutes after we were seated, and was delicious. The kaleidoscope roll and lobster tacos were incredibly fresh tasting! I love that they have vegetarian and gluten free options as well.  Our server and the manager came by often to check up and refill our drinks, and were very friendly. We were even offered iced tea to go before we left, and the manager was at the front to ask about our meal and open the door as we left. Although the fact that they were slow may have contributed to the special attention, they went above and beyond to make our experience pleasurable."}
{"text":"PF Chang's is one of my favorite places to go for dinner an has always been outstanding. But recently I was very disappointed. We recently called to get an order for take out. It was a special occasion for my bf an I an wanted a nice romantic dinner at home. We called an ordered 3 appetizers an 3 main course meals. When we got the food home I couldn't believe how awful it was a the portions were barely enough. The crab won tons were burnt an the shrimp pan fried dumplings the northern style ribs were ok but not as good as when we eat in. The entree portion of Mongolian beef, honey crispy chicken were so little we could hardly share. The only entree that was a little better was the ginger chicken. It was like they had given food for maybe 1 person. It was very disappointing. I will never get take home again. Going in an eating is definitely better. Although it should be good either way"}
{"text":"This chain use to be at the forefront of asian fusion cuisine, now I'd rather go to a family run Chinese resturant."}
{"text":"I've eaten at PF Changs a total of 2 times, once about 6-7 years ago and then again just this month. We only dined here because another couple with whom we wanted to have dinner picked this place. The first time I had eaten here several years back I did not enjoy my food at all. In fact i could not even tolerate eating it. I had ordered the Lemon Chicken, which should be renamed \"Lemon with some chicken in there somewhere\" because all I could taste was the overpowering lemon.
Unfortunately we had to venture back here for a second time due to our friends suggesting we meet them here for a date night several times. Positive experience from this visit is that we did get seated right away and our server was attentive.  As far as the ambience of this restaurant i would describe it as having a dark, classy, and romantic feel. However do not feel the need to dress up by any means because the other diners will not be. Even though it appears higher end and nice inside I would not suggest having a \"romantic date night\" planned here as you may be surrounded by large groups dressed in jeans and sweatshirts with children running everywhere or babies crying. 
As for the food, it is your basic \"Americanized\" Chinese  food with a larger price tag and smaller portion than your average Chinese take out place with no real difference in taste or quality. Everyone who dines here rants and raves about their lettuce wraps being AMAZING! I tried them during this most recent visit and thought they were good but I wouldn't go as far as saying they are amazing. For my entrée, I tried their beef and broccoli which was good but was just as good as the beef and broccoli I get at my Chinese food place in my small hometown. For dessert, my boyfriend and I shared the Salted Caramel cake which we both enjoyed because of its lightness (wasn't overly sweet).

To sum things up:
Do not come here for a romantic date night
If you don't mind paying extra and getting less portion-wise for standard Americanized Chinese food place than this is the place for you. 

If you want really good Chinese go elsewhere! I suggest Wah Kee (@ 600 Williamson St. Madison, WI 53703) or  for a Tradional Southeast Asain eatery give Ha Long Bay a try (@ 1353 Williamson Street Madison Wi 53703). They are not as fancy on the inside as PF Changs but your food will be more outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a cozy spot, if you get a booth on the perimeter. 
Our waiter was spot on.  My water glass was never empty and the table was kept clear of spent dishes.  
The Lettuce Wraps were delicious but they seemed to cool quickly. The sushi was good, the wasabi was fresh.  
The Chicken Pad Thai comes with baked tofu. Not my thing. The Ginger Chicken and Broccoli was mediocre; the broccoli was borderline raw and had no flavor or seasoning. The Hot and Sour soup was also just so-so. 
Over all the music was loud and I felt rushed. I can't put my finger on it."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's was delicious as usual. 

Instead of ordering their $44 lunch for two, we ordered what we wanted and it came out to be about the same price anyway. We had the lemongrass prawns & garlic noodles; sauteed spinach; spring rolls, and steamed dumplings.  That was more than enough for 2 for lunch.

I had a Lucky Cat Martini. OMG super delicious. 

Justin, our server, was really nice, prompt, and funny, too, with the little jokes.

I always return to P.F. Changs for consistent, quick, asian bistro food. Its delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far the best Chinese restaurant I've ever frequented.  They have always been very accommodating to me for business occasions, family events, and every day dining.  I'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews, because this place is second to none!  My favorite are the Chang's spare ribs, Shrimp fried rice, and chicken lettuce wraps!"}
{"text":"Service tonight was as slow as molasses on a cold winter night. Granted we took a few extra moments to order our food, but it still took 40minutes to get to our table. When we asked the server what was wrong she said she didn't know and that the kitchen has been slow all day. Then we asked to speak to the manager and it was apparent that she was just as bad as her crew. She took another 10minutes to get to the table. I just don't under stand how Chinese food takes this long to cook. It's Chinese food!! 

Anyhow, the reason I gave it 2 stars is mainly because the food tastes yummy and the manager took care of 2 of the doses on the bill. Those little things they did to rectify the situation could have been avoided and this review may have had 4-5 stars. 

I've had better. So sad."}
{"text":"PF Chang you suck for not giving me a table. The lady at the counter was so rude, she said:\"we can sit but that it\" implying that I might not be able to get food. She needs a new job. Rude ass person and mess up establishment."}
{"text":"I am officially a fan of this place because of the service that I recently received while there for lunch.

I went there for lunch on 5/19/2013, sat in the bar and was quickly greeted by the bartender, Ross.

I can honestly say that I've never had service this superior in the Phoenix area.  Ross was professional, kind, expedient and knowledgeable. He treated me like I was a guest in his own home. How unbelievably refreshing!

Thank you, Ross, for making my visit to P.F. Chang's, so utterly enjoyable!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at PF Chang's I will start buy saying this location in South park is beautiful I love the area.  Parking is rough to come back in the man lot. They do have complementary Valet parking so that is good if you're not waiting for him.  The decor is similar to every other PF Changs similar to a Cheesecake Factory.  It was VERY loud in there we had trouble hearing each other talk on a busy Saturday night.

I ordered the Korean BBQ Chicken Stir fry it was pretty good nothing special or amazing but good.  My girlfriend orderd the Honey Chicken was also was good but nothing special.  All in all it you can tell they use quality ingredients in the food but it really is high priced Chinese food in my opinion. Yes I would go back but not in any hurry to go!"}
{"text":"P.F Changs has been one of my favorite places to eat for a while now. They never let me down. They have great regular happy hour specials and great dinner specials as well. I always order the lettuce wraps I think they are amazing especially when topped off with the Chile paste they give you. The combo Lo mein noodles are what I normally get and its always great. Costumer service has always been great which makes it that much better. Would definitely recommend eating here if your in the mood for some good food!!"}
{"text":"My service has been excellent. I came in alone requested a table the wait 10 minutes and the petite  hostess with the long blonde hair came up to me and said your table is ready when ever you are ready. I thought that was the definition of excellent customer service.  Found out they call her breezy. 

My server Josh was polite and charming he also have excellent service. Not to mention easy on the eyes. As I looked at my menu I was sad to see they removed Dan Dan noodles. One of my favorite. My server said we can make them for you still. Made me happy. I always have left overs so before you judge. I take a lot home. Tomorrows lunch is going to be awesome!

 I ordered egg rolls which were blah. The rolls weren't fresh and I can tell because normally I have to cut them in half to cool because they are steaming hot. This time they were barely warm and the sauce had a strong mustard flavor and sent. I do not recommend the egg rolls. 0/5 I would have sent them back but I was starving and I learned a long time ago never send food back unless it's under cooked. Then I ordered the Chang's spicy chicken substitute shrimp. So delicious. If you always get the Chang's chicken try it with shrimp. The shrimp is a game changer! It has a slight crispiness to it.  Comes with rice I always choose Brown rice. 5/5   Also I got my Dan Dan noodles. So good. Romen noodles with diced up chicken a Brown sauce, bean sprouts and shreds of cucumber. 5/5

Because of my amazing service and all the great shrimp and noodles that weren't on the menu  I am giving them 5/5 stars just don't order the egg rolls."}
{"text":"This was a great experience our greeter to the waiter was so kind. This was my bday dinner meal. We truly enjoyed the ambience so peaceful and nice. I wanted to stay longer just to indulge in the atmosphere. Our food was hot and fresh and delicious. This was the best wonton soup! We also ordered rib appetizer and two entrees with fried rice. Overall experience great downfalls no military discount and limited dessert options for bday"}
{"text":"This restaurant lets pet dogs inside.  It's disgusting.  The food isn't clean.  They don't care about customers with allergies."}
{"text":"The sit down service is awful. In the evening the wait times are insane and can be near 2 hours to wait for a table. When you complain they claim you can make a reservation, however, it is nearly impossible to get a table in a regular dining time on a Friday. I have been doing a lot of take out from this restaurant but figured the quality has decreased in the past 6 months. Not sure if management or cooking recipes were changed, but I have decided this PF Changs is not on my books anymore. Too bad..."}
{"text":"We have this rule, as travelers, that involves never dining at a restaurant if we have one just like it at home. However. . . this one in Planet Hollywood is hard to resist! You can enter from the street or the casino. So convenient!
We love to sit at the bar, and watch everything going on around us, as well as the TV's. There's usually a game on that my husband needs to watch. The food is always yummy. This time, we started with Edamame and moved straight into the Hokkien Street Noodles, something new for us. 
Aaron served us well, kept our drinks coming and our water glasses full."}
{"text":"My DH and I love PF Chang's! We got to the one in San Diego as well as visit any locations in cities we are visiting. We were excited to learn that there was a PF Chang's in the hotel we were staying!! I made reservations for Friday night (HIGHLY recommend reservations for the weekends)! The service was great as was their Pear Mojito, but the food was just okay. It didn't have the usual good flavor and only seemed to be luke warm. Also the garlic noodles were really on the rubbery side. I have to say we were pretty disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Chicken Lettuce Wraps.. Their delicious and anyone who thinks any different is a charlatan, yeah .. I said it..! 
That being said, they have some of the best in the city, not too greasy like other spots and not too salty.. They also manage to hide water chestnuts in there which I hate but they found a way to make them tasty... Technically I could give them 5 stars. For what I typically like to eat from \"chinese\" restaurants they fill me up and have some tasty dishes but the 3 star ratings comes from their inability to substitute fried rice! 
Yeah.. Big annoyance for me, it literally makes me angry to think about my inability to eat fried rice with my dinner without having to order a $ 10 meal size portion of fried rice. I'm unsure if this is location specific b/c I have had fried rice subbed at the Summerlin location but I guess on the strip they live by strip rules.. I had to deal with it.. but I wasnt happy ! and clearly from this post... I'm still not happy about it..!"}
{"text":"Came in for an early dinner Saturday night with my mom. We had not been back in over 6 months because the last time we were here we had bad food and bad service. We were in the mood for Chinese food so we decided to try it again. Brice was our server and was amazing and super attentive. Food was significantly better than our previous experience. Must have new management as well, they stopped by our table to see how everything was- always nice to see a manner actually in front of house helping guests and staff.  Good gluten free selection as well. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Always great food, but the service is HORRIBLE and always has been. They also mis-communicate what they tell you over the phone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in for our date over the weekend and we were greeted by such a sweet hostess named Vanessa! She made me feel very comfortable and even asked us how our day was going and what we planned on doing :)

Our server, Mason was on top of his stuff! Making sure we had our drinks always refilled, and got our appetizer and entrees out on time. He was a funny and nice server, my boyfriend and I really enjoyed our time there and would recommend this PF Changs to anyone! 

Thank you for having such a wonderful staff & such great food."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch at the bar and watch the Masters. This location has two small TVs  on either side of the bar.  The food is consistent as is other PF Changs.  Shannon the bartender was running the bar and the floor.  She was Awesome. Made us feel Welcome, at home and very attentive. Would come back and sit at the bar if she is here."}
{"text":"The food and the service was just \"Okay\". For the price of the food you would expect to get refills on your drinks, and the occasional \"Hows everything\". This was not the case. Was a bit disappointing , and really do not think we will go back."}
{"text":"I hate to admit when I can't help but like something that is such a far cry from the \"real deal.\" Chang's is a classic example. They serve delicious panasian cuisine. . . that is neither pan nor asian. 

But, hey, call a spade a spade, it's tasty. Anyone who says they don't even mildly like the lettuce wraps is either lying, or just doesn't like things that taste good. 

The seared ahi tuna appetizer is also dee-lish. As is the honey seared anything, and the Chang's Spicy Chicken. 

It ain't the cheapest food around, nor the most authentic, but damned if it isn't good."}
{"text":"Ramsey is my favorite Barmacist at PFCHANG BANG SHANGALANG

He treated me like a Kardashian and I am a senior citizen.  He was very engaging and attentive.

Yelp Hugs to PFCHANG and Team Ramsey!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese food, great times here! We loved it! Probably some of the best freshest tasting Chinese food ever!"}
{"text":"Over priced food. Best bet is to just drink there lol go to hibachi somewhere else for the price/food quantity"}
{"text":"Having been here for both lunch and dinner I can absoutely report that P.F. Changs is A-OK.  The appeal has lost its luster to me personally because I have been there pretty often when I use to work on that side of town but it's still a great place for food and great quality food at that.   

The service is always solid and I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal.  Lettuce wraps, seared ahi tuna and low mein meals really do the trick for me.

Parking is somewhat of a challenge here but you can always valet if you feel like it.  I suggest it really."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's isn't bad by any means, but if you are in Madison and want Chinese food, go to Imperial Gardens.  Bigger portions for less money."}
{"text":"For a P.F. Chang's, this one is pretty good.   You get all the food you come here for, the service is excellent and the place is immaculate.   It's a little slow --- we came here at 5 and got out an hour and a half later.  Our waitress was awesome tho."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, fast service. I had the Dynamite Shrimp which was fabulous and just the right portion to fill me up. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Chinese sounded good, what better place to satiate our craving than PF Chang's?  I always know what to expect out of the menu when dining here--the only thing that's noticeably different are the servers.  Pretty good for overall consistency. 

Our server was very personable and catered to our every need.  We had the crab wontons, seared ahi tuna, and chicken lettuce wraps to start. The wontons are always sinfully delicious. The tuna was dressed with an extremely salty dressing--wayyy too salty for both our palates. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps prepared broth-velveted style, (seared with chicken broth instead of oil).  These wraps are always a winner!

The main event was orange peel chicken (it was a close call between that and sesame chicken); we chose the former because of the included veggies.  Can't decide between brown and white rice?  There's always the option of having both!

We held off on dessert, but as I recall the banana dessert is amazing (bananas wrapped in egg roll wrappers, fried to crisp perfection...I think that's what they entail...).  Beware, everything is very salty; I felt parched for days."}
{"text":"Seriously can't go wrong here! My daughter (and our buyers agent), Devin, turned 20 today and this her favorite place. We've been going here for years and years for her birthday and they never lets us down! Fantastic food and wonderful service. And the banana spring rolls for dessert? Yes please and YUM!"}
{"text":"REDO!

I went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.  

My issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.  

My resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.

So we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:

Coca Cola
Iced Tea
Pan fried pork dumplings
Sesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup
Changs chicken with white rice

Our drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.

My egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.

Our lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  

I just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better."}
{"text":"We have been here many times before and the food and service is consistent with the exception of last night. We were sat and after waiting 10 minutes we had to go ask the host for a server. When you sit down in a restaurant having a server is generally implied- but not for us. Then after a couple more minutes Anthony came over and was unapologetic and rude like we were such an inconvenience. Every time we asked for something he was bothered. My daughter tried ordering something that she hadn't realized was on the lunch menu and he was rude about that pointing to the word lunch as if she were just that dumb. When I asked if they could make her anything similar he just said no. He didn't try to offer any alternatives- just no. He seemed too be servicing tables around us but we may as well have had the plague! At the end of the meal we asked to speak with a manager, after a long wait, she came over and listened and offered to take off the two items that we didn't eat because nobody liked them. That's all she did, and then we waited another 15 minutes for a check!! It was insane and we felt complete unwelcome. Moral of the story- if you go don't sit in Anthony's section and don't look to the manager to do anything to help you out."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of PF Chang's and the high-priced wares that they offer. My mom wanted it, so to PF Chang's we go!

This is a newer restaurant, located near auto row on Superstition. The restaurant is clean, but very dark. I'm not a fan of the circular revolving doors, and most in this area are older, or even elderly (Leisure World and snowbirds), so it is difficult. At least they have a regular door off to the side. 

The menu is what you would expect: rices and noodles. I opted for the chicken lettuce wraps. They give you a ton of lettuce - way more that you need for the chicken. The chicken was a little salty, and tasted like the dish I get at the nearby Chinese joint for half the price. Mom got a noodle bowl from the lunch menu, and really enjoyed it. Even though it was listed as spicy, you can customize your spice level. J got the honey walnut shrimp. It was different - served with honeydew melon balls. I actually liked the melon better than the shrimp. The mayonnaise sauce was tangy and not at all sweet...like it came straight from a jar of Miracle Whip. We both disliked it. For appetizers, we shared shrimp pan-fried dumplings. They were just okay. Nothing to write home about. The egg rolls were generic, and the weird sweet and sour mustard was gross. A for presentation on all of the dishes. The strawberry-ginger margarita was not mom's thing.
The large bearded man that served us was very cordial and funny. I'm sorry to not have gotten his name, but he was great. 
Wouldn't come again, unless it was someone else's choice."}
{"text":"My young son and I were recently diagnosed with celiac disease. All he wanted for his birthday meal was Chinese food, something we haven't had in ages. Tonight we ordered take out from PF Changs Gluten Free menu. We were all so excited to try the dishes. They were delicious, but twenty minutes later we both quickly realized the effects of having eaten gluten...and now at 348 am we are both still up barfing away. 

I have read great reviews from other locations of PF Changs that really honored and respected what a gluten free menu entails. Clearly the Henderson location doesn't respect or take that seriously.  If you are celiac or suffer from NonCeliac Gluten Sensitivity. BEWARE"}
{"text":"Judging by the recent barrage of bad reviews, I'm pleasantly surprised by my experience this past weekend as we headed here for a Late Lunch (4 pm). I'd skip my obligatory decor part as this is a Chain restaurant and  thus follows a set of pre defined color palettes and furnishings.

Service - Cheerful and prompt, despite the rather empty seating scene (Must've been a non traditional time to dine I guess). 

Food - Now in my opinion, PF Changs is one of the Better Chain restaurants both in quality as well as variety of food on offer. And this trip yet again succeeded!

For appetizer, OFF COURSE we ordered their Chicken Lettuce Wraps. The iceberg lettuce was fresh and crisp and played the perfect sailboat to carry that juicy chicken and it's crispy playmates!

For Mains, we ordered Kung Pao Shrimp and Walnut Shrimp with Melon, both with a side of white rice. In both the dishes, the Shrimp was succulent and coated with it's respective sauces beautifully! The peanuts and celery in Kung Pao cut through the spiciness of Sichuan sauce, thus giving it a good balance. I'm not strong enough to try the red chili peppers but my wife enjoyed them!
The Walnut Melon dish was quite the fun bag as it juggled textures and flavors, from the sweet-salty element of the aioli, to the candied oily walnuts, to the soft fruity melon and finally the crisp fried shrimp. Have them all in a single bite, it's like a mini carnival :)

To close, I'm not a fan of Chain establishments as they mostly lack soul and I truly believe in finding real gems in standalone joints. Still, PF Changs has been and continues to be a safe bet and delivers a good meal!

P.S. My wife tried their Chang's Coconut Cooler and LOVED IT so much she ordered another one!!"}
{"text":"The host was nice and friendly. He got me seated right away. My server was also very friendly. They have a good staff here. However the food was weird which is maybe why I don't eat at a PF Chang's all too often. I came here because I have some gift cards to use up. After looking over the menu, I ended up ordering their chicken pad thai and an iced tea.

*Chicken Pad Thai*
All of the correct ingredients were used, but this was not the pad thai that you would get at an authentic Thai restaurant. The portion was huge and I finished it all, so it wasn't too bad. I just wouldn't call it pad thai. :)

My server routinely checked up on me and kept my iced tea filled. Unfortunately everything was great, but the food just wasn't something that I would want to eat on a regular basis. I understand that it's a fusion restaurant, but it's just not good \"Chinese\" food especially with the cost being on the higher side."}
{"text":"Surprisingly better than what I expected. Chill vibes ,good service great food. Love it."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my girlfriend after working out at LA FITNESS  nearby... 

5 star decor!!! Beautiful inside of the restaurant. Pretty much the aesthetics of a Chinese restaurant on hgh and steroids! It was impressive.

4 star service. Our server Ryan was super nice and attentive and gave good recommendations on what we should order.

3.5 star food. Lettuce wraps with chicken were actually really good a relatively healthy.
Kung pap shrimp with rice tasted pretty delectable, and was probably my favorite entree. The pad Thai was the worst thing we got, not recommended... Tasted super bland

Overall for the price I was not impressed with pf changs... Probably wouldn't go on my own."}
{"text":"Although my food didn't come out as hot as it should have,  my waitress, Desiree and the manager, Bill,  more than made up for it.  The service was excellent. The dessert was perfect.   The most important part was my 3 year old loved his meal and was treated very well.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the outside seating. The waitress was great and the dine for two options was the way to go. Lettuce wraps and spicy chicken were yummy!"}
{"text":"I've never dined in at this location but have ordered takeout.  On a recent takeout experience on a Saturday night, as I stood there waiting to pick up my order and pay I wondered why am I a patron of this sub-par Chinese chain...and why can't they implement a better takeout process, especially on a busy evening.  

Let's start with the takeout process, calling in and placing your order is all fine and dandy but it's when you have to pick up your food that the staff must have major operational deficiencies not to realize there's a better way to do this.  I went to pick up my order on a busy Saturday evening to find the place, well busy!  I saw loads of people waiting to be seated and internally had a sigh of relief knowing that I was just paying and picking up my order and would be on my way fairly quickly.  

WRONG!  What started out as a sigh of relief transitioned into gasps of air and silent meditation trying not to freak out about the idiocy of the pick up process.  It appears that they have two sets of staff - one set to handle the dine-in customers and one set to handle the takeout customers.  I want to highlight that when I say set of staff there is more than one, often 2-3 staff members clogging up what could be a more efficient process

I'm waiting to pay and pick up my order only to be at the back of 4 customers placing take out orders.  Let me paint a picture of what's happening, 4 people in front of me each placing a ginormous order while one staff member takes the order for these customers and the other takeout staff members (2 others) stand nearby intently listening but doing absolutely nothing.  Ummm...hi, I'm over here just wanting to pay and pick up my order which I can see on the counter.  

I'm so confused, there are like 4 cash registers and about a million staff members but only one staff member for all takeout issues regardless of whether you're placing the order or picking up.  Note to PF Chang's why don't you have one staff member or create another set of staff members to solely handle the payment/pick-up portion?!?!  

This may have marginally increased the star rating but at the end of the day the food is also NOT good.  I ordered the sesame chicken which claims to be a spicy dish but my taste buds could only taste sweetness and a sad attempt at cooking Chinese food for the masses.  

Do yourself a favor and just don't go here...dine in or take out!"}
{"text":"When you want to park for this restaurant you have to use the parking garage on Ash but as long as there isn't an event you can get parking validated. 

As soon as we walked in I hated our hostess, she was not polite at all asked us if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating, it was a nice day so we chose outside and she sat us, we didn't run into her until later...

As far as our waitress goes (the blonde from Michigan) she was nice. 

It was lunch, so our meals were under $10 dollars, that's cool I guess. I ordered the Vegetarian Fried Rice with a salad. The dressing was good, and the meal was good as well, I always add sweet & sour sauce to my rice and this was all fine and dandy. 

The downfall to sitting outside is the restaurant sits on two very busy crossroads. Mill Ave and University. So enjoying the outside isn't as much fun with all the hooligans walking around and all the cars honking (because people in Arizona don't know how to drive)

I thought we were gonna leave on a good notice, but that's not how it ended. The hostess that I was telling you about in the beginning, just let's call her skin tight mini skirt girl, was the one giving us our validated card and when I asked a simple question just to make sure I would be doing it correctly, and he response made me feel like I was a dumb ass. \"Ummm no, you stick that in the machine.\" Anyone who is gonna start a response as an \"Um\" is completely unprofessional. She then started dancing around for one of her co-workers about how she was \"off work\". This girl was no doubt a party college girl who only cared about getting one night stands with bro dudes. 

At the end of the day I'm really disappointed that as a company they are hiring girls like that to represent them."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Big fan of Asian cuisine. I understand PF Changs is a chain restaurant, therefore consistency should be a prime goal. Ordered steamed pork dumplings, which were undercooked and cold. The wait staff and manager were excessively kind about comping our dumplings, explained that they're supposed to be pink, and helicoptered near our table from the rest of our meal, which was undercooked and chewy Pad Thai alongside a Korean stir fry with tough, overcooked chicken nuggets. Three stars for effort from the front staff, but the food was close to being inedible."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5. All the food was good  and we got a variety of seafood, chicken and veggie dishes and I was here with a party of six. They kept refilling my iced tea I swear I drank 5! Our server rushed us though, it seemed like he was uninterested even though we were the only party in that area of the restaurant for quite a while. Because 4 if us were having birthdays we each got to choose a free mini dessert, which was tasty.

Overall it was OK."}
{"text":"There was a time when I would eat here on a weekly basis.  While there is very little you could term \"authentic cuisine\" here, I've got to vote with my taste buds and just admit I'm still a sucker for this place.  (Boos and hisses from the crowd.)

I'm even a given for their often too-hyped appetizer- the chicken lettuce wraps (bonus for the vegetarian version too- equally good I've found).  Nobody does it this good- all the components are finely chopped and the cups of lettuce are perfectly shaped.  I even like the sauce they create for you table-side.  Start with ponzu sauce as a base, then add spicy mustard and chili sauce for some spice.  My one gripe on this app is that they never bring out enough lettuce cups.  Every table always needs a few more here.  Why not just bring them out to start with?

The main dishes are broken down by the type of meat you desire and these is (again) a nicer section for the vegetarians.  Almost everything you see is a take on a well-known American chinese dish- beef and broccoli, moo goo gai pan chicken, etc.  I just find that most, if not all, of these dishes are exceptionally well executed.  Score one for consistency.  I also find portions are big enough to share, and they generally have the price tag to match.  Luckily you also get a choice of brown or white rice, and they'll bring as much s you need.

My personal favorite is their kung pao chicken.  Sauteed with hot chili peppers and peanuts, the chicken is crispy without being breaded and has  nice touch of spice.  I also put the spicy sauce from the lettuce wraps on my rice- make it as spicy as you dare!

Couple of notes of interest here- their iced tea is all now flavored- tropical breeze or some other fruity mix.  Not too bad but not too good either.  For something different, try one of their many hot teas- the dragon oolong is especially nice.  

They have also begun pushing these mini-dessert cups that cover most of the well-known desserts categories- red velvet cake, carrot cake, smores, etc.  These are about 3-4 bites big and they all come from the freezer.  I'm not a fan.  These still have a massive cake slice called the great wall of chocolate and, believe me, you will need a small army to surmount it.

Watch out for crowds on the weekends.  Friday and Saturday night used to have a wait that could top an hour.  Most any other time, you should be able to walk right in without any wait whatsoever.  

As a big corporate chain, I should hate this place, but I just can't deny how good this place tastes.  And the primary rule is just this- let the flavor rule.  PF's has the flavor."}
{"text":"This place isn't all that but there food is OK.  There are better Chinese options for the price (try Chinese Cultural Center restaurants).  The restaurant itself is well furnished and clean but I can't get over the fact that people rave about this place."}
{"text":"Food is ok nothing special. I ordered a cup of wonton soup and dragon roll because I didn't want anything fried or layered is sugar.

Very busy and Leo is a great server. I sat on the patio which is amazing this time of year. 

4 stars for Leo and the patio"}
{"text":"The last time we were at a PF Chang's we were not impressed so we have not been to one in a few years.  Having recently moved to the West Valley we were looking for some Asian food one evening and ended up at this location.  Very nice entry, good lighting inside, seemingly clean, prefer the bar area to the dining room personally.  The servers were really good, reasonable prices, and SURPRISE, the food was really good!  Have been back again for a second visit and just as good as the first, will continue....keep it up PF Chang's."}
{"text":"Food and service were great on 2/14/2016, but unfortunately, my family and I proceeded to get food poisoning and are still recovering. Corporate did not even cover the cost of my meal, though truly, I was not expecting anything, but it did surprise me. I just want to make sure that no one else gets sick!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour to use an old gift card. 
Ordered off the happy hour menu:
Lettuce wraps, crab wontons, tempura green beans and spicy tuna roll. To drink, water and a straberry/cucumber limeade.
The limeade - I liked the way it tasted, but because it was a muddled, it was hard to drink with the provided straw. Every time you'd drink, the straw would get plugged. Frustrating & annoying. 
Lettuce wraps - heavy on the large water chestnut pieces.
Most likely won't be back unless someone else insists."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and service is as well. The happy hour menu is excellent there are lots of good options so that you can try out the food at a lower price."}
{"text":"I have a policy to not eat at chain restaurants as food is typically average at best, uninspired, and with so many locally owned options, not needed.  After my dinner here, that policy has been reaffirmed. Hungry and having a gift certificate, we threw caution to the wind and headed over for dinner. The bar was set low and still we left completely disappointed. Our waiter was not only disengaged (standing a few feet from the table and turning to walk away before he finished speaking) but also MIA for most of the meal. And when we were able to track him down, it took forever for him to return. Food wise, the meal was a hot mess.  Lettuce wraps with lettuce that was mostly white and gnarly. Sesame chicken that contained so much ginger we would've sworn they brought out the wrong dish expect for the sprinkling of sesame seeds on the plate. And wok seared brussel sprouts that tasted eerily reminiscent of lemon cake rendering the dish inedible. The biggest laugh we got was reading the menu slogan \"Farm to Wok\".  They surely can't be serious.  While I wasn't expecting greatness, P.F. Chang's didn't even deliver mediocrity."}
{"text":"This is a decent location but you will get less than stellar service if you are picking up. I had a large order that I picked up and they literally wrote it down on a coaster."}
{"text":"Heather amazing service !!!! She came to our table and had a great conversation with us !!!! You can tell she cares about connecting with guest. Our waiter was I think her name is Sherri Lee she was so on point professional great smile warm Aura!!! We dinned upstairs I'm a restaurant manager and I always see the details the manager on the floor (sat night ) created a nice environment you can tell the servers were relaxed. Food was the best I've ever eaten at a Changs The miso glazed salmon lobster roll and shrimp dumplings on point!!! Thank you guys!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's going on with their food, but my last visit here was awful! The orange shrimp was slimy, and the rice noodles in the noodle salad were crunchy. The brown rice was dry. The worst part, the chicken on my noodle salad was RAW in the middle. I discovered this after eating a piece. The manager came out and apologized but this meal was a total disaster."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and while I've had good experiences both times, it's just not all that great. The decor is interesting, the servers I've had have all been attentive and gave great service, and the food is always good. 

My real problem is that while the food is good, it tastes the same as my neighborhood take-out place. It's hard to rationalize spending $16 on sesame chicken that tastes the same as the $9 sesame chicken combo at the place around the corner. If the price is double, I'm expecting some miraculous-tasting chicken.

If I'm invited out with a group, I'll go again, but until that happens I'm sticking with Bei Jing Chinese."}
{"text":"My second time here was another awesome experience. The ambience of the restaurant is whats so perfect! Which is followed by there delicious beef & broccoli entree and egg drop soup. The lunch portion is 4oz of meat with broccoli and rice which was perfect with chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer. Our server was a very nice female who asked us about what we were doing for the holidays. She encouraged us to get desert and  we discovered that the raspberry cheesecake was awesome. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bad bad service!! We just walked out because the hostess gave us attitude for wanting a booth. 8/12/12 12:45pm"}
{"text":"I am huge fan of this chain, loved their food and presentation 

But my last visit to the Paradise Location was way shy of their normal standard

We arrived just after work for a quick drink and small bites at the bar. First time, at PF Chang, I noticed the bar was empty, normally its a super busy place. 

We ordered two Magic Hats and Dynamite Shrimps with Kung Poa Chicken. The food came out on  time, but for first time at PF Chang the chicken was uncooked and really hard. It is dangerous to serve uncooked chicken

Shared the experience with the manager in-charge and immediate action was taken, they did not charge me for that. 

I am really disappointed with my experience here, I will however be back and I hope this was  a one-off incident."}
{"text":"I love this PF Changs. I've always liked the food, but the customer service is fantastic! I recently ordered  to-go order and they even mixed up some of their special sauce. they were very courteous and placed the bag in my car for me. I've been blown away at their customer service every time I visit!"}
{"text":"Very disapointed with this location. Limited menu, lower quality food (dry rice) and super slow service. Not up to the high standards of the rest of the P.F. Chang chain."}
{"text":"As far as chain restaurants go, you can't go wrong with PF Changs. There's something for everyone. 

I've dined in the dining room and I've ordered curbside take out from this PFC. I've yet to be disappointed. They are fast, courteous and every so often I get an extra FREE surprise appetizer or dessert to taste. 

Located right off the freeway and there's plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I went to PF Changs about six months ago and there was an issue with the bar and I returned last night and waited almost 20 minutes and nobody came to my table i finally left and will never go there again , the service is horrible!!!!!"}
{"text":"PF Chang's has the best americanized chinese food. 
- wok charred beef is really good
- singapore street noodle is decent
- sauteed string beans are above average
- honey shrimp is pretty good 
- banana spring roll for dessert was great
- great wall of chocolate was sweeet :) 
- i came here with 6 other colleagues. we didn't know what each other's taste preference was and Chad (the waiter) did a great job advising us what to order."}
{"text":"The duck breast is pretty good, overall, this is a pretty good Chinese American restaurant."}
{"text":"Am i the only one for whom P.F. Chang's was ruined by one or more episodes of 'South Park'?  Actually, i'd never eaten at one until a recent trip to Vegas.  But all i could think of as i ate some chicken that attempted to make up for its lack of taste with absurdly unnecessary spiciness was what my couric output would be.  Disappointing in every regard."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and the food was to our liking, as usual. We love the shrimp fried rice with plum sauce on the side. The ginger sauce on the mixer plate though, will clear your nasal way if you have any issues. It's that strong! Lol. We sat outside since it was such a nice day and had entertainment as people walked by the guy covered in gold paint, posing as a statue & scaring people. The little birds were flying around and eating rice that fell on the ground (cute but a bit annoying). Our server was decent and wait time was minimal. Overall, it was good and we are likely to return."}
{"text":"After living less than a mile away from this PF Chang's for more than two years, we finally tried it for takeout last Tuesday. I am not a huge fan of Chinese food, and not a huge fan of chains, so though I have lived near other locations in many cities, it has never been high on my list of places to try!

I was actually pleasantly surprised. I had wonton soup, steamed pork dumplings, and the chopped chicken salad. You get a choice of dressing with the salad - ginger or sesame. I had the sesame and it was to die for! I am going to check whether they sell this by the jar, and if so, I'll definitely buy some. The food wasn't anything amazing (I thought it was the same quality you get at any generic Chinese place), but perfectly fine.

I probably wouldn't go back and eat in the actual restaurant, just because of the generic chain feel of the place. But the pick-up at the bar was easy, the staff was friendly, and it was pretty decent Chinese takeout. I'll definitely do it again!"}
{"text":"We go to this pf changs pretty often because it is my favorite restaurant.  They have always been very great service,  the food comes out fast and it is all so delicious.  Also make sure you get the reward card because it's worth it you can get free appetizers and entrees.  If you like Chinese food,  this is a great place to go.  The lettuce wraps are the best!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed the very last time I went here. And it made my guts feel funny =[ not cool...thank goodness it was not a date."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and can't eat gluten so this was my place to go more than once. The service here is fantastic! Everyone was so great with answering questions about ingredients, making recommendations, or checking with the kitchen if they didn't have the answer themselves. Our waitress had a great sense of humor and was responsive without hovering. Our food was fantastic! I would be eating here whether gluten free or not. The flourless chocolate dome is dreamy."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed in this place.
They are always so busy, it takes forever to get a table.
But what really upset me is the time I called in a to-go order on a Sun night around 7 pm. When I called in the order, they said it would take 25 min. 
So when I arrived at the restaurant 25 min later, (btw I waited by the to-go register for at least 5 min without even being acknowledge by any of the staff) I was told that the order just went in and it would take another 40 min. So I just cancelled my order and walked out.
If they would've just told me on the phone when I called in order that it would take an hour, I would've been ok with that. I could've waited at home for an hour doing something worthwhile instead of wasting my time waiting at the restaurant. But they lied and said it would only take 25 min.
It's too bad their service is horrible because I like their food.
I will NOT be going here again."}
{"text":"I remember why I don't like chains.

P.F. Chang's is supposed to be great chinese food that doesn't taste like it was made in 5 minutes.  I'm pretty sure everything comes from some warehouse frozen and the \"cooks\" just heat it up.  It feels like I'm spending way too much for a Lean Cuisine meal someone else microwaved for me.

Not to mention, our waiter acted like we were a bother to order food and drink.  I do believe that is the last time I will be found in a P.F. CHang's.

Oh, and why do they put those giant horse statues out front if the don't want you to ride them?"}
{"text":"PF Chang's is usually a great place to go with quality friends and enjoy as delicious meal. The location, as stated by Penny Lane, has the worst service. We ate in the bar, and while waiting 30 minutes for our entrees, we witnessed a BF by the bar tender and four tables come and go around us. Our food was cold and the sauces were congealed. \"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant and love Sean, the waiter.

I've been to other PFC's in the past but there's just something special about the hospitality, location and food in this one. You'll need to try it to believe it."}
{"text":"Boyfriend got a gift card here so we decided to go. We've both been before, but never really had the desire to come back at any point. 

Service was very strange and awkward. Walked in and got a strange vibe. Barely friendly, very much to the point. \"Have you picked the entrees you want?\"  Our server had lots of facial hair and we would watch him touch his beard and put chapstick on in the back, but never saw him wash his hands. That grossed us out.

The food wasn't bad, we both ended up full but it's definitely not authentic chinese. I remember coming here after a trip to China and having been disappointed I never came back. Either way it filled us up but it wasn't anything special.

I feel like this place tries so hard to pass off as elegant and what not, but I just wasn't getting that from this experience. Hardly friendly people, without good sanitation practices, with over priced entrees that you could somewhere else with larger portions for a cheaper price.  

Safe to say my boyfriend and I left disappointed and agreed that we wouldn't ever come back. I don't get why other people would get so excited about coming here. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I have been to this location maybe 3 times in the last 4 years; PF Changs is just okay to me.

I went to this location for lunch with some co-workers yesterday.  Before taking our order, the waiter advises us to try things that sound gross because he says things that sound gross for Chinese food are good, and things that sound good we will send back to the kitchen.  ????  

I order some Moo Goo Pai chicken and shrimp.  He asked me if I ordered that because it sounded good.  ????  

I told him of course I did, why else would I order it.  He told me that it was bland ?????  

I told him that would be fine.

He was correct, it was bland, but nothing a little chili oil they have on the table could not solve.  

Nice lunch specials here...it does not join the rotation for lunch but it might be good to go here once and a while; the server may be entertaining."}
{"text":"This last visit, we made reservations for 8pm for a party of 10, celebrating a birthday. The restaurant was about 3/4 full, yet they didnt seat us until 8:15pm. The hostesses were rather apathetic about the whole thing, and were saying we just needed to wait for people to leave, instead of them pushing some open tables together.

Our server was great, but a bit overwhelmed by himself doing a table of 10, which is understandable. It took 1hr 15min for our entrees to all come out. This was frustrating since by the time our food came out, the restaurant was about 1/3 full... so this wasnt at a peak time. 

I wasnt going to complain, since we were just trying to have a good birthday, and were just gonna chalk this up to a off night in the kitchen. But this changed when the manager came by and asked us how our night had been. When I told her the food was good, but it took an 1hr 15min for us to all get our entrees, she decided to tell me I was wrong. I told her about our late seating even though we had a reservation, and she proceeded to tell me I was wrong about that as well, saying we were sat at 8:07pm. She then argued that since we ordered appetizers... which took forever to come out as well, that was why our food was late. I told her that since she knew all the answers, and that I was obviously just lying to her, that I didnt understand why she even asked us how our service was.

They comped our table 3 small desserts as a way to remedy the situation... Which was underwhelming. I feel for our waiter, because the manager seemed to give him a hard time, which we made sure to clarify he did nothing wrong.

Long story short... The management doesnt understand the definition of customer service. The food is good though, but its not worth going back to. Plenty of other places that we will have birthdays and large gatherings at."}
{"text":"Had the long noodle prawn dish and it was amazing.. the shrimp was cooked perfectly which is a rarity in AZ. Our server Torey was on point also!"}
{"text":"Love, love this place. Ambiance is always very intimate but casual enough where if you're with your entire family or mom you don't feel out of place. 

All waitstaff are extremely friendly and attentive, which I look for when dining out. 

I went here with my 4 month old and mother. We had a table of four, but only needed three seats as they were more than willing to move the 4th chair for the stroller space.  As soon as we sat down, our waiter was there to take our drink order. 

We got the 2 for $40 and tried a few different things. The lettuce wraps are delicious. They don't usually come with a dipping sauce or anything, but it's really not needed. For entrees, we got Honey Crispy Shrimp and Spicy Scallops. Both were awesome.  The only reason we didn't eat all at one time was to save some for next time.  

Overall, great dining experience. For an affordable, intimate, semi-formal date night, this is a good option."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. Poor service and the menu changes are not exactly to my taste either.  I will not be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"We were two of the four sitting at bat.  We ordered our food came but it was not good.  My friend ordered a beer he did not receive . We were not noticed at all after we received our food. I wanted a refill of tea and of course still no first beer  my friend ordered. 
The food was salty cold and just not good .felt like the food was not fresh at all.  Like maybe was from the night or days before."}
{"text":"This was actually my very first visit to a P.F. Chang's, if you can believe that.  We didn't have many in Wisconsin where I resided for the last 11 years before uprooting to Arizona.  We came here this evening to celebrate my dad-in-law's birthday and it was his choice.  And a good one at that.

The location is right off I-17 & Happy Valley smack dab in the middle of everything.  Plenty of ample parking.  Considering it was dinner time on a Saturday, I was pleasantly surprised to see they seated our party of 4 immediately.  The restaurant location is clean but I was a bit surprised to see how dimly lit it was.  Not necessarily a bad thing at all, just a bit surprised.  There is candlelight at each table that lets you know, this ain't no Panda Express.  We were greeted practically instantaneously by our server (Jocelyn) who took our drink orders promptly.  I opted for a Diet Coke and before I go on, let me just say that my glass of Diet Coke never went empty.  I mean, never.  This is a big deal for me at any restaurant with sit down-service, especially if I order a soda or iced tea.  So... kudos to her!  Back to the restaurant... plenty of cool Asian-themed decor with a modern and contemporary twist to it.  Very clean and well kept.  The restrooms were of equal condition and also quite clean.  The employees were friendly, polite and welcoming.

We started with a spicy tuna roll and honestly, this was probably the most lackluster part of the meal.  It was good, not great, but I'll cut them some slack because they're a well-known Chinese restaurant, not a Japanese restaurant.  It isn't that it wasn't fresh, it just wasn't what I would expect from a spicy tuna roll.  The rice was \"crumbly\" unlike what good sushi rice should do.  The tuna was balled up and just sort of lying within this roll of rice.  Not much for presentation as you can gather by the photo I took.  There are really only 4-5 rolls on the entire menu so that alone tells you they don't expect to be known for their sushi... and rightfully so.  Obviously, I've had 1,000x times better, but again, its a Chinese chain restaurant, not a sushi bar.  You wouldn't go to a sushi bar to order Beef Broccoli, would you?  ...that's what I thought.  My in-laws ordered the lettuce wrap with chicken.  Fresh, crisp, cool iceberg lettuce which you essentially use to wrap up this hot, flavorful, chicken-garlic concoction.  Interesting... and delicious!

For my entree, I opted for the Long Life Noodles with Prawns.  It's a hefty bowl that really doesn't appear all that hefty, but holy cow... it left me stuffed, but not to the point where I felt miserable.  So anywho, the bowl is chock full of delicious rice noodles & crispy prawn tails.  I'm no noodle connoisseur, but they were not soggy and they were cooked all of the way through.  They had the consistency of a spaghetti noodle, but not quite so noodle-y (I just made that word up.  No, you can't steal it.)  The entire dish is flavorful as chili peppers are abundant throughout the dish as is plenty of garlic.  The prawn tails were crispy and awesome.  It's so easy to overcook them, but the ones I had in my bowl 'o noodles were cooked to perfection.  

I'm a bit dismayed and somewhat surprised to see so many negative reviews about this particular location.  Perhaps we caught a lucky evening here at P.F Chang's but our service was phenomenal.  In fact, I honestly don't know how our service could have possibly been any better?  We walked in and were seated immediately.  Our drink order was placed immediately.  We were checked on constantly.  Our glasses never went empty.  Our appetizers and entrees came out to our table immediately (and accurately).  When we asked for the check, it was delivered promptly.  Based on all of that and as I previously mentioned, I'm not quite sure how the service could've possibly been any better?  The only downfall that I could possibly see the pricing, but I think it goes without saying that they are trying their best to be a slightly more upscale Asian restaurant.  My dish was $15 and some change which I think is on-par with any other seafood dish at a restaurant with sit-down service.  I'm giving them a solid 4-stars, taking the rest of my noodles and going home."}
{"text":"The hubby and I stopped in for a quick bite. The place was buzzing since it was dinner time so we opted to sit at the bar. Service was okay, nothing overly jubilant, just forgettable. Bartender was a bit stoic and robotic but very attentive. 

Back home we used to joke that P.F. Changs was the only Chinese restaurant in Scottsdale because it's always always crowded.  They do serve quality food and drinks and offer a gluten free menu and terrific drink options.  Full bar, beer and my latest discovery...strawberry and cucumber non-alcoholic refresher! Wow! During the hot summer scorching days this will cool you off so order one!

We also snacked on Edamame, Lettuce Wraps, Lemon Scallops and a side dish of stir fried Asparagus.  All winners! We usually always get the scallops which by the way aren't even on the menu but because they're fabulous P.F. Changs they whip it up for us every time.

Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"PF Chang's is always predictable if you're a regular and have some items that you always stick to or just come to get that special dish. We stopped in for Father's Day during a late lunch hour.  Service was friendly but a bit sluggish for a not-so-full dining room.  Nonetheless the food never disappoints.

For us, starters always include their \"famous\" lettuce wraps-yummy, crunchy \"tacos\" without the guilt and full of flavor.  Next on our repertoire are the Lemon Scallops-you won't find these on the menu but if you have a seasoned waiter you should have no problem ordering these-I gave them an extra star for this special request granted.

Another favorite during the summertime heat blazing hours of the day is ordering a refreshing strawberry cooler-not sure this is the exact name but it sounds good to me.  It's a mix of fresh sliced strawberries, cucumbers, mint, sparkling water and some sweet simple syrup. AAAAahhhh. Yum yum will go your tum-tum.

Conveniently located near the airport."}
{"text":"Continuing a tradition my husband and I started 5 years ago, we went to PF Changs for New Year's Eve dinner. We've been going to this location off and on for the past 7 years or so and always liked it, but things seem to be changing. 
We unfortunately made reservations only the day before NYE so our options were limited. We chose the 9:45pm option because the alternative (5:00!) would have been weird. We thought that, given the time we were forced to take we'd walk into the restaurant and it would be packed! Nope, got there, no one there.. you know what was also not there? Any record of our reservation. So, we put our name in (and our request for a booth), took our buzzer and took a seat the bar. Fast forward to 45 min later, MANY booths open, some even taken by new customers coming in.. and we finally went up to the hostess and asked what was going on. Get this.. she thought we had left. She claims she buzzed us and we never responded. Yes, we are at the practically empty bar which is like 10 feet from the hostess stand, with NO ONE in the waiting area... and she lost us. SIGH. So fine, we got our booth and sat down. Let me say at this point that our waiter was very nice and attentive even though he had obviously had a long, long day. We appreciated that. However here is where my real complaints come in- the food. Why must restaurants decide that they are going to change things. Who goes to chain restaurants and thinks \"I LOVE this place, but what I'd really love is if they changed everything!\"  NOPE. People go because they like what they have there. They like the safety of choosing the same dish over and over and loving it! PF Changs has decided to get rid of items on their menu (no more veggie dumplings!), make some things smaller, and take away fun little things like the mixing of the sauce at the table. Plus, a big downer for me, they've renovated the restaurants so that they are more cluttered and BRIGHTER. I loved the cozy dark atmosphere!! It seemed different and a class higher than most chain restaurants. I have no idea why they MUST mess up a good thing. 
The food tasted ok - though by the end of the night, because it was well past closing (perhaps that lovely 45 min wait we had), we couldn't even have dessert because the kitchen had closed. Sigh. I think we are done with our PF Changs NYE tradition. Sad."}
{"text":"\" One of the Best P.F. Chang's I Have Visited \" 

My wife and I visited the P.F. Chang's in Peoria Arizona, which is across the street from the Peoria Sports Complex. We went to watch the San Diego Padres and Seattle Mariners play baseball, and went to have dinner after the game around 4:30 pm. We were greeted by the Manager Gideon Swanson, and taken to our table by our server Troy Grassmeyer. Troy was an outstanding server with a big smile on his face, as he came back many times to make sure our wants and needs were taken care of. Troy was professional, very nice, and really cared about the service he gave us. The Manager Gideon Swanson, came by our table to see how our dinner was going, and was very nice and pleasant to talk too. The restaurant food quality compared to other P.F. Chang's we have visited was Outstanding ! We had the Chicken  lettuce wraps appetizer with Sesame Chicken, and Honey Chicken Dinners. The Dinners were spot on and delicious ! All in All, this P.F. Chang's in Peoria has a great Manager and Servers, combined with a great indoor atmosphere, which made our dinning experience Outstanding !"}
{"text":"Ok Nicole was awesome.  We love PF Chang but the Planet Hollywood one is just not up to our expectation. That said we decided to go off the beaten path and go to the PF Chang off Paradise.  Besides the food being everthing you expect it to be, the service was exemplary - Nicole made a really delicious dinner even more delicious."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just ate here this was my first time eating at PF Changs but I had heard very good things about this restaurant. Starting with the service the server did not ever tell me his name I am also a waitress so I expected good service to begin with he was very quiet and when we did receive our food he never came back to ask how it was he was not very attentive at all however we both work in the service industry so we decided to give the food a chance since that's what we had come here for. My girlfriend got an appetizer of the edamame and the fried green beans the edamame was very Bland and needed seasoning the green beans were not spectacular although she did say that she enjoyed the sauce. for entrees I had the sweet and sour chicken I have had sweet and sour chicken from several other Chinese restaurants including take out and I was very displeased with the sauce and the poportion I've had better for cheaper. My girlfriend had the chicken fried rice which was fine but it's also a very easy dish overall we rated this restaurant with one star because we did not even care to stay for dessert even though the desert did look appetizing. I am pretty disappointed in my first experience I don't think that I will return again but you never know"}
{"text":"Excellent service and yummy yummy food!  Matt gives great service too.  Everyone seems to always be smiling!"}
{"text":"We orders takeout last weekend and it was terribly disappointing.

The crab wontons were more wonton than crab, pretty average at best.   The crispy honey chicken was mushy and flavorless, as was the shrimp and honeydew we orderd.   The beef a la Sichuan was excellent though.

Our total for 3 dishes and one appetizer was almost $70 for a takeout meal that was really subpar."}
{"text":"I'm not surprised at how many people think this place is good.  It's really not.  It's like saying Olive Garden is good italian food.  Seriously.  It's okay.  The best thing about it, is that it's a chain and you know what you're going to get.

I prefer and suggest Bamboo club over this place....or if you REALLY want Chang's, go to Pei Wei.  Same food, cheaper price."}
{"text":"I went in at 5PM and was told there is a 3 and a half hour wait for 5 people. It's not even that busy! And the girl was very rude! Very unhappy !!"}
{"text":"It's been years since I've been to a PF Chang's and it's safe to say I won't be returning. The food was very salty and the only redeeming factor was the manager granted us gift cards to make up for some poor tasting food they like to call 'cuisine.' If only we could have applied the gift cards to our tab since we don't plan on ever returning..."}
{"text":"Took my grandmother here for her bday atmosphere is really nice food is good you just have to know what to order I love the desserts as well"}
{"text":"I have been visiting the PF Chang's at the Kierland location for a few years now. I return because of one person in particular, the manager, Lexi.
I met her when she was behind the bar and watched her work hard to achieve her promotion.

She is the single most pleasant person I've met in the service business . She is and always has been a shining light and I will always visit knowing she's there."}
{"text":"We just walked out of this location due to terrible service. After being seated we waited over 15 min and a waiter never came to our table. It made no sense. The place was EMPTY!!!! There is no reason we shouldn't have seen someone in the amount of time we sat there. While we were walking out we noticed the staff horse-playing in the back. Makes sense why no one could make the time to come take our order. Terrible experience!!!!"}
{"text":"No longer a fan. The last three times we've been here to food has been sub par. Today honey crispy chicken was bland, I subbed tofu for the changes chicken and got oil soaked liquid centered squares. We took our leftovers and threw them out on the way home. Franchise fail. Service was great and the hot and sour soup was great. I'll spare you the details of the aftermath, but it wasn't pretty."}
{"text":"We ordered some wonton soup for late night snack. But the wonton doesn't taste fresh. The wonton skin is very sticky (which means it must came from the freezer) and wasn't handled right. Same with the noodle we ordered, the noodle is too sticky too. (Believe me, we come from China.)

The service was good. But you need to step it up, PF Chang!"}
{"text":"After waiting 5 minutes for a hostess to appear, we we escorted to the spot where it all went down. 

I reminisced over meals years ago when plates of hot and tasty food were served in sister restaurants around the states... then:

Calamari: was lukewarm and tasted like fish sticks. Enough said. 

Rice: was dry and al dente... at an asian restaurant.

Orange peel shrimp: was the best dish, owing to its sugary sauce and only being slightly overcooked. The the orange rind tasted the opposite of fresh... I literally imagined oranges in a pile of two-day old trash being scooped up by the cook. It wasn't nearly as good as the same dish a couple years ago at another Changs.

Mongolian beef: tasted like shards of a tire. The green onions were offensive, inedible and awkward.

Ginger ale: watered down.

Desserts: in my haste to depart, I ordered the one dish I could remember: mini-desserts, aka, sweet baby food for adults. One or two layers of this crap actually tasted edible, if only in small concurrent quantities.

This spot reflects on Americans' taste in food the way the WCW... u get the idea. Quality of all chain restaurants seems to experience the same sad decline that has befallen applebees, the olive garden, et al.--which threw quality under the bus for profit margins. 

The next time I crave a cheap and decent chain-y meal, I'll drive my bourgeoisie romp to the Cheesecake Factory or Ri Ra."}
{"text":"After an afternoon of shopping and craving Chinese food one does not get better than PF Chang's. Met up with a few friends for drinks at the bar and the bar here is very great for doing that. We started with Coors light and ended with some sake. The sake here has no after taste as most of the others that I have tried. Paired with there fantastic egg rolls makes for a great selection.

After our gathering upon friends and catching up who wants to cook so decided that take out from here would be great and my twins need to eat too. So took home the beef fried rice and veggie fried rice. On the veggie rice they even substituted extra broccoli for bean sprouts. The food was excellent and they even include in the take home food plates and fortune cookies. As always the service was impeccable while ate here and the love that they put into preparing and packing my food."}
{"text":"PF Changs, salt and pepper calamari, chicken lettuce wraps, home made egg rolls, lo mein, fried rice, beef with broccoli, egg drop soup, and hot & sour soup are good. The bbq ribs are ok. The chicken noodle soup is my favorite. Nice decore and atmosphere. Clean."}
{"text":"The server took no joke an hour to bring our food out and messed the order up two times! Ended up paying 45 dollars for two beers. Never coming to this location again!"}
{"text":"I can not express my gratitude enough for the staff here. I placed a large takeout order late at night and got there right before they closed. As I arrived to pick it up, I realized I had forgotten my wallet. After trying to find anyway to pay for my order, I was unable to. As someone who also works in the restaurant industry, I felt horrible. The manager Amanda was kind enough to go ahead and give the order to me free of charge. 

I'm heading back there today to give them a hefty tip for their kindness."}
{"text":"My vegan friend, Deb, turned me onto the fact that one can dine at PF Chang's and stay on a vegan diet.

Vegan friend Deb (VFD) asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps. The waitress without hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version, but it was never put on the menu.
Warning: even though it's vegan, it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt, fat, and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public. The vegan version is just as delicious and the chicken.

They also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic, eggplant and garlic, and a few dishes with tofu and vegetables.

I always loved the fact PF Chang's offered brown rice. That nutty flavor goes so well with their meals.

The service staff at Chang's is always top shelf, I've never had a bad time here and love when we go."}
{"text":"I have tried, numerous times, to like this place.  I don't know why, but it is some kind of odd pursuit of mine. 

Oh, I have failed thus far.

There is one thing I've had that is any good there, and it is the lettuce wraps.  

The entrees, however, are really lacking.  The orange beef is perfectly uniform chunks of beef in an orange flavored syrup.  Your choice of rice.  It's just horribly unimaginative, and the dish is too reliant on sugar and salt.

In a fit of attempted healthiness, I ordered the brown rice, and it had clearly been reheated.  You know when the little rice nuggets (yes, grains, I know) repel each other the next day?  That is what it felt like.  I've cooked brown rice at home in my steamer before and not had this problem.

I'd much rather get Chinese takeout from a local, immigrant-owned place that offers food of a similar or even better quality, for half the price, and none of the pretense."}
{"text":"Come here all the time and very consistent and good. Take out is always on point and the food quality has gone up. Of your looking for consistent good decent quality Chinese food without MsG this is your place."}
{"text":"From opening night at Fashion Square Mall, I have always loved PF Chang's. Yep I was There on the 1st night of operation at Unit 1, for this now mega chain.

For years PF Chang's remained an exciting destination to dine, I remember the crowds and the throngs of ever present managers and chefs working hard and diligent to keep things humming and on point.

Even as the chain grew there was still plenty of excitement in other cities across america. Replication was working and millions of Americans were introduced to skillfully prepared Chinese dishes.

Last week I returned and was dining alone on a mid week night around 7 pm. I knew when entering that the magic has gone, as the restaurant was merely at about 15-20% capacity. and a completely empty bar.

Welcomes and seating was swift so why complain, I'm not. Service was swift and pleasant. and the food was... Well the food has changed. One of my lifetime favorite restaurant appetizers has been rethought and er... remastered. The Chicken lettuce wraps tasted fine, as a mater of fact they tasted just like every other restaurants that strive to duplicate this appetizer. Diced chicken, not ground and the mushrooms although present they are now flavorless, The crispy white noodle could fit in a small childs hand, Then the Lettuce cups Hmmmn the care on serving 5 perfect cups in the past, well I got some lettuce. Then there was the sauce on the side you remember the soy, sambal and vinegar you composed at the table well that doesn't happen anymore. Its pre-made and in a little cup. take it or leave it as my server had no idea what I was talking about. 

I also ordered some chicken egg rolls, what the heck? these would have never made the original menu. They arrived hot and crisp on a small side plate with sauce, but no garnish, and worst yet they were cut in half ?!?!? but why?!?!?! why cut an eggroll??? perceived value?!?! 
 
I passed on the dessert mini's. I didn't have the heart to eat from a shot glass.

Gotta do what you gotta do, but with a dining room at 20 percent at 7 pm What did you Do?!?!?!"}
{"text":"I have dined here many times since I live nearby but no more.   The first thing you notice about this place when you walk in are dirty tables.   I don't know if they don't hire bus people but the place always looks filthy.   Second, the food is always EXTREMELY greasy.   They are way too heavy handed with the oils when they cook.   I always have a stomach ache when leaving.   The beef is so chewy you have to spit out half your meal since it is inedible.  Third, service is awful.   Non attentive and they don't know the menu too well.   When you ask a server a question about a specific food item they never know the answer.  Management rude.   I signed up to be on the e-mail list.  They sent me a promotional coupon which I used.  About three weeks later they sent another coupon.   I tried to use that one but the manager told me I already used it.   Why would they send me out another coupon if I already used it?  Especially three weeks later?   I cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time in ages & made me sad that I haven't been in a while, it was quite good. We had 8 of us + a baby & the service was great. The menu has changed since I last been in. All of our entrees & apps were very good. The ONE mishap we had was someone in the group ordered a \"martini on the rocks\" & it came back with no \"rocks\". And when we asked why it wasn't on the rocks, she said \"yes it is\". We later learned that she was new, and it was her first week on the job, so we told her rocks means ice :) Not a big deal though!!"}
{"text":"A two story pf changs with a bar on both levels.
Bartenders make you feel at home with awesome service. The food is genuinely good."}
{"text":"Great food - outstanding service.  A little hard to find parking at the Scottsdale location"}
{"text":"It's PF Changs hello! One of my favorite restaurants. We eat here at least once a month, food and service are always great. Wanton soup, and lettuce wraps to start. Changs spicy chicken, salt and pepper prawns are two of my favorites."}
{"text":"After living in America for 4 years, I finally got to go and eat at PF Chang's. I was very excited and surprised by the modern decor and ambiance. We were a party of three and got seated after a short five minute wait. 

We quickly agreed on sharing the chicken spring roll appetizer, which was an excellent choice and the perfect starter to share. The sauces that come with the dish are all very tasty, my favorite was the horse radish sauce.

Then we ordered three meals family style: the Korean bbq chicken, the glazed shrimp, and a beef and vegetable dish. I wasn't impressed by the Korean bbq chicken and mainly because it had nothing to do with Korean bbq. The chicken pieces were battered and fried and there was no Korean taste in the dish. Don't give me wrong, it wasn't bad, but they should call it something else to avoid confusion. 

The shrimp and the beef dish were really good, but I feel like nothing really tasted authentic. If you go there, you probably do so for the vibe and to pay a little more, and not to eat authentic food, so set your expectations accordingly. 

I still really enjoyed myself and will probably be back for a more fancier Asian meal experience."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this PF Changs 2 other times.  Reviews not written back then because they were all pre-Yelp.  One thing consistent with both experiences was the long wait.  And because Pei Wei (aka their baby cousin) taste pretty much the same, I never made my way back here. 

Well, my most recent visit was for a friend's wedding celebration.  Congratulations Jenny on wedding number #3.  I know we joke about it.  3 times a charm!!

Couple of things to point out first;
1.  We had the whole upper level to ourselves
2.  The food was served buffet style
3.  Great view of the strip from our dining area

I actually liked the fact that we had the whole upstairs to ourselves.  This meant we can all enjoy the celebration without worrying about other patrons.  I knew I was eating cake later and having a couple of drinks, so I didn't take full advantage of the buffet.  I kept it to one plate.  I had their chicken lettuce wraps and their beef with broccoli.  There was a bunch of other usual's at the buffet (i.e. noodles, meins, rice, and wontons).  

The food here is always consistent. I'm still a fan of the food, just not a huge fan because the wait here always seems to take a long time.  I also spent some time at the bar catching up with friends. I had a few drinks.  The bartenders and waitresses were all efficient, at least with me.  One of my friends felt slided a little since her drinks always took forever or forgotten while mine were always right on.  All this did was just remind me about the service or lack of at the location.  But in the end, I'm not complaining because we were celebrating one of my closest friend's wedding, the food was free, and the drinks kept me happy.  


PS:  Some of the other guests thought that the service was worth 2 stars and would have written a review if they Yelped.  While some thought it was a solid 4 stars.  I guess it comes down to the individual who's reviewing this place.  For me, I think 3 stars is just about right.

{"text":"Not normally one to review chains, but since I was in an area that I was unfamilar with I figured it would be worth it.  Nothing like driving 9 hours to watch your New England Patriots beat the Steelers with just little time remaining.  It was a long day and my dad and I were looking for something we wouldn't be dissapointed with.  I had never been to a P. Chang's before; although, there is one near my house.  We were orginally going to get takeout, but then decided to eat there instead.  It was a Sunday evening and we were seating right away. My dad and I ordered a drink and then ordered the seasame chicken entree and the honey chicken entree.  Honestly, I thought it was very good and the portion size was just right.  I was expecting some commericalized chinese food that would taste subpar, but that was not the case. I was shocked that it tasted so good and I think I will have to check out the location near my house in the near future.  THe place was clean and the service was very good, but overall the menu items are expensive.  For a basic combo meal without an egg roll I thought the meal total was expensive for just two people.  I can go to local chinese resturatns and get bigger portions for a cheaper price and that is the one downfall of this place.  If money really isn't a factor though, you won't be disspaointed with the food here."}
{"text":"The quality and kind has declined over the years. It's not worth the price anymore. i'm not going back - no reason to return."}
{"text":"This is one of our comfort food places. I've been enjoying the Mongolian Beef for years :) Regardless of what you order, this is a solid place for both lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"This has been my second time ordering and picking up food from this location and both times the hostess and girls up front have disregard my order. I don't understand why everything I place an order I still have to wait 20 minutes when I arrive. So both times it seems as if my order was made after I arrived. Also this last pickup the black girl with the red lipstick was calling out for carry out orders. I sat and saw she put an order on the counter. I figured my order was not ready, however 10 minutes later the hostess looked on the counter at the same order that was placed there earlier and called my name. I was so mad, I took my order and left!! This was unacceptable and I definitely would not recommend anyone else eating here. Very annoying experience!"}
{"text":"If you were a fan a few years ago then you'll know the difference in quality of food. It's very dissapointing they cut corners and serve Panda Express level dishes. We took many groups of friends and we all agreed we won't return after eating at two different restaurants here and the one in Newport we had frequented since 2000. Step it back up! Now your business is from the senior citizens that don't know the difference."}
{"text":"This is one of PF Chang's top restaurants!! Great service awaits you at this location each and every visit. We even book our annual night before Super Bowl dinner here for over 30 friends and these guys rock it every time!!  Excellent management, great servers and bar staff!  My favorite PF Chang's in the country. I strongly recommend reservations!! Also for large parties though do have 2 private dining rooms available!  I highly recommend both."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Chinese food! I had the Ma Pa Tofu which was very salty but still pretty good. My boyfriend had the egg rolls and the chaing mai chicken which I think he really enjoyed. Overall my only complaint was that the food labeled as \"spicy\" was just really not spicy at all! More spice PF Changs! Our waiter was awesome, I wish I remembered his name"}
{"text":"I've invented an invisibility formula. Sort of. 

From now on whenever I don't want to be seen or talked to I'm going to go to the P. F. Chang's at Planet Hollywood in Vegas. My wife and I were shown to a table fairly quickly, which was good. But I was convinced that we were going to witness the second coming of Christ before a server approached our table. This was bad. We had just been book shopping before coming in here and I was thinking that maybe I had time to read my new book before we were waited on. I could have written one.

A waiter, suddenly remembering that he had a job, finally came to our table and thanked us for our patience. There was no apology offered for our wait. Just an 'Atta boy' for hanging in there. He asked if he could start us off with some drinks but since we already had an eon to stare at the menu we were able to give our full order right away. I ordered the Chang's Spicy Chicken because there's nothing like sweet & spicy chili sauce when you're feeling ill-tempered. I didn't even bother to take a picture of my food to go along with this review. So if you've never seen what spicy chicken looks like - or a bottle of Budweiser, than I'm sorry to disappoint. But whenever I can't give you a picture - I WILL give you a thousand words.

Everything started to proceed somewhat swimmingly from here -  and 'swimmingly' isn't a word I use very often so that's a testament to how much better things really were going. We got our food pretty quickly and it was good. The waiter even came by asking if he could get me another beer. He was probably trying to get me drunk in hopes that it would increase his chances of getting a decent tip (didn't happen).

Then the invisibility formula kicked in again and we could no longer be seen or heard for another extended period of time. My wife asked if I wanted to get dessert but I was worried that might take another eight hours. I just wanted to pay the bill (or the 'check' as Americans so charmingly call it) and get out. We were finally able to get the waiter's attention and hand him our credit card. He disappeared without a trace for about ten minutes or so. I was starting to think that they truly didn't want us to leave. This must be how Henley and Frey felt when they wrote \"Hotel California.\" And Don Felder too. A staff member eventually approached us and said that their credit card machine was down and that they were waiting for it to come back online. Later on it did. And we left - never to return.

\"Hotel California\" has always been a work of mystery with no one truly knowing what the lyrics are really about. I do. Me, P. F. Chang, and I suspect - H. G. Wells. Along with Henley and Frey, of course. And Don Felder too."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment, really used to enjoy this place. Hostess was snotty, I'm guessing she was tired and over worked, it was indeed very busy. Waiter must've been new because he had trouble with taking our order.  Lettuce wraps finally arrived, and surprise-surprise the wonton soup followed 60 seconds afterwards. No sooner had first wrap been made and our entrees arrived. So entire meal within two minutes. Not surprisingly we ate cold entrees. Very disappointed dining experience, I can no longer recommend."}
{"text":"First, I would like to start out by saying when ordering from this restaurant you should eat there because the takeout portions pale in comparison, yet the prices are the same.  I got the chicken lo mein, pork dumplings, and beef and broccoli.  The pork dumplings did not have a good flavor or texture. The amount of dumplings that came in the order totaled out to be over a dollar each, and there was not much substance to them.  The chicken lo mein was very good, but a bit dry. The lo mein was probably the only dish that had a good price compared to the amount of food given. The beef and broccoli had a great flavor, but they try to trick you by loading the dish with broccoli and not a lot of meat.  I paid way to much money for the beef and broccoli dish for what they gave me.  The amount of sauce they gave was laughable, huge containers with a shake of sauce. If you have the time dine at the restaurant, the portions there seem to be a lot more than the takeout portions."}
{"text":"Tommy from Massachusetts was our server he did a great job I love PF Changs come to this location at least once a month and I realize I never left Yelp so here you go.


Came back and heather & Aaron at the bar were great"}
{"text":"He was my server he was super friendly I have a service animal with me for my disability and some servers frown on it not Keith he absolutely loved him and was such a joy to be our server.  Oh food always great here too 


Came back s fell in love with TAYLOR 


Came back 5/8/18 and wow who's the hostess ALI. So nice.   PF keep this one around"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Mai.  It was not tasty at all.  The noodles were too soft and they didn't add the extra green  onions like i requested.  I more thank likely will not return for any dish.  

The host was pleasant when I arrived to pick up the yucky food."}
{"text":"Went there with my lovely girl during a Las Vegas Vacation. We decided to sit outside and watch the people, this is a great location at the spot and overall a solid restaurant- as always. We had the sea bass with a soy broth (excellent) and the walnut shrimp which were good. Overall good place with an excellent location."}
{"text":"Mongolian Beef has always been one of my favorites here. Service is okay, but terribly slow.  They only have three chef's working in a busy restaurant on The Strip smh!"}
{"text":"First time to P.F. Changs!  Heard lots about this Resturaunt and it looked like it was going to be an awesome Resturaunt. I'm not impressed. The Resturaunt was not busy and it lacked any kind of cool feel. I was expecting something more upscale. Service was slow and sub par. 

Ordered the Mongolian beef and it was over done and did not have much flavour. Also had the lobster fried rice. It was ok. Nothing special. Had to add chili oil to try and give it life. Unfortunately it wasn't until almost finishing the meal that the waitress checked on us and then we were able to request. We were left wondering where our waitress had gone for most of the dining experience.
 
Not sure if they just had an off night but I really can't see how a chain was born out of this stuff. 

I'd say it would have been ok for take out or something. Not for a dining experience. Maybe I was expecting the wrong thing. Oh well at least I got to try it."}
{"text":"The food was hot, but extremely greasy..the Thai Pad was like eating over cooked spaghetti ..the Szechuan style asparagus was chopped in small pieces and swimming in grease. The kung pao chicken was the same..just couldn't eat it. Our bartender/server, Courtney was outstanding.. always smiling and checking on her customers while bartending for entire restaurant. The two hostesses were very gracious...but if u like greasy Asian style cuisine, this is your restaurant!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for happy hour. Excellent and attentive service. The small plate selections were excellent. You can't go wrong at PF Chang's."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for years! Every anniversary with my ex husband was spent at this location. Such great memories and even better food. If you go, ask to be seated in Memo's section. #1 server in my opinion!!"}
{"text":"Terrible! I ordered buddha's feast and it came as a bunch of vegetables with no sauce and no moisture. Awful."}
{"text":"Came in early evening with my family of 5 for dinner. We were seated right away in a booth. Our host and waiter were nice and helped us out the whole time. He was great at remembering our orders (we ordered a ton of food) and was quick with refills. 
The reason I gave 3 stars: the tables were still a little sticky and it's very crowded in there. It didn't affect my meal or comfort of the evening in any way but we heard two loud crashes and shattered plates and glasses, twice. That makes the employees and restaurant look bad. So my recommendation would be to make more room so that the guests and servers can actually walk around without bumping into people and/or dropping their food"}
{"text":"I come there about once a month.  However, dining inside is a 50/50 chance you're going to be frozen out.  They have the a/c going like the fridge is full and we need to keep some beef from spoiling that is outside of the freezer.  This is not a one-time experience but almost every time (during summer months that is).

The food - Well, they rotate a few things in and out on the menu but usually they are introducing things that are a complimentary item to the taste buds.  My wife gets garlic snap peas which I don't believe are currently on the menu as one of the available items, but they make it for her anyway.  I always enjoy the chicken lettuce wraps (and I think this is the place that really made them popular) and like their more recent additions of the sushi rolls as well.  In addition, the Kung Pao Chicken is delightful.  I always try to enjoy the egg drop soup but they are not consistent with the viscosity of the soup and sometimes it gets more like pudding than soup and when it gets like that, you can put green dye in it and it's the same as the kids toy \"slime\".  However, that's not all the time and for the most part - I like the food.

The Staff - Most of the time, they are great and no complaints there.

To Sum up - I like the food and the staff.  However, the place is busy at times and to get a seat where you freeze your butt off after waiting a while, that sucks (and no one does anything if you mention it).  If their sister company (Pei Wei) was closer to the house, I'd bypass going inside to dine altogether and just get the food there or to go as it's just as tasty in my opinion but obviously has a more limited menu selection."}
{"text":"My visit on March 13 was very disappointing. I have been to this restaurant since it opened. We were seated at a dirty table, my water glass was disgustingly dirty. Upon request our table was cleaned, but just a light swipe, still not cleaned. Menu had food stains on it....My Mongolian Beef was very tough and chewy, barely any sauce. My friend loved her Honey Chicken!
Service was very slow.....
Will give another chance, just once!"}
{"text":"Oh  no ! The food was very bland and offered not a drop of satisfaction for Asian fusion food. I went with my family and we were sorely disappointed that our food was tasteless and even our tea was brought out cold! Then when we asked to change our tea the waiter tried to convince us that it came out hot initially --my mind begins to wonder how it came out hot but came to us lukewarm. Anyway, I think this location needs a lot of work although I'm very grateful to the cook for working to serve us. Maybe he/she/they had a bad night?"}
{"text":"We ate here on Sunday night and every single one of us ended up extremely sick. We ordered the calamari appetizer, which is what I am assuming did the sick trick. It was the common denominator between us all. I have never had this experience at any other PF changs, so this is a real bummer because I LOVE their food. Because we don't know exactly which dish caused us to get sick, I won't be coming back to this location. We paid over 100 dollars just to get sick."}
{"text":"Great gluten free menu.  Great service.  Extra star for it being in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wasn't terrible,
But certainly wasn't great.
Save your hard-earned cash."}
{"text":"Not very busy, maybe 60% full.
Food is still good, although it arrived at the table Luke warm, and part of the order was forgotten and then delivered cold.  Service was pleasant but very slow. 
I have eaten in more than a dozen PF Chang's all over the west many many many times and this is the worst experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"Food was top notch and the service was outstanding . Love the spicy chicken and the lettuce wraps are the best"}
{"text":"Considering it is walking distance from the Drury Hotel this PF Chang's is one of the places I commonly visit when I am down in Charlotte on Business. The food is always good and the service is usually quick and friendly. It is good to go with a few people as sampling everything you can is a good thing. Would I go out of my way to visit any PF Chang's? No probably not, would I recommend this one if you are looking for some something in the area good to eat? Yes."}
{"text":"Service and food were excellent. We had just been at Bubba Gumps where we sat for 15 min in a half empty place before we finally walked out. Sergio at PF Changs was very attentive and our food arrived quickly. He was pleasant and an excellent waiter."}
{"text":"I visited this location this past Wednesday.  They were honoring one of their fantastic coupons!!!  If you sign up for the PF Change's preferred program, you get coupons.  I had the opportunity to visit the bar and I enjoyed the service from Gina.  It was a busy night and the service was still on point.  The food is decent!  I'm looking forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"P F Chang's is nothing new to me. Been there loved it many times. But for some reason it has never been this good in the past. Maybe me and my fiancé were just extra hungry. You would think for being one of there busiest locations the customer service would be on the slow side with the amount of traffic they are passing through. But I did not feel that at all. In fact it was better than it had ever been. Not to mention our waitress Rebecca was incredible and super friendly but not over baring. But most important the food was great."}
{"text":"Yeah so I'm doing a review on a chain restaurant,  which I don't normally like to do too much but I have to review the worse experience I've ever had here unfortunately.

I work at Planet Hollywood and frequently eat lunch at this location at least once a week.  Food is decent and service is usually pretty good and it's convenient from the offices that I work at upstairs.  Since I dine at this location regularly , I've signed up for the rewards program and once in a while get sent offers for buy an entree and get an entree free.   Since several of my co workers also get these offers we usually take advantage of this by ordering 2 entrees and getting the 2 free so a total of 4 entrees.  We know this is a lot of food but we're ok with having leftovers for lunch the next day.  For at least a year we have both been using our coupons and getting 2 full sized entrees with split checks between 2 people, there was also a time we did it with 3 people and 3 entrees.  All 3 people paid full price and received an additional entree free just as the coupon states.  We have never had an issue in the past year but for some reason a sever that I've never noticed before was so rude and condescending that he would not allow us to do it.  Once explained that we've been doing this for at least a year he was so snarky and said \"you get free lo Mein every time you come here?\"  I was annoyed by his rude and smart ass remark that I calmly said to him, \" no, we use our offers here every time we get them without a problem, whatever the offer at the time may be\".   To make a long story short, we were so annoyed by the way the server spoke to us that we decided to leave, when I called the manager she brushed me off and said she just walked into her shift and was just made aware if the situation but I'm ore then welcome to call back in about an hour to speak with the manager that was on duty.  I declined, I decided to write a comment to corporate through the main website with no response.  

It's very unfortunate that there are a lot of great servers at this location that we really like and never give us issues, but all it takes is one horrible experience to make me want to never return."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. It isn't what you'd call \"authentic\" asian cuisine, but it is good. There are a lot of nice flavors in the lo-mein, the lettuce wraps can't be beat for a light yet healthy meal, the prix-fixe menu is a great deal and the lunch bowls are offered seven days per week (perfect for those of us w/smaller appetittes). My only negative observation is the beef in the broccoli beef has been a bit chewy both times I've ordered this.

There is often a short wait for lunch and a long wait for dinner, so call ahead or try to grab a seat at the bar. The service has always been excellent. Get the preferred customer card for 10% off your bill (it's free and has unlimited use.)"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Stacy was fantastic. She took such good care of us and my baby, even bringing some grapes for him while waiting on his food. Very friendly and attentive! All the food was good and came out quick. I got the hot and sour soup and the chicken lettuce wraps. Hit the spot and would get again. Was nice to find a restaurant in the casino that didn't reek of smoke. Clean. Reasonable to a little pricey depending in the dish you ordered."}
{"text":"What a great place to go eat! I have been to a few PF changs in IN and IL was my first time in this location. Amazing service and we sat outside. Our waiter was super nice and helpful. I had the Mongolian beef and they made it spicy for me not sweet. I will be going back again ;)"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff. Chicken lettuce wraps are the best. Nice bar too!"}
{"text":"Lunch was excellent today. Nice redemption from our last visit, we are glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"Can't give 0 stars...
So it's Mother's Day and we did not have a reservation. The wait time quote was an hour 20 minutes. They sat us in an hour 45 minutes - not bad! I expected to wait 2 hours so technically they were early! So far so good. Until we got to our table. They had no high chairs so we had to wait. Luckily a guy (I think he was another waiter, not ours) hunted one down for us right away. Our waiter took our drink order and I ordered food for our 20 month old with our drinks. I asked for the toddler food right away. He came back with our drinks and we ordered 2 appetizers and 3 entrées - my husband told the waiter he could bring it all together. He said the appetizers and kids meal would be out shortly. I told him I really wanted the babies noodles right away. 20 minutes later our appetizers came out but no kids meal! The waiter avoided eye contact and came back a few minutes later with the kids meal. This is where I should say I worked in the service industry for over 10 years. I understand busy, I understand the kitchen getting 'under water' but the kitchen at this location should have been closed down until they caught up. Shortly after our baby meal (which now our stubborn toddler was overtired and hungry but refused to eat) arrived our waiter brought us an extra appetizer while we wait for the entrees. It wasn't anything we wanted but it was Mother's Day and I didn't want to be nasty, so I didn't say anything. I actually felt a little bad for our waiter, he was not in the 'swamped' zone and he needed to be. Our meal didn't arrive to our table until 1 1/2 hours after ordering. I kept bringing the 20 month old outside to walk around. I think at some point my husband talked to the manager. When our food arrived he stopped by our table for ONE second and said oh good the food arrived. Everybody's happy now. Wait! What?? I am not happy. The 20 month old is NOT happy. And he's hungry! And that's it? So our waiter had another 'extra' dish for us. Some beef something which we again didn't want but Mother's Day not wanting to be nasty in front of my toddler and in laws so I just ate my food and let my husband deal with getting boxes and paying etc. I don't know if he left a tip or not - it wasn't entirely the waiters fault. I heard the waiter at the table next to ours apologize to those customers and tell them they would get dessert. He handled the situation better - tip for our waiter: avoidance is not good customer service. I have worked on nights similar to this one ( to my Garden friends think Black Thursday) and I am proud how our whole restaurant handled it. I'm embarrassed for this PF Chang's and hope you take an opportunity to debrief what went well (the high chair hunter) and what went wrong (from the hostesses to the kitchen and especially the management) and figure out how to make it better. Moral - DO NOT go to this location in any traditionally busy holiday! Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"It's chang's so you know it's good...but there is something off about this one.  The food here is just so so and I'm speaking as a fan for years.  Example-Moscow mule ordered and it came in a glass.  The bartender said they had no copper mugs and that this was better...it wasn't.  Really-you can't float $40 for some copper mugs when you charge $10 a drink?  The food does not taste like any Chang's I've been to-it's close-but again, something is off here."}
{"text":"I normally love this chain restaurant, but this wasn't a good experience.  We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and there were plenty of empty tables.   Our server was very perky and took our drink orders.   

One of the reasons we picked here is because they have a nice gluten free menu.  We ordered appetizers, soup and entrees.  Our soup arrived first which just irks me.   Appetizers first please!!!!!!     The wonton soup was good, a bit different than most since it contained several shrimp and water chestnuts. We then waited a long time for our dumplings.  They were presented by a kitchen staff and looked beautiful but they didn't bring plates and he dashed away before we could stop him.  Although our server had stopped by too many times before this, she was now nowhere in sight.  We just ate them off the serving plate. Good, not great.  Not really hot, especially after waiting all that time.  The server did come by at some point to apologize for the delay and explained that's why she brought soup first.

The manager and the server continued to keep dropping by to the point of annoyance.   We waited forever for our food which was crazy since there were few patrons.  

Our entrees came, again with no plates. We caught him this time and he slowly brought back 3 plates.   The bottom one was dirty and nobody in sight again. I got up and went to a serving station where a different server was standing and asked for a clean plate. He reached under the counter, pulled out a plate and then picked a white cloth up off the counter, wiped the plate and gave it to me.  I stated I didn't want a plate he had just wiped with a cloth laying on the counter and he stated it was how they cleaned their plates.   WHAT????????

I went back to the table and used a small bread plate for my meal.  I was truly disgusted.  The server stopped by and my husband started to tell her our situation but I stopped him since we had spent soooooooo much time talking with this server that I didn't want to prolong this anymore.  

As far as food goes, the gluten free Mongolian beef was good.  The lemon chicken was tough and too thick.  The fried rice had no eggs and wasn't hot.  Overall, not a great experience."}
{"text":"Meh, would be a good way to describe the food. Came in late on a Saturday, sat at the bar, and had a wonderful bartender. 

I just feel like the food was ok. I mean I didn't taste anything that would grant the prices being higher than any other Chinese restaurant. I would say basic chain Chinese food. Good, but nothing I would go back for. 

We the spicy tuna roll, which basically was a ton of rice and a little tuna, but tasted good. And for entrees we had the new street noodle and the honey chicken. The street noodle has good flavor but the tomato threw me off. And I don't think the noodle was quite a rice noodle. Tasted more like angel hair pasta to me.

I probably would only go back if i just happened to end up here with others, not by choice."}
{"text":"If this is the one in the Planet Hollywood I really loved this - they have a gluten free menu that rocks and people that really treat you right.  Yea, it's a chain but the food is consistently good here and for those who don't want a lot of crap in their food, it's nice the PFCs actually thought through a gluten free menu option. Kudos PFCs.

Try the lemon infused brussel sprouts and the pea pods sautee'd in garlic (not sauce).

3 stars because it's a chain..."}
{"text":"Lettuce wraps and spicy orange chicken my fav the atmosphere loud food great tasting service nice mainly for a group though for romance there are other places but very clean drinks are reasonable"}
{"text":"Okay last November me and my friends were in Vegas and we stayed at Imperial. We haven't been down the strip much yet so we decided to walk and tour the scrip and ended at PH. I really like PH and see a lot of younger crowds than other places. But anyways we were getting hungry so we though since we're here we can get PF Chang. So we went to PF Chang and had to wait about an hour before we got a table. The place is pretty nice with it's design and look very modern. There's an upstairs but I don't know if you're able to eat up there? Looks nice though.

Okay so we got a table and we decided to start off with Dumpling since the Dumpling I had at another PF Chang was really good. Also we ordered Hot & Sour soup. The dumpling turn out to be average and the soup tasted like...nothing. After we finish with that, I was hoping the food would be better because we're hungry. We ordered Pepper Steak, and Chicken with black bean sauce. Okay so the food came out, we were hungry and began to eat. Then, we all looked at each other like wtf? The Pepper Steak has no flavor at all, and the only flavor was the taste those small black pepper that's you're chewing on. The chicken was bad, but it's not as close as the Pepper Steak. Chicken doesn't have much flavor at all but at least it's more edible.

 I can't believe they're in business, I swear this is the worst Chinese Food I'd ever ate. I've ate at PF Chang a few times before and it was decent so they either need a new chef or something because all of the food suck. You ever get that feeling after eating like not being satisfied and wondering if you even ate at all? That's how I felt leaving there like damn, I'm not satisfied and I'm not full. I would give it 2 stars because the place look nice and server was decent but the food is that bad I'm sorry."}
{"text":"After a long weekend we sat down for lunch on a Monday. Our waiter was spot on, and had a great personality. He was attentive enough, without hovering. The Mai Tai we had with our lunch was great... a tad on the strong side for lunch, but would rather have it a tad strong vs. weak. We ordered off of the gluten free section of the menu. I was surprised at the variety on the gluten free section of the menu. The food was very good. In fact we ate a bit more of the noodle dish than we needed to. They definitely don't skip on portion. We ate maybe half of the food and our waiter boxed everything up in front of us. The prices were actually much lower than I had expected. I would most definitely, and probably will, eat here again next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Early Lunch while running around the Surprise/Goodyear area.  Our party of 5 ordered from all over the menu including some appetizers.  The BBQ Ribs were fantastic, would be worth a trip just for that, everyones main dish was very good as well.  Great food, excellent staff, an all around great experience.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Decent location and the food was good but not great. Definately better than fast food like Panda Express, but quality was lacking. Price was ok for what you get.
Our service was excellent!! That is was took it from 3 to 4 stars for us."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try P.F. Chang's for a while. A soon to be expiring gift certificate finally brought me in. We arrived around 8pm with no reservations and to my surprise, the place was still packed. I guess even the downtrodden economy isn't enough to stop the people of Beachwood from consuming mass quantities of Chain Restaurant food.

Anyways, we were told it would be a 45 minute wait, but a high-top at the bar was available. We decided the high-top would be perfectly fine for us.

To start, I decided on one of PF's signature drinks, the Orange Peel Manhattan. It was later revealed that the drink wouldn't be possible to make since the bar ran out of orange bitters. I settled for the \"regular\" Manhattan. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the Lettuce Wraps as recommended by the previous reviewer, Amy T. The wraps definitely stole the show. By far, my favorite dish of the night. 

For an entrée and after much debate in reviewing the elaborate menu, I almost went with the Prawns. Instead, I decided to play it safe and settled on the Hunan Pork. It was basically hunks of pork, peppers and onions slathered in a sodium packed sauce. Nothing about this dish stood out to me. It was just, ok. My date ordered the Ginger Steamed Salmon at a medium-rare temperature. The salmon wasn't cooked properly and was served much more on the rare side. Let's hope for her health that P.F. Chang's uses decent quality, sushi-grade salmon. She was a trooper though and instead of complaining, proceeded to finish the undercooked fish.

After dinner, I switched up drinks and decided to go with The Dude's drink of choice from The Big Lebowski; the White Russian. Once the waiter put in my drink order I saw the bartender make it and put it on the bar, awaiting my waiter to bring it to my table. I gave the waiter the benefit of the doubt as he was obviously swamped. A few more minutes passed and the waiter passed my drink a few more times and I just went to the bar myself and snagged my White Russian. I don't think the waiter ever realized, but the bartender did apologize. Oh well, no biggie. As I told him, I was just thirsty. Then, after all of that, the drink didn't turn out to be all that good either. A White Russian isn't that hard to make, but I found this drink rather disappointing. A standard WR is 2 parts vodka, 1 part Kahlúa with a splash of cream. This drink tasted of way too much cream, little to no coffee liqueur and not enough vodka. Oh well. 

I decided to give the Chang another shot at redeeming itself after a fairly disappointing evening of dining. For dessert, we ordered the Banana Spring Rolls, which were six warm crispy bites with coconut-pineapple ice cream, drizzled with caramel and vanilla sauces. The dessert was plenty satisfying. No complaints there.  

Overall, there were just too many flaws in the evening to award P.F. Chang's an even mediocre rating. Menu items lacking, undercooked food, forgettable food & drinks, scatterbrained service, etc. I would've expected more from a somewhat established chain. Especially one that seems to be a popular destination among the nearby restaurants along Chagrin Blvd. Oh well, live and learn. Next time, I'll save a few bucks and just hit up the local China Express."}
{"text":"Went to p.f. changs to celebrate a birthday and we were greeted by a extremely friendly and attentive gentleman named. Marcus. its a pleasure to dine places where the employees actually listen and acknowledge customers when they greet someone.  When leaving he asked how everything was and were we given birthday dessert.  We said no but its ok and joked saying can I get that to go?
He said of course it should have been offered anyways.  And he promptly placed the order to go.  I expect good service from our server, which quite honestly was subpar, considering we had two wait staff switching off at our table, Michelle and Vicky but i am writing this review for Marcus and his professionalism he showed making our celebration one to remember. By the way ordered the kung pao jimica tacos and they were delicious. I highly recommend trying them.but hope for better service next time."}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent. They somewhat messed up my order and this also created a bit of an issue when I went to pick it up due to it not being in the system as it should have due to them having to redo the order. 

However the manager was attentive and pretty good at handling the questions I had about their gluten free items etc. He actually had called me back to follow up on what I was trying to figure out. So I give him props for that and making sure they fixed the order. 

The bar server / (to go order specialist) was trying to close out and what not and I was in a bit of a hurry to get in and out. She was pretty decent as well considering the mild frustrations I was probably displaying."}
{"text":"Great experience in previous visit in Orlando so tried this one in Charlotte. Apps were cold.  Waiter was loud and too casual.  Cream curdled in coffee.  Sea bass was steamed spinach coated in soy sauce.  After I have been to all other Charlotte restaurants, we may try it again."}
{"text":"I at least expected the food to be hot.  I'm mean, everything we got was cooked in a fiery wok, right?  Seasame chicken and orange peel beef were both room temp and the orange peel beef didn't have an orange taste.  It was very salty and dry. Won't return.  At least to this location.  Our server was at the table to check on things several times while we ate bit when it was time for the check he was back and forth to the kitchen coming out with nothing and couldn't get his attention.  Asked for the check and boxes and he went to print the ticket, then back to the kitchen to get the leather book to put it in yet forgot to come back with the boxes."}
{"text":"Again, not crazy over chain restaurants - I mean, you REALLY have to have some major wow-factor for me to frequent your chain.

But, PF's is so boss. Really.

I have never had a bad meal here - ever. 

Of course, their Lettuce Wraps are spectacular along w/their soups (Egg Drop or the Hot/Sour). Just tried their Pepper Steak last night - it won me over big time.

Their service is always top-ot-fhe-line as well.

Have a special event/celebration? Make sure you let the host/hostess know and they put a secret red paper in w/the servers notes so that your surprise dessert is kept on the down-low. Genius!"}
{"text":"We are long time PF Chang fans. But tonight was a complete let down with everything except our server and hostess. 

We had to send four utensils-plates back to the kitchen for being dirty and old food stuck on them. 

The chicken lettuce wraps and handmade dumplings were very good. The white rice was old and dry, 
Unfortunately the garlic noodles had more cucumber then anything else, they completely smothered the garlic noodles. Again the only saving grace was the server who offered to take it back and have it remade without the cucumbers. 

We wanted to try something new and ordered sesame chicken, that tasted like it came out of a frozen bag. The chicken was dry and spongy. 


Overall very disappointed with the food tonight."}
{"text":"My first trip to PF Changs was a good one. I was seated fast and greeted with the professional courtesy that most customers deserve and expect from a casual dining experience. The food I ordered was equally as pleasing.  I went for lunch and ordered Ginger Chicken with Brocolli and brown rice in the lunch sized portion. I was worried the lunch portion would be too small but it turned out to be just right.  My meal came out fast, hot and fresh. The chicken was tender and the brocolli still slightly crisp. Mixing the sauce and the brown rice was a good way to go. The egg flower soup at the beginning of the meal was good in its own right but had a flavor I am not used to.  I ordered hot green tea. They were out of the regular organic and so they brought me tropical green tea instead. It was a little sweeter and fruitier than the tea I really wanted but it was still good. I had that pot empty by the end of my meal. To finish off my meal I ordered tiramisu for dessert. This was the only disappointing part of the meal. The taste was good but it was frozen. I've never had frozen tiramisu before. Perhaps I was just there too early and it had not defrosted yet. Whatever the case my overall experience was favorable. I got a good meal, hot tea and dessert for $17.51. Not bad. And I had a $25 gift card that now has $7.49 remaining. Maybe I'll go back and get a dessert trio."}
{"text":"Go to their happy hour!!!  3-6 daily!  Everything on the menu is tasty.  The drink specials are really good too.  We've gone to the Planet Hollywood and the Flamingo/Paradise location for the happy hour.  Love it both times!  

If you like spicy...you have to try the Red Dragon Dumplings.  And lettuce chicken wraps are always a must!

Without a doubt, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had a large group and were celebrating the day after our friend's wedding.  We were fortunate to get one of the private rooms on the back so we could enjoy catching up without the noise of the other diners.

Our waitress right off the bat acknowledged us and welcomed us but she definitely seemed annoyed.  We aren't a rowdy group so every time our server, Tiffany, left we were like, \"Did we say something?\"  She came off as very passive aggressive and when we would ask for extras or request water she wouldn't acknowledge that she heard us so we would repeat and she would say, \"In a minute please\" with a forced smile.  

At the end of the meal she didn't bring us fortune cookies even though there was a child in our group that mentioned how much she loved the fortune cookies while Tiffany was in the room.  As we were all leaving the restaurant we all grabbed a cookie from the front desk where Tiffany was standing.  She replied, \"Oh, I forgot to bring you cookies.  Sorry\"  with the same forced smile.

Her off-putting demeanor really put a damper on our dining experience.  Although she didn't do anything way out of line, she didn't do anything to go above and beyond and made us feel like we were making her life difficult.

PF Chang's is always good but there are so many places in Las Vegas that provide better service it may be worth it to skip this place and try something new."}
{"text":"There are so many favorite dishes in here. Chicken lettuce wraps would be our favorite appetizer.  The sea bass, Mongolian beef, beef a la Sichuan, Kung pao shrimp, and finally salt and pepper prawn. This is one of our usual place for dinner.   They used to have the PF Chang for two for $39.99 was a great deal wish they would have it gain with same old menu."}
{"text":"OK, PF Chang's is nothing spectacular but what made this visit better than usual is going with a large group.  Finally I got to try more than the lemon pepper shrimp that my Mom always orders.   Honestly, I haven't looked at a menu in a long time (I only go when Mom is in town and I just choose the wine) and I didn't tonight but my boss ordered a variety of dishes without over ordering for the group.   One major plus over LA locations, there was no wait for a group of 9 at 7PM --- a major plus!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight with some other ladies. Very disappointed. I ordered the one thing on the menu that has curry in it because I like curry. Guess what? No curry in it at all. None. Zilch. Nada. The dish was the Hokkien Street Noodles described as thin rice noodles, light curry sauce, chicken, shrimp, egg, onion, julienned vegetables. The only vegetables I saw besides the onion were a few celery pieces. And no I didn't complain because the ladies I was with were new friends and I just didn't feel comfortable saying anything. I would have felt embarrassed so I just ate about half of the dish, enough to stave off my hunger but not a morsel more. And it was too noisy to hear everything the one lady sitting next to me was saying. Oh well, never again."}
{"text":"Short and Sweet....

Food - Mediocre at best

Service - Poor

I just don't get the popularity of PF Changs. Whenever I buy lunch for my office and warehouse they choose Changs. I always try a different dish and am never satisfied. How much gourmet-tized Panda express items can be had at this joint? I keep trying to find an item I could put in the memory bank for the innevitable future order for the workers. So far I have not found that dish.
 This is by far and wide Americanized, Sticky, Salty and Sweet Chinese food with a limited vegetable offering.  I have had the Sea Bass which was dry and refused to flake. I have had the Mushu Pork and this dish was out of the many, the better of the rest. The Duck was dry and the skin lacked that aromatic licorice roasted skin flavor. Then there is the Panda Express Staples. Orange chicken, Lemon Chicken, Sweet and Sour, Beef Mongolllian, Beef With Brocoli, Low Mein, Kung Pao etc. 
 It may be for you if you like that kind of food. I find it to be very overpriced for mediocre food. If it was fantastic you could not put a price on this that I would not pay. I will say, I went to the restaurant and ordered Ma Pao Tofu and it was at least better than expected.
 If you like more \"City\" style chinese food I do suggest Nee House although their  service sucks, Prime on Camelback, Jade Palace is pretty good, Hong Kong House on Mcdowell and for a nostalgic kick in the ass with relatively good ChinaTown dishes try Dragon Palace. These places are less expensive and taste much better than Changs. Heres a pointer too, if chinese chefs are cooking your food....well, who better?"}
{"text":"I came to las Vegas for a yearly convention and during that time I was invited to have dinner with friends and they brought me to Las Vegas.

for starters the first impression of Las Vegas was intense when I came for the first time then my friends  showed me the great side of it.... the suburvia side.

We walked in and we immediately were greeted...I love that sometime some places they just ignore you until they want to say hi!

We were told that the wait time was a few minutes so we hit the bar.. we requested afew drink and they were pretty loaded... as per  every drink you have in vegas is heavy loaded....

in not time were were having lunch the food and service was really good...I know that this is another chain but I would totally recommend this place, in any citie I'm in I would look for one if I feel the desire for a chinese Bistro."}
{"text":"This place was an ok place.  I was not amuzed with the slow service.  There were 6 people working the front desk.... (you dont need that many people) We gave our names atleast 3 times to 3 different people who skipped over us and sat other parties that came in after us.  Ended up waiting for about 45 mins with a 10 min quoted time.  Our server was very good, but I noticed the people around us who had different servers ordered before us and got our food after us.

Their mai tai's sucked.  Drinks were not strong, or atleast descent for restaurant quality.  Food was ok.  Portions are a lot smaller then the other PF Changs.  One thing I did like about this restaurant is that they are not over priced for being on the strip, its the same pricing as other PF Changs."}
{"text":"Not too good.  Very sweet and the price is very outrageous.   Pf hangs because it left me hanging.  Waitress was awesome though. Steph...."}
{"text":"This place isnt bad. The food is too sweet and strangely tastes exactly like the p.f. changs from the frozen food aisle. I'm just not a fan of the taste. The inside is gorgeous and the waiter was a little too talkative, but very nice. I think this place is worth checking out once."}
{"text":"I hope you like salt and have never had Asian food before beyond Panda Express or Kyoto bowl.

The fact that PF Chang's is allowed to exist by China (to whom the US owes its existence). Here's a tip for Asian cuisine: are there Asian's there? If the answer is no...

I have never had more consistently bad service and tasting food. I cannot requisite ever going there again. I recommend yo skip it. If you are looking for Chinese food in the valley give this a wide berth.

BTW Pei Wei is also PF Changs. I would review them separately but cannot get up the ambition to discuss bad memories any more..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day...as we sat down to view the menu, a ant was on my menu...killed it and didn't think much of it...as I was talking to my friend I see a ant crawling across his chest..then we started to look around and found another one in the booth so we immediately told staff and moved to another booth...the manager looked around the booth and thought it was \"weird\" he didn't see anything...after we moved to the other booth our waitress set plates in front of us and my plate had a dead fruit fly on it and I immediately called it out and showed the manager as well...no one had any comments...and to top it off I ordered a Mai tai and it was served with a dead fruit fly as well...we didn't eat our food that was served or I didn't drink my drink..payed for the bill and took off. Nothing was comped."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be. Customer service pretty bad. Sorry to bother you while you are hustling through your sidework, bartenders. Food is ok, pretty reliable but some of it tastes processed. Not going back. Thai Basil right down the street has excellent friendly service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Went out with a friend on Saturday.  The salmon was delicious.  The staff was very pleasant.  I don't know why I haven't gone there before.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Always delicious and servers have been great.  Love the surf & turf and you can never go wrong with the Mongolian beef and lettuce wraps. And their banana spring rolls are to die for. They actually have really tasty sushi too."}
{"text":"First time ever at P.F Chang's, my ate here as we had a show at Planet Hollywood to see, we ordered Shrimp Dumplings, Dan Dan Noodles & Shakin Beef, it was so delicious!! One of the best chain restaurants I've been to! Great price, we got to sit on the patio looking onto the strip at night, it was great!"}
{"text":"Always great at Pf changs. Been coming here for many years. First time at pf changs was back in 1998. So this is for sure an old school eatery. Its always great prices...yummy food and casual atmosphere. Not a fan of the paradise location due to it being so ghetto in that area but hey it could be worse. Its usually hit and miss when it comes to servers. I almost gave 4 stars for that fact but because I love their food and atmosphere so much I just couldnt give 4 stars. But they definitely need to keep an eye on their servers they lack in customer service skills and not very intuitive. You get such big portions here for such an awesome price. For all that you order you would think it would be more but the bill always comes back to be so low even after ordering apps, entrees and dessert. Yum to pf changs...i always highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have never been a big fan of this restaurant but my friend was very hungry the day we went. So I caved in. We had a very helpful and attentive waiter at this particular PFE Chang's. I think his name was Vincent. I have a shellfish allergy. Turns out oyster sauce is in a whole lot of the dishes in the various sauces. He quickly printed out the shellfish-free menu for me. I had the honey chicken with brown rice. It was quite tasty. He checked in with us quite regularly. I would consider another stop at a PG Chang's in the future."}
{"text":"Holy slow as hell! 

My mother in law and I had tickets to go see Wicked this past Sunday. We parked and then walked down to PF Changs, we got there at about 445. They were already slam packed. We were quoted a 30 minute wait time but I think we only waited 15 minutes, score! 

Once we go to the table, we waited and waited to be acknowledged. Once we were we waited again for another 10 minutes just for our drinks. We ordered an app and it came out fairly quick. However after they cleared the app plate away we waited at least another 20 minutes for our food. As we were getting our food people were quickly clearing out to go to gammage. We had to eat pretty fast. We got to gammage just as they were making the announcement to be seated. 

Moral of the story, we got to Changs an hour and 45 minutes before the show started, so if you plan to go here before hand, maybe get there 2.5 hours before hand as the service is sloooooow. 

Food was great!"}
{"text":"Pf Changs and I have a love hate relationship. I love the favors , the environment, the meatless options, the happy hour , the friendly staff, and many more. I only go during happy hours because the prices jumped which doesn't make it a  decent priced meal anymore...especially for tofu. I go during happy hour and love the crowed, it is not loud, and they have a great deal on many meals. Once my gift card is up I will probably not eat at PF Changs anymore."}
{"text":"My daughter and son and I came here for dinner.... Orange peel chicken, lo mein , and sushi!! Valerie was our server and she was amazing..... She also looks like the chick from the sitcom King of Queens!!! This place is amazing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was typical of any other PF Changs I've been too.  Prices were the same as any other location too, I was expecting them to be about double as are most other places in Vegas.  The service here wasn't very good.  We had to wait about 30 minutes for our lettuce wraps, which seemed a little ridiculous.  Our dinners took another 20 minutes.  The food was good and hot when it finally arrived.  The layout of the restaurant wasn't so great and servers had to constantly push through crowds of customers since the kitchen was on the other side of the waiting area."}
{"text":"This is a good place but there is always a wait time of up to 30 to 45min. We have come early and later and its always the same. It took over an hr to be seated. I think they forgot about us. After finally getting a table r server was perfect. Now not only did we get r table late BC they forgot about us now r main course is running behind. The manager was just at r table telling us the kitchen was behind and did not even offer free drinks or anything, any other place would have offered something. Well is total BS we sat here watching several other people get their meals and desserts and we still have not gotten r food yet. This is such BS we r not coming back here. We asked them to box r food up at this point. None of this should reflect the waiter. The manger is a BIG ASSHOLE here. He should be fired. They should have given r whole meal free after everything we went thru. People that had sate down after we had were leaving and we had not even gotten r dinner yet. I will not come back to this place. Happy mother's day to me. The two go dessert was a joke."}
{"text":"Bruce r waiter/server was the best. This place is amazing two story PF Chang's great place everyone was amazing. We had a reservation for 4:30pm and got in at 4:05pm And this place is busy. Dinner was good and I cannot wait till desert yummy chocolate cake. Great place coming back and asking to site upstairs next time or even outside. Remember ask for Bruce u will get the best service."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this location often and have always loved it! We planned to
Go tonight for Mother's Day but had to order take out instead. Our order was incomplete and the portions were much smaller than what we expected. I called and talked to
Patrick (one of the managers) and he was AMAZING! He was very sympathetic and went WAY above and beyond to make it right. I can't thank him enough for his generosity and consideration! A positive YELP review just doesn't seem like enough express my gratitude and appreciation. Thank you so much Patrick! You're a rock star!"}
{"text":"Food is very similar to Pei Wei, just double the price and a more upscale environment."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times (like, A LOT) and I have never been dissapointed. Not sure why this place has so many poor reviews!? Last night we had reservations for a certain time and being that it was a typical busy Friday night we had to wait about 10 minutes (which was really no big deal for us). The manager, Jewls, personally came over to get our drink order started. Our server, Alex, was a sweetheart; very friendly and nice. Totally on top of the refills! Despite having a party of over 40 people seated next to us, our food order was not delayed at all. After we ate the manager came by again to let us know she comped our appetizers since we had to wait to be seated! What a nice surprise and excellent customer service. The only negative (which has nothing to do with the restaurant) is that you have to pay for downtown parking and it's at a premium on the busy weekend evening. You may have to walk a block or two. Cheers!!!

UPDATE: We were here this weekend and Alex was our server again. He was just as sweet and charming. My mom accidentally left her CC on the table and realized it the next day. Alex made sure it got to the manager and put in the safe. Thanks Alex!!"}
{"text":"Waited long time to be seated and they put us in the worst possible both just because we came with our 4 kids...it took the food hours to be served and there. We had the soup and after two bites i found a hair in mine...we told them to take it and they didn't even took it off the check at the end. The food consistency was poor - we ordered the same dish twice and one was really good while the other wasn't 

In short - expected more and was very disappointed"}
{"text":"You have to love the Changs. I got some wonton soup with all of its wonderful floaty goodness like obviously the wonton some shrimp a few mushrooms and green stuff yum. 

Also the dry rub ribs with a little container of Asian magic dust. Love that stuff. 

I also had the jicama spring rolls but they do not travel well when you cut them and do 50 on the way home. They get a little unrolled if you will. 

Friendly bartender at this location."}
{"text":"I'm soooo glad to hear other people are surprised by the rave. PF Changs is AWFUL. Over-priced and truly disgusting. I have had one horrible experience after another. I will never return. So many other options that are less expensive and more appetizing."}
{"text":"Customer service was great. Food was awesome, just don't order sangria."}
{"text":"Well, visiting from the hollars of WNC, it was time to visit another place I liked, but just didn't have a good time when I did it with the basket dropper.....the farther down the line the better things get..........

I still find the bar the best area to eat in this place.  Bar staff on top notch and helpful with selection and service.

Happy hours still are the best value."}
{"text":"Chang, Changs getting Changs over here. This is the song that comes to mind when I think of PF Changs. I know this is a chain restaurant but it's DAMN good every time I go. Usually I just get a few appetizers. If you are looking for authentic Chinese cuisine then you are at the wrong place. As a matter of fact authentic Chinese food is really not all it's cracked up to be. this is a great place to go with friends or right before the move. I love the steamed pork dumplings with lettuce wraps and c'mon now the Mongolian been is the ish! If people give this place a bad review because it's a chain then that's just silly. Everyone already knows it's a chain and frankly Changs must be doing something right to be as big as they are.  There are time s I get \"Chang-ed out\" but I will always end up back there for some yummy spring rolls!  I did choose to review this spot because it is my favorite I love the atmosphere in here and because it's in Tempe it's a younger crowd and laid back so I do prefer this location to others I have been to in my short time in AZ."}
{"text":"P.F. Stands for Paul Fleming - as in the steak house. Just understand it's a corporate venue. I've been to several P.F. Chang's including the one in Middleton. It's Fast Food - Sit Down Style.  My experience has been that the food is over salted and  it is the definition of Asian Food for Americans... for frightened Americans who what to eat Chinese cuisine without eating Chinese or Asian cuisine.  

People who follow my reviews know I prefer local joints - locally owned and sourced... P.F. Chang's isn't my sort of place.  But if you are looking for the quintessential American style Chinese fusion chain... this is it - have at it."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to dine out. We ordered a few of our usual appetizers: both chicken and vegetarian lettuce wraps, fried green beans, and dynamite shrimp. All good, but pretty salty. My entree was the crispy honey shrimp, and though it tasted good, it was served with the crunchy rice noodles and green onions. I would've liked vegetables on it. Dessert was okay, it's nice to share. I guess my tastes have changed because I used to love their food but now I find it all right. Attentive service and nice atmosphere though."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good! Love the shrimp dumplings and the Kung Pao Chicken. The wonton soup is pretty killer too and so are the lettuce wraps. Love the deep friend bananas for dessert with that coconut ice cream. Delish!"}
{"text":"Great location, great service and great food!  Happy hour is a must if you are like looking for a good deal in a great meal and beverage.  I wish they had a few more GF options fir Happy Hour. Parking is free in the garage attached to the building."}
{"text":"Always clean and the service has been good every visit, the food is hit or miss as the steamed dumplings come out dry and crispy. The edamame is good but the spicy tuna roll was not sushi style fresh fish, it was more like spicy cat food."}
{"text":"The kung pao shrimp and fried bananna desert is delish!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and had the egg rolls, crab wontons, chicken lettuce wraps, and wok fired filet mignon with brown rice.  

The food was okay, but my filet mignon was overcooked and quite dry.  I was having visions of nice, juicy steak in my mind when I had ordered it, but I suppose this place isn't a fancy steakhouse, so I shouldn't have expected too much.  But I had hoped the meat would have been a bit more tender instead of tough little bits.  Oh well.  

Ambiance was nice though.  A beautifully decorated restaurant with excellent staff.  Too bad the food is only so-so."}
{"text":"Wow great service by this very attentive server named Mike Snyder use to be a surfer in California.  Me and my husband were there and he was just so nice.  We are on a crazy diet and had a zillion questions on what each menu items had what ingredients and he was just so patient it was really nice.  We didn't fell rushed and even though we only ordered water due to our diet he didn't roll his eyes like many places we do eat at.  It was a great afternoon and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"I had a date with my girl and we loved it , our server was Jennifer she recommended few dishes and we were not disappointed.  Usually I am not a Chinese food lover but this place makes me go back again . There ambience is amazing . Enjoyed every bit of it and the Manger even stopped and asked if evrrything was good or not which was very nice of him ."}
{"text":"Great service. They sat us down right away with a nice view of the city. Our waiter Blake was fantastic and friendly. The food was out of this world, as usual. I would recommend this place, for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. 
picked up a to-go order for my husbands birthday; What a disappointment. My husband was spitting out pieces of chicken that were rubbery and I could only eat part of mine due to the frost bite on my chicken. 
Pei Wei is Better and half the price."}
{"text":"Food was good as usual. The waiter charged us the wrong amount when he brought out my receipt after swiping my card. He said it didn't go through but when I looked at my bank account it showed me the amount he said he didn't charge. That was an inconvenience. I didn't get charged that in the end but waiting three days for that to clear was annoying."}
{"text":"I took two of my work colleagues to PF Changs for lunch Wednesday December 18th.  The quality of the food was on par with what I experience at past visits but the service was very rushed even though the restaurant was less than half full. Appetizers and main courses were served without adequate time to finish the appetizers prior to the main course arriving at the table.  As we were about half way finished eating our main coursed the server asked if what we wanted for desert. We advised her we were still eating our lunches and were not ready to consider deserts.  About 3 minutes later we were presented with our check.  We were in rushed in and out in about 20 minutes for no reason.  I think a little more staff training would help both the customers and the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to Chang's coast to coast, about 35 locations actually, and was disappointed a week ago in Las Vegas (the one off the strip) so I told my server Troy to ask the cook to knock it out of the park (Sesame Chicken).  WOW!!!  Crispy edges and the sauce nice and thick the way it SHOULD be!!!   I always tell people if you ever have Chang's the way it's SUPPOSED t be done it will knock your socks off!!   Unfortunately their QC has gone south long ago and they need to get their shit together big time because this wonderful preparation is actually now the exception to the rule.  Nonetheless this was perfect albeit because it was off peak and I made the request but I'm not local so I don't know how this location usually does.  My server Troy was also great to interact with.  I laid down the law as being real laid back right from the start and he did a great job and went along with everything like a real pro.  Corporate take notice of this picture and PLEASE get your Quality Control in order so this is what people get nationwide when they go to Changs!!!!"}
{"text":"Chang's around corporate always seem to have good preparation unlike many around the country who suffer from QC issues.  Was delighted at the new bibimbap menu item one of the best meals I've ever had.  Great service and great prep."}
{"text":"What a great place. Great food( especially for us gluten free people), great atmosphere and great service. Every time I come in I get seated , greeted and served quickly. I love their gluten-free menu. The chicken lettuce wraps and the fried rice, Delicious! They also have great herbal tea. We've been lucky enough to be served by Chris ( who is fabulous and always remembers us) and Brenden who was oh so kind to us. I would suggest asking for either of these guys. Nice place to go on a date, hangout with friends or spend time with family. Love this place."}
{"text":"Great date night place!  We, fortunately, made reservations (highly recommended) as there is a wait on a Monday night.  We were seated promptly and the manager was very attentive in the interim between the seating and our server.   We partook in a predinner cocktail and it was oh so fantastic!!  This is a great place to come if you have someone who doesn't eat  a lot of meat as they have vegan and vegetarian friendly dishes that are Great!"}
{"text":"Oh yea I'm a fan for sho!! So, my better and half and I frequent this place quite a bit!  It's awesome!  Make a reservation, they're always busy!  So for a surprise bday party, they were incredibly accommodating for the 12 people that I had invited and even allowed for me to bring an ice cream cake and borrow their ice box for it!  The waitress was a rock star by far this passed time.  She got every ones order correctly entered and the kitchen rocked it out!  I recommend the curry veggies!  Yum!!!  
As far as the bday!  Oh yea, he was surprised and the cake was Epic World of Warcraft..with people coming from around the restaurant to check it out once the kitchen prepped it..  I hear I got some bonus points for this one :)"}
{"text":"It is a \"big chain\" kind of place, but still I love the variety and quality of food. Fresh, quality ingredients esp the veggies. And service is good too. It is good for groups: corporate lunches, family dinners etc.
Only issue is that it is in the Tempe downtown area and has parking problems because of it. You have to park in the nearby garage, but you can get your ticket validated at the restaurant: so FREE parking. There are other parking spaces nearby: street metered, ASU visitor etc, but they are not validated and NOT FREE."}
{"text":"Basically, this is Chinese food for the non-adventurous. Very familiar flavors without the \"what the hell am I eating\" component that you get with most authentic Chinese places. You're going to get very safe food that caters to the cautious eater.

Service was good. I got my refills as well as menu recommendations for my first time visit.

Environment is also very welcoming for groups, keeping it trendy, somewhat upscale, with a mix of casual.


As for the food...
-Tofu lettuce wraps: Decent. Sauce was overpowering enough that I could barely even taste anything else.
-Crispy Honey Chicken: This dish reminded me of something I could get at Panda Express.. with 25% more meat.
-Sweet & Sour Chicken: Also another dish that tasted like food court food, but double the price.
-Mandarin Chicken: A sort of chicken stir fry. Nothing impressive about this basic dish.

Maybe for happy hour dim sum, this place would be an okay stop after a day of work. For dinner, it was a huge disappointment. You're pretty much paying for the atmosphere, not the food. I would probably come back if I were invited, just because it's a nice place to kick back and relax with friends. I definitely wouldn't go back on my own will though."}
{"text":"Can't believe I came all the way to Vegas to go to a PF Chang's but honestly, this one was good. A little more expensive than normal, but a group of us went for a super late dinner on a weeknight and the waitress was really cool and friendly and super accommodating. Wish I remembered her name...

Anyway, the usual staples are good here: beef with broccoli, spicy green beans, sesame chicken, etc."}
{"text":"I've been to many a PF Chang's but this is the first as a vegetarian. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. This was my first night in Vegas, with my mother, and we decided last minute to go to PF Chang's. 

My mother ordered a salad with salmon, which she loved. We both nibbled on the Cauliflower Tempura and my Stir-Fry Eggplant and fried rice. Everything was good! We even had enough food to take home."}
{"text":"I have been here a plethora of times. Guests always want to eat here. Must be the HUGE doors out front. Or the carved horses other places. Its a nice looking place. Food is PF Changs good. If you have never had authentic Chinese, this is probably like discovering nirvana. But its salty, lots of similarity in sauces and drinks, while good, are expensive. I had a gift card, Had to go."}
{"text":"They have gluten free and Vegetarian options, sweet meat!! 
Sean was super nifty, he's a great waiter!  
We'll be back again fo sho!"}
{"text":"We just missed the happy hour that started at 3pm, which is my only regret about eating here. I had the coconut curry with tofu, and man, that was some of the best curry I've had...especially coming from a national chain joint. We had crispy wontons to start off, and I had to stop myself from overindulging in them. The staff was great at getting us everything we needed, and we had the perfect weather to take advantage of their outdoor seating.

Tried to go back for happy hour a couple days later, but it was too packed to move. If you want to hit that, I'd get there right at 3."}
{"text":"Avoid the PF Chang's at Kierland.  Loud, randomly chosen music.  Chicken lettuce wraps - chicken burned, should use newer lettuce.  

Need to pay more attention to food preparation and quality."}
{"text":"They made us wait 5 minutes for a table even though it was half empty. When we were finally seated 5 more minutes went by with even a hello. We left."}
{"text":"Ok, yes everyone knows that this is not authentic Chinese Food- kind of along the same lines as Cheesecake Factory- a known chain restaurant- nicely decorated, with good eats (reliable for lettuce chicken wraps, mongolian beef, and lunch bowls, anyway). The only other exception is that there is a Happy Hour menu everyday. 

We came here to celebrate Christmas Eve dinner with my father-in-law and his wife (my husband's step-mom). We had a reservation for 6 pm- although there were two parties ahead of us. The lobby was packed. We ended up getting a beeper and sitting at the bar- no smirnoff ice, no mango martini- those were my first choices, but I ended up getting a glass of merlot. 

We requested a booth (there was one available BTW) on our reservation but got a table (Richie was the server)- we let him know and the manager was sent right over. She told us that unfortunately they can't hold the booths, and apologized, but as soon as the party (two senior ladies) behind us would leave the booth, we could have that one (we waited a half hour before getting the booth finally but had ordered in the mean time). Mid-appetizer (lettuce chicken wraps- could've used more lettuce leaves- and watch the water dripping off (a warning) & steamed pork dumplings- delicious), the party left- so we moved, and since we used the other server (the booth was his station), we were happy to finally get the booth. Kudos to the two servers (my husband tipped the initial server because he was sacrificing his table) and the manager for getting us the booth. 

We ordered chicken fried rice, chicken in black bean sauce (I didn't get any beans in my portion- maybe dropped to the bottom of the serving plate), mongolian beef, and changs spicy chicken- family style. I wanted a dish with some vegetables but majority rule was against me- but my husband said it was not at all intentional (not counting the rice). I should mention that two small bowls of rice (one white, one brown) were also part of the entrees. The mongolian beef (very tasty), although not as spicy like in traditional chinese cooking (but I added some chili sauce on my plate)- everyone agreed on the beef. I liked the chicken in the black bean sauce better than the other chicken dish though. The portions on the entrees were small. The fried rice was huge in comparison. 

The servers were all very good- taking plates away as soon as he noticed that we were done, and filling up the water glasses. He wrapped up the leftovers, presented us with fortune cookies, and left the check. We didn't want to linger (my father-in-law loves to talk afterward) as the restaurant was very busy. Our reason for coming here was to celebrate with dinner and walk across to the District to walk around (but the stores were all closed except the sports store and the restaurants)."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised it was not a busier time for lunch on a sunday (yesterday). But maybe sunday's chill time, because some people have church, maybe more people go out for breakfast vs. lunch, maybe there are a lot of other dining choices on the area (Summerlin's growing). Well, it was nice, to get seated right away, so no complaints here. (Maybe I'm comparing it to the touristy one on Paradise and Flamingo, which was always jam-packed, in previous visits over the years.) 

We (my husband, our son, me, my Mother-In-Law and her husband) had a bunch of different things, family style. The food: Chang's Lettuce Wraps (a classic PF Chang's favorite; always yummy!), Hokkien Street Noodles- combo (new recipe, curry), Sesame Chicken (broccoli and peppers- crisp), Mongolian Beef (tender flank steak with garlic, green onion; one of their best dishes, not spicy), Chicken Fried Rice (egg, carrots, bean sprouts, green onion; cooked perfectly), and, later, Signature Lo Mein (egg noddle, mushrooms, asian vegetables; excellent taste!). Everything was delicious, except the new recipe Hokkien Street Noodles (thin rice noodles, curry sauce, chicken, shrimp, egg, onion, julienned vegetables)---this was terrible. So we sent it back. I am not a fan of curry unless it is Thai curry. I don't even like the smell of the other curry, either. Sorry, just being honest.   

The menu is pretty varied, not just Chinese, but explore flavors of Asia; there is something for everyone- Chinese (dim sum), Vietnamese (lava cake), Japanese (sushi). The following menu types are: street fare, dim sum, salads, sushi, market sides, soups, main entrees: chicken, beef, seafood, vegetarian, noodles & rice. There are also gluten-free selections, kids menu (desserts too), beverage, & daily squeeze, and desserts. Weekday Lunch pairings (just to name a few, ahi poke bowl, chang's lettuce wraps, with soup, salad, or spring rolls; $10.95- $12.50) and wok classics (sesame chicken, miso glazed salmon, beef with broccoli, just to name a few) are for monday through friday, until 4 pm (pricing ranges from $9.50 to $12.50). Also does takeout, BTW. I got a menu for when we get the hankering. 

The food philosophy is Farm to Wok. The food is cooked fresh (made to order). I also like the fact that all the meat (including seafood) sources are USA-based, as well, as the white rice and brown rice (in light of \"plastic rice\", I'm sure you can appreciate this too).   

The service was excellent, from the hostess (very nice), to our server (she was also patient, when we were all looking at the menu, trying to figure out what we all wanted), to the exit (we were thanked for coming in and received goodbye greetings). Our server was apologetic when we didn't like the Hokkien Street Noodles (all it took was one bite for me to agree that it was not good), and she was very attentive- filling up our waters without us asking and she checked on us several times to see how we were doing. She packed up all the leftovers for us too, complete with a bag.   

The ambiance was very nice. It's elegant. There are a couple statues in the lobby, where there is also seating should there be a wait. Plush booth seating (near the window) and tables/ chairs. Not your typical Asian eatery. I'm not saying that all the restaurants in China Town are dumps, I'm just saying, that this one's slightly elevated than the typical norm. Sometimes, you visit small restaurants, local ones near your home, and sometimes, you also want to enjoy the atmosphere, too. Isn't variety the spice of life?   

Join the club, get points to get started, earn freebies. Just give your server your telephone number. Not sure if there is an expiration date to collecting the points (some clubs have one)."}
{"text":"This trendy restaurant is located in the section known as \"Restaurant Row.\" This was the first location and now there are a handful of these restaurants all over the valley. I've been here many times. Sometimes the execs at my job get me lunch here- I get the Lunch Bowl- Moo Goo Gai Pan (stir fried chicken and vegetables- one of the better- for- you dishes to eat here), with the egg drop soup, and a bowl of rice- for under $10. Note: this is a 2 serving portion- learned this when I was looking at the nutritional information section posted on the website. I tend to read the fine print- I'm just saying.
 
The lettuce wraps are their signature appetizer- excellent! I don't believe that I've ever had a bad meal here ever. I'm curious to try their Happy Hour sometime in the near future. If and when I do, I will post an update. 

This location is very pretty with very nice ambiance. I think that there is also outdoor seating. It used to be so crowded but I think the fact that there are more locations around the city, alleviates that, a bit. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"I've been to another P.F. Chang's location, and was not impressed. But everyone is always raving about this place, so I decided to give it another chance. I checked out the new location at Settler's Ridge on a Saturday afternoon. At 3pm they had a 30-40 minute wait (I told you, people love this place...) but luckily we found a seat in the bar area immediately. 

We ordered from the small selection of lunch bowls, available until 4pm. I got the \"Asian\" grilled salmon bowl, which was around $8 and comes with egg drop or hot and sour soup. I started with egg drop soup, which was pretty good and not all broth. As for the salmon, the portion was small but reasonable for a lunch size. The salmon was cooked very well, but was totally lacking in flavor or seasoning, so I had to douse it in the variety of oils they provide on the table. My mom's sesame chicken bowl was equally uninteresting and just lacking in flavor all around.

I can see how the decor and environment would appeal to most, and I can see how the bland food would appeal to the large number of people who can't handle actual, real live ethnic food. But it's just not for me."}
{"text":"This PF Chang's is located in Summerlin, right across the street from Boca Park. It's in a booshie part of town, so yes, you will get the Bentley's, Mercedes, blah, blah here. 

What I really like is their outside seating area. When it's winter time, they have heaters and clear covers in the patio area so that there's less cold air coming into the seating area. There was a large group of high school kids getting ready for homing coming that sitting across from us, a group of about 20, so if you're the type that likes to dine with a gigantic group, they have the capability to accommodate you, I'm sure they need notice for a group that large though. 

I liked their food, it's basically over priced Chinese food with modernized, Chinese looking decor in the restaurant. Honestly, I'd rather go to some place in China Town. The only reason why we end up going to any PF Chang's is because we have a gift card. But, it does the job. 

The service is great, very attentive... But I expect that, considering the location of this restaurant. :)"}
{"text":"I love this place.... the lettuce wraps, mangolian beef, chicken lomein... It was all tasty.  Plus it was kid friendly for a classier place to eat.  The staff was super nice. I will always come back. :)"}
{"text":"Loved it ! Great food and service . Alex was a fantastic server . Thank you also tonight of the managers for stopping by to check on us . Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I ordered a grilled chicken salad without dressing.  It arrived drenched in dressing.  The nice waitress ordered me a new salad.  It arrived with slimy pieces of lettuce on the top.  I asked for the manager.  She ordered me a third meal (salmon without the salad).  It took so long for the meal to arrive that the manager had to apologize.  This has rarely ever happened to me but when it did the cost of the meal was always on the house.  We weren't even offered dessert.  Much less the offer of a courtesy coffee."}
{"text":"I would only recommend this place if you don't like the taste of authentic Asian food. Everything is pretty standard on the menu, nothing too special about this place. If you want to eat spicy food, make sure to tell your waiter you want it REALLY spicy otherwise they won't add much chili powder"}
{"text":"This place serves it purpose, and I don't know if they are reading customer reviews but we experienced none of the issues noted by the previous yelpers. 

We were asked politely where we would like to sit because it was a weeknight with not many people in house. Everything looked clean, the wait staff was professional and happy, and  even though runners brought us our food, our waiter still paid close attention to our needs.

Our food was fresh and tasty and everything was as ordered. We had enough food, the only thing that kicked it down from 4 stars was the beef to vegetable ratio in one dish was odd seeing that there was about 3 times as much sliced celery compared to spicy beef.  

The desert was on time, and the prices are more for the ambiance than the food. This is like a different cultural version of the cheesecake factory but I feel I get less bite per buck.

Overall, it's a nice place for a romantic date and I would suggest it to friends."}
{"text":"Great service!! Bartender and servers were fast and efficient. Food was good but the service was 5 stars. Sushi was ok."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've dined at PF Changs. Everyone told me before that this is not authentic Chinese food and it's over priced. All the rumors are true. I wouldn't dine here again. Overall the atmosphere was fine and service was friendly. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"All time favorite restaurant. Chicken lettus wrap and dan Dan noddles are my favorite."}
{"text":"How the mighty fall. At least metaphorically. This place used to be THE place for tasty and creative Asian cuisine. We realized just how long it had been since we dined at PF Chang. 
The lettuce wraps were so good that starting your meal with this item was almost mandatory. The lettuce was perfectly carved to make for terrific presentation as well as functional. Now the lettuce leaves are just piled atop of the filling. You practically have to put the extra leaves on the table to scoop filling. Remember that really tasty sauce the server would mix at the table to accommodate your preferred level of spice? No longer. Now just a little cup of bland sauce on the plate. 

We shared the crispy honey chicken, which was still very good. 

The service. The protocol at PFC for table service is the assigned server does everything for that table. No such thing as any available server running food to patrons. We had to ask for plates for the lettuce wraps, water, water refills and if our second round of drinks were ready (they showed up moments before the check). 
Sad really."}
{"text":"Good Food.  Had not gone for a year but I took family and both sets of parents out for dinner.  It was good.  Waiter was helpful and very attentive.  Sea Bass was wonderful.  We will go again."}
{"text":"I have been craving Asian food for quite some time and this definitely hit the spot! On a Sunday evening, it was not packed what so ever. My partner and I, had a very kind waiter. He recommended his favorites, as well as checked on us in a nice timely manner. The food was so great! I am beyond stuffed to where I won't be needing to wake up in the middle of the night to eat my midnight snack. I had a nonalcoholic ginger drink that was delightful & refreshing. Lettuce wraps & well seasoned chicken... I'm all for it!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, however the Brussels sprouts are terrible. Too sour and not pleasing to eat."}
{"text":"I don't usually frequent chains. Food was so salty. At first we ordered the lettuce wraps, way too salty, couldn't eat them. I ordered a spicy dish with tofu and brown rice. Still tasted more salty than spicy to me but was edible. Gave 2 stars because the mojito was delish! The service was average. The décor is nice but way too dark- I like to be able to see the food I'm eating and the person I'm taking to lol."}
{"text":"Food came out late, the vegetarian curry had chicken, never got chilled glasses for the beers, all in all an awful experience. The poor waitress was new and completely buried and not one manager stopped to help her! A manager should lead from the front by helping when employees are struggling! She couldn't even find the guy!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service! Every time I go here, I'm always greeted with a smile as well as awesome service from the servers. They are always patient with me in ordering since, I'm still technically new to pf changs (I'm used to the pf chang frozen meals in grocery store)"}
{"text":"PF Chang's has gone downhill big time, at least at this location. I ordered fried rice and Sichuan beef which both were complete garbage. Maybe it was the chefs fault but regardless never again. I wouldn't even feed this nasty food to my dog. See photos."}
{"text":"The Kierland location is great.  We always come in for happy hour!  Friendly bartender named Alexis that gives great suggestions on the wine pairing for meals."}
{"text":"Food was great but walked outside fretting left overs (1/2 of expensive meal ) turned back in minutes and front receptionist said they threw it away without even checking. Not nice.... Really disappointed  really poor customer service"}
{"text":"They screwed up out take out order, unfortunately was not discovered until after my 15 min drive home. I called to speak with a manger. The lady manager was extremely rude on the phone explaining that PF CHANGS out sources the calls center  that takes the orders, so they have no quality control. She was full of excuses, and not resolutions. Extremely disappointed in the particular restaurant."}
{"text":"this locations takes really good care  of big groups .... food is always consistant at PF Changs but the service here sets them apart of all others"}
{"text":"too much oil, sauce.  not fresh tasting as when they opened.  
the TGIF of chinese food."}
{"text":"I called for takeout ten minutes before closing time and they were still happy to assist. I was greeted right away when I walked in and it was a quick and easy process. The server at the bar was friendly and made my day just a little better. I haven't dined in the restaurant before, but I definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"The only thing I like during my experience at PF Chang's was the egg drop soup. The steamed rice served looked like the cheapest long grain rice you can find in Walmart. Aside from being uncooked it was dry and loose, not the usual sticky Asian rice. Such a shame being an Asian restaurant where rice is the main staple and shouldn't be messed up. I find the rice in any Chinese buffet way much better! And actually it seemed like the food we had at PF Chang's were clones of your neighborhood Chinese buffets. We had Mongolian beef because it seems like they said it's one of the best but what I had was a beef stewed in sweet soy sauce with tons of chives. We also had the Cantonese shrimp which was very bland and didn't taste a thing. I say, it is overrated add to that over priced for such a taste. Thanks for the experience anyway."}
{"text":"After a long day of sight seeing we were famished. Service was good...a few mixups with our dishes but the manager Erica sure made our dining experience much better. Food was pretty good too. The shrimp steamed dumplings were my fave out of everything we tried. The organic agave Margarita was also quite yummy. Thanks Erica for everything :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food...as always! Thanks PF Chang's! Love the Lettuce Wraps and Crab Wontons!"}
{"text":"You're better off eating at the actual restaurant than doing take out. I can't believe there was a sticker from the peppers in my food. Not to forget the food was cold when I got it home. Very disappointed. Train your chef to pull off the sticker .  ALSO there were still seeds from the pepper on the actual pepper and the onions weren't cooked all the way. Appetite completely lost."}
{"text":"Trying to enjoy my food with the smell of marijuana in the air ,thought  it would pass .it did not  people sat on the wall on the strip.By the patio and smoke finally got up and went inside"}
{"text":"I had such high expectation of this visit since my numerous visits to the locations in Minnesota never disappointed. I received a gift card and decided to treat my daughter to dinner. 

When we arrived we were sat in the booth near the host station so we got to listen to their banter and we felt like we were on display as people waiting for their tables have no choice but to stare at you lol 

The menu has all the usual favorites but when the food arrived it was lacking flavor. I has had better egg rolls from Panda Express. Very disappointing

We ordered orange chicken, garlic noodles, egg rolls and lettuce wraps. The one star is for the lettuce wraps because those were delicious. The other dishes fell flat on flavor and temperature. The food was like warm. The rice was super sticky as well. 

Our waitress was more interested in chatting to the booth next to ours (the men were either employees or friends of another staff member because they all seemed to know them). We waited a long time to get beverage refills and our check at the end. 

Based on flavor, service, experience, and price I probably won't return or recommend returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"GREAT WALL OF SALT

We came here late on a Saturday night, after a long day of work. We were starving and just needed food. PF Chang's would not have been my first choice but one of the guys in our group was vegetarian, so we had to play it safe. 

We decided to sit outside and do some people watching, while we were waiting for our food and drinks. There was a lot of crazy action on the strip.  Hey it is Vegas and every night is crazy.  The strange thing we noticed was that everyone stops to take a photo with the PF Chang Statue in front. Why? Those people aren't even eating here. Do they show there friends back home a photo of them standing on the strip in front of the PF Chang's Statue? Vegas tourists can be a little weird. 

Our waitress Kristina seemed to have a little attitude but then we found out she was originally from New York and that explained a lot. I know that sounds bad but I mean it as a compliment.  She was sassy and full of attitude but then after realizing she was from NY we knew she was actually being nice.

I started my night out with the organic margarita. It is one of my favorites. In fact, I make these same drinks at home. Yes I stole the recipe from the PF Chang's in Mountain View, CA.  My coworkers all went with Mai Tai's. We totally needed drinks after our long day. See most people come to Vegas to have fun. For the last 20 years I have been coming here for work, so I really do not know what Vegas fun is anymore.  As you can tell because I am getting excited about an organic margarita. Look out Vegas I am on fire.

We then decided to order a bunch of food. We started out with the two orders of the lettuce wraps...one chicken and one veggie. The tofu in the veggie lettuce wrap was disgusting.  We also got a tuna Tataki, which was really yummy. My favorite part was the jalepeno on top. I always like some spicy to my food.

For dinner we decided to grab a variety of dishes. We ordered the shrimp, chicken & pork fried rice, Chang's spicy chicken, Tofu Pad Thai and the Kung Pao chicken extra spicy. 

Everything was edible but extremely salty.  We needed a couple of rounds of water to wash the salt down.  Honestly it was almost hard to eat but we were so hungry we just kept going. And I was not the only one at the table that made that comment, so I knew I was not being salt crazy.

I would like to feel like I know authentic food.  One of the best things in my life was getting to work in Asia and actually getting to experience the amazing food. But the bad part about these experiences is that it ruins the taste of most of the Asian food available in America including chains like these. 

To recap my evening here: Our waitress was great. My drinks were delicious but the food was just okay. I can hardly believe, at one time, I was in love with PF Changs but I am just not in love with it anymore. I wish I could share more but I just wasn't that impressed.  I honestly don't have that much to say, which is strange for me."}
{"text":"The pictures are going to have to speak for me today because words can't describe how good this place was today.  Service beyond 5 stars and food was well beyond 5 stars ... This is the location right here."}
{"text":"This is where we held the SMX Social Media Epic Dinner AZ .... the staff was amazing.  The food was even better.  I loved doing it the way we did because I got to try a lot of dishes I would not normally order.  Lots of food and dessert and everyone left happy.  Again, I can't thank the staff enough ... they were amazing and paid attention to detail.  Our waiter specifically was awesome.  I forget his name, but he was the one who could pick up an odd shaped M&M with chopsticks .. YOU ROCKED DUDE!"}
{"text":"Used to visit PF Chang's many times in the past... a lot of things have changed their portions are smaller and the quality of the food doesn't seem to be the same. The rice came all in one bowl (brown and white rice) . And the meals came out  warm not hot.
Service was really good though."}
{"text":"I really expected better from this high-end expensive restaurant.  The food was definitely not worth the money. I won't be ordering from here again. The food was over an hour late, the Mongolian Beef was not only very dry, but a very small portion. Really not worth the $18. The other food I ordered was very dry as well and the cup of wonton soup came with 2 tiny wontons. Very disappointed beyond belief."}
{"text":"Located in the Waterfront area, where there are nice shops and entertainment, PF Chang's is in the center of attention as a restaurant in the area. The name alone, which has established a place in serving premier American Chinese food, already brings in so many people.

My past experiences at PF Chang's have been okay, but I was really disappointed with my visit here. Not only was the service super slow, but I felt that the waiters didn't really care to check in on my group and see if everything was alright. Then, the food was also really underwhelming. Everything tasted like it came straight from the microwave, or was salty beyond edibility. The dishes with sauce were absolutely drowned in sauce, and the meat was very tough to eat and not juicy and tender as it should be. For their chicken dishes, the meat is really dry and the outer shell is not crispy.

Poor service and low quality food doesn't deserve to have the name of PF Chang's on it."}
{"text":"On our last day in Vegas, the b/f and I wanted to get a nice hearty lunch, so P.F. Chang's it was.  My first statement as we sat down was \"we have to get the lettuce wraps.\"  And my statement to you if you've never had them is \"you have to get the lettuce wraps.\"  They were just as good as usual.

We had a nice time.  Our server was good but quite talkative.  I'm sure he was just trying to be sure we were having a nice stay but he just did a lot of talking when we wanted to have a nice lunch to ourselves.  So not really anything wrong, just too much.

The boy got the beef and broccoli lunch portion and it was good.  I got my usual low mein with shrimp.  It's my favorite so why get anything else.  

Alll in all, had a nice time here and the food was good like it is at other PF Chang's.  

I should remind you...if you are looking for authentic, remember that this is a chain restaurant in America.  You get my point."}
{"text":"The day I was there I witnessed 2 hostesses walk out. This was after a manager yelled at one of them in front of customers. The phone was ringing for about 20 minutes and management was nowhere in sight. There appeared to be a lot of tension, which made the experience awkward."}
{"text":"I haven't been to PF Chang's in awhile.  Their lunch menu is interesting...  not a great selection of healthier items on the menu - I would think they would at least list the calories so that people who are watching their weight could pick lunch via that route.  Their portions are definitely smaller than before.  Service was ok...  nothing amazing.  Value is pretty good...  our lunch was $30 with tax/no tip.  My friend ordered one of the lunch bowls and I ordered the beef/broccoli entree with a Diet Coke."}
{"text":"Please be sure to call ahead and get the correct pricing before placing your online order. They don't have updated pricing listed on their menu. I'm not talking about a few cents. More like a few dollars. They offer spring rolls for $3.95 but will charge you $4.50. Kids Lo-Mein meal is currently listed for $3.95 but will cost you $4.95."}
{"text":"I've always liked PF Chang's and, generally speaking, this location is pretty good. I typically opt to sit at the bar, where the service has always been extremely personable and fast.

The food is typical PF Chang's: delicious. As one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it's also nice to know that I can go there and eat somewhat healthy (I'm all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). While some complain about the portion sizes being too small, I've always felt like they were perfect. I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of \"Chinese\" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it's never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. I've tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entrées and have never been disappointed.

I've only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that I've gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. I was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. I'm not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. After sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., I finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. I had never experienced something like that, but I received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily I wasn't in a rush that day, so it worked out. The experience would've made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn't outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones.

The only other knock on this location - and it applies to every PF Chang's I've been to - is the insane wait that you'll encounter at dinner time. My wife and I would actually go there more often if we didn't have to wait forever for a table. I love PF Chang's, but I hate waiting more. If you live close enough, get curbside pick-up, or just find somewhere else. I've yet to meet a restaurant worth a 2-hour wait. PF Chang's, included."}
{"text":"As far as P.F. Chang's locations go, this one is really good. I've never sat in the main dining area - opting for the bar seating every time - but I've never had a bad experience at this location. 

As Faith A. said below, Stephanie is an incredible bartender/server. I can't actually speak to her bartending skills, but her server skills are excellent! She was incredibly observant when the sun was bothering my wife's eyes as the sunset reflected off of the mirror behind the bar. Without even asking, she recognized the issue and closed the curtains on the opposite side of the bar. Add to that her ability to keep up with my rapid consumption of their iced tea and a pleasant attitude, and you're looking at a great server!

As with any P.F. location, get there early or you'll likely be waiting forever...or do as we do, and take a seat at the bar or at one of the first-come-first-serve tables in the bar area. If you're lucky, you'll get Stephanie as your waitress. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was NOT impressive! I asked for a corner table which was unoccupied, for my mom and myself, but the hostess said something about it not being available. The freaking row of tables there was empty!!
After we were seated and placed our order. A couple came in and long and behold the hostess gave them the table I wanted! There was no reservation whatsoever at this place so WTF?????"}
{"text":"So this is our first time in PF Chang. First off, this is not your typical Chinese restaurant,the prices are a little higher than a regular Chinese places,it's Asian with a Western touch,they got different varities and I was surprised they got ribs and varities of seafood dishes. 
So we were the first customer so they put us in a booth,the booth was very comfortable,however they put the next customer to the next table right next to us. Now we gotta whisper and try not to be loud and be considerate. 
Our server Taylor was nice,our calamari was delivered on time,my husband got a refill for his rootbeer and she changed the glass too. 
Ok now with regards to the food,we got calamari as our starters and I'd say it was very  tasty however the serving was small,it was a plate with ricestick at the bottom and calamari on top. I ordered the signature lo mein (shrimps),comes with rice. Being Asian,the pancit or lo mein was delicious and the serving was descent. I recommend it. My husband ordered honey chicken comes with rice and addtl pork spring roll. I'd say the serving was very little. It's probably 1/4 portion of the usual servings you get from other Chinese restaurant. He said it was ok. Overall experience was good,we will probably come back to try other food."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with 2 colleagues. Meh! 

The Mongolian Beef was way over cooked, about as brittle and bad as that Panda Express \"Beijing Beef\" crap. My friend's order of shrimp with snow peas was typical and nothing special, something I could have got for half price at a Chinatown dive.  My other friend ordered fried rice, which I didn't try because I prefer white rice. Didn't look like anything special, just filler for the mid-section. PFC does offer brown rice as well. 
My friend is Asian (Korean) which surprised me, because most Chinese don't eat fried rice at all, or if they do, they are just making something out of leftover rice and other dishes at home. I thought only non-Asians ordered fried rice in the restaurant? Well, I take it back, at Panda's I order half noodles, half fried rice, because it ir right there in front! 

Once again, if you like poorly represented Chinese food in a well decorated environment with a lot of other non-Chinese, and want to pay more for it, this is the place America loves! 

It still cracks me up when the waitress asks us if we need help \"mixing\" the sauces for us! As if they were exotic and strange somehow! 

Uh, the three \"Exotic\" sauces are: Chinese mustard, Red Chili paste, and Soy Sauce! The same stuff you get in disposable condiment packets at Panda Express. And she saw us using our chopsticks already! (Do they ask people if they need help with chopsticks, too?)

I think they should only ask the mixing sauces question if 
A) the people aren't Asian and 
B) they are using forks and 
C) they seem clueless about things in little glass jars that they normally get in little plastic packets!"}
{"text":"It was a total disaster! Our waiter never showed up, waited 15mins until other waiter noticed. This busboy brought out our orders and didn't know how to place the plates on the table. Ordered 3 dishes but one of them didn't show up until i asked for it 15mins later when we were having our last bite and when it came out it was half ass. The host told us that they accept diamond membership card but the waiter told us that they do not accept membership vouchers. Food was under par and too salty. If this is how PFC represents Asian cuisine to the tourists from around the world in Vegas, it's a disgrace. Panda Express does better job than PFC."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here today. That clearly wasn't going to happen. We walked in around 4pm, nobody at the host stand... ok.... minutes later... still nobody in sight. There were 2 tables seated and one customer at the bar - no staff in sight, not even a bartender. Waited a little longer. Walked out. The end."}
{"text":"As always a great place to dine in for asian fusion cusine.  But I enjoy getting takeout from here.  Call ahead and its just as good as if you are eating in.  the take out containers keept things warm and the rice let out a cloud of steam when i got home.  That shows the steamy freshness with which it was packaged up!  highly recommended if u've got the craving!"}
{"text":"Horrible service at the front desk. Their online reservation service doesn't work properly. They don't pick up the phone when called to make reservations. We had to wait for more than an hour after being told it's 20 mins wait time. 
Food was great and waiter who served us was awesome. So that made the wait worth."}
{"text":"Smaller portions, less quality in chicken and the take out process was great- they would unpack and show all of your order- no longer now sadly just another chain Chinese restaurant- next"}
{"text":"Horrible curb side! Order our food thirty minutes ahead and still had to wait for twenty five minutes at the curb side. Completely defeated the purpose of curb side ordering. Then they did not provide forks or napkins."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The changs spicy chicken is amazing. And they have this adorable girl named kayla that will bring your food to the car. Nothing beats that"}
{"text":"I'm only here...still waiting for a table because I have to use a gift card I received. I've watched 6 tables stay empty for 25 minutes. I understand they take reservations,  but their operations flow is slow and the front of the house staff doesn't seem terribly concerned with the starving patrons that have congregated outside.  This review probably won't matter because people love Pf changs no matter what.  I won't return though."}
{"text":"$50 lunch and it would have preferred Panda Express probably.  They forgot an order with our appetizers.  Our waiter only came to check on us at the end of our meal.  One of the soups delivered to the table was the wrong one.  By the time they brought the soup back, we were finished with our meal.  The wonton soup was really bland and only luke warm.  The service wasn't very good, considering we only had apps and soup it took 1 hour to complete the meal service.  I won't ever return to this location, and think I might give up PF Changs for good."}
{"text":"Went to PF Chang's for my sister in laws birthday. The service was amazing, our server Keith was very nice and came back to our table often to make sure we were all taken care of. What really exceeded my expectations was when we explained that our daughter had a peanut allergy, the manager came over to let us know that everything we ordered was being prepared in a complete separate area with fresh oil to make sure nothing gets contaminated with peanuts. All the food came out was delicious and served in round plates to know that it was allergen free. We will be coming back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give 5 stars, but my wife said something is missing. Everything tasted good, but the soup and wings were ready in 5 min, too fast?"}
{"text":"Eh. Just Eh ( shoulder shrugg). Didn't do it for me. 
Had sweet and sour pork, pink under cooked pork in cakey soggy over battered in a dull cloudy sauce.  My husband loves the Changs spicy chicken. Always has.   Guess it's a matter of taste. Maybe it would be easier to swallow if it wasn't so overpriced. You can get the same even better at less expensive places.  I don't mind paying those prices for good food. They changed the place up. It looks nice and less gaudy , now work on the food."}
{"text":"Exceptional service= 5 stars
I'm pretty picky about what I like and appreciate great service.  The staff here went out of their way to make this experience wonderful. I took my parents out, who love Chinese food, for their first trip to a PF Chang's.  I've been to a couple in the US and abroad; this one's decor was nice and it wasn't busy at all (around 3 pm).
I informed the server it was my parents' first trip and she must have told the manager because he came over, introduced himself, then continued to talk a bit about the store and the food.  The staff was happy which really kept the mood up.  If we needed something we didn't need to ask.  When I looked up to find our server someone would make eye contact smile and inform her. 
Oh yeah and the food was great, but that's why you go to PF Chang's, because it's delicious. Beef and broccoli, Beef al Sichuan and some chicken and shrimp deal with vegetables were had.  The first two were so good if made the chicken/shrimp dish seem lacking.  Healthy but lacking.
I wouldn't expect that kind of service from anyone, so, well done.  Thank you for treating my parents so kindly. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here until yesterday. We came for a work lunch. Ordered the Vietnamese noodle salad. The description did not match the dish itself. I like cold noodles and spice but this was inedible. Chewy rice noodles, hot sauce and too much lime/acid. I had to send it back and I never do that. I ordered buddahs feast to take back to work and asked for it stir fried, but it was steamed, i.e. no sauce, flavor, or seasoning. There seemed to be a lot of mistakes with our orders. While our check was adjusted, a visit from the manager would have been nice."}
{"text":"Located in Planet Hollywood Hotel Casino on the Famous Las Vegas Strip, this is a chain of Americanized Chinese food, that being said this visit was my first and a little bit not great. I am willing to give it another shot and I will update this review accordingly. The service was incredibly slow, my water was never refilled. The food once it arrived was not hot. The 'Cafe latte\" was in fact coffee with milk, that is cafe ole, for those of you keeping score. The soy sauce would not come out of the unclean and clogged container. As I said I will go again, and update my review, but they have some work to do. If I could I would give it 2 1/2 stars but I can't so sadly I must round down.  Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"I love PF Changs and this location is great. Not much different from other locations but is a bit more pricey. 

Service is great and is in a great casino."}
{"text":"The food is always good here, I was very pleased my last visit with their staff & service as well. They have a great vegetarian section of menu:)"}
{"text":"Yuck!! My wife and I went to PF Changs tonight for dinner.  Oh my gosh both of our dishes were horrible.  My wife got the honey glazed chicken and I got the Sichuan Beef.  The chicken had a bitter/sour taste and my beef was so dry it was like eating beef jerky.  The freakin rice was so dry it was like hard to pick up with the fork.  The only tasty dish was our appetizer lettuce wrap.  Our server was pretty cool, nice guy, attentive and speedy.  Even the stupid fortune cookies were stale.  $50 later I regret trying the Philips place version of PF Changs.  The National Brand would be highly embarrassed with their name associated with this wretched food.  Caution to anyone having that craving for good upscale Chinese food.  Go grab a burger or something."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent customer service. Our server, Ryan, made my friend and I feel welcome and valued. Would highly recommend to any epicurean."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. Was not my choice but i got outvoted. And i gotta say i was not disappointed. Drinks were alright, i had some funky ginger beer. Appetizers were tasty, if not somewhat greasy. My hot-n-sour soup was not bad, if somewhat too vinegary tasting. Wife's Singapore Noodles were pretty good. Tiny dessert samplers ( $2 a pop ) were quite good and tasty.

I think they changed their menu very recently as they have some new items i never seen on their menu before. And that is cool. 

Anyhow, it was pretty good dinner finished off by nice dessert. It was not perfect but pretty good never the less.

\"I like:"}
{"text":"This is a first time to this venue. I've been to the one in Tempe and Chandler. 

The interior was nicely decorated which made it look somewhat upscale. We were surprised that when we sat down, the gal asked if we wanted chopsticks and had a nice wooden box containing chopstcks which we chose from.

The server came by and before taking our order wanted to know how we liked our sauce spicy or mild. My wife said spicy and the server mixed it right in front of us. We didn't use the sauce at all.

My wife ordered the Dragon Eye Oolong tea and although she liked it, I didn't. I'm not a fan of flavored HOT tea.

We started with the Ahi Tartare which was like POKE on a chip. It was definitely different and tasted pretty good.

My wife ordered the Kung Po Chicken and I had the LoMein combo. Her chicken dish was loaded with chicken, but were was the vegetables?? I had a pretty good portion of noodles and meat, but where was the vegetables?? The only veggies we saw was sprouts, thinly sliced celery & carrot and scallions.

The portions were good and the flavors were there.
Unfortunately, I had to ask for water even though I place my empty glass at the edge of the table. Maybe, they were short of staff that night."}
{"text":"We needed a quick lunch before the convention resumed and the service was excellent.  The food was also fresh, tasty, and the presentation was outstanding.  Our waiter also spilt the bill between the four of us with no hassle!"}
{"text":"I went thwre with my family.  It was an awesome experience.  Place was busy but very efficient service.  We were seated in 3 minutes of our arrival.  Place was clean and very well setup.  Our server was very fast and friendly.  Order was taken quickly and food came out in no time.  Had great time there.... Great place to have dinner with friends and family...."}
{"text":"First time ever we (my family and I) went there.  Place is really awesome place - very warm and welcoming.  Clean and awesome view of Las Vegas Strip.  We got seated by windows but right outside of kitchen door - was kind off HUUMMMM.... Staff was very understanding and happy to serve you.  We ordered vege noodles and lettuces wrap - food was just awesome!  We sure will come back for more...."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, ordered crab cheese wontons. They were amazing! Also ordered honey chicken with fried rice. The chicken was good, very crunchy, and a big portion, the rice was a little sad (I attached a photo, sorry it's half eaten). I was expecting some vegetables in my rice.... it was lacking. The Mongolian beef has a nice flavor but very chewy. The staff was friendly. I would try it again if I'm feeling like eating your generic Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"PF Chang's is always good for when you're craving some Chinese! They have a wide variety of dishes, from chicken, beef, shrimp and sushi. 

If you sign up for the rewards program (free to join), you start with 1,000 points and every 2,000 points you get a free entree... it 10 points for every dollar. So essentially every $200 you spend you'd get a free meal. Through the rewards they often email out coupons that are good Mon-Wed.

Would always recommend checking out PF Chang's."}
{"text":"And the adventure begins to P.F.Changs.......

On this adventure, we carefully chose our 2:45pm time slot, Just after the church crowd, and just before the early birds who retire early for the evening. 

The number of guest in the restaurant were few, although we did notice a few smaller groups in the right side of the dining area, the left side was quite empty.  The view from the entrance allows you to view the kitchen, and it was bustling with food, and servers appeared to be quite busy moving the food out of the kitchen window.  We did witness a first hand accident which occurred at the kitchen doorway, which resulted in a loss of a few meals and dishes......I guess someone else in the restaurant was also on an adventure. I would refer to this as a detour or unscheduled event.

After approximately five minutes we were seated in the far left of the restaurant, just a few tables over from a party of thirteen.  This is where the adventure begins.......I will have a few rules of visiting restaurants at the end of this review.....

We were approached by our server, whom I will name \"K\", she was very helpful at first, but that is where it ended.  On this occasion we had the Kung Pao Chicken and the Chicken Lo Mein, our drinks were sweet tea, and water.  Let me re-phrase that, our drinks were suppose to be sweet tea and water. Water, check, Sweet tea - negative Ghostrider.  This tea was un-sweet and there were no sweeteners in sight.  After a few minutes \"K\" returned, we requested a few sweeteners, and this sufficed.

Our meal came out in a timely fashion, approx 15-20 minutes.  The portion sizes were nice, just enough for possibly two people to share, or if you are like me, the size was just right for a good hearty meal.  I enjoyed the Kung Pao, it was fresh, hot in temperature, just a few scallions, just enough red hot chili peppers, and the chicken had a nice crisp yet gentle taste.  I would consider this a very good meal and for the food,  I give it 4 stars.  My wife's meal was also very good, the noodles were cooked very nicely, and if there were any complaints it was that the chicken was lacking in the lo mein.....again, the food for her meal 4 stars.

Now the reason for the 2 star review.  The service.  Have you ever met someone and felt, \"Gee I really want to like this person, I want them to do very well, I want them to succeed, I want them to just do what it is that they do best\", but in this case, I was neglected, my wife was neglected and to make matters worse, the table of thirteen near us, was receiving all of her attention.  I drink water at my meals, I drink ALOT of water, at this meal, I had ONE glass of water, no refills, no follow ups, and this water was empty well into the meal.

I had to leave the last of my meal, because I did not have any water to wash down the white rice, which as one knows can be bland, if there is no water to help wash it down.

So here are the rules that should always be followed. ( I broke a few)
1. If the restaurant is empty and you have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated, leave.....leave quickly. (this is NOT a good sign)
2. If you witness an accident involving 2 or more employees which result in dropped meals and drinks, resulting in broken dishes. Leave, leave quickly, that could be your meal next on the floor.  (this is not a good sign)
3. If you are seated right next to a big party and your server is attending to them, you are delightfully screwed in your needs and this is truly not a good sign. ASK for a different server and section....
4. If you can't motion your server over due to the fact that they are so focused on others, and you are unable to view them due to your poor seating arrangement. ( I may want to consider wearing a clown shirt)
5. If your server apologizes to you AFTER the meal, then it may be just a little to late to receive a good tip. This is what I refer to as your OMG moment that you were dreading..... it's called ....the bad dining experience.

So to break this down:

The Pros: 
1 Good Food, (reasonably priced)
2 Nice atmosphere, 
3. Beautiful statues of horses, 
4. Swinging door entrance, and 
5. Good location.

The Cons: 
1. Waiting for an empty table in an relatively empty restaurant. 
2. Mirrors reflected smudge marks on every mirror located in our dining area. 
3. Service, 
4. Service, 
5. And Service

So,  to sum up the dining experience it would have been a very strong 4 stars, but the service brought that down to a very strong 2 Stars. I will be back, but I will be assured that I will be in a different section, and insist on a different server.

{"text":"So it's Las Vegas Chain restaurant dining for me. A four star for a chain is like getting 20 stars for a Mom and Pop place. I know it's embarrassing for an Asian guy like me to enjoy dining at P.F Chang. Paul Fleming Chang that is! That's as authentic as it gets. 

There's really nothing you can complain about, the service here is top notch. Food comes out like a well orchestrated symphony. There's only 2 things I order here and highly recommend. Ma Po Tofu and Kung Pao Shrimp. Both highly addictive items! I'm not sure if it's the saltiness, or the crunchiness or the combination of both.  The Tofu comes with crispy steamed broccoli to make you feel better about yourself for the meal."}
{"text":"It's good, but not great.  Love the lettuce wraps, the chicken fried rice is also really good.  Dumplins are good.  Mongolian beef is decent, but too expensive.  Lunch specials are the way to go to make this place worth the money."}
{"text":"Good service when ive dined in and always tasty food Their honey chicken is sweet and cripsy And the melon and shrimp is a great odd combination We order take out for the shop all the time and we've never had to send anything back"}
{"text":"Very nice atomshpere.  Staff very friendly.  Menu very mice, could offer more options.  Portions good sized.  We had the Orange chicken, was the best I've had outside of Chinatown in NYC.  Also had the Pad Tia, outstanding.  Hot and sour soup was average, but egg rolls (chicken) were very good.  Price was above the average chinese resteruant, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Can be expensive, but my exexperiences have always been good. Ginger chicken and street Tacos are my favorite. Convenient spot if you can figure out where to park."}
{"text":"Food was what you would expect at PF Changs - not outta this world, but it wasn't bad either. We decided to go for their prixe fix of a 4 course meal for $40 (soup, appetizer, 2 entrees, and dessert.) 

Soup: wonton soup. The broth was sweet. It was full of water chestnuts, wontons, and bok choy. 

Appetizer: lettuce wraps! The serving seemed a bit bigger than other places I've been, but something was off. It was missing the smoky wok taste. We also ordered calamari and it was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. It was neither salty or rubbery. Dip the calamari in the sauces that accompany the lettuce wraps and you're good to go!

Entree: spicy chicken and Mongolian beef. The spicy chicken had a nice crunch to it, but it was reminiscent to orange chicken. There was no spice to it, so I had to add some Sambal to kick it up a notch. The Mongolian beef was salty, but a scoop full of rice fixed that too.  

Dessert: you get 1 sweet treat to share, we added another for $2.  So we got the blueberry cheesecake and the salted caramel cake. Both were perfect! They were very light in flavor and didn't make me want to reach for a glass of water. I would've eaten the whole thing if I wasn't full from the last 3 courses I had. 

Service: was excellent! I have to say, I've never had a more attentive server. The restaurant was full, but Glen made us feel like the only ones there. He was constantly checking up on us, making sure out food was coming out in a timely manner, our drinks were refilled without asking, and showed us the proper way to eat lettuce wraps (totally didn't know you mix the Sambal & hot mustard into the soy sauce type sauce. Mind. Blown.)"}
{"text":"The service was so bad....
Arrived after 9 pm, the host was at the bar flirting with the bartender instead of manning his post. It was not busy, we were seated for over 5 mins,  no one came over to take an order for drinks or food. We got up and left and went to another restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever eating at this place. I'll say that I was not disappointed!! Not only was everything fast but our service by our waiter in general was amazing!! 

The food was such big portions and very fair prices. I had plenty to take home for lunch at work tomorrow! I can't wait to return here more and more. 

That was the best hour and a half trip to a place to eat I have ever had!!

Definitely give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"For what it is, PF Chang's is great. Sorry, Yelp foodie friends! But I'll bring my in-laws here any day. Americanized Asian food? For the sake of SOME ease in my life, sign me up!

As a family girl, we can sit anywhere and feel comfortable with our toddler. There's plenty of space for us to pull him out of his high chair and not hit the table next to us, inside or out. Nobody gives us a look when he fusses and the servers are always really nice and helpful. The patio is comfortable, but if you'd rather sit inside, they have HUGE windows that go to the ceiling that the staff will open up on a beautiful day. The managers come by and say hello and won't shy from making sure you're having a pleasant meal.

Happy hour is pretty good too. Split the shrimp dumplings and chicken lettuce wraps with a friend for about $5 apiece. Not bad. 3 bucks for a beer or 5 bucks for a glass of wine and I'm set.

I don't know if they still have them, but don't get their dessert shots. Hopefully they got rid of them way back when I tasted one. Gag. Aside from that, nice work, PFC."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar with my boyfriend for a couple of cocktails in the evening of his birthday ,not only was everything delicious but our bartender Rob was more than pleasant. He made us feel welcomed and even brought out a birthday dessert with candle when we weren't expecting it."}
{"text":"Part of the famous Restaurant Row in Las Vegas @PFChangs provides a pleasant dining experience.

A nice outdoor patio, long bar and of course the dining room. Lots of TVs to catch the games and the service is TOPS!

The food is good, they serve large entree portions small starter portions and the SOUP is ginormous!!

We ordered some egg rolls and crab wontons for starters!!

Fantastic!! Crispy and creamy wontons and the sauce was great too.Plum I think.

They bring you al the sauces and pastes. 

We then ordered entrees-Sweet n Sour Chicken, Combo Fried Rice(Shrimp,Pork and Beef) plus the asian marinated new york strip steak with mushrooms and asparagus.

The food was great, the steak maybe a little overcooked-I like it more on the RARE side. The rice,vegetables,chicken and everything was great.

My only knock on this place....when the bill came for 32 adults 1 kid it was $70!!!! For chinese food I think thats alittle much for me.

I'll definitely be ordering some of the fried rice to go in the future though!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of people after seeing a concert in Planet Hollywood, and we sat down right away even though the place seemed pretty busy for almost midnight.

The server made the whole experience. He was a pro at handling a bunch of drunk stumblers who think they are hilarious (myself included, ok it was just me). It was nice through out the whole time that we were here and made me actually want to go back to one of the PF's in my city. I refused to go because most of the servers are stuck up and they pretend like you can't get the same food at a cheaper faster price at Pei Wei."}
{"text":"I try not to write too much about chains, but we came here for happy hour, we we went too familiar with their menu and we kinda screwed up our order and got way too much food, It was kind of a breakdown between customer and server, but we had to bite the bullet on some of it and still pay for more than we ordered, but they also helped out by knocking off a couple bucks and then giving us free apps the next time were in."}
{"text":"Things started out badly as the manager walked up and took someone who had just walked in and seated them without consulting with the desk as to who was next. 
The service was the worst I have had anywhere. It took 15 minutes to get a drink order taken. We ordered our food at the same time. The drinks arrived 7 minutes later. The food was an additional 15 minutes. The food was not worth the $15.99 for Orange Chicken. It came with a \"large\" bowl of rice to be shared. It was not sufficient for 2 people but the waiter had disappeared so we had to make due. The highlight was the credit card was picked up and returned in 4 minutes. 

My advice is to stay away from here. Your money will be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! We were both tired and not much in the mood to go out so had dinner delivered. The appetizer, Cecilia's Shrimp Dumplings, was OK. The Shrimp Pad Thai was so bland that I had to doctor it up with herbs/spices. While one of us likes very spicy, the other doesn't. Therefore, we didn't order it hot. I would still expect some flavor. We each ordered a mini-dessert. The most disappointing aspect of dessert was how they were packed. There was no consideration for the food and how it would travel. They were both pretty mangled and not the least bit appetizing. The carrot cake was pretty good but the cheesecake made with fortune cookies was just dreadful. If you are going to deliver, have the courtesy to care for the food so it arrives in good condition. 

Lesson learned. Get in the car and go to Flo's. We've never been disappointed with Flo's food. Nobody should regret a meal that they paid over $40 for - ever!"}
{"text":"Always a good place anywhere you go.  It's a solid 4 stars.  I had another great meal here with some co-workers."}
{"text":"After having a long day at work and too tired from everything around me, my friends and I decided to wind down and go to P.F. Chang's. To be honest, their food is just as good as most other Asian restaurants, but what you are paying for is the ambiance. Heather, our server, was more than willing to help us and chat with us as we were the last customers there. Normally, a server would try to get you to leave as soon as possible, but Heather took her time and let us stay until we felt naturally that we had to go. She told us stories, laughed at our horrible jokes, gave us life advice, etc. We told her how we thought the decorations did not fit with the upbeat pop music, how it was amazing the rice was enough to feed all four of us, and how the food was great because she made it all better. 

Yes, P.F. Chang's is a good restaurant with quality food, but what makes it better is people like Heather who are willing to go above and beyond their jobs and make your experience worthwhile."}
{"text":"I was a little peeved that the gluten free version of the Buddha Feast cost $10.50 when the regular version cost $9.50. So you're charging a dollar more to give me the gluten-free version of a veggie, tofu, and rice platter?? Regardless, it's worth it to get the gluten-free soy sauce (which I buy for myself and I know isn't THAT expensive). When my dish comes out, it's literally just steamed veggies and rice. No tofu, no seasoning or sauce. I ask why there's no tofu and the response is that the tofu has gluten in it. When I ask if there should be any sauce (aka flavor) to the dish I'm informed I could've ordered any other gluten-free dish's sauce to go along with it. Thanks for the info now...yes I'll take the GF beef broccoli sauce on the side. The sauce comes out and it's actually tasty so my food was finally interesting enough to eat, even though now I'm extra annoyed at paying $10.50 for steamed veggies and rice and why the menu made no mention that you wouldn't get flavor or tofu. 
To top it all off based on how miserable I feel now, I'm pretty sure the beef broccoli sauce they brought out contained gluten anyway! So I paid more, got less, and still got gluten in my food!?!? 
Not a happy customer. Not going back. Not going to recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Could not have improved the Asian food experience much in the restaurant nestled into an Upscale outdoor mall. 

Starter starter was a Chang's Mai Tai and Ahi Poke bowl. I was the envy of other diners, some of which gave their unsolicited opinions: \"THAT is THE Best thing here!\"

After guests arrive we tested the theory, ordering the Kung Pao Dragon Roll. Great! But not as good as Poke. Ditto Kung Pao Chicken and Lobster & Shrimp rice.

Service was top noch, if a little weird, responding with \"YES, Excellent, EXCELLENT Choice!\" After any request: May I have more water? \"YES, Excellent, Excellent Choice!\" Really?"}
{"text":"I haven't been in a while and i really loved it again. The food is not fast to your table but is as tasty as ever and the service was pretty corteous. I'm glad i came back."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times, but it has been almost a year since my last visit and I was craving lettuce wraps since they make the best I have ever had.

I always get the same thing when I go to PF Changs - Chicken Lettuce Wraps and the Double Pan Fried Beef Noodles. 
However, they are now offering a Pre-Fix menu for 2 for $39.99 and my noodles were not on the menu.  I decided to be brave, and try something new.

Our waiter and I had already created a rapport over my indecision on my drink choice, so I when I asked him about my meal choice he told me to try the Mongolian beef instead while my boyfriend ordered the Spicy Chicken.  He said that I would never want my pan fried noodles again after the Mongolian Beef....so I took his word and tried something new.  He apparently told the cook to make mine extra crispy without asking my preference first - little did he know, I LOVE crispy grilled beef bits. I char my Korean BBQ because I love those burned edges so much (even though I order steaks med rare) so when a full plate of little sweet charred pieced of beef came to my table with a thick sauce I was in heaven.

Our waiter (Nicholas) even suggested next time how I order the Mongolian beef a bit spicier with asparagus to really fit in with my preferences and he was spot on about how I had told my boyfriend how I would like it a bit spicier next time and came with beans instead of 
shallots.  It was like he read my mind!"}
{"text":"My wife had the sea bass $23, excellent 6 to 8 oz perfectly seared on a bed of spinch, I had the shrimp lo mein, very good, lots of shrimp, I think around $18.  I requested \"extra hot\" and the server corrected my designation to something like \"spicy\" and it was great, added hot mustard, and red pepper sauce, excellent, my mouth is still burning.  We left with two large 2 go boxes.

Also had the chicken lettuce wrap, lots of chicken, it was a great opening to a delicious dinner.

4 total cocktails, and the above food, plus tip was around $85.  A little pricy but very high quality and excellent service.

We arrived around 5 on a Sunday, seated immediately, by the time we left close to 6, there was a packed house and a 15 to 20 minute wait."}
{"text":"Whenever my family comes here, we always try something new. We haven't been disappointed yet. I really like their dishes with chicken; the breading is crispy but the meat is tender. The sauces have a very good taste! The customer service is usually very good; sometimes we'll get average waiters, but other times they are nicer and better than the average waiter."}
{"text":"Always good and consistent. We enjoyed the lettuce wrap appetizer and shared a couple of other incredible dishes. The food quality is great. Everything comes out hot and crispy and perfectly prepared. The service staff couldn't be better. They are fun and full of life. Helpful but not intrusive. Great job PF Changs"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly pleased with the food. Orderes the fillet wok dish, worth a visit. 

Service was excellent. Joe at the bar took very good of us. He was pepped up and full of energy but to a point where you want to get away. He made it enjoyable.  I am always impressed with restaurant staff that seem to care about their jobs. If you aren't excited to have me as a customer, then I am not excited to spend my $$ in your place! Great job PF Changs!"}
{"text":"come on.... if you want Chinese, dont go to a chain owned by Americans.  THis is a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Amazing service this past Sunday from our server Laura. We came in late, and they were about to close, however we didn't feel rushed. Laura was very bubbly and friendly and made us feel quite welcomed."}
{"text":"This is not the PF Changs you loved 15 years ago. A must MISS. We came in for the new menu. My former favorite, calamari, was made with 1/2 the calamari for the full price. Yes it had veggies in it, but wait, i ordered protein. We tried the new item,  Korean rice bowl. Stale brown rice, too much sauce (very spicy), not very interesting. Better to go to Bibibop and get the real thing with fresh veggies, spicy chicken and purple rice. I will never come back to to resteraunt. A huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I won't recommend this place.Been to P F Chang in many states/locations.This is bad of all P F Chang locations I visited .Service is not good.They don't care about customers.Did not fill water on our table we kept on asking 2-3 people.Food is not good.Appetizers were good but Chicken and shrimp Mixed fried rice was bad and cold.No taste no sauce no flavor.I can make that kind of fried rice at home .Don't try new Koriyan BBQ Chicken it is specified as spicy.Chicken was dry not enough sauce and not at all spicy.I mentioned to the waitress that fried rice is bad.She did not cared to apologize or even did not let chef know.Very very bad experience.Service was bad they don't care about customers.Avoid this place ."}
{"text":"This was a dual celebration.  My parents 49th wedding anniversary and my parents meeting my love.  First let me say that the food was delicious, the service was lacking.  It took forever for our server to arrive, beverages took more than a few, and our order seemed to take quite a while before they arrived.  It's been a while since I have been to this location, but my guy has visited a few times, likes the food. But the service...not so much.  Honestly I would give the food 5 stars and the service 2.  Lettuce Wraps delicious, Orange Chicken and Kung Pao Shrimp awesome, service...wah, wah!"}
{"text":"The Wonton soup, so worth it..Close to home, nice and quiet."}
{"text":"If I could give my experience here as a to-go order a 0 star, I would.

READ: For all CES attendees 2015, please do not frequent this establishment. Go to Cioppino's (sp?) just down the block - half price, three times the food (and they actually will fulfill your order).

The context:

I called PF Chang's to-go # after a long day of travelling. I waited forty minutes, which wasn't a big deal, and arrived on time. This is on Sunday, January 4th at 8:40pm.

At 9:10 (yes, thirty minutes after I was supposed to be out the door with my food) the bartender told me she \"just entered it into the system.\"

Honestly, this is what happens when a chain centralizes ordering.

I have never had such a cold staff respond to my very even-tempered feedback that it is unacceptable to be thirty minutes late - and not to fulfill an order! I mean, I was just SITTING there for thirty minutes and no one followed up??

Shame on you. I'd fire your manager and the entire chain of ticket-holding for this transaction. I'm glad I left, and got twice the food at half the cost down the street."}
{"text":"Dinner with Friends,

The PF Chang's experience has transformed into more of a drive though than quality food. Our meal service took over 2 hours and each couple had to return at least one item to kitchen (appetizer or main entree).  I've been to other franchise location which are spectacular this location \"not so much\"."}
{"text":"I read a review earlier about pf changs that fully captures my opinion of the place. It's consistent and the food is good and well-prepared. Now I'll admit, my Asian friends and family back home tend to give pf changs a bad rap because its not authentic. And, well it's not authentic. It more asian fusion than it is Chinese, but that's ok. It takes some of the flavors and influences that are more universally appealing and appreciated and makes signature dishes out of those. And it is pretty well executed, in my opinion. 

I've been to a number of Pf changs locations over the years and I like this location a lot. I actually dined here two weeks ago and my wife, friends and I really enjoyed ourselves. The waitstaff was excellent. Our food was fresh and delicious and the bar is decent too. I like my experience there and honestly have never had a bad pf changs experience ever."}
{"text":"We went here for a date night a few weeks back.  One of the reasons we ended up here was because I stumbled across a promotion where everyone in America got a free order of chicken lettuce wraps.  That's all you had to say to get me there...thank you Briny Baird!

It was a Friday night and arrived around 5:30p.  Pleasantly surprised that there was no wait and we got seated right away.  Our waitress did not come around for awhile.  It turned out that she was the same waitress that was at the table next to us just chatting away for a bit.  Luckily, she was just as friendly with us and we were treated just as well.  

Our order was for the lettuce wraps and the sesame chicken, which we had never had before.  As per usual, the lettuce wraps were quite delicious and we cleaned the plate.  The sesame chicken came shortly after we finished, and I really like it.  Good flavor, nice tasting chicken, no complaints at all.  A big bonus was that it was not deep fried, but pan fried chicken.  My iced tea never reached bottom as well, so they did a good job with that too.

Four stars for the good service and good grub.  I'm sure I'll be back to Changs (or Pei Wei).  (Sure it's a chain, but it's a homegrown one, so how could you turn your back on them?)."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experiences I had in a while. The service was incredibly slow. Our first dish was the chicken lettuce wraps. The white noodle crisps that come with the chicken lettuce wraps were so hard and burnt, and when my mom ate some of them in her wrap, she chipped her tooth! We politely told our waitress about it, and she just LAUGHED and walked away. No apology, no \"I'll talk to the cook about that.\" It's like that was her plan all along , and she was so happy that customers were receiving bodily harm from the food. The rest of the food took forever to arrive, to the point where we eventually had to find SOMEONE that passed by to ask what was going on. The sea bass that arrived was the worst cooked fish we've ever tasted. It tasted old, rough, and the spinach it came with was the worst spinach ever (the sauce tasted like a cigarette,  the spinach was raw, and parts of it had giant amounts of salt piled on!). I mean, how do you screw up spinach? I've tasted this same dish at the P.F. Chang's at King of Prussia in Pennsylvania, and it tastes so much better and so completely different. Our mongolian beef dish here was very rough and again had an overwhelming amount of burnt white noodle crisps. The only dish that was semi-edible was the beef lo mein, and even that had a lot of salt. Our waitress eventually came over to ask how we were liking the food, and we hesitated. We could kind of predict that she would just laugh and walk away. But she kept standing there, so we eventually told her the spinach was too salty and under cooked. And guess what - she laughed and walked away. Again.

Awful service, awful food."}
{"text":"Martino is AMAZING!!!!! BEST SERVICE we've had in a long time. Very attentive, kind, and overall, such a wonderful guy! When I asked for his manager so I could tell him how wonderful our service had been, the manager informed us that Martino is a NEW employee. Whoever trained him should get a pat on the back as well. No one really thinks about asking for a manager to compliment great service. They tend to ask for a manager to point out the negative. I was happy to give this young man some positive feedback!!! Keep up the good work Martino!!! While you're here, try the banana spring rolls for dessert...the pineapple coconut ice cream that comes with it is heavenly!!!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this PF Changs weekly but have cut way back on my visits. 

Prices went up and quality went down. 

I'm currently eating the last meal I'll have at this PF Changs."}
{"text":"Wow I don't know what to say but I eat out every meal and I think I just had the best service of my life.  Of course the food was good it's Pf Changs.  But MANNY was off the hook.  Drink refills non stop and just super friendly guy.  WOW"}
{"text":"Not a fan of chains and at least the lettuce wrap is large and all right but otherwise tasteless.  With as little competition in this area you'd think existing restaurants could step it up?"}
{"text":"Good food, a little slow on the entrees BUT our server Sean was sooo good and funny so it was a great experience overall. Beef and broccolini was fantastic. Again, props to Sean."}
{"text":"Came in with reservations for two and was told that our table was being cleaned. Watched other couples and groups come in after us with no reservations get seated before us. I guess if you're not white, you're not a priority here even if you make reservations. After waiting 20 min was told they're still cleaning our table. Ended up leaving to eat somewhere else that wasn't so blatantly racist."}
{"text":"We weren't originally gonna come here (we were gonna go to Joe's Seafood in the Caesar's Palace for some Lobster and Crab, but we were both too Tired to walk through the crowd to go there) so we settled for coming here for Dinner. It was our last meal in Vegas before we had to Pack and go to sleep for our flight back to Buffalo the next morning, so we just enjoyed it (It was my first time actually being in a P.F. Changs). 
We walked in and we were sat down, For our Appetizer we started off with a bowl of Egg Drop Soup (Egg Whites cooked in Chicken Broth) when it came out it was an Emperor Sized Bowl, The bowl was huge it was delicious and I'm glad they added some bite sized carrot pieces for Texture. Then we ordered some drinks, I got the Coconut Lemon Sour (Pearl Coconut Vodka, Coconut Water and Fresh Lemon Juice) Very Refreshing, something to sip on in a Beach Chair (somewhere Tropical like Hawaii). My dad just got a Plain Margarita with a Salted Rim (he said its his favorite drink). 
For our Entrees Dad got the Pepper Steak - Flank Steak, Bell Peppers and Onions marinated in a Black Pepper-Garlic Sauce (Steak was nicely done, I didn't care that much for the Peppers and Onions and we both thought it was a little Salty).For my Entrée I got the Sichaun Scallops - Scallops breaded, fried and then coated in a Red Chili Pepper-Garlic (Perfectly Cooked, Nice Crispy Breading and a good amount of heat from the Sauce). Then I ordered another Coconut Lemon Sour and Dad ordered another Margarita, Service was Terrific, Food was Pretty Good (My first ever eating at P.F. Changs and I had a pretty Good Time), not to mention that this was my last meal in Vegas (for a While). Less than 4 Years from now I'll be return back tasting more of what Las Vegas has to Offer, Who Knows ?"}
{"text":"This place is great the waitress we had was awesome.  Real family friendly and prices were great also.  Would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't so dark inside.  Had to use the candles to see the menu.  Other than that great place to eat."}
{"text":"I like the ambience. Food is decent. Service as like anywhere else it varies. But overall I feel relaxed both times I ate here. They also sell gift certificates with 20 percent off at Sams club which make this more reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why all of the bad reviews on PF Changs, & while I wasn't thoroughly impressed, it's probably the best Chinese food I've had. I'm in no way a Chinese food fan & try to stay away from it as much as I can, but my girlfriend likes it so I can't always say no to it.

I've only had lunch here, but the prices to me are more appropriate for a dinner visit. They have quite a unique, upscale twist on Chinese food & you get some pretty big portions. I've had a spicy chicken dish & loved it & my girlfriend loved her meal as well. As for sauces, they hand mix some sort of tasty sauce right at your table. Everything I had at my meal was tasty & I'll go back again if my girlfriend wants to go.

If I were a Chinese food fan, I'd have given PF Changs 4 stars, but with my disdain for this type of food I can only give it a 3."}
{"text":"We just went for a few drinks. I had a house margarita and let me tell you, the mix was awful and you didn't taste the tequila. I asked the server if he could put another shot in, he said sure. I watched him barely put have a shot and then charged us for a full one. I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and order another margarita but in a short glass, and that one was terrible as well."}
{"text":"Rude waitress and even worse manager. I expected more from P.F. Chang's. Sticking to the one in Houston, where servers remember your side and they don't place your food at the wrong table and give you attitude for saying something."}
{"text":"Do not order take out.  We ordered food through Amazon Prime. The food was haphazardly  thrown in the takeaway bag and PF Changs did not properly secure the lids on the sauces.  As a result, there was sauce all over the bag and the dumplings were drenched in some sauce we did not want.  We called PF changs but they gave us some lame excuse and said it wasn't their fault.  Which is baloney since it is clear that whoever packed the food did a poor job. 

This was a bad experience.  I would not order food through them on amazon prime. And, if I did order takeaway from PF Chana's I would check my food before leaving the premises."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good service is ok 
A must try in my opinion is the dynamite shrimp 
Place has a nice vibe I like the decor will be coming again"}
{"text":"Came here for my Birthday(not my choice)  Food was lukewarm, waiter was non existent and the prices outrageous. No thanks. I don't know why people eat here when there literally hundreds of awesome Mom and Pop places."}
{"text":"I no longer expect a unique experience from this chain restaurant BUT being rushed to order and then receiving food that makes me wish I had just stayed home and cooked myself - well, that's unacceptable. 
I ordered the PF Chang's signature spice chicken plate and the meat tasted like a very tender McDonald's chicken nugget w/ sauce. That bite (piece) stopped me cold ... I could not put another bite in my mouth. The server was subpar. When my friend, a vegetarian, ordered a cucumber sushi roll - she was brought a California roll. The dimwitted waitress informed us that they don't have cucumber rolls. I asked her why she didn't say that when the order was placed - she said that California rolls have cucumber in them so she thought that was what was meant to be ordered. ????what????
 I actually left with a regretful spirit - waste of calories, money, and logic ---  This place is a perfect example of why we need to demand more for our hard earned money. 
Local only restaurants need to make a comeback."}
{"text":"I generally don't review chain restaurants. Standardization of cuisine brings very standard, uninteresting cuisine. I do appreciate that PF Changs offers gluten-free options, a few of which are also vegetarian. It's just that it's not very good. I ordered the Coconut Curry vegetables, the cucumbers and an overpriced glass of cheap wine, and my friend had the salmon (because the server said it was the most popular dish). She said her entree was bland. Everything I had was underwhelming. And the food just didn't sit right with me. The host was friendly and helpful, but our server wasn't very good. I have to go to Phoenix and Scottsdale for work occasionally, but I wouldn't return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We stopped in while visiting friends to enjoy some Chinese cuisine and have to say the food and service lead to a PF Changs experience that has been one of the best we visiting yet.

The waiter was fun and attentive, food was prepared perfectly and they offer a very nice menu.

The restaurant was very clean and nicely decorated.

Definitely a good stop for decent, consistent Chinese food."}
{"text":"Go for lunch! The lunch menu includes all the best dishes at a great price. You can mix and match sushi, lettuce wraps, soup etc or order a meal from the wok. I ordered ginger broccoli chicken with brown rice. It was delicious and just shy of $10 dollars. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Zero stars are not an option.  First time at P.F. Nice building that serves food not worthy of my my cat or dog.   Will never go to any P.F. Chang again."}
{"text":"We haven't dined at PF Changs for quite a while. Menu has been expanded to include sushi and dim sum, not sure when they made this mistake?

Food sucked, sadly it's typical for food quality to diminish when a restaurant takes on more items and loses focus. Our waiter was pleasant, but disappeared once the food was delivered(by another staff member)so it took a while to send back the cold food. 

Like I said in the beginning, it had been quite a while since we've dined at Changs, it will possibly be never after this last experience."}
{"text":"This is the first time we ordered everything from the Gluten Free Menu. We ordered online and picked up a to-go order. The order was ready on time packed well and everything arrived home hot. The only exception was that all but one of the boxes had a large orange sticker on it that designated the boxes as gluten free. Although the nice person that packed the order did read off gluten free before adding each item to the bag I still felt the need to call and clarify that all the food in our order was gluten free. I was told that they had simply run out of the stickers and instead of making us wait just did not place one on our box. Although slightly inconvenient it was worth the phone call and in the end everything was gluten free and there were no reactions! 

The food over all was fantastic with the exception of the Moo Goo Gai Pan. The chicken and shrimp were cooked well but the vegetables were a bit underdone and the sauce lacked any sort of flavor. I am not sure if this was due to being GF or simply just a so-so dish as I have not had the gluten full version. Oh, and we are so glad we choose not to skip the flourless chocolate dome! What a treat, it was more fudge or truffle like and came with a nice portion of fresh summer berries. The menu tends to change with the seasons and that will keep us coming back.

GF CHANG'S CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS

{"text":"We went last night Saturday night to P.F.Chang located at the Kierlands in Scottsdale. Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. My husband's dish was OK. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :("}
{"text":"Last night, Saturday night we went to Kierland P F Chang for dinner and had the worst dinning experience ever!!!! After waiting for more than an hour we were seated starving!!! ordered Calamari for the appetizer which came with a side of salt and pepper and a strange tasting salty sauce. For our main coarse I ordered a simple well known dish of beef and broccoli, my husband ordered a vegetable dish with peanut sauce. After a long wait my food came but it was so salty that was not eatable and I had to tell our waiter and he agreed to change it for a less salt version of it. My husband's meal was OK. after another long wait my dish came, this time less salty but the meat tasted like liver and it made my stomach  turn. It was nasty!!! Now, I believe that is why they put so much salt to cover up the nasty rotten meat taste!!! My Saturday night dinner was ruined. 
our waiter was very nice and sympathetic. I will not go back to this place again."}
{"text":"P.F. Change's top tips:

-Make a reservation if you're going for dinner. 
-There is a gluten free menu section
-Veggie-friendly
-Yummy cocktails (my favorite was the coconut lemon sour)
-Outdoor seating"}
{"text":"I usually run the other way when it comes to chain restaurants, but we've had a $50 gift card for P.F. Chang's that was given to us about six months ago and finally decided to bite the bullet.  I've been to the one on the Strip twice, but that was a long time ago, my only memory being grease, and more grease.  So I wasn't particularly looking forward to dinner tonight.  But 50 bucks is 50 bucks, so...

The economy must have gotten to PFC:  Saturday night and no wait for a table at 9:00 pm.  I settled on a glass of white zin (yeah, I know, Kool-Aid), and hubby ordered a Newcastle on draft.  I see-sawed between ordering a la carte, since the Spiced Lamb sounded interesting, and the 39.99 Four-Course dinner, until the waitress said that the Sesame Chicken on the dinner was really, really good.  So we went for it.

I was totally surprised.  The Hot & Sour Soup, while not overwhelmingly spicy, was delicious, not overly glutinous, and had a generous helping of both pork and tofu.  

The lettuce wraps were very good, and we were offered a second helping of lettuce, since the first batch didn't make a dent in the large portion of chicken and crispy rice noodles.  

By that time we were pretty full, so dinner tomorrow night will be our leftovers:  that excellent Sesame Chicken, and the Kung Pao Shrimp, which was terrific, but would have been even better if I ever could remember to have the kitchen NOT add any additional salt.  Even my husband enjoyed it, and he doesn't like shrimp!!  Best of all was the absence of the pools of grease that I remember from the Strip location.  There was even a lot less oil than we get at our usual New York Chinese Restaurant go-to, and the ambience is a lot nicer.

The Prix Fixe includes two desserts, and there are eight mini desserts to choose from, all served in shooter glasses.  I had the Lemon Tres Leche [sic], which didn't taste at all like the usual Tres Leches dessert, but was astoundingly good, so much so that the little shooter seemed much more dessert than I should be eating.  Hubby had the Apple Pie, and liked it a lot.  But mine was better!!

Our server, Nancy, was outstanding - everything a server should be:  friendly, helpful, patient, efficient, and accommodating.  

All in all, we had a terrific meal in an attractive place, and would have enjoyed it just as much if we actually had to pay for it!"}
{"text":"It only gets two stars because even though food is good at this restaurant the service is hit or miss and it's too noisy.  There are plenty of other restaurants in this area in the same or lower price point with similar food that isn't like walking into bedlam."}
{"text":"Rice tasted like plastic. Service sucked. It was my first and last time going there. If I didn't have a $20 gift card I don't think I would went in the first place. Not a good experience at all. :("}
{"text":"A solid regular for my family and me.  We usually order for take out.  Best option is to buy the gift cards at Costco.  Allows you to essentially get 20% off your bill, jvia a little pre-planning.

My daughter is a fan of the Great Wall of Chocolate"}
{"text":"I don't really understand the buzz around P.F Chang's.
Yes it is a nice restaurant and yes they have good food, but wait a half an hour for a bunch of us who came after work? No thank you!

Unfortunately I was the only one who felt that way. 

PF Changs serves very Americanized Asian cuisine for a tad higher than it's worth in my opinion. If it tastes the same or not as good as my take out Chinese place it's not worth my time or the extra money."}
{"text":"Surprised how empty the restaurant was tonight.   First time at this location.  Great service, but wasn't hard to do.....

Had a combination Orange Shrimp and Chicken and Chicken Fried Rice.  It was typical PF Changs (Very good).  You can get the Fried Rice off the kids menu for $2.95 versus $8 for a big bowl off the regular menu."}
{"text":"The beef in my beef and broccoli was like jerky meat, the sweet and sour soup was foul. My son got a stomach ache after he ate the ribs. Only upside was the friendly service."}
{"text":"The 1 Star is for the Manager tonight!
Our waiter and the Food was 5* Star. 
PF Changs sent me an email telling me that I had earned a Free Entree and to use it before it expired. 
We ordered our Entree and 4 other items. The waiter tells us that the Manager said \"The System\" was down and she couldn't honor my reward. I showed them THEIR EMAIL to me but she said she still couldn't do it. 
The bill came to $58.00 and the Manager couldn't even Comp us our $5 dollar egg rolls?
What a great Manager looking out for the customers! 
I won't be back. I will redeem my reward at another location and find my Chinese food at one of the other MANY restaurants available."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is usually on the slow side. Lunch portions are adequate but they charge $3 for tea so drink water."}
{"text":"Very nice service, good asian (e.g Thai and Japanese) food, quick.
You have good tastes!"}
{"text":"This location is located prominently on a busy corner, but the parking situation is very unfortunate, and when you pull into the shopping center, it's unclear to newcomers where to go (no signs). 

The bar was \"dead\" when I got there on a Wednesday night at 8pm, but the hostess and bartender were both very friendly and helpful.  The drink (a Mai-tai) was very good as well.

The dynamite shrimp appetizer was as expected anywhere else - not disappointed! However, since I was alone, I got the salmon and asparagus dish as I wasn't sharing with anyone.  The first time, the salmon was dry and overcooked.  They immediately apologized, and the manager brought out a fresh dish a few minutes later, cooked correctly, but still very dry and tasting not at all like salmon.  Maybe I'm just used to fresh salmon from the west coast, or really good seafood places (even Albuquerque and Salt Lake City can get fresh salmon). 

In any case, I told the manager that I was being picky, and asked if I could have the Chang's Spicy chicken instead - it was excellent!

Their rewards program is very nice, and the dynamite shrimp is free this month to members (I didn't realize that).

Unfortunately, PF Chang's corporate has not seen the wisdom in bringing back the old \"shot-glass\" desserts as I call them. They used to have about (10) different single-serving desserts that were PERFECT for any size table so that everyone could get a few sweet bites after a large meal. They only have regular-sized desserts now, so needless to say, I did not partake after all that food."}
{"text":"Dear PF Changs , 


  On Sunday the 24th , myself and some family members out of town visited your location ! there was six of us !  Our waitress was awful .. Not paying attention to details and not tending to our table in a timely manner... Giving us attitude and just not providing a great service ! We tried to talk to the manger a tall African American gentleman but he was just as bad ...  When asked where can we make comments about today's he referred me to the receipt! He was not concerned about with the complaints were about or anything ! I then told me live here ! He reply ok!  Bottom line is you can't just expect people to be happy with bad service.."}
{"text":"Hostess was very polite and accommodating to our request for a booth. Our waitress stopped by to say she would be right with us and came back to get our order promptly.

We each ordered from the lunch menu and enjoyed the Chang's Spicy chicken and Mongolian Beef. Even ordered the banana spring rolls for dessert and was pleased to find that they came out hot! I had a problem with coming out cold from other P.F. Chang's in the past. 

Also can't beat the fact that while it's not on the strip it's still close in proximity and easy to get to."}
{"text":"great place, take Mom there once a week, food is good, service is also always good, nice experience. best Chinese food around."}
{"text":"I really love PF Changs!

And no, I don't think its really authentic and that is not even a reason why I love this place! So without further ado, my four favorite dishes.

First: PF Changs, has the BEST chicken noodle soup EVER. Forget the egg drop, forget the hot and sour, try this delicious soup! It's a lemony, spicy-ish, chicken broth with cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, pieces of chicken, cilantro, and these weird looking noodles. It might not sound good but TRUST ME it is.

Second:  the fried green beans...YUMMY! Super crunchy and delicious and the dipping sauce is phenomenal!

Third: shrimp and candied walnuts. OK, I never thought I would like a dish with melon balls in it [unless it was like a fruit bowl] but this has definitely changed my mind! Basically, battered and fried shrimp with this creamy sauce with candied walnuts and melon balls. I can't convince you it's good with any of my words, you just need to try it lol

Fourth: Dalhi Chicken. It's super spicy [spiciest dish] with sliced potatoes. If you don't like spicy, DON'T GET THIS. Try the chang's spicy chicken instead... [which is not spicy to me] lol

YOU'RE WELCOME. ;]"}
{"text":"This was the worst PF Chang's I have ever eaten at. 

I ordered the GF Beef and Broccoli and it was dry and flavorless. I ordered the flourless cake to-go and eat in my room, however it too tasted like nothing. And to top it off, I was sick about an hour later. 

It was also way too loud and cramped inside.

The only reason for the two stars is because our server was nice and because the company itself deserves a star for being so gluten-friendly."}
{"text":"Zero stars! This place was so horrendously dirty today, that I walked out. It was not even busy in the restaurant so I saw no excuse for the disgustingness. The odd thing was that we had tried to eat at the Bellagio, but there were long lines for all the restaurants. We came across the street to try the Burger place at Planet Hollywood, but once again, there was a long line. We see that Chang's had open and available seating so this was our only hope at 2:00 and we have not eaten a meal yet. 

The hostess walked us over to what was clearly a dirty table. I couldn't believe it. I told her, \"No, it's dirty.\" She said, \"I know, I'll sweep it\". Um no, that's gross, you won't be sweeping by my feet. How rude. I said no again. So we go to a different table that at first appeared to be clean but had fortune cookie crap in the seats and tons of wrappers around me. Okay. We sit there and she wipes down the tabletop because it needs it. 

Then I see that the table next to us is dirty too. There are people finishing up their meal but the mess on the floor appeared to be a prior mess that was never cleaned up (most adults don't leave that type/much mess). When they left the wait staff started stacking dirty dishes in a tray right next to me. It was close enough for me to touch. A variety is staff kept walking back and forth around it almost bumping into my head. Wowsers! So rude folks. I didn't have my food yet so I told my husband to pack my food to go. I just couldn't take it anymore.

I left and found Garrett's Popcorn thank goodness because my husband ended up having stomach problems all night."}
{"text":"Greetings Yelpers.   I went to PF Chang's for the first time 2/28/15, due to dead phone battery was unable to check in on yelp.  Me nor my children(4) had ever eaten there before but my husband had but not the location on Rampart and not in the last 5 1/2yrs.  We arrived on a Saturday without reservations (they take and plz make reservations before hand) a little 5:30pm.  The hostess greeted us and advised us of a 40-60 minute wait.  We were in no rush. We waited all of 40 minutes , despite some ppl walked in with no reservation or in parties of 2 or 3 were seated in booths large enough to accommodate 6ppl 2 adults and 4 kids. I was highly dissatisfied where they seated us and requested a manager. Dave the manager listened and re-sat us, not to mention he sent over lettuce wraps which were  phenomenal! David our server who I planned on tipping only 15% because i was livid, earned every bit of the 22% tip. David the server was versed in menu items, drinks, and was so personable we enjoyed ourselves!  Dave the manager was equally as knowledgeable if not more and earned our returned business. Dave was on the floor the entire time checking in on the guest and clearly a support to his team! Awesome food, awesome service, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm subscribed to their email list so I always receive deals and offers for free food which I appreciate. The service is always great and is perfect for a date night."}
{"text":"my dear, sweet Grandma LOVES PF Chang's and this is our favorite spot for any occasion or celebration. Since it's a \"chain\" restaurant, I'll keep it brief with hits and misses.

Hits:
-crispy honey shrimp
-chicken lettuce wraps
-vegetable lo mein
-Dali chicken (super spicy-- yum!)
-manager comping our lettuce wraps because we drive from over an hour away to this location (thanks, manager dude!)
-jasmine blackberry green tea
-beautiful patio, great for summer evenings

Misses:
-shrinking portions (noted on the lettuce wraps and crispy honey shrimp)
-super dim lighting
-difficult to navigate seating arrangements (especially with grandma)
-very noisy, especially if seated by the kitchen
-parking lot jerks. I'd estimate that 80% of people parked over or on the line. 
-wait time. Always seems to be a wait.  

Generally, I love PF Chang's and almost never have a bad experience with either the service or the food."}
{"text":"Went there for a date night.  We did the call ahead seating which worked out great!!  We got seated at our table and the drink host was fast and efficient.  Our waiter however was not.  We ordered the hot sour soup bowl.  When it came, one of the plastic spoons had a noodle of some kind dried up in it.  I pointed it out to our server and he took the spoon (which was in the bowl).  I asked if we could have another complete set.  No apology what so ever.  I had to ask twice for a refill of my soda.  My wife asked how long for a couple spring rolls.  He said 5 min.  15 min later he asks if we were ready for desert.  No egg rolls had arrived yet!  He went to get them.  We waited another 15 min for the check.  Keep in mind all our dishes were picked up.  Finally it came and again no apology for any part of the poor service.  I placed my cc'd down and waited..... And waited..... And then some more.  My wife and I gave up and came up with the cash between both of us.  I did have to go to the bar and ask for change.  That part was fast and efficient!  The bartender even picked up I was a little upset.  He asked if I wanted to speak to a mgr but I declined as we just wanted out.  Well a mgr did find us.  She apologized for everything and did a great job.  I just don't think we'll be going back to that location anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is probably the best bar you can go to in the area, it is a nice higher end place for a drink (I cant stand BWW).  The appetizers are good, food is good, service is top notch but I never think of this place for dinner.  First off, you will wait and more than an hour at peak times and I would rather just go to Pei Wei.  Chicks love this place though so if you are single I recommend eating here everyday, ha ha."}
{"text":"This place never fails. I come here pretty often and am never disappointed.

You HAVE TO start with the lettuce wraps. Seriously, these changed my life. Also, ask for the special sauce with them if you like spicy.

The Kung pao chicken and shrimp is my favorite. It has a little spicy kick, but is not unbearable by any means. The spicy green beans on the side make the meal. 

You also need to try the Bomb Pop Martini. It is not on the menu but if you like a sweet, fruity martini, then this is for you. They make it upon request!

Our server this evening, Kristina was AWESOME. She was sooo nice and personable. She really did a great job!"}
{"text":"Always professional well balanced atmosphere. Haven't had a bad experience in my numerous times being there."}
{"text":"When did this place get expensive?  Small portions and pricey lunch.  Had 2 children with me and our lunch was $47.  I can't think of any reason to go back for this average food."}
{"text":"Food id great. Service -- provided by Melanie-the first time we were here was fantastic. Monday night with Wendy, not so much. Never came around to check on drinks; took forever to get our check. She was busy chatting with 3 other waitresses for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Sad to say that although their menu has been revamped and look really nice PF Changs quality of food and service has gone down. I initially ordered the Kung Pao chicken which came out dry and just did not taste right. It was then replaced with the honey chicken which was decent but nothing to write home about. House Lo Mein was decent, probably could have went to Harris Teeter and got the same thing if not better. Service was slow (not our waiter) and we Only had 3 in our party and it was 230 on a Sunday afternoon, restaurant was not even half full. Sadly we will not be returning anytime soon, especially after spending $80 on something we could have picked up at our neighborhood grocers. I hope they get better."}
{"text":"This seems to be good if you are not used to going out alot to fine dining places. It has a good atmosphere , cheap food but can still feel like you are going out for a night on the town. 

People rave about the lettuce wraps , which I find very blah, but I cant think of anything that truly stands out with any of the food here. 

This is a very safe place to go if you are with semi picky eaters or people who are on a budget. The kierland commons location I find a bit better because the area outside can be nicer for groups or in a date setting  with the fountains and courtyards. 

However , if you are eating healthy, even the healthly menu will leave you felling weighed down. 

You are better off eating at Ra for a lighter meal."}
{"text":"I've heard that this place is not really owned by asian people, but americans. LOL.... 
 If you want authentic asian food, support the little mom and pop hole in the hole asian restaurants. I like their food though."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! Server was able to print a specialty dairy allergy menu in moments. All hot food was served hot and cold was served cold. Sometimes both were part of the same dish. Presentation was simple and easy. Food was delicious. Wide selection of dairy free menu items. Waist staff even suggested a more cost effective method of having the same meal. Her suggestion saved us 8! Restaurant and bathroom were clean. Tables were spacious. Menu had a wide range of prices. I would definitely recommend to a friend."}

{"text":"Love to lunch at Changs, who would've thought that lunch here would be amazing and affordable. Excellent service as well, we were in and out during our 1 hour lunch. (Greg I think) was attentive and speedy."}
{"text":"I love PF Changs. Usually a very solid choice. Not this time...

I took my 15 year old nephew here for his birthday and it was his first time eating at PFC. We had been shopping and running around all day so we were starving.  He asked me too order for him cause he didn't know what to get. 

So I got the chicken lettuce wraps, fried rice, orange chicken, edamame, and a sushi roll. 

They brought the lettuce wraps out with the Fried rice and orange chicken. My nephew and I both made a wrap and devoured it. My last bite of the wrap I noticed something strange as I'm chewing; In my head im thinking is this a mushroom or maybe tofu and then start to realize something isn't right!?!? I spit it out on my side plate and it was a huge chunk of RAW CHICKEN! I started digging through the dish and almost the entire dish was raw. I almost puked. 

I called the waitress over to the table and brought it to her attention. Mind you the restaurant was full and I'm trying my hardest to not make a scene but guests around me can hear the waitress and I talking about it and they proceed to start digging through their dishes.

The waitress took the plate away and grabbed the manager. I do want to say that the waitress was extremely nice and very helpful however embarrassed.

The manager comes over to my table and expresses her disappointment and said she will fix it immediately. Keep in mind the rest of my food came out at the same exact time as the lettuce wraps and during this whole ordeal it's sitting there getting cold. 

I could keep going on and on about my experience but long story short they did nothing but take off the lettuce wraps off of the bill. The least they could have done was comp the measly $50 bill. 

Very Very Disappointed"}
{"text":"There are some entrees that the restaurant chain P.F.Changs does well, and it does them consistently well across multiple locations. They have a few signature dishes like the Pepper Steak, Dali Chicken, Singapore Street Noodles, Grilled Salmon, etc. that are good and they taste the same no matter at what location you eat. About once or twice every year, the restaurant comes up with a seasonal menu and usually most of the items on that menu are good.

There is really nothing in the menu that makes you love or hate a restaurant chain like P.F.Changs since chains like these usually come to the rescue when you at a new location or just too tired to venture out and try something new. It is for this reason alone and for its consistent food quality that I like P.F.Changs."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place!! We had such an excellent lunch today, didn't stop eating till after we paid! Started out with our absolute fave, won ton soup. It's a nice broth with won ton dumplings, chicken, spinach, mushrooms, and water chestnuts. For $7 you get enough for 3 adults! We got lunch specials which come with a soup or salad, we both got salad. I loooove the dressing! I had caramel mango chicken with brown rice and it is spiiiiiicy :) the menu does warn you! It had white meat chicken peices in a spicy sweet sauce with mango, red onion, tomato, and slices of red chili! Hubby had their combo fried rice which is a fall back favorite! Rice, carrots, bean sprouts, beef, chicken, and shrimp cooked to perfection! They aren't cheap with the protein either!! For dessert we had the great wall of chocolate!!! Super moist and decadent perfect for all 3 of us to share. I will be going back here, hopefully soon!!! For 2 adults and my 3 yo the check was $52 and that's with an $8 tip!!"}

{"text":"Hadn't been to PF Changs in over a decade but it was a friends birthday dinner and I came in after a long time. If it wasn't for the birthday dinner I wouldn't have come.  But while I was there, I did order a couple of vegetarian dishes and was very much disappointed.  PF Changs is overpriced & doused with soy sauce Chinese food.  I still have no idea what customers like so much about this place.  To see how much sodium is in their food, take your blood pressure before and after you eat there, you'll see the results yourself.  I was very surprised to learn the chef does not use MSG in the dishes but it didn't compensate for the lackluster flavor.  Its not authentic Chinese food, but if you're in the mood for watered down Chinese food and high blood pressure, this is your place."}
{"text":"If you want this type of Chinese food, buy Panda Express, purchase some cheap wine, go home, turn on 94.1, dim the lights to almost pitch black and light a candle. Viola! You're in PF Changs! Kinda! You'll save a ton of money and gas, for sure. 

But seriously, the food was fine but portions were small and not meant for sharing. The only standout was the chicken lettuce wraps (buy them during happy hour!). At least our waiter was fun. Super sassy and friendly, Lawrence was a joy to be around. Ironically, he reminded me of another Lawrence, the no nonsense best friend on the Real Housewives of Atlanta. But I digress, stick to Panda Express or Pei Wei if you want this kind of food."}
{"text":"The service was good and the place looks nice, but over priced for some little lettuce wraps and a pile of bland steamed vegetables. I was confused as to why this was supposed to be Chinese/Asian Fusion (cuz I'm sorry but THAT'S NOT Asian) until I confronted Dr. Google who said it is an: \"Asian-themed US casual dining restaurant chain\". 
Ohhh! Okay... \"Asian themed\", got it.
Still sucks though."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this one.  The service and people are nice and easy to talk to.  I had the a Mongolian beef and was delicious, the want tan soup and egg trolls we're great as well.  We got those right away. The wait for the main  course was more than 20 minutes plus or so. The atmosphere very enjoyable. Just the timing too to long, but if you don't mind the wait it should be a fun place to enjoy."}
{"text":"We had the worst experience here.  It took forever for anyone to come to our table.  It was a Sunday at 3:00 and there was barely anyone there (now I know why...).  The people working were good if off, totally unprofessional including a lot of screaming and laughter coming from the kitchen.  Then couldn't leave because we couldn't get anyone to give our our check.  Really bad... Don't go to this location.  The reviews are consistent on service."}
{"text":"Pork dumplings pan fried. You won't regret it.


We have come to this P.F. Changs a few times and the food is normally great. This specific time we came it was all terrible. We were seated right away which was great but the server seemed kinda out of it. He kept forgetting what we ordered and sat down in the booth while taking our order. The food wasnt very good at all, I was very disapointed in this expereince. I will probably continue to eat at P.F changs but maybe another location."}
{"text":"When I lived in Los Angeles a year and a half ago, P F Chang's was no great shakes, one of millions of places with good but not outstanding stuff on the menu.

Here in Pittsburgh, it's the only Chinese place I've found that combines genuinely good service with quality food.  Not, perhaps, as good as what you can get in LA's top places, but fantastic compared to its competition here.

The Kung Pao chicken is particularly good, with delicious fried chicken cubes and the usual hot sauce and chiles.  Chicken with lettuce wraps is good too.

Their fried noodle dish with chicken, whose name I have forgotten, is addictive but has an odd sauce I don't quite like.  Still, they get the friedness of the noodles right, and there are precious few ... ahem ... no other restaurants around here that do.

Portions are small, so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came.  The minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees.

If you live in LA, forget P F Chang's.  If you live in NYC, I'm sure there are a dozen better places on a single block.  But here in Pittsburgh, it's just about the best place around."}
{"text":"This location of P.F. Chang's was not a great experience.  Every single dish with sauce tasted exactly the same, even if made with different proteins and advertised as different meals.  Really, there was no way to discern between the dishes.  I also got sushi, which was bland and overpriced for the portion.

The tables are incredibly close and made it difficult for servers and patrons to get through, as my chair was sit multiple times.  The server was also a bit robotic, not very friendly."}
{"text":"Came here on my 21st birthday. Was completely ignored by all staff for almost 40 minutes. The manager noticed how I had not been greeted so he said he would immediately put in an order for me and wouldn't charge. 30 minutes later my food came and he completely disappeared from the restaurant the rest of the time. Ended up paying $40+ for mediocre food. Thanks for making me feel special on my birthday, PF Changs."}
{"text":"every time we come to vegas we stop by for happy hour and for the price the food is pretty darn good, the wines are good but the service is Excellent! every time we get great service-it amazes me how consistent they are, sit at the bar and you will get taken care of very well!"}
{"text":"I'm not exaggerating, this was the best dining experience I've ever had and it had everything to do with LEE. Absolutely the best server I've ever had. Polite, funny, courteous, attentive, and completely on top of it. Words can't describe the kind of dining experience he provided. I will come back next time I'm in Vegas if he's working. A+++++"}
{"text":"My indo-Chinese friend and I came here after our parents heard about this \"upscale Chinese chain\" bringing good Chinese food with good ambiance to the masses, and they kept bugging us to tell them about it. 

We ordered the lettuce wraps, dan-dan mien, and roasted duck.

Two things stood out.

When the waiter brought out our appetizer, he asked us if we liked our food mild or spicy. We said spicy, thinking that he was referring to our dan-dan mien. Before we could react, he mixed the appetizer's sauce with mustard and some other crap. Both of us sat there dumbfounded that he had ruined what looked like a perfectly good sauce. 

The duck also left us speechless. When we ordered it, the waiter warned us that duck could be an oily dish. We said that's fine by us (while snickering inside as we wondered what could be better than duck fat). What we got was the most amazingly fat-free duck. It's amazing cause the bird has ALOT of fat. Of course the lack of duck fat (or as Alton Brown calls it, \"liquid love\") meant that it was the worst, most tasteless and dry duck we'd ever had. It really took some hard work to make duck taste bad. You could leave duck unseasoned, overcook it til it's dry and tough; but give us some some salt and the rendered duck fat to drizzle on top and we'd still say it tastes good. 

Needless to say, we didn't say nice things about PF Chang's to our parents.

Despite how shockingly bad the duck was, I'll give 2 stars since the dan-dan noodles and lettuce wraps were average, and it's clean (a trait that's not to be overlooked in a Chinese place, or a place that poses as a Chinese place). 

As a sidenote, I feel a little sorry for the waiter. He looked awkward while explaining to us how Chinese eat their meals \"family style.\" Then again, we weren't sure whether we should feel insulted or amused."}
{"text":"Excellent food and really good happy hour. These locations fills up quick on Friday and Saturday nights so make a reservation or go during the week. Good for takeout also. I like to order my take out, go early and have a drink at the bar waiting for my food. But that's just me."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience.  Food was cooked perfectly, the service was top notch, and the atmosphere was very elegant and nice.  A must go!"}
{"text":"We went on Friday nite so I knew they would be busy when we walked in ( this was my first time ) a lady I guess she was the hostess she asked if we had an reservation we said no she handed us a beeper and said it would be about 40 minutes so 40 minutes later we are taking into a very busy restaurant The appetizers came out at separate times so my girlfriend had her appetizer before I got mine we Must of  had four different people serving us which I didn't understand food was good I will go back just not on a Friday or Saturday night it was like they were so busy they just wanted to get us in and out"}
{"text":"Always a favorite for a late afternoon lunch. Not crowded ( yet)    Great food....
Excellent service. Was there for happy hour yesterday...."}
{"text":"Food is indistinguishable from any of the Chinese spots you can order by meal numbers.  Therefore, it's overpriced. I wouldn't mind paying what I did if it was a good meal but it wasn't memorable."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I have been a fan of PF Changs for some time as a go to option for \"higher end\" Asian food. I was let down this time though . Granted we stopped in during several of the largest trade shows in Las Vegas, so the restaurant was PACKED, but it just didn't seem like anyone was on their game. My friend and I (no, it's not what you think!) stopped in to get looking for some decent, non casino food and we left really wanting. This is one of the \"smaller\" locations it seemed in both parking lot and restaurant size, so that probably magnified the difficulties they had. Our experience started off when we pulled in to the parking lot and were greeted by the valet telling us the only option, other than across the street was to valet our \"big ole truck\". This wasn't a big deal as we didn't want to walk anyways. However, we were a bit irked when the valet told us we needed to get out car, or at least the key within the next hour and a half as they would be closing at 10ish, valet included. I almost voiced an opposition to continuing in as I did not want to be rushed in what already seemed like a packed restaurant...This is VEGAS for crying out loud!
No worries. We did get seated pretty fast as there was only two of us. The waiter definitely got this place an additional star as he was attentive and informative. He got out orders in and going in great order and stopped by several times to refill us on drinks. We ordered a few standbys, Kung Pow chicken and Crispy beef. What a let down! The chicken appeared to be sautéed chicken and peanuts with a little sauce, and my beef was too chewy for my liking. Both made us think that perhaps we had gotten the PF Changs frozen entrée's they now sell in the supermarkets? The highlight for me was the house ginger beer. I must have had three of these damn things. I enjoy a good, unique beer and this was killer! This was a light tasting heff type unfiltered beer with a fantastic sweet/spicy aftertaste of genuine ginger. I might hit up the local PF Change to see if they have this on it's own.
I guess we went in hoping for average to above average and left feeling we got below average from a restaurant chain that makes it's reputation on being above average. I'll give them a second chance, but in a town with almost as many eating options as ways to loose your money, why try again?"}
{"text":"My first impression of the place was it looked pretty with ample of booths and tables,we were seated right away and got a big booth to ourselves.It was a Wednesday night around 9:00 pm so they were not really full.Our Server was all smiles and we took our time to decide what we wanted (considering they close at 10:00).

We decided on Beer(Hefeweizen) and Mai Tai (cocktail with white rum,dark rum and pineapple juice).The cocktail was refreshing and Fruity with the right amount of Rum.It was well made.They also have a Good collection of Wines.

The Crab wontons are lovely i especially enjoyed the sweet and spicy plum sauce they were served on.We also had the Chang's fried rice(take your pick from chicken,pork,beef,shrimp),
Garlic Noodles(egg noodles tossed with garlic and pepper flakes) served with cucumbers on the side and Dynamite shrimp(Crispy shrimp with a tangy sauce).

It was a good experience and i would gladly be back for some Chinese food."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here a few years ago and you couldn't get in the door because of the line. This was the hottest new place on the restaurant scene and everyone wanted to try it. Fast forward to present day and you'd never believe that was ever the case. Chang's is poorly set up as one large open room that's rather noisy. Food came out quickly but was not as good as the Chinese take out we get from sesame inn. Spicy chicken was neither spicy nor very flavorful and had a mass-produced feel to it. Took half home to eat the next day but ended up throwing it out a few days later. Normally one of the great thing about getting Chinese is looking forward to the leftovers the next day!   Another minus was noticing how dirty the floor was on the way back to the bathroom. I don't expect a place to be immaculate in the middle of dinner service but this looked like the mcdonalds on Smithfield downtown.
The one bright spot was our waitress was very good and kept our water glasses filled. We just came from kennywood so we went through quite a few fill ups during our time there. Short of this, I'd probably give Changs two stars. Probably last time I'll stop in here unless I can't get in to any restaurants in the area and need a place I know won't be too busy."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than two stars  because  the food is excellent !   The service, however, sucks.  I also think they are prejudiced against older people.  On several occasions, we have been seated at the same time as younger people - and guess who waits and waits!"}
{"text":"I just can't find any Chinese food that I like better than P.F. Changs in the Charlotte area. I'm willing to pay the big bucks for good mongolian beef since I can't find any edible mongolian beef anywhere else. I also dig their spring rolls, not too greasy and not too big. 

Everyone seems to love the lettuce wraps, I'm not a fan of water chestnuts and they are in there, so I can't get over the texture, but otherwise the lettuce wraps are delish. 

The crispy honey chicken is also good, that is what my husband orders and we split that and the mongolian beef. 

If you don't want to fight the crowds, call in take-out, it's just as good at home in your comfy clothes as it is in the semi up-tight south park location. Seriously people.. it's a chain restuarant, it's not an exclusive 5 star place. No need to turn up your noses.

You get lots of food, good service and a semi-hefty check at the end, but really it's worth every penny.

Call ahead for reservations on the weekends! It's super busy!"}
{"text":"We walked over to Planet Hollywood, and for some reason our friends thought PF Chang's would be a great place to eat.  Now I say that because we have PF Chang's at home, and there are a zillion other places that are new to try.

We had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  We waited outside in the casino area.  In the casino area, there is a window right into the kitchen.  Everyone thought it was unusually for not ONE Asian person to be working in the kitchen.

Our pager went off, but when we got inside, they told us there were two people with the same name and they didn't know which one was the right person, and we would have to wait longer. After another 7-10 minutes, we were called again.

We were sat, and ordered food very quickly.

Everyone's food was correct, and we all enjoyed our dinner. 

There are plenty of other spots around Vegas that serve the same type of food, at less cost, and less wait.  If you are one of the people that loves to eat on the strip, then go for it, because a PF Chang's is the same throughout the country."}
{"text":"Seriously what has gone wrong with this place. I use to feel like home when I came here. The quality of food and service is just garbage. Also to top it all off the GM of this place is walking around in a tank top and jeans WTF!!! I'm sorry in what way is that all displaying leadership skills. So you're showing everyone it's ok to look lazy Oh yea did I mention she was eating with her family and kept giving us dirty looks. Ewww I URGE everyone to dine elsewhere before coming here Spend your money wisely and go somewhere else. I would rather travel 30 min elsewhere than go here. Better believe I called corporate"}
{"text":"Just had dinner with my sister and we had an amazing experience. Jamie was our server and she was absolutely wonderful. We will definitely come back and ask for her. Food was amazing and came out super fast. Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't disappoint me anytime I go. I am not a fan of Chinese food but for some reason, I love this place. I always order the Sangria. It's amazing. Trust me! For the first time I had the sushi here, highly recommend it. It tasted fresh. I will also say I always get the lettuce wraps, I love those things so much, I found a copy cat recipe online. Doesn't taste exactly the same but give me my fix until I can make it back to P F Chang. For my entree, which I took to go, because I was full off the apps, It was the Lo Mein and I added chicken. I took one bite that night and the rest I ate the next day and it was exactly the same reheated. I will be back:)"}
{"text":"The food was good and our server was great until my son complained to her about other staff sitting a few tables over who were cussing very loudly, at that point her attitude turned sour and she yelled across the room from our table to \"Stop Cussing\". After that the staff got up from the table and were peaking around the corner of the server entrance and giving us dirty looks. The environment turned very uncomfortable and we felt rushed to leave. Won't be returning anytime soon, that's for sure"}
{"text":"I will say make a reservation since it's pretty busy on a weekend!  We got seated quickly with a reservation.  Our server was excellent despite how busy it was.  He was also helpful with recommendations and let me sample a couple wines before picking a bottle.  The manager was also great.  We weren't in love with one of the dishes and the manager came out and talked to us about what we were looking for and gave us a complimentary order of what he recommended.  I will say this - they know how to treat their customers. We'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Food at the Planet Hollywood location was good as usual. Awesome seared ahi and spring rolls.

What I didn't understand was why the service took so long and we were at the bar? The bartender seemed to have a hearing problem and we almost had to beg for a check because he just wasn't paying attention. Dude, we're right IN your face.So I took off 1 star for service."}
{"text":"PF Changs is great.  The service at this location is the best by far.  I have never had a bad meal or bad service at this location.  I love the fact that you always see the Manager(s) out on the floor talking to customers.  The only minor complaint I could come up with is that the food portions are a little smaller than the Southpark location but hey that's probably a good thing for my waist line.  Note that there is often lenghty waits on weekends so call ahead seating is a must during peak hours.  This place is popular already but with the mall right next door, it makes it even busier."}
{"text":"So I have been to this particular chain all over; California, Las Vegas etc. But the biggest thing that made the experience was the server. She was cute and very get nice and knowledgable. She was great. Her name was Ashley. She's the type of employee they better hold on too."}
{"text":"Although this is supposed to be a 'bistro', it felt more like a bar. It was very crowded at 1130am, and this was due to the fact that the servers crowded everyone into one side of the restaurant. The food was okay, tasted kind of like Panda Express with nice plates. I ordered the ahi tuna roll, shrimp with lobster sauce and a side of brown rice, fried green beans, orange chicken with white rice, two teas, and a tossed salad. The best part of the meal was the salad. All of the items were tasteless. My server was amazing though and made sure to check in on my friend and I intermittently, our drinks were never empty.

I'm taking away 2 stars because the dining area was dark and crowded. 3 stars for the waiter and how quickly our food was brought out to us. Bill came up to about $65 with tip, not worth it IMO. I won't eat here again,"}
{"text":"Situated almost opposite the Bellagio Fountain show, we booked after the fountains had finished, strolled over the LV Boulevard, had a drink at the bar and then sat down at our table. Seamless on a Friday evening at 10pm in June.

Food is very good for a chain restaurant and portions are huge. Good service and quick too. Ideal for eating but not a night out in itself."}
{"text":"A typical P.F. Chang's experience, nothing spectacular but not too bad either."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Combination lo mein was  undercooked with noodles clumped together and served lukewarm. They did replace the dish and it was much better."}
{"text":"So I've been coming here for years and years. Today my lunch was a little on the salty side. I did provide feed back and I was sent the order again which was beyond perfect. 

I was impressed with their customer satisfaction policy. 
5 stars P.F. Chang's! 

Thank you!"}
{"text":"service is exceptionally good and food is great  A well managed restaurant
Background music a little bit loud but we can live with that"}
{"text":"We had a lunch reservation and were seated  immediately. However, no server came by for about 10 minutes. We had to flag someone down to go find our waitress. We were under time constraints to return to the office. The pork dumplings were greasy and tough. Not a hint of ginger in the sauce. Dan  Dan noodles were okay. I've had better at my local Chinese takeout.  A good concept has declined sadly."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in a while and it will be a while before I eat here again. I ordered through grub hub. I have a food allergy and they called to tell me I couldn't have the green beans because if my allergy. I had eaten them previously and asked out of curiosity what had changed and if they now cook with butter. Five minutes later he came back and apologized and said I was right and the green beans were in fact dairy free. When my order came (horrible service from Grubhub but also a different story) all of my food was cold and none of what I ordered was how I had ordered it. The pad Thai was also weirdly deconstructed so there was a pile of carrots, sprouts, cilantro and huge pile long scallions shoots with the noodles on the bottom. Not at all what I've come to expect when I order P.F. Chang's and not at all worth the price in this case."}
{"text":"I normally don't give places five stars but this place deserved it for the SERVICE ALONE. They really have stepped up the service since the last time I've been there. The food as usual was decent, but our server have us complimentary ginger chicken with our meal as a holiday gift. It was the chefs favorite dish. That alone was awesome service! As if that wasn't enough, then the manager came out and spoke with us for a while. He was friendly as can be. This PF Changs is unlike any other. Service was spectacular!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are frequent diners at PF Changs and we genuinely love it.  We typically steer-clear of chain restaurants, but we always make an exception for PF Changs.  We've been going there for years and we have never had a bad meal.  There are some dishes that we like better than others, but we have never had a sub-par dining experience.   The food is consistently good and the service is always excellent.

My husband and I dined at PF Changs last night (Saturday night) and we brought another couple with us.  I made online reservations earlier in the day and had no trouble getting the time that I wanted (6:30).   When we arrived, the parking lot was expectedly full so we took advantage of the free valet parking.  The restaurant was very, very busy...there people waiting outside as well.  We arrived just after 6:30 and they had us seated within 5 minutes.  

We started with drinks...Blue Moon for my husband, Asian Pear Mojito for me (Delicious!!!!), Bacardi & Coke and Red Wine for our friends.  

For appertizers, we ordered Pork Dumplings and Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  When the runner brought the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, he made a comment that the 4 of us shouldn't have to share just one dish...so a few minutes later he arrived with another dish (and more lettuce), on the house.  Very nice way to start off our meal!   To me, it's those types of gestures that kicks PF Changs up a notch or two and we have had a handful of these types of gestures over the years.   The lettuce wraps were hot, fresh, flavorful, and delicious!  The Pork Dumplings were also very tasty!

On to the entrees...

Tuna Tataki Crisps for me.  They are so excellent!  Round, fried wonton as the vessel, topped with Seared Ahi Tuna topped with diced Ahi tuna, cucumber and scallions tossed in a citrus-sesame soy sauce.  The crisp wonton and the soft tasty tuna are perfect together!  

Mongolian Beef for my husband.  This is the best Mongolian Beef that we have found to date.  The sauce is scrumptious, the meat is lean, tender and moist, and the scallions add a nice freshness to the dish.

Our friends ordered Orange Peel Chicken and Dan Dan Noodles and they both loved their dishes!

For the table to share...

Garlic Noodles (my favorite).  I CRAVE these Noodles!  The menu describes this dish as \"Egg noodles tossed with garlic and chili pepper flakes\".  However, that description doesn't do it justice.  The noodles are tender, the sauce is savory, but not too powerful and it has a touch of sweetness, and it's topped with julienned cucumber and fresh Cilantro.  Outstanding served fresh, even better eaten cold (out of the fridge) the next day....if it makes it that long!   I've been known to order an extra to take to a cookout the next day.

Pork Fried Rice (my husband's favorite).  Everyone has their fried rice preferences.  For us, we don't like sticky fried rice, we don't like it over seasoned (over salty), and we don't like too many veggies (especially the frozen peas and carrots that most take-out establishments like to use).  Chang's Fried Rice is made with egg, julienne carrots, bean sprouts, sliced scallions, and just the right amount of soy sauce.  Perfect!

We completed our meal with a couple of dessert minis...Tiramisu and Lemon Dream.  Both were tasty and just the right size following a big meal.  

Excellent meal, once again.  We all left full, satisfied, and happy.  We will continue to dine to PF Changs over and over again.  Yes, we really love it that much.  The dishes may not be \"authentic', but there is something to be said for consistently delicious Asian-inspired food.  For us, PF Changs is the restaurant equivalent of a familiar and reliable friend.  We all have many acquaintances that we enjoy, but the reliable friends are few and far between.

P.S. I've posted pictures of the entrees."}
{"text":"Horrible Service. There was a half an hour waiting to get seated. Then the server took around 10 minutes to take our order. The plates provided to us were dirty. It took another half hour to get the food. When the food finally came one dish was missed. All our food was high in soya sauce. All in all a really bad experience."}
{"text":"Great food and service was excellent. We rolled in there at 9:15pm when they closed at 10pm, yes we were those people. The staff was very friendly and prompt. We ordered some appetizers and they were very fresh and yummy. The jicama tacos were superb and healthy."}

{"text":"Today was our first visit to this location...We weren't impressed! The waitress was new and didn't know the drink menu...portions were small...Kung pao shrimp had plenty of heat but was bland, dry with no visible sauce and no vegetables but peanuts...there sure were peanuts...at least half a cup. Food also was luke warm. For the price, I've had better take out from our local \"Chinese Restaurant\" at half the price!  Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Went pre theater and pre Tour de Tempe recently and we were seated at the bar. On both occasions the service was lackluster at best. The bar was not clean. There was a cast of characters behind the bar that stumbled all over themselves attempting to serve people but the result of this totally uncoordinated effort was that none of the guests received good service LOL. We waited over 10 minutes for one of our cocktails and it was not a specialty drink. Soup was ok but not hot. Spring rolls were good lettuce wraps were what you expect. The shrimp fired rice dish was terrible. So I am over PF Chang's. Plenty of local restos to support!!"}
{"text":"I am writing this from the standpoint of someone who can't eat real Chinese food because of gluten issues. That said, I am loving me some gluten-free Chinese food here! If the gf issue didn't exist, though, why bother when you can get real, honest, non-chain GREAT Chinese so many wonderful places in the Burgh?!  But average Chinese is better than NO Chinese if gluten is an issue so thank you Mr. Chang!"}
{"text":"This PF Chang's was exceptional! I had the Honeycrisp chicken and it was sweet but not overpowering with the crispy noodles absolutely delicious! The service was kind friendly and helpful and the environment was very very nice. It truly was a great experience."}
{"text":"We started off with a Moscow mule and some shrimp dumplings. Crispy honey shrimp was pretty good I didn't eat it all.  The sauce was a little bitter (for lack of a better word ?).  Hubby had the surf and turf it was good but the turf was well done and should have been medium rare.  Overall it was nice our waiter was attentive."}
{"text":"Total disappointment.. went for my son's 19Th birthday... usually our \"go to\" restaurant because we have food allergies and they are very good about those issues. Food was not good. Kung Pao Chicken was dry and chewy, Fried rice was bland and flavorless. Our server was clueless and inattentive. Place was only about 3/4 full so there was no excuse for the poor service. I am sad to say this is probably our last visit to PF Changs Northlake. I think we may give the Phillips place location a try but it's a long drive from Lake Norman for Chinese food so it may not be worth the drive."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this establishment with my rescue dog but I was informed their patio is now a dog free zone.  I'll be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great service and food was consistent just like the few other locations we have visited! Wish I knew our servers name..she was a doll! Favorite thing to order are the chicken lettuce wraps, Kung pow chicken, crispy honey chicken, crispy honey shrimp and dan dan noodles. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to eat lunch at P.F. Changs Chinese Bistro yesterday (4/28).  I have been going there for several years and I liked it then, but the changes they have made are just great.  The employees there have always been nice, but it seems they really go out of their way to make you even more comfortable now.  When my waiter came to the table to take my order, he asked me if I wanted egg-drop soup or another kind.  I was so surprised because they have never offered soup as part of your meal beforehand and there was no extra charge for it.  They have also changed the way you get your entre.  They used to bring a bowl of white or brown rice for everyone to share and then your entre would be on another plate.  Now, at least for lunch, they call it a lunch bowl and everything is put on one plate.   You are not having to put each item on another plate yourself, like you used to.  Their food is delicious and I almost always get the Crispy Honey Chicken, which I love.  They have a large menu with many different dishes.  I highly suggest if you are looking for a fabulous Chinese Bistro, that you try P.F. Chang's."}
{"text":"Our dinner was excellent.  We love the P.F. Chang menu.  We had very fast service, and very delicous food.  Our server was very helpful and very friendly .  We have been to this outlet twice now.  And the outlet in Waikiki is also excellent.  
I like trying new dishes.  
It is not cheap. But good quality food.  Make a reservation if you have more than 2 people in your party .  It gets very busy ."}
{"text":"As you can tell by my other reviews I seldom frequent large factory restaurants..but, when driving around Keirland trying to make up your mind what to eat at close to 8:30pm,  P.F. Changs to the rescue! 

My wife and I sat at the bar, 45 min. wait for a table was too much...sat next to the service bar, the young lady bartender at this station needs a medal!  She was pouring drinks for servers, talking to servers, bantering with customers next to us, and verbally taking our order without a miss!  Had a good laugh with her regarding the fact a guy couldn't do that! (it was a joke men, really!)  So to say the least service was great!

The food, well....(**insert shrug**), One of our dishes was extremely salty, commented to our amazing bartender and 2 min. later the manager came up to us and said, \"we will make you a new one to go for you, give us a minute.\"  Now that my friends is the way to handle a customer complaint!  Very cool, and I will think fondly of PF Changs just for the way they handled our complaint!

As for the food...from my previous experiences the appetizers are all  good, some of the entree's are overly sugared, but good..noodle dishes are usually good.  My favorite being chow fun."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this restaurant is efficient. What do I care about their level of efficiency? 

1. A short wait for a table
2. Pleasant service by staff who set a tone of order in a large and open restaurant
3. Good prices
4. A well rounded set of dinner options
5. A neatly organized menu with descriptions true to taste

I don't mind supporting the independents when I know where they are, but this week its all about avoiding the hits or misses that I have been enduring in Phoenix over the past 3 months.

I wasn't expecting authentic chinese food- its a chain so if you go in with that expectation then I think you need to do your homework on the meaning of \"chain restaurant\"....

Wish I could have tried more items on the menu. What I did get was excellent- crab wontons, steamed dumplings (can't remember which), and a double pan fried noodles with shrimp. No leftovers on this trip!

Oh, and a PF X. Went down well enough to order a second.

So, my white-bread bottom will be back at this restaurant in the future :)"}
{"text":"One of my more decent meals in Vegas. But why is everything so salty? Not to the point that it's inedible but almost so. but comparably much better and priced more reasonably than the Asian fusion restaurant Dragon Noodle Co. in my hotel (Monte Carlo)"}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon, we were buffeted out and Dennys was a long wait. Remembering positive P.F. Chang's experiences, we gave it another try.
  The visit started off positive, when there was no wait to get in. We sat in an elevated booth, with a good view of the football game on TV.
  I was satisfied with the shrimp lo mein, and shrimp fried rice. I had one gripe with the won ton soup. I felt that a bowl that serves three people was short on won ton.
  In my opinion, this is a restaurant that is ideal for eating with others. It seems that popular Chinese food staples including fried rice and won ton soup are only served in family size portions.
 The visit ended off positive. One day we'll probably return here when my family is in town."}
{"text":"I went to an engagement dinner at PF Changs last night it was a party of 15 we had only one server and the manager came around several times to speak with the table to see how thing's were going.  When I advise that perhaps there should be two servers to assist with a large party since some people at one end of the table was able to put their orders in and then the people at the other end of the table orders got put in but drinks  did not come out in a timely fashion. Also we got there shortly after 8pm our food did not come out until sometime around 10 or after 10 our food actually was cold when it did come out. Since we all was at this point extremely hungry no one except maybe one person sent their entree back it was never any compensation offerex by the manager  nor did the server ever ask how was our meal.  The manager  assisted once with replenishing some waters but not with getting the plates out to the table in a timely fashion nor did he help them at the end. Our empty plates and drinks remained on the table the entire time. The manager never sent this poor server Charlie  any help not even  at the end to present the checks. Wedid ended up leaving somewhere around1130 after the restaurant had closed. Based on this experience I would not recommend large parties to dine at PF Chang's  restaurant."}
{"text":"Waited forever for them to figure out we couldn't have our little dog outside because it was too hot to leave him in the car.   Manager was useless and said Service dogs only...    won't stop here again!"}
{"text":"PF Changs is always a good fall back for me. They menu is pretty typical- standard chinese food fare, really no surprises. To be perfectly honest- the service has always been pretty slow, so I stand by ordering take-out. This is FAST, and the only way I go PFC. I ALWAYS order the Ma Po Tofu. I am not a vegetarian- I could never swing that way, however this is my all time favorite dish from this established chain! The tofu is silky and melts in your mouth. It's dressed with a slightly spicy sauce that sings with garlic! Served aside a mountain of broccoli- I am sure that I am doing good things for my body when I eat..... lets be honest, devour this dish! Even if you aren't a tofu fan, I encourage you to give this dish a try, it changed my mind!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was very helpful. Food was good, nothing special but satisfying. Everyone loved the mini desserts."}
{"text":"Chang's is certainly never my first choice when looking to eat out. I just didn't grow up thinking Americanized \"Chinese\" food was something of a fancy dining experience. But to their credit, they do make a good and fancy meal.

The item I remember best of all is the chicken lettuce wraps. And they're just as good as I remember from years back. They seem to like dabbling in all Asian foods to some degree and the alcohol menu has no lack of Japanese beers and spirits. They'll make you an old fashioned with Suntory whiskey that I really liked or they'll serve you the Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale.

The menu is extensive but still holds quite the Chinese lean. They bring big plates of shareable food, to-go containers look like those folder paper boxes and fortune cookies are a given. The fortunes even carry a bit of P.F. Chang's history on the back instead of learn Chinese. Prices are a bit steep but service is also worth it. They seriously get hit hard here on Saturday nights so make sure you get reservations or just stay away."}
{"text":"Usually not a chain person but received several gift cards and have been using them the last couple of weeks. Go to PF Changs at Happy Hour- you will not leave disappointed! Cocktails and wine $6, beer $4 and food $5-6. Ordered the cauliflower tempura, spicy tuna roll and Moscow nuke. They use all fresh ingredients for all of their cocktails; even have a house made ginger beer. This cocktail couldn't be more refreshing!!! Cauliflower is not a healthy treat but so delicious- covered with a similar topping to sesame chicken and a little spicy but not overbearing. Spicy tuna roll tasted so fresh!! Not typical for AZ. Lots of great options."}
{"text":"It's PF Changs. Not superb, but consistently good. I did do an online order about a week ago for pick up and it tool over an hour to get. They promised a pick up time and promptly ignored it and made me wait an additional 30 min. Looks like they are to big or disorganized to address it."}
{"text":"What?? I've never reviewed this one?  I thought I was going to update my existing review to downgrade it and discovered that, instead, I'm going to write a review for the first time.  Sigh... I lament that I used to love P.F. Chang's as an Asian-fusion quality chain.  Hmmfph. 

It used to be quite good.  Now, I ordered Orange chicken; my husband ordered Kung Pao.  The presentations were no better than recent frozen Asian entrees I got from Giant Eagle (no slight meant to Giant Eagle).  Neither was the taste.  Perfectly cubed chicken squares covered in their appropriate sauce.  Makes me feel as if they have one huge tray of chicken and then just dump the ordered sauce over whatever was ordered.  Not high-end enough for the prices.  Sorry.  Won't be coming back.  Way too many options in the city for this nonsense."}
{"text":"Eddie our bartender left iris for 20 minutes with empty glasses waiting for a drink. He kept walking past but never looked at us or asked if we wanted another drink or food . We decided to leave and put down money for drinks. Then Eddie finally showed and asked how it was going and we said we were leaving x paid for drinks and left. We had planned to have entrees and more drinks but didn't because service was so slow and bartender was rude. It was a bad experience
We do like the food but service was so poor that I don't know if we will return"}
{"text":"I was sent a $20 gift card for PF Chang's from Klout. I decided to take my wife there today for lunch. Knowing that it would be busy I predicted a wait. They quoted 25-30 min's however it was only about 10. That was great. Over all the food was decent, However the 1 star is simply for the poor service. I could have gotten the same quality food from many places and gotten service that was far better. The waitress had to be flagged down every time we needed more tea, She seemed to be trying to rush us through the meal. At one point she even took the plate I was eating my appetizer off of. When I ask for a side of salad dressing it took forever to get this. When the time came for the bill it was dropped on the table, But no fortune cookies where there or even offered. Simply put the service was beyond bad. I don't think I will ever go back."}
{"text":"you know, sometimes you look at your better 2/3rds and make a bad decision...like choosing a chain restaurant that every time you go to you say \"never again\". Well, this was just that. We sat at the bar (as we do everywhere we go) we were slowly greeted, drinks came slooooowly and then bartender left. Well, we were there for lunch...geez, can we get a menu?? So we do and get potstickers, sauce/grease/tasteless oil was terrible, didn't like one bit, neither of us. Boyfriend git the crispy chicken lunch bowl thing, it was just chicken and rice. It was decent'ish. I got the lettuce wraps, I actually remember them being much better, though these were still good and a HUGE portion, I think their sister store, Pei Wei makes em' better. Well...Pei Wei from now on I guess :)"}
{"text":"This is more of a general review of the chain itself, having eaten at two separate P.F. Chang's chain restaurants. 

I think the food is so average that the prices are bizarre. Actually, some of it is below average, because it is so darn salty. I was with four other people, and we all ate the beef and broccoli, and it was so salty that we had to complain even though we didn't want to. The waitress insisted that that's how they normally make it and that we would have to inform them next time if we want it less salty. So, the waitress gave a newly cooked and less salty plate of beef and broccoli. You could barely taste the flavoring of all the dishes. I have had the kung pao shrimp twice, and it lacked any kind of spiciness. Not even a hint. The kung pao shrimp was also salty, as well as the sweet and sour soup. We did the dinner for two and for the amount of meat they give, the amount of rice is lacking. 

I guess the pricey has to do with the high end appearance and up keep of the restaurant itself. It is nice and the servers are nice, but I definitely would not go there again. It's overrated and expensive."}
{"text":"it's a chain, you get what you pay for.  Certainly not bad food for the price.
Singapore street noodles are consistently the best item on the menu.
Service is hit and miss."}
{"text":"Mongolian beef & the Kung Pao Chicken are always fantastic here. Make sure you save room for the Banana Spring Rolls for dessert. Yum yum yum yum"}
{"text":"It was my first visit to PF Chang in Vegas. Ive been to plenty other locations in LA before. This location, especially for its location being somewhat nearby the strip, needs to improve its service.

Our party ordered at least a minimum of 6 different items and our server stood there listening WITHOUT writing down our order. Now I would have been amazed if she actually memorized them but no, she stood there and repeated our order at least 5 times forgetting at least one item each time she repeated our order. And then in between the meal, our server was nowhere to be seen except out in the patio. Really? Please organize your sections and servers because this was one frustrating meal although the food was great."}
{"text":"All we can say THANK YOU LEE, the company should treasure people like you. You are an asset . The food is great , you can't go wrong , but the service is better. And the honesty is what went a long way , my husband dropped his credit card and lee came to find us to return it. Thank you. 
I believe in feng shui and first impressions are what last and it seems as though theres a disconnect in the front."}
{"text":"food was way too salty for pf changs. stopped in for lunch and it took a long long time to get our food. they also forgot soup."}
{"text":"The manager Sierra is fantastic. It doesn't get any better the Jorge/George my waiter.  I haven't been to a PF Chang's in years. I was looking forward to see what's new on the menu.  Plenty of really good looking entrées.  I ordered a great dish that was just a tad underwhelming to me.  My fault, I ordered a dish I really wasn't craving. After I received the entrée,  I asked George if could \"reboot\" and order the PF Change Chicken
\"Sure, no problem\" Within a few minutes, the manager Sierra stopped by to let me know it was no big deal to change my initial order.  She was asking \"rightly so\" the reason for changing my order.  I assured her the initial entrée was fine, I just wasn't \"feeling it\"
She was very understanding and cool about the whole situation.  George brought me The PF Chicken within 5-10 mins. Awesome!!

Thank you Sierra and George.  I will be back to PF Chang's Planet Hollywood on my next visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped in late to order take out. Sat at the bar and had a drink while the food was prepared. We weren't even half way through our drink  by the time our food was finished! That was fast! Food was tasty even after a 30 minute+ car ride home.

Bathroom was clean. I would return."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, the hostesses were no where to be found for about 10 minutes, then when they came up they sat someone from the end of the line, even though about 4 separate parties told them that the rude couple was last. After sitting down and asking for chop sticks, they never showed up.. 

The food itself was average to bland. 

It took another 10 to get our check after we asked for it.. Overall a waste of time and we will not return."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, perfectly reasonable. Location is convenient, especially if you're catching a flick nearby. The food here is about what you'd expect: Not stellar, but not horrible either. It's on the pricey side, but you probably know that already. It takes money to keep the engine running.

What is really bad is the service. Well, that's not entirely true. The service is actually friendly - very much so, in fact. They greet you, and seat you fairly promptly (at the appropriate times), keep your beverages filled, clear plates, just about everything.

But the wait for the food is absolutely ridiculous. Not one of those \"where is the food\" moments, but about ten of them, back to back, and it's not just when they are busy - even when the place is empty, it takes forever to be served. It could be blamed on the freshness of the food, but we're talking even soup and fairly simple stir fry or chicken dishes, so this isn't rocket science.

Or perhaps it is and all those other Chinese places just do it better."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this place in years but went for a visit due to a gift card. It was a fairly slow evening and service was right on point! 
The fish options were really exciting. The fish was tasty and fresh. If I go back I will ask them to leave off the sauces as they were too much sugar for my low carb diet! With the quality of the fish, they really didn't need to drown the food like you would expect at A fast food joint."}
{"text":"The Kung-Pao Chicken Was Not Bad, and The Chicken Fried Rice Was Not Bad As Well, the soup we ordered had to be returned though because it lacked flavor completely even after a bunch of salt and chilli was added. Overall I would not recommend coming here, I Don't believe I will be back. We also orderd Kung-Pao with no peanuts and it came with peanuts."}
{"text":"Yes I know going to a chain restaurant isn't that original, but some nights call for simplicity.

I was pleased with everything, and my service was great. I had 2 Tsing Taos, a fried calamari appetizer, and the spicy chicken dish which was crispy and full of flavor."}
{"text":"To be honest, I have absolutely no idea what the previous reviewers are talking about. This restaurant is an absolute favorite of mine. My wife and I often go there to celebrate something special.
Why I love this place?
1) Great ambience - dim lighting - perfect for a romantic dinner!
2) The booths are too cozy!
3) Great selection of cocktails
4) AMAZING food! I've yet to have something here that I did not like. Try the chicken lettuce wraps for appetizers. 2 people can easily share 1 serving.
5) It's a pretty big place, so you almost never have to wait!

Caution: Don't go there expecting authentic \"chinese food\" - u will be disappointed. I'd say it's Chinese-Indian fusion variety. It's along the lines of how they serve chinese food in India."}
{"text":"Came here for a early sunday lunch. They weren't busy which was good. We got sat right away. Our server was very friendly and pretty funny. 

We started off with the shrimp dumplings. They were so good. We got the order of 4 but should of gotten the order of 6! I got the noodles with prawns. It was so good and spicy. The prawns were large and cooked perfectly. My husband got the black pepper chicken and liked it but wished it wasn't so saucy. He ordered brown rice with it. 

Overall, the experience was really good. Easy parking and prices are decent."}
{"text":"Come on guys... we LIKE your restaurant - but, when you blow it - you're champs?  GLUTEN FREE is an issue for many people these days regarding diet - so are allergies.  You have been good about this from time to time but there is NO MENU POLICY - store wide?  Today I spent a good but unnecessary dollar and your staff/mgmt/cooks were NOT WILLING to adjust the menu and it wasn't that busy - LAZY as far as I could see.   I'll wait till you have a new menu and an ad saying you care about the GLUTEN FREE movement?"}
{"text":"Andrew was an amazing server!! We will be back when he's working!! He knew everything our group would want.  Suggested another item as we all were sharing. Drinks were awesome."}
{"text":"Went for lunch Saturday. Me and wifey shared the salt and pepper shrimp, shrimp fried rice and lettuce wraps. Excellent food and service and we did finish it all. One of many trip to PF Chang and hopefully many more. They were hit and miss for a little while but have seems to pull it together."}
{"text":"The saddest lettuce wraps I have ever eaten. I honestly was surprised the food was so bad, because its a chain, doesn't the food come from the same factory? or distribution center? I ordered the lettuce wraps with chicken. You know them, we've all eaten them, and when properly prepared are absolutely delicious. I was so grateful that the bar had open seating before we went to the club, I wasn't braced for how bad that taste was going to be. It wasn't bad per say, it was flavorless, the absence of flavor vs a bad one. I have managed to avoid this PF Chang 2/3 times that I have visited Las Vegas, I will learn to trust my instincts a little better next time."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful, as usual, but what earned the 5 stars was the incredible service from Amber! We felt like we were at a fine dining establishment. She even sent out a dish on the house for us to try. We left feeling spoiled and wanting to come back ASAP."}
{"text":"I havent been here in years but the food never disappoints.  We had a party of 8 we had reservations we were seated quickly an drink orders taken . Our waiter was fantastic loved him:) First I ordered the Crispy green beans never ordered these I normally order the lettuce wraps for an appetizer but these crispy tempura green beans I could eat 2 orders lol They have the light tempura batter an the green bean is still crunchy mmm an served with a spicy  sauce delish. My entree the sweet an sour chicken just perfect. The chicken is tender its not overly battered an not smothered in sweet an sour sauce just delish.  I saw an entree Im goin back an order it was shrimp with walnuts an melon yum my friends mom ordered this an I trued it oh I have no words so good . They have half price apps mon-friday until 6pm great time to try the crispy green beans get 2 orders youll love them an you got your veggies in lol"}
{"text":"I've dined at this PF Changs location serval times but this time it was the worst. From the moment we walked in, the manager was standing next to the hostess at the hostess stand and told us it would just be a moment and then had us wait several minutes to just put our name in. Once we sat down, the table was dirty, there was food under the table, and the utensils were dirty. After we placed our food order, our server brought out plates and those were dirty too. When she brought out new plates two of them were still dirty. Then we get our egg drop soup (the only good thing) and the chicken lettuce wraps that basically consisted of just water chestnuts and little to no meat. We asked if the gave us the vegetarian lettuce wraps since we couldn't find any meat and the food runner said no chicken so we sent that bad dish back. Once we got our main dishes, Mongolian beef and Changs spicy chicken, the beef was completely burnt and tasted like charcoal and the chicken was overcooked and dry. We told our server the dishes were burnt and not as expected and that the quality was horrible and being busy was not an excuse for poor quality food. The manager was not very apologetic and seemed more disturbed than anything."}
{"text":"~3.5

I've been to this location quite a few times and have always had the same service and quality of food that I've come to expect. 

I came with a few friends for dinner last week. Our server was super nice and helpful with things on the menu. I had the PF Chang's Green Tea which was delicious, a bowl of hot and sour soup, and the spicy chicken entree with brown rice. Everything was great and we had a good experience."}
{"text":"I can't believe it was a beautiful Saturday night and they closed the outside patio at 6:30.  The weather is finally nice and they would not serve us outside.  The food was fine but not as good as it used to be.  No more Dan Dan noodles or personalized chili sauces."}
{"text":"Well..got a email today for a FREE ENTRE..
WOOHOO...ER..
NOT..
So this was for their new chicken pad Thai.
730 reservations..seated exactly on time..
That was the highlight of this visit.
10 empty tables in our section..waiter obviously had TOO MANY TABLES !
Poor guy tried hard..but ..
Waited 10 minutes for acknowledging our existence..
Then 10 more minutes for drinks..
After 40 minutes our food FINALLY arrived..
FAIL !!!
New pad Thai chicken --what a dissapointmen !
Extremely spicy..rubbery noodles..

Oh and no drink refills..it has been 1 hour now..still waiting for the food to be made correctly...
So 20 minutes passed and the food finally came out so we asked for it to go..
And then asked for the check..
Well when the check came they billed us for two orders of the pad thai so I ask for the manager.
Waited 10 more minutes and then BRIAN
Came out to see us..
And then he said so don't worry we're not going to charge you for the second one and then I asked him why what he charges for the second one when it is a refire of the first one I could not even eat...
I am so over this place and the complete lack of competence in the management stats in the ignorant answers that he gave us as excuses for why the evening went so badly..
Now I understand the bad reviews that I have read about this place so if you have a choice..
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE !!"}
{"text":"First let me say that yelp coaxed me to do this review. We visited the PF Chang restaurant at Green Valley Ranch for an early dinner. Our service was excellent. The waiter was prompt and had a great sense of humor. The food was tasty but the portion size was small. The price was high for the portions we received. We will not return as other options for this experience are readily available. We have a favorite in Samurai Japanese Steak House."}
{"text":"We did a takeout order on New Years Eve and it was such a disappointment. The food was sooo cold and they messed up the order :(... Also we tried those pumpkin dumplings and they were pretty gross... I love Pf Chang's but I was not impressed with them this time."}
{"text":"I agree with some of my other Yelpers, that I have a love/hate relationship with PF Changs. (On one hand, its a great, classy atmosphere, good for groups or even a date night. The food is good but the menu does change. So I struggle with chains at time, because the reason why I go to chains is because the food is dependable. Since it changes so much, sometimes I have something I love and then next time I go, its gone :(  You do need reservations by the way.) I do feel like the service is slow almost every time I come, servers forget to bring something I ask for, but that is most likely because it is so busy."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the ambience of PF changs. It is dimly lit with industrial aesthetic. They have a great menu with some really great options. Even though they will be pricier than your normal Chinese options there are some reasons why... #1 Farm to Wok section of the menu. They use Fresh ingredients and American beef. #2 many gluten free options that have dedicated preparation areas so there is no cross contamination #3 great appetizers. Many people will recommend the lettuce wraps to you but do yourself a favor and get the wings instead and ask them to come out extra extra crispy. They are the best things of my life right now cooked in Thai sweet chili sauce #4 desserts: they have lots of fantastic desserts #5 sushi is even on their menu. So there's some great variety there.  #6 you can make reservations. The only issue I had was that our waitress did not frequent our table often and she had given someone the wrong order. By the time she came back we were done eating."}
{"text":"Great food. Amazing service. I know that Vegas presents a great opportunity to try out new cuisines, however we had just arrived and hadn't quite done our research yet. We love P.F. Chang's and decided to eat here because we were starving. Wow. It went from a chain restaurant to a five star restaurant thanks to the wonderful service we received. Our waiter was extremely nice and attentive. I will return someday when I go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"I met some family for lunch and was excited to see that they offered bowls with rice or noodles.  Then I was bummed because the two I would have picked were spicy.  I just can't do spicy.  So I opted for the Honey Chicken Bowl with brown rice.  The chicken was a little crispy and they gave you a bit of sauce over the rice.  It had a good taste but there was some heat in that dish.  I have had their Honey Chicken here before and it's always been mild.  I'm not sure if maybe it was cooked in the same oil as a spicy dish made before the Honey Chicken but it carried spice.  The rice helped to take the bite off of the heat but I drank a lot of water trying to tame the burn in my mouth.  The others with me ordered spicy bowls and enjoyed them.  They looked amazing.  I was bummed that my non-spicy options were limited and even then I somehow got some heat.  So I will go back to my regular choices of places to eat Chinese food."}
{"text":"Nothing special. I finally went here with my wife since I keep hearing how great this place is. Overpriced, so-so food. Panda Express is better tasting and they give you a larger portion for less money. Even Pai Wei is better, and that's owned by P.F Chang's."}
{"text":"I don't usually come here but it was good. Service was quick and we got seated immediately. The waiter was mike and he was great, he gave us a lot of time to choose what we wanted and didn't make us feel like we were in a rush and I appreciate that.

I got the broccoli and beef, this dish had quality in it. The beef tasted like beef and not just some rubbery mixed in substituted meat, it was authentic food. The broccoli wasn't soft or soggy and had the perfect crisp to it. Not too salty at all with the right amount of sweetness. I like how they made the brown rice, it wasn't sticky at all and it was just good. Definitely will try their Mozheto (Mojito) next time.. I think i'm starting to love that drink.

The lighting was perfect, not to bright or dark. The food was worth it's weight in gold. Way better than your typical fast food chain. There was a lot I wanted to try so i'll definitely be back for more, whether it be in Las Vegas, L.A. or San Diego. It was great eating here."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I am not a fan of Chinese food, however my sister is so we decided to go in celebration of her graduation. They did the best they could to accommodate a party of 20 (Broke us up into two tables of ten). 

When we get there, we notice it is freezing cold. I don't know if that is a P.F. Chang's standard or it was just like this for kicks and giggles, but everyone in our party complained. One of the cups of waters had a floating particle, which was disgusting. We ordered the food and literally 3 or 4 parties that had been seated 20 minutes after us received their food first. It was tragic. 

The food was good for the people who like P.F. Chang's. As for me, the white rice was the only thing I ate and I enjoyed it. 

Moral of this review, this is probably a great place to go provided you bring a jacket and at maximum one other person."}
{"text":"I love PF Changs. Well, let me rephrase that: I love PF Changs vegetarian options. When I ate meat, I wasn't the biggest fan of their food. But they have some delectable Ma Po Tofu and vegetable side dishes that tickle my fancy.

However, while eating meat, I went there and was sorely disappointed. For vegetarians, however I highly recommend the joint! For meat-eaters, meh. There is much better pan Asian cuisine.

Our waitress was funny and very attentive. We came here on a date and she recommended some amazing cocktails. The Coconut Lemon Sour was amazing. Not cloyingly sweet and hit the spot. I rarely crave cocktails, but this one is definitely craveable.

Rarely does a restaurant make yummy tofu, but they do here. In fact, I never order it at restaurants because 98% of them have boring, flavorless tofu. That is probably why people hate it. At PF Changs, you won't."}
{"text":"Read any other one star review,  it's true. I have only been here because other people want to go. Every sauce is the same. Just varying degrees of high fructose corn syrup and modified corn starch. I usually stick to vegetable dishes to avoid the meats that seem boiled, overly soft and bland. No texture or flavor except sugar and salt. The vegetables taste precooked and reheated since they never have any crunch. They are soft too so there is no texture to the meal. The soups like the hot & sour are so thick and gelatinous that they are more like dipping sauces. Tasted like the same sauce thats on the food, but more like a thick jello version. There is no redeeming value here. I have asked them before to not make the sauce so sweet and they said it wasn't possible because they're all pre-made. So weird since it IS expensive, it would make the most sense to stir fry the meals fresh and their problem would be pretty much solved. But, I think they're in the business of making money, not food."}
{"text":"Why isn't there a 0 rating?!  We actually left after almost 10 minutes of someone not coming to get our drink order, and the restaurant was not very busy. We have gone here several times in the last year, and the service and food have been slow every time. We have almost been late to the theater down the street on more than one occasion, and that is even getting there 2.5 hours before the show starts."}
{"text":"I'm normally a fan of PF Changs but this experience was not good at all!  I wanted to take my mother since she had never been.  I always bring home food for her to try.  This was not what I hoped her first PF Changs experience would be! 

The beef with broccoli was over cooked, and when we asked about it we were told that's how it's ALWAYS made.  The Mongolian Beef was over cooked as well.  I had a cup of wonton soup...lets face it you can't really mess that up!

Overall the service was less than stellar,the waitress was a bit rude. When the manager came over to speak with us we were asked had we ever been to PF Changs? I asked why he wanted to know he said because we were asking about the food and explained to me how PF Changs is not a \"typical\" Chinese restaurant.  I explained to him I was a regular at my local location and have NEVER had beef cooked to the point it was basically beef jerky, nor had I ever been treated like that in a restaurant.  

I will continue to frequent the PF Changs in the PH hotel/casino, but will NOT go back to this location!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Seemed way more salty than visits to other locations. Service was okay. Typically busy because it's on the strip. Friday at 3pm. The only thing I enjoyed wass trying the new Ahi Crisp appetizer. Delicious!!!! I ordered Dan Dan Noodles and the noodles were so overcooked. The texture was not appetizing. Noodles were much different on other occasions."}
{"text":"This is the closest restaurant around the room I got from Airbnb.com. I ordered pork fried rice and root beer. The fried rice is much below my expectation. Usually, I can get fried rice much better than its in Taiwan."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Happy Hour with some friends..one of which was having a birthday.
Our waiter was awesome. He was on it from the start. I had a few glasses of Moscato for $5 and the chicken lettuce wraps for $6.
I also ordered some kind of tuna thingy on a crisp chip..I cant remember what it was called but it was really good. It had a seared ahi tuna on it. The table split it and everyone liked it.
I didnt try anyone else food but they all were really happy with it and said it tasted great.
They did bring out a free mini dessert for my friend in honor of her birthday. Which was really nice...
Our server boxed up my leftovers all nice and we were on our way.
I love PFChangs!"}
{"text":"Jonathan was a very good waiter. The food as always was delicious. If only they would bring down the prices."}
{"text":"The Wait was an hour when we were told it would be 15 minutes.  The cashew chicken was bad, over cooked with sauce the was flavorless.   The server was nice.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Always great food and service, you just can't rule this place out ever. Great drink and warm/cozy ambience, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Solid place here. We went on a busy night but the service was still adequate even if we had two different servers attend to us.

It's a chain that doesn't really disappoint. Run of the mill American-Chinese food here which is far much better than take-out but not as good as most authentic Asian restaurants.

The location here is great in the middle of the shopping center with higher end stores nearby and the movie theater."}
{"text":"We walked in on a Sunday evening around 11 pm, they close at midnight. As a former server, I know it can be frustrating to have such a late party arrive.  Our server was very friendly and did not seem a bit irritated. We was great at suggesting items, refilling our beverages without us having to ask, and was very prompt with his service. 

We ordered several items such as the poke bowl, sweet and sour soup (Our fav!), Orange Chicken, Beef Chow Mein, Dan Dan Noodles and some white rice. A few friends ordered some drinks as well. Everything tasted great!

We were very pleased with the service especially showing up so late in the evening. Prompt, fast, and very helpful!"}
{"text":"Was happy to be seated immediately until I saw where we were placed, upstairs next to the station where the waiters enter there orders..not happy and the hostess knew it and would not offer us another table even if there were many still open!  Decided to overlook the poor customer service and order dinner.  This went from bad to worse, when no one came to take our order or bring us water to start.  Did I say we were right next to the order station?  The\"floor manager\" kept walking past us without even acknowledging why we were just sitting there...duh!?  He has to be pretty ignorant, lazy and clueless!  We stood up and told him we were leaving and all he said was \"ok\".  Really?  If we did eat there shouldn't he be saying thank you\" ? Never going back, I don't like clueless managers!"}
{"text":"I thought being such a big beautiful restaurant the food would be equally as good. I was wrong. My wife and I had the changs chicken witch was not bad but it was not great either it was really really sweet. Sweeter then a sweet and sour chicken or general tsao chicken at a chang jiang. We also ordered  the kaleidoscope sushi roll. And every one of the fell apart. Again It was not bad but not worth the price either. I just can't see myself coming back with so many really good restarants in town."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's is always amazing. If I could just eat their spring rolls for the rest of my life, I'd be a happy camper. (Speaking of spring rolls, they now have them in grocery stores!! You can buy them in the frozen section!! Not nearly as good as the freshly made ones from the restaurant, but mmm....they are still delightful)

Their lettuce wraps are also amazing. So are the crispy green beans. And their desserts. Oh gosh. This place is just delicious. Now I'm craving it...

I feel like the best thing to do here is just share a bunch of appetizers. I've done that in groups or just on date night, and there is always more than enough. 

Pretty large restaurant, easy to find, convenient location. Lot's of parking. There is outdoor seating as well. Kinda dark inside, but that's just kinda the theme of this place; it's rather intimate. Not very loud, which is nice.

The service was mehh. Took awhile for the guy to take our food order. My dad ordered Jack on the rocks and got it neat, took an unusually long time to bring it out correctly. Always had to ask for drink refills, glasses were constantly empty. Never really prebussed the table either, lots of empty plates takes up a lot of space. 5 stars if service was better."}
{"text":"I'm not a super big fan of P.F. Chang's in general and would give 3.5 stars if I could, but I'll go with 4 this time. This location had some of the FRIENDLIEST, most helpful servers ever. We had a party of 22 and received NO attitude from the staff. We had a private room upstairs and were given the choice of 5 set menus OR ordering individually. (most restaurants wouldn't give the choice...it would be the set menu 4 sho for a group that large) They obviously wanted to keep us boozed up cuz they were amazing at the drink service. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the drinks were only $5.50 a piece....and were poured heavy. Nice! The food was AMPLE, with about 10 different plates to choose from. Even though the food was served \"family style\" they provided every section of the big-ass table with their own plate of each dish. For about 10 dishes it was approx $29 per person....not including drinks, tax & gratuity of course. (It ended up being $47 a person) We even had control of the music level....which was turned all the way down due to the crappiness of the music. (Maroon 5, Jennifer Lopez, Matchbox 20...typical Star 98.7 shiz) This place is great for a big party...or if you crave mediocre chinese food at 12am. (they're open until 1am on wknds)

(fyi, it's located in the \"Planet Hollywood Hotel\"....formerly the \"Aladin Hotel\")"}
{"text":"Really good for a Chinese restaurant chain. I consider it more of a gourmet style of Chinese food. The crab wontons are a great appetizer. Be careful of some of the dipping sauces if you can't tolerate hot foods. The one that tastes like horseradish will bring tears to you eyes! The kung pao chicken is tasty, and not too hot to eat. My favorite bite was the garlic noodles- smooth and garlicky, a must have!"}
{"text":"I always love eating at PF Chang's!  For starters:  It has the greatest BIG bowl of Wonton soup!  It's huge!  Be prepared to share this bowl, since it's quite big!  The crab wonton/ragoon's are really awesome too, it's definitely a must!  I've had a few different entree's here, that are off the hook too!  This place is cheaper than the quality of the food is, it's unbelievable!  If you want a reasonably priced meal that is over the top, give this place a try!  I can't talk more highly about this place!"}
{"text":"Yummy food , quick service  and our server was awesome. I love that they have a gluten free menu as well since I have celiac disease"}
{"text":"The one star is for the excellent service from our waiter....he made the whole dining experience acceptable.  We came in & the hostess led us into the restaurant to the stairs. There were empty tables, so I asked her why we had to eat upstairs. She said that they wanted to make the tables evenly distributed between the waiters/waitresses, that if we went upstairs she would make sure we had a table with a great view, so I said okay. The she proceeds to hand me the menus so we could go upstairs ourselves.  Waiting at the top was a young girl, the hostess for upstairs, I guess.  I smile at her & tell her we were told we would get a table with a great view. She looks at me, no expression on her face, says nothing & turns around & starts walking.  We follow her. We walk by the only table left with a view...and she leads us to the very back to a table with no view. I tell her again, we were promised a table with a view. i won't go into details, but that young girl's facial expression & attitude was the worse I have ever experienced.....and I go out to eat a lot. She was both rude & belligerent...not a good combination as hostess. She was obviously having a bad day or hates her job.  Neither speaks well for her or the restaurant manager for hiring her.  Our waiter on the other hand, 5+ stars. His positive attitude saved the day."}
{"text":"PF Chang's is average food with sodium levels to kill a horse. That being said I still eat here about once a month because it is the closest restaurant
within walking distance to my work. 

This is the 3rd time I have ordered online and every time the order is incorrect. Today for example, I ordered the double pan fried noodles with shrimp, ONLY SHRIMP, what I received was beef, chicken and shrimp. I walk to Chang's and back to work so walking all the way back to complain is a major inconvenience.

3rd time is the charm. I won't be back.
_________________________________________________________
Update to original review. I called and let the manager know what happened and he not only offered to make me a new dish immediately, but he had someone run it over to my work. That type of Customer Service is outstanding and they will continue to get my business, especially when I feel a salt craving coming on."}
{"text":"Service from Pedro was perfect. Food was excellent. I had the long life Noodles and prawns and the pork dumplings"}
{"text":"The staff worked with me regarding my son's food allergies. We had an awesome time eating dinner. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My husband , son , and I just went here the day before Valentine's day. We had made reservations because we knew it would be busy. When we got there we were greeted very friendly and asked how they can help us. I told the lady I have reservations and she said oh yes for 630 let me get you host to sit you. We were sat right way. Our waiter was very nice and asked what we would like to drink. We got a drinks in no time even with the place being packed. We ordered the 40.00 4 course meal which was 2 soups, 1 appetizer, 2 entrées, and a dessert. We had a eggs drop soup amazing, lettuce wraps, we shared lou maui and honey shrimp, and we had the banana rolls for dessert. We got our son a thing of the chicken fried rice off of the kids menu..he loved it. The waiter was very fast and quick. He would crack jokes though the night. Our lemonade glasses where never empty. We had a very nice dinner and left happy and full."}
{"text":"Nothing remarkable.  The food is good, as with any PF Changs, but the value is questionable.  Service is slow probably because of volume and location.  This is not a destination for locals, but if you are visiting from Ohio and staying near by you may enjoy this restaurant.  If you have a rental car there are other, better options nearby."}
{"text":"Great location on the strip at Planet Hollywood. Sometimes it's nice to get food somewhere you know what to expect.  The food was just as great as home, which is what I was hoping for. Went for happy hour and sat at the bar. Brandon suggested a delicious white wine to pair with my meal. Perfect pairing. Thank you Brandon! Happy hour M-TR 3pm to 6 pm is nice if you are looking to try a couple appetizers and have a couple drinks for a reasonable price. Would come back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Waited in line to see how long a wait would be for three people. A gentlemen waiting in the opposite line psychically grabbed me and pulled me back and said that he was in front of me. I told him that there was clearly two lines and that my party was larger than his party of two so either way I'd still be waiting much much longer than him. The hostess told me to head to the end of the line and wait once again even though I had all ready waited in the double line for 10-15 minutes.

Absolutely terrible customer services and something I wouldn't expect from PF Changs...a place I often visit at my home town which I won't visit anymore.

I'll never be back!"}
{"text":"Typical Chinese chain restaurant food.  Flavors are not particularly memorable.  I just remember alot of salty dishes.  I only come here because a friend insists on making it a destination while visiting Vegas.  One thing I do enjoy is the chicken lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"Don't know what all the hype is about P F Changs.  We went to the one on Happy Valley Road in Phoenix last Sunday.  
We ordered two entrees, a beef and a chicken, and also hot and sour soup.  Hot and sour it wasn't.  It was decent, but no hot and no sour.  We have a little restaurant in Albuquerque that completely out aces Changs.  The entrees were just so-so, about 7 strips of beef with greens, and a little flavor.  The chicken was about 1 5 small bits of white meat, no veggies or flavor.  They did give us brown rice as requested.  Entrees this small for 16.00 dollars?  I think not.  Won't give Changs another chance."}
{"text":"Good experience and good food, especially sea bass and lettuce wrap, yummy!! Not 5 star, cause they forgot my entree, so I had to remind them and had to wait for another 15 minutes..... but when it came it was delicious. Server didn't came to apologize, but manager did for her so over all it was good experience. Will Recommend to a friend and a family."}
{"text":"We ate there twice during our week in Vegas.  If you've eaten at PF Changs in other places, it's exactly the same.  If you've never been, do try it. Order some steamed dumplings; they are very good.  I always order the beef fried rice, so I can't recommend anything else."}
{"text":"I was on my own for dinner last night so I stopped in to P.F. Changs and sat at the bar.  The staff was friendly and the food was amazing!  The bartender was very nice and it was not very busy (wed night), so she was able to change the channel for me from an NBA game to a NCAA basketball game that I wanted to watch.  Steamed Shrimp Dumplings and Chicken with Black Bean Sauce....Top Notch!"}
{"text":"Most unfriendly wait staff, dirty tables and sofas, supposedly clean plates with rice stuck on it . It was only downhill. It was our last dinner in Vegas and we were so disappointed. It was our night of comfort eating but it wasn't to be. The waitress wasn't even interested in serving us. Avoid avoid avoid this place"}
{"text":"My husband and I thought we would be waiting hours for a seat, but we got seated quick. Our waiter Vinnie was quite helpful during out first time there. Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"This particular location has great views of the strip from the patio dining area... Best after dark when all lights are on.  Food was great as always.  We ordered calamari and Cantonese Style Lemon Chicken... Both yummy.  Happy Hour drink and appetizer specials between 3pm - 7pm."}
{"text":"This reminds me of a Glorified Panda Express.
You get a Super small rice portion with your meal.  Seriously...  Rice is dirt cheap.  Why do I only get 1/4 cup with my meal?
Sweet and sour chicken had gristle in it.  It was sub-par chicken, not very good at all.
The chicken lettuce wraps ok.  My wife loved them, but I thought they were just ok.  I had high hopes and aspirations for this place, but it let me down in a aspects.  I won't return unless they fix the problems or lower their prices."}
{"text":"This is the fourth Changs I've eat ate. It was pretty good. The food was kinda like it had been previously frozen. Had a strange texture. Some of the changs chicken pieces was stuck together and the breading on the sweet and sour chicken was mushy and falling off the chicken. Overall still pretty good. Would eat at this one again."}
{"text":"This locations ambiance is pretty amazing  especially with strip view. The wait time was not bad. Unfortunately Mongolian beef was way overlooked. We were very disappointed. This dish is usually amazing. The sweet and sour chicken was not crispy but soggy.  Again this dish is usually amazing but was terrible. The Thai pate was tasty. We enjoyed the lettuce wraps. Our favorite was dessert. The fried bananas were delicious. Kids loved the coconut pineapple icecream. Hopefully we get a different cook the next time we eat here."}
{"text":"This location is clean and food is always great!!! The hostess working last night was probably not the best person to have as your first impression. We greeted her upon arrival, asked how her day was, said thank you maybe 3 times and she never acknowledged us even once. Grabbed menus, walked to our table, dropped them menus and walked off. Reaaally rude first impression. Aside from that, our server was great and the food is top notch!!! Maybe she was just having a really bad day."}
{"text":"My husband took me here a few nights ago for a date night. Brandon (or Brendan?) was our waiter he was absolutely great! He didn't make us rush and we were able to have a really nice dinner. The panfried dumplings were to die for and my husband loved the sweet-and-sour pork. Our items were boxed for us with no hassle and the prices were very reasonable. We both had leftovers for two meals after that night. We will definitely be coming here again!!"}
{"text":"Kelsey was great!!! She listened to me when I was trying to determine heart healthy options and recommended my favorite dish at Changs to be Stock Velveted. She also told me that pretty much any dish could be made this way just by asking!!! The meal did not miss a thing!!! Great job Kelsey!!!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I have been here. It used to be a favorite but other places needed to be tried. I forgot how comfortable this place is
I forgot how fresh the food is. I was glad to come back
We got the calamari to share   Hot and nice portion 
Kids got fried rice,and chicken.   The lettuce wraps are still good
Same sauces on the food
The menu is still the same. Why change something that isn't broken"}
{"text":"PF Changs has always been a favorite when it comes to food. Consistently good.
But no matter how good you are, you must back it up with truly reliable and honest service to have people coming back.
   I for one look for honesty of employees at the most minute level. For example:
  I ordered a lunch via phone. This lunch included 2 cups of soup.  When I arrived the server proceeded to show me my order and in the process dropped one of the cups of soup (in a plastic bag, thankfully) on the floor.  Very apologetic she told me she would take it back and get me a new one.
   Upon arriving home I find that there is NO new soup but rather the same dropped soup wiped off and put in a clean plastic baggie.   
   Mind you.... I will eat this... nothing bad about the soup... just don't tell me you are giving me a new soup and wipe off the old one and put it in a new bag..... I'm not stupid and I don't like to be lied too.
Too much of this type of behavior goes on in this world to save a buck.  Don't lie to your customers.  Don't say anything at all...just fix it."}
{"text":"Late night dinner at 10pm. We waited several minutes to get seated and the manager had to seat us at our table as hostess was MIA.  We waited 5 minutes before acknowledged at the table to order by flagging down an employee. Our server Penny did a reset on the service!  She was from another area was asked to help us and did so with a smile even after a long day an hour before closing.  Penny got our order quickly and appetizers in minutes. The ice tea had lots of ice and was fresh. I had dumplings, won ton soup, and surf and turf. We also had the Northern spare ribs which is the hidden gem on the menu.  The food was great and hit the spot."}
{"text":"First time eating at PF Chang- thought the food was fine but I'd rather go to an authentic Chinese restaurant any day. It felt like a Chinese version of the Cheesecake factory.  

Anyway, it was a Saturday, late afternoon, and despite lots of empty tables we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and after that waited 30 min  for our food.  I don't know if they were just short staffed the day we went but I wasn't impressed with the service.

Some nice items on the menu include the lettuce wraps and the salt and pepper calamari, which comes with a separate dish of salt and pepper for dipping. The sesame chicken was also very good.  Other things were fine, just not memorable.  

I think this is an OK place to eat if you happen to be shopping at the Waterfront and don't mind spending a little time over lunch or dinner. If you want to get in and out in a hurry, don't come here."}
{"text":"We had the best waitress Ramona she is efficient very personable goes above and beyond for her customers. Please ask for her you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really like P.F. Chang's, but I really hate this location. 

Maybe it's my fault. I primarily do take out orders at this store. Look, I get that it's always busy here. But, why is it always a cluster-expletive at the hostess stand and waiting area? There are enough people behind that counter to land a space shuttle. How is my five minute interaction with the workers here always awful?

My latest unfortunate service experience: I placed my take out order Sunday for soup and egg rolls. And by Sunday, I mean it was 3:30pm. It wasn't during church rush-hour. The girl who took my order warned me that at the moment it was taking 25 minutes for to-go orders. Okay, that's fine. She also talked to me like she would rather play in traffic than be behind that counter. Here's the real problem: my order came out ten minutes later. No one even bothered to look at the bag. I never gave it a second thought because I was told it would be at least 25 minutes. I figured it was a call-in order and that's why no one did anything. So, 30 minutes after placing my order I finally walked up to ask about my food. I was handed the bag, which was the only bag there on the counter. I said, \"oh, it's the bag that's been sitting there for 20 minutes and no one called my name.\" The girl just kind of rolled her eyes and gave me attitude. Sigh.

Things to know: like I said, this place is always busy. Go ahead and expect a wait. Your best bet is to make a reservation. Although, the family next to me made their reservation a week ahead of time and still had to wait for their table to be ready. Also, check the bar area. You may be able to snag a spot there. 

My favorite thing here is the egg drop soup. I usually just order a large size of that and the lettuce wraps for my meal. I'm also a fan of the Sichuan-style asparagus.

I don't know what the secret is to having a solid experience here. The Phillips Place location seems to function more smoothly than this one. My advice is to just be patient."}
{"text":"I don't know what took me so long to write a review but here it is....What I can say about this place is that we love it!!!! My hubby and I come here every year on our wedding anniversary for lunch. (4 years total now). As soon as we land and check in to our hotel we come to P.F. Changs! The service is always pleasant and the place itself is wonderful. The decor is great and very clean. Here are some of our favorite dishes. Appetizers: The egg rolls are a must try. Very crispy and taste so good with the choices of sauces. We also enjoyed the pork dumpling and the chicken lettuce wraps. Oh let me not forget the northern style dry rub ribs which are absolutely delicious. Now for the main course. You must try the Mongolian Beef with pork fried rice. The beef is so tender you can't stop eating it. The drinks and beer are really good as well. I personally like the cosmopolitans. Trust me you won't be disappointed. They also have a happy hour where you can eat and drink for a great price. After you're done eating you can go right outside the doors into the Planet Hollywood Casino and have some fun. Overall this is one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"I had \"Chang's Spicy Chicken\" with brown rice and extra sauce to go on top of the rice.  It's Like General Tso's chicken...  It was delicious!!  Our waiter Rob was really nice and was Very attentive to our needs.  Request Rob when you dine here."}
{"text":"It was our 1 st visit here , I m not a fan of chain restaurants , but this place truly surprised me: food was great with just a right amount of spices , nice selection on drink menu and service was outstanding during busy weekend dinner hour. We ll return !"}
{"text":"Dock a star because i had called to make reservations and the guy had told me that its full and what BS!! So i told my friend Neil to call from our hotel room phone to make reservations and he was able to make a reservation... WTH!! 

After checking in our wait wasnt that long. We all wanted to get a booth but we got a table instead. The selection of food was delicious especially the cod. 

Sesame Chicken- It was ok.
Kung pao Chicken- Delicious.
Cod- Scrumptious, Melt in your mouth delicious!!
crab rangood- good
asian chicken salad- very delicious!!

Recommend making a reservations, it does get pack on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I like this location simply because the service is always good. We enjoy JAMIE because she makes you feel like you're talking to an old friend. Love the food here, great selection and if you're vegetarian, they have many choices. I love the vegetarian lettuce wraps. My husband always gets their Spicy Chicken or Mongolian Beef. I love their vegetable Lo Mein."}
{"text":"Why did we go to P.F. Chang's in LAS VEGAS, of all places? Let me explain.

1. It's the only place which has a respectable vegetarian selection. Las Vegas is shockingly ill-equipped to handle vegetarians! 
2. It's a good break from all the buffets and the mile long queues.
3. It has decent food at decent prices, and its right on the strip.

Enough said!"}
{"text":"Generic food. Nothing special about the food, other than we were kept full on Americanized Chinese/fusion food. 

Liked the crispy veggie spring rolls with the sweet sauce.

Main dish: sweet and sour chicken.

But it was good in technique, if not really original in flavors. Chicken was properly breaded and fried. I hate getting Chinese food takeout and the breading is falling off....not appealing. 

A pretty extensive menu, but with so much to eat in Vegas this simply would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"We stopped here before heading out of Vegas to Phoenix.  The waitress we had was great; her name was Gayla.  We got our usual; chicken lettuce wraps and lo mein. I got my lo mein with shrimp and my husband got his with chicken. The food was fabulous (as always) and the portions were so big! (Way bigger than what they give us in Phoenix). The wait time was a little longer than normal, but we weren't in a hurry."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food , environment. Prices are kinda high but worth it. Our waitress was super nice, and helped us with suggestions. Can't remember her name but she did an excellent job. Wait can be a-little long but worth it."}
{"text":"Dereck, the server was extremely friendly and pleasant. This place is a must try. Super friendly staff, hot guys and great food. What else can a lady ask for? :)"}
{"text":"I love PF Changs and this location represents the chain well! 

My group landed here after celebrating a friends birthday at Pinot's Pallete. After 3 bottles of wine, and 2 hours of drunk painting, we needed food! 

They took our party of 6 in despite the fact that they were closing in 15 minutes. I was fearing that the waiter would give us bad vibes and attitude for keeping him after closing time but to my surprise he was extremely pleasant. David knew the menu well and even went out of his way to find a drink that tasted similar to what we wanted to order since they did not carry a liquor we needed to make the shot.

Food at PF Changs is always the same despite the location so it's hard to write a review on the food but when good service is given it is important to acknowledge it. David was kind, efficient, personable and hardworking. He dealt with our wild group of 6 well and I appreciate him for the great experience."}
{"text":"Zero stars if I could! Just stopped by today and I thought I would be having lunch and had by far the worse experience! I was looking to order the Korean lunch bowl and noticed from the picture the egg comes out over easy. Im 36 weeks pregnant and I need all my food to be fully cooked. I asked the server if I could get my eggs fully cooked and his response was they couldn't modify the lunch bowls at all. I said let me talk to your manager, im sure they could accommodate a pregnant women! The Manager on duty who came out was name Kevin and he told me the same thing and came up with this lame reasoning as to why he couldn't accommodate me. Im looking into reaching out to corporate to share my experience. If you are pregnant, do not stop in Here! Please do yourself a favor to stop in somewhere else to eat!!"}
{"text":"Since moving to our new office space in Science Park, we ventured out here again. It still takes too long for the food to come out for a work lunch (though not as long as before). Though it seems like the new management is getting the house in order. I upgrade this to 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I have always received great service and food here. Clean, organized, and excellent presentation. If you enjoy trendy Chinese food, eat here. Call ahead to make a reservation, this location is often busy, which also makes parking a bit tough in the District's parking lot."}
{"text":"Delivers just what you expect from a franchise. Food, service, and atmosphere were spot on and they made a pretty good Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"When came in, we were told the wait will be 20-25 min. We waited over 45 minutes and half of the restaurant empty. hostess very rude, server not friendly. Staff just seems unhappy to be there. Not worth the wait or price , go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"They get super busy but the food is worth it!  The calamari is different but perfect.  The MuShu pork comes with the most perfectly thin pancakes to wrap with!"}
{"text":"As far as chain restaurants go, Chang's is pretty good. Of course, that's not saying a whole lot.

The one item on the menu really worthy of praise is the Oolong marinated Sea Bass. When prepared properly it's delicious, but even this dish can be hit or miss. The first few times I tried it the fish was perfectly seared, crispy on the outside and buttery soft in the center. The last time I ordered the Sea Bass, it tasted so different... almost like it was steamed instead of seared. Not crisp, just sort of mushy. 

The rest of the menu items I have tried have just been alright, not bad but not great. Lettuce wraps were a bit bland, spare ribs were rubbery, egg rolls were mediocre.

The servers mixing up their own style of sauce can be fun, the new mini desserts are a nice touch, there's a full bar. The Vietnamese crab salad is good, I think it is a seasonal irem.

Overall there are just so many better, authentic options in Vegas.  My advice, get out and explore."}
{"text":"Usual P.F.Chang experience. Good food- great vibe and today we had an awesome waiter Ryan. When I'm back in Vegas I'll stop through for good dependable food and great service."}
{"text":"I've not had anything bad or poor quality at Chang's. This visit and location included. 

This trip I decided to munch on the lettuce wraps, pork dumplings (steamed) and some new happy hour tacos. Fortunately one order of the tacos were wrong and I got them free. I had shrimp and mahe-mahe. While they were both of good quality, both were skimpy on size and flavor. In fact, they were quite plain. I would avoid these fill you belly with something good and flavorful. 

The dumplings and wraps were as good as ever. 

We had the \"great wall of . . .\" chocolate cake. It's a multi-layered piece of dense chocolate cake, chocolate frosting, and chocolate chips (which I could do without). It's served with delicious raspberry sauce and berries (blue, ras, and straw). Delicious. Make sure to share."}
{"text":"Our meal at this location was excellent. 

Steamed dumplings, lettuce wraps, veggies and spicy chicken. All excellent!"}
{"text":"Straight to the point: Great place and staff (my buddy said drinks are good too), but food sucks big time. I tried PF Chang twice and let just say the chinese food here is just chinese food in name only. Most of the items came out were way salty and just plain not good. I realized that alot of people like PF Chang food and I respect that, but if you like authentic chinese food, this is not the place."}
{"text":"Been having disappointing service lately and getting neglected. Food is either WAY over salted to where it burns your mouth or way under seasoned so there's no flavor. Hopefully they'll be a little more consistent in the times to come."}
{"text":"Pretty good meal. Had the Tuna tartar appetizer. Delicious! Service was excellent too. Coconut curry was OK. Vegetarian meal, healthy, so I shouldn't too be disappointed if it was a little short on taste."}
{"text":"This is our closest PF Changs, which is over an hour away.  Still worth the drive everytime.  Great to have the vegetarian options readily available instead of having to ask questions or make a special order."}
{"text":"I like PF Chang's. I've eaten in a zillion of them all over the country. To a point, one is like any other one. This one stands out a tiny bit because of the weather here. It's fun to sit outside at 11 pm and down some lettuce chicken wraps and have a nice glass of wine. Plus you can 'shout out' to the folks outside Starbucks just a few feet away."}
{"text":"A whole group of us got the classic wok lunches. Food quality was good but all the flavours felt like everything was based on soy sauce. Being from Vancouver, I could be clouded by the chinese food there. Prices were average with the classic woks at $10.99 to $13.99 with entrees being around $18. Portion size for the lunches were pretty good and the service was decent. Too bad it wasn't better in overall quality.

Go for: quick seating

Don't go for: good food"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the chicken lettuce wraps, Chang's spicy chicken, & the tiramisu. Pleasant experience. Enjoyed the selection of my dinner buddy more."}
{"text":"Service was 5 star, price was fair, food was fairly disappointing. We ordered the pad Thai combo which is one of my favorite dishes but what was delivered lacked flavour, the soy beans tasted like that where either frozen or had been boiled and the crab wantons where soft."}
{"text":"The food here is so generic and whatever but i had a few gift cards to blow up and i did then my rectum blew up after i ate the food. In the words of wayne campbell...not so ZHANG! Again I am baffled by resteraunts that spend tons on decor and pay less attention to the quality of their food."}
{"text":"I love pf changs.... But don't expect the normal high level of customer service at this location.... Very slow and unimpressive service. You might want to order 2 or 3 drinks up front because you won't get a refill at all even if u ask for one.... But the food is great!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, P.F. Chang's can be found pretty much anywhere.  I like to stay at PH, so this is always a convenient place to get some fake Chinese food.

My only gripe is that I called in for a take-out order and eat in my room.  I phoned in and they said it'll be ready in 15-20 minutes.  I get there at the time they said and I paid.  I waited an extra 30 minutes.  Almost an hour to get my food.  What?

And the best part?  I tried ordering a soda and the cashier for the take-out.  He still wanted to charge me almost 4 bucks for a soda.  No complimentary soda after standing in front of you for almost 30 minutes after the time they said my food would be ready?  Whatever.

It's not like the take-out line was super busy either.

I like this place out of convenience.  I think they deliver to your room too?  But I don't want to mess around with the service fees/taxes/every other fee they tack on.  Stop being lazy and pick it up and eat while you're getting ready for a night out!  Unless you want to eat there too."}
{"text":"Walked in before noon time today by myself, the place was empty.  The hostess asked if I would like to sit at the bar or full service, I said full.  She put me right behind of the order machine (which I wasn't aware of at that time) where every waiter or waitress took their orders would go behind me to enter those orders.  Worst place to sit in the house!
My server was okay, he wasn't very helpful when I asked a few questions.  First I asked about what type of hot tea is good for sore throat (from cold), no specific answer was given, fine!  So I ordered a tropical green tea, not bad.
Then I started with a cup of wonton soup, but I tried to change my order for a bowl instead of cup after 10 seconds of my order, he said too late, the order has been entered (the machine just right behind of me, ding2x).  I felt like it was quite rude to say that..., sure there's a way to revise.  My vibe was going down south from that point.
After glancing at the menu, I decided shrimp candied walnut based on one of the yelp review.  Then he asked if I want a lunch portion that came with soup or salad, or dinner (he only gave me a dinner menu).  Well..., if I knew it did come with soup, I may not order the wonton soup in the first place, since I'm not a salad person.  I ended up with a dinner portion.  I wasn't impressed with the meal, it was a cold creamy dish.  The white rice was dried, tasted like overnight rice.  Had a few bites, decided to take it home.  Since the place was getting busy, all the entire of orders just came straight behind me!!  Very annoying!!!  The manager came by and asked if everything was okay, I didn't want to make a scene out of it, so I was politely said okay.  All of these happened, I still gave 18-20% tip, but I won't be back again..., thanks to the hostess, service & disappointed food."}
{"text":"The bartender asked me if I want choppy sticks and continue to talk to me like I was a baby which is why I won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I visited the PF Chang's in the South Park area recently, and it was just okay for me. Not horrible, and definitely not spectacular, but just okay. 

We sat at the bar and the best part of our experience here was the bubbly bartender and the lone businessman sitting next to us. We had good conversation with them. But hey, you are reading this for a food review. So here goes:

Hot N Sour soup = pretty good. I must now admit that I have some insight into the land of PF Chang's, considering I used to be an employee at a NY location. Let's all be serious here; it's a chain, the mcdonald's of chinese food. The kitchen just pumps the meals out, and you will notice that you can have anything on the menu sitting in front of you within 5 or 6 minutes, minus the chilean seabass. They are so busy, and spit the food out so fast, it just isn't the kind of place that you are going to get a quality meal. 

I do recommend the mongolian beef - the mongolian sauce is excellent. Just be prepared for your hands and feet to swell given the sodium levels in this thing - out of control. I also always get the ma po tofu - this was the dish that got me into tofu in the first place, considering I never used to be able to say the word 'tofu' without gagging. It's very tasty, a bit crispy, and in a spicy/garlicky sauce with steamed broccoli. A third and final recommendation is the lemon pepper shrimp - again, the sauce is what makes this dish. If you have room for dessert, do yourself a favor and order the banana spring rolls - it's a night ender, but so worth it!

I didn't find any yucky bugs in my meal, but I will say this: I've worked in plenty of restaurants, fancy and not, and I've seen them everywhere - it is inevitable that roaches will infiltrate. It's pretty unavoidable. That is disturbing though that it made it all the way onto your plate - a quality restaurant, a CLEAN restaurant, will take care of the problem right away before it gets that out of hand, and obviously PF Chang's is just not on that scale."}
{"text":"The only reason they deserve 1 star was because the soup and appetizers were good though incredibly overpriced. We ordered the dinner for 2 and the entrees were terrible. The Mongolian beef was so over done it was like shoe leather and the Singapore noodles were awful. The shrimp was so done and rubbery. The desert we got was the chocolate raspberry wontons and they were terrible. The other couple that was with us tried it and were appalled at the flavor also. So we basically had soup and an appetizer for $25. Was so not worth it at all."}
{"text":"As a big fan of PF CHANG, today's lunch was a BIG disappointment! Service was horrible and ordering one of their signature dishes-chicken lettuce wraps was another big disappointment! The lettuce wraps were so small u could not \"wrap the chicken\". Tried to alert the server but she was no where in sight. So off I went to the manager & when I stated my complaint she looked at me like I had 2 heads! I had to urge her to come to our table & see what I was talking about. I then asked her\"does this look like something u can wrap?\" Her answer was\"would u like bigger ones\"? I repeated my question AGAIN- which she then replied- no, they don't\"! Gotta say, not very \"manager like\"! I didn't get the \"good customer service\" feel! PF CHANG usually is a great \"go to\" restaurant where u can get a good quality meal. This location definitely needs some customer service training!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I do like their food. 

Last night I went with my wife and two guests. The apps came out fast and were fantastic. Dinner on the other hand, didn't come out quickly at all. The rice was undercooked, and we told our server. He set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order. By the time I was almost finished with my meal, another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice.
(is that the way rice is prepared now?)

I ordered the chocolate cake. I asked for a container to take half home. The server brought out a small container and when I asked for a larger one, she said we can just squeeze it in there, and started to flatten the cake. She then realized that a larger one would be better.

4 people, not crowded...2 hours total."}
{"text":"Go to Pei Wei and have the same food for less money. Dry rice, too-sweet sauces, dry & flavorless beef, oversalted everything. Don't pay for it. Pei Wei is just as awful for less."}
{"text":"Finally! I get tonYelp about something good. I was here a little over a year ago and had a good experience as well but with so many places to earnings the Phoenix area I just haven't made it back. So glad I did. 

Brought my mom and girlfriend here for lunch beige an afternoon matinee. They are doing work on the patio out front which could fool you to think its closed but its not, obviously, and it is supposed to be done in a week. 

To the food, appetizers of chicken lettuce wraps, pork dumplings, and pork egg rolls. The lettuce wraps were complimentary since it was their first visit. The wraps live up to their reputation and I found myself skipping the lettuce and just scooping heaping portions of chicken into my mouth with the serving spoon. Lol. Can't be wasting time with prep ya know. Dumplings were frickin awesome, again, pan seared, and cannot think of another restaurant that makes them as good. The seasoning and sauce with just a little heat was perfection. Egg rolls were good. They were caked in grease like so many other places and they weren't dry. 

Between the three if us we had the Kung Pao Chicken, Sesame Chicken, and. Broccoli Beef. Again, not a disappointment among them. I can eat. And I did. I was waiting for one of my luncheon companions to slap my hand or stab it with their fork but it didn't happen. I was perfectly content and ate just right without feeling miserably full, and then I looked at the dessert menu. You wouldn't expect to see things like Tiramasu, various cheesecake, and even Wontons made dessert style. Had to try the blueberry cheesecake and it was delicious. 

To top it all off the manager came over tongue table and have us all $10 gift cards since my mom and girlfriend hadn't been here before. Was totally relieved and impressed to finally be able to write a raving review."}
{"text":"The food is always great at PF. In Las Vegas stop by the Paradise PF Chang's n hopefully you will get Alex as your sever. She has a Great Tableside demeanor. Made our visit one of the best."}
{"text":"P. F Chang's China Bistro has grown on me over the years, and I just really like eating at P. F. Chang's.  Recently, I've been ordering the Dan Dan Noodles.  I like it spicy.  There are also a variety of options for my vegetarian wife and daughter, as in more than one.  In the past, we've ordered the lettuce wraps and dumplings among other items.  But the real reason I am gushing over P. F. Chang's and have a craving for the Dan Dan Noodles is because I just ran the P. F. Chang's Half Marathon.  I couldn't tell you why I crave food from the race sponsor.  Is it the coupons they gave out for naming ten things I liked about the restaurant?  The new app they were promoting that I downloaded?  That the race was a lot of fun and I passed the dragon?  I just really like eating at P. F. Chang's and the food tastes good?  The decor is fun?  No idea.  But I can tell you that I can't wait until our next visit."}
{"text":"I like my hot food hot and cold food cold. While I've eaten at PF changs maybe 50 times I always order the Asian Salmon- Fish is always great and hit but the brown rice is Luke warm-even tho I ask for hot rice 99% it's ignored and served luck warm at best"}
{"text":"Good customer service. All the staff is very nice. I love coming here when I'm in Henderson."}
{"text":"PF is one of my favorite Asian spots. The portions are large, quality consistent and service usually good. All of those things were true with this location, and the manager even stopped by as well. The only complaint is the tables weren't as clean as they should have been. We had to make a change even after a table had been prepared. 

We ordered pepper steak, wok-fired shrimp and filer mignon, wonton soup, and a side of green beans. All of it was very good. The pepper steak was a bit too spicy. Typically pepper steak isn't spicy at all. The peppers are just for added flavor. 

The service was spectacular. Our server brought me a second cocktail because I hinted I would want one at some point in the future. We also had the strawberry ginger margarita, which was excellent. But it's very sweet and won't suit everyone."}
{"text":"I don't get why so many raves for this chain.  It's decent but each dish is way over the top with garlic.  If you ask though they can cut it back for you on some dishes and the lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"Went here with my mom on Christmas Eve, and I really liked my experience here.  Resturant was clean and well decorated, and this was my first experience with PF Changs.  

We had made a reservation for the two of us, but showed up early.  I really liked how they validated our parking out at the garage for a whole 2.5 hours!  Yay!  I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, and egg drop soup.  Tasty!  

Service here was excellent.  I loved our server, who was friendly, marvelous, and educated on the menu.  

I would go here again in a heartbeat.  loved it!  I do think this place is a little overrated in some senses, as  some kind of local Phoenix hotspot, but for what its worth, I did enjoy my time here."}
{"text":"Bit fancy Asian food restaurant. Crowded at lunch time but waitress was quick in response and friendly. Singapore street noodles really taste like noodles with strong soy sauce flavour, but it's good as a whole. Not a large portion but prices are okay."}
{"text":"This place tho!!!.... ribs so good... fried pork rice good!!! drinks amazing but come on the service with KAT woowwwww food is good but service this is what we need in Vegas thank you KAT.. we will be back for sure and we will be with you 10 stars!!!! Good job and thank you Kat."}
{"text":"Went for dinner had reservation for 745 was seated by 8. Waiter was great very attentive. Sushi appetizer was pretty good. The steamed and fried pork dumplings where amazing. For the entrees the chicken lo me in was a bit sweet but very good. The spicy chicken was delicious but the pepper beef was by far the best. 1 star taken away because of the hostess. She was pretty rude"}
{"text":"I mean, it's PF Chang's. 

The crispy green beans are the only appe-teaser you should be ordering.
 
I always try something new for the main dish. Everything is pretty tasty. The only down fall is the size of their proportions."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Love their veggie lettuce wrap. We had ordered strawberry n cucumber Lemonade which was not so good. Tasted like cucumber infused water."}
{"text":"My favorite PF Changs. Always really good food and friendly service. Love the lettuce wraps and Hot and Sour Soup."}
{"text":"It had been about 15 years since I ate at P.F. Chang's prior to visiting this location on Saturday night. I ordered the lettuce wraps for an appetizer and the Mongolian Beef for the entree. Neither disappointed! The food quality, taste and presentation was excellent, as was the service!

The price was a little high but considering this is an upscale casual dining establishment, right in line with the competition.

The parking was plentiful and the location is right off the Superstition Springs exit off the 60 freeway, which is very convenient.

With a BJ's Brewhouse, On the Border, Oregano's and several other dining establishments nearby, this has turned into a nice little row of restaurants."}
{"text":"Our family visited P.F. Chang's for dinner and we had a wonderful dining experience.  The food and service was awesome.  Our server, Klayton was exceptionally friendly, charming and very professional.  Even though he had a large table, he paid great attention to our family and took great care of us.  We appreciate his service!"}
{"text":"A best kept secret! Chang's has an awesome happy hour. Nice bar, good drinks and excellent appetizers. Plenty of tv's at the bar if you wanna catch a game!"}
{"text":"when i first moved to vegas i worked across the street from this pf changs. everyone had told me about how great the food was so i was excited to try it. i think i tried the garlic noodles cuz thats what everyone raved about... and i didnt like it at all. 

i've been back twice since then and i can say that each visit gets better.. but i'm still not a huge fan. 

the other night i got together  with some good friends and we ate here since i had a giftcard. we started off with the vegetarian letttuce cups and i give those 4 stars. it has the same flavor as the chicken but they cut up the tofu so small you cant tell that it isn't meat. i might actually prefer this version since you don't get as full. 

i ordered chang's spicy chicken.. which honestly was like orange chicken from panda. lol. nothing wrong with that but the chicken wasn't crispy so it was a little disappointing. there was no spice at all.. 

my friend ordered the honey chicken and i tried a piece. it was really good. i knew i had ordered the wrong thing when i tried hers. lol she also wished that the chicken was crispy. the description says \"crispy\" but the sauce they use makes everything a little soggy. and FYI as leftovers my food was not good at all :(

we ended the night with the banana eggroll dessert. this was a piece of heaven!! the caramel vanilla sauce was perfectly sweet and the coconut pineapple ice cream paired up well with the deep fried banana. they dont skimp on the ice cream either! 

PS. dont bother ordering the asian pear mojito. it tasted like a regular mojito. 

will i be back? only if another giftcard found its way into my hands."}
{"text":"Got take out from PF Chang's on a tired Saturday night. Dan dan noodles were pretty delicious although the noodles were a little sticky and soggy which wasn't that bad. Honey chicken was also great although again a little soggy, however it was takeout which is understandable! The food tastes good but was somewhat like a little more of an upscale Panda Express."}
{"text":"Sometimes its not all about the food but more about the experience, right, no, yes?  Maybe its just me but I like getting a little business casual and heading over to PF Changs for a Japanese beer at the bar and a couple appetizers.    I sure can't do that at my local Chinese joint with the same higher end feel.

The lettuce wraps are a mess but delicious.  The dumplings, spring rolls, and crab rangoons are tasty.  If I stay for dinner I usually get the garlic noodles, side of their sichuan asparagus, and the moo goo gai pan.  These dishes are a staple in my PF Chang diet.  

Maybe its just me but I really enjoy coming to this restaurant, fighting the crowd, and just being one of those yuppies at the bar enjoying myself, not completely focused on what my food is going to taste like and what rating I would give it.  I guess its a good thing to have a lot of patience."}
{"text":"First time I have ever beem here and rhe first thing that stood out is how nicely it ia decorated. They really did a grate job keeping up with the Chinese theme. And would love that hanging lights at my place. Though the hearts on the stone horses butts was a bit odd.

The serves was good most of the time, but our server seemed to just disappear near the end of our time there. But no biggy.

Before I came here I was expecting a lot. I have heard a lot of good things. So, I was excited to go. When I seen the prices of the food, most dishes $15-25,  was thinking, wow thia place must be really good. After all, thats a lot for some Chinese food. However, When I got the food it was of less quality then most Chinese buffets I been to. The crispy honey chicken with honey chicken was soggy and my beef was burnt.

The quality of the food will most likely prevent me from going again unless someone else is willing to dish out for it.

All and all, the it was ok, but not worth the price for sure."}
{"text":"I visit this restaurant often and usually eat at the bar.  The food is always on point.  But, what makes it a stellar experience is the bartender, Robin.  She is the epitome of outstanding customer service.  Her friendly, fun demeanor is always welcomed after a rough day.  Thank you, Robin for giving 5 star service!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take around 4pm for a 7:30 delivery through a 3rd party company.  I called PF Changs at 8pm to see if it was them or driver. I spoke with Blaine who was amazing. I just wanted to know who's fault, he said driver hadn't arrived yet but he would recook everything and call the delivery company. He called me back 10 mins later following up and leeting me know he had called the company and food would be ready shortly. 15 mins later the food was at our door, hot and very good. I never asked them to remake anything or call, they could have easily said \"not our fault.\" Amazing service, great food!!"}
{"text":"The hostess didn't want to seat us in the desired booth because it was reserved than I asked to be seated inside the square where the bar is. I thought someone died if you see the face she made. Then I ordered a Vietnamese salad the salade either came from a sewage dressing or it was a cancelation kept in the fridge. !!!! We all smelled the fork and the spoon that came in the plate, it was like rotten fish smell. It's crazy to. E bold enough to give this food  
To my surprise the booth that we  wanted, never was occupied and as the time goes on more booths were available which I brought to the hostess attention  I asked her on my way out: was the booth reserved cancelled on you??"}
{"text":"They went above and beyond to accommodate my to go order! We are from out of town but every time we are in Scottsdale, we eat at this P.F. Chang's! Kudos to the staff and management! Delicious as always!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience here. Thank you to our server Lee B. for making my and my parties time here great. Lee has a wonderful sense of humor and it great to his customers. The food was wonderful and hit the spot perfectly. I definitely recommend this place for both its service and it's food."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at this PF Changs. The waitress (Keva) was really nice and was very helpful and knowledgable about vegetarian options. Good was great as usual. I always suggest the lettuce wraps (vegetarian option is available)."}
{"text":"Happy Hour ROCKS - the food and drink menu's get better and better. The staff is awesome and location is right in the heart of Old Town! I could eat my weight in Dumplings or Lettuce Wraps any day of the week. It will absolutely get crowded on a weekend night or if something is going on near the mall. Head to the bar and grab a cold beer while you wait!"}
{"text":"Although PF Chang's is strictly corporate food; this restaurant is bright ray of sun-shine in an otherwise desolate section of the city. It has a nice bar with a decent beer selection and I've always found the service friendly and very accommodating. The restaurant is large enough to accommodate 6+ for a business lunch or dinner and the noise level is on the low side."}
{"text":"Came out here with my parents to have dinner.  I have to say that our meal was all around worth a 4 star rating, but the lousy attitude of the hostess and the man behind the desk who seemed to be in charge quickly lowered that rating.  

Our food was pretty good.  The lettuce wraps are usually my favorite part, and this time it was no different.  My mom's fried fish peices and veggies was also delicious.  However, my $19 Mahi Mahi was pretty much like eating air... there was seriously no taste at all, and it was tiny!  I found myself adding all the extra sauces on the table just to try to give it some dang flavoring.

If I was you, I would order lettuce wraps for an app and lettuce wraps for your meal.  If you have room, lettuce wraps for dessert, too.  Oh yeah, and to drink, lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"Used to be fav. They took chicken w/ black bean sauce off menu. May not come back. Shame on you Chang's. 1pm for lunch. Almost empty room and bar. Figures. Updated May 24th 2014. back to 4 stars because they will make the chicken with black bean sauce which isn't on the menu"}
{"text":"As always I get my favorite dishes. Mongolian Beef and Chicken lettuce wraps! Service was great. Friendly but a little forgetful. But it is all good. I am full and happy!"}
{"text":"Another chain. Not the biggest fan of chains as I say a million times.

PF's was the only place open, that had reasonably priced food.

It's not real chinese food, but a good attempt at trying to make it so.

I've eaten at a few PF\"s now, they are all the same, food taste the same, service is the same, and decor is always spectacular.

It's a reliable place to get consistent food for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance and service.  Restaurant was clean. I would definitely return soon.  Michelle did a great job!"}
{"text":"My brother insisted that P.F.Chang's has some goof stuffs so we decided to head over for Friday lunch. I've been to P.F.Chang's for the first time about 6 years ago so I did not remember anything about this place...

We walked in, and I have no Idea why, but we had to wait for 10 minutes or so. It was 12pm and they had a bit of lunch rush going, but still, 10 minutes? But that's wasn't a big deal. I liked the ambiance of this place though.

Now, our server wasn't too bad. He had good attitude and he was trying his best to do the whole \"suggestive selling\" thing... BUT I couldn't help but to see other servers who obviously weren't trained properly or didn't have any experience in f&b. At one point, I saw a server reaching across someone to serve, while the person quickly dodged her arm frowning unhappily... really?

and the wait for our food was excruciating. I was hungry to begin with when I walked in the restaurant but it took good 40 minutes for our food to hit the table... 40 minutes during lunch when there are not that many people in the restaurant? the food wasn't even that great. I got sesame chicken lunch bowl and although I liked the fact that it had a lot of vegetables, it was too salty. In fact, everything we ordered was a little bit too salty, from soup to our entrees. Maybe it's the kitchen at this location? But I'm not going back to this one if I were to go to P.F.Chang's again. 

Oh yeah, and a bit overpriced too, but that might be because of the restaurant's fancy looks."}
{"text":"The food was extremely underwelming. With some flavors being too overpowering whilst others very bland.  I had ordered the house made ginger beer, and when I was finished with it, the server came up and poured WATER into the same glass. So now I had ginger tasting water. Which wasn't too refreshing. 
Overall I don't think I would ever eat here again. But that's just me."}
{"text":"So good! Great wine list and super fun atmosphere. Obviously it's a chain but the food is good and consistent."}
{"text":"Three stars, but only because I can't give them two and a half.

My boss loves this place, and since he was paying, I wasn't going to argue.  The decor is nice, and is a big change from the kitschy overdone look of lots of \"Chinese\" restaurants.  

Let's break down the whole experience, in order.

Valet parking is offered (free), but the lot isn't all that big, so I don't see the point.  I'm not so lazy that I can't walk the 50 yards from my car to the door.

The hostess had a look on her face that seemed to say we were interrupting her day.  She was not even remotely cordial.  I didn't catch her name.  The table was clean.

Our waitress was the highlight of the whole experience.  She was friendly, \"got\" my boss's weird sense of humor, and never approached the table with questions while we were chewing, though she did interrupt a conversation twice to joke with us.

We ordered egg rolls to start.  When they came out, there was oil from the fryer literally pooled on the plate under them.  When we bit into them, they were still cold on the inside.  Ugh!  Cold, greasy eggrolls!  The waitress apologized, told the manager, and we were sent out another order.  These were still really greasy, but at least they were warmer inside, though still not really hot.  The manager didn't show up at the table, which in my opinion a manager should ALWAYS show up if there's a problem with the food.

The boss ordered Mongolian Beef, and I got Sichuan Scallops.  He said his entree was what he expected, but nothing to rave about.  My scallops were very tender, and just the right level of spicy.  The servings of rice with the entrees were inadequate.

The waitress was really on top of soda refills, and was very quick with the check.  She got a nice tip (25%) but we suggested they put their cooks through a retraining course.  

Typical of what I expect from large chain \"Chinese\"restaurants."}
{"text":"ok so - I do love PF Changs! Service is always good, the food is always good and the atmosphere particularly at this one, is very nice. Love the fried rice, the pot stickers and just about everything."}
{"text":"Worst $20 ever spent. Went in with my friend, we are both servers for over 8 years. Took over 5 min to get water and another 5 min to order. Once we received our food (my drink was empty) never got a refill or checked on for the 15 min that we ate. Finally waved the bartender down to get a box and the check and asked for a drink to go. Pd our tab and ask again for the drink to go.. 10min later the bartender finally came back and asked again for the drink. This is not the first time we have had a bad experience but it will forsure be the last. So disappointed"}
{"text":"It's a PF Changs... so obviously it wouldn't be anywhere near the top of my list when choosing a dining location in a city full of unique and ever-changing options. But for a quick happy hour snack at a restaurant conveniently located in our hotel? Yes, that's acceptable. 

I will say probably stay away from their specialty drinks. None of those went over too well in the group. But do go for the mini shot-glass desserts... and order one of each to pass around."}
{"text":"Thanks Mark for the exceptional service on the Fourth of July! You are awesome!! A great server! We cannot wait to come back! We love the Market side options!! Smaller but perfect size portions! Also ordered changs chicken!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I guess I'll start with the good. 
The service was excellent. The waiter was incredibly nice and we got a complimentary lettuce wrap appetizer since it had been a while since we had visited. The waiter was attentive and really nice. Even offered to get us a GF lettuce wrap for my boyfriend. 

The mediocre: the food. 
It was okay. I guess. You know what you're getting when you go to a PF Chang's and I must have forgotten it's just bland. My boyfriend said his fried rice was good. But how can you mess up fried rice? 

And, the bad. 
The floor was disgusting. It was covered in food. I watched someone clear a table and just push the food onto the floor. No one came by and swept it up. It wasn't just one part of the restaurant. There was food all over the entire floor and this is no exaggeration. It was really gross and off-putting. 

There are other restaurants to go to down on Mill that are much cleaner."}
{"text":"More of an American restaurant with Chinese dishes.  The Dan Dan Noodles (Mien) were truly \"ma ma-hoo-hoo\" (so-so in Mandarin) with some of the noodles still stick together from the packaging.  Not so good!  The flavors were not bad and the sliced cucumber is a nice addition.

Nice wait staff.  Pleasant dining room.  Cool Happy Hour.  So they get 3 stars for effort and ambience.  I'll keep trying the dishes and report more later.  For LV residents looking for Chinese food, go to Spring Mountain!"}
{"text":"My dining partner was the less-adventurous type, so I reluctantly agreed to meet here for dinner.  We had lettuce wrapped chicken (over salted), stir-fried spinach (careless presentation - bland & uninviting) and pork lo-mein (edible, but not memorable).  P.F.Chang is for the 'pedestrian' Chinese food diner.  Having lived and traveled in Asia for 30 years, it will be a while before I return to P.F.  Too many solid alternatives in the Spring Mountain area, like Asian BBQ & Noodle on Jones."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Did a to go order and everyone was friendly and made sure my order was correct. Had a ginger beer at the bar which is always great. Sea bass was cooked perfectly and Changs ribs are super good."}
{"text":"Quality of the food is mediocre.. I don't get why the paradise location is better when this is a chain restaurant. The restaurant menu and quality of the food should be the same. We got served super soggy calamari and the rest of the food  we ordered I literally puked after cause it was just disgusting. The  service was also bad.. everyone there seems like they were too good to wait on people or even  acknowledge a living person. Will never come back..and I hope PF Chang's corporate office shuts this location down."}
{"text":"I was there two days ago.   The service was so bad.  The guy name was De and it would bother him if I ask for something.  He brought two dishes and after half an hour he brought our third dish.  The service was very bad.  The food wasn't that great.  Too salty.    I would not recommend the PF Chang in lis vegas Blvd at all."}
{"text":"Lettuce wraps are a must.  They are the reason I go to PF Changs.  That and the banana spring roll dessert.  I normally get either the tuna, orange shrimp or honey chicken and all are always good.  Nothing extraordinary, but always quick, good and huge portions so you have something to take home.  The servers all seem knowledgeable and I really enjoy the booth seating and overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"food is so tasty and by far one of the best...place is set up is great...dont like the ph hotel so that the reason for the 4 star instead of 5...but that is the only reason i go to ph hotel is for here..must try"}
{"text":"I went to PF Changs after living in Northlake for over 2 years, what a great experience if you like Japanese food.  It was freezing outside, so it was very busy in the restaurant - there was a 30 minute wait, so we went to the bar to get wine.  We were seated 15 minutes later and our sever was nothing but friendly and accommodating, it took a while for us to get our food, but as I said - it was busy.  He had forgot to bring us our appetizer and our dinner had arrived, he not only took it off the bill but still gave us the app to eat. Great experience.  I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going here for dinner. The food taste pretty decent, and the staff is friendly but often slow. Huge difference between PF Changs and Prince Wei in terms of food quality and flavor. Definitely recommend going to PF Changs if you're looking for an Americanized Chinese experience. Very tasty!  The Mongolian beef is awesome!"}
{"text":"PF Changs food is always good and consistant.  The lower rating was for the over crowded resturant with an extremely long wait."}
{"text":"Not So Happily Ever After

Celebrated my sisters anniversary with friends Tuesday evening and the overall service was exceptional or so I thought. Wilson our server was very social and a lot of fun! 

Regrettably I woke up at 3AM with my BELLY in knots. I've been sick for nearly two days now and as a result my Vegetarian lettuce wraps I ordered had chicken in them (my leftovers confirmed this assumption by the way). I've been Pescatarian almost two years (personal lifestyle choice) and my body isn't taking the chicken very well. Thankfully I only had one I couldn't imagine if I consumed more with the amount of discomfort I'm feeling. 

Dietary restrictions are uber important and I'm not okay with this breakdown of service from P.F. Chang's kitchen staff!!"}
{"text":"Tonight we celebrated our granddaughter's birthday.  It was my first time to eat at this restaurant.  The food and service were great.  We had such a relaxing enjoyable evening, I will certainly go back again.  We highly recommend P F Chang."}
{"text":"The visit started slow as we sat for 20 minutes before our drink order was taken. We decided to wait it out and the food and service after the slow start was excellent. The manager was extremely apologetic. Great visit."}
{"text":"Conveniently located next to Planet Hollywood on the strip; waiter was friendly & service excellent. Lunch menu is reasonably priced & food was served quickly. Nice patio area."}
{"text":"Horrible service and terrible food.  Ever since item ordered had to be sent back...burnt dumpling, wrong drinks.  Awful!!!"}
{"text":"We had such an amazing experience at this location. First of all we saw it walk the strip and turned around to head in for Happy Hour to get some food and cocktails. It was 4:30pm on Wednesday and we were sat right when we walked in. Our server was Ozzy and I cannot say enough good things about him. First of all he is an outgoing and very friendly guy. He gave many recommendations for both food and drink and we took his advice and ordered: spicy tuna roll, chicken lettuce cups, Singapore noodles, organize agave margarita and Asian pear mojito. He was personable and made us feel like friends not customers and made sure we knew about the PF Changes rewards program, which if you haven't signed up for you should ask your server next time you are in. We did not like the Singapore noodle dish because it has a very strong curry flavor which we are not fans of. When Ozzy noticed we didn't like it he apologized and without even our asking he brought over the manager and they took it off our bill. What a surprising treat their customer service is! They made sure we were happy with everything else and offered to make another dish if we wanted. We ended up ordering another spicy tuna roll which was AMAZING, thus the reason we ordered 2 of them. The happy hour menu is a great deal. We had 2 rounds of drinks and all that food and our bill was only$60 for Vegas that is crazy. After spending $250+ last night with terrible service and mediocre food we were more than thrilled with our experience here! I highly recommend this PF Changs location and request Ozzy as your server."}
{"text":"It's been several years since we dined at P. F. Chang's.  What a nice meal!  We loved the Lettuce Wraps and the Crispy Honey Chicken and the Singapore Street Noodles.  Our server was Morgan and she did an excellent job.  The guys who brought out our appetizers and entrees were also very professional.  I'll be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I love PF Changs. So does my wife. Home of the chicken lettuce wrap. My wife and I always start with that. To complete our order we usually do chicken fried rice for her and brown rice for me. Followed by beef and broccoli then kung pao chicken. The kung pao chicken is one of my favorites.
We dined in our hotel room so the order was for pickup. Ordering over the phone was a breeze. The order was correct and ready at the time of pickup. No waiting. No hassle. We were back in our room enjoying PF Changs in no time. 
Pretty happy with the \"pick up\" service. The food was the same quality as if we dined there. Everything was also packaged in quality plastic containers that could be reheated in a microwave if needed. The only knock is they forgot to give us dinnerware like forks or spoons. It was no problem though because our hotel had plenty in the first floor dining area.
Overall, the quality of the food is what you would expect from a PF Changs. They have been Asian fusion before that was even a thing. One of my wife's and my favorite places to dine. Eat here or take out like we did. This place is a winner."}
{"text":"First, this is a big chain - not my favorite type of eatery.  For me, four stars is max for this type of establishment for the simple reason that no one has license to create anything truly unique...

However!  The Chilean Sea Bass Marinated in Oolong Tea is freakin' fantastic!  10+

Now - everyone was happy with their meals and let me tell you it was a ridiculously busy night, servers were threading their way through patrons waiting to be seated and our service was very good.

I've been to PFC Vegas and PFC NYC - our Homestead PFC definitely beats them both.  So many great little places to try in the 'Burgh, but I wouldn't resist going back to this particular PFC."}
{"text":"SInce my girlfriend is a huge fan of Chinese food, I have found myself eating at this place on more than a few occasions. 

PF Chang's is essentially a large chain of Chinese dine-in restaurants, but they try to set themselves apart from the competition with their somewhat upscale decor and diverse food choices. For the most part, they succeed. I believe they have 4 restaurants in the Vegas Valley, give or take, so there should be one not too terribly far from you regardless of where you are. 

If you're a fan of Chinese food but sick of the same old stuff everywhere you go, PF Chang's may be the breath of fresh air you need. From traditional choices right down to some unusual stuff you never would have dreamt possible, they cover all the bases. I don't think I have honestly ever came in here and not liked my food. Soup, appetizers, entrees, they have choices galore and i have never had a bad one.

The atmosphere is a little more luxurious than you are likely used to in a Chinese restaurant, but it still tends to get a bit loud during peak hours. Every time I have come in here, the staff have always been friendly and good about making recommendations. 

If I have one complaint, it is that the prices are a little higher than other Chinese dining options. However, it is definitely somewhat justified for the level of diversity you get here, compared to other dining experiences in the area.

In the end I have to strongly recommend PF Chang's, even if it does get a little hectic during peak hours and you have to pay a little more for quality food."}
{"text":"I have been a bit hard on PFC in the past, but last night we had a great dinner with family and great service - both in the bar and at our table.  Lettuce wraps remain a fave.  Tried something new - Orange Peel Shrimp and it was great - will definately have it again.  Love the crispy green beens!   My only complaint is that it is very noisy - hard to have a conversation and very dark - flashlight on iphone is essential to read the menu.  The dark/noisy thing seems to be a trend thing.  Wonder when some smart restaraunteer will go with bright and quiet alternative.  Be sure to save room for desert - they have some awesome choices - chocolate and other..."}
{"text":"Chang's has always been one of my favorites but lately it seems like their food is going down hill.

We ordered my regular,  Garlic Noodles and they were very salty. Main dish was the Chang's Spicy chicken.  The dish was extremely spicy hot, never had a bad serving of that before. 

Our server was mediocre,  nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Years ago, this place was my favorite restaurant.  My last visit reaffirmed why it is not. 

The service is incredibly slow. This was evident as soon as I walked through the door, as I made a reservation and did not get in for about 15 minutes. After ordering, I did not get my entrée for about 45 minutes (during which time, our waiter made himself scarce), and when I finally received my meal, I was less than thrilled to receive something I didn't order. 

This all goes to say: eat elsewhere if you're in Philip's Place."}
{"text":"We got take out from this location and were happy that they included all the extras (spicy sauce, vinegar sauce, soy sauce, chop sticks, etc.).  My Chow Fun was very zippy but my husband's lettuce wraps were less spicy than normal.  They have another location on the Strip (http://www.yelp.com/biz/Z2zdSzJ38bWXSH_YL8vljw) and one on Rampart (http://www.yelp.com/biz/T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw).

In general, P.F. Chang's often has a long wait, but I find it worth it for some of the best vegetarian fried dumplings in the world.  The spring rolls are not so great, so skip them, but sampling most anything else should prove tasty.  They offer a good selection of vegetarian dishes, filling salads, and several other entrees that would get dubbed \"California Chinese\".  They'll make you a dipping sauce at your table, as spicy as you want it, and the decor is fun.  Also, I love any place that has sake on the menu."}
{"text":"It's my second time ever dining at P.F. Chang's, and I must say I've been pretty resistant in the past.

We had a gift card that we had to use up, so we figure we're in the Summerlin area and we may as well grab lunch.  There was easily no wait on a weekend afternoon, although we were told all the outside tables were taken.

They had about 9 offerings of lunch bowls that are served daily until 4 pm that include your entree being served on a bed of rice, and a cup of either Egg Drop or Hot & Sour soup.

They bring to your table a bunch of dipping sauces, about six of them that include soy sauce, hot chili sauce, vinegar, hot yellow mustard, hot chili oil, and one other thing.

My choice: 
* Egg Drop Soup \"A classic starter\" - It was piping hot when it arrived and with a bit of heat added to it, it wasn't too bad.  I was starving and drank it all up.  It was a bit darker than what I expected it to be though.

* Buddha's Feast \"Veggies with five-spice tofu served steamed or stir-fried\" - I liked the fact that you can have brown or white rice, which is a nice perk you don't typically find at Chinese restaurants, but then again, this isn't your typical Chinese restaurant.  It's a generous portion for one, and I like their choice of veggies.  It had broccoli, asparagus, snap peas, mushrooms, carrots, and tofu all in my dish.  So, it's definitely a hearty dose of the good green veggies.  I definitely needed to add some heat to my dish and eventually added enough chili oil that my rice was swimming in it.

The Husband had: 
* Hot & Soup \"Either by the cup or bowl, this will warm your soul\" - I guess it was okay, and he did drink it up.  I don't ever order this, so I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like.

* Sesame Chicken \"Back by popular demand...love the ginger, chili paste and garlic\" - He asked the waiter if they could make it extra spicy, which he said of course too.  Except that when the order arrived, the Husband said it tasted like they didn't put any hot spices in there.  He wasn't particularly fond of the sauce of the dish, but beyond the chicken was onions, broccoli, and bell peppers with black sesame seeds tossed in there.

They were offering 'mini' desserts that arrived in shot classes, which was a sampling for about $2/each.  We went for two kinds:

* S'mores - The Husband thought this was too sweet for him, and it really was crushed graham crackers, a very sweet marshmallow creme, and chocolate sauce.

* Strawberry Cheesecake - The Husband enjoyed this more, and all it really consisted of was crushed graham crackers, strawberry preserves, and white cream.  

(They reminded me of something you could easily do at home, but I guess it satisfies your sweet tooth with having to purchase one of their bigger desserts.)

Overall, the food was decent, and the portions were pretty generous for the price.  It'd be different to go for dinner and do family style though.  We noticed mostly everyone had to go boxes with them, although I found it weird how the staff would hold the to go box against their stomach and shovel the food into it.  (Sure, it works, but it looks not so nice.)

Side note: They offer a chef's table that allows you to eat inside the kitchen as you can watch them cook.  Pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Great service tonight.  The server kept my water glass full (darn all that soy sauce!)

There was a delay in the kitchen which I was informed and the server and manager came to the table to apologize.

As usual, the chicken lettuce wraps were great.  I also loved the wonton soup.  Even though this is a chain, I'm not afraid to admit that this chain has some of the best wonton soup I've ever had.

The fried rice seemed to be not as flavorful as I remember and the pork in it was a bit dry and chewy.  I remember the pork in the rice to be in smaller bite sized strips but tonight they were huge 1 to 2 inch chunks just tossed to the side like an afterthought.  The Mongolian beef was flavorful but half the dish were green onions which were a bit overpowering the flavor of the dish.  The beef was chewy and thick, not like I remember.  I felt the need to chew and chew and chew ... which is why I rarely eat beef or steak when dining out."}
{"text":"Excellent service & excellent food! 

Our service with the Bartender this morning was very polite, professional, fun & very helpful. She was proactive & very friendly"}
{"text":"Great service, decent food. To me, it was Panda-quality in a finer-looking establishment."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for a few years now,  since I moved to the Westside.  The service has always been stellar.   They remember me when I go.   They have a lot of the same staff, which says a lot.   

But more recently,  my sister from Boston bought me a gift card and whomever she purchased it from, bypassed a few VERY important steps.   The manager ( I forgot her name - super sweet lady) called corporate and got it straightened out for me.   She went above and beyond and I'm very  grateful.   It's hard to find this level of service these days.   Thank you! You guys are the best!"}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good--but that isn't what I want to talk about--what i want to say is that Brittany, one of the servers, would be why I would want to go back. She was very friendly but professional and seemed genuinely concerned about our experience.  Brittany is a breath of fresh air. And Brittaney, if you read this post, yes, you are delightful! Lol!   Kudos to P.F. Chang's!"}
{"text":"Nice spot.

Can't really complain about this chain - great service and solid food.  Showed up here before closing for a some quick grub before knocking out at home.  Had the chicken lettuce wraps and hot'n'sour soup.  Admittedly, I was quite inebriated - the food was great.  

The best \"chinese\" food I've had in Charlotte thus far...

dmo out"}
{"text":"I enjoy visiting this location.
Actually, I was here just last week with a friend.

The sole reason I come here is for the szechuan asparagus.
So damn good! Spicy! I could eat numerous plates of this stuff.
Lettuce wraps are always a good choice too.

Orange peel chicken and General Chang's chicken are my main dishes of choice since I'm allergic to seafood.

I always get great service no matter which location I go to in Las Vegas or California."}
{"text":"Ordered curb side to go.  First of all, we were quoted 30 minutes over the phone and didn't receive our food until exactly 50 minutes after the order was placed. A busy Friday night? Hardly, try Wednesday at 5:30. The Mongolian Beef was super dry and over done, no sauce to be found. But the Sea bass, takes the cake. Burnt to a crisp. 

We used to love this place. We live in Vegas December-April since 2013. The first few years we couldn't get enough. The carry out was so efficient and the service/food dining in was superb. Lately, it's a complete 180. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Only giving them two stars because the lettuce wraps are always good and the server was nice. Can't remember his name but very friendly and attentive. Compliments stop here. 

Our entrees took almost 45 minutes! Mongolian Beef was super dry and the scallions were very wilted and tasted old. Ginger chicken was very watery and bland. Both were only look warm like they were sitting under the warmers. Rice was not hot either. Never saw a manager either and we were there almost 2 hours. Needless to say the lack of attention showed."}
{"text":"Manager made us feel like a VIP and offered us a free app because it was my boyfriends first time. Great food, large selection and portions. I would recommend making a reservation because it is always busy"}
{"text":"I like PF Chang restaurants.  This wasn't the best experience I've had there, though.  The food was very average; nothing to write home about.  The service was decent, only because it was a ghost town on a Saturday night.  ....very average, not like most experiences I've had with this chain."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was professional, courteous and prompt. There's an option provided for those whose party consist of two, offering  soup, appetizer, entree and desset for two at $40. We dined in the patio and the atmosphere was very laid back and comfortable. Our wait was less than 30 minutes (more likely because we opted to eat in the patio area), if you prefer to eat in under the coolness of air conditioning, your wait may be longer. Overall it's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"First time here and I'll say the food wasn't a big expectation like i rather eat panda express but then wanted in a fancy place lol server is really awesome i love her  she was attentive until the end .. wanted to ask her to take a pic but then she was no where to be found .."}
{"text":"5 stars primarily due to our individual server, John Auer. He was personable, friendly, expressed interest in us, and bantered with our kiddos.

Food way above average, he even asked if we wanted an extra appetizer that was made free of charge (spare ribs, yum) We split the duck and enjoyed the tenderness. Great strong drink gulped - mai tai

Love the ambiance & atomosphere. You'd think being next to ASU that if would be filled with a bunch of college kids. Not the case. Good mixture of families, groups, couples ,and even high schoolers out for prom"}
{"text":"Located in Planet Hollywood, very convenient to go to if you're staying in the hotel.  Gets really really crowded.. There was an hour and half wait, so we decided to order to-go and take it up to our room since that was only 10-15 minutes.. You can call ahead from your room too if you are staying at Planet Hollywood or their Towers.... 

Love their dan dan noodles, candied walnut shrimp, chicken noodle soup, hot and sour soup and their lettuce wrap... We order cashew chicken, lettuce wraps, dan dan noodles and hot and sour soup and it was a good portion... Prices are a little steep, especially for chinese food, but compared to other dining options in vegas, this is actually average, especially when you are able to do family style dining.."}
{"text":"Don't get takeaway
Terrible service
20 minutes late
No comfortable place to wait. They ask you to stand in a service bar in the midst of servers trying to get drinks.
I had to call the restaurant while in the restaurant to get someone to acknowledge my order AND my presence"}
{"text":"By far this PF Changs, was the worst. It's sad to say that  br ause I've been to about 5 others and this Arizona location one just wasn't up to par. The waiter was not very knowledgeable on the menu and when filling our water glasses he spilled it on the floor in front of our table and left it.
The food was also not good.  The portions in comparison to the California locations were relatively smaller. The new Chang's Lobster fried rice was bad. The seafood in it tasted spoiled. Rather than make a scene, I paid for my food and decided to just write a review."}
{"text":"While the food is great. Part of a party of \"16\", tables we reset aside to accommodate, restaurant was not busy, no wait. Server was extremely pleasant but it seemed as if she was put out when more \"slow comers\" were filing in. I get it, it's RUDE to be late, but still a tipping customer. The manager was not very professional in the least, it's all in the approach manager, Be careful."}
{"text":"Excellent food, delicious appetizers, amazing service, and a wonderful date atmosphere! Try the Korean BBQ Chicken Stir-fry!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for Happy Hour.  Northern ribs and a cold beer  to finish off a busy week."}
{"text":"Glorified panda express

With that generalization aside I was willing to give ol PF Changs another try when they served me a steamed shanghai shrimp dish that was devoid of flavor

Thinking less flavor meant a healthier meal I alas was given a shocking reminder of how this place sodium bombs their dishes when I read the nutritional info

 'tear"}
{"text":"There were 6 of us tonite for dinner. We had a 6:00 reservation and were seated promptly at 6:00.  The waiter came to out table within 5 minutes, took our drink orders, our appetizer orders and our dinner orders. We got our drinks and appetizers within a few minutes.
One and a half hours later, we still had not gotten our dinner!
In this period of time, the waiter never came to our table! We had to flag him down to refill our drinks.
I finally approached the hostess at the front door and told her our problem and she said she would send the manager over. Ten minutes later, another person in our party asked the hostess again if we could talk to the manager.
Finally the manager came over and we told her it had been an hour and a half and we still had no dinner.  She apologized and said it was out if her hands! What???? You are the manager, how could this problem be out of your hands?  We adked for the check for our drinks and appetizers because we were leaving.  She said she would not give us a check and again apologized. No offer of perhaps a dessert on the house even!  We left and went to another nearby restautant where we were seated and served within 20 minutes.
We have always enjoyed PF Changs in the past but because of this unpleasant episode we will never go there again!
The waiter and so called management are unqualified and do not handle problems correctly!
Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"One thing I really like about PF Changs is the service, which is usually consistent and friendly...however, not this time.

We arrived at 11:05am before the lunch crowd. I don't know if we had a GREEDY TABLE HOG of a waiter, but we saw him once and that was it! He must had been waiting on like 6-7 TABLES at once! Maybe he thought he was \"SUPER WAITER\"....

I know they weren't understaffed, I saw other Food Servers in the place, many were just waiting for a table in their station.

This dude had us waiting at least 10 minutes before taking our order, he was too busy taking every other table's order (so much for beating the lunch crowd!)....he never did a check-up after the food was dropped off, never refilled our beverages, NEVER cleared away the dirty plates, and we had to ask another passing Food Server for a to-go box and our check. RIDICULOUS!!!

The food was good, but the SERVICE SUCKED!!!"}
{"text":"On the outside this restaurant seems to be an ideal place to enjoy some great Asian food. However on one Friday night this wasn't the case. My family and I got a booth in a reasonable amount of time, considering it was Friday and we hadn't made reservations, but that was where our enjoyment ceased. We were seated at around 7:15pm and we got our food at 8:45 the kitchen was ill staffed and the servers were stretched thin. My food tasted as though it had been sitting under a heat lamp for at least 30 mins. and this was the only time I've ever had chicken that didn't taste like chicken. This is unexceptable, it reflects poorly on the restaurant and even more so on the servers, who need their tips to survive and those servers are the only people I felt bad for in that restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good in general, but the time it took to get the food was exceptionally long. The child in the booth next to us was crying because she was so hungry and it just took too long. I know thing happen sometimes... But after waiting 30-45 min we got a \"hey, thanks for your patience\" and that's about it."}
{"text":"We had a very hard morning and saw PF CHANGS nearby so stopped in - We did not expect to have as much fun as we did !! We had the crispy green bean appetizer which was amazing - the crunchy freshness of the beans under a light tempura coating was so surprising. The Kung Pao shrimp is something unique as each shrimp has an almost invisible crunchy outer shell which takes it to a whole other level.

A big thank you to Danielle for her excellent service - her smile took our morning stress away. We hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"Great place to go out with the family. There 8s such a great variety of food and there are a few ways to custom make it. We started with the famous lettuce wraps which don't dissapoint. For the main course 4 of us split the honey shrimp which were gigantic and the pad thai. Thanks to the rewards program we had a coupon for free pad thai! Also, thanks to he rewards program we ended with a great wall of chocolate cake for my birthday. The cake never fails as it is massive, chocolatey, and all around great! Nice staff too!"}
{"text":"I'll start out by saying that because of how great we were treated, this specific restaurant is now our favorite. We walked in on Valentine's Day, because our original restaurant plans didn't work out, and we were skeptical of getting a table seeing as what day it was. We ended up only waiting a couple of minutes, and we were able to get a table! It was towards the back not near anybody, in a booth, which was great! It was our first time ever stepping into one of these restaurants before, so we didn't know what to expect. It was shockingly quiet and elegant. We had a server, which I don't remember what his name was, but he was the best service we've ever received on our night out restaurant trips! He listened to our every need and he was constantly coming by at exactly the right times  to fill our drinks, get us a to go box, etc. The food we got was just amazing. We were skeptical because we don't really eat that type of food, but our meals definitely changed our minds. We ended our night here and it was a great ending. I definitely would go back here again, and this is our go to place every Valentine's Day."}

We come here mostly for the food and atmosphere. But the service really could be better, it's hit or miss. Some servers are great, anticipate your needs, check in every 5-10 minutes, and are nice. Others seem to not want to be there, come by only once in between the meal and the check, and/or are forgetful or slightly rude. 

But the food's great, love their new menu."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 10 and our waiter Lawrence was AMAZING!!!! I was never treated this way at any other restaurant. So let me start off by saying if you want superb service, Lawrence is your guy! 
Let's get down to the food. We ordered the lettuce wraps, fried green beans and cream cheese ragoons. Man! What better way to start a meal with those 3. Hands down delicious! Those will always be my all time favorites for a starter. 
For our main course, we ordered the Mongolian beef, crispy honey chicken, chicken Lo Mein and the honey walnut shrimp with melon. I have to say, my family picked the perfect dishes to share. We had 4 kids in our party that actually ate each of the different dishes and enjoyed it. Nothing on each plate was overdone as far as flavor. I found it interesting that they put melon in the honey walnut shrimp. I never ate it that way before but I have to say, the blend was not bad. The sweetness  was subtle and the bite all together had a nice flavor pairing to the palette. 
Dessert was the cherry on top. We shared the fried banana spring rolls with ice cream. What a magical dish! lol I was full but helped myself to a whole lot of that! I tried my sons cheesecake, man.... PF Changs knows what they're doing! That was probably the BEST cheesecake I ever had! I will definitely be back to this specific location because the service was over the top! My experience with the staff, even right when I first came in, was very pleasant. To the guys (I didn't get their names) who brought over our dishes and to the guy who boxed our leftovers were all very polite. I love coming to a restaurant where you can get really good food and the right treatment of service. Every restaurant should always be like this. Thank you to the management who hired all the amazing staff, you have a great team!!! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Time of day: friday 2pm. 
Service of waiter: tyler - he kept forgetting to bring our child's juice. He forgot what kind of rice we ordered... Twice! He charged us separately for the child's juice even tho the kids menu mentioned that each meal comes with a drink, and he was the one to suggest the pineapple juice... ( -.5*)
Food: really good! Cooked as expected and we had leftovers too, so big portions. We ordered from the \"for two\" menu, the wonton soup and egg drop. The egg drop soup needed more salt. The crab wontons. Good! No complains. The moo goo gai pan with brown rice. It was so big i ate only half. Really tasty tho! And the husband got the Mongolian beef with brown rice, and according to him it was just perfect. And for desert we had the chocolate raspberry wontons. Eh... I've had better. 
Our 14mo old had the kids lo mein and she ate the whole thing!! 
I wish i could give a 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"New Menu-A lot of my old favorites have been taken off the menu and replaced with different dishes that are not to my taste. 

New apps that are good are the spicy chicken soup, the sauce fie the chicken egg rolls is delish and the ole standby chicken lettuce wraps remain great. 

Crowded even on a Sunday night-parking lot-casual dress."}
{"text":"Hubby and I always enjoy this place. Typically after a few ours in the gym! Never had a bad dish. Ambience is perfect for a Saturday afternoon! Love the white tea! Not crazy about their desserts, but if love sweets, save it for the really good stuff!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and have been for years. I've watched this location go down hill for months but this past weekend it hit bottom and I won't be back. The food used to wonderful, bigger portions, awesome service consistently. The whole staff especially our server were so unhappy saturday. There wasn't a wait or a full restaurant which it used to be crazy on a Saturday night. The food was so greasy and took 35 min to come out. Our waitress told us everyone tells her it's changed when we mentioned it to her. She didn't seem to care at all either. $30 average a person for Chinese doesn't get you anything here now. So sad it used to be so good"}
{"text":"Props to our server Kyle and the female manager working today around 1230. My friend is allergic to shrimp and she told Kyle this. He said he would inform the kitchen. Cross contamination is obviously a concern of hers. We ordered 4 appetizers and 1 main dish, we planned on extras to take home to the hubbies. Our food was served by a runner. Almost as soon as our food was placed on the table the manager and Kyle were standing by us. The manager had a list in her hand which clearly stated allergies precautions. 3 of the 5 dishes contained oyster sauce or another sensitive ingredient. I offered to put the dishes on my side of the tab and just move on. They both offered other similar options that were safe for my friend. We couldn't be more surprised when we received the bill, 2 dishes were comped. That wasn't necessary but it sure was nice. I really appreciate great service but more importantly I find the urgency in taking food allergies seriously. There was a slip in the system but the staff were right on it. Good job, pat on the back for you."}
{"text":"Such a great experience!  The food was fantastic and the manager Dillion was super professional and gave us incredible service!"}
{"text":"This location was super busy vs the south park location , but the manager was able to help the host stand and get customers seated fast . I felt bad for our waitress bc she did everything.  I notice at south park the servers have help . She had wonderful customer service so I definitely commended her for keeping us happy while we waited so long even for a cup of soup . The food didn't taste as fresh and prepared as the PF Chang's in south park , we ordered our usual honey shrimp and Mongolian beef but the taste was off ? I don't think I'll go back to this location or I might not like PF Chang's anymore"}
{"text":"I love PF Chang's,  always delicious and they added new dishes to their menu. Great pan Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"I am a loyal customer to PF Changs- very disappointed with the service and quality of food I got at this location- I ordered their latest surf and turf which I'm used to getting with the half lobster tail (just like the picture on the menu) what I got was the dish with the clumps of lobster tail meat fried!!!!! WTH! I mentioned it to the waiter and he said that corporate made the decision to serve it like that! Also, the waitress had a horrible attitude- seemed like she was overwhelmed!
I will avoid this place, there are plenty of other eateries around the area."}
{"text":"I love love love their orange chicken. Maybe it's because it's the first place I tried it, but to this day, it is still my favorite. 
I wish the Scottsdale location had a better to-go system, but the food is good enough that I'm willing to deal with it."}
{"text":"To end the weekend, I decided to meet a friend I've never seen in a long time, for dinner. We agreed on PF Changs as we both love Asian foods. Years back, I worked for Lucille's restaurant around the corner. During those days, I would frequent PF's because it was convenience. Since working there, I haven't been to PF's so I was excited to wine and dine!

Located in the District, once you exit the 215, turn down south on Green Valley, make the immediate right and you'll see PF Chang's. As a stand alone building, you have the luxury of private parking, but be advised, it isn't big. On busy nights, you'll have to park in the main district parking. Approaching the restaurant, you'll notice an outdoor seating area, left of the front doors. Once you enter, the main focal point is a hand painted Asian mural, which looked super cool and depicted some form of historic event. The main bar is located underneath the mural and most of the dining area is to the right. As we were seated, I noticed the mural continued throughout the dining room. There were other Asian artwork and Chinese statues solidifying the type of restaurant. The larger ceiling lights weren't as bright as you would expect and coupled with the dim red lighting on the outskirts of the dining room, it made for a great date night spot. For dinner, our server was super nice. She was accommodating and ensured our orders were correct. That's one thing I was appreciative of. She kept asking questions and I definitely felt our needs were being met. Now that's good service!

For dinner, I wanted to start with an adult like drink. I chose to go with the 2012 Estancia Pinot Grigio for $8 a glass. I actually liked this brand. I felt the wine was super crisp, with a fruity taste with a tangy/zesty type finish. I would recommend this wine again! For dinner, I decided to go with one of their signature appetizers, the Chang's chicken lettuce wraps for $8.95. As described on the menu, wok-seared chicken, mushrooms, green onions and water chestnuts served over crispy rice sticks with lettuce cups. The chicken and mushrooms had the same texture so I'm super glad they chose the crunchy chestnut texture. The flavor was jam packed in the dish, kind of borderline salty. The rice sticks were good and crispy. I felt though, the oiliness of the sticks and the oil from the sauce was a little much. I was hoping for more of a health conscious dish, but there was a little too much oil to consider this dish healthy. I know, I know, I should have gone with a salad. I just wanted to try something else! 

At the end of the day, my meal was definitely OK. There's no reason for me NOT to return. I think PF Chang's offers a lot of great dishes. This one was just not the best I've had, but I know I'll be back to check something else out in the near future. Great spot to hang with some cool friends!"}
{"text":"Not sure if they are having staff issues today, but the service in the bar area was sllllloooww. As down at the bar and 10 minutes later...nothing. Lady came in after me and got tired of waiting and left."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to a PF Chang's. The service was a little on the dorky side. The server had a tendency to respond to any question with: \"When in Chang's...\" (a riff on \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\"). But we tried quite a few of the menu items and they were all pretty good. However, the prices were outrageous for what you get."}
{"text":"After a 4 hour drive home, we were so looking forward to a good meal. Having been in the restaurant industry for 15 years I like to believe I have a high tolerance and understanding but everything about the meal (aside from the spicy scallop sushi which was delicious) was a disappointment. 

Although they sat us quickly on a busy Saturday evening, our app was delivered without plates or silverware and it was several minutes before we were able to flag anyone down. 15 minutes later (after ordering), our beer showed up. I ended up ordering the \"hot fish\" aka Alaskan cod which turned out to be nothing but fried mush. Thankfully the carrots, bok choy and white rice were good or I wouldn't have eaten anything.

Although the manager did stop by and comp our second beer (requested while eating app, not delivered until after entree was finished) and offered something else, we had been done eating for some time and were ready to leave. $75 later... I would never return."}
{"text":"I never dined in but got take out when I worked in PH. 

This is not traditional Chinese, but it'll do when sometimes my other options didn't sound so great. 

Singapore Noodles, Dan Dan noodles, orange beef, honey chicken or shimp weren't bad and what I usually ordered.

I appreciate the brown or white rice option. Also their ice teas are surprisingly pretty good- like their blackberry jasmine green.

Now they have lunch specials- You have a few entree choices and you get hot& sour or egg drop soup.

Lunch specials are not badly priced and glad it was introduced after PF Changs stopped giving a discount to people who work in Miracle Mile/PH. Boo- they make so much money...really they can't? I normally am not a stickler about a discount but all other smaller chains and non chains offered a discount in PH but the largest chain can't to employees? Went from 25% to 20% to 15% to none in a matter of like a year. 

They effed up my order a few times and it sucks having to run back and waste my lunch break. I had to get in the habit of checking everything before leaving as once it wasn't even my order, another time I only had half of what I ordered for me and the girls at work, and another I ordered sides of veggies and it wasnt in there. 

For that, I can't really give them much due to their mistakes. It always ruined my lunch break since I end up having to get my food, take a few bites and I'm SOL and have to clock back in and eat lunch for dinner. That's fucked up that it happened 4 times before I got smart to look. And yes, they made a mistake twice after that and I got charged twice one day. 

2.5 stars for their mistakes and being discount stingy. 3.5 for the food as it usually was pretty big portions and tasty enough."}
{"text":"There's a reason why Asians don't go here.

1) Overpriced
2) Bland food
3) The food that's not bland isn't that good

This sums up my first and only experience at P.F. Changs in Scottsdale, or any other location for that matter.

Panda Express has better flavors, and is cheaper."}
{"text":"Way overpriced food, waiter gave me a hard time making me say the word faucet water to get my complementary water! Extremely rude and disrespectful. Very disappoint :("}
{"text":"The food has been better. I did takeout. The menu changes aren't necessarily better.  My Changs spare ribs were just northern style ribs with bbq sauce on them. So salty I ate one and threw them out.  The orange peel beef, always a go to for me now has orange segments. YUCK! The pork fried rice had clumps of white rice barley any stir fry sauce and zero flavor. For almost $40 we had a very disappointing dinner. I went to PFchangs.com and filled out a comment and never heard a response from them. Poor customer service. Oh how they've changed. It seems like mgt there is a little goofy these days as well. Something's up with Phillips place. The bartender Alexis was the best part of my experience. Having a drink while waiting for my food!"}
{"text":"disappointed, service was ok, not what it used to be, food wasn't that great either, the cook used way to much pepper on the rice. Chicken was very tough. So then some college kids end up sitting behind us, and was acting like they where in a bar. We had our kids with us and I came close to saying something, but the manager should have seen that and took care of it, he was at there table twice."}
{"text":"I heard about the happy hour specials and timed our visited in between 3-6PM and was glad there wasn't a wait either.  Yes, every time I visit PF Changs, I hope it's as good experience as my first few visits and then I usually leave a little disappointed. 

I ordered 3 items, and yes I know my eyes were bigger than my stomach but I wanted to try many items and they were on special.  I got the pork dumplings, 3 for $3.25, 6 crab wontons for $5, and lettuce wraps with chicken for $6.  I thought the dumplings were going to be like the ones at dim sum since they advertise it like that but it was they were more like potstickers steamed instead of fried.  The wontons were crispy and the filling was alright.  I did like the plum sauce that was served with the wontons.  There was a lot of chicken for the lettuce wraps.  I could barely finish 2, and was glad my husband was able to eat the rest of the chicken.

The service was good and the atmosphere is not bad, a little dark, but comfortable.  I would probably give it 3.5 if I could.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I will likely try another restaurant for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Stoped in for lunch on our way through town. Galyna was our server! She did an amazing job! She knew her menu and the restaurant well. She was very helpful and had a continuous smile! She also kept our drinks full which is a huge plus in my book! Thank you for the great service! If I every make my way back again I will be asking to sit in Galyna section!"}
{"text":"Absolutely will be going back. They said the wait would be about an hour but only waiting 30 minutes. Best customer service I have ever had at a restaurant. They said they were backed up in the kitchen, but the food came out a lot quicker than expected and the food was absolutely fantastic! The lettuce wraps are out of this world! Our waitress said it was her first night and it was almost as if she had been at the restaurant for years. Make sure to ask for Donna! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Super delicious my favorite Changs chicken soup.  It's understated on the menu but is super good for you.  Service is slow because they are jammed pack.  Needs background music to give more ambiance"}
{"text":"First off- do not order or eat the lettuce wraps.  A lady friend of mine that worked here explained how they come up with the filling for that dish and it's not appetizing.  Other than that it's OK, but their newer sister stores \"Pei Wei\" are better.  There are better places to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent from top to bottom.  If you've been to a PF Chang's before and I enjoy the franchise, this place will not disappoint.

For those that have never been to one, it's a high end Chinese restaurant and you'll pay a good 25% more than you would at your local favorite.

The dining room is very nice but we usually eat in the bar area, either at a table or at the bar itself.  You just seem to get better and quicker service in here.

Our Favorites:

Mongolian Beef (a must!)
Lettuce Wraps of course
Dry Rubbed Ribs
Won Ton Soup

Relax and enjoy."}
{"text":"I love this chain but you will most likely be disappointed with this particular restaurant.  Located at the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino, and along the strip, it's easy enough to locate if you're in the mood.

But with so many great restaurants all nearby, I'd skip this place.

My main problem with this restaurant is it's poorly managed.  The food is as good as any PFChangs but the people don't seem to care and the manager doesn't follow instructions very well at all.

A group of 40, we had done countless emails back and forth with directions on what we wanted and what time we'd be there.  Of course when we arrived, they weren't ready for us and on top of that, the menu was wrong.

Tighten the screws people!"}
{"text":"As many others have mentioned, the food NEVER disappoints.

However, this location is horribly mismanaged.  The staff, some friendly, some not at all, differ from every other PF Chang's I've ever been to.  Hostesses are absolutely horrible.  Wait staff are friendly, but disorganized and slow.

There's no sense of urgency.

Our waiter, who was absolutely gregarious, but slower than molasses in January, couldn't run my credit card.  \"The manager has to do it\"... WTF??? 

Replace the manager with someone who gives a shit, and the place would kick ass like every other PF Chang's on the planet."}
{"text":"Very yummy ..  loved service Kyle was the best.. cant wait to come back for great service and the best food ever"}
{"text":"I'm in love with there service, the food tasted excellent was served well on time.What i actually loved was the service . I'm sucker for good service and Food. They definaltly met my expectations on that, my waiter was very attentive and loved how he paid attention to details .I would definaltly go back, They break the norm of Chain retsuarants they stand apart because of there excellent service"}
{"text":"I've been going to PF's for years and it's always been great, but for the past year I've noticed the food has gone down hill. The service was great and fast. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The food tasted fine, but no veggies, cheap, cheap, cheap with the rice. No sauces with dishes to put on that bland rice. The dinner portions were smaller than a kids meal at pei Wei. We ordered the 4 course and both left hungry. I said something, and the waiter agreed it was a rip off, but nothing happened. I even left the promo behind for a free appetizer next time. I was fuming at the price and skimpy portions, so I called and talked ton a manger, who invalidated the complaint and did not seem to care. So, the ne star is for those cutting back portions but wanting to pay $20. a person for kids meals."}
{"text":"I had never been to a PF Chang's before eating there in Las Vegas but I was highly impressed with the experience. We ordered from the lunch menu which also came with a free soup. Julia D had tofu and brocoli and I had chicken fried rice. The portions for lunch were huge (I expected smaller) and I ended up taking the rice to eat as an afternoon snack. The combined spend for the two of us was only $30 which made it excellent value and I would happily recommend it to anyone in search of a hearty lunch in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been going to PF chang's for year's now.. and this place has never let me down.. I highly suggest the Sea Bass Fish , and the Ribs.. It is to die for! Also for starters order the lettuce wraps.. I normally dine at the District @ Green Valley Ranch but i just happen to be here at planet hollywood.. i would also suggest calling ahead for reservations so the wait isnt too long.. Place might be a bit noisey but who cares my grou group over powered the noise level and i think we were the noisey ones in the place! For dessert order the great wall of chocolate.. I msut say for those of you who wants authentic chinese food this is not the place to go.. keep in mind this is American style chinese food but still the bomb! hehe"}
{"text":"I have to say, as much as I like the food here, I'm not coming back.  Every single time I order to go food it is at least 30 minutes past their estimate.  Too bad they can't do what they say."}
{"text":"This is my sister's favorite restaurant, so we come a couple times per year. She loves being able to mix her own spicy sauce. My cousin is also allergic to gluten so having a dessert option for her (Chocolate dome) was nice. My step-dad forgot to mention he likes his curry \"currier\" but that was our only complaint. My kung pao scallops was great.I also appreciate the personal iron tea pot that stays hot through your meal. Our server was obsessed with refilling our drinks which was not a problem just a little funny. My mom loves the great wall of chocolate but is disappointed not more of us will help her eat it. Last thing, we called to add one to reservation before we left and this seemed to perplex the hostess who answered but still, we had fun and had a nice meal."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at PF Chang's is always lively thanks to its location. The food is definitely above average- I like the veggie lettuce wraps and the honey shrimp.
Expect a fairly long wait on weekend nights and there's always a lunch rush. 
They also have the best dessert...it's some sort of banana, ice cream and caramel combo. Or maybe that's wrong- I really can't remember. But I know it has bananas for sure and it may be fried. Anyways, it's amazing and I highly recommend you don't leave PF Changie's without ordering it."}
{"text":"Great food. I've come to love Pf Chang's when it comes to Chinese food. Never disappoints me. Always a 5/5."}
{"text":"PF has improved overall IMO. They got rid of the dishes they don't do so well and replaced them with decent sushi rolls. I don't do sushi here, but have tried some and they were pretty good. Where I see improvement is in the consistency of the food. The ribs are awesome, the Mongolian beef is still amazing, and I like every other I've tried recently. Definitely a top notch chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I liked it. Call me crazy. \"Crazy!\" Thanks. Anyway, call me crazy, but I've never been to P F Chang's before. I just knew people love it. I actually did try their frozen dinners sold at Harris Teeter. They were... not so impressive. That's probably why I never went to their restaurant.

Now, we walked around the Phillip's Place to look for a place to eat on Saturday night and at the time, P F Chang's was jam packed. The wait would have been 45 minutes so we went to Dean & Deluca nearby. The next day, however, there were no lines around 3:30 pm. My wife and I B-lined to the place and had a great early dinner at 4 pm.

I ordered the crab wantons for starter, and the new Korean steak bulgogi for entree. My wife ordered the Spicy chicken. They were all really good. Now, I'm easy to please if you have anything that has 'bulgogi' or 'galbi' in its name. But I'll be honest as to why I like it or dislike it. And I do loathe some unworthy knockoffs that shouldn't bare the name. This time, the Steak Bulgogi was good enough to keep its name. Needless to say, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I love PF Chang's and have since I was little! It seems like some stuff has changed a little bit though. I was disappointed that our lettuce wraps only came with 3 pieces of lettuce, granted we were given more after we asked. But they were still delicious! Our dinner was great-Spicy Chicken and Garlic Noodles the Asparagus wasn't too good though...it kind of tasted like cologne to be honest.

Other than that, I will forever stay loyal to PF Chang's and the Great Wall of Chocolate!!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten at other PF Chang's locations, and always pretty dependable, at least to be hot, somewhat spicy and flavorful, and fresh tasting.  And service is usually professional.  But I got takeout at this PFC and the two people at the front counter ignored me, then when they engaged me, they found my food, but did nothing.  Apparently someone else had to ring me up.  I had gotten salt and pepper calamari for an appetizer, and sesame chicken for an entree.  The calamari was cold, and they give you a small container of salt mixed with pepper to season it yourself, with a forgettable sweet sauce.  Not exciting.  And it seems to me that sesame chicken is a layup for a chinese restaurant - tough to screw up - but Chang's did - it was not flavorful, the chicken was dry and the vegetables (broccoli and peppers) were soggy.  it was all edible, but there are two are three cheap chinese restaurants nearby who would do just as well for a lot less money, and they'll be friendly too.  PFC was off their game tonight, or at least at this location!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's up with this location, but every time I visit, I feel like the quality of the food and service gets worse.

We went today for lunch because I was craving my beloved lettuce wraps.  When they arrived, I was just kind of bored with the flavor of them - it was like they were hardly seasoned.  I also ordered a cup of the wonton soup, and the wontons were slimy and overcooked.  I tried to eat it, but I had to send it back... it was a no-go.  However, worst of all was my fiancé's sweet and sour chicken.  I don't know what happened this time (we've ordered it before and know what it usually tastes like), but it was like someone dumped a shaker of thyme in the sauce.  It was so strong that I took one bite and my mouth STILL tastes gritty.  My poor sweetie just kinda sat there and sadly stared at his plate.  

I really don't think we'll be back.  Grand China in Henderson is far superior and is very close to our house.  I don't really see why I would return to a restaurant where I pay so much and get so little in return.  Not a fan."}
{"text":"This was the best restaurant experience in Vegas! I know that this is a chain restaurant but we wanted a low key lunch. This was perfect. Drinks were good and food was fresh. Our waiter Lee was beyond helpful and awesome. We will be back next time we are in town. Thank you Lee for making our lunch great!"}
{"text":"I ate here this weekend, while on a trip to AZ.  It helps to be open-minded about food on a weekend away, especially in a whitebread area like Scottsdale.  Even with the lowered expectations, however, the food here was a poor excuse for chinese food.  

My friends and I ordered the following:  Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Peking Dumplings, Vegetable Dumplings, Mongolian Beef, Chang's Lemon Scallops, Buddha's Feast, and Vegetable Chow Fun.

While most of this was edible, none of it was really particularly tasty or memorable.  The Mongolian Beef was overpoweringly salty, the Lemon Scallops were okay for the first ten minutes and quickly got tiring (the fry batter was much too much and the sauce too sweet and gloopy).  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were far and away the best out of the bunch, but even as Lettuce Wraps go, they were only so-so.  The dumplings were good, but it's pretty difficult to mess up dumplings.

The really appalling thing, and what merits the 1-star rating, is the atrocious selection available for vegetarians and vegans.  My brother is a vegan, and he ordered the Buddha's Feast.  It was described as \"Veggies with five-spice tofu, steamed or stir-fried,\" which sounds like a normal Chinese dish.  Veggies, tofu, sauce, etc.

What came out was almost insulting.  It was a bowl of vegetables, steamed.  No sauce, no spice, nothing.  We had to ask the waitress where the tofu was.  When she pointed out some mushroom-looking things (only two or three pieces in the whole dish), we couldn't help but laugh incredulously.  I can't believe they actually offer this dish with a straight face and call it anything other than a side of steamed veggies.  Is it so demanding in this day and age to expect SOMETHING edible and delicious on the menu for vegetarians and vegans?  

My poor brother then ordered the Vegetable Chow Fun (which resembled Chow Fun not-at-all) and barely touched his food.  Have these people ever had chinese food?  I suggest that the menu/recipe design team of PF Chang's take an educational trip to any Chinatown and receive some schooling.  

Oh well.  Even if they DID have something satisfying for the non-meat-eaters, the place wouldn't have gotten more than 2.5 stars from me anyway.

boohiss

P.S. \"I'm a chain restaurant!  Please don't hurt me!\"  is no excuse for sub-par food, sorry folks."}
{"text":"Love the chicken fried rice!! Got it to go and it was still warm when I got home. My only complaint was that the dessert the Great Wall of Chocolate was very dry! This location has come a long way considering 8 months ago it was not at the same level as the other locations."}
{"text":"Don't come after 9:00pm when they close at 10:00pm, terrible! Waited forever to get check and even longer for him to take my card. I guess he needed to clean. Oh and out of parking validations. Seriously???"}
{"text":"We came on an average busy Sunday and were seated around 1. After ordering around 110 we finally got our food at 2. We pointed out to our waitress that the wait for the food was long and she seemed shocked that we said something, and told us the wait was normal. The food was mediocre compared to other PF changs and even getting our bill and food boxed seemed to take forever. I think a simple apology would've gone a long way.."}
{"text":"I'm seeing not such great reviews here for this restaurant.  I realize not everyone is a fan of chains, myself included.  

However, I liked!  It was my first time to PF Chang's.  I enjoyed the Hot and Sour Soup and the Ma Po Tofu (sp?).  Also, our server, Mikey, was very friendly.  He and the Manager were quick to make up for an error on my order that I didn't even notice;  I was too busy enjoying my soup."}
{"text":"Can I give this place ZERO STAR? I would if I can. This place is not managed professionally. Service was super slow and ushers were rude. We were asked to wait 15-20 mins for a table and ended up waiting for 30 mins. Usher raised her voice and told me I only waited for 17 mins. Was it worth for me to reply her? Nope, I was hungry. Restaurant was not full but they were very slow in cleaning. Afer we were seated, we had to wait for another 15 mins. Wait and wait and wait... that's what you are going to do if you want to eat here
Food was terrible and greasy and they charged us $$$ for a crappy american chinese food."}
{"text":"If u want try some delicious Chinese food, try this place, I'm pretty sure everyone knows about PF CHANG's.  Love the spot, great service, great food, not too expensive but the atmosphere is pretty chill. Music choice can be better. But overall it's a great place to have meetings, Dates or just to grab some quick lunch on Ur lunch break."}
{"text":"Not worth it whatsoever! I've loved P.F. Chang's for years and I've given them several chances because of the good service and food we've had in the past. 

After last night we will NEVER eat there again. They hype up the free delivery service but we placed our order at 8:45pm it was 10:00pm so we decided to pick up our food..... well with our luck the food was already on our way home. 

The food was cold and the pad tai noodles WEREN'T COOKED! After spending almost $50 to have a nice night in, all ruined. We're patient and give several opportunities but this just crossed the line. The only edible thing in our order was the wonton soup- it was delicious.

If you're reading this DON'T GET YOUR FOOD DELIVERED. As enticing the free delivery may be."}
{"text":"Delicious food, ordered for pick up, prepared like we like and ready when we arrived. Always pleased with the service and quality of food."}
{"text":"This was my first time going here and it will be the last.   Neither of the dishes ordered had any flavor.  The vegetables in the sesame chicken didn't have any life or flavor in them.  Normally great or even decent service can save a place but not there!  Not once did our server stop by the table to see how our food was.  The manager picked up our plates about 10 minutes and said the server would bring the check.  We sat there for 25minutes after that before the server came over to ask if we wanted desert and finally brought the check after we said no.  I hope he was just new and trying to find his groove but I will not return to find out."}
{"text":"I will never order or visit this restaurant again. I used to order via the local number and place curbside pick up. After getting my order wrong and an hour and a half on the phone, I talked to Kelly at the restaurant who refused to credit me a comped dish for a wrong order. Zero customer service. Never again, PF Changs! You guys suck!!"}
{"text":"We got the Singaporean black pepper chicken with white rice, and chicken lo mein. The former dish was good and the chicken lo mein was not bad. My husband also got these appetisers (I believe it was the shrimp tempura sushi and the shrimp wontons) and he didn't really like them. The food took AGES to get to us and we were seated at a very tiny table even with booths available. Our waitress was incredibly sweet though, and made everything so much more pleasant."}
{"text":"I don't know why there are so many negative reviews for this restaurant. I think they are consistent and the quality of service and tasty food, and cleanliness. Olivia was our server today for lunch. If I was an owner of a restaurant I would be trying to recruit her. You can tell she likes her job and is an excellent representative for this company. I had the lettuce wraps. Yes I miss the assorted oils and mixes the servers would create table side, but I also understand it took too much time from more pertinent duties. Crunchy perfect lettuce cups and the chicken mixture just compliment each other. My Mom had the lo mien only substituted the rice noodles. She loved her lunch. Perfectly cooked fresh vegetables, tender noodles and just enough sauce. They pour a nice glass of wine at a decent price. And do make it for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at P.F. Chang's and it was okay. The prices were a bit high but they give you so much food that it can be worth it. I am a simple person so I ordered chicken fried rice. It didn't have much taste to It so by the time I finished I had soy sauce fried rice because I felt more was needed for my taste buds. The best parts about this restaurant is they have family style seating and the Banana dessert with the coconut ice cream was amazing! 

I would go back for the dessert but not for the food--they also have a pretty good loyalty program so FYI if you go pretty regularly."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! I try to avoid chains, but this location was right by the hotel where my friends were staying so we just thought we'd walk over, so I begrudgingly agreed. Maybe I was overly hungry and had lost all sense of culinary discernment, but I enjoyed everything we ordered: tempura calamari and vegetables--the calamari was not rubbery at all; cauliflower tempura--might be a good substitute for those looking for a non-chicken wing type of appetizer; handmade pork dumplings--as good as those I've had at pricey places; wonton soup cup--flavorful palate cleansing broth; $14.95 honey chicken--not sickeningly sweet like so many places serve it; $17.95 walnut shrimp with melon--wow, creative and uniquely flavorful; side of fried rice-- it didn't taste or look like reheated in a microwave or sitting too long in a steamer tray--nice glossy grains of rice without any clumps. One of us had a beer and another the mango iced tea. Although I think the shrimp meal and the chicken meal could have each been about two bucks less, the prices weren't too far from expectations, and $83.91 is reasonable to satisfy 4 people and give one of us a take away container of an assortment of all that we couldn't finish."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at PFChangs at Planet Hollywood on the strip. The food was excellent, coconut curry chicken and shrimp with lobster sauce.  The server, Bruce, was absolutely great....very attentive to details, cheerful, made great suggestions, and added so much to the visit.  I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"The manager here is AWESOME! We haven't been to PF Chang's in quite a while and didn't see our favorite dishes on the menu. The manager had his chef make our favorites for us. The food was delicious and the staff couldn't have been nicer!"}
{"text":"The waiters and hosts are very nice and cheerful, the presentation of food was beautiful but sadly the food didn't taste as good as it looked. Not to mention, the rice was cold and dried out instead of warm and fluffy. Sorry!"}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of weeks ago. The photo of my food should be enough to encourage you to eat elsewhere. The compensation I received from customer service is enough to make me never return to a PF Chang's restaurant anywhere.

I ordered the Honey Chicken (I order this every time) with no rice sticks. By the looks of the plate I didn't even want to eat it. I wanted to say something but my fiancé gets super embarrassed so I sucked it up and emailed customer service later instead. 

I received 13 pieces of chicken. Considering most families share their entree here, I'm unsure what you would share but I received this plate of unappetizing honey chicken.

I contacted customer service who was very apologetic since they strive for exceptional service food and ambiance here. In return for my shitty food I received a $10 gift card to PEI WAY (had to look this up to find out what it was and that it's owned by the same company) as well as a card for a free large soda, and free cookie. WOW! I was blown away. I was told I would get a \"be our guest\" package in the mail... I was severely disappointed in what was included in this... I reached back out once I got this in the mail, and to no surprise I did not hear back from customer service.

I won't bother being your guest again, I promise! I can find better places to eat for the customer service and shitty food. Your strive for excellence here was a complete fail!"}
{"text":"I've never been a PF Chang's fan.  I like maybe one dish: the fried calamari, which is pretty hard to screw up anywhere you go.  I went recently because of a business dinner.

They get two stars instead of the normal one I'd give them because the service was friendly and attentive, and we got a private room for no extra cost."}
{"text":"I usually love PF Changs and my family and I go frequently. Until recently, the service was great. My family and I will not be returning after our last visit here. I had dinner here about two weeks ago and our server was very rude and he made it seem as though we were a bother to him. After leaving him not so great of a tip and after him seeing the tip we left him, he comes up to me while im waiting in the front for my boyfriend who was in the bathroom and he says sarcastly \"thanks a lot for coming in\" and then I see him go in the kitchen and (keep in mind the kitchen window is all glass) I see him throw the check on the floor. then he picks it up and angrily shows his coworkers. never have i been afraid of a waiter until here at PF changs. Even after explaining to the manager our experience here, he did not give us any compensation or anything. Sorry pf changs! my family and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Normally P.F. Changs is outstanding. This one however is terrible. It was almost like they didn't care. The hostess was just sitting tables in our servers section. Not in any other section in the restaurant. Thus caused our waitress to be so behind. I then witnessed the manager wipe down the tables with napkins. So gross. After we saw this we left. Mind you this was 20 minutes into our experience and our drinks had just been delivered. It is obviously poorly managed and the hostess' do not know what they are doing. Don't waste your time. Go to the Elephant Bar instead!"}
{"text":"I don't want to sound like a grinch but I have to share with consumers today.  We never used pf changs curb side order but since today is Christmas eve we thought  we order out and invite friends over for dinner.  So we order online at around noon for 550pm pick up.  We got there early, 540pm, just to give them extra time.  We did not get our food until 632pm only after my wife spoke to the manager.  BEWARE!!They cannot handle the holiday traffic...
 Look for other options... I will try and upload pictures of the receipt with the time and the tickets from the kitchen.   Idk of the times on the tickets from the kitchen are when the order was placed or when the food was checked out."}
{"text":"Looooove this place. Always get the lettuce wraps, even though going here is considered a treat or for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We usually like PF Changs but something about the orange chicken - we got another order, explained to one of the partner's Peter that it was too tomato based vs orange glaze - still wasn't right the 2nd time but we just took it home and put it in the fridge.  they didn't charge us for it and were gratious - oh well, just an of night I suppose."}
{"text":"I'm a huge P. F. Chang's fan. While some may complain it's a chain restaurant, I think they have some of the best Chinese food out there. The restaurant is large, with oversized decorations making it feel larger than life. I've always found the staff to be extremely friendly, going out of their way to ensure your visit is perfect. The food is fantastic!  My favorites are the Chicken Lettuce Wraps and the Kung Pow Chicken. Make sure you check out the Happy Hour specials. They make some drinks and appetizers very reasonably priced. There are only two drawbacks to P. F. Chang's. They are a little pricey with the average entree about $14.00 each. Also, the portions are not large. Each one is good for one person with nothing left over. P. F. Chang's is a definite stop you should make if you're looking for excellent Chinese food!"}
{"text":"AKA-- Yummy Salty Chang's

Not a place for authentic Chinese food, but they don't purport it and the food is tasty.  Made the unfortunate mistake of looking up the nutritional info from the menu and dear Salt Gods is this place is good for some mighty dessication!  Many of the platters are a step away from just reading \"salt lick with rice and brown sauce\".

That said, salt is indeed tasty.  Their dessert sampler is one of the best options out there for variety and serving sizes, sharing, and giving your youngling their own.  I do miss the banana lumpia option, though.

Service is usually good.  Generally keep the place dark for some reason.  Children's menu is okay.  They do keep the place very clean.

They have become rather pricey, which is the only consistent knock I have on the chain."}
{"text":"I've never been to a P.F. Chang's - and as somebody who grew up in Asia, I was pleasantly surprised with how it tasted close-to Chinese. It's nothing to write home about, but still a solid place to have Chinese food. I was in a group for work, and didn't get to see the bill, but I'm guessing it's on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Lunch waiters are slow and lazy I watched two other tables come in and get seated and ordered before we got greeted. 
The were not busy and acted like they did not care. The hostess was not informative. At dinner it was the not like that at all."}
{"text":"Great lunch service. They were quick and pleasant to be waited on by. The food lives up to PF Chang's stabfards. I recommend this over others in the area. 
Thanks Daniel for making out experience wonderful."}
{"text":"first time I trying this place ,chicken lettuce wrap is Good  ,but lo men noodle or pad Thai  was terrible is salted i can even eat ,the waitress very nice try to made another one but it just little bit better  ,never come back this place"}
{"text":"Check your takeout order they constantly make mistakes. Other than that great service and the food is delicious. Recently ordered takeout changs spicy chicken with extra sauce and they didnt have it for me and couldnt whip up and because kitchen was closed."}
{"text":"Great food, great experience. The server Alex made the entire evening a great time. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we came here for lunch- first there was no wait - which is a nice change from the evenings - our waiter Ethan was amazing - very attentive - he gave great recommendations and was all over keeping my sons water glass full -no easy task- our meal was very good and the portions are huge- I look forward to my midnight snack. We got the street noodles that come with shrimp and chicken - the noodles were well prepared- not over cooked and perfectly seasoned - the fried rice was also a big hit at our table."}
{"text":"PF Changs happens to be a favorite among ladies in my life, apart from wife (friends, I swear!).

Well right to the point, the Shrimp cocktail/Dynamite Shrimp and crab wontons with mango sauce are my favorite items. They are perfect companions to a draft beer or a regular mojito.

For the main course, the safest bet would be PF Changs fried rice. Dan dan noodles are savory too. 

Service is courteous and relaxed ambiance. Perfect for dinner after a movie at nearby Cinemax."}
{"text":"They have designated parking spots for \"Take Out Only\", but not a dedicated area for take out. I wanted to order take out and get had me go to the left side of the bar. I waited there for quite a while and placed my order. 

As I am sitting here, I noticed a bunch of other people around me waiting to get someone's attention at the bar. I am guessing the bar is where they want people to place take out orders. I wish they were a little more attentive at this location."}
{"text":"Our food was okay, I would recommend the black pepper chicken. But we were a little bit thrown off by the \"family size\" being so small. Not that we are gluttons, but it really was more like what you expect as a slightly generous dinner entree. Service was okay, we weren't overly thrilled with how often we were simply waiting for acknowledgement that we needed something. All in all I suppose it is about what you would expect from a franchise/chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved it!
We went in during their happy hours and that was the best decision I made in a very long time! They have a couple of appetizers for 5$ each and street food for 6$. We tried their crab wontons in spicy plum sauce. It looks and tastes amazing! We finished them off in about 30 seconds, I barely got a picture! Next for the entree we shared a Kung Pao Shrimp. Another amazing dish! Loved the heat from the chili and the crunch from the peanuts. The portion was really good enough for two people.
I want to give a special mention to the way the rice was cooked. It was perfect! It had a bite to it but wasn't chalky. Beautifully done!
The ambiance is beautiful too! All in all a satisfying late Wednesday lunch summed up! :)"}
{"text":"My flight back to DC was at midnight two Sundays ago.  I still had my room at Planet Hollywood and it was dinner time and I was starving.  I was going to be eating by myself, something that I usually don't enjoy doing so I tried to be good and quell my hunger with a fabulously healthy and nutritious Strawberry Whirl (with Immunity boost.. god I don't want to get this flu!) which I got inside the millennium mall next door.  I was restless and alone and needed some fresh air so I took a walk outside in the cold air with my cold drink around the corner to see what was going on at Krave.  Krave is gone.  It closed in October of last year and will be opening downtown in a few months or so the nice valet for the tony looking Italian restaurant that abuts the former Krave location informed me.  I headed back around the corner into the bright lights of the strip.  My Jamba Juice cup was empty.  My hunger was coming back full force.  I felt light headed and in need of comfort.  

I headed into PF Chang's and got a seat at the bar and ordered a Sapporo and some Sesame chicken and struck up a conversation with my neighbors at the bar who were drinking saki and having a good time.  The vibe was great here.  Tony, my server, gave me excellent quick  friendly up beat service.  After I was warmed up a bit with my food and friendly surroundings two beefy cowboys from Houston took the seats on the other side of me at the bar.  They ended up drinking saki too and we had a great time talking and I didn't feel like I was eating or drinking alone any more.   My other neighbors left, and needless to say my cowboy neighbors corrupted me into ordering saki as well and I dragged my meal out for a few hours just drinking and talking with them.  They seemed to appreciate my company as much as I did theirs, but when 10PM rolled around I had to pull myself away and get my luggage from my room (just steps away upstairs at PH) and jump in a cab to the airport.  I did get their numbers though.

Thanks, PF Changs for delivering consistent good food and friendly service.  Wether it's Bentonville AK, Tyson's Corner VA, or even the strip in Las Vegas, NV.  You guys deliver and provide a nice atmosphere conducive to a relaxed good time.

FYI.. The Large Saki I ordered was only $6.50 and packed a punch and I don't even think it was happy hour at the time since it was well after 8PM.. what a value!"}
{"text":"Ate here today. I ordered the spare ribs with fried rice and pork egg rolls. I also had a whiskey sour. Everything was really good. The ribs were tender and the egg rolls were pretty good also. Our server was Sean and he was really attentive and checked on us regularly. I definitely recommend this place, especially for the drinks. Sean was a good representative of their customer service and even talked and laughed with us a bit."}
{"text":"Was here to have Valentines Day dinner with my pregnant gf, the silverware that we were given to us 2 different times still had food stains and residue on it. That was the least of our concerns as that can sometimes happen. I also ordered a beer and requested a glass to pour it into, the glass I got WAS STILL stained with RED LIPSTICK!!! I showed our waitress, she apologized but management was never informed or came to address the issues we had!! Needless to say we will NEVER be returning back to this location!! I'm fine driving to Scottsdale to eat at a decent PF Chang's!!"}
{"text":"The best. I miss the orange pill chicken, the spicy chicken eggplant, and the firecracker shrimp. Bring back the old recipes."}
{"text":"Bartender ANDRE is amazing.  Me being away from home he made me feel at home...if that makes sense."}
{"text":"Was greeted, and seated promptly, The server, Liz came right over, took our drink order, and gave us menus. We ordered the special dinner for two.  The soup were good. Spare ribs  excellent. Mongolian beef was fine.  The honey shrimp was very disappointing.  They very tiny and tasteless. It is a shame they did not use nice sized shrimp.  If it were a $3.95 dish, I could see that, but for $15.00 grossly overpriced..
The dessert Teramisu, was excellent. Service and timing were very good.  A nice experience."}
{"text":"Sushi was nice and fresh, didn't exactly know what I meant when I asked for eel sauce, however it was used as a decorative feature on the plate so that's fine. Main course was pretty good  had the shrimp with lobster sauce, and brown rice nothing to spectacular lol. Ordered a pear Mojito as well, loved the flavor of the pear however I would have liked to taste a little more mint, I'm guessing the pear masks it pretty well. Dessert was delicious, I love strawberries and cream so the shortcake was right up my alley, strawberries nice and fresh too! For the price of an appetizer, entrée, dessert and alcoholic beverage it wasn't bad so I could see myself returning."}
{"text":"Killer happy hour.  Everything is $6 or less. Even a chang job in the bathroom.  I kid.  We got three apps to share.  The Chang's Lettuce Cups are always good. It's hard to leaf them alone. We tried the kung pao street tacos, which were small but very unique and flavorful: they have peanuts, cucumbers, peppers, and the tortilla is actually jicama. We would get those two apps again. However, two of the chicken satay sticks were a little undercooked... ask for it well done, or just double up on the cups or tacos."}
{"text":"So-So

Food was good, the chicken lettuce wraps always start the meal off right. The service was extremely slow, however, with our server constantly apologizing for how long it took to bring our drinks, food, and even plates for our appetizers, claiming they had run out. At the end of the meal, after my wife asked for a to-go container, we were brought two small containers, and were told the restaurant had run out of large containers, which fit nicely with the theme for the entire meal."}
{"text":"Solid 5 stars.  I love P.F. Chang's.  I had a hiatus from Chang's, I switched Indianapolis (Circle Center's) 1 star to 3 and a note \"to be reviewed again\" because they served me raw chicken dumplings, challenged me like I'm lying, then checked and told the manager who was aghast and she was heartfelt and removed the appetizer charge (but I left, I did get sick from the thought of the raw chicken.)  The midwest stores are slacking.  Also King of Prussia / Plymouth Meeting, undercooked spicy chicken.  

But wow am I glad I overcame my hesitation with this impressive location outside and in.  THEN I found out this was Fleming's flagship P.F. Chang's.  This location knocked the Mongolian beef outta the park.  The chicken fried rice also.  (Why did the Chicago 'burb Chang's tell me \"scallions in chicken fried rice are compulsory\", to paraphrase?)  They made it w/no scallions.  My wife loved her noodles.  Great service.  Then they tried to make up for the eastern P.F. Chang's airballs w/free dessert which we politely declined since were were full.  I checked the seats, they were free of detritus.  The bathroom was tidy.  It's clear why this is the P.F. Chang's flagship.  AWESOME work, Scottsdale, AZ P.F. Chang's.  It was the best lunch on our trip."}
{"text":"Meh.....about all I can say.  Had the chicken lettuce cups and cucumber salad for my entree.  Too bad it came out while we were still enjoying our app.   Cold salad on hot plate, grrrrrr.  Service ok. But table for two gets very crowded when apps and entrees there together. Service friendly enough.  LOUD neighbors endlessly talking about her dental work.  Maybe a better bet would be Shuhei down the street."}
{"text":"Still ugh
Ordered the honey shrimp.
Just so so ...reminds me of asian fast food.
Service was poor too.
A shame ..  Used to love it there."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour with a big group. 

I believe 3 pieces of dim sum were almost $5 and the Chicken Lettuce Wraps were $6. This is a little more pricey for you're average happy hour special. The wraps were especially tasty, but the dim sum was A-OK in my opinion. A little expensive for three pieces that didn't make you full.

I also tried the Spicy Shrimp Kogi, and it was OK as well. I've had better Korean tacos from the food trucks in LA.  

This places needs better specials for happy hour and more flavor for their dim sum and tacos. I'm still a huge fan of their Chicken Lettuce Wraps.

{"text":"We only came here because our friends visiting from out of state didn't want to wait 45 minutes to get into Burgatory. They were spotting the tab, and the better half had medication to take, so a hasty decision to go to PF Chang's was made, and I came to revile it was much as any other discerning diner. 

To start, the service was adequate, and the decor was as eye-catchingly grand as a backdrop to any scene from the video game Mortal Kombat. The food, however, was one fatality after another. 

Our appetizer consisted of Chang's signature Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and they might as well have been globs of Fancy Feast portioned out into leaves of iceberg lactuca sativa, and sweet this sativa was not...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76iX4dpsoho

I decided to order a dish that moderately intrigued me from their seasonal menu: The Chino-Latino Pineapple Pork. I thought I'd be in for some funkadelic fusion here considering its border-blurring nature and vibrant colors, but unfortunately, the pork cubes were underseasoned and somewhat dry, the tart salsa that topped it trying valiantly to liven it up, the pineapple chunks screaming for more backup from the proteins only to retreat due to the overwhelming blandness. 

Dessert was a big beautiful nothing called The Great Wall of Chocolate, and damn did it ever hit the wall sans an airbag...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ie7QHklpU

6 layers of chocolate boredom, I don't even recall finishing it. 

PF Chang's fails to entice not due to an adherence to the increasingly vague idea of \"authenticity\" but rather because their food is what generally happens (I do like some chains and will defend them at times) when Corporate Amerika gets its hands on any cuisine. 

I often see PF Chang's \"materials\" in the supermarket freezer sections. If that isn't indicative of banality..."}
{"text":"Take out food is presented already cold. They tell you when to arrive so I'm thinking the food is being prepared in a timely manner. .. not!!!!  I will not be back. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience recently. The food has always been consistent. But my family and a family friend visited and had one of the worst customer service experiences I've seen in a restaurant of this type. I had to ask three times for soy sauce. When I went to the kitchen to get it myself I was met with a very sarcastic server, and unhelpful hostess, and a manager that refused to take ownership. Very poor experience no one accepts responsibility."}
{"text":"Bad service, rude staff rolling their eyes at each other while serving our food. Food was meh we ordered Mongolian beef and salmon. Kids ordered lo mein they liked it but it was very small portion."}
{"text":"We went on New Years for takeout
It took forever for our orders to be even be taken (10-15 minutes), even though there were nearly 4 employees standing there at the front entrance and no line. We were also there in between dinner and lunch, maybe around 3, so they weren't overly crowded.

Once we finally ordered, our food took nearly 30-35 minutes to come out. I ordered sweet and sour chicken, with brown rice and an egg roll and my friends ordered similar dishes. All of us ordered lunch portions. About twenty minutes into our wait, one of the employees offered us complimentary beverages. We all asked for Sprite. The Sprite tasted watered down and had a horrible after taste, but it was free, so we didn't say anything, because we felt bad.

Once we got our food home, half of it was cold and undercooked. When one of my friends tried to call the restaurant to explain this situation, he was put on hold for several minutes and given the run around.

I don't doubt that maybe they were having an off day, but this food was kind of pricy for what you get and this was just disappointing. I may try PF changs again in the future, but maybe not this location."}
{"text":"Well... Not even sure. The food is good. Crazy good? No. But good. Worth the price? I'm not sure. The service? Garbage. Our waiter checked on us maybe once and when he did, he didn't treat us all that well. I got the sesame chicken and it was good.. Can't complain. But for the price you expect a little better. PF Changs is good, but this particular location wasn't impressive at all."}
{"text":"Kim H. was our server. She did a great job. Her service was spectacular. It has been a long time since I have received this kind of great service from a restaurant server. Keep up the great work. The food was also excellent."}
{"text":"Another bad experience two times in a row. There must be a shortage of waitstaff in Charlotte because these people shouldn't even be working at Walmart. Both times we went for lunch and took an hour and a half. They served soup which took almost 40 minutes to get egg drop and it look like low tide in Louisiana. Big chunks of gray and black eggs floating in my egg drop soup, waitress looking at me like I was crazy. The manager came over to serve our food and asked how is everything I mention I was going to write a bad Yelp review and he said well thank you and walked away. This place used to have a long wait and now there's nobody ever there, now I understand why. Portions are small, service is bad and probably better off going to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Fix it Jesus. Got takeout here on a Friday night. I called and placed my order at 9:10. I ordered the lobster fried rice, bowl of sweet and sour soup, and calamari. I was told that my order would be ready around 10:00-10:05. Having experience with this location, I knew to arrive early because they consistently greatly overestimate the time it will take before food is ready. I arrive at 9:40. There are two women getting takeout in front of me. The first is paying and the other is sitting and appears to already be irritated by the staff. The first lady leaves and I stand where she was. No one acknowledges or greets me for five minutes. Not so much as a \"be with you in a second\". I make eye contact with the irritated lady who obviously shares my pain of feeling invisible. There were at least three people behind the counter working. The lady looks at me and says, \"Takeout is supposed to be to avoid the wait, huh?\" 

Finally, a less than friendly hostess asks the name on my order. She looks at the bags and finds mine. Yes, around 9:45 (15-20 minutes earlier than expected). I give her my debit card and she give it to a male co worker, who ultimately puts it down. So there I am sitting with my food getting colder by the minute with my card in sight, but no one to ring up my order. Then all three hostesses leave. The devil on my shoulder urged me to reach for my card and walk out the door, but that would be some form of theft and wrong so I waited. The girl comes back and ask if anyone rang me up. After I tell her that no one did, rather than doing it herself, she takes off (as my food continues to get cold) and looks for the guy. Unable to find him in the restaurant, she finally returns a few minutes later and tells me that she had no idea why he didn't ring up my order, but that now she can do it. 

By this time, I've been in the restaurant about 15 minutes and I'm irritated and in full diva mode. So I request a fresh order of calamari. The girl finds the man, who I take is some sort of manager. He comes and ask me what is wrong with the calamari so that he can relay the message to the chef. I explain that when I ordered, I was told not to arrive until 10:00, but that I came at 9:40 and my food was already ready. Having waited an additional 15 minutes in the restaurant, I figure that my calamari is at least 20 minutes removed from the pan. Everyone knows that fried food can't be reheated. This manager (?) is an older gentleman with a suit on and is visibly displeased with my request as he notates on paper why I am asking for the fresh calamari. He ask, should I get you fresh soup too? I explain that soup can be reheated without compromising the texture of food. He shakes his head, take the calamari, and disappears to the back of the restaurant.

During this time, the lone positive of this entire visit occurs. One of the hostesses, a young black girl with ombre hair in a ponytail, smiles and ask if I'd like a drink while I was waiting. Could it be..... yes it was... good customer service. I politely declined, but thanked her for asking. Eventually the other hostess (the one who rang up my order) returns with the calamari. Note: It wasn't the manager. What an a**hole. I went home, ate my food (nothing to write home about) and vowed to write a scathing Yelp review."}
{"text":"Visited there a couple weeks ago. Had an absolutely fantastic experience. 
Our drinks were made perfectly, the waiter was extremely helpful and brought our food out perfectly. We ordered the meal for 2. It came with soup, an appetizer, two entrees and a desert. The food was amazing and served hot. You could tell everything was made when you ordered it. Will definitely be back. Highly recommend for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"I placed an online order to be ready the next morning for a large group of people. The next morning I called and was told they were still prepping the food. When I arrived, the order still wasn't ready. The food came out 50 mins after the scheduled pick-up time delaying our work event."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant all 5 stars because the food is always great!! In fact it's my favorite place to eat. The reason then for 3 stars... The long wait on the weekends and the incredibly rude hostess'. The wait staff has always been great no issues there EVER but the hostess' have been so rude and had such a I can't b bothered with you attitude the last 3 times I've been here that I may have to frequent the location at fashion square from now on,"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm furious. I enjoyed PF Chang's restaurants in the Chicago area, and my wife and I have eaten a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.

Tonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.

I imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).

After 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.

What on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?

The food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.

We certainly will never visit PF Chang's again."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain, but I don't mind saying they have my favorite hot and sour soup on the planet. The veggies, the tofu, the broth, it all comes together in that magical white bowl of steaming goodness, perfect for a chilly fall or winter day.  

You also can't go wrong with their lettuce wraps, I mean they are a staple for a reason. There's more than enough to share, unless you're greedy like me, then it's an entree in and of itself. Perfect for lunch or dinner. 

The service here has always been great. I've only ever sat at the bar, but the servers are very attentive and always quick with a refill. For chain restaurant Chinese food, I'm a fan of PF Chang's."}
{"text":"I don't know what the appeal is to P.F. Chang's. The restaurant is beautiful and service is good but the food is over priced and not that great. It won't eat at another one ever again."}
{"text":"Arrived a little before my reservation and was immediately seated in a booth; it was nice not to wait! We ordered Vegetable Spring Rolls, Korean BBQ Chicken Stir Fry, Orange Peel Beef, Beef with Broccoli, and Pork Fried Rice. 

The Spring Rolls were a little greasy but it was nice that the vegetables were crisp and fresh. While the menu says served with sweet chili sauce, it did not taste of sweet chili but rather a ginger based dipping sauce lacking much flavour.  

The Korean BBQ Chicken Stir Fry had to be my favourite of all the dishes. While they warn you that it's \"spicy\", it's not. It just has a very slight kick to it. It was cooked nicely and enjoyed the vegetables that was served with.

The Orange Peel Beef and Beef with Broccoli were just alright. The broccoli, however, was cooked to perfection and I found myself eating more of the broccoli than the beef. The Orange Peel Beef was lacking the real orange flavour you crave with such a dish.

The service was quick but our server kept rushing us. At exactly 30 minutes of being seated, she began clearing plates and entrees before the plates/meals were even finished. I finally just stopped eating and let her take away my plate because I was tired of her constant hounding."}
{"text":"My fav restaurant has never disappointed. I have never been to a bad PF Location- even this one on the strip! Great food and atmosphere at a good price!! Best place to eat a huge meal before going out on the town! Been here 3 times and will most likely be back. Best appetizers are the chicken lettuce wraps and the dumplings."}
{"text":"I am giving P.F. Chang's 5 stars, not just because of the food, which was great, but because of our server Jackie (aka Jackie Chan). She said she was new, but her service was that of a long-time employee. She was attentive, funny and knew the menu. Jackie recommended beers and wine, and talked us into dessert. The five of us had a great time!  Getting back to the food - they have a nice selection of dishes. The hot and sour soup was a nice balance of flavors, and we loved the shrimp with melon. Great place to go when you want to get out of the casinos!"}
{"text":"Our server wasn't friendly at all. Nobody ever cleared our plates. The managers even walked right past our table full of dirty plates and didn't life a finger. \"How is everything??\" ..... eh not so great. Food was alright (kinda cold) and service sucked. To top it off they sat us in this booth/table right next to another group... it seriously felt like we were having an intimate dinner with strangers. I love P.F. Changs but this location has to be the worst. HEADS UP MANAGEMENT...  nobody likes to have dirty plates all over their table and get some servers with a personality."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for sex and I know it's not the restaurants fault that it took an hour for the party that was sitting there to stop chatting and debating over who's paying the bill but the manager should've gone over and told them that it was a Saturday night and busy and they needed the table and he didn't The only compensation we got was free appetizers which was nice but still the food is average and very Asian tasting."}
{"text":"Me & my employees stopped in for lunch today. We did mention we were on our lunch hour, too mentioned it to our server Jonathan.  We asked several times..we waited over 45 minutes for our food, when it arrived we had to ask for to go boxes & our check.  It took another 15 minutes for the food to be boxed & for the check? The restaurant wasn't even that crowed? No one could explain why it was taking so long.The manager waived the cost an apptizer and that was all..when we got back to our office the food in the containers was 1/3 of what had been on the plates?? It will be a long time before I ever stop in again!! I was so disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Kim was absolutely a wonderful, polite, upbeat, and kind server! I'm visiting from Chicago and this by far was a great experience, see her if you visit here she won't disappoint."}
{"text":"The dinner we had at P F Chang's was one of the best meals we had during our 5 day visit to Vegas. It was the first time any of the five people in our party had been to Chang's, and we weren't sure because it is a chain restaurant.  Everything we had from appetizers to dessert was great, but the best part was our server Jose.  To say he should be mentoring every server in Vegas, would be an understatement. Although he was quite busy, he made us feel like we were his only table.  We liked the food and service at Chang's so much, that we made a second trip before leaving town. For a really good, moderately priced dinner in Vegas, check out Chang's at Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"What happened to P.F. Chang's?  I've eaten at many of their locations and Middleton has been the worst.  Started off with luke warm/cool pork dumplings.   Then the pork lo Mein also came out cold as well after a long wait.  Unbelievably the server then came back out a few minutes later with a new dish of pork lo mein which was also cold.   The female manager on duty and staff all seemed to be walking in slow motion and the restaurant was strangely empty for a P.F. Chang's.   Now I know why it was empty.    What a horrible experience."}
{"text":"done. over. finished
disgustingly dirty plates under our salad entrees. Both to the eye (in spite of the low light) and to the touch. I **dare** you to run your hand under the plates."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great happy hour, loved the mojitos, tuna crisps and mahi tacos. A good PF Chang's experience."}
{"text":"When we first entered, we were seated immediately, but then had to wait ten minutes for water, let alone other drinks. When I ordered a soda, the waiter forgot it. The brown rice was spongy and had to be returned (wasn't just me; my wife agreed). The fruit they gave as a side order for my son's meal was supposed to be blueberries and raspberries, but they more resembled mush. The chef and/or waiter were obviously making no effort to impress. The ribs were great, the Lo Mein was good, and the Sesame Chicken and Wonton Soup were tiny servings and good (not great). We were also served the ribs without any plates, so we had to wait five minutes to eat them, which led to lukewarm ribs. After all this I anticipated some kind of credit, but to no avail. I don't care about the money. I just told myself that if they make an effort, I will return. If not, I won't. They didn't make an effort. I will not return, nor would I recommend this restaurant to anyone. The decor is excellent. Otherwise, you're overpaying for decent-to-good food (not great) and subpar service."}
{"text":"Sure, it was busy, however I sat for twenty minutes with no acknowledgement and no service. The couple who came in after me needed my chair, so I happily gave it to them and left. No hard feelings, just one star."}
{"text":"stopped by here on our trip from ct Keegan was our waiter he was very attentive and informative even hooked us up with free lettuce wraps!! Food was good service was awesome will come back when we move next month"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmm this is one of our favorites on son/mom date night in Cleveland.  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps are very tasty, their Hot and Sour soup is very good.  Sesame chicken and their tofu dishes are good.  As I always say, hold the salt and it would be even better.  My Son Jeff's review talks of shifting of body fluids, and hypertension and WOW is he right.  Why do restaurants use shakers with very large holes in them!  This is another one of those head in a tub of spring water day after experiences, but it is awfully tasty going down. .  GO THERE,  you will like it.  Not necessary to make a reservation if you are a 4:30 to 5:00pm diner. ."}
{"text":"Great food, I had the walnut shrimp with honey dew melon , wow soooooo good , the Brussel sprouts were great.
What made the meal so special was the fantastic service we received from Lawrence, he was unbelievable, took orders from 11 People and did not write anything down, he memorized everyone's orders for not only drinks but for the entire dinner. 
What a pleasant and friendly man .
Lawrence is a great asset to this restaurant, I hope management is aware of his expertise.
Thank you Lawrence for adding so much to our evening.   The five star rating is because of You."}
{"text":"Food is good but kitchen management needs work. We didn't order anything weird but it took over 45 minutes to get our food and when it came it was iced cold like it had been sitting a while. It's very frustrating watching people come in after you and watching them eat while you still wait for cold food. Waiter kept coming by and saying it would be ready shortly. Didn't happen. Had to spend more time waiting for food to be remade. Manager got to it quickly but it was somewhat annoying."}
{"text":"First of all the food is over priced. I stopped here for a birthday and got a beef plate. I am not picky but my gf is and she didn't like it. The dishes are disgusting and your able to taste seafood. The executive chef is a moron and had no idea why I could taste seafood. Never going back here again."}
{"text":"Why?  I am not sure why people over pay for mediocre American Chinese food?  After the $160 tab between 3 couples I was confused as to where I was eating?  Not gourmet food, just a step above Panda express with smaller portions and fancy decor?  Sorry not my first choice to go to dinner.  If you are reading this review find somewhere else to eat.  Yes service is great, but I came for the food...."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch yesterday and we had an excellent experience. Our server was charming and never let us want for anything. We started with our drinks and Lettuce Wraps and they were fresh and tasty. Our meals of Peppered Steak and Almond Cashew Chicken was gorgeously presented and the taste was quite yummy. The cute desserts were  yummy so all in all it was a great time."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend love Chinese food me not so much but I  said why not its his birthday. It was very low lighting where it could be a intimate setting but it was kind of bad for me to get a good picture for you guys. I ordered the honey crunchy chicken with brown rice he ordered the Mongolian steak with white rice. We also got the California roll with eel sauce. So to start the servings are family style definitely shareable. I didn't get to taste his food because I don't eat beef but he said it was really good they were just a little stingy with the sauce for his rice. The chicken for me was really good it also had like some crunchy noodle strings which assisted with the church of the chicken being the chicken is coated. I'm not a big rice fan but I will say my brown rice was a little dry. It was his birthday and I noted that when making reservation and they did not forget. They didn't make a big hoorah which made him happy. the waitress just walked over and brought him a banana spring rolls with berries and coconut ice cream with one candle which was enough for him as far as excitement level. The dessert was free of charge and it was really good the ice cream was our fave part of the dessert. we didn't realize there was outside seating but there is for you guys who love to eat out doors. the atmosphere outside of the restaurant is way to cute with shopping and benches to sit and cute pictures can be taken. the area is clean and nice. we would visit again it was to crowded and we were seated upon arrival to our reservation. they were great with customer service."}
{"text":"Ok so this is the first time we have been here so not sure if all the locations are the same.   We started off with the egg rolls and they were the best egg rolls I've ever had.  Then came our entre, we ordered the shaking beef & pork lo mein for my husband and I to share.  My husband loved everything but I couldn't eat any of the meat because it was extremely salty, both the beef and the pork in the noodles were very salty so I just ate the noodles.  With that said I wouldn't take any one with high blood pressure to this place.  I don't have high blood pressure and I couldn't eat this meat.  If for some reason we decide to give this place a second chance I will have to order a vegetarian meal."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had P.F. Chang's. Last night my boyfriend and I ordered through Amazon delivery.  Fast, one delivery fee,  and large variety. I also like the pictures of most of their entrees. I've been to this location several times over the years and they are pretty consistent with service and delicious food. 

I started out with their Hot & Sour soup which is perfect in my book.  Spicy but not burn your mouth for minutes later spicy. It's rich and velvety and perfectly done. I went back to a good old stand by,  the Orange Peel chicken with white rice.  The chicken was nice white pieces with a tangy, spicy coating that was amazing.  A new dish we had to try was Hokkien Street Noodles, the picture looked great and when it arrived, it looked and smelled heavenly.  I love the thin rice noodles!!  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the light curry sauce was perfect amount to noodles ratio.  I will order this dish again!! I notice they have changed up their menu adding Dim sum which is nice for variety.  Dessert was New York Cheese cake with berries and it was delicious. Great dinner!!  Thanks P.F. Chang's and Amazon delivery!!  Fresh and hot!!"}
{"text":"Same as their other location you always know what to expect. Good food , pleasant staff, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Good food for a chain. Love their vegan/vege options
MaPo Tofu is a must try
Always the same which keeps us coming back. Friendly staff:)"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan of P.F. Chang's. Took the wife & daughter to dinner there the other night. We had a great time. We seem to always choose a bunch of appetizers instead of entrees and just make a meal out of them. This go around saw us trying their staple, the lettuce wraps, along with the lemongrass chicken pan fried wan tons and the Dynamite Shrimp plus a couple others. The lemongrass chicken wan tons were bursting with flavor. The dynamite shrimp were top notch! Very similar to Bang Bang Shrimp at Bonefish but these shrimp are bigger! Plus they got served in a martini glass (nice touch). A big shout out to our waitress, Ramona, and the rest of the team! Super friendly and very attentive! If there was any complaints it would be the overall set up. The tables are pretty close together so there isn't much in the way of privacy. The food & service makes up for that."}
{"text":"Very good and large portions!

Nice inside out of the sun and heat.  Our waitress was able to find out some questions we had about the strip that she did not know so that was very nice.
She also made a special sauce that was very good."}
{"text":"Been to P.F. Changs many times. This may have been the worst experience. I have always loved the ambience and food. Unfortunately I will not order their lunch special again as the portions are sooo small. The last two times I've walked out hungry."}
{"text":"We have a PF Chang's at home in the Seattle area, but you can never go wrong with PF Chang's, and we always seem to make this a stop when we go to Vegas.  This past weekend we were heading there for dinner and my cousin (who is diabetic) wasn't feeling so well.  We were seated immediately with no reservations and the manager was so sweet, she brought her a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice.  She came over several times during our visit and checked on us.  We had an awesome time (there were 7 of us).  We ended up finding out she was from Washington State and she even worked at the restaurant we frequent in WA.  Planet Hollywood PF Chang's is awesome!!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"So hungover, must replenish fluids with won-ton soup and green tea - Enter PF Changs. It is quick, cheap and will do the trick. I don't overly love it, there are a million places on the strip that I personally would rather go to for lunch but this PF's is a favourite of my other half. I swear if there were loyalty rewards for lifetime achievement of Hot & Sour soup consumption, he would win!  So, inevitably I end up here at least a few times a year. Here are the things on the menu I can recommend for your day after, tequila soaked tummy: Won ton soup, chicken lettuce wraps, Kung-Pow chicken and I do like the mango chicken even though the sauce resembles a colour not naturally found in nature. Oh there is a very extensive Gluten Free menu, so props to that. 

**Note none of these dishes are overly authentic. For a much better Asian nosh head across the street to Noodles in the Bellagio.  However, it will cost you double!"}
{"text":"Used to love going to PF Changs a few years ago and really enjoyed their incredible honey chicken that was crispy and super tasty. My family went about a year ago to this location and said it wasn't great, but we decided to give it another shot. I ordered the lunch portion of the honey chicken with brown rice and got crab wontons as an add-on. The honey chicken was soggy when it came out and not in the slightest crispy, which it's supposed to be. The brown rice was absolutely terrible and way too mushy- it had the same consistency as oatmeal almost. I will sadly not be returning to PF Changs anytime soon and would much rather go to Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Great food. Spent time here with my family my niece just graduated got honors so we celebrated here. Ordered some food just takes a long time for it to come out. But other than that it's pretty okay."}
{"text":"Great food
Nice staff
Waiting time is average
Location is great aswell
Cleanliness is excellent
Me and my family we always eat here.
We had no problems.
Hopefully we wont in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place! The potstickers and the Dynamite shrimp are so good! Also topped it off with Lo Mein noodles! Came back and the Chinese short ribs were awesome. Think they burnt the wok oil for Pad Thai though:("}
{"text":"Other locations are significantly better. This one sucks balls. Service was good, food was poor. Very dissapointed. Oh well, its Vegas this was just a bad bet."}
{"text":"Every time we go to Vegas, I always have to stop here.  The food is good the atmosphere is comfortable. There is one bartender her name is  Robin. She has been here since I started coming around 5 or so years ago. She makes this place feel so comfortable. She always makes us laugh & her drinks are perfect. The thing with finding a favorite bartender is that they never make you feel like you are bothering them. She always has service with a smile!!  That's a great employee!! I always recommend to my my friends and family that live in Vegas or go to Vegas to swing by and see her. I definitely would not come back in to this PF Changs if she wasn't around!
Thanks Robin!!"}
{"text":"My daughter took my husband and I for our anniversary last month.  I have to say this restaurant is one of descent Chinese restaurants in AZ since we used to live in San Francisco.  It's a little pricey but we enjoyed the ambiance, good service and good food.  I'm still looking for a non chain good Chinese restaurants since I love dim sum."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and ordered dumplings, orange chicken, and pork fried rice. There were a few issues... The seat was wet when we sat down. The water didn't taste good so I asked for iced tea instead. They brought me brown rice instead of white. The pork in the fried rice was fatty and didn't taste good. But our server was very friendly and the banana spring rolls were A-MAZING! Makes it all worthwhile."}
{"text":"I have not been a big fan of PF Chang's in the past, but this was probably the best experience I've had at one of their restaurants. A friend treated me to lunch and I had the Citrus Spice hot tea, some Crispy Green Beans, a Vegetable Spring Roll, and the Crispy Honey Chicken with white rice. The tea was very good. I like the little kettle and teacup they bring out to you. The crispy green beans were decent. The breading is very plain... it isn't seasoned like TGI Friday's, but I guess that's why they give you the spicy dipping sauce (which I didn't try). The spring roll was good, but I had to pick out the chopped up mushrooms. Made a small mess trying to pour the little cup of sweet chili sauce... a spoon would have been smart. The honey chicken was tasty and the rice was also good. I usually expect Chinese rice to be dry and flaky, but it was actually good. My only real complaint is that when our server divvied up the food into take out containers, we didn't get any rice. If I had been paying closer attention, I would have asked for some. Oh well. Good PF Chang's meal overall."}
{"text":"Bad customer service from this location. Server forgot the rice and sauces...Mgr said he would do something for us in light of our sever,  who's mind was flying sky high. But didn't do jack shit. Lots of lip service but NO action.
Had to remind our server what we needed several times. Come on dude, do your freakin job. Place was not busy at all. We saw him just talking with the hostess up front with no care in the world. I had enough and said give me the freakin check and we got the hell out.

Too bad the service at this location straight up sucks.
It didn't live up to the service other locations we are accustomed to."}
{"text":"Love the chicken lettuce wrap. Our server Luis really made sure to make us feel well taken care of and knows what to recommend! 
Must try the vegan tofu. #Spicy 
Must try the Mongolian beef!
If you're in the mood for deserts get the banana spring rolls!"}
{"text":"Thought we would try this place for lunch today but it didn't work out .. Me n the co workers work 5 min away and wanted to have a nice lunch on Friday . The place was not that busy and unfortunately we had to get all our lunches to go . So unfortunately PF Changs can't be on our list of places to go for lunch ."}
{"text":"We had a very good experience on our last visit. We came on a Sunday evening and things were fairly quiet. Like many places in Vegas, it can get busy when the strip is busy. 

We were seated quickly and our server was over shortly after.  Drinks came out fast.  Our server was very helpful with our order. After taking our order, he mentioned that going with the \"for 2\" option would be cheaper.  We ended up going that route. 

Another server brought out or app...and another one \"on the house\"...sweet! The apps were good, lettuce wraps and the beans. Our meals came out and we're excellent as well.  Since we had a lot of food, our server helped us pack things up and used small containers so we could stash them in the small hotel fridge.  

A great experience here!"}
{"text":"I have been to Chang's more times than I can count, several locations. On a recent visit for dinner with coworkers, I have to say I was really impressed with the service we received. The server was really incredible, and we kept her hoppin'. They have a good variety of GF items. I got the Lemon Chicken, my usual. I saved room for dessert and got the flourless chocolate cake. It's almost not a cake, more like a heavy mousse or something, it was phenomenal. I don't throw that word out there often, but that was one divine dessert, even for anyone who does not need to eat gluten free. The place was packed and hoppin' for the two or so hours we were there. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really never have any issues with this place, I like coming here for lunch during the workday because they have a decent gluten free selection. When my Arnold Palmer is half drank, they bring me another one without me even asking, which is nice, as this time of year, ones thirst tends to be enormous. I typically get the Ginger Chicken with Broccoli, it's always delicious. The egg drop soup is really yummy and a good starter while waiting for your entree. I do think it's odd though that after ordering GF, they still bring you a fortune cookie, which is not GF lol :) No lost points for it though."}
{"text":"Was there for happy hour. Used the coupon from checking in on Yelp to get a free appetizer. Get the Tuna Tataki Crisps. They are the best. Coupled with an October Fest Sam Adams was the only way to go. The bartender was friendly and helpful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Authentic-NO, Very good- YES! 
We LOVE PF Changs! It's a great value for flavorful food! 
Our favorite starter is the chicken lettuce wraps. (They have a great gluten free selection!) I also love the hot and sour soup. It is very hearty and tasty! Our favorite entree is the Chengdu Spiced Lamb! WOW! The smokey cumin makes this dish very savory! We get it every time! I also like the Hot Fish and the Singapore Street Noodles! Also, the brown rice is excellent, very nutty and cooked perfect every time. 
 The Great Wall of Chocolate is superb, especially because of the fresh berries! For a gluten free dessert you must try the chocoloate dome (also with berries)!"}
{"text":"We came here for my sister's wedding anniversary.  We got there earlier than our reservation time as we were hungry, and we were seated promptly.  We had a nice booth on the 2nd floor in the back.  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  The food we ordered included lettuce wraps, dan dan noodles (not on the menu), broccoli beef, kung pao chicken, and Mongolian beef.  My hubby also had a cup of hot & sour soup,  We all loved our food!  An employee working on a new dish they created brought us a plate of the food, and asked us if we wanted to try it, which we did.  (it was a salad with peanuts in it, but I don't recall the name).  We each ordered cocktails, and those were delicious as well.  I hope to return here again some day when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"The food at PF Chang's is absolutely spectacular!
Food is filled with flavor! 
Makes my mouth water just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, a tad bit pricey but great food and always a good svc..didn't have to wait at all on a Sunday afternoon"}
{"text":"I go to PF Changs in the DC area all the time. The food and service is always great. This PF Changs location was completely the opposite. Our dining experience was horrid. We were among 5 tables in the restaurant and the food took over 45 minutes. They placed all the food down at the table and it was completely incorrect, it was supposed to be for another table. They then took all the plates away and it was another 5-10 minutes until we got the food we actually ordered. They also forgot our appetizer and brought it out with the entrees even though we said we no longer wanted it. The presentation and food quality was horrible. The lettuce wraps were served without the sauces. To top it off, the waitress apologized for the food taking so long because the kitchen was so busy... so busy with all five tables. Towards the end it became comical with how atrocious the service/ food was. 

Not only was our table upset with our experience but from looking around it seemed like the other 4 tables in restaurant were extremely displeased as well. 

This PF Changs experience was completely different than what I'm accustom to at home. I would highly suggest you avoid this location."}
{"text":"I decided to go to PFChangs on my lunch break, I was starving. I get back to the office and plastic in my $15.00 rice."}
{"text":"My luck with PF Chang's has been erratic.  There are times when some of the entrees are excellent and other times when they barely pass muster.  On our last trip (about two weeks before this was written) it was a miss.  The meals were mediocre and uninspired.  On this occasion I would have been better off at a buffet.  I just never know if the meal is going to be exceptional or boring.  

The service was excellent and the decor pleasing but the meal was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"We live the pre-fix menu for its great value and selection"}
{"text":"I love PF changs in Vegas.  I live in Atlanta and can eat at the one there but something about the atmosphere makes the Vegas PFC so much better. 
I have never been in there and less than a 10 minute wait but also never more than 20 minutes and that is not because the staff was being lazy.  It's because they are busy and they are all working hard to flip the tables. 
There is a great outdoor seating area that is my favorite in early winter or early spring.  It's cool at night but they have outdoor heaters that make it great to sit out there and people watch.  PLENTY to see as people walk by. 
The service is usually great. Michael was our latest waiter and he was on top of everything. Drinks were served quickly and our glasses were never allowed to get empty  
Our food was delivered quickly and was delicious. I had the chicken lettuce wraps and they were amazing. 
The cost was very in line for the service and food you receive."}
{"text":"Okay, so the food was average, but the hostess was clueless, she said it would be 10 minute wait for lunch, well the restaurant was empty.... So i asked a family member to request a booth and then the people that were talking to the hostess after us got seated immediately, we were both parties of 4, that is absurd, then they don't sit us in a booth with some lame excuse, then we get a server who wasn't designated to where we were sitting because the other server was late!! So we order our food, and lone behold they sit other people in booths that i requested! What a joke, get it together! Never coming back!!"}
{"text":"The positives- The hostess we're very greeting and polite our waitress was amazing and I'll go back there just for deep fried green beans, absolutely delicious.

The negatives- outside smells like sewage, The lo mein noodles were overcooked the orange chicken was soggy my drink tasted like crap and it was expensive. 

For that experience last night I feel there are many other cheaper more delicious places to go"}
{"text":"Well, not sure if pf changs as a whole has went down hill or just this location.  Went with my aunt for dinner and just completely dissapointed. The ice tea was bitter for starts.  My aunt ordered the lettuce wrap which had to be sent back....how does something like a lettuce wrap get returned you might ask? If the lettuce is so dirty it might as well been dragged through the dessert and thrown on a plate lol the staff was very friendly which was the only saving grace. The portion of food I got for a $15 meal was just weak, a tiny cup of rice, about 12 small pieces of chicken? ?? I was so hungry after my meal I decided to try and make up for it with a slice of cheesecake,  bland and nothing to brag about.  It was disssapointing at every turn. I remember when going to pf changs meant you was going to a quality restaurant,  probably something nice like an anniversary or a birthday gathering. ....now it's like going to the chinese equivalent of applebees"}
{"text":"Nothing was good here. My wife got beef and broccoli, the beef was NASTY. I got a spicy chicken dish, again, nasty. The prices are high, the food stinks... Screw this place."}
{"text":"Wow what great service I would give Shawn 10 stars if I could really appreciated him very attentive management you guys need to spotlight him thank you."}
{"text":"Went here about two months ago and am only now getting around to reviewing it. I think that should stand for something in terms of my experience there.

The service was ridiculous. If one is going to charge the prices they charge for regular Americanized asian food... at LEAST make sure the menus you hand people are clean. Or your plates for that matter. Or silverware. Seriously! Did EVERYTHING have to be covered in grit or a mysterious sticky substance?

Next up... the menu. Not everyone eats meat. How about a little more choices for us who prefer tofu over dead animal?

I ordered the Coconut Curry Vegetables. Bland bland bland. I've had more flavor out of an unseasoned packet of ramen. And would it kill them to actually put some tofu on the plate?

I guess I just don't understand the hype. The prices are ridiculous for the quality received. You're better off going to some little hole in the wall place where the food actually tastes like food and not reheated leftovers."}
{"text":"We ordered a california roll for an appetizer and the spicy chicken and beef for our entree. The food came out quickly. The white pear mojito was recommended by our waiter and it was delicious. The waiter was definitely on the ball."}
{"text":"this is another resturant i like at planet hollywood inside the casino . both times i ate here  i ordered the tofu with broccolli . it comes with a bowl of rice.  the price is ok at $ 9.50 not including tax or tea which is $ 2.50 and both times was almost cold so i dont recomend the green tea. 

the service is ok and not to slow for lunch. its always crowded and noisy . but still a good choice for vegans. the tofu had to much salt and the broccoli is steamed and plain . but a healthy choice. i enjoyed what i ate because its a refreshing change from the all you can eat and puke buffets"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant I like the effort P.F. Chang's
makes.  Their appetizers are all pretty tasty. The calamari is crisp and light.  The sauce is spicy and not too over powering.  The green beans are crispy and batter complements the veggies. The sauce is creamy and spicy.  Very addicting.  Obviously the go to is the lettuce wraps.  

We always order the sea bass.  Just because why not.   It's sweet and fatty and just so delicious. Over a bed of spinach.  Kids love the chicken lo mein and the surf and turf.  

Banana egg rolls for dessert and kids always get the chocolate wall cake with the raspberry sauce. But 1 star deducted bc this time the cake was crunchy.  With every bite there seemed to be like rice crispy or something in it.  Very weird."}
{"text":"Oscar was a great waiter last night! He took care of us big time! He recommended a few things on the menu and told us about the loyalty program- which we signed up for. Our water glasses were always filled in time and he checked on us often. Great customer service! We would return just to have him as a waiter again! Thanks Oscar! Of course the food and atmosphere were excellent too! Didn't even have to wait for a table for two!"}
{"text":"I came here because my email was flooded with \"free entree with the purchase of entree\" coupons. The inside of the restaurant looks nice. My server was very pleasant (the only thing I enjoyed about dining in). But the soda my brother ordered was so flat I'd compare it to a week old 2 liter that's been sitting out in the sun. I've worked in restaurants, fix your dang co2 so we have fresh tasting soda. We asked for water but yeeeesh what the heck water source does this place have? It tasted like it was mixed with dirt. The water from my tap tastes better. Anyways, my brother ordered the Beef and Broccoli and I ordered an Orange Peel and two crab wontons. The entrees were tasty but super skimpy portions for $10+ dollar plates. There's not even any vegetables in the orange peel??? Also the wontons have the weirdest sort of oregano taste to them. I wish I had just went to Pei Wei. The food is the same concept but this place is whack with their prices. Oh then my coupon didn't even work even though it said \"any entree\" don't know why there wasn't something on the email that said it didn't apply to lunch. We took two sips out of that soda and were still charged for it. Wish I took my $35 dollars someplace else."}
{"text":"We recently (ok, a little over a year ago) moved very close to this PF Chang's location. My two sons absolutely adore Chinese food and have been bugging me to go try it out (never been to a PF Chang's). 

1st Visit - we were told the wait would be 20 minutes but it was only 5, which of course is a bonus. Our waitress was a long, dark brown-haired lady, maybe in her 40s to early 50s (don't hate, I'm a terrible judge of age!!). She was absolutely fantastic. She recommended meals, her service was awesome, and she had a wonderful sense of humor. We had the crispy green beans, crab wontons, and spring rolls for appetizers. For our entrées we ordered Mongolian beef, sweet-and-sour chicken, and Chang's spicy chicken (no, we don't eat that much in one sitting and planned to take some home!!). Our food was fantastic and we left very happy.

2nd Visit (3 weeks later) - again we were told we would have a 20 to 25 minute wait but really only waited 10 minutes. Our waitress was a younger girl maybe in her young 20s. This time around the food was just okay, like maybe they got a new chef?? We skipped appetizers this time and just got soup. I ordered the Mongolian beef the first time, and my younger son absolutely loved it, so that was what he had his mind set on for on this trip. He is a young chef in training, and I consider his palette very particular...which is why I was urged to try his food when he said he wasn't too happy with it. I did, and he was absolutely right. It tasted nothing like it did the first time. My older son ordered Chang's Kung Pao and it had ZERO spice. I ordered the Crispy Honey chicken and was disappointed. It was mostly breading with very little chicken, and was overly sweetened. The service was decent - I'd say a 7/10. We had our leftovers packaged up and came home.

3rd Visit (Valentines Day) - once more we were told we would have a long wait - 30 to 40 minutes. We decided to take the buzzer and sit in the car since it was pretty crowded in that lobby. 8 minutes later, the buzzer rang so we went inside (I really think they need to polish up the wait time quotes!). Our waiter this time was Scott. He seemed pretty inattentive for not being too busy. We ordered soup again and each had a bowl. I ordered the coconut curry vegetables this time as I am a BIG coconut fan. The taste was pretty good but I did have to ask for more sauce as the vegetables were very lightly coated. My younger son again, did go for the Mongolian beef. It was much better this time. My older son went back to the Chang's spicy chicken that he had the first time. He said it was good, but definitely much better the first visit. Can the first visit chef please step forward??? We want to come only when you're there!!! Since we had just gone to a movie (with snacks - I know, we did that backwards!) right before dinner we weren't very hungry. So we asked our waiter to box it up and we would take it home. The next day when we went to go into our left overs, there were three tiny boxes of food and one tiny box half full of rice. Where was all our food???? We had each only taken a couple bites (literally), and didn't even touch the rice. The soup was completely left out of the bag. Having spent $70 for dinner I felt this warranted a phone call. I spoke with the manager who assured me that he would look back on the video and see what happened at the end of our meal. He was going to get right back to me. 2.5 days later, I got a phone call from him stating that he couldn't really see what happened in the video feed (what's the point of video if you can't depict what's happening???), and offered a $20 gift card for our inconvenience. Really?? I spend $70 and that's my compensation.

IF we go back to that location again, I will insist on our first waitress (I know exactly what she looks like but I forgot her name), OR we will order our food to go."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite go-to Chinese cuisine restaurant.  However, the last few times I have been there, I have fallen more disappointed than the next.  I think the food is consistent, but extra heavy on the sodium.  Also, menu items seem to stay stagnant without changing here and then.  Finally, it seems as if the expectations for the servers have been lowered.  Do managers still visit the tables?  I think the icing on the cake was our last experience. We were DOUBLE charged on our bill, and when we called it to our server's attention he shrugged his shoulders and walked away.  Yes you heard it...no sorry, no apology, no \"have a good day.\" We were appalled.   (You better believe we will be checking our credit card statement to see if he actually credited our bill.) With that attitude, it almost felt as if we busted him in a scam. Thankfully, we compared the bill with the others who split it with us or else this might not have been caught. I hope management gets it together here and teaches basic customer service skills to their employees. That being said, I will give it another honest try at some point."}
{"text":"I was pretty put off by PF Chang's on my last visit. I am very sensative to spicy dishes and seeing that so many of the options were spicy was disappointing to me personally. I will admit some fault, I asked if the lemon chicken could be prepare not spicy, the waitress said \"Yes\" however when my meal came, it was spicy. I commented about it to the waitress and her comment was \"no it's not\" and did not even offer to get me an alternative dish. I was very disappointed by the lack of customer service. 

I have been to PF Chang's before and while the food was good, I don't think it's better than most chinese food."}
{"text":"DAVE the bartender/server was amazing if you are lucky to have him serve or make drinks for you he is very funny  and helpful I did not know what to order and I asked him for help he asked what I was in the mood for he helped me choose the perfect dinner only downside is parking and their hot and sour soup but everything else was amazing"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner for Mother's Day. What a great experience! Our party of four was seated slightly before our reservation time despite a packed house with a line extending out the door.


Our drink order was taken right away and promptly delivered. Appetizers were also quickly served and delicious. 


The entrees tasted great and freshly made. Desert was excellent as well. Various staff members pitched in seamlessly and made a pleasing dining experience for us.


I've had a couple of bad experiences in this location before and I was looking for something to fault. I couldn't find a thing. The management team team has certainly done their best here. 


Special kudos go to our server, Ruth, for her cheery attitude, prompt courteous service and high tolerance for sarcasm. A shout out to Bob, too."}
{"text":"Had an awesome time with this crew! Giving a HUGE shout out to PAULO! He was a SUPER SERVER. Paid close attention to the needs of the table. He was able to anticipate our needs before asking which is a HUGE plus in my book! (Refilling drinks before they were out, bringing boxed before we asked, etc.) The food was spot on as well! If you get the chance, ask to sit in his section; you won't be disappointed! I'll definitely be returning!  

P.s. Everyone was quite good looking. #AttractiveStaff"}
{"text":"What can I say?  I'm a sucker for americanized asian food.  I was surprised by how good the service was for our group of 5 considering this PF Chang's is inside the busy Planet Hollywood casino.  We were seated quickly for dinner in a large booth that comfortably fit all of us.  Our server was very good at making suggestions and making sure we didn't go dry.  

I love Chang's spicy chicken and the fried rice.  If you've been buffeting it up for a while you'll probably want to share a meal with someone here because the portions are HUGE.  I also love the Kirin draft beer - I don't get to have this very often!  

This is a great option on the strip if you're tired of buffets and overly expensive steakhouses."}
{"text":"Was just there 9/7/15 1 35 p.m.  The hostess tried to set us at a table and we kindly asked for a booth instead because its more comfortable. Right then the hostess attitude changed and she snidely said we would have to wait.  we let her know we did not mind but then looked in the dining area and saw multiple booths open.  We then waited at least 15 minutes, and then just left.  Only gave 1 star cause you could not give less.  I even tried to call and voice a complaint with the manager and was told he was to busy.  Guess I am going to be to busy to ever spend $$$$ at P.F. Chang's ever again!"}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's is a decent chain restaurant that serves serviceable Chinese food. Granted, you'll find much better and definitely authentic Chinese food at your favorite local joint, P.F. Chang's is a fast and friendly way for you to enjoy either a date night or a large group lunch. I do enjoy the serene decor and quiet setting; however, I noticed that the \"background\" music was pretty aggressively loud and a not so awesome genre. 

On this particular visit, we did the \"P.F. Chang's For Two\" - a 4-course, fixed price meal for $42.95. We started with Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps, my favorite item on their menu. Between the freshness of the lettuce, crunch of the deep-fried rice noodles, and spicy chicken mix, it's the perfect bite, every bite. We each had soup - the Hot & Sour and Egg Drop. Our cups weren't full; and, we had to ask for crispy noodles to add on top. Interestingly enough, I can't even remember what we ordered for our entrees because they were so unremarkable. I've usually enjoyed the main dishes here, especially the generous helpings for lunch, but not this time.

I have to say that I've always had excellent service at this location and all others I've visited. Overall, I'm not so sure I would go back for dinner but I would still enjoy some lettuce wraps and a chicken dish for lunch anytime."}
{"text":"Reservation time is not being followed. Had reservation for 8:00 pm was seated 8:30 pm. 
Service was Great service,  johnathan was the server. Superior service"}
{"text":"Great meal on Mother's Day. Our server, Jose, was awesome and attentive.

So many great dishes - definitely something for everyone.

Of all the great choices, there is one that stands out among the rest - you have to get the Dynamite Shrimp. Big shrimp, cooked perfectly with the absolute best sauce ever! A MUST try!!!!"}
{"text":"I walked in for 2 Taylor the host told me to wait a few minutes and they will seat us. Okay cool. Then another party walks up and they got seated right away. Okay what ever. Then when we're about to be seated I asked to sit by the window. Taylor rolled her eyes and gave attitude. My husband and I are here on our honeymoon and were really looking forward to eating here. I got up and walked out because of how we were treated and we will NOT be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"What has happened tp this PF Chaing's? A recent visit was a very disappointing experience. I found the menu items limited and unexciting. No pork entrees, so I settled on chicken & broccoli. This is a go to dish. Not so here. The broccoli was seriously undercooked. So much so it was tough, dry, and tasteless. There was no sauce, juice or gravy prepared with the chicken & broccoli. Consequently, the chicken and broccoli sat atop an equally dry and flavorless mound of brown rice. Totally unsatisfying meal. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Pf Changs is the place to go for chinese food. Its better than the mom and pop shops because they give you way more food.

If you like fried rice get the pf changs combo rice and you wont be disappointed. 

Tammi the bartender at the oldtown location is always great and has good recommendations"}
{"text":"Placed a take out order, and I MUST say , Their sucked. Fried rice was mushy and tasteless, grilled salmon was dry. In general, their food was Tasteless and greasy. This is like the 2nd time I had this experience with this restaurant, different location. The 1st was in a New jersey location (that was a dine in), 2nd and LAST was this las Vegas."}
{"text":"Dumplings, more dumplings, lettuce rack, orange peel shrimp, Moscow mules, need I say more?  YUMMMMMMM."}
{"text":"Treachery! Seek it out:

Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F. Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.

P.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a \"gourmet\" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrées right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced. 

Once you've paid nearly $14 for their \"orange peel chicken\", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.

Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.

Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's \"i\" so that it would \"fit on the signs better,\" or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great \"American Chinese\" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of \"wok charred beef\", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.

The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:

'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. \"Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant,\" Jim told me, pointing at the statues. \"It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing.\" From a Chinese perspective, P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'

Which is just fine, because everything there tastes like death anyway."}
{"text":"Disappointed  expected better !
Been a while  cause became too pricey 
So when I received free pad tai  coupon in email made reservation 
Did not wait but 5 minutes 
Appetizer salt and pepper calamari was good portion small
Pad tai tasted salty and had no sauce
Pei Wei much tastier!!! 
Shrimp with lobster sauce 
Used to be clear sauce lots of egg
This was eatable not how it used to be
Service was fine Busy 
I will go back to pei wei !!"}
{"text":"I came in for the Pad Thai. I am not disappointed. Would do it again . Nice serve before the rush. Large portion."}
{"text":"Wait staff was patient and friendly. Food was perfectly prepared. My food allergies were respected. Very happy with this date night!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy Asian Fusion dinner @ GVR Server was friendly..a little rushed but, a late impromptu dinner ..I'm sure he wanted to go home ;) Chicken Soup was Great....lettuce wraps always a nice share. just can't go wrong ..."}
{"text":"PF Chang's is a typical chain - you can expect the same menu from location to location. Really good experience at the Waterfront with our waiter - s/o David. My friend had the Pad Thai - it was good, but not the best Pad Thai I've had. I had the stir fried eggplant with brown rice...so yummy! I've never tried anything similar to this at an Asian restaurant. We shared the Cauliflower Tempura which was a hit. Tastes very similar to a Sesame Chicken, but with cauliflower instead. 

Even though PF Chang's is a chain and I have to admit, I'm not usually impressed by these big chains - I was impressed with our experience here. Good food, good service. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Here's what Chang's wrote back after I found hair in my take-out. I did respond to them last week but so far nothing back.  By Jove, I do think I've been blown off.

Oh well. Pei Wei is good too.

Casey,

Thank you for taking the time to contact us regarding your recent experience and I feel terrible about the situation.

Please trust that P.F. Chang's takes great pride in our food quality and kitchen sanitation. I am extremely embarrassed and please accept my personal apology. I have forwarded this to our Chef and I know that he will review this with the entire staff. Having said that, I would like to reassure you that this is not something we take lightly. We take the highest precautions in food preparations, and safety and sanitation is our number one priority.

It would be helpful if you could provide a few more details regarding your visit. Do you by any chance, still have the check number available? Did you call and speak with a Manager? Any additional information would be helpful in my efforts to address this further with our team. Please trust that we will take your comments back to our staff and use them as a coaching opportunity to improve where we have fallen short. I look forward to hearing from you.


Sincerely,


Caity Miller

{"text":"The dessert trio was nice! I had the salted caramel cake, tiramisu and key lime bar. I sampled a bit of each and was pleasantly surprised. Although the tiramusu wasn't the best I've had it wasn't too bad. Enjoyed our time here!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was delicious. It was a nice lunch. They have outdoor seating with umbrellas if you want to eat outside. The host was nice too."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a while and I figured I'd give it a shot since I was out shopping it up... The Kung Pao chicken has always been my go-to, so I went for it... I called in my order for pick up and it went smoothly...

Upon arriving, I was greeted and informed they have a new pick up station... I kind of like the idea of picking it up at the bar, but I get why they switched it up... Keeps the seats at the bar free, so it makes sense... I had a few minutes to wait, so I headed over to the bar, though... The bartender was quick and friendly, so that was great... He mixed me a Twisted Whiskey Sour that was positively yummy, so that was worth the trip alone...

Now, I don't know if I put this food on a pedestal in my memories or what, but it was so meh... Almost painfully meh... I don't know if it was the extra spice that I ordered or what, but instead of the light crispness I remembered on the chicken, I got this sort of soggy, spicy situation... Some of the pieces were great, the others were almost unworthy of being chewed... At least the rice was good, I guess..."}
{"text":"Vegetarian lettuce wraps, edamame, and drinks,(Hendricks gin and tonic is superb) are the best around here in the West Valley. Service over and over has been impeccable. Mark and I love this place!"}
{"text":"I only go to PF Chang's because someone else wanted to eat here. As for me, I would not really go here by choice.

Brad T. and I have gone here a couple of times for the happy hour and at first I really enjoyed their food.  However, after a few bites I'm kinda over it and want to barf.  Their happy hour menu is a variety of dishes you can try and recommend it to anyone wanting small portions.  The entrees that they serve is a good size but the quality of the taste is not wahhh wahhh wah..

The service is great and they all seem very friendly. The are fast and efficient with getting out the dishes for you and consistently checking up on you.  

Overall, it is literally A-OK."}
{"text":"because they were the only place left open at midnight serving wine, 4 stars! great service too. we walked in after the kitchen was closed, but, the bartender was still very welcoming. served up mama a nice glass for our nightcap and i had a beer. good times."}
{"text":"Need a new idea for dessert!? PF Chang's has the yummiest treat called \"Banana spring rolls\". Oh my good golly!! These are so fresh and tasty. 

You receive 6 little warm crispy bites of banana wrapped in spring rolls and served with coconut pineapple icecream drizzled with caramel and a side of fresh berries. 
Perfect for sharing or enjoying on your own. 

Since we were there, we also ordered a round of lettuce wraps and Chang's spicy chicken. The wraps had a little burn flavor and we got the inside of the lettuce instead of the larger outside pieces. :(

The chicken was so tasty and we had both white and brown rice. The diet coke was delish and served up all you can drink. 

Dinner was good, but dessert was the best!!"}
{"text":"I went there over a month ago and still remembered the quality service, and the food! It was probably the only place my picky guy approved. I needed to eat gluten free, they were more than ready to accommodate that. The servers were super nice, the food was delish, and yeah, did not disappoint at all. Kinda felt guilty for ordering the sweet and sour chicken for each of the three (or was it four?) different times eating there. Safe, worry free for me, couldn't ask for more :)"}
{"text":"I think PF Chang's is a nice change when craving Chinese.  On our most recent visit, the place was fairly crowded after 8 pm on a Wednesday night.  We asked for a booth, since all were full, we had about a 10 minute wait.  But the host desk is very efficient and when a booth became available, they got it ready right away.

One of the things we like is the sauce they give you and like that you can pour on the heat, if need be.  Beer choices are a bit limited, but BJ is always able to find something he likes.  For our meals, I got one of the winter appetizers.  The Chili Shrimp Bao is 3 little warm pillows folded and filled with bibb lettuce, chili-shrimp, daikon, carrots and cucumber with tamarind-chili.  This dish is fairly small, but a good dish, if you are counting calories.  It comes in at 550 calories and that works for me.  BJ got pad thai which was served with rice noodles and a side of brown rice.  Very good.  Service here is always friendly and I love the interior design of the restaurant."}
{"text":"ok so i've eaten here more than once but just thought to write a review on it. now, i'll be honest this is the only one i've ever been to, so i don't know if they're all the same but every time i'm underwhelmed. i get there, look at their giant selection and get excited. then i get my meal and remember that i've never had anything too great. don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but for how much they charge, they really need to step it up or at least give me a huge portion. just saying..."}
{"text":"This is not the first time I've eaten at PFC, but it's the first time I've dined there and was not at all pleased with the offerings. Ok, so I went with a large group and we ordered from the prix fixe menu ($39.95 for choice of apps/entrees/dessert). Some fried rice, beef & broc, orange peel chicken. All of it was extra salty. The fried rice: zero veggies, eggs only (extra $ btw for fried sted white rice). That too was salty. I have to say that this might be a regional faux pas? Anyway, one thing to ring home about was the lettuce wraps app. Very well, done, although it was hard to recognize the chicken in it. For dessert, the Great Wall chocolate cake wasn't too bad: not so moist, but good frosting. This was meh!! I'd hit up Panda..."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and meal! AS ALWAYS~every PF Changs we have ever gone to lives up to our expectaion from our last visit!"}
{"text":"The margaritas had too much sweetness too them even though they were organic - agave, lime juice, and tequila.

We had the pan-fried pot stickers, but they were barely fried...I wanted a little more crunch to them.  However, the pork was pretty flavorful and I liked the sauce they were topped with.

My boyfriend ordered the Hot Fish, but it was way too salty.

I had a spicy lamb dish with grape tomatoes and mint which was actually delicious.

Unfortunately, the service was definitely \"meh\" and one of the food runners spilled sauce on my boyfriend's pants...not cool.  The waiter offered seltzer water to try to get the stain out, but took forever to bring it to us.

I would give this place another chance, but will definitely ask for less or no salt, and hope for a better waiter next time."}
{"text":"It's always good, I am a fan of the food, lettuce wraps, soup, the brown rice .......    Bottom line its a chain restaurant and we are fans......."}
{"text":"BEST CHINESE FOOD IN LAS VEGAS.   Okay clearly that's not the case, but what can I say, I'm a sucker for the sodium laden dishes PF Changs has to offer.  I usually do take-out which will normally consist of the Changs Chicken Noodle Soup.   Full of pin-rice noodles, chicken, cilantro and tomatoes (and like 4 gallons of sodium), it's spicy and just what the doctor ordered on a cold night.   I actually order it no matter the weather but I imagine it's even better on the 3 cold nights we get here a year.

For appetizers I usually stick with the classic Salt and Pepper Calamari, but this last time we tried some new Edamame preparation they offer which had orange peels and chili flakes and found it fantastic.  The orange peels add a new taste to an old favorite.  We also had the crispy green beans which were nice yet un-extraordinary at once.  

The bastards at corporate (presumably) recently removed my favorite entree from their regular menu, Dali chicken, so I've been doing some experimenting and the last two visits I tried items from their current Summer seasonal menu, the Thai Chiang Mai Curry Chicken Noodles and the Korean BBQ Chicken Stir Fry.   Those PF Changs cooks are masters of all Asian cuisines apparently.  The stir-fry was good, but not something I'd be devastated if it never came back once Summer ends.  The chicken was reminiscent of how Changs does most of their stir-fried chicken dishes, but just with different veggies mixed in and topped with a \"kimchi slaw\".  None of the flavors they tried to emulate really stood out to me which would be impossible if the kimchi was anything like traditional Korean kimchi.  Overall it was still tasty and I was able to finish it all.

I enjoyed the Chiang Mai Curry Noodles with Chicken a lot more.  I prefer the sliced chicken breast preparation of chicken over the other kinds at PF and that's what this features.  The broth is infused with coconut-curry and as a huge Thai-food fan, I was shocked how much it tasted like something I'd be happy with ordering at any of my favorite Thai restaurants in town.   I asked for it to be extra spicy and of course it didn't come close to matching the highest levels you can achieve at a more traditional Thai joint, it still did the trick and the mix of sweet from the coconut curry and spicy was that perfect balance I look for.   I'd definitely order this again.

I've always found the service, from the curbside takeout staff, to the hostesses, bartenders, and waitresses to be courteous.  

4 stars, deal with it haters (and by haters I mean my blood pressure)"}
{"text":"I expected the same quality food I've had at PF Changs on the strip. Not so lucky. The food was mediocre at best. It was Easter weekend and spring break. Every restaurant in the area was packed except for PF Changs. We went in and it was literally EMPTY. Not a good sign. The waiter was covered in arm tattoos and full facial hair - not good for a restaurant. Service was prompt. Our drinks came and they were flat. Food came but it was just so-so. The bill came to $90 for two people. Not at all worth it. The bathrooms were filthy, there was diarrhea and vomit splattered all over the toilet seats and there were used hand towels thrown all over the floor."}
{"text":"When I visit my family in Vegas I am occasionally dragged to what I refer to as the Triangle of Death. The Triangle is made up of the corporate slop of PF Changs, Claim Jumper and Cheesecake Factory. When I am made to go to these places I try to look at the positive side and take it as an insightful social experiment. I submit to Yelp my field report (with help from my Grandma):

1. Grandma: \"Oh, I bet this tastes just like it does in China.\" No, Grandma it doesnt, unless the main ingredient in all their sauces is also high fructose corn sugar. Why does everything here have to be so sweet and offensively created for \"the American palette?\"

2. Grandma: \"Ohhhh, Angelllaa, that drink looks good.\" Yes, it LOOKS good (+1 for fruffy garnishes), but wouldnt it be better with the correct amount of alcohol in it?

3. Grandma: \"What a nice young man.\" Five seconds after this comment our server was complaining (within earshot) about having to repeat everything to my near-deaf Grandma. He is not a nice young man, Grandma!

4. Our bill mysteriously had an extra alcoholic drink added. Server: \"Ohhh, oops! Howd that get there?!\" Trust me buddy, it would have gone a lot better if I had had that extra drink."}
{"text":"I have friends that love PF Changs.I do not fall into that category.We went to PF Chang inside Planet Hollywood as we were attending the Britney Spears show.I was completely underwhelmed."}
{"text":"You know what to expect at P.F. Changs, its inside Planet Hollywood and there was no waiting, got a table right away and love the Chang's Spicy Chicken with brown rice.  Great service always delicious. one of my favorite places to eat, always no matter what city. Try the chicken lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"Three Words:  Overpriced Chinese Food

For a chain, it's not that bad chinese food - not authentic, definitely what you call \"Americanized Chinese Food\", I'm always confused why they come to your table with their \"special sauces\" and then mix it, it's just soy sauce, hot sauce and mustard, am I not correct?  The portions are smaller than a usual Chinese joint and did I say over-priced?  I guess if you're in Madison this could be the place to go for Chinese, but then  you have to pay more for not even really good Chinese.  I've been here more than once with my family, we always seem to gravitate towards here if we want Chinese and we want to sit-down and eat.  The service here isn't the best either, they seem to just pride themselves in there fancy, over-the top atmosphere of \"Chinese\" decorations and huge horse statues mounted outside the front doors."}
{"text":"P. F. Is a beautifully large establishment.  When someone says they haven't ever been to one I'm set back a bit (if you haven't been its worth a visit).  The atmosphere is certainly thumbs up and its always been very clean on my visits.  We always start out with the Lettuce Wraps.  I've traversed several items on their menu - though its best when several entrees are shared with the table (last visit really enjoyed the Crispy Honey Shrimp - the other stuff was just ok).  Food is usually good.  A prior visit - the Pad Thai was so so and the Chicken extremely dry (and they forgot the Shrimp - I was not charged for it).  A friend had the Beef (and both the rice and beef were dry).  Bad night for PF in the kitchen.  Service is usually very friendly - just a little slow.  If I go back I'll stick to the Lettuce Wraps and Honey Shrimp."}
{"text":"With all of the great local chef-owned restaurants in Cleveland, there's no reason to go to a chain restaurant, but if you're set on chains, P.F. Chang's isn't a bad one.  We were in a big group, and the service was slow, but then again there were 13 of us.  The food was good - don't miss the lettuce wrap appetizers, and the coconut curry dishes, moo shoo chicken, and kung pao tofu were very good.  Don't go here thinking you'll eating anything resembling authentic Chinese food; it's all oversized plaster horses and fortune cookies here.  That being said, the atmosphere was nice, they are pretty kid-friendly, and it was buzzing with activity on a Tuesday evening, so clearly it's a popular spot."}
{"text":"We took my son here as a treat for his 21st birthday, good food my favorite was when the lights dimmed and the soft ambience created a very pleasant dining experience. Our waiter was good and made sure he sent over a very birthday treat for my son. We did have a slight issue however, the customer service was great so no reason to elaborate here we were impressed with everything and would recommend our friends and family."}
{"text":"Always great food! They are usually always busy so I order carry out! The consistency is not always on point but close enough that you will be happy. Staff is great"}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this location and yet I had never been to it. I have eaten at other PF Changs in the past. The customer service was very good and the managers came around and asked how we were doing several times. The Chicken lettuce wrap appetizer is one of my favorites. My husband had the dumplings and he said they were delicious. The Mongolian beef and added broccoli is delicious but they could probably cut back on some of the green onions. Overall the service was good and well return."}
{"text":"Do I have to give them a star? Honestly I had never been in a P.F. Chang's before last week. I don't like chains and it's not near my house. Last week we sat in the bar. The food was fast and hot, staff was friendly and drinks were good. Made the mistake of trying the dining room. Food had no flavor, was swimming in what could only be described as brown water, oil was old, service was as inattentive AF! Manager is a cook who tried to help and promised a better experience in the future. No...i will not dine here again even if it's free."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at PF Changs in a year or so. I tend to not do too many chains. I've had really good meals there and a few mediocre. This one was good. My 4 stars are for my experience that evening and happy hour.

We went for their happy hour and definitely ordered way too much food! We were starving. We started with a cup of soup each, not on the happy hour menu but It was only 3.95 for a cup. I had the won ton and he had the hot and sour. We really enjoyed them. I like the fact that the soup came out piping hot. I hate, I mean I really hate when I get a lukewarm soup!!

 Off the happy hour menu we ordered Lettuce wraps of course, always refreshing. My husband really liked their steamed dumplings, we ordered pork and shrimp. Shrimp was my favorite. I really loved the dynamite shrimp, I think it was my favorite!  They were too spicy for my Andrew, I found them perfectly delicious! We also got egg rolls which were good, not great. The spare ribs I really liked and my 6 year old thought they were yummy (we ended bringing her food home, like I said way too much food) but my husband doesn't like star anise much and you can really taste it in the ribs. FYI, we had the wet ones not the five spice rubbed. Lastly, we got crab won tons. I like the filling, slightly sweet, cream cheesy and a hint of crab. The dipping sauce that came with them is pretty good, too.

To drink I got the Chinese 88 Martini but opted Bombay Sapphire instead of Plymouth. They let you do that free of charge. I really liked it. I asked my bartender not to make it too sweet. She was great and attentive and so was the bar back. So we were happy with service.  My husband had the Asian Pear Mojito and he really liked it as well.  He then had a Grey Goose on the rocks, not on happy hour but for roughly 11.00 it was a really hefty pour and we appreciate that!

All and all we enjoyed our meal. Such a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at PF Chang's across the country for years and always had great service and quality food. 

After tonight, you will have to drag me back in. And I will definitely never be at this location even if my life depended on it. 

Around 8pm on a Sunday night. The restaurant was less than full. Two of us got seated in the very back corner, where it was almost too dark to read a menu and right by the kitchen. At the table directly next to us was a foreign couple and their two young kids. No one else seated in the back section whatsoever, in fact the candles for all of the tables in the back weren't even lit. Now, I understand restaurants have sections and server rotations etc etc but I find it really hard to believe there was nowhere else to seat us. I mean you couldn't even sit us with one table in between this family? Not sure if you are homophobic, racist or both but thanks for that.

Now on to the meal.. never in my life have I had my drinks (water and soda, mind you) arrive AFTER my food. That was how fast they wanted us out of there. When the runner brought our food I had to ask him for my drink.. then the waitress came with ours five minutes later. 

Our waitress was friendly but I'm assuming since we were in probably the worst table in the entire restaurant, she knew she didn't have to work very hard. Plus we were in and out in maybe 20 minutes. Keep in mind my partner and I are not dressed like heathens, we engage in zero PDA AND are friendly and coherent people. Whatever reasoning the hostess had for sticking us in the corner like the help is lost on me. I would have been willing to throw down for a nice meal.. appetizers, desserts, more drinks.. but instead I chose to get out as fast as I could. Which was easy considering they wanted us out too. 

Over it."}
{"text":"First time to PF Chang's, very busy for a week night. We waited about 30 minutes which is totally fine for how busy they were. The waitress was very nice and polite, we ordered our food and someone else brought it out to us... Not to sound picky but I hate brown rice and so did my boyfriend. But they gave us brown rice. We asked for white rice and they said they were out, then said they are making some. So we said we would wait. Like wouldn't they think to just wait the 10 minutes for the rice to bring out everything else?! That makes the most sense to me.. Anyway he walked away and gave us no extra plates to put food on and no silver wear. And our waitress was no where to be found. When she finally came by about 10 minutes later we told her what was going on and she was clueless. Took the brown rice back and came back with the same brown rice, while our food has been sitting on the table for about 15 minutes now all cold along with the brown rice. Also the plates she brought us were filthy! Had brown sticky chunky disgusting left overs on them. At this point like what the hell. They weren't even busy anymore. I almost wanted to leave. She took our plates back to be heated up and we saw white rice coming to other tables so we told her and finally got some with our now warm food. Also we saw many plates being brought back to the kitchen at the tables around us. Kitchen was messing up hard. We got there at about 720pm and left at 9pm... Not that the service was bad, but just clueless and they did not communicate with one another. There was no point in talking to the guy who brought us out food. With the cooks, I don't know what the hell was going on back there. How does an Asian restaurant run out of rice. That's like a bowling rink being out of bowling balls."}
{"text":"So I have never been to P.F. Chang's before since I'm Chinese and I'm not a huge fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat delicious authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang's a try. 

We came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. Overall I was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the mood for Chinese/American food."}
{"text":"It's a slightly upscale chain Chinese fusion restaurant. We went for a rehearsal dinner for two friends who met while they were working at a PF Chang's years ago. For that reason alone, it was a cute thought. They did a good job with our large group. There was more food than we knew what to do with. Just be realistic and don't expect a 5 star experience, and you'll be happy with the outcome."}
{"text":"Im coming from ny where food is great, but this place serves an outstanding food. The meat is fresh, (a little too sweet) and very tasty! The service was awesome! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Will definitely come again. I mentioned my meal was too salty, which hasn't happened before, and my fantastic server, Tabatha, notified the manager Rob (without me even requesting), and he comped the dish (also without me asking). We've all accidentally over-salted dinner, so that isn't an issue for me. Their outstanding customer service has my gratitude."}
{"text":"It was our 3rd night in Vegas and we were tired of all the same type of food we had been eating the previous two days so we stumbled upon PF Changs in Planet Hollywood and decided to go for it.  We got there around 7:30 and only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  They gave us a pager which worked about 50 feet into the casino so we killed some time on the slots.  Our waiter was very helpful, suggesting what foods and drinks to try.  We wound up getting the Lettuce wraps which neither of us had before.  They were delicious, definitely recommend getting them.  We split two entrees, the sesame chicken and orange chicken with white and brown rice.  It was more than enough food for the both of us, there was plenty left over.  Service was very attentive, the place was clean, the food was hot and tasty.  I'd certainly go back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Been here a lot, like how you can do online reservations. Restaurant is pretty nice and very big, it can get super busy though. The booths are big but the tables are not so big. The food is very good and the menu is huge, the desserts are also super good, the chocolate cake the the small mini desserts are my favorite. The wait time for food was not long, was bout 15 minutes for all five of us. The appetizers are super good, the spicy green beans and the hot and sour soup is amazing. All of their chicken entrées are very good and I like how you can pick from white or brown rice. The service is alight, I got the hot and sour soup as a appetizer and I got brought out a dirty spoon so I had to wait a good 10 minutes for our waitress to come back to check on us for me to get a clean spoon. She brought me out a clean one which was nice but a clean one the first time was better because I had to wait to eat my soup to wait for a clean spoon. That would be the only reason why I didn't do five stars, and the waitress was sort of rude, but that is normal to me for eating out."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have eaten at various P.F. Chang's in the past. Overall we have been quite satisfied. However, I will forever regret my decision to try their chow fun. We have had this dish prepared at noodle houses and authentic Asian restaurants. Let me tell you, what P.F. Chang's is peddling is NOT chow fun. This stuff is nothing more than egg noodles, a few strips of meat and the slightest amount of flavoring; nothing like dish I am used to with delicious gravy, fresh vegetables and plenty of meat. To say the least, I was disappointed. My fiancé loved her VIP Duck though. Also, the lettuce wraps, which we did not get this time, are always great. The duck and the wraps are the only reason I gave them 2 stars. If it were left to the chow fun they would have gotten -2 stars."}
{"text":"Average at best! Went there for lunch and the food has been undercooked, rice was still hard and they have gotten pretty greedy with their portions. Plenty of other places to eat in the Scottsdale area for the price and quality."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour! Not necessarily the best prices but very good food. Service by Alexis was excellent and very friendly. We had the chicken satay appetizer with peanut sauce which was to die for followed by ahi tuna tartare and banana spring rolls. Overall a great experience. Also the Asian pear mojito is a must try. The dinner menu is quite varied and extensive and I will venture into that territory next time I visit."}
{"text":"Eating vegan in Las Vegas did prove challenging, but PF Chang's is there to help.  This location has the same menu as all the others and I don't even think the food was more expensive for being in Vegas - all the veggie dishes are under $10.  Ma Po Tofu is always my favorite, but I got a noodle dish this time, which was good as well.  They were pretty busy but we got a table in about 10 minutes and had plenty of attention from our waiter."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for years. I like that everything is always kept clean and well menu is of course the same across the board. There is a lot of restaurants in the area but this P.F. Chang's is good especially since it is in Arizona where they are headquartered out of."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to visit our friend working at a bar in Planet Hollywood. This was the only place right next to the bar serving food at the late hour, so we stopped in. I got a strawberry ginger margarita and a lobster sushi roll. He got shrimp dumplings and dynamite shrimp (basically a bang bang shrimp knock off). I liked my margarita but my roll tasted very off - I believe there was some sort of curry flavor in it that just didn't go well in the roll. He and I both liked the shrimp dumplings. He thought the dynamite shrimp was ok, but I was very underwhelmed with the flavor. The server was friendly, but with so many good food options in Vegas, I just wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great food an experience. Went during lunch and had to wait about 15mins but it was worth it. We got the spare ribs as an appetizer and they were amazing."}
{"text":"A fun place to have even if it's a chain restaurant! The decor is inviting and nice, the servers are always helpful with the menu. The happy hour is killer.
PBR's for $2.00, sake $3.00  The lettuce wraps and the tempura green beans are great. If we want a close to home fun spot. PF Chang's is always on the list"}
{"text":"After spending 45 minutes in traffic we arrived for Dinner.  We sat at the Bar as it was Happy Hour. Ruben was our Bartender. Ruben greeted us and we proceeded to order a app and 2 chilean sea bass entree's. While sitting at the Bar i noticed 2 things which bothered me. 
1. The reach-ins were/are filthy and the Bar was by no means busy.
2. Workers talking instead of cleaning.
I have a real problem with dirty dining.
Totally unacceptable.
We will definitely not be Back"}
{"text":"My wife's colleagues come here for happy hour pretty frequently and I'll stop by to join. She mainly wants to go for their lettuce wraps and we usually don't stay for a full meal. I remembered why after we came for dinner on a Tuesday with a gift certificate. The combo was a pretty good deal, the service was good, the food was just OK with nothing really standing out or memorable.

We were seated for our late dinner at 9:15 in one of the U-shaped booths against the wall that faces the kitchen. We had a peaceful dinner in the Asian themed, but modern dining area. The menu is varied demarcating which dishes are spicy, vegetarian, lighter, or new. Our server was Galyna who took good care of us and was very friendly.

The dinner for two for $42.95 is comprised of two soups, one appetizer, two entrees, and one dessert. The egg drop soup and hot and sour soup were standard. The pork dumplings drizzled with a chili sauce were probably the best dish of the night. The minuscule amounts of chicken we found in the chicken lo mein were dry and I didn't go for the sauce in the pepper steak, not much of a garlic or a pepper bite. The banana spring rolls didn't save the entrees but they were a tasty finish.

We appreciate that everything is made from scratch, but this restaurant is designed to put out volume like other chains. I think their happy hour where everything is $6 is solid. If you come for dinner, the \"dim sum\" items have been the most consistent and flavorful for us."}
{"text":"Kendrick, thank you for the awesome service. We were a party of 16 and you did an outstanding job."}
{"text":"I have eating at the of pfchangs for years especially the of pfchangs Northlake at Charlotte North Carolina.  At 3 different occasions when I dine in at the restaurant with an order of ther sesame chicken and white rice, my food was served to me with the stickers on the bell peppers still on each bell pepper in my food which threw me off so I could not eat my food and that my whole dinner was wasted and my money as well.  I took pictures and contacted guest services the next day which I was informed that the district manager will be contacting me within 48 hours and it's been 3 weeks now nobody has contacted me yet neither did they do anything towards my negative experience.  Pfchangs restaurant is truly really getting worst with their food and guest services. I wish I can post those pictures here so y'all can see how nasty their food looked ."}
{"text":"Recently went to the restaurant and not only had great meal & waitress, but the restaurant was extremely clean. Will definitely be returning next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"Considering we had a party of 16 with a reservation, they did a great job.  I'm very happy with the orange ginger edamame, crab wontons, and kaleidoscope roll. All were very delicious and I would order again. Plus despite having our check split up, they didn't add the gratuity in. I would happily eat there again."}
{"text":"The food here is very good and since it's on the strip you'd think the food would be $$$$ but really it's very affordable especially during lunch time. All the lunch specials include a soup and appetizer and the serving is very generous for the price. They have a dining area on the 2nd floor and you have a great view of the Cosmopolitan and the Bellagio fountains from your window seat."}
{"text":"I've been to Las Vegas twice and the first time I went to LV, we visited P.F. Chang's just about EVERY DAY.  The food there was absolutely fantastic as was the service.  We were very pleased.  We went during the Happy Hour, which also included food, and our entire meal would be Happy Hour appetizers like the lettuce wraps and the spicy shrimp.  The drinks were also fantastic.  We always left stuffed."}
{"text":"Tasty Tasty! Just dont sit in the booth by the front door in the winter. You will freeze your booty off!"}
{"text":"Seriously? $14 for a plate with 8 tiny pieces of steak and the rest julienned vegetables? Nearly $10 for chicken lettuce wraps?! And what happened to the sauce they used to make for you at your table? This is just an Americanized Chinese restaurant that tries to be high class by charging ridiculous prices for small amount of average quality food."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST dining experience in a long time! The decor is beautiful, the staff were all friendly - our waiter Dominic was fantastic! He explained the dishes we had questions about, made recommendations, kept our glasses full and helped us relax and enjoy the evening. The food was perfect- we had Crab wontons & egg rolls for appetizers then Sesame Chicken, Lemon Chicken breasts with cold broccolini salad on top and Lemon Pepper Shrimp. All were large portions with enough to take home for next day's lunch. My Lemon Pepper Shrimp was SO flavorful that I will order it again!"}
{"text":"OK. Reviewing PF Changs in Phoenix is like reviewing Delux, Barrio Cafe or some other overly reviewed although perhaps well deserving place. That long incorrectly worded sentence aside, I have to say, we had a fantastic Chang experience. Mostly due to the fact that we were buzzed after the fabulously thrown Gabi yelp event. And we didn't choose to wait for a table, yet sat at the bar, with the other drinkers. We quickly made friends with the bar staff, and diners on either side of us. The spring rolls were crisp, hot and well, kinda bland. Thank you sides o sauce. The mushu pork was dee lish as was the Spicy Chang Chicken. However, riding the bland wagon, was the chicken fried rice. Undercooked and totally void of flavor. The sake was hot, just like the electronics were our diners to the left were hawking. Seriously. He went to his car to retrieve things. Thanks. But no thanks. Service was outstanding. Energy in the restaurant was fun. Unusual for me to give 4 stars to a chain restaurant, unless there's and in and an out in the name. But here goes for tonight. Four stars PF. Four stars! More on service and ambiance than food. But four stars nonetheless!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend told me great things about this restaurant and reported the food was good and there is always a line of people waiting to get in. Luckily I didn't have to wait in a line we were seated fast and the food was pretty good. We had the beef and broccoli and a dish with noodles. The rice that comes with the meal was dry and cold. I was left disappointed as the service was very poor. Will go back for the food, and hopefully better service."}
{"text":"I usually have fair experiences with this PF Changs. I've been inside the restaurant, and have used the curbside to go service. I finally decided to review this based on my most recent experience.

I can't remember her name, but whomever worked curbside to go on Oct 30, 2013 around 6:30PM deserves a mention. She was very nice, and provided us with the exact amount of condiments we listed on the online order form. They're usually stingy with the chili and hot mustard sauces! She also gave us a couple other sauces to try (not sure which ones), but these were very good. 

The food here is always in point. I like to get the edamame, sesame chicken with brown rice, and the flour less chocolate dome! 

I'm reducing a star because of past experiences with service."}
{"text":"Our server was super conscientious about my gluten and nut allergy. I had several menu items to choose from and didn't get sick. Eating Chinese food in a restaurant is a rare treat for me because of my food restrictions, so I ate there twice during my stay."}
{"text":"Worst part about this meal was length of wait.  Took quite a long time for the waiter to greet us once seated and he was only prepared to take our drink orders. In total probably took close to 1.5 hours for lunch and we got there around 11:45 am [so not busy time]. We had been sitting outside long enough we already knew what we wanted to eat.  Ordered an ice-tea, had to remind the guy twice that I would like some sweetener with my tea..awesome.

I also just realized we NEVER GOT OUR SAUCES at all, like they didn't even make it to the table.

My co-worker wanted to start off w/ the salt n pepper calamari.  I would skip this. It was over-breaded and maybe undercooked? I think the oil they fried it is was not hot enough. It was missing the golden brown color you would typically expect from fried food, it was on the pale yellow side. And it was pretty greasy.  We didn't finish it.

Got huge salads [these were very good] I also asked for the dressing on the side, as well as,  the lime dressing on the side too [saw it was lower in calories on their nutrition facts]. Lime dressing never showed.  Ate the salad right up, maybe the best part of the meal.

I ordered the sweet n sour chicken, which on the nutritional info on their site says it's lower in calories and fat. It came out fried.  My co-worker ordered chicken n broccoli [a very healthy choice] it came out not fried. I think I would've preferred mine to be not fried chicken [it didn't say it was fried on the menu] and add more veggies.

They do have outside seating...so if this makes you happy, I'd sit outside order drinks and stick w/ 'safe appetizers' like the pot stickers or lettuce wraps.

I don't think I have to go back to this location."}
{"text":"This people go above and beyond for their service and the food is delightful. I'm not sure if they still have the Jicama tacos but those are my favorite."}
{"text":"At the bar eating as usual.  Nicole is awesome. My wife got her 3 favorite appetizers for dinner . I got the pepper steak after much time looking aftet new menu. Omg all was great. Nicole has always been awesome. We have been coming here for over 10 years. She (Nicole) is why this place is great"}
{"text":"This has been one of the worst restaurant that I have been to in last five years. I have had better Chinese food at a local restaurant than this Madison branch of PF Chang. We went on Saturday night and it wasn't busy at all. The waiter didn't care much at all and came after 15 minutes. It seems he was pissed of when we asked questions about cocktail. Our food came after around 35-40 minutes after we ordered and was cold when we started eating. We had to ask again for warming everything which manager happily did. All entrées are served with rice but we had to ask for them and they came when we were almost done with our food.

In all the restaurant was really disappointing and we all are never going back there again."}
{"text":"Horrible. My wife and l always enjoy coming to Chang's. This time we where told 45 mins. Ok that is fine since usually it goes by a lot quicker. We go and sit by the door. As we sat and watched a total of 24 people leave and 10 parties come in after us and get seated right away. I go ask the front staff, tell her my name, another girl pipes in and said l told you 45 minutes and it has been 23 so you still have 22 more to go. Those people had reservations....me: really...all of them....her: a yes...then after a couple minutes goes by a girl comes over and says there is a couple seats opening at the bar l will sit you there until your table is ready...ok...then a couple ladies walks in and tells them there is a couple seats open at the bar you can sit there until the table come open...finally a couple more seats comes up and we sit down at the bar...the girl comes over and said do you want me to keep your name on the list...me: why...we can eat here we won't get skipped...her: they had reservations....me: not all ten parties...we decided that we did not want to eat there as we will not enjoy...on the way out l asked to speak to the mgr...she was nice but it was to late...told her l did not want to give them my money and her staff had a chance to make it right...goodbye...btw...they have my number let's see if they try to reach out and make it right...hey Chang staff at the front...we went across the street to Logan's and was treated like royalty...maybe you should come across to get training."}
{"text":"After some shopping, decided to grab a quick bite as it seemed not to be busy. All in all a good lunch with a friendly wait staff.

My wife ordered her favorite the Kung Pao Chicken, it was really good and flavorful. I had a cup of soup and shrimp tempura roll. The roll was great, freshly made, really good and no complaints. The wonton soup was pretty good, however did come out Luke warm. Our waitress did say there was some miscommunication in the back with my order and she was not aware the roll came out before the soup. However I did not say anything as it was warm enough and the flavor was really good

The restaurant looked very clean and well maintained except for the restroom as it appeared no one had been keeping an eye on it at all. When I did mention this, I was thanked and observed an employee going to inspect. 

In the end,this was not our first visit here and will not be the last. Still good food and service."}
{"text":"Good food, great wait staff!  Really nice property, nicely decorated and really comfy patio \"couches\".  Price was reasonable. Recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant...always get the best service. The staff are so polite and friendly, place is very clean and every time I visit always exceeds my expectations. I enjoy other locations but this one in particular is by far the best."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Chinese fan, but this place is decent.  We had the honey chicken and the walnut shrimp.  I'd give the honey chicken 3.5/5 and the walnut shrimp 4.25/5.  The atmosphere is nice, but nothing to crazy.  The price isn't bad and the waiter was knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with their chicken lettuce wraps! I usually order these (sometimes two!) as my entree with a side of rice. We've never had to wait long in line and the servers are usually very friendly!"}
{"text":"American Chinese food.  Don't really have appetite for most of the entries. Ordered dumplings and sushi. Dumplings are alright but sushi is really bad. The rice in the sushi is hard dry, not well cooked at all."}
{"text":"I am totally in love with the Oolong Sea Bass.  I had it at another location and was blown away and so I was expecting it to be a one off but I ate it last night at this location and it was almost the same perfection.  

This location is a little more busy with younger crowd than I like but it is close to my house so I went.  The patio is right off mill so if you are looking for a nice dinner I suggest eating indoors.  If you just want to chill have some drinks then outside is great.  

Our server was nice but seemed nervous as she dropped several items which added to some humor in the evening.  Overall we had a great dinner and dessert."}
{"text":"Today we went for our holiday lunch at work and I was very happy and full when we left.  I started out with my favorite the chicken lettuce wraps.  I then ordered off the lunch menu so I got soup with my meal.  I ordered the hot and sour soup which went down in like three spoonfuls.  I followed that with the Moo Goo Gai Pan which was pretty good not the best I've ever had but decent.  Overall 2 out 3 items being amazing and the meal being good I had to give 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've eaten here only twice; the first time I don't remember what I ate, but I remember thinking it was a bit overpriced.
The second time I came here my best friend brought me. She had a gift certificate she wanted to use, and we went in for a late dinner (I'm talking an hour before they close late). We decided to get a special they had for two people; two soups, two starters, two entrees, and your choice of two desserts or shareable dessert.
She ordered the Orange Peel Chicken for the main dish, and I got the Orange Peel Shrimp. 
The Shrimp was very tasty, and had a little kick to it. We shared some spring rolls with the house sauces, and got separate desserts.
The down side was the desserts were little shot glasses full of cake. It wasn't that much. We should have asked for a shareable one, it would have been bigger.
The staff was very nice considering we were there pretty late, and overall the food was alright."}
{"text":"What happened to this restaurant?! I have been a customer for over 15 years. The menu is completely different!! Horrible food! This used to be one of my favorite restaurants! Not anymore. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the Great Wall of china is still on the menu. I'm so disappointed."}
{"text":"I usually do not eat at chain restaurants since i love trying out new places and seeing what other places have to offer..but sometimes i just get the craving for this place and it never lets down. 
From crab puffs, calamari, lettuce wraps all their starters hit the spot! Never have any complaints with anything i have ordered..and if you're a picky eater you are bound to find something since the menu is large. Shrimp with candid walnuts is prob my fave! 

Service is pretty good at this location..it is right by  ASU so it can be hit or miss on being really busy or not.. 

p.s Reverse happy hour is ONLY at the bar, they have some things that are not on the regular menu that you can only order if you sit at the bar"}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but I just have to give a shot out to me and my family's fabulous waitress, Robin.  She was attentive to me and my family's needs while dining. Always had a smile on her face and came to check on us regularly. Did not have to hunt for her. My husband ordered some fried rice, had one bite and it tasted \"strange\" to him. Robin was so kind about taking it back. Recommend a few dishes he might like. He ordered a noodle dish which he loved. She did it all with a smile. Wonderful experience. Your restaurant is very lucky to have such a professional on staff. We'll definitely be back. Robin is our new waitress and if she reads this thank you so much for you service."}
{"text":"I am sad to be giving this place such a low review, but they deserve it. I ordered the ma po tofu with brown rice to go... and they forgot the brown rice. I didn't realize it was missing until I got back to my hotel.  Everything was soggy with minimal flavor.  Sadddd... :'("}
{"text":"I work in Tempe, and every day I bring my own lunch to work - except Fridays when I get take out from PF Changs. The crispy honey chicken lunch bowl is delicious and the employees are nice. The manager is always walking around with a big smile on his face. 

I'm really picky so I modify my lunch bowl to remove the sauce and other parts of the dish and to also skip the soup. So basically I eat chicken and rice and ask for some sauce on the side. Today the manager told me that I can no longer order that because they can't have people \"taking advantage\" of the lunchbowls with modifications. I think this stinks for two reasons - one - they are actually saving with me because I don't take the soup and accoutrements.  Two - I come there almost every week and now..I guess I don't get to anymore unless I order the full size (which is wayyy to much for this belly). 

Oh well! La Bocca is delicious and it is right across the street!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to have dinner at P.F. Chang's and literally sat at our booth for 13 minutes before anyone came over to our table and acknowledged our presence at restaurant. I walked over to the hostess podium after about 10 minutes of being ignored. We usually come to P.F. Chang's on a regular basis because we live just down the road and never experienced such poor customer service. All I can hope for is that our food tastes good because we almost walked out in utter rejection mode:("}
{"text":"I find PF Chang's recent push for \"Farm to Wok\" and healthy, nutritional eating to be absolutely fascinating. I just don't feel like I'll ever be able to associate PF Chang's and health, although I'm happy that they're making the shift!

Complimentary valet is nice, but circle around the Phillips Place parking area once or twice and just make sure you can't get away with getting a space on your own.
The space is honestly beautiful. Very well designed with several rooms with different \"themes\". We were seated in a room with a sliding barn door and Edison lights, which seemed like it could be closed for private events. We started with an order of egg rolls with their trio of dipping sauces, which were hot and delicious. 
I ordered the Lobster and Shrimp Rice, and The Lady ordered the Street Noodles. The other couple we were out with ordered the honey chicken and the honey shrimp. Everything came out hot and fresh, and I loved my lobster. Thought it was well cooked and got a pretty big portion for the price. I also ordered the Twisted Whiskey Sour, which was delicious and a lot of drink for the price.

They recently changed up the ordering system in the kitchen, and they're still getting used to it. Because of that, the tickets were getting massively backed up. Our egg rolls took about 25-30 minutes to come out, and I did ask for them to be comped. Jessica, our waitress, was excellent in communication to us and fantastic in getting her manager. The manager did come out and comp us for our wait, and also provided us a free appetizer for next time. I didn't want that to detract from the star rating, because honestly, they did the best they could and provided us great customer service. It's the little things like that that will keep me coming back for seconds :)"}
{"text":"Dined at this location last night..11/21..food was ok, service not so much. At 6:00 pm the lights inside went down...way down. If this were a romantic restaurant, it might be ok. But there were families in front, behind, and along side our table with children...so I'm gonna go with family restaurant. Stopped the first server who walked by and asked for the lights to be turned up a tad. Her reply was priceless. She said it was time. When pressed for more she said it was the dinner crowd, and the lights go down and there is nothing you can do about it. Asked our server when she came by and she said it was a corporate thing and that was that. No lights, no visit by the manager. Typical chain restaurant response. To the first server who said it was \"time\". You were wrong, there is something that can be done about it. A different choice of restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Marah deserves a 5 stars. We arrived with 2 hungry/cranky toddlers and there was a long wait. She got us some soup for the kids to keep them calm while she helped managed getting a table for us quickly. She followed up and made sure we were comfortable and kids were fine.

The food is good and reasonably priced for Vegas. the service is very good"}
{"text":"My friend had a craving for vegetarian lettuce wraps and then a PF Changs commercial came on TV. It was an omen, let's go to PF Changs! I ordered a crispy green been appetizer. It was the perfect amount of food. Our server, Ross was polite and knowledgable. I think he has worked here for awhile and he was very good! It had been awhile since I had eaten there, but I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food. I even showed up pretty late before closing one night and the staff seemed to mind. I'm sorry for that by the way! The manager and our server both took amazing care of my party and dealt with our late night antics. Last night in Vegas and Redbulls.. I'm sure you get it. Thanks for everything! P.F. Changs in Vegas is the best!"}
{"text":"Our party of six went for lunch today.  We visit this location for special occasions in addition to just going out for no reason.  Although the food was good our waiter was awful. I just got off the phone with the manager to tell her about our experience and she didn't seem to care either.  I had to get up to get refills on ice tea.   Our food took forever so when I inquired about the delay he said, \"that's our schedule today'.  What?  He never checked to see if we needed anything after our food arrived.  Had to get someone to find him so we could pay.  I put my phone number down so he could add our points- he did not do that either. He didn't give us our fortune cookies until he heard us say we didn't even get our fortune cookies.  If we go back I will ask for our favorite outstanding server, AJ.  He knows how to treat customers."}
{"text":"This place is just plain good.  The atmosphere, the service, and the food all come together to form quite possibly the perfect mid-priced dining experience.  As always, the lettuce wraps were a great appetizer.  And I couldn't decide between two entree items, both of which the waitress claimed she loved, so I had her pick for me.  I think I ended up with the sesame chicken and was not disappointed.  Happy hour specials on drinks as well."}
{"text":"Very mediocre at best. No major complaints and no major compliments. Very franchise like with no real personality. The food was okay but really not that much better than you could get at Panda Express. Must say, overall I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I created a Yelp account just to write this review. Believe me, very surprising because PF Chang's is my go-to for consistent good food.  I ordered from the lunch menu for pick up. I arrived 3 mins after it was suppose to be ready. The nice bartender was packaging it up. I got pepper steak with brown rice and egg drop soup. When I checked my bag - all that was in there was the pepper steak entree. I asked the bartender for the egg drop soup. While he went to get the soup, I decided to check my bag to ensure I received the right entree. I'm glad I did, because there was NO rice in there - just the plain pepper steak entree!!! So when the bartender came back with the egg drop soup, I had to ask him for the brown rice!! Truly frustrating and a pain. Especially since I placed the order online 30 mins prior.  As if the experience itself weren't bad enough - when I get back to work (which is literally 2 mins away), the food was cold. The pepper steak was ice cold like it had been sitting there for hours or made a long time ago.  Very disappointing - I will not be returning to this PF Chang's or any other one for a long, long time."}
{"text":"the food was excellent. Kung pao chicken like it's supposed to be  and cashew chicken thst will remain a lasting memory of a special evening before Mother's Day."}
{"text":"First time to this location but many, many times to PF Chang's.

Trying to find parking was a major issue. We finally found parking in a nearby garage and crossed our fingers that we'd get it validated. Good news: PF Chang's had a sign right on their hostess stand saying they validate. Cool!

We were there a bit past 7 p.m. on a weeknight. I was surprised at how empty the place was given the number of people out on the nearby streets and evidence that other, nearby, restaurants looked pretty packed. OK by me, just meant we'd get seated and served quickly.

Service was good and prompt. We tried the salt and pepper prawns for the first - and last - time. The \"pepper\" was red hot chili peppers but that flavor wasn't at all in evidence and I don't have it in me to down a whole chili pepper. The salt was way too intense. The sauce was liquid horseradish. This one just didn't work. The rest of the meal was good.

Happy enough. No reason to stop coming here."}
{"text":"Review #100 for me. Only fitting that it goes to a restaurant I find myself at more than just about any other place.

1st time at this location. 2 hostesses very friendly, dressed exceptionally professionally. We beat the rush so we were seated in a full dining room right away.

Erin was our server. She was friendly and also professional. She had good suggestions and did a good job of complimenting our selections. 

Lobster street tacos were the lead off. We tried the stir fry filet mignon for the 1st time and chicken pad Thai. Dessert was their berry cobbler. The plating was attractive. The flavors were all very interesting and complex. And, for anyone who reads others of my reviews, my mention of having dessert means Erin did a great job by suggesting we have dessert!

On that last point: we were surrounded by tables being served by other servers. Not a single one of those other servers offered their diners the chance to order dessert. Stupid.

Very pleased with this location. The kitchen did a fine job. Happy to know that I have a PF Chang's on the east side I can count on."}
{"text":"Well, it's confirmed. I'm done d-o-n-e with this location.

Nice people, clean restaurant. Tasty lobster soft tacos and steamed pork dumplings. But, that's where this good story ends.

Tried their prawns with noodle entree for the first time. Much better than the salt & pepper prawns. But still stunningly over salted. 

Szechuan beef a standard favorite was inedible. The beef was thin little strings. Cooked beyond death. Tougher than leather. The only flavor was the coating of spice. Giant fail.

The topper was how the server handled things. Now, I'm a really frequent customer so I get a lot of Chang's rewards. It just means I've spent a lot of money on them. So, tonight was a free entree. It doesn't mean they should just pass things off because my tab was going to be lower than normal. I tried repeatedly to let the server know the beef was a disaster. Finally, at the end, when \"to go\" boxes were rejected, I made the comment. It was nearly laughed off. I said, \"the kitchen really let you down on this. They should taste it, it's that bad.\" She had no skills to handle this. No manager was brought in. Nothing. I was not looking for anything to be comp'd. But, management should realize that one reason their dining room is no longer packed like it was years ago has everything to do with a kitchen staff phoning it in and a server who doesn't care at all.

Bummer. This location is right in the middle of my \"I want dinner now\" path frequently."}
{"text":"This update is specific to the new ahi poke bowl appetizer: wow! Generous, high quality cut of fish. Nice blend of crunchy veg and spices. Only negative is the jar it comes in. Dump it on the plate and smother it with sauce. Excellent new item."}
{"text":"Coming down a notch. Maybe that isn't fair but I wasn't thrilled with the experience.

Out very late, working. Driving back in to town from far, far away. Checked their hours online to find they were open until 10 p.m. It was 9:30 when we walked in - I don't think that is \"too close\" to closing to pose a challenge or bother. 

Dining room predictably very empty. Server came by almost immediately. After a quick greeting his first words were, \"Just so you know, the kitchen is closing in 20 minutes.\"

Well, we're practiced PF Chang's customers. So, after a couple clarifying questions about local menu offerings, we gave him a complete order.

Of course, as always, soup preceded the appetizer. Yeah, I get it, the soup is already made and in a cauldron ready to go. Ms. Manner's says: appetizer, then soup/salad, then entree, etc. Not hard. It's not like I had a starving toddler with me (why would I give a starving toddler steaming hot soup?).

The app was served nearly on top of the soup. That happens all the time, too. And, then, shockingly (given the time rush we'd been made to feel), the entrees took a while to show up.

Five stars to the kitchen staff! Everything was prepared perfectly and plated well. Kung pao beef was exceptionally flavorful and tender. Rice was dry and over-cooked. But that was possibly due to the timing of our arrival vs. their closing time.

One star to the oaf who served us. Yeah, I get it. It was the end of the night and you wanted to go home. By our demeanor, and our willingness to give our entire order to you almost right after being seated, I think it was evident we were aware of the timing. We didn't dilly-dally. Heck, we even stacked up all the plates as things were being finished. 

I'm not going to stop coming to this location. It is, after all, location, location, location. And, this one is the best option for dining in the nearby area for me compared to other choices. But, I still hold the Keirland location up as the one that still upholds the best-of-the-best in terms of overall experience."}
{"text":"Today was our 6th Anniversary.  My wife wanted to go out to dinner after our movie and decided to choose this place.  I hadn't been to a PF Changs in awhile, so I was stoked to try it out.  We had reservations for 6pm but we were a bit early and arrived at around 5:30.  The place was not too crowded so we were seated right away.  

When we were seated, our waiter didn't make it over to us for about 5 minutes or so.  Once he arrived though, the rest of the night went smoothly and because of him, this is why this place gets 5 stars.  I will explain later.

For our food choices, we went with their chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer and chicken lo mein and Chang's spicy chicken as our entree choices.  My wife had a diet Coke and I had water.  Here is how the food was..............

Chicken Lettuce Wraps-  These are always good!  They give you about 6 pieces of lettuce (you can ask for more if needed) as well as a huge mound of minced up chicken and crunchy white noodle things.  We always get this appetizer when we come, and it hasn't disappointed yet.

Chicken Lo Mein-  Chinese spaghetti!  Yeah...pretty much sums it up.  My wife loves lo/chow mein and will always order it at a Chinese place.  PF Chang's version is pretty good.  It did not have that much chicken in it, but at least the noodles and veggies were good.  I personally wouldn't order this again, but if I am with my wife, I will at least take a few bites of hers.

Chang's Spicy Chicken-  This stuff was great!  It was lightly breaded and fried chunks of chicken, tossed in a semi sweet glaze.  It wasn't too spicy like the name promotes, but it did have a warming \"kick\".  The portion size of this was pretty large, too.  It was tasty!  It was my first time trying it and I would definitely get it again!

Service-  This is where this meal shined!  Like I said earlier, it took awhile for our server Brian to come over to our table (he was busy dealing with other tables..not his fault), but once he did, he provided excellent service.  He was very personable and asked us some questions about the movie we had seen etc.  He checked on us 3 or 4 times throughout our meal, always had drinks refilled in a timely matter, and was just an awesome dude.  The icing on the cake was that when we were done with our meal, he brought out a plate that had \"Happy Anniversary\" written on it in raspberry puree as well as 2 candles, and 2 chocolate and raspberry dessert won tons on the house.  This was one of the best waiters I can remember having at any restaurant over the last 10 years or so.  He was awesome and did a great job!

Overall, I was pretty impressed and would have given this place about 4 stars.  Food was good, atmosphere was nice, service was great.  I can definitely see us coming back at some point in the future and hope that Brian is our waiter.  He was flat out awesome and definitely made this a 5 star dining experience!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch because they were running a special launching a new menu item, Hokkein Street Noodles. We have so many choices here in Vegas, so I need the incentive to try something new. We checked first with the waiter to define what entrees would qualify for the free deal and were told that we could order a lunch special, a regular entree or even the specialty salads. My hubby ordered the Honey Shrimp lunch deal with a side egg roll. 

Lunch was served promptly. The noodle dish is made with rice noodles and I also requested more chicken instead of shrimp. There were lots of veggies and ample chicken. It was tasty, but likely will not order it again because it was too salty for me. The lunch special was tiny tiny. My husband was not fully satisfied even after sampling my dish too. It is so hard to feel a lunch is worthwhile in this town after going to buffets, especially with loyalty cards and 2-1. We probably won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at any of their locations. The chicken egg roll are yummy and the sauce they serve with them is delicious. Service was okay, food was super fast, strawberry lemonade was yummy and price was way less than I expected. I had sesame chicken and in my opinion it was not as good as the Chinese restaurant I typically go to. My friend had beef and broccoli and said it was good. If you are looking for a nice place, nice atmosphere, good music and something as an alternative to the traditional Chinese restaurant you see in strip malls then give this place a try. They also have a full bar."}
{"text":"Service was good and food was not too bad. The sesame chicken and honey chicken were good. Not too fond of the orange chicken. Quinoa was delicious but don't understand charging $2.00 extra for a small bowl. It had been about 4 years since I was here and I won't be hurrying back."}
{"text":"Decent for a chain, food really salty thou and the prices are higher than 'typical' chiense places but the quality is a lot better,"}
{"text":"I find P.F. Chang's to be way overpriced. If their prices were cheaper I'd give them four stars because I enjoy the ambience, find it a comfortable place to hang out with friends, and believe their entrees and appetizers to be interesting and flavorful.  I liked going during happy hour with a few friends, where we had a lot of fun and never felt rushed. I thought the appetizers were tasty, and my friends liked the drinks from the bar. 

 I don't  mind paying for quality, but I don't think their offerings are worth the prices they charge, so I won't be coming here often, and most of the time it'll be for happy hour with friends."}
{"text":"Wasn't really happy with my experience here. It wasn't a very inviting enviorment. The bar top where I sat was sticky and gross. I ordered the lettuce wraps and the filling lacked texture and was mushy. Don't have any desire to go back."}
{"text":"Yummy food for a reasonable price! I like the shrimp dumplings and the Waldorf salad made out of Kale!

In the Summer months we love to sit in the patio area. And Lawrence is always attentive, fun and just awesome!"}
{"text":"Good food, terrible waiter. The waiter seemed very annoyed with us from the start. He never replied when we said \"thank you\" for taking our orders, bringing our drinks, etc. When he brought our to-go boxes, he knocked water over onto one of our party's laps. He apologized, but then avoided our table the rest of the night. He even had a different waiter handle our check. When I spoke to the manager, Chris, he assured me that he would handle it. That's the only reason this is a 2 star versus a 1 star."}
{"text":"I picked up take out tonight. The dishes that I ordered were full of flavors.  I had the pleasure of having Matthew pack up my order. He offered me a drink to go.  I accepted and took an ice tea.  No one has ever offered me anything without having to pay for it.  Nice touch.  

Wonderful service. 

A few inconsiderate people that park in the take out only parking spaces in front of the restaurant. 
Always remember to take care of the server that delivers your take out.  They work just as hard in the hot kitchen as the servers do on the cool floor.

{"text":"Don't do it. Just don't. You're better of with some frozen boxes out of the freezer section of the grocery store. 

Our dish was half hot, warm in the middle, and cold on the other side. The dessert was stale and bland. 

BF was BLOATED like he was in his third trimester and miserable for TWO days after. Ew."}
{"text":"Killin' me!! I made an order for pick up and asked the guy where the best place to park would be since it's on Mill and I assume there's no curb parking like most PF Changs. The guy tells me to just come park at the curb in front of the location. I clarified, \"So there's a specific spot?\" He confirmed.

I get there and there's no spot. Not a huge deal... I call them again and the same guy answers. I ask him again where to park. He says curbside. I tell him there's no spot for curbside. He says there is. I turn around and go back and he finally says, \"oh, we don't have curbside at this location.\" I ask where to park. He says \"find a spot, maybe in the parking garage.\" I say ok and he says \"have a good day...\" 

No \"my bad.\" No \"sorry I just wasted the last 15 minutes of your time.\" Nothing. 

As I paid for my food I asked who answers the phones. I didn't receive a clear answer. I calmly and respectfully said, \"you guys gotta provide better service on the phone.\" He said, \"ok we'll try.\" No \"what happened?\" No \"what can we do better?\" No \"I'm so sorry.\"

I won't be returning to this or any other PF Changs. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I lived in the Phillips Place apartments when PF Changs opened around 1998. The food was excellent and the service was helpful and the ingredients seemed fresh and high quality. 

Even when they expanded the menu a few years ago and added salads, etc., it was still great overall. 

Whatever happened the the past 2 years or so is sad. The ingredients do not seem fresh, the food actually causes me to have stomach problems, and it's extremely greasy and not particularly vegetarian-friendly. The service is still good overall, though. I still go 1-2 times per year hoping at least the lettuce wraps will still be good, but even those don't have the same magic they had years ago."}
{"text":"So it was 10 pm when we walked in & were seated so this is probably why our service was great seeing as other others on here say their service was horrible. Amazingly this location is open til midnight!

Drinks, appetizers, entree, dessert & check came one after another in a timely matter! Our server was great & personable. The food (like always) was amazing!

Will continue to eat at any location P.F. Chang's offers!!"}
{"text":"I have loved this place since I first came here in 1998!! And having worked for the company for 2 years previous, I can honestly say it's one of my all time favorites!"}
{"text":"Love the food! Amazing server. Egg rolls slightly greasy tho. Long wait but it was Valentine's night. Love the 3 course dinner for 2 they offer."}
{"text":"So PF Chang's China Bistro is a chain restaurant and I grew up eating there, little did I know I was ordering the wrong things all that time. Sure their signature chicken lettuce wraps are good, but their salt & pepper calamari are better! If you're a crab wonton fan, their hand-folded crab wontons will do the trick. For my main course, my absolute favorite is their Sesame Chicken under their Wok Classics accompanied by their fried rice! The egg drop soup is also yummy and my favorite side dish is their Shanghai Cucumbers, gotta try those! I prefer to go to the PF Changs by Fashion Square Mall on Camelback, ask for their server Patrick, or you might find him behind the bar, and if you do, order the Coconut Lemon Sour. He's incredibly friendly and very attentive, he also makes great recommendations."}
{"text":"Uh Oh Uh Oh Uh Oh! when the table shows up and says were in a slight rush and you take 1.5 hours to deliver food and the table has to pound it down real fast means you arent listennnnniiiiiing!

Decent food, not great but relatively clean with some healthy options."}
{"text":"Don't recommend almond cashew chicken. Sauce is bland & had many other ingredients not listed on the menu like green pepper, mushrooms & water chestnuts. Couldn't find many nuts."}
{"text":"First of all, ppl in Cleveland really need to realize that Yelp exists.  2 reviews for a place that clearly a lot of ppl go to = laaame. Although I guess that means that my rating has a way bigger impact on the place's overall score than it should, lol.

OK well ever since it opened and I tried their mongolian beef, I've been gushing about how P.F. Chang's is my \"favorite\" restaurant in Cleveland.  I recognize that that probably means I need to get out more in Cleveland, but it is what it is.

Basically, I love everything at this place, food-wise.  The aforementioned mongolian beef is crazy, CRAZY good, and so is pretty much everything else.  The Chang's spicy chicken is yummy, the chicken and lettuce wraps are great, the wonton thingys are super.

The service can sometimes be pretty wack, since they're always super busy, but you can kind of tell that the service would still be pretty wack even if they weren't busy, ya know?  

So anyway, it's the bomb, albeit imperfect, and I will love it at least until I find a new favorite restaurant in Cleveland (which may not happen anytime soon since I now live in Chicago)."}
{"text":"Our server Tommie was excellent! Very attentive and has great customer service. Definitely look for him when you dine at PF changs"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on a Saturday night.  The place was packed and we waited for an hour for a table.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The food was above average oriental cuisine.  We enjoyed egg rolls (best part of the meal), orange peel beef, and sweet and sour chicken.  Good meal but pricey."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my boyfriend 
Our server was friendly 
But they messed up our appetiser asked for steamed dumplings they brought them fried 
Then our main entrees took 45 min 
We got there at 4pm so not really busy 
We sat in front of the kitchen so we could see our waiter trying to find our food 
I had the sesame chicken with brown rice they brought out white rice 
Then shortly after my meal I was in the bathroom and ruined my night   
I think the food was not ok health was

{"text":"I recently went here for dinner on a wednesday around 6. I sat at the bar and the bartender told me about their happy hour specials which is till 7 at the bar. They have selections of $4 craft beers, $5 appetizers, and $6 dinner which includes sushi and chicken lettuce wraps and more. I started with their Hunan Dragon Wings as appetizer. The wings were very delicious and flavorful. I prefer things a little more spicy and these wings had a little bit of kick to it. The wings had a sweet and spicy taste and was very delicious! I definitely would order this as a appetizers again! For my entree I ordered chicken lomein and vegetable fried rice. Although the fried rice was very good I prefer the lomein. The noodles had amazing texture and the spice level was prefect. The atmosphere here is really relaxing and the food is delicious. The bartenders are very attentive and helpful as well. I would definitely come back for the happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"We went here on happy hour we had hot sake which was nice and a delicious dip! It was a kale artichoke dip with wan-tans! Amazing and different!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday and had to wait a bit but had a drink at the bar. Everyone was so friendly and the food is sooooo good. We had the lunch special and it was plenty. If you use Yelp they also have a spend 40.00 and get 10.00 off . Well worth it. Coming from the NY/CT area we are glad to have found a good Chinese place. 
I had the shrimp and orange and was wonderful. Jay had the mongolian beef, a bit salty for me but he liked it. The hot and sour soup is amazing"}
{"text":"Always good and I loe they serve the hot and sour soup in a big bowl. My only complaint about the pale is they kind of give you an \"is that all your ordering look\" when you only older soup and appetizers. I really hater that and it make me not enjoy my lunch.  I have had the same feeling twice and in two different place. The last one asked us 4 times if we wanted to add anything to what we were having. Hey out bill was still 39.00 so its not like we had soup and left but really, why make good paying customers feel like they should loader a 4 course meal. Not good PFC. Besides that I love the Hot and Sour soup and the Bang bang shrimp are great. Although bigger than what i get elsewhere."}
{"text":"I think Chang's will ALWAYS be a great place to have a date night. 
Great atmosphere, great food, it's really hard to go wrong. Even the service is always good! Sometimes when the wallet is tight, it's even good for lunchtime! 
One thing, though, that I have to say about Chang's, is the fact that I feel like they have a different menu every time I walk in! I'm a very decisive person when it comes to what kind of food I'm in the mood for, but changing up a menu is hard on customers who are almost regulars! Some of my favorite dishes change from Chang's to Chang's and I feel like I'm wasting my money. For example, I've been to three different P.F. Chang's and they all have a different version of the Crispy Green Beans-my favorite appetizer!"}
{"text":"Love the lunch and sitting outside this time of year. I love the fish, all the fish. I ask for rare and it comes out perfect. I'm a big fan of the wonton soup as it has pieces of chicken and shrimp. Sign up for their frequent member club and get free apps and specials."}
{"text":"Service was friendly. Noodles were overcooked. Seeing the kitchen workers slop food onto the prep plates like cafeteria workers was unappetizing. I think this kind of place should not have a view of the kitchen from outside while you're waiting for a table. Production line Chinese fusion done adequately."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, obviously better than your normal Panda Express meal. Portions were nice and family-sized and the place was packed like always. Overpriced in my opinion just like Pei Wei which is why I don't go. I would much rather go to Abacus Inn and get more for my money. 

Why 2 stars? I went with a group of 12 for a birthday celebration. We told the waiter that we would like to pay separate. She told us that was not possible because of the 18% gratuity and there was no such option on the cash register. o.0 \"Eh?\"

We all looked at each other for a minute in silence and told her that it's been done before and we would just split the 18% on all bills. For some reason, she comes back with our whole table's receipt, gives us one pen, and then tells us that we would need to divide it up ourselves and then leave the correct amount for her to pick up not forgetting to include the 18% per person plus tax. \"Use the back empty side of the receipt for scratch paper,\" she said.

This became a 30 minute ordeal as half of us scrambled to get our phone calculators out while the other half tried to get in touch with a manager who for some reason did not exist and it was the hostess who came to apologize and then just promptly left to go back to her position. What was supposed to be a birthday celebration became a sudden blast from Pre-Algebra past. 

Pure laziness or stupidity? Either way, a major Facepalm moment on their part."}
{"text":"NO STARS!!!! I'm a local Tempe resident frequent local restaurants on Mill. Ordered take out and the order was wrong. Specified allergies to peanuts. My order contained peanuts. Safety is not a concern with PF Changs. I called the restaurant spoke to Brad the manager letting him know of my concerns about my order and the danger if the food was consumed to my child. Brad did nothing to fix the order! Brad ignored my concern! I will not order from PF CHANGS again. I want people to be aware of the poor service. Safety!!!"}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's China Bistro is a chain that is located across the states. This particular restaurant was the first that opened in Pittsburgh. It is good to come for lunch since they offer a shared 4 course special for a party of two for around $42.00.

You start off with a cup of soup, It is usually egg drop but they did let us substitute won ton for no additional cost. You then get a choice of an appetizer. We chose two egg rolls which we could split. You get the entree of choice. I had sesame chicken and my girlfriend had crispy honey chicken that was lightly battered and came with rice sticks.

I enjoyed the soup, egg rolls and my sesame chicken. It came with peppers and broccoli. It was very good. You can only order white or brown rice with this special. I would imagine fried rice comes for a slight uncharge. My friend liked her chicken but said that the rice sticks had no flavor to them. 

The last course was a dessert that was fried banana with a scoop of ice cream and some fruit.It came with two forks so it was a bit difficult to split in half but we managed. We liked the banana but weren't too fond of the ice cream. All in all it was a good deal for lunch. They do offer lunch specials during the week for smaller portions as well as cheaper prices. 

They have a full bar with TVs blaring. Located near Barnes and Noble at the Waterfront it wasn't too crowded so we were able unwind and enjoy a nice lunch at a decent price."}
{"text":"Once this restaurant was one of my favorite Chinese places. It is now a hit or miss. My girlfriend and I decided to opt for the dinner for two which included a choice of soup, eggrolls, entree, and dessert.

We opted for the Won Ton soup which turned out to have shrimp in it.I was okay with that since i am a shrimp lover but was surprised to find it in my soup. Still it was good. We got two eggrolls apiece. All we had at the time were forks and knives there was no serving soup for the duck sauce.

When I had finished my first eggroll the waitress was taking away my plate. I told her I wanted to eat the second one later. She said that I could put it on my main course plate that was lying there. Not really what I wanted so I opted instead to take it home with me.

My girlfriend had the sesame chicken which she let me try. I found it to be very good. I had the moo goo gai pan which I thought was somewhat bland. You get a choice of brown or white rice to accompany it.

The dessert we choose to share was raspberry chocolate crepe. We were given a couple of fortune cookies in advance but when we got this dessert the chocolate was scribbled on the dish and two crepes were laying on top of it with powdered sugar. They seemed kind of tough for us to eat.

Again we had to ask for a separate plate and we had no knife to cut it with. We did have a nice waitress but without proper utensils it is a bit harder to enjoy the meal. Course there are plenty of chopsticks in paper wrap but we never use them.

The restaurant wasn't overly busy since we arrived before the dinner hour so we didn't have to wait that long to be served. It is fairly dark inside so it makes it a little hard to see things.

We will probably visit here again when the occasion warrants it but will probably try ala carte next time."}
{"text":"Never going back here again. First visit was with a group, so chalked up the service and food quality to being part of a big group. 

Second time was early dinner with wife and 3 kids. Sat us at a 4 top( for  5 people ) right next to the only other table in the restaurant. Food was blah and service was...eh.

Called to get take out...here's where you lost me:

Told me my 'pick up' time was 50 min from placing my order(?), In the middle of the afternoon after lunch rush. Ok, whatever. So I arrived 25 min eary, just to see what would happen. Food was ready?? So would my food have sat for 25 more min? Would you have given me food cooked a half hour ago?  Asked about this pick up issue, and the lady said:

Me: \"what if I had come at my time? Would my love mein and soup have been cold? Or remade?\"


 PF: \" we gave you a spoon for your soup.\"

Me: \"yeah, I've had soup before but what about the  discrepancy in time.\"

PF: \"I don't know, do you want a copy of your receipt?\"

Me: \"yes\"

PF: \" ok, make sure you total out the receipt here and sign here\"

Me: \"really?\" 

In my head : \"This isn't my first time using a credit card. This isn't my first time eating! What the f@#$ is the matter with you imbeciles?!\"

Never waste money or time here. Awful!"}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's is one of my family's go to restaurants when we are hungry.  We are regulars at the one by my parents place.

Food:  I've always loved P.F. Chang's food.  I usually do the dinner for two and share it with someone.  Egg drop soup by far is my favorite soup.  For app, you have to go with the lettuce wraps, so amazing.  I want the recipe to make the sauce.  As the main course I always go with the sesame chicken, with this you can never go wrong.

Service:  The service at this particular restaurant was terrible.  The restaurant was almost empty, there were only two other groups of people.  Our server was moving at snails pace the entire time.  We sat down and no one greeted us for 20 minutes.  We ordered drinks and our entire meal at the same time.  Our food came out at about the normal time it does about 15ish minutes.  Then the check was suppose to come...  She boxed our food and then she was missing for another 20 minutes.  Kinda funny that we could see her eating at a booth across the dinning room.  All she had was one table left that needed to cash out with the check and she chose to start eating (face palm).

Moral of the story, the food was a great as it always is at this chain, but the service made it a horrible dinning experience.  The most ironic part was that the restaurant had a sign that said \"Join the Winning Team! Now hiring servers\""}
{"text":"Food was served cold. I've been to P.F. Chang's many times out of state and since I recently moved to WI my friends decided to eat dinner at PF Chang's. This was the worse experience I've had at PFC. Vegetables were raw and all our meals were cold. My soup was even cold. The waiter seemed disturbed since we complained but when your paying for a meal that's cold I think it's reasonable to request your food to me warmed since it took 40 minutes to make and it was a extremely slow night."}
{"text":"It's very entertaining reading the reviews on here. I have been to this location multiple times, this is my first review. The restaurant is very clean, decent in size not small as some reviewers say. Although I've been to locations in both Oregon and las Vegas which were bigger this is by no means \"small\" I have never waited, and I have always been given a booth, even today and I am alone! Most restaurants would refuse to give a solo person a booth. So that earns extra points. Within a few minutes I meet my waitress who brings me water without even asking. The happy hour menu is good, it uses to be great a year or so ago but they removed some of my favorites , but don't fret! The still have classics on there like lettuce wraps and fried green beans (2 of my personal favorites) 

So today i ordered a glass of wine, the crispy green beans and the flaming won tons. The favors between the Fried veggie, the dipping sauce it comes with is like a ménage a tois in your mouth. Add in the sweet yet spicy flaming wontons and boom! Well you know what happens :)

The portions vs price ration is swell. No complaints here. 

I am full yet tempted to order more just because it tastes so damn good. 


I drafted this review with 4 stars, but decided I would love to end my mean with the banana spring roll dessert minus the banana rolls ( long story short teeth are sore and cant bite into things) my waitress what cool about it and have me exactly what I wanted! 5th star earned :)

I reccomend this joint and if you've been here in 2010 and gave it bad reviews, come in now in 2012 and see what you think!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, lettuce wrap is their classic and it's good. Thor pear mojito is refreshing, don't get the avaga margarita. Other food is decent but not really Chinese."}
{"text":"I remember this used to be my grandpa's favorite restaurant and would call it \"caballo blanco\" (white horse).
I stopped here for my birthday lunch and the food was just as good! I love their wontong soup, changs spicy chicken, and lo me in. The food was tasty, yet not fantastic. The server didn't even make our sauce for the lettuce wraps and the service really lacked.
Not sure if I'll be back though since the quality seemed to go downhill."}
{"text":"I really like this PF Chang's more than the Waterfront location, it has a much nicer feel, warmer, and a richer look. The waterfront location seems more open, but way too open if you understand my meaning. This location has a separate bar area and dining room. Also, the dining room at the waterfront has way to many lighting fixtures with too many different types of lamp shades, one of the bad decorating choices of the first decade of the twenty-first century. The Settler's Ridge location has three huge acorn shaped chandeliers suspended above the dining room, very chic!

The food is always good, and if you're a practicing vegan like myself, Chang's offers many options. This day I sat at the bar and watched as CNN reported on the death of Osama Bin Laden (USA! USA! Rot in Hell you %#^*#+) and ordered the steamed vegetable dumplings. Six to an order and the perfect light lunch. I also could have ordered the steam \"fried\" brown rice or the famous lettuce wraps made with soy instead of chicken. They also have eggplant and garlic and stringbeans sautéed with garlic. I wasn't a big fan of Chang's until the new location came at Settler's Ridge. But I am now!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed PF Changs in other cities--its one of my favorite chinese places for a laid back evening. I was quite disappointed with the service at this one in Las Vegas. Soup was cold, food did not taste fresh. The look and feel was fine."}
{"text":"I can sum this one up in one word: BLAND.
We got two appetizers and two entrees. The appetizers tasted okay. Crab wontons and egg rolls, I think they were. 
The entrees were BLAND. One of them was a chicken something. I can't remember because it was a few months ago (I have a toddler and am 7 months prego and I am slightly behind in my reviewing duties.) but it had NO flavor to it. They give you several weird sauces, but I am a little leery of mixing sauces into my dish and not knowing how spicy, etc. it is going to come out. But, that entree was BLAH and BLAND. My husband even said \"this has no flavor\" before the words had a chance to come out of my mouth. 
The other thing we ordered was Mongolian beef. It was served with green onions. The dish that came out of the kitchen was COVERED with green onions. We thought it was a plate of green beans, but NO. It was ONIONS. Seriously? They should call it Mongolian Onions flavored with a few pieces of beef. AND, the beef was bland too. (We didn't bother eating the piles of onions.)
Also they sat us at a tiny table near the kitchen. Not too bright considering our kid is in a high chair and in the way of all the servers walking by.
Totally not worth it for the $75 we had to pay. We won't waste our time or money going back there."}
{"text":"I usually love this place! But this time I was very unsatisfied and I'm shocked! I have gotten the WORST service at this location and this is now the closest I live to. When the hostess sat us down at the table our waiter was a little off with us. He was very unprofessional. He wasn't giving eye contact when I was talking to him, he was smirking and making comments under his breath. The food runners were giving me very dirty looks. The people that you may dislike or no longer have in your life may just come into the place that you work. Not to \"stalk\" you but because they like the food and the atmosphere. I got treated very poorly by the coworkers at this establishment. When you have personal business with someone you should leave it at home and not bring it into your work place you shouldn't treat a customer with disrespect. I won't point fingers and say who these food runners are. 

I ordered the most expensive thing on the menu the sea bass and with that I was even unsatisfied. It just had no flavor it was boring, and it made no sense at all to put it on a bed of uncooked spinach. I probably won't come back to this P.F. Chang's."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere.  I highly recommend visiting this restaurant if you are in Vegas.  Best of the best!!

Our waitress Tara was really great!!  Thanks Tara!!"}
{"text":"The waiter came up and greeted me ad if I was a friend by saying \" what's crackin?\" Really?! How is that professionalism. Not only that but my mojito was basically lime juice and water. The worst cocktail I've ever had in my life. Every restraunt I've ever been to the manager stops by to check on guests, I'm guessing the manager either doesn't care or knows how  terrible it is there since I never once saw him go to any table."}
{"text":"OK, I fell off of the wagon and went to a chain restaurant, but only because our friend wanted to fo there for her birthday. I will say that I do like this \"American Chinese\" restaurant. I ordered the Sichuan Scallops and they were very tasty. I like the fact that they serve brown rice. I only waited about 10 minutes to be seated and we had excellent service from Alex. We also had Crispy Honey Chicken and Mongolian Beef at our table. All was good. This is a chain that has NEVER disappointed me, no matter what city."}
{"text":"Food wasn't too tasty. Order the spicy chicken soup which had no favor but hot, the lettuce wrap had old lettuce on the plate, the beef was tough, the salad was soggy and the chicken wasn't cooked thoroughly. Plus the waiter felt a little too comfortable around the table trying to use humor where it was inappropriate. It received a 2 star because the cheesecake and the chocolate mouse was very tasty and that extra scoop of ice cream sealed the deal. Next time I'm ordering just desserts."}
{"text":"Until March 2012, I was not a big PF Changs Fan.  Sure I like the Lettuce Wraps and the Spare Ribs but I have always felt it was overpriced, overcrowded and pretentious.  I tend to avoid places where you have to wait in line for the privilege of dropping a C-note on dinner and drinks for 2 and the food isn't even real chinese.

And then, as if drawn by oriental mystery, I found myself with my lovely wife who is a PF Changs fan hearing myself say  hmm, Lettuce Wraps sound good, surprised it came out of my mouth.  

So off to Rampart we go.  Past the wild rearing horses greeting us and reminding me that this might not be my best choice.  Until.....................

Dinner for 2 for $40.00.  I know I know, many other chains are offering similar or even better priced bargin dinners.  And the old saying you get what you pay for usually holds true.  I thought, ok. It is a trick, small portions, limited menu choices but I will give it a try, for my wife. Well this may be the exception.   The popular items are on the 2 for $40 menu.  Lettuce Wraps, Orange Chicken etc.  Not everything but enough choices to make it worth it.  

You start with soup, we upgrade to the Wonton for some yummy starts.  Then you get 1 appetizer (Lettuce Wraps are a staple.) 2 entrees and either 3 mini deserts or one large piece of cake for a slight upgrade price.

The bowl of soup is huge and we have always ended up taking some home.  The portions appear the same size as the regular dining and of course the same great taste.  The Mongolian Beef is one of our favorites and the Crispy Honey Shrimp and Chicken are awesome.

Unless you are super hungry, there will be enough leftovers for 1-2 lunches.  Make yourself the envy of your lunch crowd at work by enjoying a chinese feast the next day.

I have now become a fan of PF Changs and give them a resounding Xie xie or M goi.  Not to mention the service was fantastic.  We had an amazing server who has been there 7 years.  I hope the restaurant appreciates what they have in this girl.

The only think keeping this from a 5 star rating is that I am from the East Coast where corner store chinese food is better than anything you can find in Vegas and half the price."}
{"text":"We just had the worst experience ever at any restaurant! We waited 20 minutes for the waitress to show at our table. Once she showed we waited for over an hour after placing our order and asked her where was our food? She said it would be at least another 20 minutes because \"they don't have anyone working in the kitchen!\" I asked to please speak with a manager and after 30 more minutes, still no food and no manager. We got up an walked out after 2 hours with no food and only one round of drinks! We saw the mangager on the way out and he was very unapologetic. The worst experience ever with a friend from out of town! This location will be out of business soon and we are very sad about that because it was one of our favorite restaurants and one we frequently visit until today. Very sad!"}
{"text":"It's middle of the road overpriced basic flavored white people Chinese food. I forgot what it was like to come to a Chang's. It's been 10 years for me. Now I know why I didn't miss this place. The service is good enough to be happy but the food is just basic and I'm not used to this fear of flavor style anymore like when I was young and inexperienced in cuisine. Come in for a drink or tea, this are good. Maybe an appetizer if you're hungry but don't expect to have the best food of your life."}
{"text":"Just got home from dinner and had a great time.  I ate too much but it's just because everything was so good.  Alot of great gluten free items avaiable.  Danielle our server was the greatest server I have ever had here.  Danielle please pay it forward and write a positive review for someone in hopes of making another person's day.  Thanks for a great time we will be back and I WILL get that chocolate dome next time."}
{"text":"I kind of have a soft spot for Americanized Chinese food. Dare I say, I enjoy it more than the authentic stuff? I can just imagine my foodie friends shunning me from their presence now.Alright wait but I love me some dim sum so I guess that's not entirely true!

Anyway, I normally would have given PF Changs 3 stars for their good, Americanized spin on Chinese dishes but this review just went up one star because now they have a pre-fixe menu! The price factor was always a deterrent for us but this new menu (hopefully its permanent) is totally worth the price!

For $39 you get soup, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, rice, and a dessert to share. We got the:

* Lettuce wraps- flavorful chicken, scallions, and water chestnuts, this one is always a crowd pleaser. 

*Crispy Honey Chicken- I love this stuff, especially dipped into their hot mustard sauce. Just the right amount or sweetness and crisp from the batter and puffed rice noodles. L.O.V.E. 

*Mongolian Beef- they deep fry the beef I think before they toss it in the sauce. Good but I would definitely rather have authentic for this dish. 

*Soup- we got one of each, hot and sour soup with tofu, chicken and shitake mushrooms and egg drop soup. Although one is tangy while the other is subtle, we liked them both. 

*Tiramisu- I've had so many bad tiramisus at restaurants that I have stopped ordering this. But the hubby really wanted it and I was glad he picked it! Perfect balance of cream and cake with a subtle hint of espresso and rum. Drool. 

I even like the way they cook their brown rice, soft but not mushy. Most places seem to undercook the rice. Its a matter of preference though. I finally asked them what the 3 different sauces are that they mix for your table side. Hot mustard, chili garlic sauce, and \"pot sticker\" sauce. Interesting. But we always enjoy it with our meal. 

We also really like the ambiance here with the dim lighting and decor. Makes for a great date night. But I highly recommend coming later at night (think past 8:30pm) if you want to avoid the crowds and families. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I made reservations earlier today using Yelp for the first time. We arrived ahead of schedule but got seated immediately by a very friendly and complimentary hostess. 

Our waiter was attentive and not overwhelmed by the picky eaters in my family. Chicken lettuce wraps here are a must for an appetizer. If you have more than two eating, you'll need more than one order. 

I usually get crispy honey shrimp but went with shrimp fried rice tonight.  Oh my! There was enough for three servings! It was very tasty...a \"lightly\" fried rice that wasn't greasy. And I ate all three servings LOL"}
{"text":"Just ok. I've been to PF changs plenty of times before and had better experiences. I don't recommend the pad Thai. It was lacking flavor. I feel like they just dumped some peanuts on top of pasta. I might be back to this location but I'm not in a rush."}
{"text":"I've been to P.F. Chang's many times and had better experiences at other locations. I'm not sure if it's the location or just a fluke, but both my dish and my boyfriend's were EXTREMELY salty....I mean I physically winced when eating it. The service was perfectly fine, but too much of a salt assault."}
{"text":"We were a group of five and honestly the food was fair. The large bowl of won ton soup which we shared was luke warm.  When we told the server, he said they can't just \"heat it up\" they would need to make a new bowl. OK....so just take care of it please. He did. I'm a fan of good won ton soup being from a major city and this was a 2 on a scale from 1 to 10 for taste. The food was not memorable and neither was the service. Very nice décor, but the quality and value did not match the nice looking interior. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in looking for some break from the heat after a couple hours shopping.  They have a happy hour menu that we tried several dishes from and all were very good.  Menu also has a good selection of alcoholic drinks nut we stuck to H2O hydration instead.  Staff and management were very attentive.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's Day because it was one of the few restaurants that took reservations and also stayed open late (had reservations for 10:30). The ambiance was lovely. Our server, Ryan, was pretty laid back but still attentive. 

Me and the boyfriend settled on the 2 for $30 which came with an app, 2 entrees, and dessert. The apps took forever to come because the food runner sent them to the wrong table. The entrees came quickly and was served family style so we had shrimp fried rice and some type of chicken and broccoli. I usually hate chicken with glazes and other runny looking stuff on it but it was delicious. The shrimp fried rice that I ordered left much to be desired- I've had better at the mall. We got the sweet treats. Boyfriend got a snickers style treat and I got a salted caramel treat. Dessert was just like any you would get from a chain restaurant- probably taken from the freezer and thrown in the microwave but it was still pretty good.

Overall the ambiance was great, the food didn't blow my socks off but it was still pretty good- I left with a full stomach and plenty of leftovers, and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch last weekend, service was great food was great drinks where delicious BUT why where there so many flys INSIDE the restaurant? Not really understanding how flys got inside..."}
{"text":"We go to this location fairly regularly. Today the food was good, service was actually very good too.  In the past we have had some service issues here. What the unacceptable issue was lack of cleanliness. The dishes were not cleaned properly and we had to ask for replacement. My beer glass had a dead fly on it. There were several fruit flies around our food. The place did not have that many people there around 9 pm on Sunday. Felt like they are slipping on upkeep of the place."}
{"text":"Love the calamari - always done to perfection.  The Northern style ribs are so so so good!  The lettuce wraps with chicken is also really fantastic and fits nicely into my diet!  My cousin loves that a lot of their stuff is gluten-free.  Fantastic for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service! But, you don't eat service. They changed the menu completely! I went for lunch and I was disappointed! The portions are very small and the rice was mushy! The only food are table actually really liked were the lettuce wraps which are really good. It's a shame because I'm normally a big fan and love having lunch there. I may or may not come back."}
{"text":"We ordered $60+ order of food last night for take out. We had a large order because we like leftovers for the weekend. We were eating our meal and my husband noticed something hard that he was chewing on from his chicken fried rice. Spits it out and found that it was a FINGER NAIL. We couldn't believe it. It was so disgusting. We called the manager that night by the name of Nick and he reimbursed us for just that fried rice dish. We should have had the whole meal reimbursed since we just trashed the rest of the order. When you see a finger nail in your food you just can't look past it. Will never order food from them again and you shouldn't either. I wish I can rate it with zero star. Picture is attached."}
{"text":"I normally have to just \"deal with\" the overwhelming savory tastes of PF Chang's, but this location's food is just right! We normally get the Orange Chicken and Mongolian Beef and it was flavored just right, not over-salted. The appetizers came out quickly, the food was delicious, and the service was excellent. Even the front of the house manager was nice enough to check in on us right before dessert. We got to sit outside which provided some great people-watching! Big kudos to the team here at PF Chang's. You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"This was excellent- very very busy - so we sat in the bar area which worked out great.  Apps are awesome - Changs Ribs and Chicken Lettuce wraps - outstanding.  The Mongolian Beef was out of this world."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour! Lettuce wraps $6? Yes!! The BBQ spare ribs are awesome and so are the crispy green beans!! The service was great and they made sure that we got our order in during happy hour. It is a refreshing change compared to some places that seem to discourage the happy hour menu. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I are vegetarians. We love chain restaurants where we know we have standard options... especially when we are too lazy to decide. Ordered our staples today - crispy green beans, mapo tofu and the coconut curry vegetables. Also tried out a new dish today - tempura cauliflower. My husband loved it! It's interesting and I like it enough to gobble a few pieces. Didn't really care for the red sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place! I always get the beef and broccoli. Extra rice and lettuce wraps. Amazing food and the price is great."}
{"text":"I was in the area this past weekend and really thought I need to check out P.F. Chang's, as it has been 10+ years since I have been to one.  
I arrived shortly after 12:00pm on Sunday and was seated in the front area of the restaurant and noticed how clean, open and inviting the restaurant was. I didn't remember liking it years ago, but maybe they have made some changes.  
After being seated I was approached by my server, who was very sweet and took my drink order. After reviewing the menu, with several changes and 'new' items I decided to try a few appetizers/starters to see how things were.  I ordered the egg rolls, wonton soup and the infamous chicken lettuce wraps.

The wonton soup and egg rolls arrived first. The soup was a great. I ordered the cup ,which serves one, and was the perfect size, although next time I will order the bowl, which serves four, so I can take some home as left-overs.  Although I wish they would offer a medium bowl, somewhere in between 1 and 4 servings, ha ha!
The egg rolls were piping hot and filled with a variety of vegetables, carrots, sprouts, etc. and pork. Perfectly cooked with a crisp shell and not too greasy, like some you find at other places.  Although I loved the egg rolls I found the dipping sauce was a little too mustardy for my liking. I actually used some soy sauce, perfection.
The chicken lettuce wraps arrived shortly after and they were piping hot, still steaming.  The dish arrives with a pile of crisp lettuce leafs for wrapping. The dish is a perfect size, for one or for sharing with another appetizer/started and has great flavor. I was not surprised it is one of their signature items.
The menu items I tried were great and the service was on point. Too my surprise I was glad I stopped in and will definitely be back to try one of their meals/entrees."}
{"text":"I'm fairly shocked to be giving P.F. Chang's such a high rating - my understanding has always been that they serve bland Americanized Chinese food - but I really enjoyed my meal here.

We started with Cecilia's Shrimp Dumplings (Served pan-fried or steamed, drizzled with a light chili sauce). I guess the default is steamed because our waiter didn't ask and that's how they arrived. Anyway, they were actually really tasty and the \"light chili sauce\" is quite good (albeit not spicy at all).

For our main, we went with the Street Noodles (Thin rice noodles, light curry sauce, shrimp, chicken, julienned veggies). Again, I was very, very impressed with the food. Although it was also lacking in spice, the dish contained a number of flavors that worked really well together and I should also mention that the shrimp was plentiful.

We also got a special Mai Tai for two in a Tiki glass and this thing was *enormous*. The glass is about the size of a small child's head and whoever made the drink used a very heavy hand with the booze. It was pretty great."}
{"text":"Was disappointed with service today for lunch. Was notified that their rice needed a little bit longer to cook..so we waited 30 minutes for the rice to cook..finally our server came up to us and she stated that the rice was done and they were in the process of rolling 12 sushi rolls so it shouldn't be to much longer. 20 minutes later she comes by to let us know the rice is not sticking so we wouldn't be getting our sushi. I'm not sure how a restaurant that has such a wide variety of sushi rolls is unable to serve sushi to their guests."}
{"text":"Based on one visit with friends, I found the food and service at this PF Chang's to be consistent with other PF Chang's restaurants.

My favorites are the \"Double Pan-Fried Noodles,\" Sweet and Sour Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and the Spare Ribs.

Plate prices are generally less than $15 each. Portions are average sized.

Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Waited for 45 minutes on a weeknight before we got our table. Table view was amazing on the second floor but that was the only thing amazing during that night. Dynamite Shrimp had no kick at all, Dandan Noodles were soggy, Mongolian Beef was overcooked and chewy and our Calamari appetizer came AFTER our entrees were served. Our server was really efficient though, refilling our waters on point and following up on our calamari. But if i wanted asian/chinese food, i wouldn't go back to PF Changs."}
{"text":"My mother and I ordered the Chang for two four course dinner. It was the perfect amount of food for the both of us with no leftovers. Our waiter Russell was super attentive! My only complaint is that the description of pad Thai in the menu didn't list that it contained egg. It mentioned having tofu, but not egg. (It contained egg...)"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Never ceases to amaze in service or taste of food. The meal for 2 is the best price ever. My husband and 2 kids all share it and there was food left over. Great price!!"}
{"text":"Heard all the raving about this place, and I have to say the food is pretty good.  The portions based on the money you pay, however, could be a little more.  The service was OK, too.  Just wasn't overly impressed, but may just be personal preference.  Can't say they did anything \"wrong.\""}
{"text":"I guess I don't get all the fuss about this place. Went about 3Pm on  Saturday afternoon. Not crowded at all. Service was great.
Started with the crab wantons. Was very good. The home made wan ton sauce was to die for. Then went on to the egg drop soup. Again, a wonderful choice. It was outstanding. I ordered the mongolia beef and upgraded to fried rice for $1 extra. The fried rice was nothing remarkable. Just so-so. The mongolian beef was worthless. It was nothing. The onions added nothing. It was very disappointing.
The extras were all good but the main entree dropped the ball. Service was very good. Overall rating, not worth the high $$. Even Panda Express's beef is better."}
{"text":"Food always takes a long time to get served. The only things I order when I come here are hot & sour soup, lettuce wraps & Kung Pao scallops. Last time I tried couple different dishes & they weren't very good such as shrimps in lobster sauce. So I better stick to what I like. Lol! I also like that kids have healthy choices rather than just chicken fingers, mac & cheese, etc. at most of the restaurants."}
{"text":"My experience was like the others posted here.  Went to the Mesa location for the first time Saturday night.  Haven't really had the urge for Changs but I had a gift card to use.  Sit down... notice how small the restaruant is compared to the other Changs, weird.  And they sat us at the little two-seater in the middle of the room, I hate that! Anyway, about 10 mins later, no server in sight, the manager asked if we have had our drink order taken.  We hadn't, so he took it, by that point we were ready to order and he took that too.  He did apologize for the tardy introduction from our server.  I used to be a server at the Chandler Changs so I know what standards this restaruant holds and let me tell you this location doesn't hold up to them.  The table had food particles left on it.  The chili, soy and vinegar bottles had residue on them.  Hot water and hand soap cleans this up real nice, when I worked there we had to have clean bottles on our table!  Our server comes by with our drinks sets them down and walks away.  Didn't even introduce herself, we didn't know if she was our server or not.  Few minutes later she comes back and drops off the \"sauce\" and mixes it quickly and explains that by adding more chili sauce it will make it hotter.... that was it!  You are supposed to explain what the sauce is and ask your guests how hot they want the sauce and explain what all the sauces mean.  Or by all means ask them if they have ever been to the restaurant before and by chance you won't have to explain it because your guests already know what it is.  She was lacking on the communication.  Food comes, just okay.  Not the taste I remember from my days of working there which is why I rarely go to Changs anymore.  Very pricing.  Kung Pao Scallops were $17.95, they used to be $12.95, Wow!  Crab fried rice was not to my liking.  The \"server assistant\" or busser (whatever they are called nowdays) refilled our drinks but not quickly.  He brought us new ones from the kitchen instead of refilling them with the pitcher (it was ice tea) not sure why... but it took forever. Won't bother with this place again."}
{"text":"This is a great P.F. Chang's.  Besides the normal great chinese food they have, the staff here was very accomodating.  They even let me ride the horse! (See attached pic)."}
{"text":"Uuuugh. The BF went and picked up food from PF changs tonight because we had a gift card and I still can't go out due to coldy fluish yuck disease.... wtf, I can't shake it. So I got wonton soup (for the throat), the BF got sweet and sour chicken and we shared some dumplings. The soup was so bland.... possibly the most bland wonton soup I have ever tried. The BF thought the sweet and sour chicken was alright.... but the menu says it is pan fried and the chicken is clearly deep fried... yuck. Also, They really don't give you a very large portion for what you pay.... most places I can eat the food for at least two days on what they give you, but the BF finished all maybe 10 pieces of chicken that were on his dish.  I would never pay to eat at this restaurant. Their food is so ridiculously bad for you and expensive. Their double pan fried noodles have just about a full day's worth of sodium and calories... ugh. I do not understand how the PF Changs all stay in business.... they're just not good. I had better chinese food yesterday and the entrees cost 5$...."}
{"text":"Ok, I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt by visiting it a second time, after my first experience here a few months back, which was dreadful and ended up in a complimentary dinner for my 2 friends and I, even though, all I really got a hold of to consume that evening was the drink that I ordered and not my meal. 

Firstly, I was sat kind of in the same general area which I'm just going to dub the slow as hell corner. Last time when I sat in this area, I didn't see my food until and hour after I ordered it, and by then my friend had sent it back in frustration of the wait. This time, it was the same extremely long wait, its like they can get out appetizers and small quick meals, but obviously entrees are a bit more time consuming than that, but an HOUR wait, in between, and there was like 5 tables of people in the entire restaurant, total that afternoon, and then for it to taste mediocre...come on P.F. Chang people!!

The waitress this time was nice, so I made sure she got a good tip, it wasn't her job to make the food so I wasn't blaming her on the untimeliness of it all. However, the waiter I had at the prior visit, spilled water on all of us and didn't even apologize or have someone to come clean it up, I'm like are you serious?!!

The manager of the place is pretty accommodating and apologetic, as he comped our first meal. Although, I didn't see too much of him during my second visit. Otherwise I would have so complained...normally I just grin and bear bad service and talk crap later, but now I'm learning that an unpleasant dining experience is something to say something about, and not after you've left!"}
{"text":"Absolutely AWFUL service. 
We were originally told a wait time of 40 minutes, and this progressively grew throughout our wait. So after about 45 minutes of waiting, we asked again how much longer of a wait. At this point, we were told it would be about another fifteen minutes. 25 minutes after THAT, we asked again and were told it would be another 10-15 minutes. 
At this point, people that were JUST walking through the door were being told they had a 15 minute wait.... 
WAIT GUESS: 40 min
WAIT TOTAL: about an hour and a half

On top of this, the lady who was at the front desk should not be a front of house person, on top of having seriously bad time guessing skills (which is part of her job), she had horrid customer service skills.  

The only positive was our waitress. She was great, very attentive!

While I am usually a PF Changs fan, I would NEVER give my hard earned money to this poorly run establishment."}
{"text":"We had a five star meal with 10 star service from Ali!  We happened to score a free appetizer of sticky ribs right off the bat and everything got better from there. Ali allowed us to sip our cocktails leisurely and checked in just when we needed to order more food. We paired the ribs with a California Roll. Next a sizzling plate of Kung Pao Chicken accompanied with Long Life Prawns. Yesssss!  The prawns were huge and crispy paired with spicy noodles. Mmmm!  Ali made sure we didn't go away without surprising us with Banana Wontons and the most decadent chocolate cake ever!  We had to take half of it home to eat the next day. We had a rough day ahead of us and Ali made sure we were full of love and great food to sustain us!  Thank you Ali!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day, was my first time and I ordered the shrimp tempura bowl and it was amazing! I can't believe I've never come here before. Our waiter was awesome and attentive, really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for happy hour on our way to a movie. We went straight to the bar. Been here about 5 times in the last 6 months or so, always for HH and have never been greeted by the hostesses. It's funny too, because there is always 2 of them standing there, usually talking to each other. Last night I commented, oh yeah, the service here sucks. Oh well, we continued to the bar and found a seat. It was about 5:30. Happy hour ends at 6:00 so we had plenty of time to get an order in. We sat for a few minutes and still not acknowledged so the husband went back to the hostesses and picked up a menu from their station, while they were standing there. The waiter we had, however, was very prompt to take our order and bring the food and check on us several times. He gets 5 stars for his service. For the food: it's always consistently on the money. And the HH deals are great. We get the lettuce wraps (my fave), spring rolls, the ribs with the dry rub (they are fantastic), dumplings and the green beans.  Everything is fresh and tasty. After the meal, we left, walking right by the hostess station without a peep from either one of them. I really wonder if they are trained that way because I've never seen them any other way. If not for the hostesses, I would give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"This PF Changs is like any other PF Changs.  The food is average (not bad, just average).  The service is also chain-restaurant average.  If anything, order the spring rolls and a beer for an app, then head somewhere else for dinner.  Even the edamame was boring and soggy."}
{"text":"We visit this Chang's every time we come to Vegas and have always had great food and great service.  When the wait is long, we have also been able to sit at the bar and get full menu service.  The shrimp in lobster sauce is awesome and the chicken lettuce wraps are great.  I don't eat spicy food but my husband got the kung pao scallops this past time and even my wimpy self could handle them and they were great.  Also, the oo-long tea (spelling?) is a good hot tea that doesn't even seem to need to be sweetened.  The servers are very knowledgeable about their menu and always attentive.  Kids get crayons and Wiki Stix to keep them busy.  Apparently the large wall mural above the bar is different at every location, ask your server about the one here...you'll never guess what it represents....."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Saturday night. The wait was about 25 mins and that's why I gave 4 stars. The food was really good. We ordered the lettuce wraps chicken. So fresh and satisfying. The entrees we ordered were Chang's spicy chicken which wasn't spicy but had a good kick of flavor. Sesame chicken I really didn't care for. It wasn't like traditional sesame chicken I'm used to..it was still good tho. Lastly we ordered the lo menu combo. $3 for combo and we got all this chicken but only 4 shrimps and like 3 pieces of steak. Rip off. The noodles were good tho. Service was great no complaints."}
{"text":"This P.F. Chang's location is a good step up from the rest of their chain. 

I love the open floorplan and warm lighting; it was very modern, but still cozy. I've taken my bf here for an impromptu date night, and a group of drinking buddies- it works equally well for both.

The service was extraordinary. I usually avoid P.F. Chang's because the waitstaff can be a little clingy, but there was a good balance here. He was very knowledgable and eager to help, but knew when to let us enjoy our meal. Drinks were refilled before they were finished.

The food was a nice upgrade from their normal fare. Perhaps they're renovating all their locations, but the emphasis was on fresher tastes and less syrupy-sweet sauces. The seared tuna was great, though the green tea soba noodles were inedible. The chicken lettuce wrap was good, as always. The moo shu chicken was okay when it was hot, though lost it's appeal quickly. The kitchen wasn't able to get our meals out at exactly the same time, so they comped the meal. 

The bar service was nice. Just nice. I wouldn't go here to drink, though there seemed to be a few who were doing just that.

On weekends, there can be up to a 45-minute wait for a table; with that kind of wait, you may as well just go to into town."}
{"text":"The food is good, but wow, do they not check their dishes before they go out. We were there last night and every single utensil and plate they brought out was dirty. The forks and knives were smudged and gross, and the residue came off when rubbed with a finger. The plates had spots on them, little black ones like pepper. This has happened here before, too. I'm shocked the waitstaff doesn't at least look at these plates/utensils before bringing them out to customers.
Secondly, they really need to do something about the big round table closest to the front door. In the winter, people are constantly coming in through the revolving door, which blasts that table with cold air. Often, the door doesn't shut all the way, and we were so cold, we had to eat with our coats on! I did see space heaters near the entrance, but it didn't help. They should not seat people there in winter if they can't fix this issue, it was that cold."}
{"text":"So, in case you didn't know, P.F. Chang's is a chain restaurant. It is convenient for me because of the location, and the restaurant has always been clean and well-maintained. But again, this is a chain restaurant. Nothing to write home about, as some would say, but I have been to far worse Chinese restaurants in town, so....

I appreciate the new menu. Some of the items (I'm looking at you Hong Kong Seabass) are rather pricey for the portions, but are quite good! I especially love the crispy honey chicken, the Hong Kong Seabass (sign up for the rewards program, and then try it when you have a free entree!), the crispy green bean appetizer, and the salt and pepper calamari appetizer. I would pick those four items as my hands-down favorites. 

The staff here have always been pleasant, and whenever an issue has come up, it has been addressed and taken care of promptly. I appreciate the effort that the staff here put into making your experience a positive one."}
{"text":"So yesterday, 3/16/11, my best friend's roommate, Lawrence T. asked me out; unsure of where we should go for the meal part, I suggested \"the Chinese restaurant by your house.\" I meant the Pearl Wok To Go http://www.yelp.com/biz/pearl-wok-to-go-las-vegas#hrid:jcxX6SDXMY-AXrGCElXEYQ (which I had back on Christmas Eve.) While driving around I spotted it and he said, \"really? I wanted to take you to a real restaurant, not fast food. Let's just go to P.F. Chang's.\" 

Anyway, we head on over and walk right in. It was stuffy and loud inside so we jumped at the opportunity to sit out on the patio. It was nice outside and the weather was gorgeous. There was a little boy that spent the entire time dancing and jumping around an empty table and waiving at cars. That was pretty entertaining. 

We ordered - he had orange peel chicken and an iced tea, I had Mongolian beef... but with lamb instead, with extra chili pods, and water. The orange peel chicken was just okay, and my dish came with a canapy of green onions and not too much meat, although it was delicious. The \"mild sauce\" that our waitress, Ashley, made was, according to Lawrence, \"tasteless.\" Ashley was a little... eh. My water glass was empty most of the meal, and that drives me crazy. 

For $35 + $10 tip, the food is just not worth the price. PF Chang's has definitely gone down hill. Although I had a great time with Lawrence, we could have had just as good a time at a cheaper restaurant."}
{"text":"Because of the heat in Vegas and because of our pure laziness, we had PF Chang's twice - while staying at the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino. We ordered it togo one of the days and the other day we ordered it through the hotel's room service. It's seriously the perfect meal when you want decent food and it's pretty yummy. 

I have eaten at many PF Chang's - one of my bestie's used to manage one - so I know the menu pretty well. But this time I tried some different foods and now have new faves. I really enjoyed the Dan Dan Noodles - spicy and similar to Pad Thai - soba noodles served with sprouts and goodness, Crab Wontons and the Combination Lo Mein. Good times!

We managed to order way too much food and had two meals with one order :) The restaurant itself gets packed since it's right on the strip so if you're staying at PH, go ahead and order to go and enjoy your american style chinese food. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great place. Food and service was great. Hand a very nice time with mt dear friend and sisters."}
{"text":"The dragon roll was delicious and our server was very good, that's only why I gave a two star. Unfortunately that was it. The rest of the dinner was a complete waste. Pad Thai, so fishy it made me gag, the kung pao shrimp was almost ok and the sauces were nothing to write home about. Sorry but we just wasted our last dinner in AZ at this place."}
{"text":"Good place to go. I like it. 

Nothing really stood out this time, nor was anything \"bad\". 

This was a very uneventful experience, which is not a bad thing. It was as expected. Good food. Nice place. Great area."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying I love P F Changs, so much in fact that I ate at this location twice while in Tempe for a five day stay. 

Day 1 (Five star review)
Two days before valentines day. The server, Jennifer, was excellent she didn't miss a thing. Drinks were always full, good recommendation from the menu, and overall good personality. I had changs spare ribs to start and shaking beef for dinner. It was great, no complaints. everything came out as you would hope when going out to a restaurant.

Day 2 (1 star review)
The day after valentines day. We went in looking to sit in Jennifer's section, but she wasn't there. The server we got instead took our appetizer order and suggested the hunan hot fish as my main entree. I had never had the hot fish and was excited to try it out. After waiting about 10 minutes our appetizer, came out. The appetizer was the spare ribs, they usually come with a salty cinnamon mix that you put on the ribs. this time it was like someone forgot the salt and it was almost all cinnamon. not bad, just not as good as usual. After waiting another few minutes we asked our server what was delaying the entrees. He went to check and the manager came out to advise they were out of the fish. 

I can't imagine how embarrassing it would be to recommend a dish only to find out the kitchen had ran out. Part of the mangers job is to make sure the wait staff is equipped with that type of information.

Anyway, I ordered a different dish and it came out pretty quick, but they forgot about the spicy green beans we had ordered. On top of that, in the confusion of getting the fish thing sorted out, our drinks had run dry. 

The two upsides to the meal is that everything came out tasting good and the manager gave us the green beans for free."}
{"text":"Okay, so I finally went to P.F. Chang's and I'd have to say it was alright.  We went there for a work function so the bill was not something I had to worry about!  Which was uber nice because I tried a few things that I normally wouldn't buy myself. So here is a run down of what I had:

Appetizer: Tuna Tataki Crisp $9.95 *****
~ This was very good! I am a sushi fanatic, so I really enjoyed this dish. It was Ahi tuna rare on a crispy wonton-topped with ahi, cucumber, and scallions in a citrus sesame soy sauce. It was very fresh! I feel it could have used a tad more on the citrus sesame soy sauce but other than that, fabulous!

Appetizer: Lettuce Wraps $7.95 *
~  I can honestly say that these wraps were not what I expected.  With all the hype I thought these were gonna blow my taste buds to smithereens! They did no such thing.  They were \"okay\" at best.  Not a lot of flavor in the meat filling at all. Will not be getting these again.

Dinner: Oolong Marinated Chilean Sea Bass $24.95 ****
~  This FISH was amazing! It was served in a ginger soy type broth with spinach.  While the fish was extraordinary, I felt there was way too much broth and it just made my spinach way to soggy and a bit on the salty side.  It would have been a 5 star dish with less of the broth.

Desert: Mudslide Cocktail $9.00 *****
~ This deserved 5 stars! It was very yummy and it's alcohol! Win win! 

While I enjoy the food, I felt it to be a bit over priced.  The wait staff was super nice and you never had to \"search\" for anyone.  Would I go here again? If it were another work function, yes.  Otherwise, probably not."}
{"text":"*Customer Service 2/2 Stars, This is by far one of my favorite places to eat and when you go here you're going to get good customer service. 

*Experience 1/1 Star, I have yet to go here and have a bad experience, the atmosphere is great and don't have anything negative to say here. 

*Food 1/1 Star, Food is always top of the line and my personal favorite dish is the Kung Pao Chicken Recommend trying it if you haven't already! 

*Would I Recommend 1/1 Star, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone I know as you will have a good time and enjoy some amazing food as well."}
{"text":"We have been here several times in the past. This experience was a little less pleasurable. We were greeted and immediately seated. We ordered drinks. Should it take 10 minutes to get a soda and beer? We ordered the P.F. Chang's for two. So we waited another 10 minutes to get the soup and appetizer. The main course was up 25 minutes after we ordered. The food was super as always. We ordered dessert and I ordered another beer. When they brought the dessert I mentioned to my wife \"I hope they don't charge me for the second beer because I didn't get it\". The waitress overheard me and got it immediately. 
   The portions were large as I needed a to go box. The dessert was very decadent and rich. There was rock and roll music in the background which took away from the ambiance. Somewhere during the meal a waitress dropped a tray of food or dishes which made a huge racket. 
    The manager happened by sometime before we left and I mentioned that this place wasn't rated that great on Yelp. He said \"I read those things and laugh\".
   We come here about once a year for special occasions. The food is what we like and are willing the put up with the slow service and lack of ambiance."}
{"text":"WOW. BEST. SERVICE. AND. SERVER. EVER.

let me just say CHRIS was just AMAZING i wish i can present him award for being the best server ever! he was friendly, attentive, and just awesome. it's very rare to come across such great service. my boyfriend and i ordered shaking beef and we asked for extra onions and chris gave us a whole PLATE! we were soo amazed on how much they gave! we also ordered the scallop/ shrimp kung pao plate and loved every bite. he even brought me out a birthday cheesecake because he knew it was my 21st! i would come back just for chris as well as the food. chris is you're reading this thank you for your service and the great time."}
{"text":"We were given a $50 gift card for Christmas, if not we would not have walked in here on our own accord. It's hard not to be overly critical as a Chinese person, but this is quite simply overpriced Asian fusion. The miso-glazed salmon was okay, Buddha's feast was fine, lobster and shrimp fried rice was tasty and the only saving grace. I've never been to any other location, but the service was reeeeeally slow for a Thursday night, so that was kind of frustrating. Our food was also only warm, not hot. It's alright, but we won't be returning when there's an Asiatown full of delicious Chinese food so close by."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the patio setting.  Great food, excellent service... management is great!  I cannot say enough about this restaurant.  AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Ok- we go here regularly. When we eat in- house, the problems aren't that bad. When we order take out, I can't even say enough cuss words.  Wrong meals, no chops sticks, no soy sauce, i can go on and on. 

Tonight's disaster: no broccolini . No big deal. But I don't want broccoli instead. Then, making me wait 25 minutes for the rest of my order to be done (1 order of dumplings) makes everything cold and soggy.  An hour later, my husband is still not home. 

I hate take out. Btw- they forgot my sauces."}
{"text":"Same great food, different location. Gave it an extra star cuz I was on vacation."}
{"text":"We sat down for a 4pm dinner in a nearly empty restaurant. 

25min later the three new tables that arrive already have their food.

4:25pm: Our appetizer we ordered never came and we got our food. So we said skip the app. 

My Chang's spicy chicken had shrimp in it. 

I called the manager over and told her my chicken meal has shrimp and that this isn't acceptable I have an allergy. 

She had the audacity to ask if I told the waiter about my allergy... why would I need to announce any seafood allergy when I ORDERED chicken? She said they would remove the meal from the check.

The check came and guess what, all items were on it. 

So now yet again we have to bring something up because they don't know how to communicate there. 

Also apparently the white rice and brown rice is mixed in the same bowl when two entrees are ordered that want different rice!? I mean forget the customer and getting what they want! Especially at $17 a plate for rice and chicken (and the occasional shrimp) 

This place doesn't treat you like a customer it treats you like an inconvenience. 

The manager had absolutely no customer service etiquette."}
{"text":"I'm so impressed. I just had probably one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had. Every thing was perfect. Great service.. Whole staff was energetic and friendly, food was amazing, beer was perfectly cold. The male manager absolutely knows what he's doing and deserves a raise. I work a lot and this was the first time I've had a night off...
Well spent. I will absolutely come back."}
{"text":"My friend's 18th birthday dinner was supposed to be at P.F. Chang's tonight. She made the reservation many days ago and when we got there they said another party was put in place of our reservation. They then proceeded to say they wouldn't seat us until 2 hours later, even though there was plenty of room and we didn't mind if we sat outside. Awful customer service. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"DO NOT order the sushi from the appetizer menu. It was awful.
There service was excellent and the other food was above average."}
{"text":"I'm another one of those people who really likes PF Changs. This location in particular is fabulous. The manager (who I swear to God is Stanley Tucci's twin -- which won over my Devil Wears Prada loving heart -- he even did an impression for me that made my night!), the waiters are fun, and go a great job. And even though Mill Avenue is dead and gone - it's nice to be down by ASU and see that some places are doing well. I'm crossing my fingers for the day that Mill is revitalized and the streets are lined with people like they used to be!

Try: Ginger Chicken, Orange Chicken & Chicken Lettuce Wraps"}
{"text":"It was okay I've been there before in California. I think this 1 is a little different for me sometimes depends on the location but I didn't really enjoy it Planet Hollywood. Get customer service but other than that I didn't really enjoy the food there. If it is a next time maybe I should try the 1 in Green Valley."}
{"text":"Awesome food. They made sure we could get vegetarian option. 
Server Ivan and the manger were really good"}
{"text":"I have celiac disease so most Chinese food is off limits.  I am so thankful for P.F. CHANG's.  They have a dedicated gluten free menu with safe kitchen practices and trained staff-yes!

I often go for the Mongolian beef, because I can't deny its salty sweetness.  Most recently I got the peppered beef which I found a bit watery and I didn't prefer it's flavors.  I also got the chocolate dome which I haven't gotten in ten years and I absolutely favored it.  It is decadent, rich, balanced with berries, and chocolatey-a dessert success.

I love going here for he lunch deal-makes the prices much more reasonable and it's not as busy. Waiters are always attentive and I always leave happy with my meal."}
{"text":"If you've been to one P.F. Chang's, you've been to them all.  Slightly overly helpful wait staff, an Americanized Chinese menu, and above average food quality.   When you're doing a business lunch in Henderson, you can definitely do a lot worse."}
{"text":"Decent Americanized Chinese food (lots of sugar).  I like the lettuce wraps, eggplant dish, stir fries and seafood dishes.  Heavy on soy and chile sauces.  Nice bar and drink menu.  Light on pours.  Ambiance is fun and service is well executed.  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Eh. What a complete letdown. And honestly, waste of money.

First things first, the positives. The service was great. Our server was super nice and patient with us. The owner (I'm assuming) went around the restaurant, making sure everyone was happy and was served. The space itself was nice and spacious.

Aaand on to the not so good. Mainly the food. I wasn't expecting authentic Chinese food, but you know, at least decent food. This was not decent. The family and I got: calamari, Singaporean street noodles, Buddha's Feast, and the Chino-Latino Pineapple pork. The calamari was alright, bland and wasn't crispy. The sauce it came with didn't compliment the calamari at all. It almost overpowered it. The Singaporean noodles had potential, but it was wayy too salty. I ordered the Buddha's Feast, expecting it to be like a Buddha's delight sort of thing: veggies with brown sauce. What I got: steamed vegetables with some pieces of tofu. NO SAUCE. Like, wtf? I wouldn't have gotten that if I knew I was only getting steamed vegetables. I just doused it with some soy sauce because I needed some kind of flavor. The Chino-Latino pineapple pork wasn't bad at all actually. It the pork was a bit crisp, and the pineapple salsa ish topping was good. Also, my sister ordered this coconut refresher (can't remember the exact name) and it was just like coconut milk out of the can with a shitton of sugar. Not good.

With the quality of the food being not good, the price they charge is not worth it. At all. You're pretty much paying for the ~ambiance~. All four of us were disappointed by the end of the meal, and it was a consensus that we could get much better Chinese food at any Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. My brother even said that Panda Express food is better. And I agreed. It was that bad.

So overall, not good, not worth it, just go to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Why does it take so long to eat here?  Every time I come the service is super slow that I regret it. There was 1 server for too many tables. I've tried coming during the week and on weekends but won't be back. Food is just ok. Pei Wei is so much better."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday weekend in Vegas. We had a great time. The wait was about 45 minutes but it went by pretty fast since we were able to gamble while waiting. We ordered the honey chicken, egg drop soup, mongolian beef, and double pan friend noodles. Everything was great. They didnt sing happy birthday but they brought over a small dessert with a lit candle. It was really rich chocolate cake with some kind of raspberry bottom and chocolate frosting and chocolate chips on top."}
{"text":"Okay food. Just horrible service

Went at a very slow time. Only several tables in whole place. 

Ordered appetizers and server just so unattentive. We sat for 25 minutes finally he brings apps and another server brings out our meal. So sick of poor service. 

We waited and waited for bill then another 10 minutes to check out. There were 5 waitstaff and 10 tables. Shouldn't be that hard.  Just go to a real Chinese restaurant and get good food and service.

Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I recommend reservating or  tipping was a big line feel sorry for the low ballers"}
{"text":"On a coworker's suggestion, three of us visited for lunch. For 12:30 on a weekday, the place was barely a third filled. The three hostesses were clearly underworked trying to organize the few customers into tables.

PF Chang's has a special lunch menu if you want to save a few bucks. I had the Almond and Cashew Chicken with brown rice. The $10 meal comes with a bowl of egg drop or hot & sour soup. There was plenty of chicken (not fried! yay!) and a large serving of rice - enough to take half of the meal home in a nice container. The sauce was very flavorful, though it seemed to be a little light on both the almonds and the cashews.

One friend ordered the Combination Lo-Mein from the main menu and was very satisfied. He said that there was plenty of beef, chicken and shrimp in there.

The waiter was attentive without being overbearing. He mentioned that each of the staff has their own recipe for the condiments, preparing his own recipe in front of us. If you ask me, it seemed a little silly, but it's part of the charm that is PF Chang's. After the meal, he brought over the dessert tray. The cheesecake and mini-cheesecakes looked good, as did the six-layer chocolate cake that must have been the size of a small football. We declined.

Good service, good food, a decent price for a lunch meal."}
{"text":"LET'S FACE IT..!
If you want your anniversary or your birthday to be ruin, by the bad customer service, you can gladly come to pf.changs, they will go out of their way to make sure you get the worst service you can find now in days..!
5 minutes after lettuce wraps were placed on the table, main course was brought, i said, \"can you hold it, as we are still eating\"
she said \"5 minutes is ok??\"
Are you kidding me..??
I was about to explode 
Never felt so rushed and limited
My wife took it nicely and said \"let's race\"
NO check back 
NO drink up sell
NO special given 
NO recommendations 
NO good 
Portions for the buck are way to small, (rather go to PANDA EXPRESS,
oh, their Kum-pao chicken is to kill for)
Two stars  because waitress was a bit sympathetic so, no name neither,
but ticket number only for training and counseling #50042
Two stars for good flavor, but stingy portions and pricey menu..!!!
They have the highest check average for Chinese food on the market, so be aware, you've been warned..!!!"}
{"text":"I am rarely as disappointed as I am with this sad imitation Chinese food chain restaurant. Boo. Even if your personal taste doesn't extend to authentic cuisine, go anywhere else. The service is actually worse than the food. Tried to get some quick 'To-Go' stir fry veggies and an apple crumble dessert. Their website forbids simple customization which should have been my first clue that I was making a mistake. I placed my order and typed my 'DAIRY FREE' indication in the place of my 'Pick-Up' name. Apparently that was not clear enough. Order wrong, good cold, they didn't honor the coupon they emailed the same day. In a recap, Go to China One instead. They are right up the street."}
{"text":"Had the prawns and noodles with brown rice food was excellent prawns were big moist and juicy wonderful atmosphere"}
{"text":"Had a excellent dinner ribs, lettuce wraps and lobster and schrimp fried rice. Love this location over the green valley ranch location. Excellent service"}
{"text":"We went here last month and the service sucks! First they said 30mins for indoor sitting but we ended up sitting outside with 30 mins wait, but they promised a 15 mins wait. Then when utensils came they served us with a broken glass and a dirty plate. I know these things happen but they did not even apologize for it. Super bad customer service! Plus the quality of so called authentic chinese food is not even authentic, super bland! Panda express is even better. I do not recommend this place at all!!!!"}
{"text":"The Korean Chicken and their new Mandarin Crunch Salad were great. I was very happy with my visit!"}
{"text":"PF Changs has delicious food in a quiet beautiful place. The lettuce wraps are succulent and not too salty. The salmon and orange chicken were fantastic. Our waiters were knowledgeable and gave good suggestions to help us 4 girls order the right amounts. I'm so glad we came to PF Changs."}
{"text":"Service was very good.  Or server was attentive to our needs and made sure everything came our on time.  

Food was reasonably priced and very good.  The lobster shrimp rice had a little too much rice and barely any shrimp.  It tasted awesome.  
My daughters food was spot on..... can't remember what she ordered though.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Chinese so I stopped in for lunch. I was greeted by the bartender, Roger. Not only was he friendly and attentive, he was approachable and professional. It happened to be Birthday and he took such good care of me! ...After so many years I would still highly rate this location."}
{"text":"Our party all had different items which were great. The sesame chicken and general Tso's chicken was our favorite.  Clean place, GREAT service and great food."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! Started out with our table not set up. Ordered 3 entres and 2 arrived at the table within reasonable time, the third didn't come for another 15  mins. Ordered ginger chikcken and broccoli; could not taste a hint of ginger and the broccoli was raw. Asked for napkins and server brought cocktail napkins! Had to request silverware and linen napkins which should have been set on table before sitting. Server took my empty wine glass and didn't ask if he could bring another. Had to flag down a server to request another glass of wine. Kitchen was backed up and this was a Wed night! Very disappointing dining experience!"}
{"text":"I don't care if this place is a chain  or serves americanized (aka not real) chinese food...i LOVE it!  PF Chang's is a little pricey for Chinese food, but hey...it tastes good!  Dishes are approximately $9-$14 (according to my memory).  I always order the dan dan noodles.  This is by far the best dish they have!  The mushu pork is also pretty tasty and the servers even put the pancake and pork together for you!  Now that's service! something you NEVER get in an authentic Chinese restaurant!  Also, every meat dish comes with rice!  (major points because Americanized Chinese places usually charge rice per person...lame!)"}
{"text":"This was my second visit in 3 weeks. It will be my last for a bit. Parking lot and area around the restaurant is dirty. Real appetizing overflowing trash (see pic - where did all that gum come from?), cigarette but, metsl pipes against the bldg, etc. Inside the booths are worn and shabby. For the price, pass."}
{"text":"The Summerlin location is always consistently great. Service is friendly, food is prepared same way and also very good and consistant. Had the walnut melon shrimp, hot n sour soup ..yummo tasty and filling. Also had the lettuce wraps of course. Recommend this location in town, the others are a tourists trap.."}
{"text":"Worse service EVER.  Manager was very kind but we were so disappointed in the service nothing could of made it better. First we sat down and no one even acknowledged us for at least 10 minutes.  Manager finally asked is we wanted a drink - then the waiter came over kind of rushed us along.  I used to think PF Chang's had the best service ever. No more"}
{"text":"I visited here for my birthday with family and it was just okay. I was excited to finally make it here but it was just okay. I had the Surf and Turf which actually looked bigger on the picture. When I finally got my plate the lobster tail was so small I could not believe  that it even came in that size it must've been a baby lobster, I was very disappointed. We also actually got the chicken hand rolled egg rolls and brown rice also which was just okay. The ambience and the lighting were great but the quality of food for the price was not. The children's plate consisted of about 8 pieces of chicken just fried in batter and a choice of mixed fruits. After visiting I can say I tried it once but not sure if I would return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is ruining my favorite dish a little at a time. The wanton soup 4 years ago was great. BIG jumbo shrimp. Then smaller shrimp. Last week it looked like tiny tiney canned shrimp. So disappointing. Please, charge me more if you need to and bring the quality back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch menu
It's fast, lite, and really delicious. Cucumber Collins is refreshing and not overpowering for mid day.:-)
Beef n broccoli and pepper steak are lite in calories too"}
{"text":"In Charlotte, NC, this is your safe choice.  You can't go wrong with P.F. Chang's.  As a native Chinese, would I miss their food because they remind me of home, or would I miss any of their dishes that lead to constant urges of repeat visits, the answer is probably \"no\".   This is your go to place for business lunch, or just some causal Asian bistro on the weekend, like a bunch deal or something like that.  The only thing worth mentioning is their cabbage wrap, the way they prep it is not authentic Chinese, but it is a good dish choice for those wanting to sound like they know and appreciate Chinese food!! They cater to those with food allergies, so if you have glutton disease or faint due to over consumption of MSG, check them off of your order list! ;)"}
{"text":"Love the special dishes here.  Always good and fresh and service is great!  Try the Cantonese lemon chicken. ..so good!"}
{"text":"I don't quite understand all of the the negative reviews on here. I understand each experience is different but I have eaten at PF many times and it's always consistant and good. Is it a $$$$ Celebrity Chef owned restaurant on the strip? No but the food is good with good value and the service is fantastic. We had the Flaming Red Wontons, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Salt and Pepper Prawns, S&S Pork and Sizzling Asparagus. I asked about the SP Prawns before I ordered them and the server gave me a quick description and said they were really good. She was right! They were excellent, perfectly prepared and tasty. She recommend the Flaming Wontons again nice dish with a kick to it. My wife only had one because of the extra kick but hey more for me. We went at 8pm on a Saturday night and waited maybe 15 minutes....no biggie time for a Sam Adams at the bar. Our servers were Brandy and Brandon. They were super attentive and never missed a beat. She new the menu made smart recommendations and was very nice. In all honesty it is a 4 star restaurant but they need a little help to get back up where they deserve to be."}
{"text":"I made reservations for 7pm.  When I arrived the hostess rudely told me I didn't have a reservation. No apology. No smile. Our server stepped on my husbands shoes and didn't say excuse me. The calamari was so salty I had to return it!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a colleague last night.  It is very close to my office and we seem to find our way in at least 3 or 4 times a month for lunch or dinner. 

Had my first disappointing meal here in over 3 years of coming in.  What I had isn't really important other than to say it was way over cooked.  Burnt in fact.  And so tough i could hardly chew it.

So why the 4 stars?  Because of the way they handled the situation.  The waitress checked in after I had given my best and ate about half of the meal.  I told her about the situation and after apologies, brought the manager over immediately.  He offered to replace the meal without even making me repeat my complaint.  As I had already eaten appetizers, soup (both of which were great) and half the entree I said no, that would not be required and thanked him for the offer.  At this point I was satisfied with the attention because as I said, this was my first disappointment and everyone has a bad day now and then.  He then stated he would remove the entree from our bill without me saying another word.  He graciously apologized, thanked us for our business, and said he hoped we would come in again.

Now THAT's great service."}
{"text":"Nothing like going off the strip to find a good food and going back to the hotel still thinking about that food you just ate."}
{"text":"One of the more embarrassing chains around. Basically a culinary minstrel show. Make-believe \"Asian\" food served alongside alcohol to full the senses, which would be necessary to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Went to dinner lastnight for my sisters college graduation celebration. Hadnt been there in years although I sure missed the food and ambience. Was greeted very nicely at the door and I immediately realized for a Tuesday night in Vegas, it was pretty dead! Back in the day, this place had a waiting line everynight of the week! And the bar used to be a cool hip place to hang out, guess everyone has moved elsewhere?
Anyway, the food was good, the wait staff was very attentive and was happy with the overall experience."}
{"text":"We went to PF Chang's yesterday for lunch before roaming around all the President's Day sales. We were seated right away, there were only a handful of tables occupied at the time. Our server was very friendly and attentive, she was always making sure we were satisfied and taken care of. We went with the meal for 2 deal for $40, not bad. 

Soup: 
Egg Drop: I always love egg drop, it seems hard to mess up. Had good flavor, seasoned well. 
Hot and Sour Soup: generous amount of tofu, the bf could not finish it all. 

Appetizer: 
Dynamite Shrimp: I love this dish and hope they will add it to the regular menu! The sauce is wonderful, packed with lots of flavor and some heat. I wouldn't recommend this to my dieter friends, this is a fried shrimp dish with a cream based sauce. 

Entrée: 
Korean BBQ chicken: had a hint of sweetness overall. Loved the fried green beans, this was a very generous dish in respect to the amount of veggies given. 
Sesame chicken: this was my favorite entrée. The broccoli was refreshing and crispy. 
I love the fact that brown rice is also an option with the entrée. 

Dessert: 
Full sized banana spring rolls: $4 upcharge but so worth it! I LOVE the pineapple coconut ice cream included in the dish. Apparently, it is specially made for P.F. Chang's. Here is a good copy cat recipe:  http://www.aboutamom.com/pineapple-coconut-ice-cream-recipe/
I would buy an ice cream maker just for this!

We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Food is wonderful, service is great... but my poor husband is traumatized after watching two of the servers scratch each other's backs and play with one another's hair right over the ice and tea station. We had a perfect view from the bar. Needless to say he did not get a refill on  his iced tea after seeing that."}
{"text":"I used to love P.F. Chang's but lately this location has been absolute garbage. Yesterday I got takeout of changs spicy chicken and pepper steak and both were just pure salty mushy slop. Threw it out. Didn't even taste like how the entrees should, just pure salt and mush. Utterly atrocious and unacceptable for $35! Management didn't even care. Never going back"}
{"text":"Where do I start with all the things that have gone downhill at this location in the last couple of years?

Not only that, when I went to dinner with a friend last night (I'm a white woman, he's a black man), I got the distinct sense that the mistreatment we got was deliberate. 

Arrived at 5:50pm on a Saturday evening so expected to wait a bit. Was told 35 minute wait. Ok. They ask for my cell number so they can text when it's time for us. Cool.
We sit outside a distance from the door. Quite a few folks outside. Once in awhile one of the hostesses comes out and announces a name one time each. 
We thought maybe we heard our name once, but never got a text. My friend went inside to check after we waited 35 minutes and we were told it's not ready yet. 

An hour total goes by since we arrived. We both go inside to ask the hostess what's going on, nicely I might add.


This little girl looks up at us with complete indifference and says \"I called your name awhile ago and we sent a text\". I replied still nicely \"no, you didn't text me and we came in here after we thought we heard our name and were told it wasn't ready.\" She asked for my phone number again and said that's the one they texted.
Again, I calmly said \"no, you didn't and we've been waiting for an hour now.\"  She kept the shit smelling look on her face when she stared back at me and bluntly said \"we will seat you now.\"

We are led to a booth that looks like homeless people use it as a bed. Seriously??? The seats are all torn and worn like a place that's getting demolished for being a dump.

We didn't complain since we were hungry. Our waitress appeared uncomfortable serving us. She barely forced a smile out the entire time we were there even when we tried joking around and being nice with her. She looked like she wanted to go home, like an antsy kid in a bad mood.

The food was mediocre at best:
Crispy honey shrimp were soggy and gross
They brought out our rice (I ordered brown, my friend ordered white) in ONE bowl lumped side by side. I found that unprofessional. Never had that happen at this or any restaurant. 

The \"surf and turf\" for $23 consisted of barely any steak, a small portion overall, a few shrimp and two little pieces of lobster that were so salty they were barely edible.

Lettuce wraps were brought out looking like a plate of lettuce. Yep they piled ice cold lettuce leaves on top of the meat mixture, totally covering it. Not only did this make the dish cold, it had the look of folks not caring a bit about presentation for the guests. I noted that those around us had their lettuce on the side neatly as it should be. Not ours. 

When the check came, my friend placed his card in the folder and placed it on the edge of the table as is standard protocol for signaling that it's ready. 
The server came by and loudly asked \"is this ready??\" with a look on her face. My friend kindly said \"yes it is.\"

As we were getting up from the table, a male server was talking with his guests next to us which was blocking our exit a bit. I slid partially out of the booth and said excuse me. He looked at me quickly, but kept speaking with his guests and didn't move an inch. I had to get up awkwardly to avoid bumping into him. 

I've never seen such overall unprofessionalism in staff with their attitudes, the sloppy food prep and presentation, and most of all the little hostess with her \"I just smelled a pile of dog shit\" look on her face as she falsely claimed alerting an interracial couple (us) that we had been called for a table when clearly they let us wait for an HOUR despite us checking with them. 

Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Been to this Vegas spot a few times now since it's right by the convention center and we always have great food and a great time.

They must be used to catering to conference folk because they always have suggestions for drinks and or meals as needed. They take extra caution when we ask for Glutten-free food. Their manager brings it out to you.

BTW, their Glutten-free menu is outstanding! You would never know the difference!"}
{"text":"Curry vegetable dish good. Lettuce wrap excellent. One diner wanted a crunchy noodle dish but the waiter recommended one with spaghetti noodles instead. The large cake for dessert served four."}
{"text":"The food was like any other PF Chang, but at this one... the service we received was amazing! Very clean and inviting.
We were a bit confused with the Japanese decor."}
{"text":"This is a place we ALWAYS hit when in Las Vegas. We like the one at Planet Hollywood, too, but this one is nice because there's plentry of parking and close to the hotel we usually stay at.

Lettuce cups are my personal favorite. Also love the crispy green beans and calamari."}
{"text":"Service was soooooo slow. Came for lunch and had their lunch sized orange peel chicken. It was delicious but for $9.50 I was given a child's sized portion of food. Very very tiny lunches. Tasted great but I spent $15 and I'm still hungry :("}
{"text":"I come here all the time and it used to be my favorite restaurant, but not anymore. we sat down at 6:15 and didn't leave until after 8 due to the awful service. I'm young, but not as young as I look, and I feel like that had something to do with it. The server was nice, but extremely slow and carefree. when we were waiting for more than 20 minutes for our order to be taken, we kindly asked the manager to simply let our server know we were ready to order. that's where it all went south. the manager was the rudest manager I have ever encountered and he acted like we were such a bother. once we got our food(40 minutes later) they gave us ONE BOWL of white rice for 4 entrees, and they didn't even bring my boyfriends brown rice. There was also a hair in my food, but I didn't even bother mentioning it because I just wanted to leave at that point. the only pleasant part of the experience were the kind hostesses. I won't be returning. I don't mind paying to go to eat, and I'm a server, so I always tip 30% which made me think they would have known to at least try giving me good service since I've been in multiple times before. I guess not. I won't even waste my time, and you probably shouldn't either."}
{"text":"So grateful for such amazing service! Our waiter was so attentive and great! Food was amazing, awesome environment. Definitely coming back regularly! Elijah was absolutely amazing!! :)"}
{"text":"I went to PF Chang's several years ago in Minnesota and was not impressed but I am always open to giving it another try.  

The environment was very pleasant with great space and lively activity in the many rooms and outdoor area.  The service was courteous and friendly but the food lacked any level of impressiveness.

It was not good.  For the reputation and expansion they have undergone I would have expected better quality food.

For happy hour or just light appetizers, this place is great for groups or friends but for a full dining experience, I would try another place."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Frozen, fried, poisonous. I ate a salad and Buddha's feast and still felt like my brain and body went into chemical override that didn't leave till the next morning. I went because I had a gift certificate but severely regretted not just throwing the GC away. The fish tasted grainy and old, the other stuff tasted freezer burned. Just gross. Not food. . . yuck. 

Our server was awesome!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is SNIDERMAN, SNIDERMAN, SNIDERMAN! Literally, one of the best waiters I've ever had. My mom and I shared a great meal here the other day, made even better by a waiter who knew everything we needed before WE even knew we needed it! THATS what you call a great waiter. Find his section! And if you're new to PF CHANGS... their Kung Pao shrimp will change your life!"}
{"text":"Cheapskate bartender tried to rip us off on a busy Saturday night, hoping we wouldn't see that he had overcharged us on our bill! Thankfully we did catch the \"error\"  and pointed it out to him. And guess what, the dude wasn't surprised at all. Didn't even pause a moment to check what we were telling him. Just mumbled some excuse and said \"OK, I'll get the manager to fix it.\" 

The food was strictly average. We ordered shrimp in lobster sauce and Chang's spicy chicken. Both orders came with a side of rice. We had lettuce wraps for appetizers, and though a lot of reviewers have commented on the lack of their authenticity, I liked them. A party of 20 or so near our table was celebrating some sort of farewell, and their laughter and talk made conversation impossible. Service was extremely slow, which I will put down to the Saturday night traffic. All in all, an average overpriced experience."}
{"text":"I get very frustrated with restaurants that have misguided management practices... With PF Changs, they will make you wait 15 to 20 minutes minimum even if the restaurant is empty.  The management of this mediocre restaurant chain seems to believe by making every guest wait, it ads an air of exclusivity or some sort of scarcity mentality of desirability to their marketing efforts.  They pulled this nonsense on my wife and I today and we walked out, went next door to BJ's and were promptly seated, despite their restaurant being far more busy than P. F. Chang's.  Back when P.F. Changs was briefly the trendy and cool place to go, I enjoyed the food and service, but now that the bloom has worn of the rose and they still try this nonsense of making customers wait, despite available seating, they are just annoying and very trailer-park in atmosphere.  Avoid this restaurant, it is a charade of a business that it once was and does not merit putting up with their silly seating practices."}
{"text":"I took my two nephews here for dinner before heading back to Texas.  I ordered the Oolong Sea Bass, which was stellar, as always.  One of my nephews got it too, and loved it.

The lettuce wraps were very good; however, the portions seem to have shrunk, as there wasn't much filling on the plate.  

The service was very, very good."}
{"text":"I consistently have great meals here.  I've always had good service, the staff is friendly and prompt. My go to meal is the walnut shrimp with melon. Yum...  I also really like their Changs fried rice. 

Tonight we came for a birthday, there were four of us. We had the cashew chicken, walnut shrimp with melon, orange beef and Changs pork fried rice.  It was all very good. 

Lastly, if you like hot tea, as I do; try the Dragon Eye Oolong tea, it's delicious..."}
{"text":"Interior:98/10, Food: 8/10, Service: 7/10.

Came here during a major convention in Vegas so of course this place was packed.

Service was lacking due to the dinner rush. Seemed like they wanted to seat you, feed you, get you out for the next group waiting to be seated.

Typical PF Chang food that's consistent with all the other locations.

Would I go back? Probably not. Too many better restaurants in LV to try out."}
{"text":"First visit and happy hour too! 
Wonderful food very reasonable prices.
Our waitress Galyna was amazing! Smart, helpful, classy and elegant all rolled into one special waitress."}
{"text":"$9.95 for a vodka collins: vodka, lemon juice, syrup, club soda...missing the garnish. Please explain WHY? 9.95.  Dynamite Shrimp had good flavor. Singapore Street Noodles were dry. 
so a let down overall."}
{"text":"I work in the planet Hollywood so I frequent the bar often, I want to tell you everyone of these bartenders are better then they even take credit for so do yourself a favor and don't sit at the table sit at the bar and watch them preform !!'I just love it here ...."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of PF Chang's, but after my most recent visit to the Planet Hollywood location my views have drastically changed. As most people probably skip or skim very lengthy reviews, I'll try my best not to be too long winded. 

In short: Skip this place unless you like RAW CHICKEN and poor service! 

The full story: A group of us we to lunch here while on a Vegas trip for my friend's 29th birthday. The meal started off ok until a friend noticed that her chicken was completely raw on the inside. Not just a little pink, but RAW! it was basically seared chicken covered and concealed in sauce. UNACCEPTABLE. 

To top if off, the manager was hardly accommodating. She did take a small percentage off of my friend's check, but in the end she was still charged for the inedible plate of raw chicken that she was served. 

As we tried to move on from the upset, our server seemed to completely give up on pleasing us in any way. He dropped silverware on multiple members of our party, brought out a dirty dessert spoon for my friends birthday dessert, and then tried to cover it up by saying he had mixed a sauce with it. I'm sorry ... what?? You mixed sauce with a spoon, then brought it out for my friend to eat her birthday dessert with? Then please explain why there is dried brown food stuck to the spoon that you supposedly just mixed raspberry sauce with. We weren't buying it at all. 

We left PF Chang's completely dissatisfied and praying that my friend would make it through the trip without getting sick from having eaten raw chicken. I'd give it NO stars if it were possible.

No thanks to the staff at PF Chang's and despite our lunch celebration being ruined, my friend was ok. Thank goodness!"}
{"text":"Great food. Horrible service. Planned a date night and was going to eat then catch a movie. Unfortunately our waitress only had time enough to take our order. She had a big party in a separate room and was able to tend to their every need but never made it over to check and see if our food was good or if we needed a refill. After an hr and a half... And 
30 + mins after we were done with our entree we had already missed our movie time and were fed up. Even after getting our desserts to go we waited another 10 mins without her giving us our check. The manager was nice enough to take some stuff off our bill, but I will not be going back to this location. I don't normally like to complain and know things can get hectic on a Saturday night, but I feel like she could have at least gave us a refill. We would have given her a fat tip too... Oh well."}
{"text":"First time at this location. I've been coming to PF Chang since they first opened. I've not been in a couple of years. Glad to see they still have some of their classic dishes as well as some new ones on the menu. Food is always fresh with quality ingredients. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly and there to assist and serve. Definitely will be going back. If you sign up for their Rewards program they send you buy one entree get one free."}
{"text":"When we arrived it took 45 minutes to get seated, and it took over an hour to get our food. They messed up our drink and food order, it was very dark and was hard to read the menu. We will not go back to this location again."}
{"text":"I really like PF Changs, although I do wish they would bring back there meal where you get 2 entrees and 1 appetizer and drink for like $25. I was saddened they didn't have this offer anymore. They do have great food though its not like the other Chinese restaurants around town. I think they are really good this location is a convent location for me instead of going to the strip all the time.  The atmosphere is good a-little dark but its the setting and mood that gets you hungry to eat."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with group of 8 on Monday night for dinner. Moderately busy with two St Louis teams on the TV.  Not quite your \"normal\" PF Chang decor ... Place was smaller and more intimate with outside seating to take advantage of the locale. Egg drop soup just to syrupy for me .... Just keep it simple.  Wonton soup +.  Lettuce wraps done quite well, maybe even the highlight    Entrees included Mongolian beef, spicy chicken. Mongolian beef very salty,  otherwise, nice large portions for the entrées. Only downside was the service. We ordered very quickly upon arriving and but did not get our food for approximately an hour."}
{"text":"Potstickers were cold.  Very loud background music hard to communicate.  Food was okay still enjoy the lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times for both take-out and dine in. Lunch and Happy Hour are my favorite times to go.  I enjoy the food and for some reason they have the best chocolate cake I've managed to have.  I'm not sure why there's is the best but it most definitely is!"}
{"text":"Rude! I drove here from Aliante based on hours that read 11 to 11 Monday threw Friday! I walk in at 10:02 they tell me they are closed! I ask for manager and show her the hours online! She could careless! Dismissed me with a sorry! Absolute Bologna! I drive 15 miles for a sorry! I'm done place changed along with the menu!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the most incredible experience at this location. We were greeted by 2 very friendly faces at the hostess stand and were told there would be a 10 minute wait (no reservation). We were sat in less than 5 minutes! Our server Nate was at our table in just a couple minutes to take our drink orders & we took the opportunity to order an appetizer. The drinks flew to our table and the appetizer was shot out of a cannon, both were at our table in maybe 5 minutes, probably less. Nate came by to check on us at least 2 times before we narrowed down our entrees. The entrees were out within a reasonable time (maybe 20-25 minutes) and piping hot. DELICIOUS! Nate again checked on our table another 2 or 3 times before we were finished. He was such a joy & really made our dinning experience even more special. Thanks Nate! We will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Wide range of Asian foods:  Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Philippine.  Everything is made fresh with great care.  The garnishes are amazing as well as every dish that I have had.  A classy decor rather dimly lit with excellent service.  Ask for a doggy box and they create a masterpiece.  They make their own ginger beer.  Best egg rolls this side of Hong Kong.
If you want a feast without spending a lot, you can order off of the happy hour menu and get several items including a happy hour beverage for 5 or 6 dollars per item."}
{"text":"So we were on our way to another restaurant further down The Strip when we realized we wouldn't make it in time because we were pressed for time with show tickets and still had quite a bit longer to walk to the other restaurant (The Strip is very deceiving distance-wise!). We ended up eating at the PF Changs and they were able to seat us right away and we sat outside on the patio. The patio area was nice because it was right on The Strip, but had an enclosed area to separate it from all of the crowds walking by.

Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, however, it did take awhile for our entrees to come out. He went back and checked on them and did apologize that it took so long for them to come out. Our water glasses were kept refilled, which was important given how hot Las Vegas was when we visited in mid-May. 

I ordered what I usually order at P.F. Chang's which is the Crispy Honey Chicken. The dish was good, but I wasn't able to eat too much of it due to the delay in it coming out and having to run to get to the show. We also got the 6 hand folded crab wontons from the dim sum menu (I had a coupon for a free birthday appetizer or dessert). Overall a good meal; however, being in Vegas, I don't know that I would pick to eat at P.F. Chang's again if we weren't so pressed for time and it wasn't right there just because there are so many other dining options."}
{"text":"I can't say thank you enough to Andrea I believe she is a hostess, I called earlier to check on something and she took care of me with a smile on her face! I came in way after 8 hrs of her helping me with my \"order\" on the phone and I was waiting on the other hostess to even pay attention to me, thn she left and Andrea happened to come up and ask if I had been helped... she deserves a raise for sure!! Good job on hiring her PF Chang's!!!"}
{"text":"We first tried soothing lettuce wraps at the Reno Air Races and loved them so we were pleased to get a chance to go to the restaurant it self. Figure if the food they make at an event is good the restaurant will be even better. So we visited for lunch while at CinemaCon this year. We were pleasantly surprised. Our waiter was very good. The food was just what I wanted. I can not say enough good things about our visit. Waiter (I wish I remembered his name, Has tattoos, used to have an old scooter in Reno) He did an excellent job! He recommended wine and cocktails for us, was friendly (hence how I heard he used to have a scooter, He commented on my scooter tattoo) and still very professional and attentive. We had a great time and can not wait to visit again.  Also please tell corporate we want PF Changs back at the races! We missed you in 2012!"}
{"text":"My review is because of the inconvenience and inefficiency of using Grubhub through this site. I ordered & paid through here, when I showed up to pick up my ordered they hadn't even received it. I'm sure Grubhub was paid a fee when it would've been faster for me to just order when I got there. Instead I had to spend 10-15 minutes on the phone with them since they had already charged my card."}
{"text":"There is nothing negative I can say about this place!!!  From the moment we walked in the door until the time we walked out. Food-excellent, service-outstanding, prices-reasonable. I love this place!!  If you go, try the chicken lettuce wraps, they are phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of getting wonderful Chinese food for my family to go, and a glass of wine at P F Chang's last night. If you ever want fantastic Asian fare and great service, this is the place. You will be very lucky if Gina is your server, she's great."}
{"text":"We always ask for gift cards to this place during Christmas for our Vegas trips. It's nestled inside Planet Hollywood Hotel, where you can see the slot machines and what not from the bar. We've only sat at the bar. So this review is for the bartenders, who are great! 

Hands down my favorite thing on the menu: Chicken or Vegetarian Lettuce Wraps. Pear Mojitos. And the steamed dumplings. 

They have a killer happy hour. Awesome service. Nice bartenders. Comfy chairs."}
{"text":"Being from Vancouver where there's a lot of great Asian cuisine, my friend and I didn't see the need to dine at a place which serves Asian food. But after eating Caucasian food non stop since we landed, we decided to give this place a try. We were also intrigued by the line up outside the restaurant; and since we've never eaten here we thought we'd try this place. 

My first impression of the place was 'wow'. A huge and quite a classy place so I was impressed right off the bat. Right outside, people can be spectators and watch the busy kitchen as they scoop, portion, scale, deep fry, pan fry and prepare the food. I'm always fascinated by this because this looks really cool to me. Anyway, my friend and I waited around half an hour for our food, which I wasn't very happy about. Thank goodness I had something to watch for half an hour while they make my food. 

We ordered the Crab Wontons, Singapore Street Noodles, and the Shanghai Shrimp with Garlic Sauce. The wontons were nice and crispy, I LOVED the filling. The shrimp dish was pretty decent. I found the vegetables quite soft, which was surprising because Asian restaurants usually serve vegetables quite crisp. Well in Vancouver anyway. The noodle dish had a nice ,strong curry flavor. The shrimp was cooked well but the chicken was kinda tough and sinewy.

Overall it was ok. I think the fact that I'm immersed in a wide variety of Asian cuisine here at home makes me more critical of Asian cuisine elsewhere. My friend best described it as \"white man's version of Asian food\". Which is actually very true. 

Good value for the price; I'm quite annoyed that I completely missed the dessert menu. I really wanted to try the Banana Spring Rolls, the Tres Leche Lemon Dream, the Apple Pie and the Carrot Cake. But really, I shouldn't be eating dessert while in Vegas. Just bad for my gut. 

There's also a gluten free menu for you guys and gals who can't have gluten.

Would I come back? Maybe. It wouldn't be the first place I would think of visiting but I would consider it. It gets a 3.5/5 from me, but I think I'll kick it down to 3/5 stars. It could be a lot better."}
{"text":"My mom loves it here!!! I think it's a bit over rated though. We tried all the waitress's recommendations and needless to say we should have let her a note with our tip letting her know she may want to pick better recommendations. She was a really nice lady though and very attentive. I don't think I had to worry about asking for a refill all night. Great service! Food was just okay."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great place to celebrate a birthday or you have a big group, this place is awesome. You totally can order family style and the service is on point. Also, it is out of the ordinary.

However, it would not be my first choice for Chinese food. Do not get me wrong it taste good, but it is too Americanized. I rather get my Chinese food greasy and salty.

If you save room for dessert, you should definitely taste the Banana Spring Rolls. They are delicious."}
{"text":"I cannot begin to tell what an amazing experience my boyfriend and I had here. The food was so tasty! Our bartender, Shannon was nothing short of spectacular. We came during happy hour and it wasn't crowded at all. I will be back next time we are in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I think p.f stands for Paul Flemming. It definitely does not stand for Pretty Fabulous. It should be called PT Changs. As in Pretty Terrible. 

We had the orange peel chicken, shaking beef, Dan Dan noodles, and wonton soup. 
All were served at a mediocre temperature, and quite salty. Service was a bit rude, but in a passive aggressive way. The server was very clear to correct me on my pronunciation of Dan Dan. 

There is a reason I avoid chains like this, and this reminds me why. Sub par food to just fill my stomach. I think it will be a while until I return."}
{"text":"Horrible. Horrible food and horrible service. Man, this place has gone way downhill. I made a reservation Sunday night for 14 of us on Tuesday for my nephews b-day. The hostess had to put me on hold to ask a manager if it was ok. Um...ok? Mgr was super nice and penciled us in. I got a call on Monday AND Tuesday to confirm my reservation...ok. no biggie. We get there and there's literally 2 other tables in the whole place. I didnt catch the servers name but she had a very unique style of serving. She kept asking us if she could \"snag an order\". Like any other restaurant, we wanted appetizers first, then our entrees to come out together. Nope, not this place. Our apps came out sporadically and my uncle got his app as his entree because she never came back to snag his order. He was fine with that as all the plates were decently sized and we shared. My nephew and his girlfriend got their food before my side of the table even ordered. WTF? When I pointed this out to her that we all came in together and wanted to eat together....ya know, like normal, she apologized, which was nice but we were all eating different things at different times and it was just weird. The 4 of us at the end were still eating while my nephew opened gifts and ate dessert. Lame. Everyone pretty much enjoyed what they got except the pad thai was gross. The chicken seemed undercooked a bit and I asked for no cilantro which apparently means extra cilantro but no peanuts. I traded it for the spicy chicken and that was decent. Overall, I will not be back and this is again why people should support locally owned businesses and stay away from corporate."}
{"text":"Desperate times call for desperate measures. While normally avoiding this type of place, I'm feeling under the weather and a friend offered to go pick up something for me. It's close and I could order online. But the pad Thai? Death my salt. So salty, I needed to add sweetness, so I drizzled some honey on it so it would be edible. As for the vegetable coconut curry, it was awful. Way too salty, and overall a boring dish. The tiny side of rice tasted like it had been sitting in the rice cooker all day. totally dry. I should have known better. My bad. Waste of $20."}
{"text":"Why?

That's all I can really think. Why? Why do most people prefer generic chain restaurants over the local flair? Why is it that places like PF Chang's are considered \"like, oh my god, sooo good!\"? Why? 

I mean, the food is edible. It has flavor. The  menu offers variety. You get to eat your food in a comfortable setting with somebody waiting on you, refilling your glass, clearing the table... And then you get to go back to your ordinary lives.

Ok, so maybe I'm being a little too hard on PF Chang's. I'm not the first person to diss chain restaurants. I'm not even the first to secretly admit to liking a few. I do. But, when given the option of exploring a local eatery that sells more than the \"paint by numbers\" entrees, I'll pick the original, exciting and off-the-beaten-path place 99.4% of the time."}
{"text":"Changs' is one of my absolute favorite places to go, so when I was on travel to Charlotte and my boyfriend came to visit, there was no debate what was for dinner.  However...we ordered the spicy chicken and orange peel beef.  The chicken was not at all what I had at another Chang's.  Very bland.  The \"sauce\" on the beef was also bland, and the \"beef\" itself was nothing more than fired flour.  You could still see loose dry flour on it!  We sent it back, and the very apologetic waiter replaced it with beef a la sichuan, our favorite dish there normally.  It was also flour-y but burned!  Even the vegetables in it tasted burnt.  I sent it back and explained the issue to the waiter who said he would send the manager out.  The manager never came, but they did take the beef off the meal.  My boyfriend had the dynamite shrimp, and it was overly battered and not at all what he's had at other Chang's locations.  Needless to say, we left hungry and upset.  Overall, very unimpressed.  We will not be back at that Chang's."}
{"text":"Horrible.
At one time PF Chang's had great food. 
Now not a shadow of what it once was. 

This location has indifferent college student employees, expensive, mediocre food and goofy service. 

The lobster shrimp rice is a joke and they never checked back for refills or if the food was ok. 
Wiped down the messy, sticky table with a bare hand, no towel. 
The place has defaulted to ridiculous.

Beware! Perking impound tow trucks in the vicinity that are real busy. They don't even shut their engines off. Just lying in wait or hauling someone off to the impound compound.
Make sure you park where it's ok to."}
{"text":"Surly Las Vegas tourist trap attitude employees. Asshole bartender. I imagine it's not unusual for an employee to get punched by a customer.

If you go into a 'Vegas restaurant and the employees don't wear name tags, expect tourist trap attitude. You can't report them on the company website and they know it.
A manager that let's this happen won't do anything anyway.

Food just OK and same as any other PF Changs with low quality, tough cuts of meat, stale rice, and not a lot of options for a group because of the price-fixe, pick 2 item for 2 policy.

You can go to PF Changs anywhere for the same old thing. Consider in 'Vegas go to some place unique.  You have a greater choice of fantastic restaurants for the same money in Sin City, use it.

5 star reviews are fake and from employees."}
{"text":"Another outing to this P.F. Chang's yielded a pleasant dinner with friends.  This time I didn't order as many preliminaries as I usually do.  Yet what I did order was very good as ever, except the Wonton Soup included noticeably unseasoned chicken.

My order of wok-fired Filet Mignon was medium rare as requested, even though our server informed me in advance of the difficulty in nailing this temperature exactly while quick-frying in a wok.  Shrimp-Fried Rice was studded with ample succulent medium-sized shrimps.  And wok-tossed Brussels Sprouts provided a welcome extra touch.  

Diane enjoyed an order of Walnut Shrimp, and our friends were pleased with Harvest Curry and Honey Chicken  A heavy metallic pot of Sweet Ginger Hot Tea washed everything down nicely for me, while Diane preferred a pot of Citrus Spice Tea for this purpose.  

Our reservation was honored upon arrival.  Booth seating was comfortable amid Asian decor, and service was very attentive."}
{"text":"This is my first review of this P.F. Chang's.  I'm happy to report that they tend to be consistent.  Heading out to California, we just made the dining room with less than half an hour to spare before closing time, and were the last diners sitting.  So, we closed the place, which I learned can have some nice advantages--like all the cups of Hot & Sour Soup you want, and larger food portions than normal.  It's a choice inside the kitchen between discarding extra food or giving it to remaining diners.

So, Diane and I very much enjoyed sipping fragrant Ginger Peach Tea in dainty white teacups as we worked our way through our Four-Course Prix-Fixe meals.  The Hot & Sour Soup with strips of pork was hot and great.  I was willing to pay extra for more, but didn't have to.  

Salt & Pepper Calamari Strips resting on a bed of hard white Rice Noodles were good but a bit hard themselves.  The spicy Bean Sauce that accompanied this appetizer was tasty, and, surprisingly, so were the Rice Noodles.

Then, while Diane savored her Crispy Honey Shrimp, which was sweet and succulent (when I report on the taste of a dish, I have always sampled it myself, rather than just adopting a fellow diner's words--even a wife's), I delighted in the really meaty and chewy Pepper Steak that was served with more fluffy Steamed White Rice than we could handle.  But the viscous, flavorful sauce got really spicy at the end of the meal.  It's a wonder we got to our home in southern California without a rest stop!

We finished with two mini-desserts.  My Triple Chocolate Mousse Mini Dessert  featured three different types of delicious chocolate mousse poured and set in distinct vertical layers, and was simply great.  It was fun to dig to a new level, and soon afterward be greeted by a fresh chocolatey taste sensation.  Our spacious booth was comfortable, and our server, Michael, was very accommodating and proactive through the entire duration of our late dinner.  Filled water glass replacements showed up ahead of need.  Even the music had a nice beat to it.  And the tab for food for two was under $40--a great deal!  So, we walked out happy. 

4-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"Meal was about what I expected. Service was good, not exceptional but good. They are trying a new menu with tacos for breast cancer awareness.  A nice thought but they should stay in their wheelhouse which is Asian. Obviously stick with what you know..."}
{"text":"First time we have been here it was a great change from the normal Chinese much better but more expensive also will defiantly be back. Service was great"}
{"text":"My go to Chinese restaurant in Madison area. Don't expect the food to be authentic Chinese though, is more suited for a American palette but the quality of food and service is unbeatable. There are so many menu options and the taste is consistent."}
{"text":"The food was great BUT I took my mom there for her belated birthday on 4/11/14. My brother passed away during her birthday in March so this was a special occasion for us. I let the hostess know it was her birthday so she can get a special dessert with a candle. She mentioned she would let my server know. No special dessert ever came. I saw the server had brought a birthday dessert for the table across the way. I asked him if he was notified of the occasion and he said no and he didn't bring it out anyway. I was unhappy with the service."}
{"text":"First time here on July 4th when it wasn't busy just so I could relax without the rush and had a bad visit. Good food but drinks were out after our food came out"}
{"text":"Their service here is awesome! Our server was cute and very patient around me and my friends even though we were giggling and kinda loud haha. Food here is so amazing. Sushi is yummy! Their lettuce wrap was incredible and great variety of drinks. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Outrageous Flavors! We started with the Lettuce Wraps! 1 bite and I was drooling! Yum! Then came the Dynamite Shrimp! KaBam! Right in your face! My tongue was jumping up and down in glee! Nothing short of spectacular food! They even serve our favorites #OffTheMenu Orange Beef and Garlic Noodles! What A Celebration of Food on my 60th Birthday!  Yea For Me!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst meal I've ever had at a PF Chang's. A lot of this had to do with our inefficient (but sweet) waitress who served our cocktails after we'd finished our appetizers and brought my son the salt he asked for (twice) after he'd finished eating. She would stop to have loooong conversations with every table before checking on the late drinks, etc. 

My seasonal Cucumber Blueberry Crush cocktail was so sour, I only had a few sips (after adding water). The lettuce wraps were full of fat and skin and served atop crunchy rice noodles that crunched like sand between my teeth. Our kids loved the crab wontons, though. Our Mongolian beef and ginger chicken were both excessively oily.

The food was mostly mediocre and not worth the PF Chang's name brand up charge. Not clamoring to come back here."}
{"text":"Went in this evening to take advantage of a free appetizer. It stated on coupon must be eaten in restaurant vs take out. I'm on a walker due to a cracked knee cap. We planned to take advantage of appetizer and order dinner. They had no table that could accommodate me, the manager still refused to let us order everything to go. Not only did they lose out on a substantial order they also humiliated me. I alway enjoy this restaurant, however if that's how they treat people with special needs we won't go back. The male manager was very rude. He would not even try to make this a win win situation. Shame shame on a chain of their size. Poor management skills."}
{"text":"PF Changs food never disappoints although the wait times can be horrendous.  When visiting the last time, the wait was about an hour so we decided to visit the bar.  The bar staff was awesome and asked us if we would like to eat there so we turned in our pager and plopped ourselves down.  The bar staff was so attentive and made great suggestions.  We will always sit at the bar from now on.  I love that they have so many gluten free options!  The mongolian beef is my favorite by far!!"}
{"text":"I just want to eat something spicy, and PH Chang works well for me. The spicy Chicken soup is so good! It says serves for six people, but my husband and I finished all.
And I tried the soup in VA, since I travel I want it and it is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a corporate story. This means their menu and items may be quite different than what you're used to at other PF Chang's.  

Waiter was pretty good.  We had to ask for plates to eat the appetizers on.

Pricing is as expected.

He kept the beverages filled.

The one less star is because the menu was not quite as expected from the other locations."}
{"text":"The food was great this time. No over salted side items, and fish was cooked perfectly.

This visit's low rating is because at take out, a new take out person made a clear point of it to tell me that \"There is a TIP line for you to leave a tip.\"  WTH???  First of all, I know there is a tip line.  Secondly, tipping is usually for table service.  Third, tipping is not a requirement. And finally, but most importantly, do not direct to tip or imply that you deserve a tip. It it tacky, unpleasant, and whomever is training new people should clearly tell the wait staff NOT to point out specifically that \"there is a tip line for you\".  Entitlement is not attractive.  This makes me not want to return."}
{"text":"Server was excellent and knowledgeable. Food came out perfect. We will definitely be back. Woukd like to see more vegan/vegetarian dishes."}
{"text":"Horrible from start to finish. I haven't been back to this location in over a year and things have surely gone downhill. Me and my husband had lunch yesterday. We walked in at about 3:30. The section we were sitting in had a total of 4 tables being used the rest of the restaurant was pretty empty. We sat down the waiter took our drink order and left. From the beginning our waiter was ver standoffish. Anyways he took our Order we got the meal for 2 for 40 dollars. The chicken was dry the quality of the food has definitely gone down. It took him forever to get me a new beer and for him to refill my husbands drink. I ordered siracha and got it at the end of my meal! The rice was mediocre  at best. At the end of the meal we ordered another order of drinks and never got it. So we payed our tab and left. I was so disappointed :( never coming back to this location.  60 dollars gone and a bad taste in my mouth.  The only reason I gave two stars was because the dessert which we got to go because the lack of service was making me really upset was pretty good."}
{"text":"PFC usually has a cult following of which I'm not apart of lol....BUT... this was the best I have tasted of their food. You can't beat the location. 

Sitting outside for full view of the passerbys if you can handle the heat would be best. Our server gave us an extra umbrella for more shade. The portions were plentiful and had more than enough to bring back to our hotel."}
{"text":"The ambience was great the place looked like it belonged in some magizine.  The service was a little lacking but overall it was a good place to go.  I came after the lunch rush and the resturant was quiet."}
{"text":"Second time at PF Chang's in Vegas, having been to the off-strip location before and liked it. This one in Summerlin has a nicer atmosphere and of course the food is no different. I come here principally for their gluten-free options, which are fairly priced, and taste as good as the regular fare. It's great to be able to eat good food and not have to worry about whether the restaurant will be able to cope with my requirements!

They also have a great drinks menu. My only complaint was having to wait 20 minutes for a table, even with a reservation. I'm sure I'll be back though!"}
{"text":"Love the crispy green beans and dynamite shrimp.  My hubby like the General Tao's.  Service was good.  YUM craving crispy green beans now.... may have to go for lunch today :)"}
{"text":"my friends and i came here on our first night because one can never go wrong with P.F. Chang's.  we were 10 minutes late for our reservation thanks to the Planet Hollywood employees not knowing where we could purchase tickets for the Prince Impersonator. but even though we were late, the lovely hostess sat us right away.

the look and feel of the restaurant was nice. next time, I'd love to eat upstairs in the private area where they had a wedding rehearsal dinner going on.

be daring and try this season's \"Spicy Paloma\" -a drink made with Jalapeño Tequila, fresh jalapeño slices, mixed with freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice. delicious and refreshing with a little kick at the end."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful place to eat! The service was amazing and friendly! Our server, Paolo, was out of this world! He needs a raise!!!

The food was top notch as well. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I seriously hate coming to this location but it is always where we end up. The service is terrible, almost 100% of the time, and the food prep and quality is incredibly inconsistent. Do not get me wrong, the server's are friendly and personable enough but the hustle is not there. Also after my drinks come they are scarce until the food comes, wherein they check back maybe once. It seems they are always waiting in the kitchen and only come out when they group together multi table actions. Goodness forbid that I get individual experience and not just a passing of here's the soup got to go get drink orders at another table without seeing to your needs... 

I have been here where the food is spot on but were we are one of 3 tables in the joint yet our party of 3 or less takes an hour and forty minutes to get out. Usually it is the last 30 minutes that drag, and I have noticed it is waiting for the bill, paying for the bill, waiting for change, etc. And I see that it is a thing ever server does at this location. They won't make individual trips to take care of one guests needs at a time. When I finally get my bill after waiting 10+ minutes since my food was packed and bagged I will get the bill, after the other tables food, drinks are boxed. Then as all that is happening I am waiting another 10+ minutes to give my card to my server. And repeat the process. 

The irony is when they are busy they could turn my table over in less than 5 minutes but yet we have this stupid process to endure. I cannot stand it! And Everytime my family wants to eat here I beg and plead to go to Scottsdale, yet for whatever reason we are back in the hamster wheel repeating past mistakes."}

{"text":"Literally...the worst dining experience of my life. So much went wrong (I will TRY to keep it short).

I made a reservation for 8pm, 8 people on a Saturday. I called at 5pm, giving ample notice. Walk in at 7:58 (2 minutes early) and the table isn't ready. No bother, we wait outside, chit chat but happen to notice a very sparsely occupied patio, which we could have sat at. 20 minutes later. No table. Finally at 8:40 we sit down. What use are reservations? But this isn't the worst part...

We sit and wait for another 10 minutes and are approached by a frantic server: Can I get you drinks? Sure. We order an excess. (You're about to get tipped well if you can make this happen tonight).  Waiting on the drinks...my throat is getting parched...where are the drinks? We get them another 20 minutes later (It's already 9pm folks...an hour after I was supposed to have my table). Here comes Mr. Frantic again - Brings 2 drinks...we're missing some.  He apologizes and confesses he forgot to ring in the other.. Ya kidding me? Finally drops it off. Cool... 

But the fun doesn't stop there. My friend orders an appetizer. Expresses she wants THIS to be her entree...to be brought out with everyone else's. It does not happen. He just stares at the table, his mouth agape. Say something. Fix this. Send the Manager over. Do something.

Next up? I don't eat meat...I am served meat. Cool. Frantic Server Dude is now blaming someone else for this transgression and has the Manager come over to drop off my meager  portion of food. The MANAGER says nothing. Not \"Sorry, not how are you this evening? Apologies n such.\" Just drops it off, and forces a smile. What are we doing wrong here as patrons? Am I on freaking Candid Camera?! (what happened to that show anyway...)

Ugh...At this point we all just want to shovel food down our throats and get the hell out. We do the 2 for $40 deal. Where's the dessert we ordered? Blame the Cooks Magoo has his back turned to our table, and is chatting away with his friends. This is not a joke. We sit...and sit...and sit...Ya think he would have turned around at some point to, I don't know: Check on his customers who are going to be tipping him.  Finally my friend taps him on the shoulder and asks if he can box up the dessert so we can just take it with us.

I open my leftovers today and not everything's in there. I hate this place. Hate. Slow...yet the servers run around like chickens with their heads cut off. The food isn't great, that's IF they can get your order right in the first place. It's pointless getting a reservation. OH and IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY.  They knew this! Their home office should really make a secret shop and see what's happening at the Mill Ave location.

Ya suck.  Don't eat here. I know it's Mill...but save yourself the 2 hour shit show I experienced."}
{"text":"I order take out from this location. I get there with my 18 month old son and appears to be no issues. I pay for my food the girl hands me my bag. I \"assume\" the girl checked the bag for me to make sure what I ordered was in the bag which was my mistake. I drive 15 minutes to get back home only to realize I got somebody else's order. I called and told them this and the girl told she realized she gave me the wrong bag 10 minutes after I left and told me to come back for my order. I get back there after driving another 15 minutes back to this location and the girl apologizes and I have to wait for my order as I told the girl on the phone prior to me coming back that I do not want my food to be cold so they remade it which I appreciate but come on put a priority on this as I already was given the wrong food when I got there initially .  What really irritates me is that I had to ask for part of my bill to be taken care of because the girl gave me the wrong bag when I 1st got there. I guess I learned my lesson too never trust someone knows how to give you the right bag before leaving."}
{"text":"This is the worst PF Chang's I've ever been to and I've eaten in them across the country and even in Mexico City. 

Earlier in the week I ordered carryout. The miso sea bass tasted like charcoal lighter fluid. And none of my sauces ie Soy, chili etc were in the bag and neither were the plates and chop sticks. Why ask on the online order form if you're not going to read it?

So tonight I decided to stop in and actually eat there. The service was great but the food was awful. The wonton soup was barely warm and the sea bass was also not hot and had no flavor, which might have been a blessing after earlier in the week.

The sea bass is my absolute favorite, or it used to be until you all ruined it for me. Get your act together, I'll be coming to Beachwood weekly for the next 6 months and I'd really like to enjoy a meal here."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  We ordered online (on their website) for a pick up order an hour and a half in advance.  Got confirmation and all.  When I arrived, no one had any record of the order, nor any way to figure out what happened.  After three staffers, finally they brought over a manager, whose solution was 'well, we can make your order now, shouldn't be more than 25-30 minutes' - uhhhh.  The solution is to ask me to wait another half hour at the service bar (standing)????  No way will I go back."}
{"text":"In all honesty, some of my PF Chang's experience have been more than A-OK, but it's hard for me to justify awarding more stars to this delicious chain.

This is the second time I've visited this location and both times have been just that, A-OK. Nothing memorable, nothing out of this world. PF Chang's is good, consistent, and overall dependable meal.

They recently added a few fall items to the menu and the Harvest Curry is delicious. Coconut milk based and loaded with vegis that aren't over cooked and still maintained a nice crunch. Do yourself a favor and try this! It's causing me to consider another star."}
{"text":"What happened to P.F. Chang's? Haven't been in years decided to go on date night with the hubby and if it weren't for the really sweet waiter it would have completely sucked. Food was blah. Won't be going back. Sad to see this chain go from being the spot to not at all."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I sat at the bar.  I ordered blackberry tea, I got regular. No big deal. I ordered lunch beef and the food came out pretty quick, but it turns out they gave me the dinner and I even pointed to the lunch. I didnt realize until 8 got the check. Nobody  checked back on me but that's no big deal either, at first. manager came by after about 5-8 minutes in, I was still doin ok, but he could of refilled my tea but I figured the bartender would be by in a minute. nope. I finally had to flag down one of the bartender for tea. He refilled it and quickly left without asking if I needed anything else. I was out of the small amount of rice I got. I could not catch anyone's eye. the other female bartender walked by me multiple time and I could not get her attention. After about 15 minutes of bartenders walking right by me as I tried to get there attention. I filly got her attention. I had been done with dishe's stacked for 10. it was not busy at all and there were three bartenders! This was about 400pm. The staff was completely oblivious to what service is. I shouldn't have to flag down my server to see them after they put in my order, wich they failed at anyway. Pay attention people! They get two stars because I like the food."}
{"text":"The food here is always very tasty but for some of us the sodium content is off the chart. They need a low sodium menu."}
{"text":"I generally like PF Changs food, but the service at this location has been poor on too many occasions to warrant more than 3 stars.  For example yesterday I went in for lunch (party of 2) and while we were seated in the half-full restaurant right away we never, ever saw our server.  After I warmed up two seats- the first was under an air duct so I switched to the other side of our table- and both of us had picked out what we'd like for an our entrees, along with the lettuce wraps as an app, we still hadn't had a server acknowledge our existence, let alone take a drink order.  We gave him/her another two minutes, and then left.  This isn't the first time I've had really slow service here, but it is the first time I've walked out of the place.

With that said, I generally get the lettuce wraps here- but ask for extra lettuce if you need it instead of cramming everything in the few they give you (other locations I've been to have their servers do this automatically- after all lettuce is cheap!), and they have a pretty large gluten free section for anyone in your party with wheat allergies."}
{"text":"Nasty, nasty...dirty. Dim Sum happy hour was nothing to write about. The food set me back to not set in their doors again."}
{"text":"Even though PF Changs is not real and authentic Chinese/Asian food and a chain, I will give some credit to some of the food I had last night.  My buddy and I went there just for the hell of it, as I haven't been to one in years.  I got a PF-X drink, which I highly recommend.  It has some mango rum, sprite, and something else that gives a well balanced drink.  He got a pear mojito which was okay, since I am not a big fan of mojitos.  We sat at the bar and got incredible service and attention from the bartender there.  I give an extra start to PF Chang because I think they value customer service.

As an appetizer we got chicken lettuce wrap.  It is a diced up chicken in soy sauce that goes into an empty fresh lettuce.  To complement our dish, our bartender made a sauce mixed with soy, chili pepper, and mustard.  This added a nice kick to our lettuce wraps.  

My man dish was the mahi mahi with lemon grass cilantro brown rice.  The lemon grass was almost as good as lemon grass from a Thai restaurant, and that is saying quite a bit.  My friend got the honey glazed chicken, which was okay.

Overall was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I purchased To Go a Moo Goo Gai Pan and a Sesame Chicken yesterday. So much is wrong with PF Chang's. First, the amount of food was not worth $30.00. Second, the Sesame Chicken is noted on your menu as \"spicy\". Not even close...it actually had NO flavor. Last, the Moo Goo Gai Pan sauce was actually water. Absolutely no flavor, no sauce was added. It was tasteless and awful. Panda Express way better and much, much cheaper. You've been warned."}
{"text":"If you are looking to add a potentially lethal dose of sodium to your diet this is your spot"}
{"text":"I usually don't eat at many chain restaurants while vacationing. I was in the mood for Chinese, so we went to this P.F. Chang's for lunch. The restaurant was very busy during prime lunch hours. Our meals were good (same as other P.F. Chang's). This location is huge but expected since it's in Vegas. The patio area is a great place to eat while enjoying Vegas weather. If you're a person who likes to eat and people watch, P.F. Chang's patio area is definitely for you. Surprisingly, service was attentive and friendly. This P.F. Chang's is a decent choice if you're craving Chinese or P.F. Chang's while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fast takeout service and quality food is what this place is all about. My order (Moo Goo gai pan) was ready before my chosen pick up time. The food was fresh and they add a good amount of shrimp & chicken. Their fried rice is also very good. A lot of restaurants give you the worst bag for your takeout, but not
PF Changs! A sturdy paper bag with handles is more than appreciated.
One negative may be the parking. Their lot was pretty full, and there's a sign that directs you to additional parking across the street. The restaurant does, however, have designated spaces for takeout and you can use their curbside pickup! 
I do not use that, it seems cheesy.
Parking at The District can be tricky, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"today is the 2nd time within 1 month that my order was wrong.  My fault I should have known to check before I left the restaurant.  A month ago, I did a catering order for work.  We were missing a bit of our order. I emailed the restaurant and received no response.   Today, my order was to be ready at 12:50, so i get there at 12:50.  It isn't until I reach my destination that i notice once again my order is missing an item and that my order is COLD. It had been sitting there for over a half hour even though I was told NOT to come pick it up until 12:50.   This is what you get with chains..."}
{"text":"Stopped into PF Chang the other night before a movie. I had a reservation so as soon as I walked in I was greeted and seated at our table. Everyone was so friendly and fast. We let our waitress know that we needed to be out of there by a certain time to catch our movie and she did her best to accommodate us. They had an awesome special for $40 for 2 people. It comes with 2 soups, an appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 bowls of rice and a Dessert (2 Wontons). We both ordered the Wonton Soup which was soooo delicious. I'd never had it before. I was surprised to find the shrimp in it. For our appetizer we ordered the Dynamite Shrimp and an extra appetizer of the Calamari. The shrimp were really good. The sauce they put on them didn't have too much kick but it was flavorful. The Calamari on the other hand I could have done with. Not that great but still edible. It was cut into thin pieces. kind of like short french fries. Not great. Their entrees are Family Style, so we ordered the Beef w/Broccoli and Sesame Chicken and both of us got Brown Rice which came with the entree. The Rice was super dry and boring. It tasted literally like they took raw brown rice and cooked it not adding anything to it. The Sesame chicken was just ok. We even told our waitress that we didn't really care for it. She just said oh and walked away. The showstopper was the Beef w/Broccoli. It was super yummy!! Bold flavors with big pieces and filling. This was the only thing that helped us leave floating on a cloud. The wontons dessert was a ripoff. I guess this is where they save money in the deal. They give you two wontons, one of ours was half the size of the other. I noticed it immediately and grabbed the bigger piece :-). They were pretty good though. Melt in your mouth. But I wouldn't order any on their own if I returned. Overall it was an ok dinner. We left full at least."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the other night.  I've been to other PF Chang's before, but not this location.  I felt a little under-dressed... maybe the SouthPark crowd has a different definition of \"casual\" dining... but oh well nobody really called me out, but I definitely noticed a different \"dress code\" everyone else was following.  I didn't get the memo.

Anyways, the most important part:  the food!.  I ordered a chinese beer and a cup of egg drop soup to start... Lemon Scallops as my main dish with brown rice.  YUM.  There wasn't anything left on my plate.  I probably could have eaten more, but the portion size was good.

The parking lot at Phillips Place can be a nightmare sometimes.  Some people don't follow directions too well and park in spaces that are not spaces!  Anyways, I give myself a lot of time to get there so I was able to find a space with no problem, it was just getting out since some ____ (insert colorful word there) parked behind me and I had a time trying to back out of my legal parking space.

Our server was nice even though we were a big group and we also had a 1 year old with us.  He was a good sport about it and kept our glasses refilled and made sure all our food was good. 

Overall a good dinner."}
{"text":"Great tempura cauliflower, wonderful Chang's spicy chicken!  Very special thanks to Waianae for such great service!"}
{"text":"I, as a server appreciate good service and let me tell you victor was amazing. I have a shellfish allergy and my friends ordered lettuce wraps and asked him if they contained any, he was not sure so he not only checked he printed out a sheet of things that were okay for me to have , lettuce wraps are not one of them ( . Our food was served quickly and are drinks were always full. service 5 ***** food 4 only because I couldn't have fried rice either ( My food was served on a different plate so the kitchen was aware of my allergy which makes me more comfortable eating here.   I definitely will be back. Thanks Victor"}
{"text":"This was not my first choice tonight, but sometimes things work out for the best. I started with the crab wonton which are delicious. I should have taken taken a photo because the presentation is pretty colorful. 

I sat at the bar and the service was fast and friendly and the bartender recommended a very good beer.

The ambience is perfect, as you would expect from PFC. The doors to the casino are closed so noise level is pretty low for Vegas.

Main course was surf and turf. The filet mignon was super tender and flavorful and the Lobster was perfect tempura style with very light panko and also very tender."}
{"text":"Terrible take out experience last week. Several staff members were there and it was not busy but everyone seemed confused. It took about 20 min to get my order after the time it was to be ready (48 minutes in total for a 15-20 min order) and when it came I asked if it was even still fresh and  he said back in a rude manor \"it should be fine\".  I left and my food was borderline inedible as it was not even lukewarm and the little crunchy things on my lettuce wraps were stale from sitting out so long. 
I received an old meal and super rude and super slow take out service. I have never experienced this dining in. I will never order take out from the Rampart and Ft Apache location again."}
{"text":"I think this place is better then the ones located near where I live. The waiter always gives up water, ice tea, and coke without us asking a refill all the time. I think he was physic LOL because of it. My wait time was around 20 mins not bad. It was crowed during my visit there. The service I got was good. The food that came out was better then I expected if not better then the California locations."}
{"text":"I will never go to another PF Changs again.  A few months ago my husband picked up take out and it was horrible.  I decided to give it another chance and ordered curbside on Friday.  Our bill was $46 for two meals and two apps.  I got the Vegetable noodles and they had no flavor and tasted like they were frozen and reheated.  My husband even commented that he has eaten at many Asian restaurant and this was the worst food he's ever had.  I'm so disappointed especially because Pf Changs was one of our favorite places a few years ago and the quality of the food has gone down and the price has gone up."}
{"text":"Good Food. Great appetizers, and a nice atmosphere. especially if you get a booth. The wait was a little long for the food but that is probably because it was slightly crowded. they definitely didn't waste any space when it comes to seating. but besides that, the cocktails were great and the food was good. couldn't ask for much more."}
{"text":"I came here last week with a large group I believe 13 of us in total. We came as soon as they opened I believe Wednesday. Well first off they had us wait about 15 minutes before we were seated and like I said we were first ones there but we didn't say anything about waiting we figured they were putting tables together. Right off the bat I have to say that the manager was really rude, he seemed bothered that we were there in a large group, one of my aunt's even tried to joke with him and he shut it down and walked away... I wanted to make a comment on how rude he was because our reason of getting together in such a large group was to boost the spirit of my mother who's battling cancer. We were finally seated and our waitress was awesome I can't recall her name but she was a young girl who kept our drinks full and our needs met... She really was great. I personally had never been there and to me the food was just so so... But my mother likes it. The restrooms were clean along with the restraunt itself... If my mom wanted to go here again I would take her but to go on my own I wouldn't. The manager needs some customer service skills... Don't come off rude... It's not very welcoming."}
{"text":"They now have lunch combos for only $10.  Hip, hip, hooray!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here but the service is 50/50. About half the time you will receive essentially no service and your waiter will disappear."}
{"text":"Great place.  This is probably the 4th or 5th time I have eaten at a PF Changs and I have never been disappointed.  We always start with lettuce wraps which are outstanding.  This time there were 4 of us and we orderred MuShu Pork, Wok Beef, Zodiac Noodles, and Honey Shrimp to go with the lettuce wraps.  All 4 of us thoroughly enjoyed all of the dishes.  We were seated right on time and were treated very well.  This place is consistently very good.  Probably should be 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with P.F. Changs. It is good solid eats but overpriced for \"Chinese\" food. 

This location really plays a big part in my hate part of the relationship. I always order online. Always. Because this location is so slow I won't eat here any other way. Well, I have but I prefer to order online.

The hostess with the mostess is either really nice or really rude. Depending on the day you catch her on. It is not an easy job that she has and I get it but your the first impression on all the customers that walk in the door and more often than not, she turns me off.

So they are so slow, that even though I place my order online I always have to wait past the allotted time scheduled by on-line order. And you will often hear the people at the hostess section complaining about customers. Not something other customers want to hear.

Pass on the eggrolls - they are greasy and bland.
Their sushi and jicama tacos are the business.
And for the most part, I do enjoy their food. And if you ask them to customize your meal, they will."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is hit or miss, but decided to get takeout, because we had company and my husband has to eat gluten free. The quality of the food was not good. The crunchy whatever stuff that's in the lettuce wrap filling are so hard that you seriously could break a tooth on it.  The fried rice had no flavor, and there were mushrooms, and big chunks of broccoli in it.  Yuck !  The egg drop soup even tasted watered down.  Not worth the price at all.  It used to be consistently good. We won't be back again."}
{"text":"I have loved P F  Changs concept for a long time. What is better than Asian fusion? I had not been to this location before, but we tried it the other night and it was not busy. The server told us this was their flagship location.  Happy hour goes until 6:00 and they have a reasonable selection of food too. Drinks were brought out quickly and our server suggested the jicama tacos for appys- they are delicious! They have a little zing to them which is a great accompaniment to the jicama. We enjoyed the ginger chicken and broccoli and the orange peel chicken. They even offer a decent size gluten free menu. I know they are a chain but I do wish their sauces did not contain so much sodium and preservatives. We all drank a ton of water after our meal and still had headaches the next morning.  They have the taste down, now it would be nice if they could make the food fresh."}
{"text":"I love and adore the chicken fried rice, but I could make sweet love all-night-long to the northern-style ribs.  How does one make love to ribs?  XXX is how.  Tender pork ribs, marinated for hours, cooked to perfection in a tangy sauce, and served with a little ramekin of Chinese 5-spice blend.  Pinch a little atop -- munch, munch, munch.  It's pure love.  In fact, it was this location on RAMPART that I first held and caressed these ribs, and it's very memorable.

Order \"off the menu\":
-- The \"real\" Ginger Beer; usually made with Kirin beer and ginger syrup has been replaced with a non-alcoholic one on the menu.  I have them make it with bud light to save a few calories, and still -- so good.
-- The \"Stir-fried Eggplant\" is awesome.  Except they no longer carry it with the minced chicken, only listed with the veggies.  Voila!  Available on request.  Yay!

I took some photos of the ribs and eggplant, and eek - doesn't look so good up-close, so scratch the upload.  Regardless, with the trinity of PF Chang sauces, I slather it all about everything I order...always great.  Like George, I like it HOT and SPICY.

No matter what you order, you get quality -- not authentic, but it is what it is.  Whether you get a Chinese Chicken Salad (adore), Sweet & Sour Soup, or the Lemon Chicken -- it's consistently good.

{"text":"This place's quality and service has really gotten bad.  Not busy and we had to beg for water."}
{"text":"All P.F. Changs are pretty much the same: good food, but slow and/or retarded service.

First, the food. I honestly didn't like the food when I tried it years ago for the first time. Then I discovered that at this restaurant, you really have to order different dishes on every visit to break down what you like and don't like. My favorites are the Crispy Honey Chicken and the Mongolian Beef. Shockingly, I don't eat green beans, but I do like the Crispy Green Beans appetizer. Everything is better when fried! Also, brown rice is an option without an extra charge, yay!

As I mentioned, service is slow. If you plan to dine in, be prepared to stay for like an hour and a half. If you need to get in and out quick, you MIGHT have better luck with take out/curbside pickup. Remember, I said MIGHT. This location can get pretty crowded for dinner on a weekday. We came here during the middle of the week. The parking lot was packed and although there were many people waiting to get a table, we were seated within a few minutes.

What really annoyed me was my last visit. I called in my order for curbside pickup. 30 minutes later, I parked in one of the curbside parking stalls. I waited about 5 minutes before an employee ran to my car. She greeted me, repeated my order back to me, I confirmed it, and gave her my debit card. A few minutes later, I got my food and started to drive back home. As I was at a red light, I peeked in the brown paper bag and noticed that they forgot to give me my 2 boxes of white rice. Grrr! Pulled a U-Turn and drove back. Luckily, I wasn't too far away at the time. When I got there, I didn't see any employees in the curbside area, so I called the restaurant. Hey, they are the ones that forgot my rice, so I wasn't going to get out of my car! The first person I talked to transferred me to the hostess. The hostess then transferred me to take out. Then take out transferred me to curbside. WTF? I told the last guy on the phone that I was missing my 2 boxes of white rice, I drove back and was parked in a curbside stall and asked if someone could run it to my car. He said \"Let me see what my manager can do for you\" and put me on hold. A few minutes later, dial tone. Really?? Right when that happened, the curbside employee who helped me earlier came to my window and said \"Was something wrong, ma'am?\" I told her I was missing my rice, she apologized, and  finally gave it to me. 

Lesson learned. Always check your bag before you leave. But still. This isn't McDonalds for crying out loud! Its their job to make sure all the orders are correct! I did call back later that night to speak with a manager about how unorganized they were and how much of my time they wasted because they couldn't do something simple as double checking the orders. She apologized and did send me a $10 gift card in the mail, which was nice of her. I do like the food here so I will be back. Hopefully things will run more smoothly the next time around."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm from the Philippines, so basically our foods there are mainly Chinese inspired..we have stir fried noodles (pansit), egg rolls (lumpia) and some other dishes that are just yummy! 
Well I love to cook! It's my passion ?
For the many 'Chinese kind of' restaurants I've tried, I love them, well you cannot really compare them to the authentic Asian dishes, but at least they try. And of course, they have to have the western taste mix..
As far as the  taste, food presentation, cleanliness and good service. This place is pretty good! I love it here! 
We normally come here with my inlaws or friends during weekends. I always order same thing -wanton soup, grilled salmon and lettuce wrap. A soup and a rice should always be there to complete my meal! lolHubby always tease me, because Filipinos cannot live without rice and 'sabaw' (soup) which I admit! Haha 
I love the ambiance of this place, it's peaceful..I mean I don't like to eat in a noisy restaurant. The place is well kept. And the food service is great! 
keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Make a reservation. We eat here almost every time we are in Vegas. Food is consistently good. Service is good most of the time. I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. 

Watch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, $9 margarita. Very good though...."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas in March for a convention, I had one of the best experiences the whole time I was there. Robin the bartender was the best in Vegas. I tended Bar in Washington DC for 20 years and never met a bartender as good as Robin. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Besides the LaJolla, CA (UTC) location, this is by far one of the better PF Changs. YUMMY! I'm hoping it's not because it's still only 8 months old. (Crossing my fingers)! All the others that I've tried have been way too generous with the sodium in their cooking. Everything is prepared and spiced perfectly! The decorations and design are a bit more subtle than other locations, and the servers and rest of the staff are great. 

Note: I know they advertise that they don't use MSG in their cooking. But my mother had a very allergic reaction; which she gets specifically to large amounts of MSG intake. Maybe that's why the food is so AWESOME!!! (Oh yeah, mom is fine. It's one of those reactions that trigger multiple trips to the restroom before we can pull out of the parking lot. No worries. She thought the food rocked too.)"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the upstairs bartender that was working on 4/13. 

So we had tickets that night for the Beatles LOVE show over at the Mirage, but we wanted to eat first. We tried a few places but they all had a two hour wait. We go over to PF Changs which had an hour wait so we put our name down. Out of nowhere a bartender comes downstairs and says there are seats at the upstairs bar we can sit at, and we wouldn't need to wait. SCORE!! That's what I call being in the right place at the right time.... We head upstairs and order our drinks plus our food. The bartender was very nice and had great customer service. We were able to have a few drinks, eat, and still make it to our show on time. 

I give this bartender 5 stars.... And we gave him a hefty tip! The flying kiss in my profile picture is for people like him."}
{"text":"Is this place a restaurant or a chill club? They have executed both effectively. We came here after beefing up our wine racks, across the parking lot at BevMo. And after standing in from the the menu board at Paradise Bakery and thinking everything on the menu sound bland and boring something fierce. And going to PFC was definitely a wise choice. Lettuce wraps are the way to start any meal here. They are out of this world. I ordered the ma po something-or-other, spicy. Wonderful! And plentiful enough to make two meals. The only thing that would have made it better is if the broccoli was in bite-size pieces. Perhaps that's why we have knives."}
{"text":"Been to one Chang's, been to them all. Except for the specific decor, they're a chain. My sister was in town on business recently and had a craving for Chang's so we stopped here before shopping across the street. We each tried their new Pad Thai dish with chicken and shrimp...meh, ho hum. Trust me, stick with their tried-and-true dishes. My faves are the Dan Dan Noodles, the Crispy Honey Chicken, and Singapore Street Noodles. The crab wontons, chicken lettuce wraps, and dynamite shrimp are my favorite appetizers. They also make a mean key lime martini. 

This location is good -- it's on the SWC of Camelback and Scottsdale Rds, across from Scottsdale Fashion Square near the waterfront. Inside and outside seating are available."}
{"text":"Food is the same as any other PF Changs. Service sucks. Our waitress took our order and never came back. Never saw her walking around helping others. Never refilled our drinks.  It was really odd. Also two tables near us which had left were not cleaned for our entire lunch. It wasn't crowded and their were several staff. Not sure what the issue is here."}
{"text":"We went to PFChangs! I'm giving this PFChangs a 5 star review because everything was great: our server, James, the food, the value, the timing, the atmosphere. 

We ordered the meal for 2 which is $40 and comes with a cup of soup for each, 2 entrees, an app to share, and a tiny dessert to share! Everything tasted great! Not enough sauce on the entrees tho, so today the leftovers with rice were a little dry. We got two cups of the wonton soup that is always good and has a couple shrimp in it... We got Changs spicy chicken, and Mongolian beef, also the chicken lettuce wraps. And then the chocolate wonton for dessert. Taste was good! Oh we also got a side of the spicy green beans cause I always think it is weird if there is no veg. They don't do the shtick with the little sauces on the table anymore so you can't feel like a chemist anymore or with you had steampunk safety goggles on.

Music was weird! It was quite modern annoying indie alternative music, which I often like, but thought an odd choice for this restaurant. ??? The dessert was two tiny wonton chocolate things lol. It was fine... But the two came on one plate and they brought an extra plate... So we had two decent size plates for two folded wontons stacked on each other each the size of a stick of gum. Kinda silly but then my husband was like \"I DO want my own plate\" well... Ok! Cause only one plate gets delicious drizzle sauce! What am I even talking about??

PFChangs \"China\" bistro! Go try it!"}
{"text":"Waited much longer than the hostess told us the wait would be, not a big deal. Sat down and was greeted with a very \"chain\" sort of greeting. Ordered tuna appetizer and drinks followed by a dinner order a bit later. Appetizers didn't come before main coarse did. I had the spicy chicken and it tasted good but like something I could make with a Safeway card and an oven - nothing special. The waiter, who knows what their name is because the bill is illegible, apologized for the appetizer being late and said he would comp it, great, thanks. The kids were tired and we needed to go so we asked for a check. Next thing I know. that  \"free\" appetizer was gone, even though we hadn't finished more than half of it. Why in the heck would a server take away uneaten food without talking with the customer about their intentions with the food. Mediocre food + horrible service = bad review. There are plenty of places to choose from in Scottsdale, save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great service. Food is always good. One of our four orders came out wrong. Not a big deal. Without us having to say anything other than it came out wrong the manager immediately took care of it. Brought the new one out as soon as it was finished and took it off the bill. Server was great as well and offered a free dessert. That's how to take care of customers. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday evening with a group of friends and was able to find parking in the lot behind the AMC, which they validate. Still had to pay a couple dollars because I guess we stayed longer than what they cover. 

Our server was a super friendly, younger gentleman - maybe a college student? He did a great job with our party of 7 and was knowledgeable, attentive and kind throughout our dining experience. Made sure we got to take advantage of their happy hour specials. All our main entrees came out together and everyone was pleased with their dishes. 

Since this is a chain restaurant, you pretty much know what to expect in terms of the menu. What can vary from location to location is the service and ours was great this visit! Would definitely return."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to eat. But the last 5 years have turned me off to coming here. I always feel a little sick after eating here. Not sure if it's the oils used to prep the food or what. 
Came here to eat with family and the service was great. Chicken lettuce wraps tasted great. All the dishes came out quickly. The pad thai was meh, my bf didn't like the Mongolian beef. 
Our server was very nice and attentive. 
But literally 5 mins after finishing our meal I could feel my stomach turn. I can't come back here again. 
Our server was 5 stars, but the food is so bad."}
{"text":"This location is amazing! The staff is so nice and accommodating. Our server Brendan was impeccable and gave speedy service with a great touch of hospitality. I will be recommending this location to family and friends! Be sure to check out the happy hour menu"}
{"text":"We've been there for sit down dining but tonight it was take out. Big mistake. Pad Thai was lousy, tasteless and very under sauced. Egg rolls were saughy and the fried rice had huge chunks of vegetables, ridiculous big. In Phoenix it's a Chinese food wasteland so with PF Chang sucking like this, we're  very disappointed.  Not sure we'll try it again."}
{"text":"This is about P.F. Chang's take out service. Generally, I love P.F. Chang's. I received gift cards for P.F. Chang's for Christmas, and we decided to pick up our food and have a quiet night in using the gift card. If you do the same, CHECK YOUR BAG YOURSELF before paying for it. We brought home Lettuce Wraps - and they left out the lettuce. We asked for the food to be ready at 3:30 PM, and by the time we got it home, NONE of it was hot - or even warm. It WAS sitting on the bar when we picked it up and I had to wait for the bartender to check me out. I'm not sure how long it sat on the counter, but you might be better ordering while there or you run the same risk. Beef a la Sechuan is very very spicy - too spicy to enjoy - and it wasn't always that way. As a long time fan of other locations, I am disappointed with the Mesa - Superstition location and I'm not sure I will ever return. Really disappointed that this one situation has ruined our feelings about P.F. Chang's."}
{"text":"I must be the only person in Phx never to eat here. Ok, so we did finally go before Phantom. Mixed reviews here.I love Peiwei so assumed I would love this place too.I did not.  I am at a crossroad as to give it a good review or a bad so I  will just say what happened noting what I liked an disliked about the experience.  We got here at around 4:45 which was good because by the time we left the place had a long wait and was packed. The first thing I did not like is the way it is set up. Tables all over the place with no spaces to walk in between. It was very odd. I found this very annoying and I am sure a nightmare for older or handicapped people. It seemed very weird for me to be banging into people's elbows as I walked by their tables. The service was very good at the start but died when they got busy. Although the manager here was great, printing out nutritional value menu for me and another waitress walked me to the bathroom. Our server was ok, seemed a little ditzy but was ok, not great just, OK. I ordered a wedge salad with chicken and got a wedge salad with no chicken. I ate it all before I realized it. (I know don't ask. I guess I was starving and the blood drained from my brain) I did not want the waitress to think I was trying to scam her. I pointed it out and said it was Ok since I did not point it out sooner and after all I did eat it all but just an FYI for the cook. She did not seem very concerned and I think this is a huge mistake for a place to make. They did not comp the bill the difference which I think they should have even though I said it was ok.( The salad was good but there was a three dollar difference in price) I worked in the restaurant business for years and comping the difference would  have been the very  least I would have done. I also thought that was a huge mistake on the part of the cook and server in an expensive place such as this. . Of course, I do take partial responsibility for not noticing it until it was to late and the food was good. The dressings make it. I had these awesome cucumbers too that tasted nice.  Again, it is their sauce. My friend had a noodle dish that was very tasty too. The service took along time to get the food to us though and the place was horribly noisy. Yikes! Two large parties sandwiched around us. One where children kept clinking knives on the glasses non stop and the other table had people clapping every minute about something or another. This was horrid! I like a quieter dining experience please.The last straw was when a couple with 2 very naughty kids sat down in back of us and I got wacked in the back of the head with the kid's paper that he kept flinging around and hitting his father with.A father that did not do one thing to discipline the kid.  Please if you are bringing out the kids leave if they are misbehaving. All in all the experience was not horrible but not great either. I might go back for lunch and try some more of their dishes. However, to be honest there are other good restaurants in town that are better suited to me. Since I love Peiwei i will eat there more often and skip this much pricier option."}
{"text":"Here for a quick bite with coworkers who had a hankering for some wonton soup to help them get over a pesky cold. We shared a combination dinner with wonton soup and lettuce wraps to start, Mongolian Beef and garlic noodles. It was plenty for the three of us to share.

The food was good and the service was superb. Everyone was really pleasant and the manager even came by to make sure we were enjoying our meal and take our dessert order. We ended our meal with the salted caramel cake and we had plenty of food to take home as leftovers."}
{"text":"Gift certificates often take me places I don't normally go. This is the case for my most recent visit to PF Chang's. I have been on a number of occasions when I worked near one years ago and they had pretty reasonably priced lunches. 

I remember that I always enjoyed the garlic noodles so I knew this was a must on our most recent visit. We also got some spicy chicken, eggplant, garlic spinach and fried rice. The food was ok and my memory hadn't failed me. The garlic noodles were again my favorite dish. The chicken and eggplant were entirely too sweet for my taste. The fried rice was ok and so was the spinach, but I was hoping for more garlic flavor. I wish I only ordered the garlic noodles and if I ever come again (which isn't likely) I would stick with them again. 

Service was ok. Our server was attentive at first but when a large party came in refills became a little more infrequent. He apologized and tried to be as attentive as possible, which we appreciated. 

Overall, it's a chain, so they are all pretty standard and this one doesn't stand out in any way either negatively or positively."}
{"text":"my very first  3 star review!

I had an early dinner with My Mom at Chang-A-Langs. It was good as usual. I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants but this is one I am willing to go to. We got the Dinner for two for $39.99. We split it between 4 people so it's a lot of food. Here is what we got. 

Choice of Soup (pick 2)

1 hot and sour
1 egg drop - not good. 

Appetizer (pick 1)

Lettuce Wraps - Yummmmmmmy!

Choice  of entree (pick 2)

We chose Mongolian Beef and Honey seared Chicken. 

The mongolian beef was excellent. I didn't try the chicken but have had it in the past and it's a safe choice. If you take the kiddos I suggest that for them. 

Choice of 2 mini desserts. If it's your birthday you get a free one so we picked a total of 3. 

Carrot Cake - Ok
Tiramisu - To Die For!
Chocolate Cake with Raspberry sauce - Good.

The service was good. No problems at all but it also was 4:00pm so it was near dead in there."}
{"text":"Service: 
We had a large group that included about 20 people so I expected service to be slow. However, this was ridiculous. We were seated at 7 but my friend did not get her food for another 2 hours while others were getting their bills/checks. She spoke to the manager, he was dismissive, but her food was free. Our waiter Marvin was polite and apologetic. 

Vegetarian:
They have about 5 options for vegetarian entrees and I ordered the Ma Po Tofu. The texture was soft on the the inside and chewy on the outside. It was probably typical of tofu but I did not enjoy it and sent it back to the kitchen. I replaced it with a vegetable fried rice, and they brought it in a Togo container. I had spring rolls as my appetizer. The rice and rolls were mediocre and tasted like they would at any \"Chinese\" restaurant. My total was 15.

Meat:
There were no complaints or rave reviews from the table. My friend got the chicken lo mein and she said there was more chicken than she expected and she enjoyed the flavor. Her total was 13. 

Overall: 
We were there for a birthday dinner and the birthdsy-girl had a good time. They refrigerated her cupcakes and they don't sing Happy birthday. That said, I was generally disappointed"}
{"text":"One of your hostess said in a rude tone that there were no booths available when I asked if we could have one. As me and my girlfriend walked to our seats that the hostess seated us at we saw 4 open booths and at 5 of the occupied booths there were 2 people seating in them. As my girlfriend and I were waiting for our food we witnessed the same hostess sit a party of 2 in a booth. It was not that long ago that we asked for a booth so I was surprised to see that. The hostess pretty much ruined my experience here. The pan-fried pork dumplings were good but there's a tastier and cheaper option at a Chinese restaurant called Golden Valley. I also ordered then lo mien which was just as good as the lo mien I had at Golden Valley which is just as good and you get more for a lesser price. I came here around 8pm. If it wasn't for the waitress this place would probably be given a 4."}
{"text":"This PF Chang's is the best in Las Vegas. Their food  tastes substantially better than the others I've dined at in the city. Try the chicken lettuce wraps, the sea bass entree, and definitely banana rolls for dessert. Those dishes are all equally amazing!! I find myself craving that banana roll dessert all the time now.  Yum"}
{"text":"Upscale Chinese Food and restaurant with modern decor and Foo Foo furniture and people. 

This does not necessarily equate to good authentic chinese food. 

Decide if you want to go here to eat the food  or to be seen at the happening place to be.

This is with out a doubt white man's chinese food with a splash of place to be seen.

Most of my favorite Chinese restaurants are of sketchy decor but with great food. In fact most of the authentic chinese restaurants have had poor health infractions or almost shut down for health violations. 

We ate family style and shared the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce,  Singapore Street Noodles,  Pepper Steak and Cantonese Lemon Chicken. 

The Shrimp with Lobster Sauce is actually better at their sister restaurant Pei Wei and less expensive. The Singapore Street Noodles did not have the curry taste that I was expecting and the noodles could have been more crisp but were soggy. The Pepper Beef actually had some kick to it and maybe a little too much.

Our server Teisha was excellent and was very accomodating. 

The main reason we went here is because we had a gift card. 

Once you have had authentic chinese food made by your parents or grandparents and then have white man's chinese food you will always shake your head at the difference."}
{"text":"This place was pretty nice. I loved the atmosphere, great date location. The service was on point. The food was good, I wish they served more rice with the main entrée but it was still good. I had some champagne there that was amazing. Kind of pricey here but not too bad. I'd come here again. :)"}
{"text":"I know, I know.... It's a chain.  I hate chains. But... lets look at my record.  5 Stars for Del Friscos.  5 + \"Regular\" status at Ruth's Chris Uptown.  Lotta love for Showmars.  OK Mr. Foodie Doofus.  Get over your bad self...

I'll just come out and say it.  I really, really like PF Changs!  This food has nice flavors.  Heck even the texture, yes texture, of the Hot and Sour Soup makes me happy.  My favorite dish by far is the Mongolian Beef.  Such a simple thing of sliced steak, green onions and a brown sauce.  But its just so darn good!  The steak is always tender and just tastes yummy with its sort of wok seared edges.  Hard to even describe.  Hell, they may even deep fry the stuff for all I know.  Whatever...  Keep it up!

Service is always fast, friendly and efficient too.  This is a place where it's very clear they spend a lot of time on training and it shows.

See you there soon.  Did I mention I hate chains?"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on our last night of our father/son trip to Las Vegas.  We were absolutely delighted.  The staff is super-friendly, helpful, and attentive.  We happened to get a great table on the top level at the window overlooking the strip, we couldn't have asked for better.  

The food was amazing.  We ordered the pan-fried shrimp dumplings, sesame chicken, and vegetable lo mein.  We loved all of it.  And when we got the bill at the end, we were shocked at how reasonable it was.  I believe I said \"That's much less than it needs to be for how good it was.\"  At the end of the meal, my father and I were both remarking on how impressed we were with the whole experience.  It was a perfect cap to our wonderful trip."}
{"text":"It's PF Changs.  It's generic Americanized asian food.  What else is there to say."}
{"text":"Location: by Northlake mall, clean
Parking: large private lot
Customer Service: great 
Style: family style dining 
Food: Asian fusion; great, something different.  Order a lot of different dishes and share.
Atmosphere:  dim lights in the evening, get a booth and have an intimate dinner date.
Happy Hour: 3-6pm, under $6
Join their rewards program!"}
{"text":"Everything was extremely salty. The $25 sea bass was extremely salty. Sauce had no thickening, dish had no garnish. What a waste of quality ingredient. The side order dish had no seasoning but soy sauce."}
{"text":"This was only my second time at a PF Chang's and I was really impressed by the quality and quantity this time around. While I don't generally come to this franchise because there is usually a plethora of cheaper, closer and more authentic Asian restaurants (especially in NYC), i will say that this is a serviceable alternative. A group of seven of us came through on Thursday evening.

I unfortunately don't recall what everyone ordered but a few standout items were: the honey glazed chicken, the Korean pork lettuce wrap appetizer, and the original PF Chang's chicken lettuce wrap appetizer. Also ordered were a Malaysian vegetable dish and a poke bowl. We had white rice with all of the dishes.

The total came out to about $100 pre-tax and tip which is great for 7 people. Service was fine, especially considering how busy the restaurant was. No complaints there. Very satisfied with my visit."}
{"text":"As you entree no one greets you. The front desk girl was on the phone but yet she obviously did not look up to even say hi, nod and 5 employees passed by and nothing. I was just there, no acknowledgment, no hello, I'll be with you...nothing!! 
Finally got sat down, ordered food, once I got the food I was ignored. Waitress did not come around at all. I needed more ginger for my sushi and YEP I finished my sushi without ginger because no one came to serve me. 
I had to flag someone down for my bill. No Bueno! Horrible service."}
{"text":"Their shrimp dishes are great- but you can get the same meal at any of their locations.  Drinks are average.  Service has always been good, so for that I'd pick this PF Changs over others.  Who am I kidding?  I just love Kierland Commons!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to the strip for some fun and excitement, my hunger brings me to this place.  The food is outstanding and the staff is very friendly. Short wait times for service. Excellent choice of entrées."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Our server Kris, made our dinning experience so wonderful! He was so funny and also has great hair! Thank you Kris for being so awesome :)"}
{"text":"I've been to PF Chang's before, but this experience was excellent with our extremely kind server & the delicious food! 
We ordered the shrimp potstickers pan fried and the shrimp fried rice. (Definitely were shrimp'd out by the end ) 
The potstickers were crunchy with a ton of flavor and the same goes for the rice. It was so good that we hope the food will be just as delicious here in San Jose. 
Our service was excellent too! Don't know the woman's name, but she saw we had a baby & offered anything we needed for the baby, she'd bring it for us! 
My husband and I were very pleased with our visit at this specific PF Chang's. We will definitely come again when we go back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Vegas trip back in late 2007 and the food was really, really good.  The sauces that they mix at the table is pretty cool and the food was just excellent.

This was the first PF Changs Restaurant I'd ever been to and since then I have been back twice to the local one here in Houston.

The staff was friendly and nice.  Couldn't be happier with this place."}
{"text":"As other reviewers mentioned, this is a big chain restaurant down the street and me and my wife love coming here. We like the salt and pepper calamari and the sea bass entry.  We like the open space and the outside patio., when the weather permits. The staff is very friendly and it is nice that  even it is a big chain down the street the hostess remembers we like to seat in a boot and the servers know what we like to order.
We recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first and last visit to this location.  We were seated immediately for dinner and our order taken within 5 minutes.  However, we waited at least 45 minutes for our good.  Server kept stopping by our table stating \"5 more minutes\"... when our meals finally did arrive, the lemon chicken was a small portion and lukewarm.  The so called lemon sauce (on the side) was very watery with just a slight hint of lemon flavor.  The vegetable low mein was a nice size portion and served hot but it had absolutely no flavor....just plain noodles with a few veggies thrown in.  It looked a lot better than it tasted.  They were also out of green tea.  How can a chinese restaurant be out of green tea??  Unacceptable!!!!  Very disappointed.  Needless to say, we won't be back......"}
{"text":"For those who demand their Chinese authentic get some mao tai and a book of Li Po's poetry and drink with the moon and your shadow. For those who don't, have a nice Japanese Sapporo with your mixed Asian grille style. No complaints by me, this is pretty good fare for the weak of auricle and ventricle when it comes to Chinese. If I needed an MSG hit and couldn't find a good Cantonese place, this would do. Its like when you hit a city you don't know after riding cross country next to sweaty pock faced woman in gray sweats that say (ARMY) on them and suffer under her wheezing, sighing, and sneezing, not to mention guffawing at a People magazine. You need a safe home to eat dinner, some safe, relatively hygenic food. So you hit the Irish pub and rinse old scabface out of your mind with a few pints of Guinness and a shepherd's pie. PF Chang is sort of upscale comfort food."}
{"text":"I really recommend the Kung Pao Roll and the Shrimp Tempura roll. I always ask for a side of dynamite sauce to give it an extra kick. I've been to this location about 5-6 times and it does need to improve on their cleanliness. A couple of the times I went, the chairs had some grease from previous customers and the floor was not swept. Overall, the food is addicting and besides the sushi we also order the orange peel shrimp with a side of brown rice."}
{"text":"The calamari here is my favorite!  I love PF Chang's but just has a so-so experience here.  We came early for dinner, were seated right away.  Got the calamari, always awesome.  And ordered the salt and pepper prawns and mahi mah.  My friend's prawns came, I assumed mine was coming soon.  10 minutes later I asked about my meal and the waiter had forgot.  He apologized and rushed to get the order in.  My friend shared his meal.  And we shared mine as well, after it came.  The food was great.  This has been the only time I've had bad service at PF Chang's, but it was the first time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't openly announce my affection for PF Chang's.  Growing up in the San Gabriel valley surrounded by real Chinese food I sometimes wonder if I'm allowed to enjoy this candy-like addicting concoction they serve here as food.  Proper or not, I like PF Chang's!  Although it's not the best food, it's tasty and it sure makes my mouth happy.

I mentioned in my previous blog that mom was visiting from Korea.  We went to Vegas and stayed at Planet Hollywood.  While my hubby was playing poker, mom and I decided to eat at the PF Chang's located inside the hotel.  It is here that my mom's obsession with this restaurant starts all over again. 

We always order the Garlic Noodles.  We LOVE this dish.  We also ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps that we enjoy.  We sat out in the patio and blissfully soaked in the fair weather while munching happily on our lunch.  Even our strange & annoying server who kept complaining to us about her other table of customers and kept trying to overcharge us (I had to tell her to fix our bill twice) couldn't ruin our meal."}
{"text":"For these prices and the decor, I expected more. I put off coming here because the reviews I was reading really dampened my desire to give Chang's a shot. One afternoon after shopping at Concord Mills, my partner and I were starving. We wanted to go to Cowfish, but being that I already drove from University to Pineville then back up to Concord in less than two hours, I did not want to drive to SouthPark. So P.F. Changs won out. It was packed on a Sunday afternoon, but we were seated quickly. 

The 6 pieces of dynamite shrimp appetizer came out quickly, but there was a very long wait for the rest of our food. The server kept apologizing, and so did another individual, a manager perhaps.

After our meals finally made it to the table, we quickly realized that comparable food could be had at a Chinese buffet. I will say that the lo mein was the best choice of out all. But not enough that I need to return or pay over $70 for. My lobster fried rice was also a good choice, but it was one of those one and done dishes. I've eaten at too many places around town whose food selections make me want to return as soon as possible. 

Not the case here. I assume most of the patrons wouldn't be caught dead at a Chinese buffet, and I don't blame them. But I'm not averse to one, so when I want Americanized Chinese, I'll go there for 1/3 of the price and absolutely no wait."}
