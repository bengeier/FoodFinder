{"text":"My husband and I had visited this restaurant after noticing the small non-descript sign at the main intersection on Clocktower Ave. and O'Neill Road. We had the house sake (hot) and a Sake Sanfranokyo (I hope I had spelled that correctly, my bad) to drink. The sake was fragrant and light, while the Sanfranokyo was delicious with a lychee juice base. The friendly waitress had recommended the Shinjuku maki to us and it was very tasty. The portions are the right size but a bit on the pricy side. Love the trendy ambience!"}
{"text":"If you value your money, time and taste buds never go to this place. It is way over priced. The sushi, salmon teriyaki and udon noodles tastes TERRIBLE, very bland. DO NOT go here, 1 star is even generous."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor are great, but the food not as good as I expected. I would expect better quality in this price range."}
{"text":"Dinner was great. The food was fresh and tasty. Service was fast and friendly. I would come back. ;) They also have 4 big screen tv's and we watched the Jays play!  The only con is that I wish the rice was served hotter and they brought us bowls instead of plates, otherwise it was very good."}
{"text":"Ordered a chirashi. Worst I've ever had. Rice was warm, and unseasoned. Sashimi on the rice was sliced pretty thin and the selection was nothing special. Regular tuna, salmon, tamago, imitation crab.  The food is underwhelming and overpriced. I would not go back."}
{"text":"I was a part of the 20 person table that Rebecca S wrote about in her review, and everything she wrote was accurate. It's inexcusable to know ahead of time that a large group is coming and be unprepared for it - our server actually told us \"I wish your group had come yesterday, we were less busy yesterday and could have given you better service!\" And this was on a night when the restaurant was 40% full. I can't imagine what the service would be like if the restaurant were 100% full."}
{"text":"Located across the way from BierMrkt at shops of Don Mills. Any time I go to a new Japanese restaurant I go with the chirashi ($16) to get a good feel for the freshness of the fish.   The verdict is the fish is decent, I have had better, unfortunately in a crowded sushi market they dont do enough to have me come back on a regular basis.   My friend had the chicken udon and said that was much better so I will come back one more time and give that a shot to see if that changes my mind."}
{"text":"Had a late dinner with friends tonight. Not very busy given the location on a Friday. It did not have a lounge atmosphere.    I had the avocado salad which was served with iceberg lettuce. I finished but did not particularly enjoy. The spicy salmon was decent. And my pork katsu (sp?) lacked a bit flavour. The food did not meet expectations given the price and location.    The service was excellent.  Very polite and friendly staff. The great waitress is keeping them up at 2 stars."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located at the Shops at Don Mills; a blooming area. My friend told me about this restaurant and I took it upon myself to try it because #ILOVESUSHI ! The menu is vegetarian, gluten free and health/diet watcher friendly. There are symbols which indicates to you which items are vegetarian or low carbs etc. One of my friends was not eating meat for religious reasons that month so this was very useful to us.  Now time for the food break down:  [x] Shinjuku roll - this roll was topped with torched white tuna and had drizzles of unagi sauce. It was crispy and delicous! 5/5  [x] Assorted Sashimi platter - i've got to say, it was the freshest fish i've ever eaten; served beautifully on a block of ice which keeps the fish nice and cool.Â  A must order. 5/5  [x] Drinks :Sake Bellini and Chinatown cold tea. I definitely recommend trying one of these drinks. 5/5  we ordered some other dishes which were great but these were my favourite. Ill definitely be back to try more and update my review.   The atmosphere is very clean and modern. The most intriguing part was that aside from sport channels, they had anime playing on one of their tvs LOL.  As for service, our server was very professional and polite. Excellent all around.   I hope I'm not being too generous but I had a great time and I believe it deserves my 5 star review."}
{"text":"If you enjoy paying high prices for very little food this is the place for you. Dishes were visually unique and interesting, however they weren't executed for taste."}
{"text":"Food was great Japanese cuisine and reasonably price. Place wasn't very busy but service was great and very quick ."}
{"text":"Meal was great service was even better. I had the tempura dinner which was very good. I was with the extended family (all filipino) so we had sushi b4....by the looks on their faces a good time was had by all. Pretty expensive but we'll worth it."}
{"text":"The $14 curry chicken ramen is below grade. The ramen texture can not compare to any authentic Japanese ramen restaurants in downtown Toronto.  The $45 YoYoGi Sushi & Sashimi, 10 pcs assorted sushi, 10 pcs assorted sashimi is not worth it. The salmon, tuna, hamachi & octopus sashimi's quality are just ok. The only good quality is the kazunoko saba sashimi.   The $11 Chipotle Karage - fries chicken bites is over priced and the chicken bites are too soft and greasy.  Customer services and interior design are good.  I found the food prices are over priced, I think the Canadian dollar decline may have an affect on the food pricing."}
{"text":"There is not a better place for sushi, tempura and deep fried banana in town. Just perfect. Atmosphere, food, price, service.. . Amazing! I strongly recommend this place. (And no,  I'm not a relative or friend of the owner)"}
{"text":"So I just left the restaurant just now and i needed to write a review as fast as possible. This restaurant does not live up to the name. The sushi is made very foolishly and clumsy our spider maki fell apart at the seams. Also the service is a huge thing for me. As formerly being in the customer service industry for sometime, I have to say the customer service is horrible. It is super slow. The owner and the servers really cater to non-Asian customers. My boyfriend and I are Asian and we received not any of the the treatment that other customers had received around us. When others received dishes slowly, they were notified that someone called in sick and they will be served shortly. While we were sitting there... No one was serving us or talked to us at all. Even I saw the owner give business cards to non-Asian customers and did not even receive a glimpse of a look to see if we are okay.   Especially if we are getting a 10 piece sashimi 6 pieces of sushi, one roll and one appetizer for $105... And my boyfriend went specifically for oysters and were sold out... The service was horrible, the food was mediocre.   I would never go back and I am so furious I had to write as soon as we walked out the door . I wanted to write this review for my own conscience to let others know of this experience. Completely we are disappointed."}
{"text":"We are fans of Kabuki and have come here several times!!  It is a bit on the higher priced side but we enjoy the freshness of food, service, ambiance and creative drinks.  I see a number of reviews and are poor but frankly for the various times we have been to Kabuki, that has absolutely never been our experience.  Our 11 year old loves this place so much, she wanted to go there for her birthday supper which happens to fall on Valentine's day.  Even though it was a busy night, they did a great job and the food was wonderful.  Sushi Pizza app is one of our favorites!!  We will be back Kabuki!!  Thanks for the nice night!!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Wednesday evening. We were there from 5:30 - 9pm, and there were only two other tables the entire evening. It is a relatively new restaurant so it will hopefully get busier soon.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers, rolls, and the black cod to share. Wish they had spaced out the timing of the food - everything came out minutes apart. Portions were big, but quality was similar to an AYCE joint. The salmon tataki salad came with cheap lettuce on the bottom, which didn't go very well with the dish. Black cod was a tad overdone and wasn't as buttery as I would have liked. Ran out of uni which was pretty disappointing. I equate the authenticity of a sushi restaurant with their quality and availability of uni.  The decor was pretty casual. I had expected something a bit more fancy given the location and the \"sushi lounge\" name. They had the unisex single stall washrooms which were clean and modern - likely because of the light traffic of the restaurant.  Service was good - our server was friendly and attentive. Food was reasonably priced for the portions and location, but food left something to be desired."}
{"text":"Didn't really like this restaurant when it was at Bayview Village, except for the fact that if I felt like Japanese, that would be the place to go. Now, the same has happened to Shops on Don Mills. If you feel like Japanese within this compound, then this is it.  Having said that, it's an ok place for sushi. It's got your usual sushi and sashimi, and those specialty rolls with crazy sauces. It's got the fried stuff, and noodles and rice. Service can be a hit or miss. One time, my parents and I went on a Wednesday night early on, and we had a great waitress. Pan to a Saturday night, our waitress (not the same one), continually forgot my drink orders, had to ask for chopsticks three times, and was no where to be found. Reservations are a must as it was packed, packed.   I find that the Management chintzed out on waiters for a busy Saturday night just to save money (?) By the way, it's not that cheap. Unless you order a glass of their house wine, a glass of wine will set you back $16 or $18 for an 8oz. That pricing is reserved for Four Seasons dining, thank you very much.  Go if you must, and for convenience of location, but really, there are so many other better Japanese restaurants, if that's what you're feeling like."}
{"text":"Had initially come down to Shops at Don Mills to hit up another restaurant, but it was like an hour wait so we walked over to Kabuki. I've got to say, the overall experience was quite good!!   First off, the decor was elegant. Simple ambiance paired with unique pieces made this a welcoming environment without being too formal or pretentious. With 4 televisions, 3 were playing the hockey game while 1 played non-stop anime! (Which is cool!) Lol.  Had to wait a little while at the front before we got seated as they didn't seem to have a host, but were quickly seated when someone finally came by. We decided on drinks (Sake Sangria, Sake Bellini, & Chinatown Cold Tea) and dove right into the menu. The drinks were all quite tasty and very different as they were interesting takes on already popular drinks with the addition of sake. With an already wide variety and array of unique Japanese dishes, from sushi and sashimi to hot dishes and noodles, the inclusion of the daily menu will keep you coming back for more.   I ordered the Bluefin Tuna Sashimi off the daily menu and Curry Katsu with Pork. My friends got the Snow Ocean Crab Salad and Chirashi.  Bluefin was amazing, as it was super fresh, sweet and flavourful, and melted in your mouth! A bit pricey at $18 for 3 pieces, but worth it if you really enjoy high quality fish! The Curry Katsu was a nice big portion, with lots of rice. Could be a bit spicier as it was a bit lacking in that respect, but a good whole flavour to the curry.  The Crab Salad was very fresh at a nice portion and the Chirashi was quite good with lots of variety in sashimi.   Overall a nice night out, albeit a bit pricey. Definitely a nice addition to the Shops at Don Mills and worth trying to get the unique dishes that many other Japanese restaurants don't have. Will definitely have to come back some time to try some other things!"}
{"text":"Shinjuku was excellent.  The salmon rolls were average.  The modern rolls are worth the price."}
{"text":"The sushi was okay but I definitely thought the dishes were a bit pricey for what it was. Given the location and the atmosphere I can understand, but I think they need to do something to posh up the experience for it to be worth it. You know how places give you little snacks on the house, edamame, apps, something! Or maybe spruce up the place, to make it more hipster or more \"lounge\". Frankly just looks like regular restaurant. Need to compete with the neighboring Joeys, Bier Markt.   I was told it was oyster night. I mean the oysters were good but didn't seem like it was a good enough deal to be called oyster night (1.25-2.5 each). I ordered the Shinjuku roll ($17), the presentation was great. I like the torched tuna, the burnt flavour was good but the sauce didn't bring out the flavour and bring together all the ingredients. I thought the crispness of the japanese radish was okay but there was way too many in there. The addition of the rice crisps was quite creative but I liked the usual tempera bits more. I don't even want to talk about the cheese... cheese whiz? processed? Dunno when I started being a cheese snob. Overall I thought the roll is different and creative but it didn't hit it for me and definitely not worth the 17!   I agree that they really tried to be creative with their dishes, perhaps I didn't pick the right ones. This place might need another try before I give up on it. The washrooms were nice and the service was great, that's probably what's keeping them afloat! Oh and if you want to watch sports they have four large TVs."}
{"text":"Hmm.... I really wanted to like this place! But, their sushi was ok, the service was ok. It really wasn't anything special. The decor was really nice though, and I find their price was too high for what they are offering, although the restaurant is at Shops and Don Mills, so I guess they were trying to match all the other restaurants.   I really don't have anything good/bad to say about this place, it's very ordinary, nothing special. I had the spicy salmon sashimi ($9) and my husband had the sushi salmon lover ($16) combo. Good thing I wasn't really hungry - the portions were pretty small!  They also charge for tea. I really hate when japanese restaurants charge you for tea. Our server must the owner of the place, I find her trying way too hard to get us to love her. Oh and when I just ordered the appetizer because I really wasn't hungry her reaction - \"oh? just the appetizer? You sure? Just the appetizer?\" YES woman, just the damn appetizer.   I don't think I would come back here, it was just ok."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Kabuki on a Saturday night to host a friend's surprise birthday dinner. They were very accommodating and took a reservation for us the day of after our original dinner plans fell through. Everyone in my party of 12 was super impressed with their dishes, most people opted for the $25 prix fixe, which is seriously a great deal. The female staff member taking care of us was so sweet and amazing. I would totally return if I am in the area and craving sushi! :)"}
{"text":"Great meal there tonight. Food was really fresh and good and the service was even better. What a great local gem. Their salads are great. Fish was really fresh. The chicken katsu that I ordered for my daughter was really good. This type of dish in most sushi restaurants lacks any kind of flavour or attention. It's usually all about the fish. Not this place. The entire meal was fantastic. Going back there again very soon! Chelsea our server was spectacular! Took care of my family like a pro."}
{"text":"This has got to be the most disappointing sushi restaurant i've been to. I had high expectations of this place, since it is big in Los Angeles and also located around shops at don mills, where the food might not be cheap, but the quality is usually at least there. This place definitely did not deliver. We went in a large party of 11 since we all had a craving for some quality sushi. A small group of us in that part ordered some maki rolls together, such as the chipotle lobster roll, a spicy salmon roll, dynamite roll, and spicy scallop roll. this was just as a side dish to start.   this place needs to replace there chefs immediately. The sushi wasn't just not good, it was downright bad. The sushi was so bad, that mac sushi from the mall beats it by a mile. That is unacceptable for a place that is about high quality and is selling the idea of a great quality sushi place. The salmon and rice was not the right freshness, the scallop was also unexcusable. and finally the dynamite roll made everyone confused if they even knew what a dynamite roll actually is.   The sushi however unfortunately was not the only thing that was bad, my friends had also ordered the curry katsu chicken. and udon, as well as beef rice bowl. the curry katsu chicken, as described by my friend was, bad in every way. the chicken was not moist on the inside, and overfried. the curry was not right texture wise. Overall it was a mess, considering the price they charge here, this place has lower quality than buffet All you can eat places.   A Japanese place that can't get right sushi or curry, especially one that is supposed to offer higher quality for its price, this place is definitely on my no recommendations list."}
{"text":"First of all it took an hour for delivery for a salad and sashimi, none of which you need to cook. Their salad was  only spinach and the tuna tataki that I ordered ontop I thought it was a bit expensive and bland for a salad with absolutely no toppings just spinach. The sashimi definitely tasted off and not right. Very disappointing I threw out most of my meal and will never order again. Save your time and money"}
{"text":"The sushi was okay, but for the price, you can definitely find better elsewhere. All your money goes into the location, ambience and decor, and very little into the quality of food.   In fact, we found plastic wrapping in the rainbow roll that we had, and the salmon (which was supposed to be cooked) was undercooked to the point that it was raw in the middle. Good thing we caught it, because it was not sashimi grade and we ate it, there could be possibly parasites in the salmon that weren't killed through cooking.   The service was good, but the price is probably double or triple what you could find elsewhere. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to try something from an upscale location. Absolutely disappointed. If you like thin cuts of sashimi and kale that covers half your plate this place is for you!  I apologize for not taking a pictures. I had a piece of sashimi that was separating as I held it. That did it if it not for the suspicious white raw fish. I just wanted to leave. I will document better. Sorry everyone."}
{"text":"Over price for the food they serve. Server was nice polite. The place was quite. It's only me lunch time which is 12:55 Needless to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat before seeing a movie. I was pretty wowed by Shops of Don Mills altogether, and was happy to find Kabuki. The rolls aren't extraordinary but they're very good, and I'm glad our server recommended the Shinjuku roll because it was one of the most complex and delicious sushi rolls I ever enjoyed. Dinner for four with sake was under $150 and we tore it up with appetizers and rolls."}
{"text":"wtf am I doing here?   Small portions and far overpriced. It seems to be confused as to whether it is a Japanese restaurant or a sports bar.  It is a pretty restaurant, though. I can tell they invested much in the atmostphere.  That being said...cheque, please."}
{"text":"I'm writing this after my second dining experience here. I found it to be really over priced for what it is. I'm pretty certain the over priced menu items are to pay for the decor and ambiance. The sashimi is average, not particularly great considering the prices.  The miso black cod was pretty good and likely the only thing I would order again. Their cocktails are very creative but a bit over priced I found. The waitress really pushed for drink orders and more then once, I found that annoying especially since no one wants to drink and drive.   The waitress came by very often, it felt like she was trying to rush us through our meal and I didn't appreciate that very much. She was also very insistent that we order more alcohol beverages instead of accepting 'no thanks' as the answer.   I would much rather go across the street to Joey's for their rainbow roll I think. They're not as pushy and not as expensive."}
{"text":"Pricey!!! it's expensive and just not that tasty- things on the menu are just okay. Mostly - bland. the chicken teriyaki is just boiled chicken in sauce... not very good some of the rolls are nice if you wanna pay $2 per bite.."}
{"text":"Expensive but worth its price. All the food is light - but filling. Definitely recommend the SHINJUKU MAKI (Avocado, Oshinko, Rice Crispy, Ginger, Cucumber, Habanero Cheese, housemade Unagi sauce, topped with blowtorched White Tuna) which is a wonderful modern take on the traditional maki. The SPICY TUNA SALAD is not your traditional salad at all! Instead, it comes wrapped in paper thin cucumber slices that are bursting with spicy tuna on the inside.  They also offer specialty sashimi that changes daily from Thursday to Sunday. Their sashimi is flown from Japan and the selection changes with the \"catch of the day\" in Japan. We also got an order of that and it was very interesting to taste the unique fish! The sashimi was served on top of an ice bowl.  Their drinks are nothing short of unique! Try the Chinamen Cold Tea which is a must for beer drinkers or their San Fransokyo, a tangy sweet cocktail.  Like your traditional Japanese food? Have no fear, they also serve traditional food if you prefer to keep it simple. Would return back but not it is not my go-to place just because of the price. It is a very nice treat and a wonderful addition into the Shops at Don Mills plaza!"}
{"text":"Went for a date night with the girlfriend as we used to go to the kabuki restaurant at Bayview village, and loved it. We used to like to get the teriyaki chicken bento box.   We were totally surprised walking in. Has free valet parking outside and cool modern decor inside. At the recommendation of the waitress we tried the lobster chipotle role. It was very good, and my girlfriend said it was the best roll we ordered.   Unfortunately this is where the praise for this restaurant ends. We ordered the teriyaki chicken main, but ended up sending it back as it was very dry and did not have a lot of flavour. For $18 I would have expected more.   Both my girlfriend agreed that most of what we ordered ended up being very bland. And not worth the price asked. In review while the decor was nice the food is not worth the prices being asked for sushi.   My girlfriend and I spent over $100 for our meal when we could have gone to any number of all you can eat sushi restaurants and spent $80 and felt we got better bang for buck.   Will not be recommending this restaurant. But willing to try again if changes are made to the menu."}
{"text":"*I was quite surprised to see how spacious and elegant the restaurant was. Simple and unique decor made this a welcoming environment without being too formal or pretentious.  *The price is definitely pricey even for just the regular Japanese food, but I supposed it's explainable by the surrounding restaurants in Shop at Don Mills.   *The service was average and I wasn't too happy to see the host (or manager) spent all her time at this one table - which I assume it's her friends - and ignored us until we asked for the bill.   -Oyster Special - $16/dozen:  The oysters were good but I much prefer the juicy and sweet kinds which I think are P.E.I oysters? I'm no expert so I can't tell where these are from by the looks of it haha. Also you can't call this an oyster night at all lol Each oyster was approx $1.3/each, that ain't a deal.   -Chicken Katsu don - $13 it was good, but not spectacular. To be honest I might be a bit bias here because I never liked chicken katsu don (shocking I know). I mean you get 2/3 of rice and 1/3 of meat & egg, it just not something I would gravitate toward to because there's too much carb. With that said, I appreciate that Kabuki also offers a brown rice and white meat options along with a vegetarian alternative as well.  -Shinjuku roll (avocado, oshinko, rice crispy, topped with torched white tuna, cheese, spicy mayo, unagi sauce) - $17 Since the tuna was blow torched, it brought out the flavorful oils to the surface of the fish and creating a slightly smoky flavor.The oshinko (Japanese pickled radish) was quite a nice addition to help cut through the fattiness from the fish and cheese sauce, and the rice crispy gave some crunch with every bites. Not sure what kind of cheese they used, but looked like those processed cheese wrapped in plastic tbh."}
{"text":"I believe the word we want to say here is pricey. Here's the thing though, some of the items on their menu is pretty darn good. The fact that they can fuse in western style cheese on to a sushi roll and torch it and have it taste pretty darn amazing is beyond my imagination. Gotta try it! The torched dish of sushi is absolutely amazing.   Today I was in a party of 20-25 people and they served us pretty well (unlike the other yelp comments). Green tea is an extra cost $1.50. But there's also a choice of water if you're on a tight budget. Remember that over party of 8 is 18% service charge as well.  I got the spicy salmon poke bowl ($15) and it wasn't spicy at all. I didn't get the flavor of the spicy Mayo so I had to put in the whole wasabi. I did think it was well made though. And I got 3 pieces of seaweed on the side to make my own sushi roll with the sushi brown rice.   Also got the sashimi lunch set ($15) and the sashimi was rested on top of ice and it wasn't too bad. Thick pieces fish - sorta fresh so not too bad. I admired their presentation.   I did think one thing was strange though.. They didn't want to keep the soya sauce on our table... They kept taking it away so I'm not sure why that is... Haha and maybe the servers could have come back a little more often for the water and tea.   Overall I might go back and try another lunch dish. It wasn't as bad as others say on yelp. :)"}
{"text":"Glad to see this gem reopen in their new location. While I will miss the cosy Bayview spot, the new Don Mills location takes it to a whole new level with contemporary decor, a much larger space and an outdoor patio!! All within reach of the same neighbourhood with its trendy upscale crowd.  Food is spectacular with extremely fresh, high quality ingredients, creative menu items and generous portions. Incredible value! Service continues to be fantastic as it always has been.   A place to be enjoyed again and again!  I'll be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write YELP reviews, however, with the service my friends and I received last night, I knew I needed to write something on YELP to help others reconsider this restaurant option and save 3 hours of their life. I would give 2 stars for the food, and -1 stars for the service. I had made reservations under my name for 20 people 1 MONTH in advance prior to coming into the restaurant. This was supposed to be a special event to celebrate a 25th birthday. It was SPECIAL alright...eSPECIALly BAD. The experience was so bad..I'm laughing to myself in bewilderment.   Once everyone was seated we asked for water for the entire table. Things got off to a bad start when it took 15 minutes for the water to even arrive at the table. We we looked around to see why the service was so slow, we noticed that there was only 1 waitress and 1 manager (KIM), to service the entire restaurant. The restaurant was understaffed in the customer service front and the restaurant was only 40% full. I'd say that our 20 person table was 30% of the restaurant and the 10% Caucasians. (I'll get to the Caucasian vs everyone else part later).  What made our party so upset is that:  a) Reservations were made 1 month in advance. So they should be prepared right? WRONG!   They knew 20 people were coming in to their NEW restaurant, so they had more than enough time to be ready. I had specified with Jason (manager) that it was a special event as it was for a 25th birthday celebration and he told me he would be there to make sure it was \"the best''. Well, it was ''the best''....at making us HANGRY. The manager Kim at that time said that one of the staff called in sick. If they call in sick, a simple fix is to get another waitress to come in. They knew that 20 people were coming in. This isn't the first time that they have used that 'excuse' - please refer to Kimmie L's review. I feel the exact same way, and then some. If it has happened before, don't let it happen again. They had more than enough time to prepare. Kim (manager) could have managed the situation better. If she had explained to us that the service would be slower than usual because they were short handed and apologized or even manage the situation before it became a big one, we might have been okay. As a manager, if something isn't going well, communication is key. She failed to acknowledge the slow service when a few members of the party commented that service was extremely slow, and did not apologize for the slow service. Everything was so slow, including the getting the bill. Don't they want $?  b) Food took forever to come,but not if you're Caucasian  It took 90 minutes for all the food to come out. We arrived at the restaurant at 6:30, placed orders at 7 pm and received foot at 8:30 pm.  The restaurant was 40% full at the time. I don't know how long this restaurant will survive if they don't change up their customer service and management. We came to eat, not to be starved.   I agree with Kimmie L's post that \"The owner and the servers really cater to non-Asian customers. My boyfriend and I are Asian and we received not any of the the treatment that other customers had received around us. When others received dishes slowly, they were notified that someone called in sick and they will be served shortly.\"   Although we were seated first and ordered first, we could see KIM (manager) cater to non-Asian customers. As a few non-asian customers came in after us, they received service immediately and received their food before our party even though we had ordered first. They received such quick service that they were able to order, eat and settle the bill before we could even receive our food.  I get that this area has a lot of Non-Asian customers, and maybe Kabuki caters to them, but good service is key to running a restaurant and it was extremely obvious in how they went about things. Since we were waiting for our food, our entire table was able to watch Caucasian tables come and go. 5 tables were served and customers had left before we had received our food. That is not acceptable. Not once were we asked if we were doing okay.   c) The water had some \"white stuff\" in it.  We received water with some \"white stuff\" in it. It was opaque with a sticky gooey consistency. A part of me wants to say it looks like it came from a male sex organ, however it could be really gooey rice or some sort of tissue paper (like when you throw toilet paper into the bowl). Whatever it is...WHY IS IT IN THE WATER?  When we showed the waitress, she said it was the dishwasher. Which didn't make sense because if that 'white stuff' was left from the dishwasher, wouldn't she see it when she poured water into the cup? There was obvious amounts of the mysterious white stuff in the water. Watch out for the fertile waters next time if you go!  We will never come back to Kabuki. Please share this review to save your friends and family. Your time is valuable and precious."}
{"text":"This review is based on lunch experience at Kabuki Sushi Lounge. I rated this based on comparable lunch experience and price point for other Japanese restaurant's lunch offerings.  I like the decor of Kabuki as a lounge. I can imagine myself having a drink and munch on some Japanese tapas dish or sushi?! Oyster specials?! That sure sounded good! And opens late so I can pop by after movie at VIP theater in the same shopping area.  Lunch Chirashi ($16) was so so though. Fish is not the freshest and still ok. Nothing I would rush back or recommend that to my friends as a must try.  +5 star for having bottles from Collective Arts Brewing available and the drink menu is interesting.  Service was attentive.   Not a bad choice for lunch if you are shopping at The Shops at Don Mills."}
{"text":"No complaints about anything at all. Great ambience, very tasty and fresh food, reasonable prices. Good all around"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant since it opened (due to the beautiful photos of their drinks on instagram) but never got a chance to until now.   The overall experience wasn't bad - but for the price point it's not worth it.   I think the overall restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and very modern looking - but due to the emptiness of the restaurant compared to the super busy restaurants surrounding it makes it have a sad, nervous, quiet vibe. The waitress was friendly and very attentive - visiting and checking our table very, very, very often.   The food quality is alright - not the greatest - but the portions are too small to justify the premium price. I would say sushi freshness is slightly better than the Mac sushi stand at Yorkdale Mall and about the same as the Su&Shi Restaurant at Yorkdale Mall.  Now that I've tried this place, I probably never return but go to the other restaurants in the Shops at Don Mills area instead. If you want sushi I would probably go to Joey's instead..."}
{"text":"Lunch menu Chirashi $16.00!  I said to myself, this must be good for that price.  I always order this dish in other high rated restaurants for lunch.  So I know how this should be prepared and presented.    Here's what you will get at Kabuki!  A bowl of sushi rice about 3/4 full of their serving bowl. Then here's the pathetic looking Chirashi where the 5 slices of sashimi is arranged in a pinwheel on top of the rice. One paper thin slice of salmon, one slice of white fish, one shrimp, one surf clam, one slice of fake crab, bunch of ginger, a lot of wasabi as if I have a lot of sashimi to dip into.  Insane!  And you get a bowl of salty miso soup!    Honestly, do you expect me to finish this huge bowl of sushi rice with 5 slices of sashimi???  It's not worth coming here. Save your money.   If there is such a thing as negative star, that's how Kabuki should be rated.  The way sashimi are sliced tells all!  This is not an authentic Japanese food."}
{"text":"Decent Japanese restaurant. Sushi is good here. But not like cheep Chinese owner's all you can eat place. If you feel more to eat but worry about your bill then order the hot pot udong soup. Good for digestion after sushi too."}
{"text":"Entrance:  The entrance is a bit awkward. If there is a lot if people coming and going it could get messy.  Food:  They have a lunch menu as well as the regular menu. I had the agedashe tofu app. It was okay. Hard to really mess up deep fried tofu. It was presented nicely was missing the garlic chips the menu described it as having.  I also got the spicy lady bug roll. Of course i had to get it, sounded tasty and neat. I think the lady bug part was salmon covering the top of the roll with tiny piles of green fish roe. Not very lady bug looking but close. I was a bit concerned about the spicy part, but no worries, they forgot to put the spicy part in. The neat part is, the centre is tempura mini corn. It is a really nice flavour. Hear that other Japanese restaurants, mini corn tempura.... Make it so!  My friend got chicken teriyaki, white meat with brown rice. She practically licked the plate clean so yeah I guess she loved it. You can not tell from the pictures but there is a lot of chunky vegetables under the chicken.  The restaurant was good. I will probably be back. The food was good, the prices a touch highish. They forgot ingredients but the food was tasty. Service was very attentive."}
