{"text":"The food is horrible and the service worse. Not bad people, just not very capable.  Slow and 'Houdini-like'. The food itself is very average.....typically the TK chains have cute girls behind the bar...  This place is all dudes in skirts. Don't waste your money here"}
{"text":"I'm not a big reviewer but, felt the need on this one. My first visit to have wings and a beer. Guinness was delicious and grilled wings with medium sauce were better than expected. All claims on the friendliest staff are false. Barmaid I had was a disappointment. She was impatient, fake, not at all friendly or welcoming. It wasn't like she was busy at 2:00 PM. If you are not a regular, you don't get the time of day. Many other sports bars to choose from with warmer service. Not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"The food is horrible, service still isn't much better (i did give 2 stars instead of 1). I am hoping this place closes so something better might come in. Location is great, such a waste of real estate."}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ bacon burger which wasn't actually bad. Service wasn't very good. Had to ask multiple times for drink refills for our party of 8. Not sure anything ever has been cleaned there. The place was and felt sticky. All beer is served in plastic throw away glasses, utensils were plastic and came plastic sealed with a napkin. Expected a salt and pepper packet to fall out when they were opened. Water was served in styrofoam cups and 2 people had stuff floating in them. I ordered Guinness in a can to be safe.  For a place where I didn't either much other the attractive waitresses, it really didn't even give that much."}
{"text":"Got up and walked out. Sat at table for 10 minutes and was never acknowledged. Poor service never gets you to the point of whether the food is any good. This place seems to be nothing more than a high school redux. I'm going to avoid this place and this franchise from here on out. Do yourself a favor and go to one of the many other good places to eat at CityScape."}
{"text":"I don't expect 5 star food or service from a place like this, but I have gotten better service and food from McDonalds. My visit included slow service from disinterested waitresses, and chewy, tough French fries and an ok burger. This place was awful."}
{"text":"Despite the delicious steak salad, our waitress was a B*$&%. She was extremely short from the beginning, and then tried to charge us for 2 salads when we ordered one. We politely said that we thought there was a mistake, and she just said \"oh.\" snatched the check, and returned it to us without a word."}
{"text":"Awesome place to check out on the strip . Foods really cheap and beyond awesome for the price. I got the Gaelic chicken with mashed potatoes and it was amazing and my son had gotten mac and cheese really good and not like most restaurants just give the kids microwaveable mac and cheese it was made with fresh pasta and cheese hands down the best . Also our server was beyond amazing and attentive very friendly and quick ! So if you want good food and amazing service I would definitely give tilted kilt a try and Ask for Courtney she is amazing ! Will definitely be coming back here again !"}
{"text":"The girls were all sitting at tables talking to their regulars.  Trying to get service was tough.  The food, however, was awesome.  The spinach salad is the best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Went last weekend with a group of 25 to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and watch the Raptors playoffs. I was impressed at the nice venue and attentive servers (Rachel was awesome amongst many!) Good beer selection and loved the \"giant Jenga\" table games and beer pong tournament.  One bad experience of the night was the manager - Fri Apr 24, 8pm to close. The night got a little wild with 25 of us and one server made a mistake with one of our shot orders and brought out an order twice thinking it hadn't been served. The manager was clear that they would enforce their policy of the server herself paying for that order out of pocket ($60). A mistake like that can happen so easily (as the manager told me) and it was very disappointing to see the manager not have the back of the servers who are working hard to make money for the restaurant that employs her. I ended up paying it to ensure the server wouldn't be out $60. After our group spent over $1500 in one sitting I would have hoped the manager would have made sure the business absorbed the expense of that extra order rather than throw her staff under the table."}
{"text":"Great service nice place Dani did a great job helping me pick the right burger for me thanks Dani"}
{"text":"Great food, great girls, great atmosphere. The girls seem to like their jobs and they have fun while working. The Gaelic chicken is the best item on the menu and Ashley is the best bartender."}
{"text":"Was hoping to have fun but overpriced beer and unfriendly bartender ( Brittany). Really 6.75 for a beer. Left after one."}
{"text":"Gastropub?!? Hahaha. The food here is atrocious. Deep fried, frozen, pre packed junk food that tastes like it came from my grade 9 cafeteria. Let's be honest nobody is going here for the food so the next part is really sad. The girls are ugly. They all seem like failed strippers or escorts. These girls aren't hired but 'cast' in an effort to circumvent Canada's human rights code. They must maintain 'measurements' to continue employment (a.k.a. not get fat).  How do i know all this? Well when the entertainment staff (they are not servers btw) are only given 2 table sections they have a lot of time to open up about their problems. What a sad and disappointing addition to my favourite street in the city."}
{"text":"This was the first and last time I will ever go to tilted kilt they have great staff that are jovial this review does not reflect on the servers there food on the other hand have gave us food poisoning"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the fight after a brief trip to see a friend living in the area and the first person I see when I walk in is the beautiful and sweet Monica, she's our favorite.  Only alright place for food. The classic nachos were okay, I wasn't a fan. The service was subpar. We had to wave down our server a couple of times. Girls are too focused on flirting with the men at the bar then actually doing their job.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"You must remember that this pub changed ownership in August so see posts since then to be accurate. When I was there in August it was fantastic! A brand new place!"}
{"text":"Just okay. Fish and chips...fish was a big soggy.  Same as always happens for me: I ordered a beer (Guiness Blonde) from their very limited menu (to what I'm accustomed to at the Flying Saucer in Columbia, SC)...only to find that they were out of it.  Same thing happened in the TK Charlotte with regular Guiness.  Really?!?  Nice, big TVs all over the place, but not a one in sight with the big CBS game-Georgia/Florida. Disappointing. Went back to my hotel room to watch football, instead."}
{"text":"This restaurant leads all restaurants in visible tattoos in the history of restaurants and visible tattoos"}
{"text":"My fave restaurant in Charlotte. Unfortunately our last experience not so good.  We were getting ready for a nice dinner when two woman with three small kids came in all under four.  Wow one was a screamer.  The kind like fingernails to the chalkboard.   Kids that can't behave don't belong in this place.  What happened to parents disciplining their children?  You can't go out for a peaceful dinner anymore!  Waitress first night on job but she was excellent.  Thanks Ashley!"}
{"text":"It's like hooters, kind of.  Or at least I think that's what their going for.    Food - not bad Drinks - standard bar Atmosphere - ok for a sports bar downtown, lots of TVs Service - yeah right.  You'll need to head to the bar at least once if you want to drink anything.  Would I go again?  Yeah, but only if I was meeting someone there and didn't have a chance to persuade them to go elsewhere.  And because it's close to the light rail."}
{"text":"We went here unannounced on a Saturday night with over 35 people. I was concerned that they gave us just one server (Shannon) for our large group, but she NAILED it. The service was phenomenal and the food was great. Our group could not stop talking the next day about this place. For many of us this was our first visit to a Tilted Kilt. I never do online reviews, but these guys impressed me so much, it compelled me to write this. I would recommend them."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Went here with my dad and he ordered a beer that took 15 mins to get to our table. And then our waitress came back with it. And we haven't seen her since. The manager finally came with our nachos for our appetizer and asked if everything was okay and my dad replying with \"fu*k no\", alerted him. He finally took our order and got it out real quick. Manager is a nice dude but needs to get his girls in order. I wouldn't come here if I were you."}
{"text":"We've been here several times. All I can say, is if there is a Sooners game on don't come here.  You will not be happy.  Went with hubby to have a nosh and a beer and we were overwhelmed by the 'group.'  When I said something to the hostess that seated us she said,\" Well it is a sports bar.\"  Granted, but they do have a restaurant to this sports bar which I should be able to sit at and hear my husband speak to me without yelling.  Food is okay, but overpriced for what they give you."}
{"text":"I've seen their ads in the Southwest Air \"Spirit\" magazine.  It looked like a mash-up of Hooters and Brigadoon.    So on our cross-country trip stopover in Pittsburgh, my son and I ended up here after getting the boot from The Rivers Casino (Junior is 18).  I was quite happy with Tilted Kilt.  They had nice 18-ounce glasses of Yuengling that allowed me to assuage my ire of getting tossed out of the casino.  There were TVs everywhere and all the games were airing.  Junior and I started off with Buffalo Wings.  The wings were just as good as Hooters, if not better.  For entrees, I had the Fish and Chips, which was quite good.  Junior liked his Reuben sandwich.  There was a lot of diverse selection in the British/Irish food persuasion.  And then there's the servers.  While Hooter's Girls have to pack all their \"assets\" into a very tight and skanty pair of orange nylon shorts, the Tilted Kilt wenches are in an equally provocative outfit -- short kilts and midriff tartan tops.  But while the majority of Hooters Girls are not particularly friendly, our server was friendly, intelligent, and was a highly competent server.  I like the Tilted Kilt franchise.  I hope we get one in my area. But as soon as I say that, 3 more Subways and 6 more Papa Johns just opened up in Hampton Roads, VA."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be so much better considering it's location. I had visited this chain out of state and had good outcome. My experience here over final 4 weekend was sub standard. We arrived at around 3pm with no one to seat us,so after waiting 5 to ten minutes we sat at the bar. The bartender was a poor attendent serving beer with foam running over dirty glasses. When I asked his supervisor for a glass without lipstick, he replied \"That's not your color? I bet it was a very attractive woman that had this glass before you.\" You would think the place had 50 people at the bar instead of the 7 I counted. Luckily there are other choices in downtown Phoenix. I would be a bad yelper if I did not warn you of the incompetance/douchebagery of this specific establishment."}
{"text":"I came here at about 9:50 pm during the Canada day celebration fireworks.  I was here during a work trip and wanted some food and a beer.  When we arrived, there were many seats open as most people were outside waiting for fireworks.  All I can say is that the owner/manager has given up on this establishment.  It was terrible.  There were only three girls working, and they were clearly frustrated and overwhelmed.  Our waitress took our order for food and two beers and we received the drinks promptly.  At this point we sat and observed.  Aside from some families, there were about 20 \"locals\" that clearly knew the staff.  They were shady, many were drunk and we overheard two of them discussing going to he bathroom stall to use drugs.  We were seated outside and the worst part of this was that these characters were pacing around, clearly high on coke or something and took it upon themselves to come up to us and talk to us about really nothing.  There was also a man who was pacing out behind the hedge and meeting with people routinely making business transactions.  Inside the restaurant, there were locals that were walking into the kitchen.  The staff seemed to have no issues with this.  We never saw our waitress or food again and an hour had passed.  Finally, I asked her to cancel our order and we left.  The fireworks had ended and now the place was busy.  People were not being tended to and service was non-existent.  As a business person, I can say that the owner of this establishment should be ashamed of themselves for how it was run.  Even if the food arrived, I would have been concerned about the quality after witnessing everything else.  If you run a business in a central business district that caters to professionals, you should not allow drug users, drunks, and drug dealers to run free in your establishment.  The Environment was awful.  You should also staff your business with more than three servers during a huge celebration.  That's a no brainer.  Oh and if your staff decided to call in sick YOU should be there getting your fingers dirty making sure things run well."}
{"text":"Tried a lot of the items on the menu because this place is close by to my house. It's an absolute mistake to eat here and the servers are not real servers, they basically just hire anybody skinny enough to fit into their uniform with no experience. They will said rude stuff to you like, \"I can't believe you're not wearing mascara\" and I don't have no lashes or stunning eyes so basically referring to the fact that I'm not wearing not even an ounce of makeup and I'm in public lol. I hope this place burns to the ground for something more unique and fits toronto more accurately."}
{"text":"Clairece (I hope that's how you spell her name) is the best! The food is great & the prices are even better. I got the chicken fried chicken & it was delicious. Will be returning as soon as I come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"It's all right. Typical bar that's not-that-good-but-tries-to-make-up-for-it-with-scantily-clad-women joint. Think Library or Hooters, maybe Heart Attack Grill with the exception of that it's a grill, obviously. Food is mediocre, beer is pretty much the same as you can get in any other bar, so go if you are a lonely guy who likes to look at girls, basically."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, came in on a late flight.  All signage and the web stated that they were open till midnight. We got there at 11:15pm and they were closed. Gave them a second try the next night and sat in the bar section, and when we tried to order the bartender would not serve us! She told us we had 'to have been seated' so they knew we were there!!! In the bar? Didn't even offer to move us to a section with a server. I've never been treated so badly."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We ordered margaritas during the Mayweather fight but they tasted like virgins and the waiter tried to convince us that they were not virgins. Do not order the margaritas they are watered down."}
{"text":"I'm really a fan of the Tilted Kilt.  I like that they are trying to be more than just another franchise sports bar.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating.  Food has been consistently good.  The main draw for me is the beer selection.  The fact they one most arrogant bar in America was a great accomplishment and the party with Stone was great.   I just wish they would put their beer lists on the menu and make sure the waitresses are *somewhat* knowledgeable about the beer selections.  This past weekend I went and the featured Great Lakes Brewery beers were described as \"golden\" and \"dark\".  I ordered the dark expecting the stout that was on the poster when I walked in but it was the amber ale instead.  A simple list of what is available would be great."}
{"text":"We went for an early dinner one evening with two kids. The service was ok, but not great, especially since the place was pretty empty. We were seated in the far back corner and the table was sticky and so was the floor. My daughter ordered orange juice which tasted like it had gone bad. The women's restroom was in bad need of cleaning and one of the toilets was clogged. I have no complaints about our food (we ordered flat bread pizza), but the overall experience left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This restaurant had some of the poorest service I have ever experienced (on a slow night), a relatively small menu that was way overpriced, and OUTRAGEOUSLY priced draft beer. I was shocked when the bill came. A Sierra Nevada on draft was $8!! Unbelievable...  The fries we got were yummy for the most part but the flatbread pizza which was advertised as shareable was tiny, with barely any cheese, no sauce and soggy flatbread. Awful.   There are plenty of other great restaurants in the Phoenix area that are much more worth the value and service than this place."}
{"text":"Horrible service after the electro dash.  Promised a table at 930. We left at 11with no table and the kitchen was closed."}
{"text":"Apparently, this place puts Hooters out of business whenever they erect a Tilted (haha, see what I did there??) next to it.   It's fun, lively, the girls are very pretty and polite, and the drinks are good. We got beers and I ordered a cinnamon toast shot - though I think she liked Mr. Harris, because it was really a double shot.   I'd definitely go here again. Lots of TVs and sports (soccer at the time), and a good mixture of a crowd - which is saying something when you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was awful.  I had heard people talk about the Tilted Kilt as a great place to grab a drink, and a good bite to eat.  Well it was All Star weekend and I suppose I could give them a break.  But...I can't  if you are really busy chain restaurant that just opened you can't have service sooo poor.  We were ignored for awhile, finally a waitress came,  our food took over an hour and when it came it was cold.  I had a bean burrito, it was overly salty, cold,  and even though I was super hungry,  I couldn't bare to eat it.   It came with sweet potato fries that were still frozen in the center.  All of this for like $12.00.... place is kind of a rip-off, and since I am a female,  the girls in short skirts, and big boobs doesn't make up for crap food, and crap service.  The waitresses tried to be nice, but I think someone is training them to be overly annoying,  they sit down at our table to take our order and kept talking to us...  I didn't really understand that....."}
{"text":"Poor service. We've been here for 2 hours and had a change of 3 different waitresses. The first waitress was fine, the second waitress never refilled our drinks or asked if we wanted anything to drink and stood at the bar the whole time gossiping. All they do is congregate around the bar and gossip."}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning looking for somewhere to watch Brazil v. Chile and we were very pleasantly surprised.   Never been to a TK location before so didn't know what to expect but the breakfast was REALLY good, priced well and we had good service.  Will definitely be back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I went here before the Suns game a couple weeks back and sat on the patio. Even though it was a Saturday, the place was fairly empty because we arrived around 3. We ordered pretzels as an appetizer, I had chicken tenders & he had wings. The food was okay. Not bad, but nothing to get excited about. The both of us were also having cocktails (very expensive by the way- $8 for a beer or for a well vodka!) but we were willing to spend the money. The 1 star is in relation to the service. We had service until the food came out. Our server checked on us once while we were eating, but never saw her again after that. We were both ready for another drink, and sat with empty glasses for probably 20 minutes. THIRTY minutes pass by without our server coming by at all, so we finally go up to the host stand, point out our table, & tell them that we've had no service. Apparently that wasn't important to them, because five more minutes pass and still, nothing. We finally go up to the bartender, order a drink from her, & she tracks down our server. She comes back and makes an excuse that she got triple sat inside & asked someone else to check on us - though not a single other employee did despite our annoyed looks. They took 15% off of the bill, but a manager never came over to speak with us. We cashed out & continued drinking at the bar, but only for our lack of time before the game. Ok food, terrible service. Especially for the drink prices."}
{"text":"The food wasnt that great also it took over hour-half  to receive food  and we were the only people eating in the restaurant at the time .We definitely  won't be back"}
{"text":"Will never patronize since they're charging a $20 cover during Super Bowl weekend. Douchey move."}
{"text":"Food was definitely nothing special. The service was definitely pretty disappointing. The hostess was talking on the phone not acknowledging anyone coming into the restaurant, the waitress wasn't rude but sure didn't seem to be happy she was at work. And then they short changed when paying the check."}
{"text":"The nachos did not measure up. However I did send a link from my original review to TiltedKilt.com.   I was very pleased to have them respond personally in a positive way. They said some things were a work in progress and they appreciated my input and would make improvements.   I also mentioned expensive beer and they said as a new place they were in the process of having drink specials and pointed out that the glasses are bigger then most places. The premium beers were reasonably priced.  I have now edited my review because I see they are trying to please and I'm happy try them again.   Stars for the pretty girls alone."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst bars I ever been to. The waitress said they ran out of MODELO AND CORONA. How can a bar in Vegas run out of beer? The food was good but was alittle cold. The reason I decided to stop at this spot was because they had good music and sports on tv. Wish I would of tried something better with a better beer selection."}
{"text":"The food is disgusting. Be ready to find a clean toilet to sit on after you eat here. Don't count on the bathrooms to be clean either. The service is horrible the servers are disrespectful there is no such thing as good service. Ya, sometimes the girls r ok to look at but overall the sacrifice for a fake looking Barbie doll over horrible service is not worth it. I promise if you eat anything here you will get diarrhea. All the food is frozen. Frozen food is disgusting."}
{"text":"Had shots, learned about meditation and the late nite happy hour from a new friend Jean S. Look her up!"}
{"text":"Unlike those in the US, this tilted kilt has a very poor menu. Instead of the usual options, just a printed white sheet with a couple of burgers and appetizers.   Ordered the generic bacon cheeseburger, the bread was stale and the fries were burned black. At least they didn't ruin the coke...  Service was ok, nothing of note. They only had 1 waitress, but the place was deserted, one was enough.   Should have read the reviews before assuming it would be like in the US."}
{"text":"We came in after a Pittsburgh / Dodgers game.  We were seated promptly.  We were not given utensils or napkins.  I had to get them myself. The waitress was non existent. For a 20 min period,  we saw her for 3. Our waitress was Paige. I go to the one in Long Beach CA and do not have this issue.  If I'm ever in the Pittsburgh area again,  I will not bring my business here."}
{"text":"Girls are awesome here.  But can't say the same about the food.   Chicken wings were so so. .  Ceasar salad was. .. let's say I can make better and I can't even fry an egg. .lol The black bean wrap was. .. didn't even bother tasting it. .lol...  Calamari... was disappointed too...   Would I come back. .. only for drinks. .."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game downtown.  The beer selection isn't very complex but it doesn't need to be.  You get exactly what you expect here.  Food is decent and the price is what you'd expect.     Highly recommend this place.  Thanks Cor!"}
{"text":"Ordered to get piña colada, I got the drink and it didn't tasted like piña colada at all, it had too much ice, no cream, no taste of coconut, tasted like a run down lemonade. Me and my other company told our waitress, her name was Kenzie, that the piña colada just didn't tasted like a piña colada at all. She snapped and said \"Uhh.. thats how piña coladas are suppose to taste like..\" she just grabbed our drinks and didn't even apologized for the inconvenience. We were waiting at the table, waiting for her to give us service, she didn't even acknowledge us and talked with the bartender instead. So we just left and never going back again. Horrible service from the waitress. Recommend anyone to hopefully not get Kenzie as their waitress and to just go to another location or any restaurants really around downtown."}
{"text":"My buddy E and I went here to grab a drink and watch the ducks game.  I ended up ordering some chicken dinner with veggies and surprisingly it was really good.  I order a vodka water with 3 limes and they made it perfectly.   The waitress was nice and sweet and patient and dealt with our shenanigans.  The only odd thing was some dude came up to me and rubbed my shoulder for a sec then left in a limo it was creepy lol.  Other than that I would def come back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The girls were beautiful! Seriously. Leah and Rachel were great looking and the best."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I'm giving this place five stars, but it really lives up to all of its promises.   I've been in twice, and both times we were treated great. The first time we went and set at a long bar overlooking three huge-screen TV's. We ordered two of the beer towers and some appetizers. Our waitress was great - there when we needed her, not in our face. We were probably a little loud as well, but that fit right in. Our check wasn't bad either, for three people we spent about $15 each.   Last Friday, I went in for some afternoon bar therapy and to watch the first few UFC fights. The two bartenders, whose names I forget, were spectacular. They had the bar under control, great teamwork. Overall, it was another great experience, exactly what I was looking for.   5/5 for being everything a Sports Bar should be."}
{"text":"Our bartender was rude and impersonal, to start. When my wife ordered a diet coke, you could see her disdain. We saw her once more, when she took our food order, after which she sat in the corner and ate. The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word, and never came back; in fact, I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out. The food was sub par. My wife's Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes, and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side. Also, my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce.   Poor food, awful service, overpriced beer. Visit the Kyrene location or don't go at all."}
{"text":"Nice remodel of an already nice space. This Bonnie Bar is a true Celtic Cantina, hopefully there are no banshees haunting this welcome pub.  This is just what you expect it be- a kitschy, chain-style style restaurant and bar with an Irish/Scottish flair for fun... Are you going to get fantastic food? Incomparable service? Well, no... but in this area in particular that is deluged with national and local corporate cookie cutter establishments, this is a welcome addition, if only because this building is so cool (and okay, they have Kilt Girls)."}
{"text":"The obvious. The girls all look fantastic in their 'uniforms'. You just can't beat the eye candy. The beer selection is great, but I got a lot of stares as I wandered around the bar to check out all the taps, because our waitress had no idea what was on draft. Seriously. Beer menus. Get them. Other than that the service was very good. Prompt and very friendly. Taste-wise the food was quite good. Had a burger and fries, with the Irish nachos to start. My main problem with the place are the high prices, and relatively small portions. I don't know who sets them, but these are downtown Toronto prices. When I'm sitting at 404 and Hwy 7, I'm not too happy to be paying them. All in all a good time. A good place to grab a beer after golf or work. When it's time to eat though, I'll head somewhere more reasonable."}
{"text":"The best tilt a kilt I've been to. Our server was funny, attractive, and did an excellent job.   -grilled chicken sandwich was excellent"}
{"text":"3 stars for the awesome servers and bartenders!! 2 negative stars for the so called manager in his red sweatshirt sitting in the corner drinking with his buddies acting a fool and rudely calling over our server to do stuff for him!! Great management team you have here !!  I will always come here for my great bartenders and servers but get rid of the so called manager being rude to his servers and bussers and bartenders... By the way for time stamp it was Sunday night the 4th of January!!"}
{"text":"Love stopping by this place after a long day at work. Everyone is always friendly and the Bartender  Jameica is always upbeat and happy and makes great drinks. I can show up stressed out and I'm always happy when I leave."}
{"text":"I feel very conflicted in writing this review, but I think it needs to be written. Our party arrived at 4:30pm in order to get a good view of the TVs for Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals.  The good: Food. Everything we ordered came out cooked well and tasted fantastic. The beer cheese? AMAZING. Pulled Pork? Fantastic. After ordering fries from the happy hour menu (more on this later), it took about 20 minutes to get them. Our server gave us a second order at no charge. That's really where the \"good\" ends.  The bad: They didn't have ANY drinks available for happy hour! What kind of bar, new or old, doesn't have drinks available for happy hour?! It's on the menu, but they \"haven't figured out the pricing for it yet.\" So you still pay Strip prices for alcohol. This was a huge disappointment that they hopefully fix very soon.  The UGLY: After being there for a couple hours (3 periods, plus intermissions and OT), someone decided to change the channel in the middle of the OT period. We waited for about 2 minutes before we bailed on our check and ran down the way to Yard House who had the game on. We did come back to pay our check and watch the second OT period, but they had split up our table and didn't put the game back on the TV we had been watching. Our server apologized, but the only comment we received from management was \"you should've stayed. They got the game back on,\" met with a chuckle. As a Kings fan, during the eventual Cup winning game, I felt this was very rude and a little bit disrespectful.  I won't trust Tilted Kilt LV to air any professional sport in its entirety from here out. I understand it could have been a freak incident, but to cause customers and fans to potentially miss the game winning goal and NOT APOLOGIZING is pathetic. They are lucky we were honest people that came back to pay the check. Get your issues hashed out and put booze on the happy hour menu and MAYBE I'll change my star rating. Until then, I won't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The only Tilted Kilt experience I enjoyed. Our server was a sweetheart and wasn't trying too hard to flirt in order to get a good tip. Food was excellent: GET THE PULLED PORK SANDWICH. Nothing amazing enough to get 5-stars, but still a good spot to eat."}
{"text":"Service was bad, sat talking with friends . Nachos cheese wasn't melted . We will not be back . Surprised they stay open ."}
{"text":"MJ and Mark were outstanding in catering to our large group of 17 Navy veterans and friends this past weekend. We were all in town for the Cards vs 49ers from all over the States. The Tilted Kilt was the best place to wrap up a great weekend with the boys. MJ and Mark even provided a TV and HDMI cable so we could show our slides of our past 9 years worth of photos of when the group visited a different NFL city each year. They also provided a second TV for our portable karaoke machine. Tilted Kilt rocks! The food was good and beer was cold! I would be remiss if I didn't give a shout out to o ur lovely server Heather from Alaska.  She was awesome and so nice to take care of our large and crazy group of guys. Highly  recommend requesting Heather when you visit this location."}
{"text":"The big screens for sports are blurry and way to big unless you get the perfect seat to view from.  The food was ok, nothing great.  We had the clams for an app and they were very small and the price was outrageous.  We also had one of there big burgers which we ordered medium rare and was way over done.  Also VERY expensive.  We ordered there shepard's pie which was very tasty and probably the best thing we ordered.  The dinner cost over $50 and was no where near worth the price.  For what we got I would have been happy paying half what we did.  We will not be going back.  Service was very good though."}
{"text":"This \"Irish Pub\" is amazing! The food is above average for bar food. The Girls are not only beautiful and smart and on top of your orders, But they make you feel like you know them! They are always smiling, always beautiful, always upbeat, and make sure that its a good time! The owner Bob is a saint, and the management is pretty awesome too! Irish nacho's and Tilted Guilt \"A warm cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top\" is to die for! You will always feel extremely welcome there! Big step up from hooters, and the girls knock the socks off the girls at other sports bars! I give it 5 stars, And I have NEVER done that for a sports bar!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. We got sat at 7:55pm and did not see a waitress till 8:15. It was not busy at all. We ordered an appetizer and 2 burgers. The appetizer came out with our meal and neither the burgers or the appetizer were prepared as requested. Took 5 minutes just to get a side of tomato and lettuce. There was no apology for messing up our order and then our waitress disappeared when we asked for our waitress she wouldn't even come cash us out she continues to sit with another customer for about 10 minutes and was still there when we left. The food once done correctly was amazing but the customer service was the worst!!!"}
{"text":"Love the mozzarella sticks and the chicken tender wraps, I get it with grilled chicken and Tk sauce, mmmm delicious! Been eating it for years! Love Taylor she's a fire cracker"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very good looking waitress. However I was there last Thursday night they had a male singer there and he was the worst couldn't hole a note in a bucket. Also this is the second time I was there and the service real slow. That's the reason for the two stars I hate bad don't care service"}
{"text":"Great time. Food is tasty, atmosphere is comfortable and girls are beautiful. I highly recommend this place if you are on the north shore."}
{"text":"My buddy Paul and I enjoyed an excellent lunch there one mid week day and had the nicest waitress anyone could ask for. Great food & service!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Great service, actually exceptional service. Very attentive from servers to management. I got one of the burgers very tasty. Great happy deals. Great selection of beer and drinks. I would definitely come back when I'm in town. Go Dodgers. Haha"}
{"text":"Nothing really special here. Less than mediocre service and just about average food. Basically Scottish themed hooters from what I can tell. Except with worse food and less poorly faked compliments in my direction."}
{"text":"Expensive drinks. Expensive food. Food's not good.  But the bartenders and waitresses are hot as hell."}
{"text":"What can I say? I am happy with this place. This was actually my 2nd time there and it didn't disappoint. We sat at the bar during Happy Hour and had a beer. The bartender was great(I love how they all introduce themselves in Phoenix, unlike Chicago)Got a little hungry so we ordered the Calamari that we previously enjoyed and a Pint O' Fries($2 happy hour special) Came out hot and delicious. Love the sauce for the Calamari, its like a Spicy Mayo with chopped green onion! Last time we went there we had Fish and Chips and Calamari. Both were very good last time as well.  Not a place we will frequent much with so many new options in Phoenix, but really love their semi-outdoor bar area! Complete with misters and several TVs."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Tilted Kilt in downtown Phoenix tonight. We had an Amazing Waitress named  Jasmine (the blonde one). She was so attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and we were just impressed. The food was on point and the atmosphere was awesome! I definitely recommend trying this place if you are going Downtown."}
{"text":"The hostess was rude and other staff would not even crack a smile. Although our waitress was nice, the food was ok, it did not meet our expectations. Nothing like what you see on their website. I would not return to this place or recommend it."}
{"text":"Great bar, the food is top notch and the good service is always a key part of the fun in going. I love the setup with its huge, matching, high quality, TVs everywhere. It just looks good and you can always find something you want to watch. Highly recommended dropping by anytime, especially on a night Ben is on the Piano. It's always a good time."}
{"text":"Simpatico pub con cameriere in kilt e top! Simpatico senza essere volgare. Buona scelta birre e mangiare ok."}
{"text":"This restaurant should be closed. I am only giving it one star because I could not post this with zero stars. We stopped here before a concert on Saturday and should have been warned just by the fact that it was the only place that had tables available. We waited at least 10 minutes before the server even acknowledged us. The list of reasons why no one should be served here is long . The beers are served in plastic cups , the utensils are plastic and the queso dip was served in a styrofoam cup. We waited over an 1 1/2 hours and our wings still weren't done. When we asked about them, the manager seemed confused then came out with an order that wasn't ours and said \"your order is not up but you can have this one.\" We refused it and asked for the wings to be taken off of our bill. We were told by the server that we would not be charged for anything. We were very glad to get out of there but stopped in the restrooms before leaving. Another bad choice. The ladies room had a sign on every other stall stall stating that it was out of order and there wasn't any toilet paper. There was only a small stack of paper towels and 1 out of 3 soap dispensers working. My husband was telling a waitress that the men's room didn't have any paper towels either and her response was just that she would tell her manager when she had a chance. The cleanliness of this restaurant makes me wonder how many people got sick from eating there and also relieved that our food never got to our table . Please don't eat or drink here."}
{"text":"Crazy delicious fish tacos.  Crazy pretty waitress Kaitlyn. She treated Erin and I great."}
{"text":"Management is great! Service great too. Name many sports bars feed you good food and brews then make sure you get home safe."}
{"text":"Très ordinaire comme bar. Allo la thématique, aucune serveuses rousse et la musique est du top 40 hitlist !"}
{"text":"The service is good here and nobody cares about the food they just go here to look at the girls lets face it. you can get way better burgers at 5 guys but they don't have pretty girls walking around in kilts."}
{"text":"Fun neat place cute outfits ...good food and fun tshirts to purchase....I like the out door order window also"}
{"text":"Its always freezing cold in there.obviously so the waitresses nips will protude,but its uncomfortablly cold,always,whether its 120 degrees outside or 50.the drinks are expensive and the service sucks because they hire severs based on looks not skill.and the kicker is,most of them aren't even good looking.they're just skinny with fake boobs and bleach blonde hair.there were actually 3 good bartenders there a few months ago.(one of them male)but I've been told they no longer work there.they were the only reason I ever agreed to go there when friends tried to persuade me.the food is actually decent.just regular bar fare,and despite the freezing temp inside,the layout and decor is nice.they have a couple of pool tables too.1 star because the only good bartenders aren't there anymore and everyone else there sucks at serving.and of course having to bring a sweater in the middle of summer ."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a drink with a friend and when the bill came - deep in the conversation and company - I paid it and left. However, as I was leaving I realized that I had paid a $65 bill for two drinks when I glanced my receipt. Bartenders seemed unapologetic about the situation and blamed the machines. I asked for a deduction in my bill and they said no one on site was authorized to make refunds so I had to come another day. Not impressed with service!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, but I believe her name is dinease, she took her time getting drinks, didn't know what size glasses She had for draft, and kept having to walk away when we asked questions and wasn't really sure of anything, we got to ordering our food and she didn't know what was on certain items, and forgot to put in the other half of our meal, nor did we get silver wear and had to walk up to get our own, and having to ask other servers for simple things, I'm also a bartender and a server, it looked a little unprofessional. Granted I know not everything can be remembered, and tables are being taken care of, but most of the time she was just standing by the computer.. I'll still be returning, but I know that certain situations should indeed be talked about to make the job easier for her and keep good reviews for your amazing business.  2 stars for service. 5stars for the food."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 13 guys. We had a lot of fun and the food was good. Nothing super special about the place. We or what we expected from a sports bar with push-up bra wearing scantily clad waitresses."}
{"text":"Been going to this place a long time. Noticed the last few times the service was getting slower. This evening, met up with a couple of friends for a beer and wings to catch up. It was not busy tonight so all should be good. After about 10 minutes without any service, we waved down a cute lady. She said it was not her table and had no idea whose it was and walked away. About 5 minutes goes by and we wave another one down. Same response. After 20 minutes we decide to leave and go next door to Hooters. On the way out, the two young ladies at the front desk who greeted us on the way in say's \"have a good evening\". After explaining what had happened, their respond was \"too bad, guess we may not see you all again\". Went next door to Hooters. Service was great, beer was cold and the food was excellent. GOOD LUCK!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go prior to or after a downtown sports, or other event. Food is good, including some non-traditional sports bar fair. Plenty of beers to choose from, the TVs are well placed, and it's hard to beat the service. Denielle and Megan are especially friendly, and efficient."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times with coworkers at lunch.  When they first opened food was really good, and service was too.  Our last visit I sent back my dish because it tasted odd and the potatoes were raw.  Service wasn't that great, the waitress were all standing at hostess station talking.  Not sure if we'll go back"}
{"text":"I'm here right now. I am having really bad service. Not very crowded... maybe our server need help but we watched our server walk by us 4x and didn't even notice 2 empty beer glasses. Isn't that where you make your money??? We eat at many tilted kilts in many cities.. I have to say this experience wasn't favorable."}
{"text":"What an awful bar. They were out if my first two choices, so I had to settle on the Irish stew. I swear it was just poured out of a can and put in the microwave. The side dish \"garlic bread\" was just two slices of bread that were buttered and put in the toaster and sprinkled with garlic powder. I make a much better Irish stew than that.  P.S. What Scottish/Irish bar doesn't have Guinness?    Tilted Kilt."}
{"text":"service was not bad food could be better wings were over cooked i know its a new need to work out the some minor issues lots of beer to choose from .Hopefully the next time i go back it issues will have been worked out"}
{"text":"Well I liked this place it smokes it's main rival Hooters. The food is much better more  screen TV's and the girls are much better looking. What else can you say."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Everything is brand new and nice! Quick service and delicious food. Our server Erika was very nice. The only thing I didn't like was walking upstairs to use the restroom. Other than that it was a great place!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar at this place and it was just horrible. That's all I the attention i will give this place. Save your self the disappointment."}
{"text":"They have excellent fish and chips ,the same with the  nachos. Also, on the healthier fare...great grilled chicken dish."}
{"text":"Just want to say it was the 'MOST DISGUSTING' food and women's restroom! I would of prefer to use Mr. John portable toilets instead of yours. Our server (blonde with NASTY Nose Piercing) was so rude & so unprofessional, I will never EAT at any of your locations, PERIOD!!   Ps. I never YELP but I had too since it was so disgusting and wrong!!"}
{"text":"I work right across the breeze way from this location at City Scape. I stopped by to have a quick adult beverage before going to an appointment. I enjoyed the view of downtown Phoenix from the bar."}
{"text":"This was my first visit at this location in several years. When I first sat down at the bar I was greeted by a very nice bartender named Malaya. I liked that they had San Tan Devils Ale on tap. Their food was not bad either."}
{"text":"I went in on a Saturday night with a couple of friends. It was busy but not overwhelming. We were greeted and seated right away. Then waited around 10 minutes for the waitress to finally acknowledge us. We ordered pina coladas but what we got was basically ice blended with some colada mix. It tasted like watered down pineapple juice. Around 10 minutes later I had to signal our waitress. She argued and insisted that it was a pina colada. She finally took the drinks back to be remade. 10 minutes or so passed and she had still had no interest in taking our order. Instead she was chatting with the bartender and a group at the bar. We got tired of waiting and decided to leave. We went to Copper Blues instead. The service was poor and frankly so was the waitresses attitude. I will never be coming again."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say. I didn't come here for the food. There's something about the beer that makes this place special.   Typical pub fare, it's decent, but over-priced.  You figure that the team uniform has less material so it costs less to purchase... which should translate into lower operating costs and savings for the consumer! alas, that's not how it works."}
{"text":"The Tilted Kilt is your average sports bar.  Lots of TV's to view. Most are LCD TV's but a couple are projection TV, so the view is big. The bar is located on Warner just west of Kyrene on the north side of the street.  Lot's of beer brands available, both on tap and bottles.  Food is nothing to write home about, what I would call average quality. I'm sure the guys are not there for the quality of the food. I'd guess they are there for the outfits worn by the waitressess, which, by the way, are quite applealing. My buddies and I golf a lot in the east valley, so it's a good place to get a bite to eat after playing 18 holes."}
{"text":"IF THE OWNERS ARE READING THIS, PLEASE FIND A NEW BARTENDER, YOURS IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN.  EVER.   Last Friday (Jul 16th)  me and my girl friends went to this place. It had been around for a while, so I figured I'd give it a go--what a bad mistake.   First of all, I don't care what anyone says. I don't care if it's a bar. Hooters has more class in dress. One of the girls (waitress) was NOT WEARING UNDERWEAR AT WORK. And that is DISGUSTING. Pretty sure that's a health code violation as well.   Some of their girls just don't need to be wearing the all bare midriff shirts. I'm not going to judge anyone, as I myself have been much heavier in the past. But they should at least give them an OPTION of something other than overly slutty catholic school girl whore. One waitress was wearing heels and poor girl looked like she was about to cry.   Anyway.   When we got there I had a guiness. From a waitress who was good at her job. Then I ordered a Celtic...crush, I think? It was okay...the waitress was very good at her job. Me and my friends talked a while, and some time passed. Then the waitress told us the room was closing and that we could stay, we just had to move to the bar.   Okay, whatever.   Here's what pissed me off the most: the bartender. Some stupid -use your imagination- who thought the world needed to give her 5 dollar tips because she could pour alcohol into a glass, and not even correctly. My friend ordered me something that tasted like a Sex on the Beach with rum. I don't remember the name. The bartender gave us our drinks. When I asked her to tin my drink because I didn't want to sit there stirring it for a half an hour, she stared at me like I was dumb. Uh, hello? If you don't know what tinning a drink is, you probably shouldn't be behind a bar.  If she was staring at me because I asked her to tin a tall drink, she should work on her customer service skills. I am the customer, I asked her to take about 10 seconds of her time to roll a drink for me. I didn't ask her to give me her freaking liver.   After she told me she didn't know what tinning was, she said that she had to help another customer but would be more than happy to come back and have me explain it to her. Sounds good. At this point there were three guys at the end of the bar, me and my friends, two other guys at the other end of the bar, and then two guys in what I will assume was a pool room. The place was a graveyard.   She did not appear in front of us for 40 minutes.   My friend Jes basically had to grab this girl by the arm and tell her that we wanted to leave because we hadn't been serviced in more than half an hour when there weren't more than 10 people in the bar. The bar tender looked incredulous, like it had been the busiest day in her life. When our tab came in, we did not leave a tip because her service was that bad. She had the nerve to ask us WHY she didn't receive a tip after we had to almost physically touch her to get her to notice us.  And more than a half hour of EMPTY DRINKS sitting on her bar.   I don't know where they found this \"bartender\" or if this girl has ever even seen alcohol before, but needless to say I won't be returning until  I hear that they stop putting unprofessional women in their establishment. That includes no-panties woman."}
{"text":"Good wings but service is horrible. First time and last time here. Waited forever for a drink that never came."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE Our server Kareena was great but the manager made me never want to visit ever again.  A friend called to ask about places to park and the hostess suggested we park in the garage above the building since parking is validated. When leaving the restaurant the parking attendant tried to charge us even though we had validated tickets. After calling and speaking to the manager, Dan, he came out to the parking garage and proceeded to argue with us aggressively and accuse us of trying to skip out on our tab and not pay for drinks even though I tried to show him our receipt. He confused us with another group of African American patrons that were at the restaurant. He kept saying to my friend, \"You and your boyfriend were...\" but there were only two of us and we're both women. After trying to get further clarification and explaining the situation to Dan, no resolution was made and he stormed off, told the parking attendant to revoke our validation (after the attendant told us it would be $8) and made us pay full price. Never again will I visit or suggest it to anyone else and I work a block away from the restaurant. Don't waste your money, spend it where you'll be respected as a customer."}
{"text":"This place was nothing but a huge disappointment, first of it took 45 minutes to get our drinks, the food came 20 minutes before the water. After 1 hour the sever informed us that the bar was out of ice! 11:00 pm on Friday with 4 tables in the place and they were out off ice. The manger was just chilling at the bar and when I took our 45 minute Margarita to the bar because it tasted like sugar with a hint of ice the bartender decided the best solution was to pour in orange juice.  Seriously WTF we are from out of town and we wasted 3 hours of our vacation on this bum stop. Please save your money and keep going"}
{"text":"It's weird that they would not serve my girl friend and I after the Dbacks game at the bar. My friend who I was with is 6'1 and I'm 5'0 and I had to jump over the bar stool to get into my seat because of the crowded bar, and 5 minutes later the manager said they could not serve us because \"we were falling over the chairs\" clearly we were not. There was no slurring of words nothing, they didn't even start a conversation with us to see how our speech was. But obviously the management haven't taken their liquor cert. title 4 to look for things in an \"intoxicated person\" thank god we didn't spend our money on this establishment."}
{"text":"We had great service but from other reviews that must vary. It was still only their second weekend open but she gave as much detail as she could.   The food was decent. We split the Irish nachos, which were just ok. I had fish and chips which were nothing special but good. My my fiancée had the buffalo chicken flatbread, which was great.   Beer selection leaves a lot to be desired for a pub. I had a hard time picking because nothing great. The shakers were really good.   Overall we had a good time. I think my fiancée enjoyed it more then I did. We'll probably try it again at some point."}
{"text":"I watched the UFC card here and the service was out of this world. The girls were friendly and gorgeous, and the bouncer was the coolest ever. I love it and I never wanna leave"}
{"text":"First time for me at a Tilted Kilt.  Service, food and scenery were all pretty mediocre which was fine, I didn't go in with high expectations.  Would've left feeling it was an ok experience but on our bill, since my wife and I wanted ranch for our fries and an side of bbq sauce for the bbq burger, they charged $1 each small cup.  Yep, $3 in sauce.  I realize it actually costs the establishment money so ok charge me, but $1 each?  The least you could've done is warn me you were going to gouge me."}
{"text":"5 of us stopped here for Happy Hour and food. It was not crowded but we did finally get served once but were unable to get served a second time. We finally ordered a second time but never saw it. When we got our check the waitress said she would not charge us for the drinks we did not get, Gee thanks. No reason to ever go back there."}
{"text":"No part of this experience was satisfying. Waitress gave slow poor service and there were very few customers in the restaurant. Bartenders would not make the drinks. We asked four times and never got them. Food was just ok besides the fact we found hair in the steak sandwich. Having no AC on a 92 degree day didn't help either. Never got the drinks. Would not recommend during the day. Seems more of a night spot. Somebody could give it a chance then."}
{"text":"Food Poisoning...   I have come to this location a few times. The first two times were good, the food was alright and nothing special.   However, the last time I went, about 3 months ago, I got serious food poisoning from the Pastrami Sandwich. It was around 9pm when we showed up and there wasn't too many people there. The service was good but the food was terrible as I spent the next week with a knot in my stomach not being able to eat much at all. The same night I threw up multiple times and other things I won't mention...   I would avoid this place and go to a different restaurant. I won't be eating here ever again in fear of going through the worst bout of food poisoning I've ever had."}
{"text":"We went to the Tilted Kilt for dinner after the D'Backs game yesterday (Sunday) April 27, 2015. It was myself, my son and his friend. The place was really crowded and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table. When we were seated, it took a while for a waitress to come over to us. When she did, she was pleasant and polite. We ordered drinks. They came pretty quickly. We ordered our dinner then and it took a really long time for the dinner to be served. Our drinks were already gone. We wanted to order a second round, but no one was to be found. The dinner finally arrived, but we had no utensils or napkins. We asked the girl that brought the food to us and she said she would find our server. Would it be so difficult to just bring utensils? don't you think it would take less time bringing the utensils and napkins than go looking for our waitress and then have her go find the napkins and utensils?  I ordered the Tilted Club. The bacon was limp and undercooked. No one likes limp bacon. There was also no pickle. We have eaten here many, many times and I like the Tilted Club. It always comes with a pickle. Not today. Well, halfway into our meal, I spilled my drink all over. I used my napkin and my sons friends napkin to clean it up. I went to the front desk to find someone (anyone) to report this to. The hostess said she would find our server. How come no one can find our server??  Well, they found her. She came over and left to get some one else that could us with the spilled drink all over the floor. Some guys came over with a wash cloth to wipe down the table. A wash cloth?? He then used the same washcloth to wipe the floor. Really?? No towels or paper towels to dry the wetness?? There was still ice on the floor and the floor was still wet. Any one walking by could have slipped and fallen and gotten hurt.   I was hoping the server would have re-filled my drink, but her inattententiveness did not a  permit her to do so. I also had no napkin for the remainder of the time we were there.   To top this off, I went to use the restroom and it smelled like a sewer. The toilet was clogged and the content from the bowl had spilled onto the floor. What a mess!  Needless to say, we will NEVER frequent the Tilted Kilt downtown again. I would urge everyone to stay away until they clean up their act."}
{"text":"Great experience at this location, good food and great service. Had the traditional TK wings and Irish Nachos, everything was great along with the drinks."}
{"text":"So....shall we start off with some positives?  Ok. The beer selection here is good and the happy hour drink specials are not bad. AND there is a plethera of flat screen TVs that surround you. It's definitely hard to decide whether to stare at the TV or the big tata's attached to the servers. I managed to find a happy medium.  The menu is has great variety, but the food itself was only ok. I ordered the Sloppy Jane, the other half ordered a Salad. The sandwich was huge and messy, just how I like it. The first three bites were devine, and then it started tasting soggier and soggier. The salad was bleh.  As to be expected, the place is definitely a sausage fest...BUT a good place to go to, to catch a game or have a quick drink. I don't think I would linger long enough to watch the masses get wasted though..."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Service is terrible. If you want anything other than to look at a bunch of cleavage, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Horrible food and service.  It took over 15 minutes for our server to approach our table and then it took her about 20 more minutes to get us waters.  Against our better judgment, we ordered anyway hoping that the food was better than the service, nope.  We ordered chips and salsa, a burger and a tilted kilt club.  After about 15 minutes a server came up to tell us that the \"kitchen was backed up\" so it would be awhile.  There was only about 5 other tables.  I then asked if we could at least get the chips and salsa, she brought them out about 15 minutes or so later.  When the food finally came, everything was overly salty, the chips, fries and even the club sandwich, which was supposed to be a CLUB sandwich with lettuce and tomato, but only had turkey, cheese and bacon.  The food was horrible, I didnt even eat half of my food.  It took so long for our food to get there as soon as it came out we asked for our check.  20 minutes later we still didnt have our check so we had to ask again.  Such a waste of money and time.  You couldnt pay me to ever go back to a tilted kilt for any reason."}
{"text":"This is not a good place to eat. They didn't have the food we wanted in stock. Waitress messed up our entire order. Gave the person who ordered beer water and the person who order water beer. No sauce on the burgers, waitress saw us once after she took our order. Food took forever to come out and we were one of the few people in there."}
{"text":"Good food and beers. Fish and chips are great! They have plenty of seating for a large group. It's only 4 stars because the Men's RR was in bad shape. Friendly bar staff and good location. Get a cold beer and burger here!"}
{"text":"Where's the scenery?  I thought this place was known for it's visually pleasing wait staff.  Very disappointed.  Drinks were expensive and service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Why do I come back to this place? Guess eye candy. Food has always been marginal at best and service poor. Today 40 minute wait on a salad. Yes a salad."}
{"text":"Food is OK. Chicken wings are not worth the price.  Bartenders need to be bit more friendly.  They should take notes from Twin Peaks."}
{"text":"Myself and a few buddies had the opportunity to stop in here this past weekend (6/15) and we didn't leave disappointed. If you like watching sports of any kind (Including the UFC events) this is your place. I don't believe there's a TV smaller than a 55\" and there's a monster-sized projection screen, as well. The bartenders took care of us without a hitch and the 'shakers' are not to be missed (TK Exclusive beverage).   Give it a shot ... Good times with good people."}
{"text":"We Got A Piper Down! By The Rue  For lunch today was the Tilted Kilt, I arrived in a car and not on stilts, This is not The House That Peter Built, When I play pinball I never tilt!   My opinion it's a two star \"pub\", A lot of T.V.'s and mediocre grub, Take a shower or get in the tub, Maybe the girls will give you a chub.  Went with the blackened chicken flatbread, Lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle spread, Right after I ordered I thought in my head, I should have went with cheesesteak instead.  It looked good right when it came out,  After the first bite I wanted to shout,  \"Where is the chicken\" I should have spout, But I sucked it up anyway, and I hate No Doubt.   It's funny to see all the negative reviews,  From all the guys who don't have a clue, Don't get mad when the chicks aren't into you, Go home and pout when you finish your brew.  The ice tea was rich and strong how I like, Snoop Dogg called E-Z-E's mom a Frisco Dyke, If you're a stickler for food then you might dislike, The choices here but no reason to strike.   It's a much better place to watch the game, Don't even bother asking your waitress her name, They get it all day long you're just the same, Another tool in a used BMW, what a shame.   Courtney our waitress was right in stride, Efficient and cute and certainly not wide,  To the girl with the huge tattoos down your side, I would marry you tomorrow and make you my bride!!  HAGGIS!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during a convention in Phoenix.  The girls are good looking and the service was okay.  The salad I ordered had pieces which were black, and appeared just plain rotten.  My boneless wings were perfect.  About the best I have ever had.  the price was about 15 bucks with a drink and my salad upgrade.  I will go back but will pay more attention to what the food looks like.  I highly doubt the cook and the server missed the rotten lettuce on the plate.  Three stars for lack if attention and spoiled salad.  The wings and nice boobies saved this place from a 1 or 2 stat rating."}
{"text":"I love downtown and have frequented this spot many times.  Monday, Feb 2 we arrived and the place was busy but we were seated right away.  Our server seemed distracted and rushed.  It was going to get worse.  The Bud Light arrived.  In plastic cups.  Really?  Well I guess what can you expect for only $7?  Yes, seven dollars for Bud Light in a plastic cup. Service continued to be slow, but the calamari finally arrived.  Pretty average stuff, but acceptable.  Unfortunately no napkins. We finally tracked down our server and begged some napkins. No silverware though. The rest of our meal arrived.  Food was okay.  All in all we spent $50 for two beers and two entrees (our companions had the calamari). But we did get the nice Plastic cups and I suppose we could have taken them home as souvenirs. Perhaps the restaurant didn't realize the super bowl was over and it was time to quit gouging the patrons, but if you are gonna charge $7 for a bud light at least put it in a proper glass and have decent service. We felt like we were taken advantage of and taken for granted. For now this place is off the list and we will be heading for that other nearby local Irish spot.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"After a long day at the office, I met a couple co workers and clients after the office to grab some food and drinks. I frequently go to the Tilted Kilt in Scottsdale near my house and I would have to say that this was a way better experience than the one I usually go to. The server was attentive to our table and made multiple trips for us to make sure we always had our glasses filled up. The food was exceptional, cooked perfectly the way a burger should be, lol. The girls here really make an attempt to make the brand what it should be. They always were there joking with us and made my guests feel at ease. Thanks Girls!!!!  We will definitely be back to this location when on that side of the valley. Thank you Danille and the rest of the staff for making such a great experience for me and my guests."}
{"text":"So, I'm in Surprise, AZ on my way to raise some trouble in NY, when my buddy PRS brings me here, the Scottish Hooters.  Brilliant place, I like the atmosphere and two guys across the way were kind enough to help us out more than the waitress or waiter I watched walk by. They were understaffed, it appeared, and it looks like better times need to be ahead for this little area, so I'm gonna cut them some slack on that one.  Anyway, the bartendress Jazmine (sp?) is not only going to many some guy or girl the happiest person on earth, but she saved the day. Her beauty and charm sent good vibes to me and my buddy, along with four pints of Guinness, some fish & chips and calamari.  I agree with Daren C.'s review. The food is just ok, but I did eat it happily with some malt vinegar that another waiter was kind enough to bring. The Guinness was very well poured and thoroughly enjoyed both of my pints.  I wish you all the best and will definitely stop in if my travels have me come by this way again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing if you want to be ignored and wait an hour for your food! They must have caught the chickens themselves and handmade the tortilla chips for our nachos that took nearly an hour to come out. My advice, get drunk first so that you lose track of how long your food takes and how horrible the service is."}
{"text":"Skip this bar.  Regardless of your opinion on places like Hooters or Tilted Kilt, this place is really not worth your time or money. The food was terrible and greasy, the service was ridiculously slow and moody, and the tables are absolutely tiny. The whole night I constantly felt like I was in someone's way, even sitting at my table. And unisex bathrooms? Really?  I've been to a few Tilted Kilt locations through the US and been perfectly satisfied, but this one is a poor imitation. If you've been to one of those, do not expect the same experience. It's just not.  Toronto has a ton of good pubs and bars. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"Tilted Kilt uses push up bras on extremely skinny women to look like it's at all interesting. Too bad it fails at that. I'd rather have fully clothed waitresses who are quick with orders and attentive to their tables. Although I'm sure that the women are supposed to be 'extra friendly' to the male patrons there to watch sports on the abundance of tv's. \"Oh wow, this young, thin waitress wearing almost nothing is talking to me! What an experience!\"   The place loses points for; having terrible staff ( not rude, just incompetent), our shots tasted watered down, having 15 different kinds of lagers on tap, and the food was bland. In fact the food was so bad that I found myself fighting the urge to vomit in the middle of the night. I get the whole sexy outfit thing, but this isn't within the realm of reasonable. One of my fellow patrons mentioned that you would almost have to shut something off in your soul to face this kind of work. I fought the urge to ask our waitress what her life goals are.   So that's that, I wouldn't recommend it for getting shit-faced because the service stinks and it's not very good for grabbing a bite before heading out. And as a pub I gotta ask, what are you good for?"}
{"text":"Well all I can say is the beer is cold and the girls are pretty. The rest was something to forget. The menus were dirty and should have been thrown out. The cutlery not clean. The food disgusting. The owners and managers have given up. Its time to fix it or close it. We wont be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of pub food and haven't really eaten here a bunch and the food I ordered was just ok. The last time I went though, I was pleasantly surprised with the chicken wings! They were a bit on the spicy side for \"medium\" but it really enjoyed the taste and the sneaky spice that would get ya after you finished one... Sneaky spice... Hmm... If I were in a boy band from England I think that would be my name... Ok that was not funny at all!!! :)   This is a good place to meet up for a drink and hang on the patio for a while to watch a game or catch up with a friend. The TV's are OK to watch a game but not great as they have some older ones, some with HD and some without. The atmosphere is good but really hit or miss as far as the scenery. It seems that the wait staff has an A team and a B team and only during Friday happy hour or Sat. night have I seen the A team. All of them friendly and have no problems with the service."}
{"text":"Great place. Decided to catch the game here and was pleasantly surprised with the drinks, food, and service. My waitress (don't know her name but very attractive thin African-American young woman) poured a perfect black & tan and could not have been more friendly and accommodating. Good fish tacos. Busy but not crazy. Will come here again if I'm ever back in town. :)"}
{"text":"Went last night before the D-Backs game. It was packed but very well staffed. By looking at some of the older reviews, I think the place likely got the hint that they need to better staff themselves. Love the Pear Cider beer. Got the Irish Nachos...they were pretty good. Atmosphere is defiantly similar to a Hooter's."}
{"text":"Tilted kilt is much more than just a bar! The food is great and the servers are greater! It's a real fun experience :)"}
{"text":"Best friend and I had the best waitress ever BIANCA! Thank you for the super great with a non fake smile service! Best ever! Thank you thank you!!! Felt very welcomed here! Usually we get eye rolls from our waitresses! Best service ever!"}
{"text":"Good fish and chips. Down here  on vacation from Canada Originally from England fish and chips were good. Missed out on checking in for free appetizer but will know next time. Great staff and good service."}
{"text":"Very lousy service. I could have my empty drink on the edge of the table for 30+ minutes before I'd have to wave down a bartender to replace it."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery meal from Tilted Kilt. It took an hour for the delivery and my burger and meal was cold after it was finally delivered to my hotel   Don't bother ordering from this place as they are poorly organized."}
{"text":"First time here and have to say wings are fantastic . Also tried steak salad with cayenne ranch also super . Will strongly recommend   Server Salyna was awesome so friendly even spend time to sit down and talk with me for a while  . That's customer care friends .   Will be back every time I'm back on Matthew nc     Johan"}
{"text":"My family has enjoyed the Tilted Kilt a few times since they have been open at the Cleveland location. We have had a couple of the servers more than once and they always remember us! That, in itself, impresses me! The food that we have had has been quite good. The burgers are huge, seem to be hand-formed, and have always been cooked medium to perfection. Fries are yummy, although I usually get the side salad instead. The blackened chicken fettuccini, gaelic chicken, flatbread pizzas have all been really good!   Say what you want about the outfits, but the girls have all been really nice, down to earth, and working  hard. They work hard for their money and have to put up with creeps sometimes. We have had much better service here than at any of the traditional chains (ie Applebees, Fridays, etc) It's good to see the Tilted Kilt in Cleveland and I hope it is around a long time."}
{"text":"$5.75 yuengling draught. Boobs I can't touch aren't worth that much to me. Only the aesthetics bumped this place to two stars."}
{"text":"Great no service Awful service Server is talking with only special customer"}
{"text":"I went to Tilted Kilt last night with a group of friends and it was not the experience I was hoping to get. The food was ok, a bunch of us had steak and we all agreed that for the price we were paying it was good. Our waitress in the other hand was just awful. I am a customer service representative  and I cannot emphasize how much it matters to me to have a good experience when someone is trying to sell me something. Dont get me wrong, I do feel bad for them because I think the uniform they have to have is ridiculous and they must get all sort of annoying drunk men hitting on them BUT it comes with that job... Ever since she got to our table I could see she couldn't care less to try to be nice, at one point she even made a very annoyed face when my friend was leaving and kind of got in front of her while she placed a beer in our table. Not very often she would come to our table and ask 'Are you guys good? Ok'. This was all she really ever said to us, we could all see she just hates her job and I got the impression that because she's wearing that uniform she thinks theres no need to be nice to people and serve them right. Well, she's wrong... Im sure there are waitresses there that are way, way better than her and my review was only bad because of the service given to me and friends, but I don't think I will be going back to Tilted Kilt anytime soon."}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience ever.   Bad service from the get go. Walked up to the front and 3 hosts standing there. No smiles or even a greeting. We were the first to speak and we said \"for 2\". Because they just stared at us. Pretty rude. The blonde girl walked us to the table, silent and seemed as she could care less. Then our server was alright until we were finished with our food and drinks and didn't receive our check until 30 min after we were finished. It was also the Tuesday block party so there are specials at all the restaurants and shops and for tilted kilt it's 20% entire check. We received our check and of course there is no discount on there. So when the server came by to pick up the check we asked where is the 20% off discount and she replied in shock, \"ooh yeah I can do that for you.\" So I suggest if you are coming in for their specials for the Tuesday block party you ask!! I'm sure she was hoping we didn't know about the 20% off.   We ordered off the hoppy hour menu. The prices are good. Range from $2-$4 appetizers. Food was decent.   Holy hell the beer is damn expensive. They have better deals at other bars at the linq. 32 for 3 beers and 2 were summer shandy?! The beer was more expensive than our food. You would think happy hour being the beer as well. Better off going to yard house. Better prices and better service!"}
{"text":"Nice location, right across from Stage AE, but the gentlemen at the Bar while they were busy... I don't know how to put it lightly, didn't refill my beer or ask me if I wanted a menu, didn't provide any napkins.  There were waitresses all around, just none at the bar.  I recommend a table."}
{"text":"I've wanted to check out The Tilted Kilt after the chain was featured on an episode of 'Undercover Boss', but had to wait until my most recent trip to Toronto as there aren't any locations closer to where I live.  Just before I headed back home on the night of May 26, 2014, I parked a street away from The Esplande and walked to the location, which, contrary to Yelp's listing, is at 42 The Esplande, not 38. I walked in and was promptly greeted, and after being led a short way was allowed to choose my own table, as most of the crowd that night was out on the patio. I picked one near the back.  To get down to the rest of my experience, the shepard's pie that I ordered was pretty tasty, but I have no basis for comparison as I'd never had one until then. Service took a little longer than it should have all-around except for my first Diet Coke, especially while waiting to request my bill and to pay it, but I fault the servers less than I fault management for having just two servers on duty at a time when they should have had three.  As for the decor, it wasn't exactly special but it did add a nice touch. Also, the tvs were easily viewable from my vantage point, and the ones that I was watching were showing baseball and hockey. The bathroom setup caught me by surprise, as I've never seen a unisex sink/separate stall arrangement, though it works well.  While I wasn't entirely enthused by my experience this time, I'll give this location another chance at some point because neither the food nor the service was bad."}
{"text":"I don't often review, and let me preface this review by saying that the Tilted Kilt is not something I would review. With that being said... stop into the Warner location only if Felipe is bartending. I've bartended for about 10 years and seldom do I run into a true professional. He's a great asset to the company, an upbeat and genuine person, and even has a passion for magic. Not kidding... homeboy just showed me some David Blaine card tricks. I will come back every time I 'm in town."}
{"text":"Ok if you are coming here for the food you will be disappointed.  I had the quesadilla and it was tough and tasteless.  Now the bartender did help my lunch experience my showing off her big rack. But her service skills did lack.  Hooters knock off, kinda but if you want to have nice looking \"girls\" serve you it's all good. But have no expectations of actually having a good meal."}
{"text":"This is the first time my wife and I have ever had to drink Stella beer from chipped glasses.  Is this from bad management at the Tilted Kitchen on The Esplanade or just poor disregard to customer safety and quality of service?   Round two , I should of asked for non-chipped glasses!"}
{"text":"The food is OK but it's a bit expensive for what you get.  The service is really hit and miss.  I've been a number of times with co-workers who enjoyed going for the 'scenery'.  I don't go unless I am with others who want to because the 'scenery' is not a big draw for me.  There are better overall sports bars close by (cleavage and legs aside).  That said, the 'scenery' in this place can really be hit and miss as well as the service.  They do have some attractive wait staff who make the most of their uniform.  They have others who are a bit on the \"rough\" looking side.  So if you're going for the 'scenery' understand that you might get a 9 or you might get a 4.    Service is likewise unpredictable.  Clearly some girls are there simply hoping for big tips and doing the minimal in terms of actual work.  I guess they think that wearing a push-up bra and low cut top along with a tiny skirt deserves a big tip.  I tend to prefer wait staff that take food orders, bring drinks, food orders, refills, etc. in a timely manner and do it with at lease some attempt at being polite and friendly.  Some there do, but it seems more common to get a waitress that's unhappy.    Food is generally pretty good.  It's a bit on the pricey side for the portions but if you're not a big eater, you'll probably be satisfied with portions.  Most of their bar foods are very good.  Even some of their \"heartier\" dishes (meatloaf) are pretty solid offerings.  For folks looking for lighter fare, they do have some good wraps.  There's a little bit of everything and I think most people could find SOMETHING to eat.    Overall, I'd go back with friends that wanted to go there.  But I would recommend Hickory Tavern, Bailey's etc. over this unless you simply must have the 'scenery'."}
{"text":"Service was crap and the food was really salty but the atmosphere was good. Maybe a good place to get a beer or a cocktail and bar food but NOT a real promising \"sit down\" restaurant. **BONUS SUPER SKINNY CHICKS IN KILTS AND A 1/4 OF A SHIRT"}
{"text":"The inly reason I gave even 1 star is because my son enjoyed his chicken tenders.  We came on a busy night before a Pirates game.  We had the worst service I think I have ever experienced in a restaurant EVER!  First the hostess sat us at a dirty table in the bar area with a promise that someone would come clean the table and bring 2 more chairs.  Never happened.  We had to get a rag from the bartender and clean it ourselves and hunt down extra chairs.  Then it took 30 minutes to get our drinks and they brought out the wrong ones.  10 minutes later we at least had our drinks.  Never got the app that we ordered and had to hunt down our \"waitress\" to order our food.  Once our good was finally delivered my husbands dinner was ice cold!  Meanwhile we never did receive the additional drinks we had to hunt town said waitress for.  Long story short manager was brought in and the first words out of his mouth were, \" I don 't have a lot of time to talk to you\".  Absolutely unbelievable.  Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"Was here a while ago and I am not sure what happened to the quality of food since my last visit. I ordered the blackand blue burger with garlic parm fries. The burger was overcooked, with mushy, hot lettuce on top. The fries were cold, soggy and not worthy of being considered a \"premium\" side. Not worth the 18 dollars I paid for it.   You would think given the location they would have a better craft beer selection as well. Very generic."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it a ZERO.  When you tell the server you do not like cloves or beer that smells/tastes of cloves and yet she brings a clove beer to you anyhow, I give her a ZERO.  That was just the beginning.  The server had a bad attitude from the beginning to the end.  You are in a service business!!!!  Things went downhill from there.  We had our one beer and wanted to leave but it took another 15 minutes, with empty glasses on the table, to get out ticket.  Never going back."}
{"text":"So so. Good for a drink or two but the food quality is less than average. Not a place I would recommend unless it's a last resort or convenient.   Try your luck see here you might thank me."}
{"text":"I went to dinner with my boyfriend here last night, it was a Friday. They had live music but it was entirely too loud; I felt like I was screaming jt have to speak with him. Also, our server looked us in the eyes maybe once. It took her almost 10mins to bring us the beers we ordered. I would have accepted this if the place was packed, but the place was not even have full.  Not planning on going back"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times and it is getting worse each time. The staff is good but the food is not. The lettuce looked dead and slimy on my wrap and their was a bug in my drink. I prefer twin peaks over Tilted Kilt now"}
{"text":"Good fish and chips.  Ashley is awesome! Very friendly staff and the service was good."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the service was bad.  We had to wait for a hostess to show up, were served warm beer, had to wait a long time to get a cold one.  After we got our food, even after asking for silverware we had to go get silverware/napkins and ketchup from another table.  I get it's a T & A place, but it has to have good service too."}
{"text":"Pretty standard TK.  I've been to them in the San Diego area.  Beer selection on draft was actually pretty poor.  Or at least the menu was.  Copper blues next door had a better mohito and better draft beer selection.  Walked by it the next day and it was shut down for a murder between the staff.  Pretty odd."}
{"text":"Very clean from what I could she. Staff was very friendly and help for many tvs which was nice although boyfriend was disappointed no hockey on but he didn't ask to have a channel change. We both had the beef stew , my boyfriend loved it I thought it was ok a little too sweet and watery. I like a thinker gravy to my stew. So I wouldn't order it again. Had the garlic fries too but to greasy and half of then didn't have garlic.  I can say I enjoyed the place but I wouldn't go outta my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"My coworker recommended this spot after we had a half work day on Saturday.  I figured, \"hell, beer and chicks in skirts..deal\"  I guess I shouldn't really take away stars from them because I wasn't that impressed with the talent this place had walking around, but I suppose I did.  The service is mediocre. I get the feeling that the girls there feel that since everyone is gawking at them, that they don't need to try any harder. After all, breast size dictates tip size, correct?  It's a bar, with a bunch of regulars,who hoot and holler when their fave skirt punches in for work.  If you're offended by women being treated as skirt-clad sex objects, don't come. But if you want a cold pint and some visual stimulation, stop on in."}
{"text":"Food was decent, staff was friendly when they paid attention to you, I was there kind of late and on a random night of the week and the staff seemed more concerned with their gossip and chit chat than taking care of customers... Kind of disappointed, they were dead and no one came by to check back in.  I'm only in town for business but if I lived here I would try somewhere else"}
{"text":"We were really hungry and Outback and Texas steakhouse (we were in the mood for steak if you can't guess) were big long waits. Tilted Kilt looked empty, so we decided to just give it the good ole Irish try and walk in. While I can't say anyone was blatantly rude or neglectful, like in other reviews, I definitely won't ever be back. The food took a really, really, really, seven or eight more reallys long time. We looked at each other in stupidity, because if we would have just waited at one of the other places we really wanted to go, we would have been eating by now. I had the fish and chips, and it was mediocre and really greasy.   There was a waitress behind us the whole time sitting and talking to an 80 year old man about all his houses and cars and the trips he could take her on, so there was that as well.   It looked like there were maybe four other people there besides us, so maybe Tilted Kilt should just stay in their lane, and stick to cute girls serving alcohol, leave the restaurant portion alone."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my experience here. Our food was under microwaved and served cold. The Tilted Kilt ambiance was non existent as none of the servers were in uniform. Our bartender, Carl, was the only saving grace. He was a cool guy and upheld a friendly conversation. I likely will visit a Tilted Kilt again, just not this location."}
{"text":"We were in town last weekend for a wedding and attempted to eat here twice. The first time was a Wednesday night and there may have been 15 other people there at the time, all at the bar. There were literally NO tables seated in the entire restaurant. There were 8 of us and we were sat under the big screen, next to a speaker and a sub. There was an amazing mix of hip hop happening, which would have been amazing if we had brought our glow sticks and dancing shoes. Unfortunately, we all just flew into town and hadn't eaten for hours and just wanted to talk over some burgers. We asked the hostess if we could move to the table in the far back corner where there were no speakers. She replied that there wasn't a server for that table. When we asked if our original server could just take us at the other table, she stared at us with a look of confusion and said she didn't think that was possible... we left.  The second time was Sunday around 11:30 am, we were hoping to get a table to watch the Packers & the Chiefs. We approached the host stand where there were 3 gals talking to each other. After a minute or so, one of them acknowledged us and we asked if we could put our name in... she looked very confused and said that there wouldn't be a table until the game ended around 12:45. We told her that wasn't a problem the games we wanted to watch were at 1:30, we would like to put our name on the waitlist. At that time, one of the other gals knocked over the bin of silverware. Our hostess stopped talking to us, mid sentence, laughed and bent down to pick up the silverware and chat with her coworker. We waited. A minute or so later, she stood back up and said there is no waitlist. If we wanted to get a table we had to stand there until one was ready... we left.  Yes, this was the same hostess both times."}
{"text":"Ok food but horrible service. I think it's too much for the servers when they have to serve more than 1 table. Obviously guys go here to stare at the girls, I have no problem with places like this but at least have decent food and good service. It's funny how the reviews that were positive seemed to come almost 90% from guys!!! Haha . I wouldn't go back here because of the quality of food mainly.."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in early on a Tuesday afternoon for a couple of drinks and decided to go back the next day for lunch.  The atmosphere is \"sports bar busyness.\"  Both days we sat at the bar rather than in the dining area.  The bartenders were attentive and friendly.  I ordered the spicy southwest chicken wrap with sweet potato fries and both were awesome!  The fries were cooked perfectly - I like them crispy.  The wrap was filled with chunks of chicken and veggies.  The southwest sauce added the perfect amount of zing.  I also ordered a side of the pre-game fried pickle chips.  The breading on them was super-thin - unlike any I'd had before - and I loved them.  They come with a cayenne mayo (?) dipping sauce that I actually enjoyed with my sweet potato fries.  My husband ordered the black and blue burger - piled high with blue cheese crumbles and onion strings.  The prices of the meals were reasonable ($12.50 for my wrap and $13.50 for the burger) - the drinks a little on the high side ($8 for a 16oz draft beer and $12 for a double Captain Coke).  But given that this is just off the Strip in Vegas, it was to be expected.  Speaking of the location, the LINQ shopping area provided a nice respite from the busyness of the Strip.  There are several places to shop or eat along the area.  It's also close to the High Roller Wheel."}
{"text":"Decent food warm ass beer. When I suggested to the waitress to put some beer on ice she told me that was illegal? I couldn't finish the beer, ordered water and finished my meal before I strangled her manager. Wont ever go back there, its a shame nice tits and ass but that cant help you choke down a hot beer."}
{"text":"I was there on a Friday for lunch with 4 friends from work. 2 of them were there already and were eating. Looking at what they had and what they left on their plates, they were not too enthused by the food. Anyway, my buddy and I both ordered Miller Lites and he ordered a fried chicken salad and I had the bacon-cheese burger which is one of the \"specialties.\" Our bartender/waitress Nicole was great. She kept tabs on us and looked good in the tilted Kilt uniform, which is a lot more than I can say for most of the rest of the staff.  My buddy gets his salad in about 5 minutes, and I am told that mine is \"on the way.\" 25 minutes later, still no burger, and Nicole is obviously getting flustered. I see her talking with a manager, Ben, at the other end of the bar. 10 minutes later, I get my food. Average burger, a bit overdone, and decent fries. And, of course, they forget the ranch dressing on the side that I ordered. I eat about 3/4 of the burger and a few fries, and that's all of the grease that I can handle. I get the bill, and of course the bill has not been adjusted at all for the screw-up that caused me to wait a total of 35 minutes for a burger and fries. And, the manager seemed not to care in the least. I left no tip on the bill, but gave Nicole some cash, as this wasn't her fault.  For any guys that want to ogle average to below-average waitresses in skimpy outfits, this is your place. Anyone else, eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have been to several on the West Coast and by far this has to be the worst one. My first time in Cle and I decided to give this place a try. I wasn't greeted at the door so I decided to sit myself at the bar. It took 5 mins for a bar tender to acknowledge me. However the people next to me were getting serve. I don't know if they were having a bad day or the color of my skin was their issue. I will not recommend my this place to my co-workers from my firm."}
{"text":"I'd love to write a more favorable review, but after visiting the downtown PHX location twice recently, I wasn't impressed. Unlike other like-kind restaurants, the waitresses aren't friendly and service is slow. It took me 12 minutes to get a first beer during my most recent visit.  The waitresses tended to hide back behind the service bar instead of being out on the floor engaging with customers. If you prefer the type of wait staff engagement you might find at orange and white themed restaurants, you'll be disappointed. I wish this location well in addressing their atmosphere and service issues."}
{"text":"I expected the Tilted Kilt to be just another Hooters. Boy was I was wrong. The place is very nice and clean. The waitresses and bartenders were all very friendly, not to mention beautiful. And you can't beat those outfits.  The food was WAY better than Hooters food, and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere Dani is an amazing bartender and can keep a conversation while still paying attention to all the other patron's without skipping a beat and not leaving people feeling ignored A+++ me and my wife really enjoyed coming here and will be back soon to try some food and more drinks all we had this trip was the pretzels with the Guinness beer cheese tasted great .. all smiles :-)"}
{"text":"Food was not very good. They were very disorganized. And the staff was not very friendly. This will be the last time coming to this location. It has went downhill over the past few years and is still going. ."}
{"text":"I go here because everywhere else has a line. I can walk in here at 7 on Saturday night and there are maybe 40 people here. Most of those are at the bar trying to hit on the waiters who are not doing there jobs. The food is OK.  Its frozen food but its just OK.  The waiters are always talking to each other rather paying attention to our needs."}
{"text":"Cute girls and friendly but the cooks needs some training. I got a patty melt and the fries and burger was good but it was on plain sliced white bread NOT toast at all no butter nothing. I blame the management poor training of their kitchen staff. NO WONDER THEY WERE EMPTY ON SUNDAY FOOTBALL"}
{"text":"First off I must say that I love pub food and the Tilted Kilt's menu has a ton of choices.  I only ordered the Chips and Salsa as I had already eaten and I was mainly there to check out the place and visit with some friends.  I tried some of  the food that my friends had and I wished that I had saved room and eaten here as their dishes were fantastic and the other items that I saw being delivered to other tables also looked great too.   The Chips and Salsa were fresh and came with a Big Bowl of salsa so you don't have to buy another side or two of it so that you can have some with each chip.   We went out on a weekend a while ago and the place had a pleasant atmosphere with lot's of TVs so that you can see something from every seat. Not too loud with a good mix of people and the waitress was super friendly too.  I'm not a drinker, but people seemed to like that the there were a lot of good beers to choose from.   We will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night to check if it was up to coming back on a Saturday night to watch UFC fight.  Ordered a burger and fries and a beer, service was slow and beer was warm (and i hate warm beer) and the food was cold by the time it arrived.  Rather go to Twin Peaks where the beer is always served at 28 degrees ( or at least hovers around that temp) and is served in a frosty mug with floating ice crystals all on the top! Probably won't be back since Hooters is around the corner.....maybe they have colder beer??"}
{"text":"This place is a pure disappointment - waitresses (and at last count) there were 7 all grouped together by the kitchen window, talking among themselves.  We waited at least 10 min after being seated before we were even acknowledged.  And then the waitress that took our drink order made sure we understood she was not our waitress.  Ok - got it - but can you bring the drinks?  Drinks followed after another 10 min and they were not even busy.  Finally, one waitress broke loose from the herd and came over to take our order - bless you my child!  Now I am not a prude but those \"costumes\" are not big enough to cover all of the tattoos on the girls - kid you not! It appears that the waitresses were hired based on the amount of ink that would show.  Enough of that - onto the food - bland at best - fries totally cold, burger just okay - only good thing was the cold beer.  Will not return here - way too many places around this location to justify spending money for poor service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Great food,  great service and ice cold beer every time.  I live in a different state but visit the Phoenix area often on business and we always make sure to go to the Kilt,  specifically this location. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"Went here as a first timer. We got seated immediately, and that was it; for about 20-25 min.  We waited for what seemed like to be an eternity. FINALLY, we got service. Food was very good. Highly recommend the fried pickles. If you decide to come, be prepared; you may wait for a awhile"}
{"text":"Cooks need to step up their game.  I didn't expect much, but serving me a rubber mat when asked for medium?  At least be considerate and give me medium well!  The whole table got well done instead of medium. Guess I should have asked for Rare or raw. 1 star because of zero isn't possible.  Our waitress tried her best, but during happy hour I'd expect the usual 5-10 minute courtesy last minute call.  I would imagine that is basic knowledge as a waitress.  Obviously the reason I was here was because of my party and them wanting to come for the \"view\". Well you will definitely get that and that's about it."}
{"text":"Went to the Tilted Kilt on Sunday morning to watch the NFL games.  Free parking was available on the surrounding streets.  There were also several parking garages within a block of the restaurant.  The restaurant is located on the second floor of the building at 2 East Jefferson.  Look for the escalator.  We arrived at kickoff, and there were plenty of tables in the main dining area and seats at the bar.  I was with a group of friends from the Bay Area, so we found the Raiders-Texans game and got a table.  The breakfast menu is limited to four choices.  We chose the Tilted Kilt Breakfast: three eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, toast.  Our food came out within five minutes of ordering.  It was pretty good.  There are plenty of TVs all over the restaurant, so it is easy to find your game.  The Tilted Kilt girls were friendly, and looked great in the mini plaid skirts.  The Raiders beat the Texans in a close game!!  After the game most of our group left, so there were only three of us remaining.  We noticed three open seats at the bar.  We closed our tab, and moved to the bar for the afternoon games.  I enjoyed sitting at the bar more than the dining area.  The bar has five TVs side by side so you can watch five games at once.  If you play fantasy football, being at the bar is the perfect spot.  For the afternoon games, we ordered Irish Nachos, the cheesesteak salad, the bbq bacon cheeseburger, and beer.  The salad and burger were good, but we were disappointed in the nachos.  The food is above average.  The beer is cold.  The girls are pretty, and there are plenty of TVs.  We had a blast watching our games!  If I'm ever in Phoenix during an NFL weekend, I will return to the Tilted Kilt."}
{"text":"My and 2 friends used to visit this Kilt once a week for happy hour.  The girls were cute and friendly and the beer was reasonably priced.  Since then, tthey have had a general manager change (Judy was the best GM in the food business but had to leave for medical reasons).  We each ordered a large bud light.  I fell off my chair when the bartender told us the price had been increased to $7.08 (with tax) for one domestic beer.  The wait staff seems to have a high turnover rate, the newest girls had guts that made me look skinny.  The 3 girls working this past Saturday apparently have never seen a salad or a treadmill.   They hardly could squeeze into their kilts.  We departed, walked over to hooters for $5 large beers."}
{"text":"Been to this one and the one in chandler...  Both times i realized something, all waitress' that work here need to have at least 5 bruises on their legs to begin their work shift.  The service is always bad and I think a tranny brought us a couple beers one time. Not sure though. (which isn't a bad thing.....she was hotter than most the wait staff)  Haven't had the food because I was coming off a bender both times I went. Greasy bar food did not sound good at all.  Ill just go somewhere else and get more than 2 beers in an hour."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday with some friends from work, this would be my first and ONLY visit to this dump. I'll skip over all the minor details that made this experience dreadful and get right to business. I ordered a glass of moscato, waitress brings it. It has this slightly sweet, intensely bitter/corked taste to it. Not good. I ask the waitress to check with the bartender to make sure he poured moscato. She comes back, claiming she saw the bottle herself and that it's moscato. Um ok, guess ill suffer thru this nasty wine. About 2/3 of the way done with it, I look down into my glass and see a white sediment in the glass, bf sticks a finger in and what do you know!! It's a puddle of sugar!! I ask for the manager. He comes over and tells me he's so sorry but they had run out of moscato and instead of telling me- the bartender gave me a glass of Chardonnay and poured SUGAR INTO IT!!! This place has disgusting business practices and I will never be back here. You need to be honest with your customers and I asked that waitress to double check- they had an out at that point to fix their bs. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE PLACE! The service sucked, the food sucked and as far as I'm concerned they only want your money and will blatantly lie to you to get it."}
{"text":"Nice location love the ladies. But food was just not that good tried their chicken pasta which was runny and just plain. Mushrooms weren't cooked thoroughly and the mashed potatoes were awful. I will come back just to give the chef another try. The only three things I loved was the ladies, TV's, and steak."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. A good place for drinks before the game but that's about it. A quick bite to fill your stomach but don't expect anything special. And of course, the scenery is nice."}
{"text":"I feel like a total idiot for posting a harsh review on a totally different restaurant! One that I have yet to eat at. For that I am sorry! I'll update this review as soon as I make a visit here!"}
{"text":"The \"uniforms\" are cool - great if you are coming from a game or going to a game. However for downtown Cleveland it is expensive and really not all that good. I will be going back eventually though!!"}
{"text":"First of all ew, second it was a Friday and it was not packed at all service was slow,the girls were not dimes and it was just a sad depressing place to go,had to walk out a few minutes after being seated because they wanted to take forever to ask us what we wanted to drink,sad sad place do not go."}
{"text":"I went here over an hour before a Pirates game I was going to.  The waitresses are friendly, although not wearing much.  Some were very pretty and the outfits worked for them.  Others looked awful.  Waitress got our orders quickly, and then we waited 30-45 minutes before she came to our table to tell us our food should be out shortly.  Another 15 minutes passed before she came and asked us if we were going to the game (which then started in 5 minutes) and asked if we wanted to cancel our order and just leave.    No manager came over, and there was only a meek apology from the waitress.  It wasn't her fault though.  The restaurant was packed when we got there, but by the time we left, there was just a few tables.  We did not order anything elaborate either (a burger and a chicken wrap).  So I have no idea what the issue was.  I can not comment on the quality of the food because I didn't get to eat it, but it seemed pretty generic and probably a little overpriced.  They did seem to have a decent beer selection, but not anything you couldn't find somewhere else."}
{"text":"I know. Large chain and probably not good but the fish and chips were excellent. The fish batter was crispy and the fish was moist and flaky. Very well cooked indeed and it is not easy to get that right."}
{"text":"Went to Tilted Kilt in Paradise Valley and sat with Tazlyn. Food was great. Drinks were strong. Service was the best. Plan on going there again and often."}
{"text":"What red blooded 'murican man doesn't love white knee highs and short plaid skirts? I mean seriously this is the single equation to a successful bar."}
{"text":"I was really excited about my first trip to this Irish Pub themed restaurant. The service was good. My girlfriend and I and her sister  sat in the bar area, we were greeted sat down and ordered our drinks. Drinks came quickly and the beer selection is great. Now the bad news. We ordered clam strips and the garlic fries for appetizers. Both came out quickly but that was all that was good. The fries and strips were both greasy, I mean oil lining the bottom of the baskets. The fries were nothing special, seasoned with garlic salt and a sprinkle of parmesan  cheese. You could make better at home. I ordered  the sausage and mash with mustard maple vinaigrette. First of all what were they thinking with that dressing combo...The mashed potatoes were made from powder and the sausage was Italian.... Italian sausage in a \"want to be Irish Pub\" ???? My girlfriend and  her sister had the grilled chicken and vegetables...Neither ate all their meals and we took the remainder home for the pets. I will not be back. A nice bar but a very poor restaurant... and there are plenty of other bars to choose from."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. Not busy really but the barmaid was attentive and friendly. Tried the Irish Stew - wasn't quite what I expected but was tasty. Shredded beef in the stew, not cubes, but the taste was pretty Irish old school - I should know had a girlfiend for years from Ireland - almost the same taste. Tried the Four Peaks I.P.A. draft brew - that was really different and very good - a little pricey at $6.50 a pint but I thought it was worth it. Probably get a different, more lively clientele for gametime, etc. If Hooters is where you're setting the bar for this type of place, it's better."}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff, our bartender Nina was outgoing and friendly. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"A great place with electric energy.. The atmosphere enjoyable, the food delicious and the scenery something you have to see. A definite must do when in downtown Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a guy hang out. Sure, I like the boob fest. But, I want a beer and I want it cold. This they provide. Prices are a little on the high side. Decor is ok. Seats are hard on the butt if your there for a game. Speaking of which they have lots of big screens for your viewing pleasure.  I didn't sit on the outdoor patio, some boob was smoking a cigar are trying to impress, I guess.  Anyway, the one real positive here were the wings which they serve as grilled or fried. Go for the grilled wings: some of the best I've had in a long time. I ate the shepherd's pie for dinner: survey says? 2 stars. It reminded me of a can of sloppy joe mixed with some frozen veggies. That took be back to my college days.  The beer was cold. $3.00 for a well draft at happy hour. Not bad, not great. Service was very average. I had to flag the waitress down to get our dinner order.  But the beer was cold and it was 110 outside.  Anyway, I used to go here a lot when I lived in the 'hood and it first opened. Service was really good, food was good and the prices were good. Now, I wouldn't really bother unless it was to meet someone to go somewhere else. One beer and I'm outta there.  Maybe a good place to see a game. I can think of 10 other placed I would rather go to watch a game than here. And, too many men. It's like a dumbed down version of Hooters except the food is a little better."}
{"text":"We came to Pittsburgh from Buffalo hoping to have some good food before the Pirates game. We were in this restaurant for over an hour before our food came out. When it did, the sandwiches were not prepared as described on the menu. We requested a manager at that point and he failed to come over. They comped all our food but needless to say we didn't have time to eat nor did we want to at that point. They truly need to work on the service. And by the way they were not busy. Hmmm...."}
{"text":"I decided to dropped by with my lady friend for a PPV event UFC 202. Had a great time, lots of beer, greasy food, and lots of eye candy. Cover charge was $20.00. Waitress was very attentive. Food meh not so great, actually pretty mediocre. Enough said. If you're in Las Vegas and have an itch for some PPV UFC action with lots of beer and eye candy, say no more Tilted Kilt is your spot."}
{"text":"Last football season, our group ate here a lot because they're one of the only places in the Linq that plays sound for at least one of the games. The food portions, especially with regard to the burgers, was ample. And there were also some good choices for what's on tap. It wasn't inexpensive, but prices weren't outrageous either.  This time however, during happy hour on Sunday for game day; the burgers we were served were a sad shadow of last years in portion and accompanying fries. Bland fries and sparse toppings for the burger. The beer, of which I got the monthly special so it was a dollar off, was $11 a glass. The service was about what you'd expect on a crowded game day, but for waiting as long as we did for our order there should have been more on the plate.  The waitresses were still barely clad; but not bare midriff or amount of cleavage can distract from the fact that we got taken."}
{"text":"It was an average experience until I asked one of the bartenders what drink had just been made for some woman.   \"That's a Mai Tai\" she responded. \"How are they?\", I asked. \"Too sweet, I don't like sweet drinks\", she returned. \"Me neither\" I said, continuing to ask \"Do you know of any good sour drinks? I feel like something tart\". \"I don't like sour drinks either\" is what I got back.  So I guess the customer isn't allowed to have subjective taste, because she definitely wasn't going to ask one of the other bartender's, though she was fine with making the other woman a Mai Tai.   After several minutes of being ignored, I ordered a shot of tequila, only to watch her serve six plastic cups of beer to other people as they came and ordered them before I went to another bartender and cashed out.  I don't know what happened, but fuck it, what ever it was."}
{"text":"Great food and great cans on all the girls. Only complaint was one of my fries was a rotten potato, but wow I was to busy checking out the racks on these Angels. Great place to take the family or just get hammered! Will defiantly be back! Better than hooters!"}
{"text":"Decent lunch, but not recommended on a Monday after the beers have been depleted over the weekend.  Yes a boobs and beer joint. Better than the one downtown. The food is decent."}
{"text":"So I considered myself a regular here. A group of us would come the same day every week on a regular basis...then we stopped...the service is horrible! We enter and seat ourselves at the bar area, three servers walk by and haven't even said anything to us. After waiting 10 minutes we stepped over to the bar and ordered our drinks. A server finally stopped by and was surprised to see us sitting at our table. She asked when we came in an we told her about 6 passes by and 15 minutes ago. We ordered chips and salsa which took another 15 minutes. One of the servers literally just rotated from guy to guy around the bar. At one point I thought she was stoned based on her appearance and complete ignorance to any patrons around her. She served no one except for possibly the beyond hammered guy at the end of the bar.   I want to really like this place as I have been to other locations but this one makes it tough. I am giving it a two only because drinks are reasonably priced...that's about it! I thought that with their boss being on undercover boss might help but sorely it has not taken effect at this location. This location might need some staff turnover."}
{"text":"While out and about last Sunday and needing some grub, the gf and I stopped by for a bite.  I've been to many TK's and as usual, great aesthetics :-) and atmosphere.  The game was on and the crowd rowdy.  Both good things.  I had the chicken fried chicken...was good but the portion was small.  A lot of the plate was taken up by steamed veggies that really no one wants if you're eating chicken fried chicken.   Obviously not looking for a healthy diet if I order this, right?.  But all in all, it was good.  My gf ordered a chicken tender wrap.  I had a bite and it was good.  She wasn't impressed.  The waitress stopped by and relayed her less than enthusiastic response to the manager who then stopped by our table.  It was obvious from the start that he wanted her to be happy.  He asked questions, made multiple offers and then prepared her a whole new entrée (the way we at the restaurant eat it, he said).  She was indeed pleased with the new meal.  Kudos to this establishment, the staff and the manager.  In a world where customer service has taken a back seat to a \"like it or leave it\" attitude, these folks kick a__!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, was taken aback by the server girls' outfits (felt I walked into a brothel, pub-style). Drinks and wings were all my party of three had, and it ended up being $93... completely over-priced. Particularly as one girl suggested we do a double-shot with the Summersby to replace the Strongbow one of us wanted... It ended up being $20 for that one drink. WTF? No drink is worth that unless you're paying for higher end champagne!"}
{"text":"We went to watch NFL Sunday morning. We had breakfast and Bloody Mary's. The food was okay nothing special. The Bloody Mary's were the worst I have ever had. The only flavor was A1 sauce. If you want to drink A1 sauce and vodka then this drink is for you. All of the TVs and atmosphere was good. Servers were friendly and pretty attentive even thought they were really busy."}
{"text":"I don't know how I can express this to the full extent I am hoping to but I'll give it a shot.  I think the \"sandwich\" I ordered, the \"fat bastards meatloaf\" something, Is quite possibly the WORST $10.99 I have spent in my 27 years on this planet.  I am in no way a picky eater and rarely criticize restaurants, but this shit is inexcusable.  My diet usually consists of pub type food, burgers, reubens etc, so I know my meatloaf sandwichs.  This folks, was no kind of meat I want to try again.  Not only did this poor excuse for a sandwich not taste anything like meatloaf, the meat had ZERO flavor and the consistency of soaking wet, undercooked cooked ground beef.  It was was absolutely terrible.  How hard to you have to try to fuck up a meatloaf sandwich?!!  The fucking fries weren't even good!  And the Guiness BBQ sauce tasted like ladies perfume, weird eh?  The beer even tasted weak, which I can't stand, and the place looks like a Fridays that's going out of business in an hour.  The only positive I found at Tilted Kilt was the waitress working the bar section.  She was built like a brick shithouse and kept leaning over to clean tables.  Short skirt + hot female + Purposefully leaning a to far over = 1/2 star.  Also, the TV's are very high quality and you have a good view from anywhere at the bar (another half star).  That's it.  And now that I think about it, that girl could have been 17 years old for all I know, kind of makes me feel like a creeper.  Please, for the health and safety of you intestinal tract, avoid this place at all costs.  If you are going to watch a game, maybe this is an ok stop to check out the young tail working there, but I would find somewhere else. Damn it, even after typing this I'm still pissed off!"}
{"text":"Horrible! It was cooler outside. A/C was off and they wouldn't put it on. Service sucked and place was empty.Left after one drink. One would think a big party was a priority. Left and went next door to Jerome Bettis', place packed, seated right away, and the A/C was on!!!"}
{"text":"It's what I expected. A Hooter's with plaid skirts and a bunch of married men getting drunk and staring at college girls."}
{"text":"Do not recommend. Service seemed uninterested with us. Advertised happy hour on website was not acknowledged and $6 pints. When we asked about the happy hour we were told we were wrong and not to listen to the own companies website. Server said since it's not on the menu then it doesn't exist."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try one, they don't have a TK up where i am from NorCal. All i can say was WOW. This place made Hooters seem like McDonald's.  First off, the food was very good for a pub/sports bar spot, with an actual menu. The staff was not only beautiful, no attitudes and they actually knew how to serve and take care of their customers. The place had a great vibe and me and the boys will definitely be back! Our waitress was a total pro!"}
{"text":"In competition with the three other pubs along this stretch of The Esplanade, we were hoping for similar quality and service but unfortunately, we were let down.  The servers are very nice looking, friendly, and definitely not shy about showing off their assets, but service could be improved. When our food arrived, no cutlery nor serviettes were brought . . . we had to ask our server.  Speed of service was what you would expect, no better no worse.  Food quality could be greatly improved.  Reasonably priced, but the taste, freshness, and seasoning just wasn't there.  Fries were soggy, which is definitely a bad sign...pubs SHOULD know how to do fries and the ones that don't, you can probably be sure that the rest of the menu is equally mediocre.  I'd be willing to go back for drinks since there is a good bar scene and with the nicer weather, patio seating.  But I'd probably eat elsewhere before or after."}
{"text":"Wow, this was shocking.  Walked in at 930 , no hostess...several of the waitresses saw us walk in (party of 7). We decided to seat ourselves.  Sat in patio and waited 10 minutes, decided to get our own menus.  When getting the menus they said someone was coming out.....nope.  Waited another 15.  Went in and saw all the waitresses stuffing their face w chicken wings, it was disgusting.  Asked if anyone was going to come out and serve us.  The two waitresses gnawing on chicken bones began arguing about who was going to wait on us.  It was pathetic.....asked speak to the manager who was equally pathetic. THe guy offered to take care of us, to which i respond ...take care of ur service...ur missing the point dum dum!  Won't be going back and will spread the word to every single person in the valley to not go to this establishment.  There was reason it was completely dead on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"I lived in center Phoenix and frequently visited the TK there, is was always a great place to go.  I recently moved to Tempe, and this TK is about a block from my house.  Now, I understand that anyone can have a bad night, but three times??? I gave the place a second and third chance, not friendly, and terrible service.  I feel like it is an inconvenience to the waitresses to have customers.  Very bad culture there.  So, I just looked up the rating on yelp, and yep, this location has the lowest rating.  Funny, since the headquarters sits in the same parking lot.  Avoid this one!  Enjoy the rest..."}
{"text":"What a DUMP! If you think this place is good you either (a) have had very little life experience outside of Maricopa County or (b) have little or no taste. How can a restaurant mess up Irish pub food? Answer: Tilted Kilt found a way. OFTEN.  It's bad enough this place is filled with servers who look like cheap Arizona hookers walking the Van Buren stroll (nice and respectful of women, I might add). But even worse - SOME GIRLS DON'T BELONG IN SKIMPY OUTFITS LIKE THAT! Management needs to get some glasses and a new menu.  Disgusting on every level."}
{"text":"Good time, kind of quiet for a Saturday night, but lots of TV's. Classy hostess outfits =)"}
{"text":"Slow and confused service. The server said that they weren't given trays to carry drinks. She must have said \"sorry\" about 30 times (it loses meaning after 5 I find) and blamed mismanagement. The food was very mediocre, bordering bad. The outfits they wear appear to be modeled after a 14 year old boy's fantasy. Never again."}
{"text":"Average place. Nothing to write home about. Girls were dressed like it was an Irish hooters which was fun."}
{"text":"An ok bar with good comfort bar food. Very busy when I was there and service was slow. Good tvs for sports. Try it out and judge for yourself this OK spot."}
{"text":"I only gave it one star because I couldn't go below that. The worst place I've ever been. 2 hours to get bar food. There had to be fully open table so it wasn't as though they were that busy."}
{"text":"Where to begin? Hmm. Went here with a large group of friends to watch the ASU vs. UofA game for the territorial cup. We were there for about 4 hours total, and for the first hour and 15 minutes we got to speak to our waitress exactly once. She took our initial drink order, delivered some beverages and then disappeared like a magician's assistant. When we managed to draw her attention after that obscenely long period of time to order food it took over half an hour to get anything. This included an order of chips and salsa - something which is prepared by putting chips in a basket and pouring salsa into a bowl. When the food was delivered, it came out unaccompanied by the cocktails we had ordered. When we remarked on this, we were told the bar had run out of glasses and we would get our drinks as soon as they were cleaned. Our drinks were eventually delivered a while later and we managed to enjoy the game for a little while. During the game we had a few different waitresses come up to us to deliver a bowl of soup we hadn't ordered, a beer we hadn't ordered, three orders of chips and salsa we hadn't ordered (presumably to make up for the fact that the first order had taken almost 40 minutes to get to our table), and two rum and cokes we didn't order. Upon learning that these cocktails weren't ours, the waitress who brought them decided to leave them sitting on the hostess stand which was near our table. A little bit later, one of my friends decided to order 4 \"Belfast Booms\" which is the Tilted Kilt's version of an Irish Car Bomb. These were delivered as follows - the waitress first brought out 4 shots of Bailey's Irish Cream with no whiskey mixed in. The shots came out in two glass shot glasses, one plastic disposable shot glass, and one cocktail glass with an inch of Irish cream sitting in the bottom. She then said she would be right back.  We assumed she was going back to get the glasses of Guinness the shots are supposed to be mixed with but apparently she didn't know that's how the drink is served because she didn't come back for about 15 minutes with the beers. The beer glasses (per the description on the menu) were supposed to have a half pint of Guinness to drop the shots in. They actually came out with quite a bit less - a level low enough that dropping the shot glasses into the beer would have left the level of beer below the top of the shot glass. What was even more amusingly odd was the one drink served with the plastic shot glass - as an experiment we dropped the shot into the Guinness in and confirmed what we thought would happen - the plastic shot glass did not fall into the beer, it floated on top of the foam head. By the end of the evening, we got to the point where we were just amused by the utter incompetence and complete indifference we saw in every aspect of the service we received. I personally was confused by the fact that our waitress did not seem at all interested in serving a table that had close to 20 customers - why would you not try to give good service to such a large group that would (presumably) be the source of a large tip?  My portion of the bill was over $40, so if you do the math, she was risking 15-20% of a roughly $700-$800+ bill. My confusion was alleviated when we received our bills and found that while we were being billed individually, the restaurant treated the bills as if they were for a single large bill and automatically added the gratuity (18%) to the total.  It's really a shame because the food was pretty good, but not good enough to entice me to ever return there again."}
{"text":"This place had horrible service! The 3 of us sat down at the bar & did not even get  noticed. 15 minutes go by I finally had to ask the bartender for a menu because she was too busy flirting with the guys. I understand she needs to make her tips, but at least offer us a drink or even say hey guys I'll be with in just a moment is what a normal server should do. Needless to say we ended up leaving as we would of dry hive & starve of hunger sitting there. I ask to speak to the manager just to let him aware of the situation & his response was I can sit you back down now. We greatly appreciate the tilted kilt in our home town of Temecula!! Never again will I come to the one in Vegas that's for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a black & tan and got a blended brew. Bar tender needs to learn some basics on pours."}
{"text":"So I went here with a friend after spending a sweltering day apartment hunting in Chandler. I was hot, irritated, and in need of a cold beer and somewhere to hang for awhile. It was late on a Sunday afternoon, and I was parked at Home Depot across the street so I walked there. In other words, my expectations were low already, shouldn't be hard to please me right? Ha...  As we approached the door, we were greeted by a chalkboard sign showcasing the featured beer of the month. August's beer of the month: Bud Light. Wtf. Already I am rethinking this place, but we're thirsty so we go in.  Teeny tiny shirts and skirts on the waitresses: yeah, not my favorite part of the place. My male friend agreed, but you walk in knowing what you're getting into, so whatever. Skanky, dirty, sticky, food-coated bar during a lull with no customers: also, not so much a fan. Chose a seat and had to move because I didn't want to put my arms down on the counter.  The encounter with the bartender went roughly as follows: My friend: So, the beer of the month is... Bud Light? Really?  Bartender: Yep, Bud Light. (straight, serious face) Friend: Uh, yeah, because clearly Bud Light is the best beer ever. Bartender: Well, it is the best beer ever. I mean, it's my favorite beer. (still serious face, but now slightly defensive tone for mocking his beer-love.) Friend: Right. So I guess I'll just have a Miller Lite then.  It's not a horrible place, and I'm sure I'll end up back there. I just think documentation is necessary when a bartender says his favorite beer is Bud Light."}
{"text":"This was my first visit at Tilted Kilt. Me and my friend were there for lunch. it was pretty busy for lunch ( i don't know how though). As soon as we sat down the server asked us for drinks and everything was good so far. They changed shifts AND OUR SERVER CHANGED our server looked like she just woke up and came to work after a long night of partying, just looked like she didn't want to be there. Another thing i noticed is that there were only dudes in there ( literally no girl customer in there what so ever ). We ordered the food and it was CRAP ( not edible food) we ordered as follows:  1. Black bean wrap- Great vegetarian option but it was too dry, not tasty at all seemed like it was sitting for a while so it  was chewy and very pricy ( not worth it )  2. Irish nachos- Their signature item, I don't eat beef so i got it replaced for chicken. There was not enough cheese on it and you could not even tell there was chicken on it. the taste was blend and just seemed disgusting.  3. Wings with signature sauce- seems like i was eating shredded chicken ( either it was way too soft or that was not chicken ) it was not cooked well either. i would rather have gone to BWW to eat a meal. overall it was CRAPY wings  4. Garlic Fries- they said this was one of there best selling dish, i don't know how, but to me there was more grease then fries itself just disgusting .  we are just so out of it, seems like this restaurant ( irish pub & eatery) concentrates more on how sluty there waitress should look then the food. THIS FRANCHISE WILL NOT SURVIVE FOR LONG TIME, THEY WILL CLOSE SOON. If you want to have fun here then drink over priced beer and look at some tits, but i rather do that at a strip club where i can actually see their tits for a price. I would suggest you to find a better place to go then this 'BREASTURANT'"}
{"text":"Came here a few months back, walked in straight to the bar, asked for a bottle of beer, i waited 10 minutes literally and still didnt get it. How hard is it to pull out a beer, not even asking them to fill a pint, its grabbing a bottle of beer from the bottom.."}
{"text":"yes the girls are smoking hot, but......... not very imperssed by this place, ive had better in Texas. the happy hour \"slider\" was a joke $4 for a lil meatball in a bun. food took way to long for a empty place. tourist rip off."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday night not even half full and our service was soon slow, couldn't even get silverware. Food mediocre at best and the pulled pork was dry and tasteless. Would not recommend especially with all the other choices in town."}
{"text":"ok, so even as a chic, I like this place.  food is not bad (not great either), but the staff are great.  great beers, specials and did I mention the outfits??  I need one of those..."}
{"text":"Spent July 4, 2015 here. Good food great service from our server JENNA!! Jenna is energetic, intelligent, fun and made sure we had a great time."}
{"text":"grade A+ service by Blair and Caitlin enough said.Caitlin was very attentive and catered to my wants respectfully. Blair was very polite and ask if need any assistance ."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, it was sort of empty, and we went for food and the sound of the music system was blaring and somewhat disrupted what we were there to do, visit.  And I didn't care for the choice of music much either.  Obviously they have good beers and decent table service.  I liked the chicken strips in the salad, it was a little bit better than I expected since this doesn't look like a place that would be known for its food.   Prices were reasonable, parking good, a few adjustments and it make make a good business lunch spot-- doesn't appear that the other customers were the swinging single types (for lunch), some had kids."}
{"text":"I came in here by myself for lunch a few weeks ago. I was in the mood for fish and chips. I wasn't sure how they would treat a woman by herself in a place that caters to men. They couldn't have been nicer and more attentive.  Great fish and chips and very lovely girls. Thanks TK!"}
{"text":"Went in after work to try it out to be my new Thursday football destination. Let's just say I'm still looking. I walk in to be met by about 6 girls and the manager. I tell them I'm just going to sit at the bar and they didn't say much more to me. Get to the bar and the bartender introduces herself to me. She's very nice and explains the happy hour prices. I go with a domestic draft beer because they are on special.   The beer comes and it's cold but not beer cold. I'm waiting for the bartender to come back to put in a food order but she never does because frankly she is too busy. She is working the whole bar and patio by herself. I look over at the front to still see the 6 girls standing around doing nothing. The bartender is taking care of 95% of the customers while the other six flirt with a small group of customers. So needless to say I didn't order food. I finish my beer and the bartender is back right away to refill it. So she's awesome but just too much going on.   Lastly the bar is dirty. It was not clean at all and honestly the place looks unfinished. At first I though the bathroom door was locked but soon discovered I had to put my shoulder into it.  The girls were not cute enough to deal with all the negatives."}
{"text":"So tried this tilted kilt as it's newer and has a nice setup to watch sports. The server I had was not the fastest in the world but I wasn't expecting fast service. But that is not the real problem.   Ordered chicken strips which came out in a decent speed. Took a bite and noticed something was wrong. The chicken was still wrapped in Saran Wrap but had still been seasoned and cooked. Got my servers attention and explained what was wrong. Her response was   \"yeah our cooks are always high as fuck\"  and then she walked off. No apology, didn't clear the food, just walked away from the problem. Well I walked away as well and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this a 2 because the food was good.  We (us and another couple) had the calamari and spinich dip.  They listed Thirsty Thursday's special as a bucket of Santan Canned Beer as an all day Thursday special.  When we ordered this special on our second round our waitress came back and informed us they they did not offer this special anymore because they no longer carried this beer and hadn't for quite some time.  When we inquired as to why it was still listed on the menu showing daily specials she brought the manager over.  She apologized and offered to discount our drinks for the \"rest of the night\".  Side note that no one took the rest of these special menus off any of the other tables. The guys cashed out and went to run and errand.  Us girls stayed behind to chat over another drink(s).  When the guys got back and we cashed out the bill was not adjusted according to our discounted price as stated by the manager earlier.  When we brought this to our waitress's attention she left and the GM Richard showed up to explain that there had been a \"miscommunication\" from the other manager and he was the General Manager and unfortunately they could not extend this offer\".  After he left and we chatted about the incident we asked the waitress who the Regional Manager was, when she left to get this info the first manager came over and apologized telling us that yes she had offered to discount our drinks and left to take our bill and adjust it accordingly.  The guys agreed they preferred the Tempe location, better service, curvier waitstaff."}
{"text":"I am new to Phoenix and literally live around the corner from this restaurant. I'm thinking \"Wow, great to have this place just around the corner.\" I couldn't have been more wrong. On arrival I sat at the bar which I prefer as service is usually more prompt. It was steady but not what you would call busy. The server Susie started out nice and friendly, promptly serving a diet coke as ordered. The diet coke tasted a bit funny so I double checked with her to make sure it was a diet coke. She offered to get me another from the other side of the restaurant so I said fine. Well, 5-10 minutes later she returned, sans diet coke, and said they were changing out the other line. She walked away and began serving other people and didn't bother to say if or when she would return with another drink. I should have realized at this point that things would only go south but I remained optimistic.  After about 5 minutes I managed to get her attention and politely asked her to just switch it out with iced tea.She dumped the diet coke and 10 minutes later -- nothing. She was on the other side of the bar, flirting with 2 gentleman who she obviously knew or waited on frequently. Finally the other bartender, Megan, came around and asked if she could help. I requested an iced tea which she promptly served me. She looked puzzled as she knew I had been there a while and had been waited on by Susie but she didn't say anything else. Susie finally pulled herself away from her \"friends\" and passed by me and noticed I had my iced tea. She simply said \" Oops, I forgot. I'm glad to see she (Megan) got your iced tea.\" No apology or \"I'm sorry\" ever came from her lips. Another 20 minutes passed by and I'm still waiting for the meal I ordered. Susie, in the meantime, is flirting with her customers, presumably showing off her ample cleavage in search of bigger tips. Megan passed by once more and asked how things were. I told her, politely, that the service was horrible and that Susie was not providing any type of decent customer service at all and that I had now been waiting for my food for 30 minutes. I explained that this was my first visit [and most likely my last]. Megan was very apologetic and went to check on my food. Finally, 10 minutes later I received my Shepard's Pie from Susie who pretty much ignored me from that point on. Thank goodness there was a spoon in it as I had not received any silverware. I reached over the counter myself to get the salt and pepper. 10 minutes went by and as Susie passed I asked her if they had any napkins at the bar. I mean really? Long story short, I waited way too long for my food in a not very busy restaurant. The main dish itself was OK but the Parmesan bread was very dry and tough. When you consider the terrible customer service and long wait it surely was not worth my time or money. I am so disappointed as I thought I might have found a good spot to eat after work since it's so close by but unfortunately this was not to be the case. I'm thinking, having sat at the bar, maybe if I had ordered a higher profit item such as beer or liquor I might have gotten better service?? I guess I'll never find out :("}
{"text":"This Tilted Kilt is always busy when I go. The waitresses are not as friendly as they should be, and twice my order has been messed up. I give them at least three stars cause they have a lot of tvs and one big projector screen, good for watching football."}
{"text":"Hooters pretending to be a pub. I think I'll stick to actual, proper pubs where you won't get shitty service if you don't have a dick just because the servers can't flirt their way into your pocket."}
{"text":"The location and outdoor seating is the best thing going for this place. Very slow service, over priced beer, they served us with  plastic cups and utensils which was pretty lousy considering we paid $8-9 for a beer and $9 for a lame plate of nachos which consisted of chips, partially melted cheese and cheese sauce, chopped tomatoes and black olives. I found the outfits the poor waitresses have to wear in very poor taste. Don't waste your time here!"}
{"text":"Not even sorry the wings were pretty good but and the server was great however management was horrible since we had a problem with our foods taste and instead of at least listening to our concerns they explained to us they wouldn't be able to fix the taste. Over all the manager was a husky white male who was very condescending to us and that is why we are rating this place one star since management was horrible. I will never step foot in there again."}
{"text":"Very Poor service and average to below average food for the price.  Don't order the wings cause it is a rip off too.  I went to the Frank Lloyd/Bell and Scottsdale Rd location and order the 10$ wings and I thought I would get around 12 wings but only got 7 and when ask server she said that they weigh 1lbs and that is it.  After taxes and tip I paid 2$ a wing.  Now that is a Rip Off!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite after work places to go! The bartenders and all the girls are super nice!!!"}
{"text":"Came with another friend (girl) and waitress Ash C. only came to ask for our order and of we needed the check. Then she took 20 minutes to get our check to us. She walked by multiple times too as we were waiting. I've never been so mad and I've never not tipped but this was ridiculous. Will not be returning. Average food too. Don't come here if you're not a guy because they obviously don't care about doing their job properly if you're a girl."}
{"text":"The service sucks, anything that wasn't deep fried wasn't edible.   In a more or less empty restaurant (1 other table) it took 15 min to get our drink order taken, another 15 min before our server came back with drinks and promptly dumped one on the table soaking 3 people. Our food then took another 45 min for 3 salads and some boneless wings. The salads were inedible as all the greens were not just wilted but actually rotting, and the \"boneless wings\" were literally cut up chicken tenders..."}
{"text":"The bartender on the 2nd of November 2017 had the best attitude. Lots of energy and made the night fun"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out. Great happy hour deals on drinks. Sausage sampler was good and the burgers too."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what the problem is with the other reviews but we had dinner here on a Sunday evening around 7pm and we found the service to be quite pleasant.   Our server was always attentive and friendly, the burgers by the way are to die for.  The two males at the table ordered burgers, and we both enjoyed them, the ladies ordered wings and nachos - both were also very good.  We ordered a salad to go for my friends daughter and the server was even nice enough to place the dressing on the side so the salad doesn't get 'soggy', and keep it fresher.  This place (and our pretty little Asian server) gets two thumbs up.  I'll have to visit again to try the boneless wings..."}
{"text":"Horrible! My boyfriend & I went there today for lunch & were the first customers there. I ordered the Shepherd's Pie & he ordered Mozzarella Sticks.  After 20 minutes of waiting we got our food but it was COLD. I might as well have opened a can of Dinty Moore & ate right out of the can & the mozzarella inside the sticks were not at all melted. Not impressed. I never write reviews but felt I had to today."}
{"text":"We were seated right away, got our drinks right away and our food was very good.   Great customer service and great food. I had fish tacos and my husband had wings.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to hold a fantasy draft.  TK on Cactus set us up well for the 4th year in a row.  They had the patio ready for the dozen of us; internet and electrical access, NCAA games on the flat screens.  Good food, cold beer, great service on busy night.  Nick called in extra help when they got slammed.  We were there quite  awhile -- Katie, Lauren, Lindsey, Sandra, and our draft diva Leeandra -- thanks very much.   Book us on the patio 360 days from now."}
{"text":"The next restaurant of this franchise opened near the Pittsburgh airport. Honestly, the food was average and the service was average to poor. They do hire reasonably attractive women who are not wearing a whole lot,, however. They've been open for two weeks and it was almost full when I went for lunch, and my waitress told me it's been like that since they opened.   I went with another guy and the crowd was 90% male. I do imagine that many women would feel somewhat uncomfortable in a place like this, and men could get in trouble  for the natural gawking that is tacitly encouraged at a place like this. So bottom line is this place matches expectations just right.   The prices are a little higher than I'd expect for bar food and I didn't see any Happy Hour Specials. Maybe they'll have more after they are open for a while. You can get a free appetizer by signing up at tiltedkilt.com for their 'kilt club'."}
{"text":"Service was not what it should be at a restaurant (but I suppose it doesn't have to be in Vegas, since business will come anyway). Worse, wings were actually cold. Do yourself a favor and skip this joint."}
{"text":"The WORST \"service\" I have EVER had in my LIFE. I arrived at 5:15pm and was seated at the bar. We received our drinks, menus, napkins with silverware at 5:30pm. We were not spoken to until 10:15pm. Yes, that was 4 hours and 45 minutes later ! We were totally ignored for 4 hours and 45 minutes with our watered down drinks, menus, and rolled up silverware in napkins sitting on the bar in front of us. Not a word was spoken to us by ANY employee during the 4 hours and 45 minutes. The only reason I would ever return would be to give them a bill for the time I wasted there. Obviously, SERVICE is NOT the reason this establishment is still in business."}
{"text":"i should have read the reviews before going back. Downhill, disappointment... not what it used to be. Well, I used to go there quite often. No TV at home, for sporting events, Tilted Kilt was the place to go. Was. No more. Went there as a family, wife, 2 kids. The game is on big screen. Great, exactly what we wanted. So let's order food, and let the kids discover the atmosphere of a game. Loud noise, atmosphere, excitement... Instead of that, management (if it can be called that) declined any sound related to the event. So, help me understand... you are showing something on a big screen, but no sound? The answer from management: there is a baseball game coming up, and we are expecting people. Look around, there is 20 people in the whole bar (sad), 15 are watching the game with no sound. We asked, he declined. No one is here for baseball. Obvious. It makes me wonder, where does Tilted Kilt get people to manage businesses? From Airport Security? Or the poorer intellectually and customer service wise you are, the more you have a chance to manage our multi million dollar facility? In short, that was the very last time I ever stepped foot in a Tilted Kilt, the poverty in management customer service made me forget about the kindness of our server, poor cute thing in the middle. Managing is also leading by example, the example shown by management is that you don't care. So i don't care about your business either. There are plenty other places where I can spend my money. I know, I know,  you don't care..."}
{"text":"Love this place. ,would definitely recommend the Irish stew and Shepherds pie!!  Perfectly seasoned and the beef in the stew was very tender...our waitress was friendly and efficient. ...wish they would open up a restaurant in Houston!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. Beware of prices. We just got back from having dinner and drinks at the kilt and it was absolutely terrible. Things sucked from the start and then it only got worse when our bill came. They overcharged us ($17.99 for a $13.99 meal) and then tried to fight us on the clearly stated prices on the menu. After involving the manager (who as extremely rude and could care less), she revised our bill which she then brought to us and was still wrong!! Then after fighting again we finally got a correct bill. Absolutely outrageous that they would try and charge us more than the menu states. T IS AGAINST THE LAW TO CHARGE MORE THAN YOU ADVERTISE. The manager blamed the difference in price on being from an American system but it doesn't make sense. If the system was american, the prices would be lower. IAnyways I will never be going back to the tilted kilt again. Subpar food and horrible service. Much better options in the area that are local and better to support. I hope this chain dies in Calgary."}
{"text":"We went after the Cubs Dbacks game and were surprised at how fast we were seated. The food is typical bar food, nothing special but our burgers were cooked to order and the wait was 15 minutes which was reasonable for a large crowd. It's a sports bar so we expected it to be loud but the four of us at the table couldn't hear each other. We ordered beers and the server brought the right drinks unfortunately, she gave them to the wrong people all 3 times we ordered. Food and Alcohol prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix for the week, the wife and I stumbled upon the Tilted Kilt in search for some wings.  The first impression was that this radiated a casual, come as you are, stay for a drink or close with the staff depending on how you wanna drink kind of environment.  The staff of mainly scantily clad women were attentive to our needs and brought refills (most important) of alcoholic beverages in a timely manner.  I had ordered the wings (surprisingly good) which were filling. They give you 1 pound.  The garlic fries were the shocker though, perfectly seasoned, prepared and amount good for 2.  I almost finished them without touching the wings.  Great ambiance, good service and good time to be had if you go solo or in a group.  I'll definitely be back if I come back to Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Food is surprisingly good, never had anything I didn't like.  Lots of beer choices and the waitstaff is great...yay."}
{"text":"First time at this location and I have say I wasn't that impressed. Restaurant is 1/4 full if that, and it still took 20 minutes for a medium burger... and I had to wait another 2 minutes for the fries.  The burger and fries were good, but I expected more on my mushroom and swiss burger than mushrooms and swiss cheese... lettuce and tomato maybe. Maybe its my fault for not reading the menu, but $.20 in veggies on the burger doesn't seem like a stretch.  I sat at the bar and Rachel was the bartender. I only know that because it was on the check. For someone in the service industry working lunch with only 6 people at the bar, you would think she would be more engaging. She did the bare minimum that a server is expected I guess. She was attentive in asking if things were ok or if I wanted more to drink. Behind the bar looked pretty clean and Rachel stayed busy with clean and \"stuff\". I hope my experience isnt the standard."}
{"text":"Good place to watch sports on tv. I think they have over 40 tv's. The got a great beer and alcohol selection. Didn't have food here so I can't comment on that at this time. The ambiance is not like your typical Irish pub but still good. Come check this place out."}
{"text":"Atrocious! This word describes the food, service, and ambiance. I saw cockroaches crawling on the floor. God knows if they get on the food or beer!  When there are so many fine places near by, why waste your money here.  Just thinking about this place makes my stomach churn! Just awful."}
{"text":"Went with my dad and brother. We all really liked the girls' costumes. We were pleasantly surprised to see that it's just like a miniature Hooters."}
{"text":"I would give tk zero stars if I could. They put on a party for st pattys day. A complete mess. Extra help walking around doing nothing. No service no food and no drinks. If you have a complaint keep it to yourself. They don't wanna hear it. Table was supposed to be 30 minutes. After an hour of asking and waiting patiently I realized the hostess clearly did not care. And it was not that crowded. I will not be back. No reason to deal with the garbage for sub par food."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We always try to order something different when we go and have never been disappointed. Fantastic drinks and giant screen TVs throughout. Great pub."}
{"text":"Been here many times now. The food is pretty standard burgers and sandwiches. Everything I've had has been really good. The Irish Nachos are always great. The servers are beautiful and have always been helpful and attentive. Rarely has my glass gotten empty before they're asking if I'd like another.   My one complaint would be that they really don't have much for a decent happy hour. Not much for specials on the beer. Appetizer deals are okay though."}
{"text":"Good beers and average female talent level.  Unfortunately, the girls aren't nearly as friendly as other similarly themed places.  The place isn't very clean.  Decent place to grab a beer, shoot the sh$t and head home.  I wouldn't go there to hang out for a game."}
{"text":"First and last time at any tilted kilt establishment. Came to this location for a UFC fight. Came an hour and a half early and had told the waitress/hostess we have a table of 6 coming. 3 of us were present and they continued to move us to a much smaller table and took our chairs we had saved for our on coming guests. Either the waitresses had no experience in dealing with these events or this is how typical tilted kilt establishments are ran. Words of advice, not recommended, go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Myself and some friends were downtown for a concert and stopped in for a couple beers before the show. There were also some NCAA basketball games on as it is March so it was extremely busy. That being said, the establishment was very ill-prepared and the staff was incredibly overwhelmed. Management is to blame for this one and needs to prepare better for busy nights. The bar was four deep on all four sides and there was not an empty seat in the house. I certainly don't mind waiting my turn for a beer, but I definitely don't want to stand there for 15 minutes without even being acknowledged as four different bartenders walk past me at least three times each without even making eye contact. I get busy and it was, I assure you, but come on Tilted Kilt. You are in the service industry and one of the most basic rules of thumb in that industry is to acknowledge people that may have to wait a moment so that they know you see them there and it helps them relax knowing you will be back. To management: wake up and look at a calendar of events and staff appropriately! Your staff was almost doing the best they could...minus the previous statements, but they were truly over run and over whelmed. Your service suffered because of this and there is hardly a better reason to not return to an eating/drinking establishment than bad service. In conclusion...the lengthy wait for a frosty beverage was more irritating than it should have been because it was for a stupid reason. Irritating enough to make me not want to return."}
{"text":"Cold beer and good burgers.  Plenty of TVs for sports viewing. Service is prompt.  The girls are pretty but heavy tattooed."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!!  work close and have clients who also work close to the Tempe location. My self, 3-4 co-workers or 2-3 clients would visit the old location at least 3 times a month. Loved the food, the staff, atmosphere and the noise level. Not to loud but loud enough. We have been to the new location just up the road 3 times since it opened. That's about once a week. All at different times and on different days. The new place stinks!! We have not gotten out of there in under 2 hours yet!! The average is 33 minutes from the time out food is given to the kitchen before it comes to us. Each time the orders are wrong. Drink service is slow and the place is so loud you can't even hear people at your table and that is at lunch time!! The music is ridiculously loud. The managers have offered us 50% discount each time to apologize. What happened to the way things were ran at the old place? It has to be the many of the same staff and kitchen team that works there. We see the many familiar faces. The serving staff tries but the have zero support. Every time we are there, everyone around us at other tables all have issues and the manager visits nearly every table to put out the fires. This place had better get its s*#% together or it's not going to make it. Neither me, my coworkers nor our clients wish to go back there until something changes. It's sad because we would spend hundreds of dollars a month in there but I  guess that's small potatoes these big guys.   Sad - very sad to see how far they have fallen."}
{"text":"Went to watch Monday Night Football.  Food was good, and fair priced.  Beer prices on the other hand were ridiculous, probably cheaper at the actual game.  A pint of domestic was $10, yes domestic!  They told us about a \"deal\" for Bud ($5), so we ordered...the beers were half the size, so their \"special price\" was still $10 for a pint.  I won't go back, other venues right across the courtyard are less than half the price for beer, and let's face it, that's why we go out."}
{"text":"We were seated and our drink order wasn't taken for a good 5 minutes. There were literally 6 girls standing in the front talking, 2 at the bar talk and random girls just pacing back and forth. We get our expensive appetizer and all the sudden there is like a family of flies hovering around our table. I order a ceaser salad and I get this wilted mushy bowl of greens with three croutons. Gross."}
{"text":"Had to check it out after Undercover Bosses lastnight, which I didn't finish.  I din't finish my overpriced meal either and the food is NOT SOOOOO good! \"I\" thought the girls were busting out everywhere although they were friendly, hence the three stars."}
{"text":"Best sports bar in downtown Phoenix. Don't let the Super Bowl weekend reviews fool you, the bar was at Ground Zero of the world that weekend, so of course it was busy.  Great place to visit pre or post game regardless if it's the Suns, D-Backs, Mercury, Rattlers or any other event. You just WALK across the street to the ballpark or basketball stadium.  My favorite dish is are the seafood tacos."}
{"text":"Went with family and friends to watch the Mayweather Canelo fight. They were really flexible with combining and moving tables to accommodate us. There are TV's anywhere so there's not really a 'bad' seat in the house. They will change any TV to whatever channel you like. Food was great. We ordered wings and burgers and someone even ordered ice cream and everyone loved their food.           Service was exceptional. Our server, Shaunte had a section completely filled with families and still managed to get to everyone and get our orders in and she didn't take even a full ten minutes to get our food out to us from the time we ordered it. We were always topped off and never left to ask \"where's our waitress\" which is rare in that busy of an environment."}
{"text":"Went to the Kilt. Only thing this place is good for if you want to watch the girls walk around. The beer service is slow and the food service is terrible. Will let you all know what it taste like"}
{"text":"First time here was after a visit to the casino. You get a free order of \"Irish nachos\" with your first check-in here and they were a disgusting mess. Cheese sauce, ground beef and tomatoes on potato chips. If this is any indication of the rest of their menu, count me out. Yeah it was free, but it was also disgusting.   Lots of young girls with boobs hanging out. The guys wear black shirts and dark kilts to kind of fade into the background. Our server wasn't knowledgeable about their drink selection at all, nor could she explain what a signature drink of theirs was . If you're into staring at young, half-dressed girls while you drink overpriced beer, then this is definitely the place for you!   There are a lot better places in downtown with cheaper drinks, much better food, and probably better girls to stare at!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Sandra is the best ever. Shaunte is a blast. Kaitlyn rocks. Definitely my favorite place to hang out. The entire menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"Most depressing Tilted Kilt I have ever been to. Food sucked, probably won't blow out your afternoon but is not good."}
{"text":"Saturday, 5:30pm. Since this was the first time I'd ever been here, my first impression upon walking in was a pretty decent atmosphere. I liked the huge bar, and as soon as I sat down with 2 friends who were already there, the bartender immediately introduced herself and asked what i wanted. So far, so good.  We were waiting for 5 other people to celebrate a friends birthday and when they showed up, we sat at a table. At this point, it was pretty dead in there. We had our drink a food orders taken fairly quickly by the waitress. By this time, it started to fill up a bit, because they were showing a UFC fight that started at 7pm.  This is where things began to go steadily south. I don't know if their staffing was messed up or what, but our waitress dissappeared for long stretches and getting anyone to take our drink order was impossible. It became so bad that one of my friends actually got up and ordered a drink at the bar because he had an empty beer glass in front of him for over 20 minutes. He was scolded by the pissed off waitress when she finally reappeared.  The straw that broke the camels back, and the main reason why this place gets the big ol' One Star, is because of something that I have never experienced in all of my 37 years. At 8pm, one hour after the fight started, they started charging a $5 cover at the door. No big deal. Lots of places do it. The diffrence here is, the manager and one of the waitresses started going around to EVERY table and to the bar and every patron in the place and started charging a RETROACTIVE COVER CHARGE!! Are you friggin kidding me?!?!  We had been there for 2.5 hours eating and drinking, and they charged us a $5 cover for the priviledge, which came with a wrist band. Seriously? Five bucks isn't a lot of money, but that seems just stupid. Retroactive cover charges? Wow.  Needless to say, I will never go back to this establishment simply on principle. If this is how they treat their customers, they must have a tough time getting repeat business. Management, if you read this, you need to get your shit together and abolish that. Charging a cover at the door at 8pm for new folks arriving specifiaclly to suck down some water and watch the fight? Understood. Charging a party of 8 the same after we had been there for over 2 hours running up over a $250 bill, as well as all the other folks who were in there too? Thats just bad business practice."}
{"text":"Very pleased with our first visit to TK. We recently tried Twin Peaks and we hated the atmosphere and the décor. TK was a big improvement, and the service was better also.  Food: excellent... menu was larger than we expected. There were several vegetarian options including a black bean wrap which was delicious. Pizza was also great.  My friend tried the beer recommended by the waitress and he was happy with the featured selection.  When we are in the mood for attractive servers in skimpy outfits, we will definitely come here from now on.  Twin Peaks offered no veg-friendly entrees, but TK really delivered on the food.  We also liked the Pub theme, and the clientele was mellow."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you are downtown Cleveland and you love to watch all types of sports, drink beer (great selection to choose from), and enjoy the company of beautiful young ladies in kilts! Oh yeah, the food is pretty good too. Don't go here if you are expecting a quiet evening out with the wife.   My friends and I love going here for some pub grub style food and throwing back a few cold ones. The waitresses are super friendly and really cute!   I would go back and I would recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was on point and the service was outstanding, thanks for the great hospitality!!!"}
{"text":"What can you say about this place? I was in the area, in the middle of the day, and thirsty. I had never heard of the Tilted Kilt before, so I thought - an Irish pub!! All right!! I went in - and things were looking great - nice interior, lots of big screen TV's, and good looking waitresses (I'm a guy - I like looking at good looking scantily clad women).  But it went downhill fast. I wandered over to the bar, sat down, and waited. Did I mention I was thirsty?  It took a good 5 minutes for the bartender to even notice I was there - she was busy talking to other customers on the outside bar.  She finally noticed me, and handed me a menu and took my drink order. Never said a word!!  She then went back to her conversation with the others.   While she was socializing, I did look at the menu, and the food people were eating, and nothing really looked or sounded appetizing. Twenty minutes later, she came back, and sharply asked me if I wanted to order. By that time, I just wanted another beer before I left. She grumpily took the menu, and went back to talking to the guys on the outside bar.  I did notice that out of about 20 people in the restaurant, all were men.  Obviously, they were there to look at the waitresses, and not for the service or food. But all were sitting at the bar or outside patio - maybe the secret is to sit at a table.  BTW - the bartender never came back.  She was so engrossed in her conversation on the other side of the bar, I could have walked out without paying and she never would have noticed.  I did leave cash for the drinks - but no tip.    So if you want to dine and dash - this might be the place. But otherwise, don't bother."}
{"text":"Never really ordered anything but the appetizers which are pretty good and for reasonable prices. The margaritas are delicious! Our server, Sam, had everything out efficiently. She also continued to check on us throughout our time here and make sure we were doing good. I'll definitely be coming back and requesting her."}
{"text":"I think this place was ridiculously overstaffed since ALL of the servers were sitting at a table engaging in conversation for most of the time I was there.  The table closest to the entry way needed bused the ENTIRE time I was there.  The servers made me feel as if I was inconveniencing them and seldom came back to check to see if I needed anything else. One of the rare-old-times I left less than a 10% tip.  In my opinion, you only get one shot in Vegas as a restaurant and these guys blew it.  I was too liberal with two stars but the food was decent."}
{"text":"This bar is near my work so we went there for a going away (dude got fired!) party.  It was a good time, our server(s) were both pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this location. We were invited to come here for the Women's World Cup, ready for a great time and a rowdy crowd!! We were served promptly when we walked in, however, the service slowly declined. After the first round of drinks, we sat here for about 20 minutes without refills or acknowledgement by servers and management. We were told there was a server switch and would be expected to get service soon. We had to grab a manager to get it all sorted out. Once we started getting served again, by Celeste, who was amazing, it wasn't a problem. But then as we were getting our checks, there was a problem. We were told the \"Hoppy Hour\" would give us better drink specials than our checks showed. We grabbed a manager and was given the \"we can do anything we can to solve this problem\". The problem was $4 taken off our $40 tabs. The service we received here was unexpected and unwelcome. Maybe next time it will be better"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. The waitress, I think her name was Kayla, told us she was new and had only been there 2 weeks. I'm not sure if it was lack of training or maybe this is her first job, but she isn't good at it. I might be wrong, but when you have tables I suspect you should pay attention to them instead of sitting in the back where your customers can see you and fuck with your phone for 15 minutes. I'm going to assume that she didn't notice that our drinks only had ice in them when she brought out the food. Maybe they don't do refills here anymore since when we asked she didn't bring them. Once 2 glasses had meted ice and 2 were empty, she asked us if we wanted refills, which we all replied with a yes please. Guess what she brought back instead of refills? If you guessed more drinks, you are wrong, she brought our bills. While handing out the checks, we once again inquired about our beverages, which she said they're coming. They didn't. She came to collect the checks instead. Trying to survive on wearing a Tilted Kilt uniform alone isn't enough, you actually have to serve your customers."}
{"text":"Downgrading my review after my last visit.  I wanted my family to experience the great food and service I had previous times. Went in the evening this time, discovered the special was 1/2 price apps, so we decided to do appetizers only.  We ordered 4 appetizers for the three of us. EVERY appetizer was horrible.  I had to get up and get napkins and silverware.  Nachos barely had any toppings. Potato skins were cold. Spinach dip was just bad.   Very disappointed this time."}
{"text":"We came in on a Friday night, party of 6.  The hostess asked if is was ok if we sat at a flat top...sure no problem  We were ushered to the back of the restaurant, underneath a huge tv screen,  from previous reviews...I think this might be the new Black Hole.    We sat and waited....and waited....one of our party waved down a busboy , while I flagged down a waitress for some assistance.  Mind you there were at least 3 waitresses standing around talking in one of the stations close to us.  In all, we probably waited 10 minutes, NO ONE ever came to wait on us.  We all got up & left.  Walked across the road & promptly spent over $250.00 at another establishment."}
{"text":"Went there a couple days for first time. The place is more like a sports bar with hooters-like waitresses. Just got a couple of Guinness and a dessert while watching NBA playoffs. Service was OK, though took sometime before seeing the waitress to put my order. Food was OK, but I'll go back to try 1-2 entrees. Overall, just another sports bar, little to do with Irish (BTW: kilts are from Scotland)"}
{"text":"OK, so I get that the tilted kilt is basically the Irish version of hooters. I kind of feel bad for the girls in their scantly clad uniforms, but hey, they chose to work there so don't complain when guys ogle at you.   Boyfriend and I had some friends in the the Yukon, and it was cold, and that was the closest place to go besides the rose and crown.   It was packed as it was the beginning of our sadly shortened hokey season. We found a table that wasn't cleared off yet but took it anyway as it was the only one that was able to seat the 4 of us. The servers walked back and forth and didn't even acknowledge that we were there. 30 MINUTES later I finally got up and went to get a server to tell her that our table needed to be cleared and we were waiting to order.  ... i got a giggle, head bob and a smile and a \"just a moment please\", basically she told me where to go but the polite girl version.   Then a new server came over and cleared the table, then another new server came over and got our drink orders and ANOTHER server came to get our food orders. All of us at the table work in the restaurant industry and were very disappointed by the food.. sadly i don't quite remember what we had because we ended up drinking a lot that night.. After we got our drinks, or server seemed to be there all the time. So its either you get no attention or to much attention. We had a couple more drinks and decided to go somewhere else.   I may go back when there's no game on and it isn't so intensely busy, see if that makes a difference."}
{"text":"My \"dining\" experience at the Tilted Kilt began around 9:30 pm on 7/3/2012.  I can start by saying that I had an idea of what I was getting myself into before I arrived: Scantily clad servers and bar food (think dressed like the O'Henry candy bar girl from Seinfeld).  The disinterested hostess sat my friend and I at a four-top street side looking out toward the Horseshoe.  Although it was a raining, the open window seating was quite enjoyable.  Our even less than interested server started us off by telling us about her long day and how she had to work a double shift on 7/4.  My friend ordered a beer and I stuck with an iced tea (I was the designated driver).  After 15 minutes she returned with our drinks and asked if we were ready to order.  I asked if she had any suggestions.  She responded with the standard \"everything here is good\" line.  I figured because she worked so much she must know what is good to eat right?  We started off with the potato skins and I ordered the Gaelic chicken.  After an hour and a half (the restaurant was not busy) and our waitress stopping by to inform us that she wanted to leave and we were her last table, all of our food arrived.  The potato skins were average at best - something I could pickup in the frozen food area at Giant Eagle, maybe even Walgreen's.  The chicken, well lets say that Cargill Salt better work some overtime this summer.  There was more salt in that chicken than I could have imagined.  I thought about sending it back, but fear of another hour and a half wait stopped me.  I consumed what I could and before we could finish, our waitress stopped by to tell us that she was going home and that we needed to close out.  We closed out our check and I thought, how bad could dessert be?  Well after waiting almost an hour for our \"new\" server, I asked for a dessert menu.  Fifteen minutes later she handed over a dessert menu and I ordered the cheesecake.  Forty-five minutes passed and she returned with a less than Sara Lee quality cheesecake that I consumed about half of.    With our almost three hour meal coming to an end, I decided enough was enough and I obtained the check for my \"tasty\" cheesecake and my friend's drink.  After I provided the waitress with my credit card, I watched her go over to another table, sit down, and engage in a twenty-minute conversation with that table before she rang out my tab.  If the Tilted Kilt were a normal sports bar/eatery, zero stars.  However, I am a guy and the eye candy gives it a one star rating.  With that in mind, I will not be suggesting the Tilted Kilt on my next trip downtown."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food, not-so-surprisingly bad service.  I ate lunch here a week ago, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. I ordered a chicken tender wrap with buffalo sauce, and fries on the side. The sauce was good and the fries were nicely seasoned, the menu has plenty of pub fare to choose from, and the prices are reasonable. I can't speak to the beer selection since I was there for a business lunch.  The service, however, was miserable. I walked in with another person at 12:15 which, although it's peak lunch time, the place was not very crowded. We were seated right away, but after 15 minutes of no one coming over to our table, we had to go back to the hostess stand to ask that a waitress be sent over. After 5 more minutes of waiting, we finally had a waitress and we gave her our order. Over the next 35 minutes, our waitress had zero interaction with us whatsoever, despite the fact that both of our drinks were empty within 5-10 minutes of placing our order.  We finally were able to flag down our waitress, and as it turns out, she never actually put in our food order. The manager eventually came over and apologized, and also picked up the tab, which was nice. As I said before, the food was good, but it was too much of a hassle and there are too many other options nearby, so I don't anticipate returning to this restaurant.  I think part of the reason that the service was so bad is because the waitresses here are taught to do so many other things than just be a server... they have to sit down and mingle with their tables, ask a certain number of questions, be flirty, etc. It's part of the business model, and I get that, but it's no excuse for terrible service."}
{"text":"It's like the food and service quality of Fat Fish Blue came back to haunt The Tilted Kilt. Food is awful. Drinks are 95% mixer and 5% liquor. If you think Sam Adams is a micro brew than you will be impressed with the craft beer selection.  Go to Ontario St. cafe or the casino. If you aren't constrained to the block around the casino check out some of the independently owned restaurants you will be a lot happier."}
{"text":"We come here when we can to watch football.  We live by the other Titled Kilt on Catus but they are not nice over there. We love this Kilted Kilt everyone is really nice and the food is great. The obe on Bell Road is the best one."}
{"text":"All in all, a great place to go with your friends. Not exactly a family place, but that's ok. Locations all over. Went here on my birthday (today) great service, got sung to, free dessert, great food, beautiful young girls who are fun to talk to and actually will have a conversation with you. 4/5 stars. I love this place. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Walked in and got kicked out for no reason. Ordered food and was chatting with friends. Nobody was drunk we just wanted food and a drink. Was it because most of the group was Hispanic ??  I'll never go back. So rude!!"}
{"text":"Don't bother. The three draft beers our group tried were tasteless, even after we specified we prefer hoppy brews. The Irish Stew, a signature dish, had the consistency of chili, rather than having recognizable chunks of meat and vegetables, and was overly salty. Decor is passably pub-like."}
{"text":"Chelsea is the best bartender she took care of me and my stomach lol i try to come and get food and drinks here once or twice a month ill always come back"}
{"text":"Went to the tilted kilt on Thursday afternoon, service wasn't great, waited 12 minutes to get our beers and the place was empty, didn't  even want to dare order food..could be here all day,our server was chatting it up with someone sitting at the bar not doin her job when she should have,  don't worry I'm letting people know, people always ask me how bars on 17ave are this bar is a failing grade will I be back? ,no.gotta get your shit together and hire some good waitresses who know how to work in the bar/pub industry."}
{"text":"Best not to eat here. The food is mediocre and 90% of the scantily clad servers don't exactly seem like the sharpest knives in the drawer and usually mess up your order, forget to bring you cutlery, or take forever to bring your order because they're too busy doing 'selfies' with drooling male patrons. This is not a pub - it's just a cheap bar were desperate men can drink beer and ogle the women servers. It's kinda sad, really. As a woman patron, one doesn't feel comfortable coming here because the majority of clientele are male. I can't understand why a restaurant would cater exclusively to only half the population. Not a great business model.  Whatever you do, don't order a salad. After it's prepared, the cook will put it under the hot lights with other meals that need warming before pickup. This kind of stupid, unthinking practice makes for a rather disgusting, completely wilted salad."}
{"text":"Made a reservation on Yelp. Got to the restaurant and they saw the Yelp reservation on their screen but refused to honor it. The girl at the desk was quite rude. They were very busy and clearly can do without my business."}
{"text":"I met my cousin Tony downtown for some drinks and food after a hard day at work.  We started at the Butcher and Brewer but after watching cooking shows on 3 of the 5 TVs we decided that we needed to see some sports because Tony had some action on a college game.  Some goombats on the street said we could should check out the kilt because they have a bunch of TVs. I was worried at first because I thought he meant guys dressed up as chicks and he wasn't too far off.    The place did have TVs, but it smells like Old Municipal after the Tribe got swept by the Rangers back in '82 on a hot August night.  The bathrooms  look like a keg room from a college frat party, water all over the floor, but, at the same time someone may have gotten greasy there just four minutes before.   The bartender looked like she hated her life and realized she was working at a second rate Hooters in Cleveland on a shitty January night.  She managed to charge me five dollars for a Budweiser bottle, or assumed I was tipping her like she was a strip club bartender.    The night did get brighter when I thought I caught a working girl across the bar, but 10 minutes later her girlfriend showed up and just my luck she turned out to be a lesbian.  Before leaving I asked the angry faced bartender about the place around the corner and she said it was too dark there for a guinea like me.  The next time I want to watch sports downtown I'm just gonna go to the casino and try not to get the measles from that dirty crowd but it would be cheaper, a lot cleaner, and maybe there I'd find a hooker."}
{"text":"Ick! Staff service was very good and that's about the only positive thing to say about this place.  Food is pretty horrible. Don't order the corned beef unless you want thin, flavorless, fatty meat severed with a side of mushy, greasy vegetables. The tables are gross, looks like they haven't been cleaned in days and not sure why the waitresses don't wipe them down before serving customers. Really icky.  Sure this is a decent place to grab a beer, but not if you want to eat, talk and enjoy.  Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way home from work and had the best chicken wings ever.  The Tilted sauce is the best.  Not too hot, with a little bbq flavor too.  Great selection of craft beers.  I'll be back for some NFL games."}
{"text":"Slow service. Food is average, looks and tastes pre packaged. They have a good setting here, just need to get it together with service. I'm sure the food quality would seem better as well with less time to stare at it."}
{"text":"March madness....Tilted Kilt madness! The good: Close place by the US Airways stadium with cheap BEER...The Bad: Slow service, small cold pizza, semi cold beer and girls looked tired...need to smile more! Not like I care but if you plan to be understaffed on a big night of game events....make it work!"}
{"text":"Ok stopped in Tilted Kilt in the west valley (Peoria), for lunch. Walked into a great atmosphere sat at the bar, then had the bartender come around shake my hand and introduce herself. *If you sit at the bar ask for Malaya* I sat down and ordered a Devil's Ale from one of my favorite craft brewies; San Tan Brewery. I looked at both their menu and the yelp suggestions on what to try, and sure enough I got a free order of irish nachos ($9.00 value) with my check in on yelp. The Barbeque cheesebuger was awesome, I made it dissapear fast but don't be surprised if you end up asking for a box to go. Best part overall 6 dollar 20 ounce beers, hey that's a great price for a draft beer!  *All my felllow veterans/active/reserve/guard folks, Tilted Kilt will give you HALF off your entire bill mondays betweeen 1100-1500!*"}
{"text":"Food was decent, drink was yummy....service could've been a little better, but for a sports bar, it is overall okay."}
{"text":"Normally, people do not bother reading the reviews for a franchise shop as they expect a consistent level of service among them.  But, Tilted Kilt in Esplanade made me believe that this is not correct.  BE PREPARED TO WAIT FOR AT LEAST ONE HOUR FOR YOUR FOOD: We went there on a Friday for lunch where there were only 8-10 people siting around with a drink. We ordered the drink and 2 immediately ordered the food as well. 40 minutes later, I asked the waitress about the food and she said our food is ready and just about to be served. 15 minutes later, I asked her again and she said sorry we have only one chef and he is working hard to catch up with the orders. 10 Minutes later, I asked for the bill and guess what, instead of offering us a drink on the house or free food, they said OK here is your bill.  I WILL NEVER EVER GO TO THIS PLACE AGAIN.  Too bad I did not read the reviews before going to this place as it appears that this is their consistent practice."}
{"text":"Food took forever to come, food was cold and didn't taste good at all. Going to any place other than this would be a good idea. Don't waste your money like we did, please."}
{"text":"I really like this place and want to give it a good review but I can't. We've been going the last few weeks for the FB games. The service has been the sole reason for the bad review. I love the setting and food. The mozzarella sticks are great. The Irish(French) dip sandwich is amaze balls. Best sandwich I've had in a long time. I seriously wanted to order 2. And then the boneless wings were some of the best. I order wings everywhere and tilted kilts are the best. I loved everything there...except the service killed everything. Our server gave us out first drinks, then never came back. 40 min later I had to go to the manager and ask for a new server. I saw her walking around, she just never came back to take our order or give us new drinks. The new server was then awesome. Always there. Very accommodating. Gave her a $25 tip. But the first server was horrible. Not the first time it happened either. Another time we were seated but then the server never even came by at all. Finally had to flag down a random waitress to get service. The food and atmosphere is great...5 stars. Service is so bad it actually needs to be addressed and limits their stars to 2."}
{"text":"The tilted kilt is the place to be when in Vegas! They have games, great food, and a super friendly attentive staff. Lauren the hostess went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed, as did her manger Desi! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to grab a beer and a bite to eat before heading over to a comedy show. Sat down at the bar, greeted 5 minutes later and ordered a beer. We asked for menus to see what we wanted and that's the last of us getting any attention. We sat there for over a half an hour watching the bartenders just chat with themselves and dance for the manager right in the corner next 2 us and finally we had enough. We asked for the bill and thanked them for never coming back to check in on us at which the bartender said \"oh sorry\" with an attitude. We spoke to the manager when we left to let him know what a disappointing experience we had. He offered to get someone who could take our order and would even comp us but that was not why we wanted to talk to him, it was more about him knowing what type of service was being given in his restaurant. We stay at the Hotel Palomar right next door many times a year and will take our business to the other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Went to Titled kilt for a drink for a drink or two.  Long story short, felt neglected by the bartender."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Should have read the reviews before we came here.  A friend wanted to try it.  Teakwoods down the street is 100% better.  Service here is too slow for ordinary bar food.  Not to mention $5.50 for flat draft Bud Light.  If you can mess up Bud Light you could screw up a one car funeral!"}
{"text":"Our party of four all enjoyed their meals (ribs, wings, and a French dip). Even the sides were amazing (cole slaw, mashed potatoes, fries, and mac and cheese). Everything was reasonably priced, especially for being on the strip. Would come again!"}
{"text":"While it's difficult for me to give a place that serves Dead Guy Ale and cider on tap one star, the \"pint\" glass issue bothers me, as an honest and seasoned drinker. American pints are supposed to hold 16 ounces of delicious liquid happiness, but Tilted Kilt's thick-walled, thick-bottomed glasses only seem to hold 12 ounces (I also tested this with a 12-ounce bottle). I just don't see this place as having to cut corners like that, given its popularity.  Not to mention the fact that it's a bit shameful for an Irish/English themed bar to not serve Imperial pints, in my opinion.  Aside from that fact, it seems to be a decent place to watch games, ogle scantily clad waitresses, be cheated out of 4 ounces, or do other quite manly stuff that manly men do in sports bars. The food is also largely forgettable, but adequate for sports bar food."}
{"text":"Went in kinda early on a Saturday for  lunch.food was good I had a huge grilled chicken sandwich and onion rings.all was good..staff was very polite and cool people.I cant lie them girls in the kilts are.beutifull :-)"}
{"text":"Can I put zero stars. At this point it took us 20 minutes after getting seated to get a waitress to stop at the table. Then given a poor excuse about why. Don't know if the food is any good at this time but the beer selection looks good."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes at the bar for an overpriced beer. The bar wasn't even busy. My friend was waving his empty cup in the air and the bartender passed him three times before we just gave up and left. Seemed like if you weren't a regular they just totally ignored you. Ridiculous, will not go back."}
{"text":"While the food was good and tv's all over the service was lousy and you had to look for a server"}
{"text":"If you don't care that your money is buying really plain and boring food, and want to drown in jiggly tits, this is the place for you.  Our main reason for going here was that every other place on the North Shore had long waits and although we could have traveled to another nearby area, we figured that the food had to be at least something worthwhile given this was a sit down restaurant with a full menu. Some would say that a short wait for a table would warrant a good rating, but since every other place had a huge wait, that is really not a good aspect by comparison. It's kinda like saying \"Wow you're so luck you don't have to listen to Katy Perry sing!\" to a deaf person.  The food was really bland, boring and nothing special. Boring food is OK if you're not paying a lot at a drive thru or you make it at home with no culinary skills, but a sit down restaurant should actually have something to it for taste. As for drinks, two of the four of us had alcohol. My sister-in-law's Long Island was injected with more liquor than Billy Joel on a drive home. My \"Lynchburg Lemonade\" tasted like nothing. It was almost just a flat soda, though I'd be willing to wager that I could drink actual flat soda and get more wasted.  While our server was nice, she was barely existent (I believe most of them hang out with the bartenders and forget they have tables . . . and possibly standards). I had an easier time believing Denise Richards as a Nuclear Physicist in that Bond movie than I did believing that the women here were waitresses.  If the food had some substance and quality to it, I don't think this would be a horrible place to go. I just don't see spending the money on bland food and drinks. Since I have to give it at least one star, I'd justify it with the fact that they do make the male workers wear kilts (so kudos on consistency for them) and because we had fun making lots of \"Tilted Klit\" jokes."}
{"text":"Worse resteraunt I have been to.took forever to get food wings was frozen on inside and burnt on outside.the wings was black they was so burnt but was still frozen and slimy inside took half hour to get refills on drinks asked to see Manager three times and wouldn't even come out.felt like I was eating at a strip club rather than a restaurant and pub.extremely disappointed .will never go back or recommend to anyone.the place was not busy so no excuses on way it was ran except for bad management and bad staff."}
{"text":"The waitress was outstanding! All the women are drop dead gorgeous!! Service was fast and very professional. Highly recommend everyone to come will be back again."}
{"text":"Great service. Definitely check this place out! Location is perfect, right in the middle of the strip, next to The High Roller! The whole ambiance of The Linq is puts off a perfect roam outdoor dining district, sporting numerous bars, restaurants, and shopping. Located right on the middle of the strip, with one of Las Vegas biggest attractions, The worlds tallest observation wheel, the tilted kilts overall is a must visit. Great food, service, numerous TV's showing sports, and a great outdoor view. Ashley our server was great, extremely friendly, building relationships with us as we dined. Thank you Ashley so much!!!!  All the staff was always friendly, smiling and greeting us. As a casino industry executive I can honestly say that The Tilted Kilt offers friendly service, great food, and a perfect strip location."}
{"text":"Went there last Sunday - crowded but not packed. There were enough people for good energy but a few tables left.    I'd say it was a very good vibe. New in town and met some cool people, even got to  heckle a lone cowboy fan when they lost which, next to the cards winning was the highlight of my day..  Waitress was very nice and fast. Overall I'd say it's  a good place."}
{"text":"Let me preface this with the statement that I eat out in a restaurant for most of my meals.  I grew up in the restaurant business and understand good service, good management and customer expectations.  I also rarely tip less than 20% on a bill.  Last night was a rare exception; the only time this year; less than 0.5% of all of my dining experiences in 2014.    The Tilted Kilt is a chain breastaurant with good food, a good beer selection, and typically, very attentive waitresses.  Last night was not typical of the ones I have dined at in the past.  My coworkers and I went there to watch football, eat and have a few drinks. For some reason, our waitress was determined to flip our table as quickly as possible after the first 90 minutes.  We were enjoying apps, dinners and drinks beginning around 7pm.  Our tab would have been higher, but after our food was served, she began clearing our table.  After the final plate was taken, she even took our DD's half-full glass of water.  I guess they needed the glasses or something, LOL.  From there, I guess she felt her duties were over.  We were actually going to order Hoppy Hour apps that begin at 9pm, but she never returned.  My coworkers and I had an empty glass for 30 minutes and at 9:40 we tried to flag her down, call her and wave as she attended two other tables.  At 9:45 she was close enough to toss a coaster to get her attention.  Apparently, light-hearted hijinks are frowned upon in that establishment.  On the fourth toss, she finally realized we were trying to hail her and.  Their marketing manager came over to investigate.  When we explained that we had been waiting for 45 minutes, I tried to excuse her absence to the newness of the restaurant.  She didn't take this as a subtle \"out\" to continue our dining experience.  She said that there was blame on both the waitress and us.  After asking if it was acceptable for us to wait for 45 minutes for a fly-by, my frustrations were overwhelming and we cancelled our drink order and asked for the bill.  The manager finally came over with the bill and asked us to leave, threatening to call the cops for assaulting a waitress.  I had to look up assault this morning to assure that I didn't miss anything in a reasonable person's interpretation of that definition (I didn't).  He turned and walked away before we could hand him the bill, so we were held hostage for another two trips while he shagged the credit card machine and a pen.  Emboldened, he repeated his request for us to leave.    I hope that the manager and his manager do triage on how they lost customers, tips for the waitress (we were kind enough to leave 10%) and sales due to an inattentive waitress and how fun and frivolity are part of why we go to a bar."}
{"text":"Somebody thought it was a good idea to put men in skirts behind the bar yea  This is nothing like Twin Peaks you know good looking girls serving drinks no  Haha for real it's two dudes behind the bar  Yea there are waitresses that are pretty but this IS NOT TWIN PEAKs"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to take the family and watch a game. All of the staff are friendly and the food is served fast even on busy days. My favorite item is Mother Clucker chicken sandwich! Great name and tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Come at 9pm Friday night for a live acoustic performance! My friends and I always meet up there every Fridays"}
{"text":"Prepare to pay 10 dollah for parking across the street, unless you happen to be parked elsewhere for a concert or game.  Not for the the girlfriends/wives dressed to kill in matching sexy stilletoe heels, because prepare to hobble.     Food is usual bar and grill food.  Ambiance is standard double jumbo tron projection TVs and multiple smaller flat screens blaring the game of the day.     Svc. is standard.  Good for the creepy old midlife crisis men who ogle young twenty somethings dressed in mini skirt kilts and unbuttoned tight shirts.     Food is rather decent if you send back your food to the kitchen to have it reheated or re-done.  That usually gets the management's attention to make it right and bring it back faster, otherwise prepare to wait.  and wait.  but for the average customer here just to watch a game, one barely notices.  I never did receive my order of \"famous\" galric fries, because they forgot to bring my order, and the steamed clams they brought out were icy cold and shriveled to tiny black nubbins.  When I asked them to taste for themselves, they made a face and quickly brought out a brand new batch which were plump and tasty.   Then why did it take 45 minutes for me to get my first order? I didn't even get any alcohol drink.    It's one of those novelty- themed sports bars where a guy goes for standard brew and some mediocre chow to fill some kind of psychological void while watching a game.     Not a romantic date place, for sure, and not so much fun for the family with kids, either, unless one takes a bunch of boys here to celebrate their bar mitzvahs.   I went because my Love so desperately wanted to see Sunday football someplace different than Zipps, while I desperately wanted to have gourmet food and go shopping at a mall.     Might as well drop your man off at this sports bar which can serve as a sort of day care center, while the ladies make a run to the mall, otherwise, one is better off to go the local sports bar (unless you want to shell out extra mulah) for standard food and TV fare."}
{"text":"Its st paddys day and your a irish bar....you would think you guys would plan accordingly....our server never came by w waited 20 mins vefore we flagged downa server to get our drink order....another 20 minites later we finally got our 1 beer and jamson drink....then nobody came around to take our food order so we left....charge 10$ cover charge for what the bad service??? I saw a older cpuple also having food issues while we were there...the girls rather walk around with buckets trying to sell crap than serve.....please take down the mariners and seaawks stiff down a disgrace to seahawk fans!!!!!last year it was better organized and run than this year"}
{"text":"Gaelic Chicken! Love love love it. Every time I order it it's made different, sometime with pasta, sometimes mashed potatoes but always to die for. Kids live it too. Never ate in. Did I tell you we love the Garlic Chicken :-)"}
{"text":"I walked out. Waitress did not know anything about menu or bar and would not be bothered with learning."}
{"text":"Fun sports bar with faux Irish theme and guys in kilts...  Varied selection of beers (the national ones of course) but also local AZ brews as Four Peaks, Oak Creek and Mother Road. Some European brand as Guinness, Newcastle, Heineken and Stella."}
{"text":"We just saw a great show by the wonderful Dave Chappelle? and decided to stay downtown and grub somewhere familiar.   The food and beer were good, but the service was absolutely horrible.   We waited forever for everything.   We were never asked for drink refills or if our food was ok?  We had to hunt the waitress down to meet any requests and to finally get our bill.  It was like she was avoiding us like the plague.  Our food order was also mixed up and took 20 mins and was not offered to be taken off.  Ridiculous!!  I will not return!!! Ever!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on the St. Patrick's Day parade. They had a grill set up outside and the side of chips were just chilling in a  garbage can. No bag or anything. Outside of the can looked gross so don't think the inside was all that clean. They noticed us looking and threw a lid over it. So, if you are looking for a place to serve you garbage, this is the place"}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if i could the service we received the worst service ever. Ive been to plenty of kilts and normally have a great time, not this time. She was blonde, pale, and went by the name of Carrie. She was very rude and made it seem like we weren't worth her time. SORRY, I WAS GOING TO TIP YOU. Try harder next time sweetie."}
{"text":"Would've given ZERO stars if i could. I've come here multiple times only to see the servers on their phones and \"gossiping\" about the work place. Girls need to work on their game."}
{"text":"Quickly seated though boneless wings were less than par in quantity and taste. Chopped side salad had deli turkey slices which was disappointing for me. I won't order it again or be back in the near future. Friend had \"ok' patty melt. Too much competition out there for this quality of food."}
{"text":"Ok.  Here is the deal with this place..... it's like Hooters.  Mediocre food and girls willing to wear more \"revealing\" attire to satisfy your eyeballs while you eat, drink, and be merry watching your favorite sports teams duke it out.  Went here on my 21st birthday for lunch.  It was a good time for sure.  Check it out if you have already been to a Hooters.  Wouldn't recommend going here more than twice a year."}
{"text":"Table was dirty on arrival,  never got our appetizer,  delivered wrong food twice to our table.    Food had hair in it when they final brought the correct plate.(Saddies stuffed chicken breast) My ribs weredry looked like they had been sitting they're for awhile.  We won't go back. The only good thing they kept our drinks coming."}
{"text":"Angela is simply amazing!!  We visit every Friday during lunch and she never leaves us wanting more except to keep coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that as far as the girls go they were for the most part nice and welcoming without being to familiar.   My issue is with the food which is Denny's quality but with strip prices.   The wait time for said Denny's quality grub (nothing against Denny's btw), which was close to 45mins.  Maybe I wasn't paying close attention to my tab but I have been at far more established places and don't remember paying as much for drinks, again very costly.   Bar staff were uninterested, maybe I wasn't attractive enough for them which I gathered was the motivation of interest for them given the pattern of service they provided.  I happen to think I'm a solid 6.5 ;)   I enjoy trying new places and experiencing the best Vegas has to offer.   Happily though I won't be returning to this place.  It made me sad to see some of the nice girls with so much personality waste there talents in this establishment.   I would say I wish tilted kilt all the best in the future but that would be a lie.  Save your pennies people and treat your man, your woman or your buddy to a place more deserving of your quality time."}
{"text":"Awesome place for seahawks fans in enemy territory. Friendly servers and bartender, attentive and courteous.  Great seating area and huge wide bar.  Seahawks booster club and friendly for visitors.  Good variety of beer, drinks and food. Quick service on all.  Small but yummy dessert menu.  Great place with lots of tvs to watch games, a bit loud during college games for conversations at the bar but likely quieter in the dining area and further from big screens."}
{"text":"Was in town on business and acted as an evening bar fly at this location.  Sharon was rockin' the bar area and dealing with patrons that were less than preferred. Food was good, love an affordable Happy Hour menu when I'm not looking to gorge on food.  Beer selection was decent, only a couple of IPA's but Goose Island and Lagunitas are always reliable."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked inside and waited to be seated, after a few minutes of standing around a waitress finally made eye contact and told us to seat ourselves. We sat ourselves near other customers and waited for 15+ minutes as waiters and waitresses walked by never once stopping to offer us menus or drinks. The music was very loud and after being ignored we got up and left. Very poor service. I would give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Stopped into the Tilted Kilt to watch some college games and kill some time after dropping off the kids for Scarowinds. This was my first visit here so I didn't have any expectations. There were a large selection of beers on tap and plenty of TV's.  You didn't have to look far to catch a game that was of interest.  Saturday night had a pretty decent crowd. Ordered the wing special and it came out before I had gotten through the first draft.  Love the chunky blue cheese.  Wings were good and the waitress was engaging and attentive without hovering.  The managing partner was kind enough to stop by and ask how everything was and if I needed anything, even offered to change one of the TV's to any game I wanted to watch.  Overall it was a good experience and I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here for Happy Hour. Great drink specials and the appetizers are delicious, especially the chicken quesadilla! The servers are super friendly (even to a guy that is sitting with his wife) and they are always making sure you are being taken care of. Plenty of TV's for watching the games and very easy to strike up a conversation with whomever is sitting around you. Just a cool friendly place all around. We have been to a few other local pubs but this is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"A bit less than average.  I travel a lot and eat out a lot.  Whatever they are trying to do here is just not working.  I would be surprised if this place survives.  Food was barely average at best.  Service was just OK.  Waitress came by maybe twice to see if I needed anything.  Wasn't unfriendly but not especially friendly either.  Just ok.  Everything about this place can be described that way.  Just ok.  Not fun in any way.  Beer selection not great but ok.  Waitresses seems to prefer standing around the hostess station chatting among themselves than waiting on their customers.  One waitress, not mine, spent 90% of her time chatting up one young man sitting at a little middle bar.  Don't know if it was her boyfriend or what but she would make mad dashes to quickly check on her other customers maybe once or twice and rush back to him.  Eat off his plate, etc.  Not very professional.  Seemed that it bothered her to have to go and check on her other customers.  It wasn't one of those places that when I left, I was thinking that was nice, have to come back here.  Not likely that I ever will."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times to either watch the games or just grab a pint after work. I haven't ordered much off the menu, but from what I've had its always been good.   From my limited experience I've always had great and fast service. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I have been to two other TK's (Scottsdale and Tempe) and had a better experience at both. First off the soda mix was messed up. Now I can get over this because that is the way these things work. You usually have little to no warning when the mix goes bad but it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to get me a new drink. The sandwich was not good either...the French/ Irish dip was totally bland. The au jus had a little flavor which helped me choke it down but I'd never order it again. Our waitress was nice even though she was completely overwhelmed but a couple of the other servers looked downright pissed off and mean.   This establishment will probably be very profitable because of its location within CityScape. The alcohol sales alone will probably be enough to keep it in the black. If I ever go back it will be for adult beverages only. I'd rather get a hot dog at Chase or US Airways.  At least the boobies are fun to look at."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Erin the bartender rocks!!! If ure not satisfied got to knicks or flannerys where there charge u 20% without ur approve"}
{"text":"This place made me not happy as there were regular guys you could tell that the waitresses were coming on to or seeing and ignoring the other customers the couple times I was in there"}
{"text":"American chain. Similar to Hooters, but done right. 40+ beers on tap, including Delirium Tremens. A nice panel of tvs on one end, with enough throughout to cover what you need. Food is chain style. Won't get something incredible, but also won't get something terrible that you won't finish. Going to be great for groups watching sports or out drinking ... but leave the wives at home. Happy Hour menu looks like it'll be good as well.  Jan 12: Raptors, Leafs and College Football Championship on tv and it's dead, with two guys and two girls working. It's a Monday though. Holding out some hope on this place."}
{"text":"This place has absolutely awful service. We ate lunch on a Thursday and the service was super slow. Took over 20 minutes to get drinks. Food was awful. Had a hockey puck for a medium burger. Will never eat here again. There is a lot of better restaurants in Vegas then this awful place."}
{"text":"I called in an order for a dozen wings and was told it would be $12 plus tax I then asked the girl who answered the phone so it's a dollar a wing and she said yes I go and pick up my order and bring it back to my hotel to find I only have eight wings I know this is petty but I call to get an explanation.  I'm told by manager Katie that the wings are sold by the pound I told her my conversation of me trying to get a dozen wings and she apologized but did nothing to correct the problem or issue with an unsatisfied customer.  what I think she should've done was try to correct the problem and make a customer happy what they achieved was that a customer will not go back there again and will use social media to explain that you don't actually get 12 wings as a dozen because The are weigh as a pound. Which means. You can get 5 wings if they weigh a pound.  They should try and explain this so customers don't feel like they have been mislead.    Disappointed"}
{"text":"Everything tastes like it was Frozen at one time, maybe not, but then they need to clean out their Reefer? This is the  second time I've visited hoping to try something different, only to be disappointed about it's preparation.  The wings are great as is one of their \"Signature Dishes\" their \"Shephard's Pie,\" but I'm not sure what else is.  My suggestion would be to ask your waitress what is fresh and what started out frozen.  Otherwise it's a Pub, they show sports, you play pool, you drink beer, and you enjoy the view, everything somehow tastes better after you've been there a while."}
{"text":"Awful service! We went when it was slower, sat and waited 15 minutes, with no waitress ever stopping by to even take our drink order! Finally we just left and as we were leaving, the hostess that seated us, told us goodbye, really??? On the floor we saw 4 waitresses, not including the bar waitress, wandering around, no excuse for one of them to not coming by to at least take our drink order. We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Was a regular customer, however after today will never return. I live at apartment property  next door and have been a regular from day 1.  Walked in today there were empty tables and was told there was a 10min wait waited 20 mins and tables were still empty and i was forgotten of by hostess. When i asked the hostess what the deal was she stated \"the tables are reserved for a private party\" i walked out after 10 mins, aparantly tilted kilt does not care about maximizing business on a busy night such as the world series game. Even though i live a short walk away, i will take by business else where. Also bar tenders are not able to multi task other times i have waited up to 10 mins to be served a beer, when there are only 5 patrons sitting at the bar. Bar and food is over priced for the 1 star service this establishment offers. I have never seen so many disapointed patrons walk out of a establishment  as i did today."}
{"text":"All i gotta say is price gouging and plastic cups.  Very disappointed in these guys for super bowl week."}
{"text":"Great place to go out and have some fun and even better food! The service was quick, the food was delicious. I love the atmosphere in there and the staff all seemed to be having a good time working there so i also loved that. Its always nice to be in a place that the people working there like working there. Overall great experience and youll see me soon !:) hopefully for ufc 200!!"}
{"text":"Nasty food,oily tasteless and just plain disgusting. The servers are dressed in kilts but all you see is cleveage and cellulite."}
{"text":"We only drank, so this is all about the staff, atmosphere, and the beer.  Staff:  loved the staff. We sat at the bar and chatted up three different bartenders.  And were checked on by two others. One of the bartenders even photo bombed my drink pic.  LOL.   But the thing that I really appreciated, when we first arrived my wife asked the hostess if they had any ciders.  The hostess asked if my wife was gluten free.  She is.  She was diagnosed with severe gluten allergies earlier this year.  The hostess told my wife they had gluten free beer.  Awesome.  Atmosphere:  was good.  Loved the decor.  I love Irish pubs.  This felt removed from the Vegas glitz, even though it obviously was still part of it.  But, it still had that homey feel I like in pubs.  And I loved the mix the DJ was playing.  Prices were par for Vegas, high for home.  But I can't mark them down for charging to pay the bills.  Now, if corporate reads this, please open one is Pasadena, CA.  It's rare to find a chain that feels like a local pub."}
{"text":"On the way from Allentown, PA to Chicago, IL and wanted a bite to eat. Big fan of TK but walked in this one and it was full of dudes like it usually is....however there was an all guy wait staff. Extremely dissapointing on so many levels. Monday night football in Pittsburgh with the steelers playing....management didn't think this one out. Immediately walked out and went to Bar Louie across the street."}
{"text":"Great experience especially considering it was the second day in business. Miranda's great service helped make it a fun afternoon at the Kilt!  Thanks Miranda"}
{"text":"Lets make this plain and simple. Piss poor service. Waited 15 minutes b4 our cranky server came over. We know we will pay a lot for drinks & food here in downtown. But pass on this place. My PREDICITION!! Out of business by next year this time. Who wants to take this bet?..FINALLY..our Irish waitress never checked on us until she brought us our check. Great training."}
{"text":"First time here! Got stuck in Arizona trying to get back home to Northern California checked out this place, remembered seeing it on under cover boss! Food is good, girls are sweet, entertainment was great. Good vibes, relaxing kick back feel and environment; tvs on with something for everyone sports related."}
{"text":"Went to this location over the weekend and Natasha was a stellar bartender. I met up with some friends and she has a great personality and was super attentive. So it is safe to say I was quite impressed and will be back. Thank you for the great experience."}
{"text":"Forget the argument about sexism or entertainment or whatever.   I know most don't go there for the food but it is absolutely horrible and overpriced.  And you can't help but feel sorry for the \"models.\" Can't call them servers because servers can't get fired when they gain weight. LOL.  Oh and it's a giant sausage fest in there. And not even a bunch of cool fun guys. It's a room full of creepy old dirty men."}
{"text":"Went here on a rainy Sunday afternoon.  With Mom and daughter...it was exceptional.  I am a Fat Bastard Mac&Cheese junkie so it was easy for me.  Sadie's Chicken and kids meal were top notch.  Brianna could not have been more attentive or a better server."}
{"text":"great severice sence the moment i walked into the place.  i place was packed. an i still got service very fast i would highly recomend to my friends an others. JAMEICA is the best. if ur ever in az come too the tilt & kilt on 83rd & peoria. i have been comming here months. now. an she is the best. she remembers my name an has a positive out look on things. an always has a smile that lights up the room.she is very good at what she dose very fast on drinks &food. an the recomendations she suggests is excellent. they r very good drinks & e v en better tasty food. mmmm. an the music is great an if not just ask her what to play u cant go wrong.  they have lots of sports to watch too."}
{"text":"I really didn't think I'd find a place that makes Hooters' food seem good. Here it is, the Tilted Kilt.  I ordered the Cajun Chicken Salad. The chicken had some seasoning on it, but not enough flavor to discern whether or not it was Cajun spices or colored talcum powder. Then, here is where you're going to tell me I went wrong, I really don't like ranch style dressing so I asked to have honey mustard instead. I love mustard and figured the honey and mustard would complement the Cajun spices well. I'm not sure what kind of dressing they put on, but I would have trouble convincing anyone that it was honey mustard. It tasted like the mayonnaise dressing my mother used to put on her Waldorf salad, but worse. It was runny, flavorless, and really only seemed to function to hold the salad in a dome shape. Lastly, it was obvious the tomato used in the salad never reached maturity. It was one of those green tomatoes that are thrown into a room with ethylene gas to turn them red, but really they're just red-colored green tomatoes--crunchy, and absolutely devoid of flavor. Were they trying to use it in place of croutons?  OK, I know you're also going to say, \"You don't go to the Tilted Kilt for the food.\" Yeah, I've heard that one before. Then maybe they should stop serving food. They could just serve nachos and wings, like the bowling alley.  I just have two pieces of advice for this place: Step up your game with your food. Make it taste like what you're billing it as. Cajun chicken should be, well, Cajun! Honey mustard dressing should taste like it has ... wait for it, honey and mustard in it. And, if you can't fix it, take it off the menu. I'd be embarrassed to serve something so awful.  OK, enough of that. Our server was pleasant and nice, but she never once asked me about my meal. Showed no concern whether my meal was good or not. I was a little disappointed by that, but it's probably best. I wasn't in any mood to be dishonest with her.  I ended up paying my bill and jetting. I had some leftover chili from home sitting in the hotel fridge screaming at me to be eaten.  So, yes I know, you don't go to the Tilted Kilt for the food. Then why bother serving food? I'm so over the tired, hackneyed shtick at these places I just want a decent, well-made meal. Maybe someone could put that shtick in a restaurant and actually make food worth eating? What an odd thought?  And finally, just so I can continue this mindless rant. I've had good bar food all over this country. This ain't it."}

{"text":"Ouch this place is depressing.  So, Friday night, need a bar to drink and eat at. Let's go to tilted kilt! (6 guys would obviously say this).  We get there, wait at the front desk for about 5 minutes and do not get seated or even have someone come up to us. The place is literally dead. Maybe 15 people scattered around...  We decide to sit ourselves at a little mid-bar area. We sit down, wait about 10 more minutes for a server to see us and get us menus... They do not come. We see about 4 girls standing and walking around not doing anything...  Our one friend gets up and goes over to one asking if we can get menus and a server and finally someone comes over, explains that normally people wait to be seated....which we explain no one did that for us.  Anyways, We all order, food is typical bar food. Nothing special. The place is very depressing, about eight 40+ year olds just eye-balling the young girls. Keep in mind that there is only about one or two 5/10+ girls there.  We eat, pay, and go to another bar.  I would not recommend. Only positive is they have a lot of TVs for game times."}
{"text":"Sat at bar for 5 minutes while male bartender flirted with females... Worst \"kilt\" in the valley!"}
{"text":"Great plsace for St pattys day!! Staff  (Male & Female ) Friendly & attentive on very busy day. Lots of Tvs for sports. Beer very cold"}
{"text":"I would love to say that this a wonderful place to go, but the only thing great about here is SOME of the girls are actually good looking.  Of course this is why most men go here?   Anyways, the food is at best fair and the service is at best fair.  Again if it weren't for the girls the review would probably worse. The drinks are good, but alcohol always makes you say that."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went to grab a bite to eat here, and the service was very good. Our waitress was friendly and the food was great. Had a Club sandwich, and it was among the best I've had. The atmosphere of the bar is great too, and of course one of the main selling points is how the waitresses are dressed. However, the food is terrific and the bar as a great selection of beers and overall was very pleased with my experience. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it here. I've been wanting to go to a Tilted Kilt since I moved to Arizona because I love sports bars and I think the outfits on the girls are super cute. Well, what a big disappointment this place was!   The food was soooo nasty. I got a flatbread pizza that makes TV dinners seem amazing. My fiance got the ruben and it was bland and DISGUSTING. To top it off, our waitress was an idiot. Another waitress kept coming over and apologizing for her co-worker because she seemed more interested in chatting with the other girls than doing her job. My fiance was super annoyed, I had to calm him down during our dinner!   Also, minus a million stars for the horny old men slipping 20 dollar bills to the servers before even getting their bill. Um sir, that won't make her like you. Eww..."}
{"text":"The food was fine. Typical deep fried pub food. The shepherds pie was actually Luke warm, not hot. Fish and chips were good, not special. The tartar sauce was mainly mayonnaise. Also they charge $.25 extra for an extra tartar sauce.  The beef dip was fine. The service was friendly.  Fairly attentive.  The restaurant was clean.  Would return if in the area."}
{"text":"Great drinks and food. The girls on staff are really cute. The nice thing is the two pool tables."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I feel like I should be enjoying myself more than I actually am. When I first checked out this establishment, I didn't really know it was the T & A \"Hooters\" style establishment with Scottish remix. I certainly didn't shy away from having hot eye candy serving me and they have plenty of that going on for them. But seeing how I am not really a Hooters fan (who really goes for the \"wings\" that food is terrible) I feel like this establishment had a great opportunity to capture me as a fan. It is fairly spacious on the inside so would be nice spot to have a guy's night out. They also typically show most UFC\Boxing and other major sporting events (although there may be a cover) so that was a big plus for me. The menu is much more dynamic than the competition and prepared quite well.  They even have fast free wi-fi guest network named \"Hooters Suck\" which gave me a nice chuckle. So why only two stars you may be wondering? The service is flat out abysmal. I've come during peak times and off peak times but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I can't tell you how many times I've went in and there would be no greeter at the front, sit down at a table and never have one waiter to even ask if I'm being helped. The wait for food is fairly sluggish. I order a mixed drink that clearly wasn't the correct one and I had my kilt gal proceed to tell me that I was wrong even though everybody at my table agreed with my assessment. All it did was prolong it getting fixed when I continued to complain about it. And they always have the AC on full blast so I have to bundle in layers while 90% of the staff is half naked (I guess it keeps them wanting to move or stay \"perky\") I do like the concept and i'm hopeful mgmt. will work to improve service as it has plenty of potential. For now, I can't really recommend this place beyond maybe just having a quick beer at the bar. At the end of the day, I'm will to give up some beauty for brains and sense enough to treat their customers better."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, twice, and dinner once, we love this place now. The food and service is by far excellent. A gentleman by the name of Toby really made us feel like we were at home. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"The service here is pretty horrible. We're here for the NBA finals and wanted to be seated by the big screen TV. Luckily for us, the place was empty. When asking to be seated next to the screen to watch the game, the hostess had an attitude and it had seemed we were asking something out of the ordinary. She left without saying a word. I guess I shouldn't expect amazing service but I couldn't get anything decent."}
{"text":"Wow, service was very poor. We seemed to be an annoyance rather than paying customers. We were planning on entertaining our visitor here all night. Our server seemed so annoyed with us, so taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"So my friends and I had just finished at the Hockey Hall of Fame and we wanted to grab some drinks. One of them wanted to go here since they had heard of it before.  I guess it's famous for the clothes the servers wear. I noticed while walking up that the servers really bend over when helping or talking to customers.   Our server was fine. She was friendly, but not overly flirty. Some people might like the flirty behaviour, but I can't stand that. And it always gets awkward when I have to tell servers not to touch me. And those happen at \"normal\" restaurants.   The best way to describe the Tilted Kilt is that it's like a strip club with no nudity and worse food.  I got the spicy southwest chicken wrap. It wasn't spicy and probably the chicken wasn't from the southwest either. There was nothing bad about it, but it would be the equivalent of fast food. I upgraded to the caesar salad. It's hard to mess up a caesar salad, but they tried their best. The lettuce was warm and the cheese was powdery and the croutons were obviously pre-packed. It wasn't even as good as those packages you can get from the supermarket.  I got a Stella. It was good, about $8.   It's overpriced, but I guess you are paying for cleavage.  Honestly, if you want to see breasts and feel hungry at the same time, just rent Fast Times at Ridgemont High, go to McDonalds and you will save money, and get better quality."}
{"text":"This review is simply based on the friendliness of the staff, not the food. Which yes, is biased and not the reason most people come here. But at the same time, is an instance that needs to be shared.  The last Pitt home game of year, and my iphone falls out of my pocket into a portapotty...  One plastic bag, and three restaurants later, we find ourselves at Tilted Kilt looking for dry rice. Something's different about this place though, and the difference was the hostesses actually cared about my situation, where as the past 3 restaurants were very \"get out of my hair, i have actual customers to serve.\"  So the ladies did it. One to-go box of breads crumbs and some paper towels later, my phone is saved. Much thanks to them.   So if you're in a pickle, they're the kind of people you want on your side."}
{"text":"Get a burger! My brother and I both did and we loved them. Please know I don't normally eat burgers, so I am REALLY picky about burgers. It was delicious. We were there before BSC & Volbeat on a busy Sunday night. The service was great, food delicious, and server friendly and helpful - plus nice eye candy for heterosexual men."}
{"text":"I used to eat here, the service wasnt so great, seemed like the staff was snooty. I only liked 2 items on the menu. If you want good food with good scenery and nice friendly staff go up the road to twin peaks."}
{"text":"Food was good, prices was reasonable. The service was good too, and they made our drinks strong. Yes, it's kind of like hooters but I never felt uncomfortable. I would go again.  I got the black bean wrap and it was delicious."}
{"text":"It's a bar with scantily dressed waitresses more interested in talking to their friends than actually working.  That being said the food is above average and the place is not very busy so plus for that!  Good place to go watch guys try their best pickup lines on girls who willingly play along just to get a better tip,"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer in a perfect location.  The staff is fun and friendly.  We didn't eat here but we went 3 times for beers while we were in Vegas.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the Irish nachos, fantastic twist on nachos.  The cheesesteak had a good flavor but too much bun.   Our server Madison was great, took real great care of our party"}
{"text":"The food was awful. Why anyone would eat here while in Vegas beats me. Countless other dining options to choose from. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Black & Blue, Guiness and Blue Moon- $11, over priced, food was good, french dip, service was great, we had Teresa, she did a great job and we would come back again, no problem"}
{"text":"attractive wait staff, poor service, ok to good food, kind of sticky (it is a bar though) good social setting."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place for football games or just some great wings many a time in the last two years. Been here probably 40+ times with big and small groups and almost always had a great experience.   The inside is clean, the patio has a great view, there's tons of TVs with every conceivable game on at every angle you could look at, and they sometimes even throw my Browns up on the big screens, which is nice. I usually order the TK Signature Sauce wings for a great sweet/spicy mix, and they've always got a decent beer selection with great seasonals to wash it down with.  Kelly, our server last time, was prompt, hilarious, and kept us supplied with wings and alcohol to our heart's content, and even talked Star Wars with us during half-time. It's great to have servers that add the personal touch like that.  Look, it's not the Ritz Carlton. It's a sports bar with a bunch of ladies trying to get through college running around and serving food and beer in not much clothing. I think the place is perfect for what it is: a great unsophisticated way to kill a Sunday.  Four stars though because I suppose it's just a tad expensive for bar food. Anyone whining about parking apparently doesn't know that A) there's a giant garage underneath their feet and B) they're happy to validate it."}
{"text":"Great time!   Tilted Kilt has an AMAZING Tilted Tea drink. WOW. So amazingly delicious.   Amazing chips and salsa.   Great place to come with friends to just chill and have a great time. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Been to one been to them all. It's not really my scene but don't get me wrong if you're with a group of guys and want to watch the games it will suit your needs."}
{"text":"We wanted somewhere to go on a Thursday night where we could eat, drink, talk and be entertained.  This was the perfect place.  We loved people watching.  It was ladies night so wine was $4 a glass (although don't expect good wine, they only had 3 choices).  I requested they basically combine a couple of items to create what I wanted to eat.  I didn't expect they would say yes, but they did it and it was good.  The waitress was attentive and pleasant.  This may become a regular Thursday night hangout."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed two night here for cocktails and appetizers ...Carl is a great bartender , he remembered our names and what we drank the second evening...we also think the Kilts are adorable on the girls as well the guys ... We tried to purchase a calendar of the young gentlemen and were informed they don't have one ..well there are two of us at least that would of liked one!"}
{"text":"If you like hanging out w skids and wanna have dirty hands cuz you cant get any napkins then this is the place for you. A Complete shit show. Hey who wants to watch the NHL playoffs when they got Red Bull sailing on and the fucking shopping channel. GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER you fucking clowns."}
{"text":"Heather did an amazing job-friendly and social. Good service. Not the ditzy bartender I expected. I'll be back all the time. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Monday night during a Raptor's game.  Huge screens in the bar were a great way to see the game.   We were seated and then about 10 mins later our waitress showed up.  Waitress asked for our drink order, which came back wrong.  Once we gave our food order I was a little concerned because our waitress seemed so out of it.  Once I finally got my drink (10 mins later), the food showed up.  The other person in my party got half her order right (chicken wings), but no poutine (only fries).   My order was completely wrong and had to be sent back (a steak sandwich instead of a steak salad).  Once the salad showed up, the other person in my party had already been done for 5 mins.  While I was waiting for my salad, I asked for another drink but still had about 1/4 of my drink left (I thought I was being proactive).  The waitress tried to take my drink before I was done.  After this she delivered several shots to the table next to us and proceeded to do several shots with that table.  She was clearly drunk or under the influence. She kept repeating herself to us and asking redundant questions, but still screwed up the orders.  We were given a discount because of bad timing,  but will likely never return.  Service was horrible and food was underwhelming.  I might go back for drinks at the bar to watch a game, but won't expect much more."}
{"text":"$5 draft beer was a little pricey but let me be honest, we didn't go for the beer. The Tuesday night crew took good care of us and never left our glass empty. Didn't eat just because we had just eaten at a local diner. For a bar of its kind it was very clean I must say."}
{"text":"The place is A-OK but the food in my opinion is very bland.  I would not eat here again.  If you are not eating there is a good beer selection and the bar is nice.  They also have outside seating and it is located close to Heinz field and PNC park.   There are girls (and guys) in kilts if that is your thing."}
{"text":"After having heard so much about Tilted Kilt, I finally got a chance to go this past weekend (only to witness CAL demolish ASU).  :'(  The place wasn't too packed for the game (I'm guessing they were all at Four Peaks or San Tan), so we had some good seats right in front of one of the projection screens.  The ASU game was quite painful to watch, so I was relieved to be able to watch the AUB LSU game on the center screen without too much effort.  The beers came out cold (Sierra NV yeah!), and we even had a penny beer token thingy-ma-jig that the birthday boy in our group claimed for a Kilt Lifter.  The waitress didn't even take the token away.  Sweet!  Our waitress was cool and came by every once in a while to check up on us.  She didn't even ask if we wanted separate checks - she just came by with all of them separated out (+1 bonus point).  One gripe I had came from my food order.  I ordered fries at the same time someone else ordered a wrap (which comes with fries).  My order of fries came out 15-20 minutes after the wrap+fries came out.  What the heck?  I'm hungry!  The fries were pretty good by the way, and came in a decent-sized portion."}
{"text":"I love this location! The waitresses are always so warm and welcoming. It's a casual, laid back place that's great if you wanna eat some good food and enjoy a couple of cold beers. I definitely would recommend it"}
{"text":"Any place that claims to be an Irish Pub and serves instant mashed potatoes with their Shepherd's Pie should not be frequented.    I was very dissapointed in the service (we were there for almost and hour and I never got a refill) and the food was sorely lacking.  I could care less that the girls were barely dressed, for the price of the food and beer I was expecting much better food, but alas, it's just a Hooter's with less clothes and worse food.   I was hoping this would be another great addition to the numerous Irish themed restaurants and bars but given the prices and the quality of the food, even though I work a stones throw away, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"What a great looking bar. Too bad that's where the good things stop. We decided to stop in for a couple drinks before last night's Foo Fighters show. Little did we know they would be so woefully understaffed. Maybe if the 3 bartenders balanced their attention between the inside customers as well as the outside, I would return. Sadly, I will not. I'd love to give a food review, but something tells me, I'd still be waiting. (tip for the owners...when you have big events downtown, please plan your staffing. Downtown Phoenix is trying to \"rise from the ashes\" and your not helping.)"}
{"text":"Never been here.   Tried to go, but couldn't.  At 10:43 pm on a Tuesday night it was dark and closed.  They have not earned the right to call themselves any sort of a Celtic pub.  They should just rename themselves to \"Closed.\"  I guess being routinely closed is a good way to avoid bad yelps, cuz if nobody can go there, what bad things could they possibly say except \"closed\".  - Cheese Louise"}
{"text":"Great food for a good price. I have not had a single bad experience here in over a year of being a regular. If you come and are over 21, sit at the bar as the bartenders here are the best."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out for awhile now since we didn't get to check the one out in San Diego and heard a lot of good things about it. The hostesses were kind of rude as we entered are you supposed to greet every guest upon arrival not the other way around? Anyways the waitress was more interested in tables of only guys to flirt with than myself and my boyfriend. Everything took forever to come out and the food was just mediocre better pubs out there!!. Hostess told me I couldn't get a game on and then I see it on the other side of the room so that ticked me off they just are too lazy to ask or do anything. Don't plan on coming back not worth it."}
{"text":"Typical contrived environment... Themed Irish bar. Lots of minimally dressed waitresses. Flesh everywhere. Drinks are way over priced but if you like the other features, then it's an ok joint."}
{"text":"The service here is NOT good. Took forever for them to bring the food with only 15 people in the whole restaurant. Then when it arrived it was not right had to send it back. Then took another 15 min to get nachos back.  Not worth it to come here just FYI"}
{"text":"The worst service ever! 10 minutes before anyone came to my table. Made an order of the garlic/parm fries and shepherd's pie. Food came and just got regular fries. Waitress did bring us out the correct ones after another 10 mins. The shepherd's pie was awful, like really bad. So was the iced tea (it had a funk to it). The fries were the only thing good about our experience at the Tilted Kilt on the Strip."}
{"text":"Bam, Great place if you work or live around down town for a quick Lunch!! Always love taking the boys here for an hour or two break in the middle of the weekly grind. Great Service/Beers on draft.. It's a homerun slamdunk for a Touchdown"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple of drinks. Could have gotten 5 stars, but bar tender had a moustache, and great tits."}
{"text":"awful.  Food was not good; small portions and prepared poorly.  Atmosphere was WAY too noisy even for a sports-bar type place ...we couldn't hear each other talk.  Pretty girls can't make up for terrible food. won't be back."}
{"text":"It's a decent place to have a few drinks. The waitresses are attractive and the bar has a pretty cool layout. The irish theme stops with the plaid on the mini skirts of the servers. The food is not particulary good, but it's bar food, so what do I expect, right?   Unfortunately \"it's OK\" is the best I can say about this place and the only reason I rate it that high is because I REALLY like boobies."}
{"text":"I called their Tempe location to ask a few questions about the Halloween party tonight and experienced clueless workers. How about making available some answers to FAQ's so workers can refer to those notes if someone calls and not subject them to clueless workers with non-answers?  I tried emailing management earlier in the week and received no replies, even after multiple attempts.  I emailed:   tcarlos@tiltedkilt.com and  gm102@tiltedkilt.com  which I got from the Tilted Kilt web site.  No reply"}
{"text":"There is a bartender here (Kelly) who is the best ever.  Friendly, attentive and most of all great personality.  My friend and I visited quite a few times while in Vegas and she even knew our names.  First class - thanks for making our trip to Vegas memorable!!"}
{"text":"I went in ordered a tea and not only did I get no milk I also got no spoon.  I had to use my finger but mistakes happen.  After ordering the breakfast I noticed the bacon and Sausages were burnt and even the toast seem over done.  After the first few bits I said to the server and she said I can get you more bacon and Sausage.  I took one or two more bites.  Then decided this is so awful I cannot eat any more.  I told the server I just want the bill and was charged full price the only thing they removed was the tea.  I then asked to speak to the manager who got very defensive saying well he had no complaints about this."}
{"text":"We went for the first time during super bowl. We got a table right away. The service was a bit slow to start but once she got us in the rotation it certainly wasn't bad. The food was ok. Nothing to write home about. Don't get me wrong there was nothing wrong with it. The burger came out on a busy, BUSY night prepared as requested (medium) & hot. Everything we ordered came out & no weirdness. I just wasn't a fan of the food. The atmosphere was fun & yes the server had a killer bod. We'll be back for happy hour & try some other stuff but the food so far mediocre. Happy hour pricing & atmosphere will make it or break it for me next time. Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"There was another review that summed up this pub chain eloquently - \"Hooters in tartan\". Go in expecting that, and you'll have a good experience.  This location is... interesting. As I had never been to a Tilted Kilt before (and my group of friends and I had been told at the nearby West 50 that they didn't want anyone of our... certain demeanor), we walked down the street to this place. There wasn't any hostess to greet us at the door, so we simply walked in and found a table.  As we simply went in for drinks on our way to a pho restaurant, I have no opinion of the food. The bartender(manager?) was surprisingly nice and offered to play anything we wanted on the big-screen television at the back of the pub. Our server was an... interesting woman who sported a nosering and was wearing a skirt that was way too short.  The worst part of the night was trying to get our server to give us separate bills, but she repeatedly screwed up and had no idea about how to calculate simple concepts (like a pitcher of beer divided between everyone). Other than that, it was a solid, non-offensive experience.  Don't know if I'd necessarily recommend them, but I've been to worse pubs."}
{"text":"Sweet merciful Christ.  This is now my second time visiting a Tilted Kilt (the first was at the Mississauga location), and I'm even more disappointed than before. While the chain is at least a cut above Hooters, that's not saying much when the experience is generally underwhelming all around.  On our journey around the Esplanade during a pre-St. Patricks Day pub crawl, one of our friends suggested checking this place out. Half our group had never been to a Tilted Kilt before, and were all scandalized when they discovered the dress code for the waitresses - which is to say, not much. Those plaid bras and barely-there skirts don't make up for the fact that the rest of the customer experience is just subpar.  Our waitress was very good, constantly checking in on us. It was clear to me that she was a talkative sort, as she told me all about the pub's plans for St. Patrick's Day and how many people were planning to attend. Seemed like a nice girl, who clearly put up with way too much from other patrons (not to mention the clothing that crossed the line from titilating to just plain trashy) and was happy to have a normal conversation with customers who looked past the trappings of the brand.  I can't say the same for the rest of the servers, who generally looked lost or just didn't care. There was what I assumed to be a homeless man who sort-of drifted in, used the washroom and then hung around in the middle of the bar, bobbing around as he watched a hockey game on the TV above while the waitresses tried to dodge past, making for a strange sight.  I also have to give umbrage with the washroom set up. It's supposed to be a mixed-use washroom with male and female stalls, but everyone disregards these signs, there are lineups all the time and they could stand to be cleaned more often.  As far as what we ordered:  Sweet potato fries (mine): Slightly burnt, didn't come with any mayo (which you think would be standard), and disappointing.  Mozzarella sticks (friend's): I tried one and was confused. I don't know if they weren't properly cooked or the cheese is processed, but it just tasted off.  Nachos: A smaller order than my group had at the Wheat Sheaf Tavern last week, but technically proficient.  Just before we grabbed our bills, the place became a zoo. People filter in here en masse after any game at the nearby Air Canada Centre, and the place quickly becomes unruly and chaotic. We had a group of at least ten people all try to cram into a six-person booth beside us, with a group of people standing behind my chair and constantly kicking it. Suffice to say, we got out as quick as we could.  With these kinds of chain restaurants, the general atmosphere of the place is the key difference. While our server was good, the rest of the staff and general attitude felt very lax, and I can't see myself coming back here again.  Might be worth a look as a quick drop-in, but avoid otherwise."}
{"text":"It was like a more sexualized version of Hooters, with way crappier food."}
{"text":"As I travel for a living I've been to just about every Kilt. All were acceptable till now. The Ladies were great, very friendly and professional. The beer was just off of piss warm, and the burger was supposed to be covered with chili and melted Monterey Jack cheese. It was a microwave patty with nasty can chili and yellow canned cheese like jelly. It was disgusting. This is a Manager that neither cares about repeat business, nor eats at his own Establishment. I don't see how they keep the Tilted Kilt name."}
{"text":"I didn't actually realize the type of restaurant that this was before I went, so that sure was a suprise.  I didn't really care that much for the food though and doubt I would go back. This just wasn't what I had in mind when I was looking for an Irish restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a review in progress.   I was seated by the hostess and now I've been waiting for 20 minutes for a server to take my order. Haven't even been greeted by a server. Many workers have walked right past me and not offered to help at all. Normally I would leave by now but I kind of want to see how long this will go.  It took 21 minutes.  Got a beer and server is very sweet and apologetic. Moving up to 2 stars.  It didn't get any better.   They ended up giving me my entire meal for free."}
{"text":"Eye candy - above average. Food - average / slightly above. Would go again!  Reading the reviews on this place, it looks like people expected a 5 star restaurant in atmosphere, food and service. Think people need to save the over judgemental review for a place that claims to be top notch. Not one that is based on short skirts and tight skimpy shirts!!"}
{"text":"I think the guy who wrote \"Scottish Hooters\" called it.  It was a good place to go after Heart Attack Grill, but now they're closed, so I never go down there..."}
{"text":"Went here because my sister's friend's husband owns this place and we were stopping in to such chill for a little bit because it was humid outside in late July. We ended up getting the Poutine there and it was to die for. The gravy is certainly different from the gravy is the U.S or at least the gravy that I have been eating since growing up and definitely different and thicker than you average IKEA swedish meatball gravy. The presentation was fabulous and we enjoyed the dish. The servers were great. We sat at the bar and watched the game/news. Not that busy at 12pm on a work day. The uniforms are unique and the overall place was clean, and a nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Dart boards and filled with other fun venues. Great beer selection. Good service. Worth stopping by before or after a game."}
{"text":"It's funny what people write as reviews. They have no idea how restaurants work and complain and say it's the serves fault or of the hostess. No. When you go to a sports bar or the such its gonna be hard to hear. You don't go to places like that for quite conversation. Duh. And when does food ever look like the picture. Anyways. The food was awesome. Came here with girlfriend for date and had great time. Had great service. The fried pickles were amazing. And fish tacos were to die for. Thank you guys for the good time. Don't listen to idiots talking about things they know nothing about."}
{"text":"Service was very slow while the place was pretty empty. While the server was very sweet she worked at a snails pace to bring our drinks, take our order, food took over 40 minutes (kitchens fault unless she forgot to ring it in), took extra long to cash out. Food was pretty good and willing to give this another chance."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat in this genre, so much better than Hooters when it comes to food. The Classic fish and chips rocks. The staff is always smiling and friendly when I come in and it has a nice Irish pub mixed with modern sports bar decor. Ate there today and it did not dissapoint!"}
{"text":"I have never written one of these. I understand it was St. Pattys day in area but it was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. Had to find manager to be seated, get server, and anything. We bought all our cocktails from beer girl not server! After an hour of waiting for food... we left. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and looks are all this place has to offer. The food was sub par and the service was horrible from the start. Girl seating us was not at all friendly or greeting.  We waited approximately 8-10 min before being seen by our waitress. Drinks went empty 2x and delay in food was 40-45 min for our burgers. We had to go get utensils from another table on our own. Wife ordered well done. The burger was closer to medium with alot of pink inside. The portion of fries was a McDonald's small at best. My burger was uneventful but not bad. The elderly woman behind us had a drink spilled on her by the staff (accidents happen and the guy that spilled it was very apologetic) it soaked her, her purse and the table. The couple had to clean it up mostly by themselves as the staff had to take off to get napkins (approx 5 min) I overheard the manager offer them a lousy 20% discount. The couple was just eager to leave. The manager offered to remove my wife's burger from the tab (which about 90% of the burger remained uneaten) which is the reason for the second star. It sounds like im just trying to trash the place but this was honestly our entire experience.  I'd recommend both Hooters and Twin Peaks over this place if looking for similar atmosphere.   The poor management completely dropped the ball with hiring this staff. Great location and concept but failed to deliver in every aspect of customer service."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed with this place. 1st the bar is not laid out well you have to reach over counter to get your drink. 2nd the wait time for service took to long and seems if your a regular they get priority and don't take care if all customers equally. Maybe not hire all 18 yr olds would accomplish this goal."}
{"text":"If there is a place where u get the worst service in town it's this place, have to look for my server every time I want to order. Shame on the person running the place."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ. The first time I came here it was a solid experience. But woah, I came here for the second time and the food was just BEYOND salty. I ordered the sampler, but couldn't do it. Way too much salt. Then I ordered the chicken mother clucker or whatever they call it, and it was also way tooooo salty. I'm not sure if the cool was new or what the hell was going on, but I could barely enjoy my meal. I don't even complain rarely. But I guess that salt made me feel salty about this experience"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a buddy for lunch. Ordered the   Pub fried egg burger with fries. Burger could have used more seasoning but was cooked to my liking. Received good service. Server recommended a seasonal beer which was tasty."}
{"text":"Nasty food and along time to wait for it - our server jennifer was nice but its JUST NOT GOOOOOOD.  Oh ya and there is DUDES in kilts.  WTF"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. Waited 35 minutes for 3 orders tonight. Waitress forgot drinks on 2 trips, we had to ask a passing waitress for a refill. No manager walking around. The scenery is weak too. Would expect a stronger staff for that location. This was the 3rd time in a row I had a bad experience. Stick with Majerles or Cooperstown for great service."}
{"text":"Friday night at 7pm in a busy Arrowhead area, this place was empty. We found out why. Server was only by once after food was delivered. Waiting 30 minutes for a check. I thought the downtown location was bad. Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"This place is a total dump. Our waitdresses/bartenders looked like they were 16 years old and were more intetested in talking with the regulars. Bar was unkept, they were out of 2 kinds of liquor, was never offered a menu, etc....The managers/owners need to be aware...this place does not live up to the tilted kilt name."}
{"text":"Absolute worst restaurant we have ever been to. Service couldn't have been worse. Morons working in kitchen. Food took an hour and a half and was terrible. Beer tasted like goat urine. Highly recommend you never dine here."}
{"text":"The sizes are okay, but nothing that great and it all tasted rather plain Jane. I went during restaurant week and I would have gotten the deal but it was 2 for 30 and my tinkleheaded friend was not paying attention when i mentioned the deal and when I asked if she was going to do it, she said no but ended up ordering something off the menu after I ordered and I did not want to make a fuss and change. We lost out of appetizers and a dessert for the same price. Choose your friends wisely.... Anyways, that visit was not my first time and each time I thought that it was on the higher side of a price for what you get. I got the cheddar soup the first time which was nice but uneventful or barely rememberable. The waitresses looked like a trip to an American high school if the girls were very much into Irish scant dress. I did not mind that as a single guy, I would have felt as happy at Hooter's but that is probably why i am single. My life. Anyways, the burgers are smaller and the fry serving was good since I got to eat mine and my friends. The bathrooms were clean and had tellys above the willies which was nice. The visit was nothing great and if I am there and don't want to go elsewhere I will stop by again and be unimpressed again."}
{"text":"Wow. Good food and Heather totally went above and beyond. Very friendly and great service!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here on a whim b/c everywhere else had such a long wait time. This place is kind of hidden in an alley way by the flamingo which it is newly renovated and looks awesome! The girls were super nice and the food was surprisingly really good. I had the \"Muther clucker chicekn sandwich\" and that was delicious. Definitely a sportsbar with tons of TV. All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"A friend from Seaside Highland Games recommended this place so had the check it.out. Hubby & I sat at the bar, the bartender & 2 other girls walked by us. No ine even acknowledged us. The bartender walked by us 3 times and she wasnt busy :(  So we went to O'Sheas and bartender Mike hooked us up"}
{"text":"Thank you to the manager and the staff for accommodating our huge and last minute group on the 28th of October!  The bier market was full and they didn't accommodate us so we left and came to tilted kilt. It was great and a fun time! Everyone was so nice and our food and drinks came in smoothly.  I'm really grateful that they helped us get seats and reserve other tables even on a game night.   Will definitely come here again for the great service!"}
{"text":"Went there after a Diamondbacks games. Got seated right away service was great and food was really good. Can't go wrong with Magie Maes Fish and Chips and the cold beer."}
{"text":"Always a favorite when I'm in Phoenix. Service is always great beer is cold and the food is always tasty"}
{"text":"Tasted like food from Applebees with the ambiance of a Hooters.  Actually that's a diss to Applebee's as their food has actually gotten better and it's a better value. We ordered the sampler ($14) and it came with 4 boneless chix bites, 4 skinny mozzarella sticks, fried pickles and 1 tasteless pretzel bread. We weren't impressed as ive tasted better mozzarella sticks from the freezer section of Costco.  Lol.   We decided to split an entree to save us both a disappointment and share in the misery. We got the BBQ pork Mac and cheese. It sounded good. Something you'd hear on diner, drives and dives. Well it wasn't very good. At all. BBQ sauce was sweet, pork was flavorless, the macaroni was chewy and the cheese sauce tasted like that cheese pack you get in the Kraft box.   As a plus they have daily drink specials...tequila Tuesdays and so forth and two happy hours. Server was nice, but don't expect service that excels. We didn't eat more than a few bites of the entree and the server didn't bother to ask why.  We wont be back. Yard house at least has good food."}
{"text":"Just terrible.  Sign outside says $5 drafts - night special, Tilted Kilt night.  Great, we say!  We'd love a happy hour draft on a hot day.  We walk in, find a seat at the crowded bar, and order two Miller Lites.  Bill comes, and we're charged $16.  What!?  I ask, he tells me the $5 is for industry night, and only applies to those in industry.  What does that even mean?  I say the sign does not say that, and he argues it does.  I go out to the sign three times to confirm, and every time tell him it does not.  He says, well you're wrong, but because you're causing an issue, I will just charge you $10.  Of course you will, because I am not wrong (and, isn't the customer always right anyways?), and you really should check your signs, and honor them.  Maybe most of the people that come in here have really taken Vegas to the extreme so do not notice the bill, but that's just dishonest business.  Never again in this location.  Never again in any location."}
{"text":"Grossly understaffed. Waited 2 hours. While waiting for a table, we saw a half drank Gatorade bottle in the ice container where they would get ice for the cocktails. At one point the bartender scooped the container up with the ice and just moved it to the side and proceeded to scoop more ice from the same spot to make someone's drink.  Food wasn't worth the money and it was cold by the time we got silverware and napkins."}
{"text":"Went here twice this week once on Saturday and again on Monday, after my Saturday visit this place would have received a solid 5-Star rating, but Monday came along and it was just sort of okay. Plenty of help on Saturday, not so much on Monday, Saturday also seemed to have all the seasoned help, Monday appeared to have all the new employees fumbling around. I liked the food and the portions were decent, not huge but enough to fill you up. Good location by the Linq, reasonable prices for the location and well kept as in clean, a big plus for the wife.   If you are in the area on a weekend you should be able to get in and out quickly if you want, as I mentioned earlier Monday was a bit of a challenge. As there appeared to be just two waitress taking orders and at least ours didn't have time to check back with us to take our order, beyond our drinks and appetizers. One of the bussers finally got her attention for us and we were able to order our meal. Saturday everything flowed like a well oiled machine, no sooner than our appetizers were done and we were getting refills on our drinks along with our main course.   Another big difference between the two nights, even though the crowd seemed to be about the same the volume level on Saturday was at a modest level, You could talk without having raise your voice, but Monday the music was considerably louder.   All in all a decent meal at reasonable prices especially when you take into account the location, I would go back but I'll check to see how many servers they have working before taking a seat."}
{"text":"Wow.  Been to Chicago location Myrtle Breach location and Robinson Pa location.  By far the worst service    Great experience at other locations.  Very slow at time we were there but waitresses must have been very busy cause we had a hard time finding one.  Or maybe because half of them sitting at table with customers.  The entire time we ate which was a long time.   Did I mention the table they were sitting at was right where you enter the restaurant.  I don't pretend to be an expert but I do run a business and if I owned this restaurant I would freak out if I observed the behavior of this crew."}
{"text":"We waited a long time for a waitress to even take our drink order. Then she brought the drinks out hit the table with the tray and made a mess. Didn't apologize because she got one of our guess all wet. Finally took our food order. Never came around for drink refills and our food was cold when it came out. Now I know why this was our first time there and last. Worse service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is well below average. The service was not good. My friend asked for blue cheese and never got it. I ordered water and she never brought it so I just drank my friends water. There weren't that many people in the restaurant when we were there, I don't understand how our requests were not getting carried out. The prices are higher than it should for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Me and a bud when out to eat, he is single and wanted to go to this place.  we asked if we could sit nearest the TV with the hockey game on... ignored, After seated far and behind the hockey game screen, we waited for thirty minutes before we had to ask if we had a waiter/ waitress? after another five minutes we left, nothing was said on the way out.  Menu seemed fun, nothing really Irish, but seemed good for not hungry and testosterone filled men."}
{"text":"WHAT THE WHAT? Went on a Friday night, not busy at all, service terrible. limited menu items available. we left. I use to like going here with my friends. but the experience is probably over rated. you can go anywhere and see half dressed females (for the guys) what  else ya' got?"}
{"text":"I heard they was about to revamp this place, and in a way they did. A smaller more dense menu and a focus on what I feel they can handle. Kudos to this initiative.   Again, my previous comment stands - this place is what it is, and nobody comes here for a gastronomical adventure. Service is good.   Today's panegyric (yes, its a word) is to the manager of this place. We always give homage to the foot soldiers, and much deserved so - but today I want to let yelpers know that this beautiful girl is running a tight ship. It is clear that she takes her job seriously and personal, and dare I claim that she would take any complaint to heart and do what is within her power to fix it, if possible. I witnessed that today. That impressed me.   So to whatever-your-name-is-manager at this establishment. Nicely done.. and keep looking so confident. It motivates."}
{"text":"I struggled between giving 2 or 3 stars, two and half is definitely where this restaurant should be. I gave it 3 because of the free appetizer with check in. Food was average for a restaurant/bar, really nothing wrong there...3 stars. Atmosphere was ok, it was a raining night so maybe that's why the restaurant side was dead, and about twenty people around the bar area for a weekend night...2 1/2 stars. Service was horrible the waitress was more interested in the table which I assume was her boyfriend and his friends, where she would sit for five minutes at a time in between helping people. We had to ask for napkins, silverware and refills as she would pass by trying to go back to her friends booth...1 star. Maybe just an off night but I have a feeling this is a typical experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the shepherds pie and it was quite good. Nice salad to start. I did not realize how the waitresses dressed however our server was very nice and chatted with me and my wife. Just be prepared for young girls in tiny outfits. Some may like that and some may want to avoid it. But don't let the food and beer be why you don't go."}
{"text":"Went here for Raps vs. Heat game 7. An awesome setting for the game. Also ordered multiple items off their menu. Had the platter,which was missing the mozza stick(understandably ran out) and later replaced by some inedible overly salted fries. Tried the pulled pork sandwich which was suprisingly very good. Don't bother with the coleslaw- it will ruin your whole meal. Also shared the fish tacos. Oh man what a mistake it was. Never tasted something so tasteless. Absolutely no flavour at all. It is a really nice place to catch the game but don't count on their menu to hit your cravings."}
{"text":"I loathe this place. Partly because its a faux Irish pub*, partly because the service sucks and the food is mediocre at best.   I go to bars for good drinks and good food.  If the staff is hot girls in skimpy outfits, that can be a bonus, not a replacement for the other two.  There are places doing the \"hot waitstaff\" concept much better, find one and go there. Or better yet, find a bar you like that just happens to have a cute bartender, and be a regular there!  *True story, was once having a bad day and needed a good Irish whiskey to cheer me up. I asked what their selection was and after ~5 minutes of searching their backbar they found a (singular) dusty bottle of bushmill's. Nothing else... weak sauce!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the worst \"sports bars\" I've ever been in. The service was terrible and slow. The place was understaffed and the atmosphere was bland.   We sat down and were given two menus at 6 pm. One was a lunch menu and the girl told us we couldn't order from it anymore. Our server (who many have the prettiest smile I've ever seen) didn't know what beers were on tap and wasn't sure if they carried cider. Wait, this is a bar, right?   Our order took 45 minutes (a wrap and burger) and she came back twice (drinks were empty after 10 minutes). I don't blame her, however. She and another girl were running in the entire restaurant, including the bar. Poor staffing all the way around.   Not much positive to report - except there's likely going to be an open table, even an hour prior to the Flames game, like this was."}
{"text":"Popped in here before the arena football game last night. What a great addition to Cityscape. They had several great beers on tap and in bottle, great atmosphere and of course tons of good looking servers. The prices were great and it seemed like a relatively popular spot. My only issue is that it's a pretty close match to Copper Blues on the other side of Cityscape, but I think they'll do great being that close to the stadium."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a chain I believe and this one is located in the area by the High Roller.   There were 15 of us and it was Monday night around 7 PM and it was so crowded we ended up hanging around the bar area in different groups. They had a great selection of Draught beer (+1) and a full bar.   We basically drank adult beverages and everyone ordered appetizers.  I had the boneless wings with buffalo sauce and it was nothing unique.  It was noisy, crowded but service as good.  It is a nice place to hang out.   I would  give it a 3."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Guinness BBQ sauce is amazing on the wings! Great nachos and quesadilla. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good place, good food, great location. I don't go to drool over the girls or break my neck looking like the other losers that go there but be prepared to pay for the scenery anyways. I like the bar area which has plenty of seating and many hd tv's. I would have given it 3.5 stars but you cannot do that. The only downside being it is a tad pricey. They do have drink specials here and there and for the most part the bartenders do make full pours on the draft beers. I always say I will take my head on the side. Most of the girls are nice but I get it most of the guys hit on them non-stop so that probably wears on them so you might get some less than attentive service from time to time. 2 things, 1st I wish more women would go there I feel creepy going in and sitting at the bar and it's like 5 dudes all of them by themselves and 2 seats inbetween each other, not a strip club guys. 2nd how awesome would it be if they had some mid to late 30's women working there! Like a fine wine I guess."}
{"text":"The girls and atmosphere were the only things good about the place. Worst food experience I've had at a bar. Don't order the Paddy Melt and the garlic fries were served cold."}
{"text":"I debated between 1 and 3 stars. I will settle on 2 and be nice.   The wait staff is half naked and the men love it. I really didn't care either way.  I did notice that besides the employees there was about 100 people there and only 5 were girls!  YIKES!  The service was crappy at best. The drinks went back and forth.. some were strong and good other tasted like they forgot to add the vodka.   I have eaten food from here 1 time. I had the artichoke pasta and that was good. It's the only reason I gave this place 2 stars.   I wouldn't think this is a great place to bring your date. As a girl you can't help but be all ignored and what not.  I wouldn't even say its a great place to hang out if you want to meet someone other than other men.   The men here all act like they have money because they are in Scottsdale. Looking around the parking lot you can tell most of them do not.   The wait staff seems to not give 2 craps about their tables and all hang out with the regulars and ignore everyone else.    So if you are looking for a place to hang out with a bunch of broke posers, half naked women who will ignore you, crappy service,  week drinks, and an over priced menu come here.   PS. When I came they weren't showing any sports just music videos that were just a little too loud."}
{"text":"The only downside to this place is that it can turn into a regular hot dog cart sometimes! The non-staff guy to girl ratio is pry 3:1 (best case). But the ladies that work there are very easy on the eyes, and are wearing skimpy outfits! So if your looking for 1) watching sexy babes - light on the clothes 2) drinking beer 3) watching sports.. i can think of no better place.. As for a Hooters comparison, i would go here anyday over Hooters."}
{"text":"Great burger! Awesome beer selection had my favorit Leinenkugels summer shandy! The best part was our server! She was so attentive and pretty you go Tessa!!!"}
{"text":"Best wings! Love them. Great place for a game. Service is good, not great but good. Not problems some mention. I actually like this location more than most others I've been to so far. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow....slowest service ever experienced. Food was good but I chose to spend the tips on a donation to special needs education so Megan can get the chance that she deserves."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports, the food and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Wasn't busy for lunch, and the server still screwed up my order.  The burger was just OK, and the veges not so much.  Cute girls, but I want the great food to go with it.  Had a better experience at the Cleveland location, so stuff happens, but I won't return to this one."}
{"text":"Love this place. The bartenders Danny and Emmy are the most amazing people I've met in Vegas, period! I went here because we also have a Tilted Kilt in Boca Raton, Florida, so therefore I wanted to compare the one here to the one in my hometown. These guys are a paragon of perfection in terms of friendliness and customer service. I tried to buy Danny & Emmy shots when they were done working but they absolutely insisted that they paid, even after I plopped cash on the bar they threw it back at me. I've never experienced that in all my travels. These guys are real folks; Go visit and say hello!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times. Usually before I go to the casino.  A little pricey..   I don't care too much for the meals I have had. A little bland. Seems more of a corporate place."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is good. Even on St. Paddy's Day when they were packed, we were seated right away and the waitress took care of us."}
{"text":"Four stars from the husband and the visiting son because they liked the outfits the servers wore.  I ordered and liked the shepherd's pie; so no argument from me.    It was much better than being dragged to Hooters."}
{"text":"Food was yummo! My friends had the SOB burger and the Wicked Boston Burger = delicious!  I had the TK boneless wings, very tasty no heat though (which is what I prefer) and garlic fries which were seasoned perfect.  Our waitress Michelle was very personable and attentive!  We Had Celtic Mule and a Bloody Mary for drinks and those were on pOint! Will definitely return, our goal is to try each restaurant at the Linq, and this one is a must.... highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The Arrowhead location puts this one to shame in every way. The Scottsdale attitude is almost over the top at this location. Hello, you work for tips right? It was Friday during lunch and also Barrett Jackson just kicked off, so it may have been busier than most days.   I had the chicken tenders and they seemed like they may not have been completely cooked through. Thank god for the mountain of fries to accompany it. Due to it being packed, I did not bother making mention of it to the waitress as it would likely have taken 20 minutes to prepare another basket.   I have been to this location about 4 times in all over the past couple of years. It may be fun for a guy who has not been before, but does not hold enough interest to keep coming back on a regular basis IMO."}
{"text":"We live in the apartments behind the new location and are really disappointed with the new location so far. We got there on a Saturday night and despite not being too busy it took them about 15 minutes to seat us. Once seated we were greeted by the \"Newcastle girls\" who promptly got the guys beers. After another 20 minutes we met our waitress who took our drink order. She forgot the my drink and I finally got it after 45 minutes in the restaurant. About an hour into being there and seeing our waitress twice, we asked the Newcastle girls to please get her so that we could order. She came back very irritated and tried to leave THREE times while we were ordering. I felt like we needed to hold onto her to keep her at the table to take our order. The food was sub par at best and very hard to enjoy with a table full of empty plates and cups that were never cleaned up. The waitress also told us they did not have malt vinegar to go with the fish and chips. We got another waitress who found some and gave it to us. Two hours after arriving the waitress told us she was done and closed us out. We saw her an hour later serving other tables. This is so sad because it is so close to us but multiple people in our complex have said that they are very disappointed with the service. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We visited The Tilted Kilt at The Linq in Las Vegas for our Sunday Funday afternoon lunch. It's not my first visit but this is my first time reviewing. I like this place. Especially on Sundays when the games are on. There are plenty of large screen televisions and multiple games on at a time. The atmosphere is pleasant and the energy is great. I really enjoy the fish tacos and I tend to get them all the time. Other friends have had other things that they seemed to enjoy as well. The service was good, I have no complaints. The guys must love going to The Tilted Kilt because of all the pretty ladies working there but my friends and I really enjoyed the view as well ;) those guys in kilts are really easy on the eyes.  But yes I would recommend this place for a locals and visitors for a fun exciting place to check out some sports over a tasty meal."}
{"text":"the blackened fish tacos were AMAZINGLY good! I was very surprised as it is a bar. Really good flavor and good quality fish. Best taco I have had in a while and I live here in phoenix! Service is always good and friendly. Wish they hadn't changed the potato from fresh cut red to potato chips in the Irish nachos however. Will return."}
{"text":"Great service, despite being the only ASU fans on an OU game night. They accommodated our growing party. Food was great, stuck to apps. Our server was fantastic, thanks Gaili! We will be back, since we don't get the PAC12 network at home. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Gross food and horrible service. Patiently awaiting this place to go out of business so something better can take it's place"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin with this place. We did our fantasy football draft here this past weekend and it was absolutely terrible.   We were told we were going to be given a private room along with our own tv hookups. This did not happen, we were placed in the middle of the restaurant and we had a hard time accessing the HDMI hookup on the back of the TV. We nearly had to pull it off the wall just to see the hookup.   To add to the madness I ordered lunch and never received my food. I will never return here and highly advise against planning any type of group events with your guy friends."}
{"text":"I am always craving Shepherds Pie, What is there not to love about ground beef in mashed potatoes, mixed veggies and cheese baked on top. While in Vegas, my wife and I decided to take it easy one day, It was dinner time and I suggested that we go to the Tilted Kilt for dinner. I'm not to sure its a great place just to go for dinner, But if you are into sports that place is AWESOME. The Tilted Kilt ranks #3 out of the top 10 places to dink in Vegas according to the Las Vegas Where Quick Guide. With 30 beers on tap and plenty other in bottles, It also offers a full bar and TV's EVERYWHERE. I almost forgot the about the hottie serves walking around in red plaid mini skirts and a top to match.  Back to dinner, I of coursed ordered the One Shot Johnny Shepherd's Pie. It came out at the right temp, So I didn't burn my mouth. It had the right amount of  of meet, potatoes and veggies inside. Usually the mashed potatoes over power the rest of the ingredients but not in this one. The bread that it came with was perfect. This shepherds pie ranked #2 out of my top 10 shepherd pie.  My wife ordered the Sadie's Stuffed Breast, The chicken breast was nice and moist and had great flavor, It was stuffed with cheddar cheese and bacon. Which added to how awesome it tasted. Such a great taste to your pallet. It also came with steamed broccoli, It was steamed to perfection.  Next time that i'm in Vegas ill more then likely try something else on their menu.  (Wings & Beer)"}
{"text":"Food was great! Wings were outstanding as was the calamari."}
{"text":"Believe it, the food is good. Really good spot for lunch or watching sports. I took my wife on one visit, and she was pleasantly surprised. The staff, not bad either."}
{"text":"Can't say much about the food here because we sat at the table and were completely ignored, despite the fact that there were about 5...'entertainers' standing by the door trying to lure in more pervs.   The whole place had a creepy, desperate vibe to it. Don't bother. If you want to see nude girls, go to a strip bar. If you want to eat, go somewhere where they actually employ wait staff."}
{"text":"I can't say I have anything good to say about this place. Food was awful and service was sub-par. We ordered 4 meals and not one was good. The plates looked dirty. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Love the girls, very friendly and have personalities too. I go there pretty much daily. Main issue is the visits by corporate. When they come they knit pick on things the girls are doing wrong. What they need to worry about is providing good food consistently. Instead they raised prices, made the portions smaller and the food got worse."}
{"text":"Terrible service.    Got there late on a Saturday night, just looking for a place to get a beer.  Half the tables hadn't been cleaned off for new customers, so we finally sat right by the bathrooms.  We sat there for literally 15 minutes before we even had a waitress come over.  We were actually about to leave when she finally moseyed over to us.  It wasn't like the place was busy....so really no excuse.     Beer was ok... But beer is beer, hard to screw up. Waitress had no recommendations.  I guess they figure since they are dressed in lingerie that they don't have to be competent.  This place will be out of business sooner than later if they keep it up.  Pulled out my change to leave the exact amount of the bill when we left.    Simply tuurrible!"}
{"text":"Chill spot to sit and have drinks and watch the game.  Not too crowded.  Friendly bartenders.  Great selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrific service and attitude. These people just hate their lives and job. The manager was rude and distracting to entire party. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I was expecting better service, or at least decent service. The waitress basically ruined the first experience here for my friends and I. We visited on a slow Tuesday evening and the waitress took 15 min. to approach our table and take our orders. In fact, after she took brought our drinks we had to let the hostess know that we had been sitting waiting to order. Even after that, she refilled ONE of my friend's drinks and never checked on us again. She then, took another 20 minutes to take my payment after we were finished dining. Again, we had to let the hostess know that we had been waiting and were ready to pay.  Overall, the food is delicious but the service was truly disappointing."}
{"text":"Server Phoebe was awesome, couldnt ask for a more attentive and friendly server. Burger came not as ordered, onion rings not cooked all the way, food luke warm, coleslaw has no flavor. Not impressed this visit at all."}
{"text":"Recently opened in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  This location is prime for sports fans traveling in town for a game. Here is the bottom line, they pints are pints and the selection is similar to any pub.  The food is pub food and you have to understand that so don't set high expectations.  There are a few irish pubs in the area, I believe I have reviewed them as well, stop by here though if you want a cool place within walking distance from the sports facilities."}
{"text":"Okay so for starters I was going to give this place three stars but then I tried their chicken wings and POW!   Right smack on the Esplanade a popular place for drinking on any day of the week you can usually find something to suit all tastes.  My first impression on entering  The Tilted Kilt is that of being greeting by what I would imagine to be characters from the porn spoof of Braveheart (insert porn spoof title here..........................  I know this place has had a fair amount of stick for only attracting pervy old blokes but that has never been the case, there are just as many average customers.   As someone already said this is not a gastro pub so do not raise your expectations that high, the food is pretty crap with the shrimp basket being one of the worst but just recently when I went me and my friend both shared a double portion of their spiciest wings but ask for grilled not fried.  They were awesome, so much so I would easily come back here just for the wings.  The other plus points are the amount of coverage for sports, you can view a screen from pretty much anywhere in the bar so for sports fans this is a great spot combined with a good selection of beers and good service.  Talking about service it has always been friendly but I also know that if the waitress is being overly friendly and trying to make conversation with your table it is because management makes them do so. Not a big fan of that as I prefer a waitress to do what she needs to do rather than unwillingly flirty with old blokes."}
{"text":"Came in before a game. The hostess was MIA so a waitress seated us.  It wasnt crazy busy, but it was starting to fill up.  Our drinks arrived promptly, but then our waitress virtually disappeared.  Our appetizer took 30 minutes.  Manager delivered the order, stated he took it off the bill, and then immediately ran away before we could reply thank you or say anything.  It was really strange. We took our meals to go since we had to get to the game. I think they need more staff.  But it was close to the Peoria ballpark, so that was a plus I guess."}
{"text":"Apparently they don't have ESPN 2. At a sports bar. I live close and would love to come here more but you're a sports bar. Find/buy the damn channels and/or teach your employees to find the channels. It's not hard. Especially if there's 3 people in the bar(typical for this place unless it's UFC).   Went to zipps (after missing a quarter of the game hoping the waitresses/manager/bus boy/ ANYONE would find ESPN 2), and of course they had the game I wanted on because IT WAS ON ESPN 2. Terrible."}
{"text":"Visited 5/11/13.  Tilted Kilt is a typical bar type restaurant.  They have a nice selection of draft beers.  And typical bar food.  In fact, on this visit, my food was less than quality. I had the open meat loaf sandwich. It was not very filling and I was not impressed with the meat loaf.   It is in a nice location next to both US Airways Arena and Chase Ball Park. Nice location to meet for a quick burger and beer before a game.   My main reason for this review is to compliment the service, or management during this specific day.  And the reason for the fourth star....  With a group of guys for a day at the ball game.  On first round of drinks, waitress spilled beer down my back while serving. She was carrying too much to handle and trying to reach across and set glass down. Lost control of her tray and the result was a beer bath.  Of course I was in my game jersey...  The waitress response was less than quality. After cleaning up the spill and delivering a new beer, her only response was to ask if there was \"anything else I needed.\"  At that point, it was time to talk with the manager...  I wish I could remember the manager name... He told me, but I forgot...  But his response and service was exceptional.  Comp'd my meal and offered to give me a t-shirt from their store. But when he did not have my size, gave me money to by a new t-shirt at the ball park.  Only because of the manager response would I return. If it was left up to the waitress and her response, probably would not be back.."}
{"text":"I was surprised this place wasn't more crowded during a Browns game.  But then again, we were able to get two seats at the bar so I am not going to complain.  I used a Yelp check in offer for a free Irish nachos.  They were pretty damn good, actually.  Fried goodness.  My chili was just okay...wouldn't order it again.  A Guinness was $6.75!!  Their beer prices are outrageous.  Standard chain experience."}
{"text":"Went here on a busy Saturday afternoon.  there were high top tables which you can sit at and have drinks. we were seated immediately and served drinks. the girls that work here are really friendly. they wear a cute outfit. Danielle was our server and she was on top of it. the drinks for cold and refreshing. we also had the garlic fries that was delicious. this pub has a lot of TVs that you can watch many different types of sports going on. come to the kilt if you want to have a fun time then go ride the big Ferris wheel which is outside.  the bathrooms are located upstairs which says lads and lassies so make sure you go in the right one. overall the experience was great come here if you wanna have a great time."}
{"text":"Went again for the 3rd time with my sister and some friends. I like seeing girls as much as the next person. Service was atrocious again. I got the hand breaded boneless wings and the outside breading was soggy, the fries were mediocre and thin and they had a very pompous attitude. The girls just stood and talked for like 2 minutes before asking us anything when we walked in. Hooters is much more welcoming and I prefer their wings. I will make a stand next time anyone wants to drag me to this awful place. All around awful experience. And for the 3rd time I literally cringe when I hear the name of this place. Every experience here has been just horrible. Go anywhere but here!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner after CES Sunday night. I'm from Los Angeles and 2  colleagues from Taiwan. Bar food good. Had the nicest waitress Mary Ann. Great personality and very attentive. I will go back just to be settled in her area."}
{"text":"Unless you know someone,  expect to be ignored.  The girls hang only with thier friends. Food is slow and average at best."}
{"text":"The Tilted Kilt is an oasis in the desert ... a mirage if you will.  Everytime I've been there, I've had a fantastic time.  The food is exceptional, from the chili to the lasagna, and of course their traditional pub fare.  The employee's, guys and gals, are always EXTREMELY attentive, as I've never been left for more than a moment with an empty glass.  If you want to watch sports, eat great food and be attended to by a professional and beautiful serving staff ... You might want to check out the Tilted Kilt."}
{"text":"We went here for a couple beers while in town for a concert. We ordered mozarella sticks and they arrived before we even had our first drink. The service was extremely slow and I don't care for half naked women. Maybe that is just me . . . ."}
{"text":"One of our friends recommended going to this location rather than the Bell location even though it is further away for us all. Now I know why. This location is so much cleaner and far more comfortable. I had the black bean veggie wrap which was delicoius! They had different sports playing on the TVs which I always appreciate. Our server was super friendly - I wish I could smile that much. I was very very pleasantly surprised and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The world renowned Tilted Kilt has arrived in Toronto. After a careful examination of their....ahem 'wares', here is the skinny on Toronto's latest pub.  As far as the establishment goes, be wary, there isn't a significant amount of signage as you walk about The Esplanade to tip you off of their existence (we walked past it twice). Be on the look out for a side hanging sign with little to know wording, just green and yellow with the initials TK.   Once inside, I was impressed. Take your typical grungey dive bar and then have new owners come in and deck it out with more LED/LCD televisions, pull down projection monitors and tech-specks then you could watch in a week. Great coverage if you're looking for a place to watch a game. I was even impressed with the unisex washroom layout which housed individual stalls for both the lads and lassies. Also the crisp LED Television living behind the mirror is high definition and had me stuck watching highlights while I washed up before dinner.  In terms of the staff, I will admit that the advertisements for this place had my expectations a little high, so I was a tad disappointed with the squad here. With the exception of our server who was leagues above the rest. Lesson learned here, the days of the Hooters Girls are long gone. But the guy in me still appreciates a lady who's willing to bear it all while serving me and my pals some beer and grub.  As for the the libations and nutrition. I'd say I really enjoyed their selection of brews, it was extensive and I was happy to see Somersby Cider on tap (Protip: Add a shot of Jack Daniels to a pint of this over ice and it's like Christmas all over again). Much like the bar, the food is typical pub fare, nothing to write home to mamma about, however for my money they pulled together a fairly decent Philadelphia Cheese steak sandwich.   Can't condemn this place to the depths of hell like my two review predecessors already have, if you're looking for gourmet grub then keep on walking folks. But if your looking for a good place where the ladies are scantily clad, serving up pub grub, and booze with a wink and a smile, then come one come all to the Tilted Kilt."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for St Patrick's Day. Not even fully packed and it's by far the worst service I've had in 20 years for any restaurant. Were second in line to get a table and they wiped our name without getting us a table so we had to go up again. After 35 minutes of no one taking our order once we sat, we had to go ask for a waitress. After 15 more minutes we had to ask again. Then our orders were all messed up (there were 5 of us) and two were completely the wrong order. Then we waited 10 minutes to get silverware, after literally asking the waitress 3 times more as our food got cold. Definitely won't be ordering another drink or we'll be here all night waiting.   Oh, and we paid $10 to get in and they haven't even been playing Irish songs. Just one the entire time we've been here. //correction: the two Irish songs were someone hijacking the jukebox. The DJ isn't playing Irish music.   As expected, our checks were all messed up. After sending them back twice for corrections, we finally gave up and will settle the correct amounts once we get home.   Wow."}
{"text":"One of the first places I went to after settling in my hotel room in Phoenix.  Nothing too special about this spot. I think if anything it's really just a random sports bar that people go to to watch games especially since the United Airlines arena is right across the street from here.   Had the boneless BBQ wings which were okay and a Stella beer. Only thing I really took away from this bar is that the waitresses were really F'N hot. Other than that though, nothing to brag about too much. Spacious and cool for large groups but I don't know, didn't really do it for me."}
{"text":"As I had to cover the Jodi Arias trial for the last 4 months I got very accustomed to walking to the kilt for a lunch time beer and some food occasionally. I like the layout and half in half out bar they have with a nice view of the ball park. Every waitress I had was very friendly and always did a good job. I liked their kilt burger so much I never ordered any other item but everyone that I ate with had good things to say about their dishes. They have a beer of the month special and good happy hour. I really like their TK lager beer, very tasty!"}
{"text":"Had a great time! Sat at bar, Brittany the bartender was quick and friendly. Great service. Order 2 bbq pork sliders very good. Cheese sticks were good also.  Grilled wings 1lb great ended up being 8-10...it was a lb alright! Blackened chicken flatbread with fries good meal. Pricing wasn't too bad compared to portion size, similar to Hooters. Will be back!"}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY!! 8 wings for $11. Are you kidding me!!?  What a rip off. Go to ZIPPS near Kierland bigger portions and better service. Thanks no thanks. :-/"}
{"text":"Would really give here 2.5 stars.  Typical pub when it comes to decor and size (lots of wall signage, basic wooden tables, kind of low lighting, a large bar, etc).  When it first opened a few years ago, I found it was busy and hard to get in, at least at night.  Came here on a recent Saturday night in December around 6pm and the place wasn't half full.  The servers are all females that are wearing 'adult' school uniforms (eg plaid mini skirt, white shirt tied up to show the midriff).  So that's their thing and that's fine.  Service is okay.  The food is okay.  I really enjoyed their California burger (but made with their black bean patty instead, as I'm vegetarian).  My partner really enjoyed their wings but found them pricey at $2/each.  Their shepherd's pie is apparently very salty, almost too much so, according to a friend.  Their bacon cheeseburger is good, according to another friend, but he had to eat it with a fork and knife because the bun wasn't strong enough to hold together what's inside.  They ran out of sweet potato fries and pinot grigio the night that we were there.  Another in our party agreed to switch her order to regular fries instead, but the plate of those came out by itself, ahead of all of our other meals.  She didn't want to start eating it without us having our food, so the server took it back and brought fresh ones out again when we were all served together.  The bathrooms are individual private stalls with co-ed sinks outside them.  Overall, nothing terrible, but nothing great here.  I'm not dying to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"This place does not even deserve 1 star. Just left there and we are eating at another restaurant because of the worst service received here. My husband and I heard of Tilted Kilt and wanted to like coming here. We were greeted by one of the servers a few minutes upon arrival. It was slow there so there was no reason to have to wait long enough to acknowledge us. We were seated and told that another server would take care of us. We waited about 20 minutes without any service. They did not even ask what drinks we would like to get served while we looked at the menus. However, different servers were going to a table with 3 men who were being served. One of the servers was folding silverware inside the cloth napkins. And when we left the server folding silverware said goodbye. We let her know that we received no service. Either way no one said anything when they saw us walk out. Now I understand why the place was not packed like you would expect on a Saturday night. Service is awful!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time since the Grand Opening in February while meeting an old college friend (Arizona State, Go Devils!).  Outside looks great.  Plenty of parking spaces with bright lighting all around, easy access from SR-51 and Paradise Valley Mall.  Spaces inside is huge, small fountain fireplace on the outside patio on the west side of the property.  Lots of TV's in and around the bar area, plenty of seating places.  The only down side is that there's only one pool table, which was on the corner area of the bar, not impressed with that since the lighting was low.  Didn't order any food, the beer selections were great.  Always ask the waitress on what's good since they have beer of the month choices.  Beer came out fast from the tap and the glasses were always cold, making the beer taste much much better.  Will definitely come back again to enjoy the great view."}
{"text":"Awesome food at the Tilted Kilt. Yes, the waitresses have the little outfits, but they do a great job too. Plenty of tvs to watch the games and unlike other sports bars, this place turns the audio on."}
{"text":"Walked was not greeted. Waitresses are pretty but have horrible personalities. When we requested drinks we had told them we have never been there and bartender didnt even bother to give us a heads up on what they have on tap. Last time we went, it wasnt too busy yet bartender was too busy talking to his buddies to serve us drinks let alone ask us if we are ready to order. Food was good so the one star goes to that."}
{"text":"This is a very fun place to relax with good food, good drinks, and good people.  Prices weren't too bad.  Service was great.  There are TVs everywhere so you can enjoy any game you want to watch.  There was also live music on the patio, which was a very nice touch.  I only wish they had reverse happy hour on the weekends, but let's be honest ... that might be a tad greedy.  :-)"}
{"text":"We just wanted food!  A fight was on and we were told they were understaffed so the host wouldn't give us a time and wouldn't even let us sit on the EMPTY patio - I asked. I'd have been fine ordering inside and serving ourselves sitting outside but we weren't given any options.  It seems like a poor business choice to not only show a fight on a FRIDAY, St Patrick's Day weekend, knowing people will stay for hours, but not schedule staffing so the patio can be utilized by patrons...I thought this was RESTAURANT?!? There also isn't ANYWHERE to sit inside while waiting for a table or waiting for a to-go order.  Super bummed because I've always wanted to try this place but I'm not going to beg for a seat and a menu if they don't want my patronage."}
{"text":"Overpriced and service is so so haven't gone to PV location for 2yrs. Just saw it was being torn down hope they put in a good place like a strip club...."}
{"text":"Can I just say that when I walked in out of the 101 degree heat looking for an ice cold beer I was pleasantly surprised!!! This is a excellent pub, bar, loaded with amazing looking women servers. Their outfits blew my mind! Absolutely gorgeous. The beer is great during happy hour and the food was excellent.  Thanks for a great afternoon."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since I heard its another version of hooters and my area doesn't have one nearby.  It was very crowded when we got in but the atmosphere was pretty nice.  We had to wait for a table to be open but while we waited we were able to go to the bar and order a few drinks until our table was available.  The \"view\" left me taken aback at first with all the girls in open blouses and short kilts but once I got used to it as a guy it was pretty nice.  The service was pretty good, and the menu was small but the options on it weren't too bad.    I enjoyed myself and I wouldn't mind going back again and trying out the other things they have on the menu.........plus the \"view\" was pretty nice."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  3 of us girls who are all in the industry decided to go have a few drinks and snacks and ended up walking out empty handed. The ladies at the hostess table were very nice and told us where we could sit.  We chose a spot looking out into the shopping area.  After patiently waiting for about 15 minutes without ANY service, we asked the bartender what was going on and he informed us that nobody serves that General area (thanks ladies for the heads up)  He showed us where we could sit to receive service and we even talked to a waitress who saw where we were sitting and STILL another 10-15 minutes, NO service.  Being a local and a server, I understand if it's a packed house for service to be slower than usual, but we weren't even acknowledged and there were plenty of staff standing around. Super disappointed because I've been wanting to check this place out. Definitely won't come back. Too many other options available in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with my brother for a quick bite to eat.  We just had hamburgers and fries.  The food was good.  The patty looked like it was formed by hand and pressed.  The French fries were really good too.  I will come back to this location.  I want to try the Shepard's pie next time."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up a friend who works in a law firm at Cityscape. Since we were already here we figured we might as well do dinner here where we more or less know what to expect as opposed to random concert venue fare at the location we were headed to. Megan was our witty server and I really appreciated her sense of humor considering these types of places usually hire servers for their looks even if they have as much wit as a box of rocks/bag of hammers or the personality of a doorknob. Megan was headline level talent and kept us entertained even when our food and drinks weren't matching her own delivery. She gave us the right amount of attention that we didn't even care or bother to time who got what when. Just like Mad Magazine she had snappy answers to stupid questions and if I can actually laugh out loud rather than fake a forced laugh at something a server says then this place at least made one good hire. I had the Samuel Adams Octoberfest - she recommended it and we all ended up getting it - no complaints about that. I ordered the Shepherds Pie. It was ok - edible but not especially memorable as I've had much better elsewhere. Really it was Megan that made the night here memorable more than the food or drink. Is that the way things should be? Hard to say because it doesn't happen too often. If you park in the cityscape parking structure Tilted Kilt will validate. Plenty of parking in the Cityscape parking lot - more so the later you come."}
{"text":"An A.D.D. sports fan's dream! We were in Scottsdale for the weekend and wanted to watch the UFC event and have drinks and food.......we ended up here!  The waitresses appear to be Hooters' girls prior to enhancement. Cute outfits and pretty gals.  The service was a tad slow but the waitress was working her butt off, as it was busy due to it being an Oklahoma game and this being the local alums hangout. There were screens all around, friendly people, good atmosphere. The food was what prevented a higher rating. It was \"okay\" and that is typical for a bar. All in all, a fun place to go, though!"}
{"text":"Wings were great for a late night bite to eat, but the service was horrible. Considering that it wasn't really busy being a late Thursday night. I might go back during the day to give it one more chance."}
{"text":"Best fish n chips I have found since coming to the US from England the home of fish and chips!  Great servers and atmosphere, recommend it highly."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit. Lots of TVs with lots of sports. Nice, and yes, very cute waitresses. And good food and beer at a reasonable price. Hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Not a bad visit. I regularly visit the Location in Columbus, OH. I have developed a certain expectation as to the type of service that should be implemented in this concept. Compared to Hooters, this place will eventually put Hooters out of business. The food is consistent and delicious. I am a huge fan of the shepherds pie  and Quinlans 5 cheese pizza. The service at this particular Location was a few notches below the service provided at the Scottsdale and Columbus Locations. The servers seemed under trained in how to communicate with the guests. That preferred to fraternize amongst themselves which was the only fault that was noticed. The place was clean, restrooms well maintained, and the food was expeditiously served. Prices are a little high but who are we kidding, commodities are up everywhere. I will always stop by when passing this concept. Compared to it's competition of sports bars it is among the top of the list."}
{"text":"Went in fairly close to closing time, kitchen was closing. Manager offered to keep kitchen open if we wanted to order. We only had a couple of rounds of drinks but service was still good."}
{"text":"I just ate the fish and chips and I would say the BEST in the Scottsdale or N. Phoenix area. The service was great and the food came out in no time.. I will be back and will tell all my friends and family to check out the best place for \" Fish & Chips\" in town."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of eating here occasionally with my AO brethren and have always had a great time. Never once have I had a problem with service, drinks or food. Since I came here a bunch of times for the World Cup I was able to try different items on the menu every time and loved them all especially the burgers and garlic fries. Add a pint of Kiltlifter and I'm one happy camper. Thank you to the staff and Toby for always taking care of me and the group. Great time here always!"}
{"text":"Delivery from here was super fast and friendly. The food was on point and plentiful. There will be some salad and wrap left for lunch tomorrow. Would have liked to try it in person, but maybe next time!"}
{"text":"First time going to tilted kilt. I saw it on TV and had to try it while I'm in town. Not a place to take your kids for sure. Nice sport bar to watch the baseball game and get something to drink and eat. Waitress are nice. I ordered the sirloin steak salad and 1lbs of wings. I was disappointed in the salad because the steak was dry and very little meat but the lemon pepper wings are not bad."}
{"text":"I just stopped in for a beer, so I can't comment on the food.  Its on the same line as a Hooters.  Some busty, scantily clad females that go over the top to pay you attention.  Strip club vibe, without the negative social stigma.  My beer was cold, my server was friendly, just not really my type of thing.  If you are a little older man, that want's some attention from young females, go for it."}
{"text":"Average food with good beer selection.  Terrible service in ok setting with higher costs push it below average.  BBQ across the LINQ was twice the overall."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both came in late one night for some apps. He got the chips, salsa and guacamole and I got the sampler appetizer with fried pickles, mozzarella sticks, boneless wings and pretzel wii cheese sauce. The food was great, I got the hottest sauce for my boneless wings and it was really tasty. The fried pickles were crisp and the guacamole was very flavorful. The prices are good especially for being on the strip in the linq promenade. The atmosphere was fun and the views of the promenade were nice. The guy manager working 04/11/17 (because I can't remember his name) was super cool! He was more than accommodating and very personable! The servers outfits are cute. Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"fun place to go after the Suns game. Service is good, girls are cute and friendly..food is alright"}
{"text":"I was suprised the food was waaaay better than you would expect for this type of bar....I liked the outdoor patio area, fun crowd"}
{"text":"So I took some out of town friends here for Super Bowl.  We had a great time, the wings were pretty spicy, I definitely do recommend them!  I had the BBQ Burger, it was good, nothing overly exciting.  I do have to say the service was great, yes the outfits are tailored to the sports bar crowd, but the waitress was very prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"Video is awesome!  Food, not so much.  Was a convenient stop before a concert at Comerica.  Service was good, not great.  HINT: you need to take the escalator to enter.  The restaurant is not related."}
{"text":"After a couple of visits here, I have resolved never to have plastic surgery and to remain a healthy eater.  These girls show a LOT and the guys really dig it.  I just don't think I would be comfortable with all that close-up leering.    Oh well, the review is for the food, beer, and service.  They have a great tap selection, decent bar food, and fabulous customer service!    The one thing I truly don't like is that sitting on the inside side of the bar, I am still subjected to mega-smoke and cold from the smoker's patio that has the flaps down for cold weather.  I don't know how I was ever able to stand going to bars before indoor smoking bans, and this is a great reminder of how icky they were."}
{"text":"I'm not overly impressed with this particular location as the talent is rather lacking here, especially considering what Tilted Kilt as a whole is accustomed to hiring!  The wings taste good but are extremely over priced.  A friend and myself had 2 beers a piece and two orders of wings which maybe had 6-7 wings per order, tab was $42.50.  I was like damn that's just wrong for 4 beers and a bakers dozen of wings!  Waitress was extremely shy and lacked confidence.  Happy hour is your best bet.  This Particular location just seems very lackluster!  I hope it was just the timing.  Doubtful that I'll return based on what I stated in this review!  Too many better options!"}
{"text":"I walked in and asked what time they stopped serving food and the hostess rolled her eyes at me and laughed. Not sure what her problem was but I will never step foot in there. Terrible."}
{"text":"Good place to come with friends and hang out. food came out hot. and was pretty decent. service was good. plenty to tv's to watch the game on. only issue is if sitting at the bar. the table behind is close and people moving in between there keep hitting your chair. otherwise decent place to catch the game."}
{"text":"been to tilted kilt twice but probably will never go back again even though i only live a mile away. the first time i went i actually did not know anything about it i just happend to be driving by and never been so i wanted to try it. so needless to say i was a bit surprised and happy when i saw the waitresses. but lets be real here. its no different then hooters, great atmosphere and crappy food. you are not going there for the sub par irish food. if your going for a beer with some of the guys then its a good place to go but the food is just not good and no where near fresh and authentic. the atmosphere is pretty good though. even though the girls are not half clothed i would much rather go to molly mcphersons, ri ra's or connolly's."}
{"text":"Usually good service but not very good service this eve. Server was good in the beginning. Then she came over and said she was transferring out and hinted if we wanted to pay the bill. We just sat down and started watching the game so it was a bit awkward. So we decided to go ahead and pay. a mistake. As soon as we did, we got no more service from that server or any other. We waited a long time to get our drinks refilled and nobody cleared out our finished items. No other server came by. And we closed out as a favor to her. unfortunately I will come back because they have better TVs than any other place. I would have given 1 star for this experience, but the other times I've been here, I got good service. Plus i had a little time to reflect. Still a good place to watch games because they have better tvs than other sports bars. Buffalo wild wings may comes close. So I gave two more. Food is ok."}
{"text":"Maybe our experience was a one off but my husband and I both got sick within an hr of eating. He had the steak and I had the meatloaf sandwich. We both had the garlic mashed potatoes. Both tasted fine but I was projectile vomiting for an hr and my husband spent the night in the bathroom. We are on vacation here so a night wasted being so sick really sucked. We had our food delivered to our hotel so I can't comment other than to say it was super fast."}
{"text":"This review is mainly based on the service and a cool manager that took care of us there. Food is your typical sports bar/ chain type but was pretty good. Wait staff was very attentive, got our order right and food out fast, always there refilling our water and kept the beer coming. They even had some girls giving out free shots of a new Irish Whiskey!! What put it over the top was that we were visiting for the weekend and wanted to find somewhere to watch our New Mexico Lobos play for the conference championship. Despite the fact U of A was playing at the same time and they were getting ready for a UFC that night the manager on duty set us up with a section with the Lobo game on and kept it on for us until the very end. MUCH appreciated, that's the kind of service that goes a long way!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here before the Foo Fighters last night, the place was crowed and not staffed at all, I was waiting at the bar for 20mins and the bartender never came to our side. This place can't handle big events downtown, Stay Away...."}
{"text":"GREAT BAR!  This is the best Tilted Kilt location in AZ.  Good food and drinks  Tolerable atmosphere =)  Andrew has been my go-to bartender at this location for years. provides excellent service and phenomenal drinks!   ASK FOR ANDREW."}
{"text":"I've been to this and other Tilted Kilt locations in the past; this review is based on a very recent visit to this location in Scottsdale.  Stopped in here while staying in a nearby hotel, to get some dinner and watch some football.  The place itself is fairly decent, and in a good location.  Lots of parking, although I walked over.  Typical sports-bar feel, looks like this place has been partied hard in a few times.  Nice patio area, with a bar that wraps around both indoors and out on the patio.    The beer and drinks are all standard, and this is a decent place to have a beer and watch a game.  The bartender was very good the night I went; she kept a good eye on all her patrons and I never had to wait to catch her attention.  And yes all the servers are young attractive women in small uniforms.  Basically TK is like a Hooters with a Scottish pub vibe.  There are also plenty of TV's around so you can watch the games no mater where you are sitting.  So why only 2 stars?  Mainly due to the food.  It wasn't bad, but everything just tasted like packaged food.  The salad was fresh, but the dressing and croutons were like the cheaper brands in any chain grocery store.  Wings and fries were okay, but I've had much much better at plenty of other sports bars.  I'd probably go back again if I stayed in the same hotel again, because the Tilted Kilt is close, convenient, and at least a good place to have a beer and watch a game.  But maybe next time I'll grab dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Just mediocre at best. Drinks just don't do any excitement for me. $8 bloody Mary was served in a small glass and watered down. Sausage and meatball appetizer was cold, cheese wasn't even melted and was very soupy. Water glass was so filthy that I did not dare drink from it. Service was OK. ...and thus the 2 stars.  Update: Last night I was sick to my stomach and I ate nothing after this meal."}
{"text":"Hooters in tartan...worst pub easily. Portions were meager, food quality marginal, service was clueless. Just walk on by.  if it's only for beer and a ball game...maybe."}
{"text":"Great place!  terrific happy hour.  My favorite server is Sasha!  Shes a riot and not your typical BREASTrant server.  The kilt is leaps and bounds ahead of hooters in attractiveness, beer selection and food."}
{"text":"GREAT SERVICE/GOOD VIEW (kno Wut I'm sayin ;)) friendly staff, good food, good service, split cheeks (I mean checks), bday desert. I mean, could this guy ask for more?! Heck nah!"}
{"text":"Below par food and drinks. The only positive to this place is that the service is fast.  You would be better of visiting other places around the area."}
{"text":"At long last the tilted kilt has moved its plaid patterns and busty servers to the GTA. It's been a long awaited coming and upon arrival this evening it appears that it was well worth the wait.   The space is massive, way more seating than the smaller Toronto location, a bar that stretches from one end to the other and more high definition television screens than you can watch at one time!  I was thrilled to see that their on tap selection exceeds the regular big 3 Canadian breweries and offers a line up which includes: stiegel, delerium, Guinness, and erginder! Well done!   The music is blasting as I sit here and the energy in here is absolutely electric.   Oh... And the venue, it's an old boston pizza and looks NOTHING like it, both in the decor and.... Well the staff.   If you recall reading my review of the Toronto location you'll remember that I was less than impressed with the \"selection.\" In this instance folks, the burbs does it better! A+  The only thing IMO that keeps TK Richmond hill from receiving a 5th star at this point is that given the late hour that I'm here I'm not able to try their food (something I plan to remedy in the near future).   Welcome to Richmond Hill TK, and thank YOU for coming..... No seriously - thank you so damn much  Removing my jaw from the floor - Eatcrest Out......."}
{"text":"Mediocre bar food, mediocre beer selection. But the kicker is this: $8 draft beers. SERIOUSLY. $8. In PHOENIX.  Even assuming I wanted to see them (I am a straight female) TITS are NOT worth $8 beers- especially with a plethora of options in the area with $5-$6 drafts. This is Phoenix, NOT Manhattan on a Saturday night.   OH, and by the way, I got the monthly special beer (Sam Seasonal) which was .50 cheaper than normal. So apparently my beer is normally $8.50.   NEVER AGAIN. TOTAL RIP OFF."}
{"text":"If you like half naked, drop dead gorgeous waitresses and alcohol, you should have no problem enjoying a night here.   If good service and 5 star food is more your speed, travel elsewhere.   Sure, you might get the wrong bill brought to your table, twice, and maybe the drinks are inconsistent and the food sub par, but let's face it. You shouldn't be coming here for much more. The beer is cold and the women are beautiful and really, everything else you can get somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is a nice place if you don't care about money. A miller lite was 8.00 and a shot was 9.00. Be ready to empty you wallet at this place. And the only restroom is upstairs!"}
{"text":"Bad service and mediocre food on opening day.  US locations are much better so it may improve.  Food really needed work though."}
{"text":"Wondering if anyone else here had a very nasty experience with Nick, the general manager.  My idea of a general manager is that their goal is customer care and service above all else. I was honestly (and I am not being dramatic here) appalled at how I was treated by this General Manager. Verbally disrespected is a good way of putting it.   I wanted to pull up an open table on the patio next to a friends' table as more folks were coming. The waitress, extremely kind and helpful (here name was Elizabeth or Libby), said she had to check at the hostess stand and asked me to come with her. I agreed as she was so sweet, I wanted to do what I could to make things easier for her. Upon our arrival at the hostess stand, where the GM was standing, she explained the situation. He immediately barked something at her about having \"no idea what she was talking about\" (Which made sense as he barely listened to her before he cut her off) and to take him out there and show him. We go back out to the patio, and I promptly explain I just want to take the open table next to my friends' table and sit next to them. I say I don't even need to push the tables together.  Nick, the GM, then says \"You can have a chair.\" I instantly think he's being sarcastic as not only is that table wide open, there are--NO LIE--more than a dozen open tables on the patio. It was 90+ degrees outside so no one wanted to be seated out there. Thinking he's joking I respond something like \"Oh, just a chair? I can't have the table?\" and he goes \"NO and if you keep talking to me like that (Mind you, I do not speak disrespectfully to people so I have no idea what set him off), you're not even going to get a chair.\" At this point, I realize he is NOT kidding and I say \"But you have all these open tables out here\" and he responds \"I have over a 40 minute wait, you're not on that list\" and I say \"But what about all these open tables?!\" to which he says \"you can forget that chair\" and storms off.  Not only did I leave immediately, my friends who were already sitting and eating were so disgusted by how he (a man) treated me (a woman) that they promptly paid their bill and left.  As long as he is working here, I won't be making any visits. I've also contacted corporate."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: SUCKS. Everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING is sticky. The floors are sticky (the bathroom floors are stickier). The tables are sticky. The whole place is just absolute crap. It really takes away from the beautiful girls working the place. If they could go in and really do a deep cleaning with a tanker truck of pine sol, it might get three stars."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Drunken clams were good with beer. Fish and chips were smoking hot. Guacamole was chunky and tasty. Find came in less than 5 minutes after ordering."}
{"text":"This place is close to an area I pass by frequently and when I saw the signs go up that they are opening soon I said to myself ah well another pub just what this neighborhood needs. Little did I know that they are popular for the same reasons that another chain whose name rhymes with shooter is known for. I was here for a UFC event which was preceded by a  Maple Leafs loss (surprise surprise). The place was packed so I would recommend making a reservation if you are a larger group. Luckily as the hockey game ended a lot of people were leaving the bar so I managed to snag a spot. The setup is nice for a sports bar with HDTVs everywhere along with 2 Video Wall Systems and a projector. As for the other other attraction they are definitely better than the competition so if that's your thing I would recommend a visit.  The food is your typical pub fare so I decided to stick with a burger and a substitute of sweet potato fries. Beer selection is average with some Belgian mainstream offerings.  The service was slammed and slow, I had to ask for my drink a couple of times and while I was taking the pic of my food the server told me I should ask her before taking her pic!!  I guess the servers are used to being leered at and think everyone who comes here is the same reason so give her a pass for thinking  that.  As for the food hmm some of the fries were cold!  The burger was actually decent with an over sized patties, cooked through.  Food wise nothing to write home about here folks. I would give 2 stars for that , the setup is nice for a sports bar and no cover for UFC makes it a reasonable option to watch the pugilistic  sport.  2.5 Stars overall."}
{"text":"Okay scenery. Good beer, not much local. I did expect a little more from this place in terms of friendliness. I obviously came to drink a beer and stare at some nice things but the waitresses and bartenders here don't really know how to entertain. A nice body only gets you so far if you can't make conversation with your clients."}
{"text":"was here drank 2 beers and ate fried calamry, wings, and fried shrimp - all delicious"}
{"text":"It's ten minutes until kickoff for the Steelers playoff game, bar is stacked 4 deep, and there is ONE bartender! The staff's response was that they did not anticipate a crowd - WTF?!?"}
{"text":"I came here bc I know a girl that works here, so I stopped in before going to the Casino.   And that's why this place is busy, if the Casino wasn't there they'd be out of business.  Took awhile to get a table, the way they have the sections for servers is weird. I'm in the restaurant business so I noticed this. Each server has like 2-3tables. Eye candy I'm sure.  It's kinda like a trashy hooters. But that's cool I just want beer and decent food.  The food was overly greasy and sloppy. Too much sauce on things and all the fries were over cooked but cold.    Also for an establishment that has the girls dress like that..I felt as a woman I wasn't wanted there, which is strange, usually bars want ladies hanging around. It was like I was invisible all the attention was on the men I was with, even when trying to get a drink she'd forget me or flat out ignore me."}
{"text":"I had only been here once before and that was for a friend's birthday, where only beer was consumed. Today, we went for dinner and...well, I have a few pros and cons, despite my four stars.  Pros:  It was actually really delicious. I had the club wrap and Justin had a burger, both of which were pretty great. We also had an appetizer of mozzarella sticks which tasted great, and not too salty or anything.   Service was kind, helpful, and very quick. Apparently my boyfriend already knew our waitress, as she frequents his work.  Music wasn't too loud, the lighting was just right, and everyone seemed happy.  Cons:  It was...WAY more expensive than I thought. Our tab came out to $50, not including tip. I'm not saying the food wasn't worth it, but I can get the same quality somewhere cheaper.  I know that the dress code for the servers is aimed toward men and ultimately probably gets these nice girls very good tips but I really felt uncomfortable with the amount of boob showing and how short the skirts are. Maybe I'm jealous that I'm not that skinny or whatever but...eh. I don't know.   If you go in for dinner at five, and don't want to sit at the bar, don't expect to get any service until five thirty. It isn't posted anywhere, but the only person who will be there is a bartender. I did not know this so I sat around like an idiot.  I burned my mouth. Not a con against the place at all but owwwww...  All in all, I will probably go back. The food was really good. I don't have too many complaints. I wish there was less boob but hey, what can you do. It's not the 1800s anymore."}
{"text":"A great experience! I have a gluten allergy and they don't have a gluten free menu. The chef came over and worked with my allergies to create a delicious, safe to eat meal. Best service ever! Thank you"}
{"text":"It's ok as a novelty the service isn't bad but it isn't great and it was dead inside when we showed up. The server was nice had no idea what beers were on tap, and she paid absolutely no attention to my wife to the point she barely took her order. The food is average. I order the BBQ bacon cheese burger it was ok but dry. My wife ordered the shrimp basket it was over cooked. We don't regret coming but we sure will not be back. It is also not cheap"}
{"text":"I went to the Tilted Kilt for the first time and it was just as the soccer game was starting.  So when I said that I need a table for 2. the ladie said it was going to be a few minutes for a table to open up. Then a guy (I think Manager) came and told me that they would not have a open table for about 90 minutes. That is a huge difference from a few minutes.  they don't have any seating outside.  After that experience I am never going to go back to the Tilted Kilt. I am even thinking of writing to the company about the Un-Customer Service. By the way this was on 4th of July."}
{"text":"An okay place all around. Decent selection of beer, very busy, and - of course - cute servers. The food is also okay, but nothing exceptional. I don't mind going here to meet friends, but not my first choice overall."}
{"text":"Horrible bartender I came in Thursday night and this asain  girl was our bartender she ignored us the whole time and was rude pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Well I live down the street from this place. And I hate coming to it. First reason; drink specials. Or may I say the lack there of. For women they have some pretty good specials but for us men I think this place figures since all the servers are in school girl outfits they are doing us a favor. Honestly I careless about the servers and what they wear. It's no strip club. I come there for one reason only, a beer. And when it's over priced it's not worth it. The food at this joint is also crappy, only the french fries are ok. I recommend going to Salty Senoritas if your looking for a good bar  & food and atmosphere right down the street."}
{"text":"The food had a funny taste. I think it was the tomatoes and lettuce. Also it seemed like our waitress was trying to get rid of us because she kept asking us if we were ready for our check every time a Seahawks fan walked in. I guess our table was meant for them to watch the game? Food gave me a migraine."}
{"text":"Food was okay. However, the service was horrible. Different server brought our food. Also, never showed up to ask about refills. She was only concerned with her table full of men.   I never leave less than a 20-25% tip. Service was so bad we left a less than deserving 15%!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch by myself one afternoon after a business function.  have never been to a Tilted Kilt before.  Sat at the bar, had a sandwich and a couple beers.  Service was outstanding, food was outstanding, reasonable prices and needless to say the women that work there are beautiful.  Great atmosphere, tons of televisions and just a generally nice crowd."}
{"text":"Service is very slow.  Have been sitting at a table for 10 mins and still waiting for any attention for the servers.  After twenty minutes we left.  There was a pirate game that night BUT still could even put a drink order in."}
{"text":"Good was meh- bland nachos & veggie burger. Try the Bloody Mary!! It was nice & spicy. Our server was ok, she took a while to get to us (the place was pretty slow) but she greeted us with a smile! I could see other customers being very frustrated with slow service."}
{"text":"Went to the Tilted Kilt during my visit to Vegas and was more than happy with the customer service I received. The food was great, plenty of tv's to watch, the drinks were amazing and the staff was beyond welcoming. I will definitely be back. #cheersandbeers!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Two stars is actually generous in my opinion. I had dinner and a few beers with a couple of friends on a Friday night. The evening started off poorly and ended the same way.  As we walk in, a staff member is standing at the door so I ask him for a table for three. He tells me to go talk to one of the girls, Ok, I guess he's too busy standing there doing nothing. We are told there are no tables available. Ok... so we ask how long the wait will be and quickly told they say they have no idea. As we stand there deciding if we should leave, we are told a table is now available. Staff were clearly confused.  Previous reviews hinted at a good beer selection. I ask if there is a beer menu but nothing is available. I asked what was on tap and told there are over 30 beers available. That's great but when I ask our server for a couple of suggestions she offers none. Why have an extensive beer selection if no one knows what is available. I don't get it. After an awkward extended conversation, I find out they have Erdinger so I go with that. To my surprise, it was served in the correct glass.   We started with the Chicken wings appetizer. We all found the wings kind of  salty. I had the club sandwich. It's served with fries that I'm sure were frozen. The club sandwich was average at best and the chicken very dry.  My friends had the burgers and neither finished them, they were too salty. Only highlight was the burger bun - it appeared to be home made.     The restaurant itself looks great with lot's of big screen TV's -  great for sporting events. Cool unisex washroom with a mirror /  TV above the sink. I will not specifically comment on the servers but agree with the comments of previous reviewers.  I will not be back. There are two many options on this little street to settle for the Kilt.  BK"}
{"text":"Really liked this place near the Linq. I went there to watch a Monday night football game and eat. Great food and lots of tvs. Very trendy. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place has bad service, lazy waitresses and a negative staff! Do no come here for \"happy\" hour!"}
{"text":"First of all, our waitress was GREAT. She needs to find a job somewhere else though because this place is horrible. The bartender took 15 mins to pour an Angry Orchard and a Coors.  2 people sitting at her bar. I usually get the same thing here. This time I got the SADIE STUFFED BREAST. absolutely disgusting. The sauce was soooooo salty it was not edible  The broccoli was hard. The stuffed part, was not stuffed at all. It was all dried out and empty. Gross. My son had the ribs, so burnt on 1 side he couldn't even eat the bottom. I sent my food back and got the fish and chips. Which I've eaten plenty of times before. They brought out fish and fries. The fish batter was so soggy. Just nasty. I picked it all off. And my daughter had the salad with the steak on it. An hour later she was vomiting.  I will NEVER ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Best experience I've ever had. A manager came out and offered us a special gin, the bean patty was amazing, and our girl was very sweet. I recently became a vegetarian and my options are usually little at a place like this, BUT my burger was so good, it made the carnivore I'm dining with wish he had gotten what I got."}
{"text":"If you're downtown and looking for lunch while on break from jury duty, than this is a great place to spend your hour. I had the Big Arse Burger with a side salad. A standard burger and fry-combo, but it's the views that make it worth the stop. You can see Talking Stick Arena from the main dining room area... All and all, you get what you expect from a chain restaurant: good atmosphere, good food, cold beer, and great service! There are many reasons why I'll be back here and one of which is that I need a calendar for 2017."}
{"text":"Really good food but super slow service.   Takes way too long for them to come and even bring u a drink or tea to start with.    It's just too slow of service.  The girls primp more than they focus on good service.   Like I said I love the food.  But will get it to GO FROM now on."}
{"text":"Too expensive,and all dudes at the bar.its very close to the house and it has a pool table,or i wouldnt go back."}
{"text":"They have a new menu according to the website, but the food was a mixed bag on our recent visit. At least we saved money by using the coupon deal on Yelp which got us $25 worth of food for just $15. Also, on Sunday they had a great deal which was 16oz Bud Light draft for 2 bucks and $4 Bloody Mary's. The food prices are pretty high, but quality did not come through on my $11 chicken tender wrap. The tenders were poor quality and the fillings of dark green lettuce and some salsa were pathetic to say the least. Better luck was had with the blackened chicken pasta which had  anot spicy jalapeno cream sauce clinging to the twirls of noodles. Looks like, it's beer and appetizers for this chain in the future for me."}
{"text":"This is basically a Scottish-themed Hooters. The waitresses wear tiny kilts and pretty much display their entire breasts, which makes for an awkward eating experience. It's one thing to have pretty waitresses in tight black dresses, but this is really in poor taste.   It's quite a small restaurant, and the seating is very cramped. The food was decent -- I had the southwest chicken salad -- and there are a respectable number of beers on tap, as you would expect on the Esplanade -- but it's nothing to write home about.  The service was also helpful, so I'll give this place two stars, but there are better options on the Esplanade."}
{"text":"Been here twice already. Very friendly staff, Patio set up is great, inside is 'eehh.' Food portions are more \"European\" (smaller in size) but very tasty! Drink specials are good, beer selection is nice as well."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Tilted Kilt in Pheonix many times and loved the food and atmosphere. Have walked past here over the last commenting we should try them here...so we walked in...( I was lured by the $7 Moscow Mule monday special).  I ordered the \"Ultimate Grilled Cheese\". ( My inner child was in great anticipation of bread overflowing with the cheeses as described in the menu) so disappointed. Seriously, not even 2 full slices of cheese on whole sandwich. The bread was good. My husband had an \"ok\" hamburger. His tutor tots were beyond cold. ( to my husbands dismay, I tattled...and they brought us some hot ones....which were good.) We sat at bar, the bartender was very nice. Overall, quite unhappy with our experience."}
{"text":"Wow, what to say about this place.  First and foremost, it's basically just a bar that serves bar food.  It's decent bar food and the menu is much more robust than your typical bar, but they present it as such.  If you're into sports there are plenty of TVs to catch any number of games ....  In a nutshell, this place reminded me of TGI Fridays with a Scottish theme, and waitresses wearing slutty little Scottish schoolgirl uniforms.  Don't get me wrong, as a guy it definitely caused me to accidentally stab my cheek with a fork a few times, spill my beer in my lap, and proved to my wife that even though I'm a pretty decent guy .... I'm still a male ...... and anything else I say about this is going to make me look like a middle aged pervert .... Ok place, decent food.  Nothing spectacular.  The uniforms need toned down a bit though.  You can still sell sexuality, you just need to be a little classier than that."}
{"text":"Went to Tilted kilt to grab some quick dinner and obviously observe the atmosphere.  Food was average, I had the wings and fried pickles.  Wings were pretty dry and seemed like the frozen food isle wings from the grocery store but had decent flavor.  The pickle chips were good and they currently serve San tan epicenter amber draft which is an excellent beer.  Although the food was a little below average the atmosphere is good.  Ladies working there seem happy and were polite and friendly.  The gentlemen also were very polite and friendly which made the visit relaxing.  If you're looking for a good place for food, the kilt is hit or miss.  If you're looking for a place to drink, see some pretty ladies and watch some sports, the kilt fits the bill.  Not my favorite place but it worked for me and I was satisfied with my visit."}
{"text":"We went in twice last week while in town and bothered times had excellent service at the bar. The 1st night the kitchen had stopped serving food but there was live music and he was great! Our next visit we tried the giant bar pretzel and wings and they were both great and served hot.   Bartenders each visit were outstanding!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for horrible service and crappy attitude from the staff then look no further! Sit down like you're transparent, order drinks and wait for 20 min....fries took 1.5 hours after 4 reminders! But other than that..."}
{"text":"Went in with two of my guy friends on Saturday and they wanted to watch football.  This place was packed and the atmosphere was really fun.  The food was exceptional; much better than I expected.  Our server, I think her name was Amanda, was amazing.  She was totally attentive to us and was really engaging.  We ordered the Tilted Kilt wings and they were some of the best wings I've ever had.  We ended up staying for dinner and my friend had a Black-n-Blu cheeseburger that was enormous and cooked to perfection and he could barely finish it.  My other friend had the fish-n-chips and they were fantastic.  I tried the southwest chicken salad and it was a little spicy, but I really enjoyed it  We continued drinking the cold beers and we met the manager Brian who was really friendly.  He made us feel very welcomed and we will definitely be going back.  I would personally recommend this to any of my friends as a place to meet up and spend a fun day."}
{"text":"I like this place, they have 3 projection TV's and I always find a decent place to sit. Order the Fish Taco's, they're Great!"}
{"text":"The food is fair but overpriced. Alot of intoxicated girls who should have been cut off swearing at other tables and the staff doing nothing about it as they look on. Trashy compared to the Scottsdale Kilt, skip the Peoria location and drive to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE EVER! Been there with a private party and smaller groups. It wasn't a fluke-the manager either short staffs or the waitresses we got were inattentive to such a degree we had to order from the bar before service came. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere.  Kendra is a fantastic waitress. She has a great personality and is always on top of your order."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went in on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm. We walked in and got sat at a table right away. Awesome.  Our server came up to us and introduced herself and went to get our drinks. She brought them and took our food order. Our food took a while to get there. The actual food was great! I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and it had a lot of flavor to them. The fries were good, too.   Our server kind of went missing, though. She wasn't around a lot and she didn't really check on us.  I would say it was a neat first experience and probably my last. There was nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"The bartenders were good, but most of the waitresses just stood around a table talking to each other."}
{"text":"Don't take reservations. Asked for a table inside, was given an outside table and told we would get one inside as soon as one opens up. It's been 2 hours and its 50 degrees! Just a terrible establishment and the service is even worse"}
{"text":"We visited here three time during our twelve days in the area.  A good test of a place is how well the food and service holds up during a crunch. We came in to watch the football play-offs and the place was howling.  Caught the last table to watch the second game (got lucky there) Had some appetizers and cheese steak, fries and a mess of tea and Chardonnay.  Food all tasty, hot, cheesy, melty good. Glasses always full. Wait staff all uniformly cheerful and constantly moving, despite the crunch of mostly hammered football fans. We need one of these in Washington."}
{"text":"First time I had ever been to a Tilted Kilt.  Only went because that's where friend wanted to go.  I wouldn't have known that one was in town had it not been for him - did not notice anywhere on LVB that clearly let you know what is in The Linq.    Anyway, it is just a typical bar serving typical pub food.  Food was not bad, just nothing to write home about.  BF got the Boston Burger, asked for MR got MW to W.  He said the taste was good though.  I got the Irish Dip (French Dip) which tasted just like a French Dip I could order anywhere.  We did get the pretzels, which were good - soft and not too much salt, but the cheese dip left a lot to be desired.   With my water and his lemonade, the total bill tip and all was $50.  I can't imagine what it would be if we had ordered drinks.  I agree with what others say in that, yes, drink prices on the Strip are typically higher, but these were way out of line with the norm.  We probably won't go back, as it isn't worth dealing with the Strip crowds to go."}
{"text":"I love Irish and Scottish Bars. Places like the Caledonian, Mcveights, Dora Keoghs; where the atmosphere is as close as you will find to those places without forking out the $1000 plane ticket.   Titled Kilt is not one of those places. Instead its a cruel inversion of hundreds of years of drinking culture. When you are confronted with practically topless ladies in super short kilts its just kinda meh. Not really erotic, just kinda in your face. My poor Scottish gran would be rolling over in her grave.   The worst kind of North American Excess put on top of a real culture. As an old Irish Man once told me. \"THERES NO SEX in  IRISH MUSIC\"... The same goes for pubs."}
{"text":"went here to watch some football.... terrible experience the TV on the wall is 4 different colors... there are never any drink specials as we were told by our server... the food looked like it was just thrown on the plate... the place was.out dated and the only thing that looked good was the girls... over all terrible pre drink location better off saving some money and going next door to scottland yard"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there tonight after the Diamondbacks game. The place was packed but we still received amazing service and the food was awesome! We had Taylor as our waitress and she did an outstanding job- especially considering how busy it was. We got the Irish nachos (for free thanks to this app) and then I got wings with mashed potatoes and my husband had a burger.... We were more than pleased!"}
{"text":"Decent food here but come on, is it really the food you come here for? I like coming here when I have my irish cravings and need a good ol glass of guiness."}
{"text":"Came here for our Chapman Univ. reunion. We had a large party of 30 people over 6-7 tables. Staff and servers were very accommodating and service oriented. Typical pub food fro garlic fries, calamari, quesadilla, buffalo wings, burgers, variety of salads - nice beer on taps, wine and cocktail menu. Sports fans will be happy here as they have a number of large flat screens with plenty of sports playing. Located by the Linq/boardwalk of shops and restaurants. Plenty of parking, but crowded parking spots and difficult to find spaces during dinner and later in the night."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday with an equally conservative female co-worker after deciding we were getting tired of our stand-by lunch places, so we decided to throw caution to the wind and try the Tilted Kilt.      We were initially put off by the mere  thought of a Tilted Kilt taking up a building that had previously been Fuddruckers (loved) and Barrio Cafe (eh).   We were keeping our fingers crossed for something good to go in, since the Tilted Kilt has a reputation of being a \"Hooters\" type place, which I avoid like the plague.   Now, I am a curvy plus size (& perfectly fabulous, thank you very much) woman, so chomping on a hamburger with size double-0 servers running around is not usually my idea of fun, but I have to tell you, I REALLY liked this place!  I love the Irish-style  based menu, which has some traditional Irish fare, with some excellent and different bar & grill type food.   I ordered the spicy sausage sandwich and a size salad and my co-worker had a steak sandwich.   Mine was EXCELLENT!   The sausage was just spicy enough and grilled to perfection with melted provolone cheese and grilled onions (ordered without peppers).   It was a nice generous size portion, both the salad and the sandwich were so large that I couldn't finish it all.    The decor is fun and interesting... Tons of TV's with sports channels going.  Great fun, warm, & welcoming environment!    Best of all, the service was fantastic.  Our little tiny size double-0 server was cute-as-a-button and was engaging and delightful enough that I didn't even notice (or care) that her entire uniform wouldn't fit on my left breast.     I am  happy to say that we are definitely adding Tilted Kilt to our regular lunch rotation!   Welcome to the PV area T.K.!   I'll be seeing you soon!"}
{"text":"If I Could rate a zero I would. So disappointed went out with friends who have never gone out in the NS and was hoping to Show them a good time. They were not busy at all yet each order of beer took 20 minutes and burgers 1 hour and 15 minutes. Food came out late and wrongly cooked. After some food was comped bill still came out to $100 For Two couples With one person not drinking! Will never go back again."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say how much I love eating here, this is my best friend's favorite place to eat. We went here for her birthday last night, and the servers really made it a great night. Our waitress was able to have the kitchen make my wings gluten free, and words can't describe how happy that made me. They brought my best friend a birthday shot that was so sweet, and they helped us sing happy birthday, turned up some birthday songs, and the DJ played a couple of our requests. Great place to go if you want some where fun to spend time with your friends/ family, eat some not-so-healthy, but delicious food, and listen to good music in a chill environment."}
{"text":"Not Good......  I have eaten at many of the \"Hooters\" type of spinoff restaurants. This was my first time at Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery. The ambiance was okay however the service here is horrible. The servers \"Kilt Girls\" would congregate around the reception desk, and look board, instead of \"up-selling\" or even just coming by the table and ask if we are okay. I did notice smiles when our server came to our table, however when our \"Kilt Girl\" and other servers left their table, it turned into grins, and bared the look of a un-enthused employee. We had to flag down our waitress several times, she forgot things we had asked for and was incredibly slow. The entire waitstaff seemed lethargic and unenthusiastic about their product and atmosphere. The servers represent the product and should be part of the product they are creating. Places like \"Hooters\" are well trained and confident and energized about their product, along with representation, presentation and theme. The hard critique just comes from over 35 yrs in the entertainment, & service industry...which is a hard thing to sell. This brand is a nice concept and looks nice, and albeit may be okay with the regulars, however with a seasoned service veteran I can see the flaws in this model. It could use improvement  in several phases. I believe the staff could utilize a great deal of re-training with an emphasis on customers service and pride in their brand.  Conclusion;  I will not go back, and will visit elsewhere for a \"view\" and a brew, I left this place feeling heavy, and let down as a customer..."}
{"text":"Not only are the staff members hospitable but the manager Ivory provided exceptional customer service! Another patron and I were there for about four hours having cocktails and he purchased us a round lof drinks for being there for so long! As a local nobody has ever done this for me!!!"}
{"text":"My date said the place smelled like onions when we walked inside. It did a bit, but it eventually faded away. The date got some four cheese flatbread pizza which looked decent and my flatbread blackened chicken sandwich was actually pretty tasty. It had some orange sauce (chipotle?) that really upgraded the level of taste. The fries were hot and firm, not like my 50 year old date's body, but can't win them all. The bud light was 3 bucks and reverse happy hour was kicking off at 9pm which meant cheaper beer and food specials. The bartendress was attractive and we both could not help but to stare. A good location for this chain and not too crowded due to the family area it is located."}
{"text":"Arrived around 6pm on a Saturday and the place was very crowded.  We waited about 25 minutes to get seated.   We were seated at table that resembled a kind of \"two sided bar\".  I was really hoping for private table and sitting with a bunch of strangers didn't really appeal to me or my guest.  Our server, Becky, was very friendly and attentive.  Yelp had a check-in deal going on for free Irish Nacho which saved us $6.99.  We gave the nachos a try but found them really greasy.  I had the Kilt sandwich was a basic heated club sandwich and fries. The sandwich would have been better had the turkey not been burnt on the one side.  (It was hard to see because the lighting was low but the taste certainly was there.)  It was very loud and I had a hard time hearing my guest.  (I had measured a 100db on my iPhone app although it usually stayed around 96db.)  Bottom line is the service was good but the food and atmosphere was not."}
{"text":"Over priced,  Over hyped restaurant. .. nothing to write home about. Stick with Twin peaks."}
{"text":"I went there once and their food was outstanding! By far the best Shepherds Pie I have had in Phoenix, and I have tried a more than a few Irish places around here. Their fish 'n chips are also quite good, in the top 25% of places around. It is definitely a sports bar, with many large tv's all around. So far it is a good place to eat. Next time I will check out the drinks."}
{"text":"We went here last weekend after an even in AZ. There was a HUGE group of us, we took up two rows of tables.   The atmosphere was good, prices are affordable and even with a group as big as our, we had excellent service up until the end.   The food was tasty, I ordered the cheese steak, a friend of ours had the classic nachos with chicken and beef. Both were good. The tea was a bit.... bland? I only had a taste, as it was my husband's drink. It left much to be desired.   At the end of the meal, we were the last to be given our tabs and the server never came back to take the payment. We waited for about 10 minutes while our groups was dispersing. Wouldn't have been such a big deal if we didn't have to follow some of them to get home. When I approached our server to offer my card, it was as though I was interrupting her for no reason... then she remembered she hadn't collected our payment. I was tempted to walk out, but couldn't do that to the poor girl. I know what it's like to be busy, but there could have been more attention to detail here.   I would go back, for sure, though. It was a good place."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good deals and food and great service.  Don't mind the girls in the crop tops and short kilts even - if you're going to let me order off a happy hour menu with items under $5, you can wear whatever you want!  I'll be back for a late night snack when I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix one night for a DBacks game and stopped here for dinner. Many tvs with many different games on throughout which was much appreciated. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was actually quite delicious. Very juicy and tender and the flavor was great. Service wasn't amazing or anything, but acceptable. I recommend stopping here for a bite if you're headed to a DBacks or Suns game. Great location."}
{"text":"Tried something new and was very pleased!    The my wife ordered the grill chicken salad and I ordered the chicken sandwich.  Overall our meals came out great and exactly what we ordered.  What I liked about this place was it had a nice mean, lots of options that wasn't so overwhelming, and specials.    We thought the price was great, they even honor most discount programs if you qualify.  And did I mention they seem to have specials from time to time.  So great value and its worth it for what you get.    Its kind of a sportsy-bar type place but without the bar.  I like that for the fact that you could  bring family if a sport fanatic dad really wanted to see his game, but spend time with the family at the same time!  lol  The customer service was great.  All the way from our server to the manager, they really seem to make it a priority here!   This I located in Peoria in or near the Arrowhead Shopping Center.  Parking should be no problem.  Overall, I really like this place.  Wasn't expecting much and never heard of this place prior, but would go back again and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"It was a Friday night in January 2014 and we had company in from Chicago. Decided to go there because always had good experiences back in St. Louis. This was NOT the case here. I was so embarrassed by the horrible service and food, mix up of food and total chaos. We had been talking this place up to our guest and then this happened. It took a good 30 minutes from the time we were seated till the time we were asked if we wanted drinks...AFTER I had to walk to the bar and ask the bartender if anyone was going to wait on us. We had 4 people in our party. Nearby to our table, was a group of middle aged men flirting furiously with the young waitress. She must have been promised good tips or something because as it turned out, she was supposed to be our waitress! She apparently enjoyed that table so much that after she finally came by, she apologized because she didn't see us while we sat there for 30 minutes!  DUH? She had to walk around our table to keep bringing the drinks to the table for the obnoxious men. They were loud and rude and were even downgrading to the waitress, who was too young and naive to even realize. I looked at those men and just shook my head like you've got to be kidding!  The bartender gave us a free round of drinks which was nice and we appreciated that.  Our waitress not only messed up our simple orders once, but twice! It was a total mess. The hamburger had to be sent back twice as it was nearly raw. There was not enough orders of garlic fries. It was obvious to me and those in my party  there was no manager anywhere on duty. The only person that looked like she was actually working was the bartender and she was running all over.   From our table, I could see through the door to where the kitchen was. It appeared to be a small get together of employees goofing off. If there was a manager there, that  would have never happened.   We even watched the CBS show, Undercover Boss when they covered the Tilted Kilt. If the CEO ever saw this kind of nonsense going on, they all would have been fired immediately.   If you want to be waited on and taken care of, DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"We went last night for a friend's birthday.  They were overstaffed and very friendly, which I think is fantastic for a new place.  Everyone seemed to be having a good time.  They don't have happy hour yet, but are planning to soon, once they get more familiar with the new location.  The atmosphere was fun and loud.  Lots of girls in small clothing running around tables full of mostly business men with a few ladies sprinkled in.    We had a few appetizers (irish nachos, wings, and garlic fries).  Nothing blew me away . . . correction, the food didn't blow me away, but it was fine.  While this might not be MY first choice when looking for happy hour after work, I look forward to when TK gets a good happy hour so that when my (male) friend gets to choose the HH destination, I know I will still have a great time!"}
{"text":"I liked the alternatives you could make to the burgers, like getting a black bean burger and and protein style with no bun. Our waitress Barby was great!!"}
{"text":"Went here off happy hour on a Saturday to watch some sports and grab dinner.    Food:  I tried the roasted garlic fries, which were amazing, and the flat bread which was okay.  The food prices were really reasonable and I can't wait to have the fries again.  Definitely something you will not want to eat if you're looking to pick someone up.  Staff:  I sat at the bar the bartender was friendly.  There were a lot of older guys around (50+ in terms of age), and you could tell that it was a hooters like setup where they'd hit on the skimpy outfitted waitress (which hey no complaints about that) and she'd play along.  I saw a comment about the girls gossiping and sitting around.  There was a table where all the waitresses were together, but this was due to it not being busy and a was also setup to greet anyone who walked in.  Prices  Food prices were reasonable, but beer was real pricey.  $6.75 for a 32oz miler light seems kind of ridiculous.  Yes it is off happy hour, but come on.    Overall:  I sat at the bar so I could watch the Olympics.  There were plenty of different tv's with all different sports which was great.  I also hope to sit outside next time since it seemed like a cool setup.  As I said food was good, waitresses nice to look at, and all in all a nice experience."}
{"text":"Now this chain is offering a free burger of your choice (about $11 value) when you sign up for the birthday club. At this Kilt location, it is usually crowded and everybody knows the bartenders. Finally found a bar spot (after an old lady spilled a glass of ice) and ordered just a basic cheeseburger with salt/pepper fries. First off, those fries are too seasoned, so stick with the normal fries. My burger wasn't cooked properly, but they got it right the second time and it turned into a decent, average burger, but well worth the price of free. Happy Hour goes through 7pm and the large domestic beers are only $4. Of course, the women here get graded also and they will get four stars for both looks and service."}
{"text":"Awful experience, came in with a couple of friends, food is mediocre at best and well overpriced.  Drinks are also well overpriced and bar staff are apparently only interested in getting phone numbers.  Waiting an unreasonable amount of time for both food and drink, paying way too much considering the quality or lack there of, add into that the non existent service is why ladies and gents I will not be returning to this establishment nor will I endorse them."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Wings were just okay. WARNING watch out for the bartenders writing in/changing tips on your receipts....Didn't notice on my account until a week later, but the bartender took it upon herself to write in a $3 tip on my receipt. I keep my receipts and usually leave a $ in the tip spot(meaning I left cash as tip)  but I can't believe some bartender was so damn greedy she needed to write in a 3 tip on my receipt which easily changed the total from 11 to 14. Smart. Wonder how many times this b!tch has gotten away with that trick. Name on ticket was MARCI, but I don't remember if that was the actual bartenders name.  Will not ever be back!!"}
{"text":"I have to say, the fact that my table is the only one with females is kinda creepy. This is your typical \"hire women on looks and not serving skills\" kind of place, but I keep coming back.  Most of the menu is typical American chain food, but I keep getting cravings for their steak salad. The grilled onions with the steak make it amazing.  The actual service is hit or miss. There is one server, Megan, who quickly learned that my friend and I were here for that one dish and that we are working, so hurry it up. Seriously, she is amazing with that. We haven't had a good experience with any other server."}
{"text":"I visited the Tilted Kilt. America and the USA and Titties. I don't question the order. I visited a similar place on a sweltering summer afternoon in Dallas years ago called Twin Peaks. I didn't worry about the brilliant television reference. I did not argue with the order. Seriously plaid and tits and I do not question the order. I lift my forearm to grapple my serving I am met with a big smile and brisk thumbing of areolas. I don't feel the need to express didactic measures. I want to hug young girls and not worry about my buddies. Stars are irrelevant in this category yet I will award two enthusiastic approvals."}
{"text":"Nice views, plenty of tvs, and you can get your beer to go."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  Being a new place at The Linq - trying to get tourists and locals in, you would think this place would be jamming.  Very empty.  Girls are just okay - Sorry, Twin Peaks girls are way more friendly and (I'm a happily married gal) and hotter!  Tilted girls were super young - there for a paycheck and could care less about who you were.   Food:  Chicken tender wrap w/fries - regular bar food - nothing special.  Same with the burgers.  I had the chicken tenders with fries and got broken up pieces of chicken - not even full, long, big tenders - plate looked like a child's portion.  Very disappointing.  Drinks - someone had a Moscow mule said it was okay.  Beers are beers, I had a simple vodka and club soda - think it was just soda.  Seriously - you are on the strip, make a decent drink.  Atmosphere - music way to loud for eating - you are screaming at each other.  The bar seemed hopping so maybe just sit there next time - but pass on getting a table and eating there.  So not worth the money."}
{"text":"Any bar that lets children of this age, come into it while people are drinking this much alcohol, should be shut down. What looser would bring elementary aged boys into a bar? I get it....the women are half dressed; no different than if they were at the beach. I came here to watch a fight, loosen up, and relax. I would never have had several drinks if I had known children were going to sit behind me. I had a designated driver but I didn't have a designated babysitter. FU Tilted Kilt!! This is the last time we drop 60 bucks at your establishment."}
{"text":"Headed in last night and as a bonus we had received a coupon in the mail for a buy one entree get one free. Waitress was nice. Food was good. Beers were cold. We had a great seat watching the UFC fights. 5 stars."}
{"text":"ashlee-a is very rude. first of all, when i called to put in my order she had an attitude when asking her to elaborate on what she was asking, as if i was bothering her. so when i arrived to pay and pickup my order,  she swiped my card wihtout telling me the total and charged me for the wrong order.   when she realized she had charged me for the wrong order she called for a manager. upon the managers arrival she too had an attitude and did not make eye contact or acknowledge me at all!!! she then proceeded to try to resolve the issue. while doing so the guest behind me made a comment and the manager got defensive and said a remark that was not necessary nor appreciated.  this is my second time dealing with ashlee-a and still do not appreciate her service towards guest nor did i appreciate not recieving an apology or explanation for her mistake. the manager was also unapologetic and rude.  tilted kilt overall has great food and a really fun enviornment. the younger lady that worked there made the situation better with her energy and great smile, but ashlee-a and the manager need to take some classes on customer service and deliver it with a smile and passion, if not than find another job where you dont have to deal with people."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is great. Tons of TVs with the best sports and almost as good is the killer patio. Nothing better than when the bar is completely open to the outside patio overlooking downtown. Great views outside and inside. I hate to post this because I don't like sharing! Don't miss out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Although the waitresses are beautiful they made me feel super not welcomed when I came in the restaurant on me own (one woman) but I'm in town for business so no choice.  Good coleslaw. Good fries. Ordered chicken sandwich but chicken was almost burnt and tasted chared. I'm in town for 4 more weeks not sure if I'll return."}
{"text":"We've been her numerous times with so so service, but football was available and comfortable to watch. However... our most recent experience included a spider which must have fallen from the ceiling outside in to our food. Luckily it landed in a dipping sauce rather than running around our table. Our waitress said \"ew\" and then asked if we wanted to box the remainder of our plate instead of empathizing and offering some sort of consolation for our meal being ruined. The unfortunate side of all of this is that customer service is lacking in this establishment and makes it difficult to enjoy your time spent. Not a go to from here on out. Also, don't expect welcoming service from the bartender who only caters to older gentleman... point taken!"}
{"text":"Wish I had watched more football here.  The food was meh - lots of burgers & kinda bland pub food. However, there are TVs everywhere and they do specials during the games for opportunities to win coupons, goodies, etc."}
{"text":"Not the best wings, but great boneless wings and beer selection. Really any of the crew, will take care great care of you, but Danni was on point so I had to give her a shout out. Ask for her and tip her well please.  Oh yeah, guys your guy friends will probably be more comfortable than your girlfriend given the short kilts and all...fyi."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to go somewhere that would fulfill the different needs we had on this specific night. I needed food, while he just ate and wanted a beer. Our minds went to a bar, but where to go? Ended up coming to the East Beaver Creek area, and ended up in front of the tilted kilt.  Pretty quiet as we came on a Sunday night, but the staff were very friendly. A cool setup with a unique bar side and lots of different televisions set up. The sound system was broadcasting according to one of the screens, but it was definitely too loud. It may have been where we were specifically seated, but it was hard to carry a conversation between us.   I ended up getting Chicken Tenders, and it was quite good. Nice and saucy, which great fries and coleslaw on the side! Came with 5 pieces as well, which is a plus as most place only give you 3 or 4.   Service was quite good, but they had limited staff on a Sunday night. Our server was also the hostess, so we didn't get much attention to our table. Was okay though as we would just wave her over.   A nice spot with lots of seating. Definitely nice to have something a little more on the traditional bar side, rather than the club-vibe that the area already has."}
{"text":"I have to say this was one of the better experiences at tilted kilt. Went here to see game 1 of the finals and the experience was pretty good.   The waitresses were quite attractive and definitely we're not shy strutting out their stuff. Though our waitress was a bit slow in response during the game, she did check up on us quite frequently once we got our food. The staff here is pleasant and definitely worth the visit.  The food was surprisingly tasty. I had the Cajun fries during happy hour and for the price it was fairly tasty.  There were also a number of vegetarian options including a spicy bean patty for those burger fans.  Beer selection I felt was limited for being a pub - but honestly guys are we really there for the beer? ;)  Overall a good experience at the kilt. Thank you to all the ladies at the kilt for making this a worthy experience! Look forward to coming back here again. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok to me. Nothing specail. It seems a bit like a HOOTER want to be joint just in an Irish theme.   Came to watch the games. There was plenty of tv's which where nice."}
{"text":"Wandered in here on a cross country road trip from California to Florida. The bartender Teague is so friendly and welcoming. I felt right at home. I was impressed with the way he handled the crowd on a busy day, the Cavaliers had just played. He made sure to address everyone that came up to the bar and served us all quickly with a smile. He introduced me to a beer I had never tried before and it has a place on my favorites list now. Highly recommend checking this place out! Thanks Teague!"}
{"text":"Must try the Oyster appetizer it is great!! Nice servers, fast service, and they keep coming by to ask if everything is okay or if you need anything else."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner. Hardly anyone in there on a Thursday. Service was so slow. Nice enough people, but over the 2 hours we were there for dinner, we were offered 1 drink. I finally  had to go to the bar to buy a $12 beer. Food was good enough, but again, took forever."}
{"text":"Aside from the C list view the pub fried burger is plain, I get more flavor out of a McDouble. Fries cold and the best thing is they have an open kitchen so you can see you food sitting in the window as it gets cold and multiple people walk by it then when some one does realize it sitting there it's get taken on a tour of the resturans and it's patrons( waiter/ food runner walked to every table with my food(6 tables total) finally getting to me at the bar........."}
{"text":"Will never ever got to this place again! Those girls the way they are dressed is begging for tips. Waited 20+min for a service. Finally got to .order than waited another 10 minutes to get our beers. They never came so we just walked out. We decided  to go to marjele's  instead way better service n bar tender is hotter n has more self respect"}
{"text":"We stopped by here after a concert across the street. We were in the mood to drink and eat bar food. Luckily we got there quickly and did not have to wait. Our waitress was quick and accommodating as our party quickly grew to more than expected.  We had been here once before a few years back and my husband and I both agreed that the service and the food was better this time.  The beer was cold, the food was great. This is a good spot to continue a good time after special events in the area."}
{"text":"As a frequent patron of Tilted Kilts all over the country, I'm sad to say this location is my least favorite.  I've been to TKs in 7 different states, and unfortunately both of my visits to Charlotte led to disappointment.  I went once after the lunch rush, and once late afternoon.  Both times the place was nearly empty, yet both times I received unpleasant service.  My servers were very abrupt, and I would go for long stretches of time without a refill or table visit.  I noticed some of the other girls who seemed to be much more engaging or welcoming with their patrons.  In my visits, neither server ever smiled.  I always make it to be a point to be as polite and pleasant as possible- I know the kinds of idiots that can make a server's day miserable, so I try extra hard to be a gentleman in hopes of making that server's day a little better (and to reduce likeliness of spit in my food).  But for whatever reason, I ended up with the ladies who already had bad days.  I even leave generous tips, upwards of 30% or more.  When I told one server she could keep the change (I gave her a $20 bill for a $10 meal), she just looked at the tab and said, \"Oh\". And walked off.  The second visit at least she said \"have a nice day\"!  In regards to the food, it tastes as good as in every other TK.  The restaurant had the same standards of decor and cleanliness as the rest of the chain, and the servers for the most part had the same overall \"looks\", which of course is why everyone eats there.  I have to admit, I was disappointed coming here. You go into a TK looking to have great food served by great company, and for me, half of that winning formula was missing. This is the first TK I've been to that I can't give a great rating to. I'm sure others have had a great experience here, but I can't base my opinion on how good a time I perceive others to be having."}
{"text":"I don't mind spotty service when a place is crowded- but then you are the only table in a section there is no excuse why I need to get my own plates and napkins.  Food was not special- nothing good to say here."}
{"text":"Whee!  Beer and cleavage, both in great plentitude!  Okay, so this is one of those chains (ala Hooters) that is aimed squarely at the demographic who wants to go to a nudie bar, but is timid about being seen going in or out of such a place.  Pluses? They have a huge variety of beers on tap, including some relatively seldom seen microbrews.  The waitresses are, indeed, very pretty (every last one of them) and they make every effort to keep the customers happy.  Why only four stars?  The food.  A better meal can be had in the same price range at any Tipsy McStagger's type establishment of your choice e.g. Applebees, Chili's etc. Even so, bike night at the TK is a lot of fun.  Their bike nights are consistently among the best in the area.  Get a seat on the patio.  Have a pretty girl bring you a beer.  Laugh at the flatulent old men as they roll up on their flatulent old Harleys and have fun!"}
{"text":"I remember the last time I came here about three years ago, and the staff acted like they had bamboo shafts through their heads and they were lazy besides. The food was terrible, the service worse and all together a memorably god awful experience. I made the mistake of going back.   I went in and stood for five minutes while the usual crop of pot bellied drunks stared at me slouched in their booths and chairs. A number of servers, who were nice looking in a cheap shoddy kind of way, saw me and looked away. I finally went up to the barmaid and asked her if it was free night since they weren't taking anyone's money, and clearly no one was working.  she said she hadn't seen me and to sit anywhere I want to. That was a lie, she looked over at me two or three times while I was standing staring aimlessly into space at the hostess station.   So I went to find a table. It was great. I had my choice of poorly placed regular tables or dirty booths. I got tired of wandering around the visibly filthy establishment. Finally the barmaid snagged another rude insolent chippie who again told me I could sit anywhere I wanted. I asked her which dirty booth she would like me to sit in because I couldn't decide between the one that had food stuck to the table or the one that had glassware piled one piece on top of another. She at that point became just as surly as the lazy little barmaid. Time to leave.   Those insolent clowns in Tempe that own the place are so impressed with their money and their D cups that they could give a rats patootie about customer service.   Last time I try to give my money to these idiots. The most hilarious part of it is that us folks over 50 have all the money in this country. I'm just as happy to go over to Twin Peaks to spend mine."}
{"text":"Had Hailey & her trainee. Very attentive without being intrusive. Had time to kill so had appetizer, burger AND dessert. ALL PERFECT!!! And very tasty. Very professional, very punctual, very polite. Service is everything.  The trainers for this location have upped the TK game; the employees are truly professional, bright and service oriented.  Corporate. Looks like you're doing more than staring into space.  Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night, too crowded, had to place our orders at the bar for food because no one was serving us. Food wasn't anything special.  Loved that they had kona big wave on tap, didn't love that I had to wait for the bartender to not be busy to put in an order, but he was very kind and helpful."}
{"text":"Natasha was great as always love coming in when she is here she always takes care of me and I will always come back as long as she is here"}
{"text":"There are no reservations. So we came in with 14 SALESPEOPLE, we have month end bonus checks to burn. We ASKED, how long it would be. \"30 min\". 45 min. later...we asked the bald manager MATT how much longer. His answer? \"I dont know maybe another 45, or a couple of hours.\" If you couldnt seat us, then TELL us that. U ruined our night. We went to Tukee's down the road. Our tab is over a $1000 and the fight hasnt even started yet. Oh yea, and the girls are much hotter. Im very confused how this man got his job but well NEVER come back again. Please use your paychecks for some more training. Disgraceful."}
{"text":"Stopped in to quell my poutine craving while giving my husband a place to catch the first quarter of the Buffalo Bills season opener so he'd not have anxiety over what happened until  he got back to his dvr in NYS. I loved it immediately. The waitress that opened the door and sat us was genuine and funny. Our gravy, cheese curd, chicken over french fried heaven came quickly and ranks highly on my poutine scale (Yeah, I've got one). I had an Irish something or other (awesome drink, bad memory) and he had the Canadian beer that is hard to find in Canada (why is that, anyway?). We were out by half time and back for him to watch the second quarter where we were staying."}
{"text":"Okay food and drinks, a tad overpriced but the service was lacking so bad - my friend ordered a drink before any others but got hers 10 min after everyone else and another friend ordered food and it never came and the server didn't notice... Don't attempt asking the servers about the menu or the specials as they have no idea"}
{"text":"Wish I could review the food...but I never got as far as a menu. Place was not busy, sat at the bar, girl walked past me several times...never so much as asked if I needed to be waited on.  In fact I was the only guy on that whole side of the bar, on the corner. I was wearing a bright orange T-shirt, so Stevie Wonder  could see me.  Apparently the hot guy on the other side of the bar was more worthy of attention, because as I got up and left she was back on the other side chatting it up with him , leaning over the bar.  If I could give zero stars I would. Clueless help."}
{"text":"When you install the Scrooge McDuck pool of coins that are all dipped in your delicious buffalo sauce I will upgrade this review to 5 Stars. Still-so much fun!  Otherwise I can't wait to check this place out for the first time. Excited."}
{"text":"Would you like some boobs with that?  Hey, it's like Hooters only with kilts! Seriously, this place is just the pits when it comes to the food. You walk in and you're instantly greeted by gals who look like they've done time in the local strip clubs. It's not sexy. It's not titillating. It just seems unnecessary. I'm no prude, and I love boobies as much as anyone else, but here it just seems tacky (and I'm no fan of Hooters, either).  But that seems to be what the Tilted Kilt is pushing above all else. Girls first, food and service secondly. The day I went the service was lousy. Our waitress would disappear for long stretches, causing the couple who were seated at the table next to mine to just get up and leave before their orders were even taken. I got the feeling that if you weren't buying beers or other booze, then you sort of got ignored.  The food isn't anything that you haven't had at a place like Applebee's or Friday's. They try to throw in a few Irish-based things like Irish stew and Shepherd's pie, and a non-traditional \"Irish nachos,\" but mainly it's burgers, wings, and that sort of thing. BBQ sandwiches and pizzas. Not really the escape from basic bar food one might expect. I couldn't finish my bland \"Big Arse\" burger and took the rest home, only to toss it into the trash later on because I couldn't be bothered to feign excitement over unexciting food.  So here's the thing: If you want to go to a truly great Irish restaurant/pub in the area, head to the South Side and check out The Claddagh. The food comes first. The waitresses? They're there to do their job and not just be milling about up front chit-chatting and looking like Girls Gone Wild rejects.   If you do seek both pretty girls dressed in ye olde attire as well as great food, then I would also suggest the Hofbrauhaus, also over in the South Side Works. They have great German food, terrific beer, pretty gals, and all the great oompah music you can handle. The Tilted Kit is best left to those who truly don't care about wasting money on a subpar dining experience featuring overpriced, bland bar food."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place from a friend. He apparently had visited their Baltimore(?) location a while back and had a pretty decent time. Recently, I took him out here while he was down visiting, with a couple other in-town friends, and I just didn't see the appeal.   Not to say that there wasn't anything I enjoyed about this location near the state line, but it was simply a little too redneck for me. I had a very different set of expectations for this place. My friends Baltimore \"elaboration\" didn't help matters either.   The food was mediocre and beer specials weren't that great. Although it was a Saturday, mind-you. Also could've done without the $5 cover for the fight shown.   Although the waitresses weren't what you would expect from an \"Irish Hooters\", our waitress was very friendly and knowledgable on the menu, which I could appreciate.   I'll stick with my generic Hooter's, or Bikini's."}
{"text":"I'm new to this area.  i probably should've researched this place before stopping in for lunch on a whim.  I understand Taverns and sports bar environments, but THIS...i wish my daughter would come home with a uniform from this clown ass establishment.  We'd be showing up for her first shift together.  As a parent I don't get it.  These young ladies are waitresses, not strippers.  And the ladies are young.    We walked in and probably should've left but stayed.  The service is ok, and the hamburgers we ordered were also alright.  College football games were on, and this seems to be the place to go for that.  The prices were a bit high for what was served as well."}
{"text":"The food was great, server was great, the problem was we purchased a group on the cost $24. We didn't realize it was for 4 ppl. The waitress told us we can probably get some sort of discount just not the full discount and got the manager who was rude placed full blame on us and didn't offer ANY  discount. He said \"I can give you cash value or you can save it for later\". R experience was great up until that point. He could have split the coupon and we would have used the other 1/2 next time but now, we will not be back. That guy needs to take a class or 2!"}
{"text":"A group of us went to the Tilted Kilt on the 21 st of December. The service along with the beer was good. I tried ordering a wrap but they were out of them . I then decided on a grilled chicken with salad. I found the grilled chicken a little on the dry side and the house salad rather bland."}
{"text":"Very similar to our Tilted Kilt in Columbus. The food was good, and the drinks were cold. It was overall a good visit.  The waitress was very nice a friendly, even though I was given a hard time for ordering a salad with my burger. I sure (or hope) she was just having fun with me.   I might return if in the area aagin."}
{"text":"Boo!  Saddest service I've had in years.  Took an hour to get our food.  Kids mac n cheese was a bowl of melted cheese mixed with sauce.  Super gross.  I can't make my kid eat that. I sent it back for a kids hamburger, specifically no cheese and 45 minutes later we got a cheeseburger. My 7 year olds food took AN HOUR AND 45 MINUTES after we  arrived.  Her Lemonade took 1 hour after 3 requests for her drink.   I asked the server if the kids meal came with a drink or any sides, she said yeah, like brocolli or fries.  So I ordered fries.  Then I was charged for a side basket of fries along with the 2 kids meals of mac n gross cheese soup and the messed up burger.....as she dropped the check and said she removed the mac n cheese.  Ha.  Also asked if they had bangers and mash and she shook her head no and acted as she had no idea what that was.  This is a Irish pub and they don't serve sausage and potatoes. I wont even get into how many times my friends at another table checks were wrong or how many messed up items they had.  We waited for our second round of drinks for 25 minutes.  Discouraged we asked our friends at another table and they had the same lame service.  They were also given our round of drinks (the huge and complicated 2 drinks we ordered AGAIN) and sent them back unknowing they were ours and they weren't theirs.  Hot mess.  We also saw sides on their burger entree(tater tots) that was never offered to us.  It was Horrible! Under staffed and under experienced waitress.  Won't be back.  Sorry TK.  I'm pretty easy going but this service ruined our evening.  I can't actually spend money here after an experience like that."}
{"text":"There is a certain reality to these types of restaurants, which is that if a) the service is attractive and friendly enough and b) the food is at least average, then they can be excellent places to eat and hang out. Unfortunately, neither is is quite true in this case. When it comes to both food and service, there is this feeling like the place is simply going through the motions of a big, corporate chain. That used to not be the case when the restaurant first opened. However, there has been a perceptible decline, over time, as many of the early-generation staff members have come and gone. I really hope the place can get it together again, with some renewed attention to detail and customers. As for now, I would not recommend this restaurant except for the most rudimentary late-night dining and drinking needs."}
{"text":"Bartenders and manger need to learn to tend the bar. Serve the customers at the bar and help the tables at the same damn time! Pretty girls, good menu but get your shit together!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I usually give businesses the benefit of the doubt... but half an hour wait for a not to great breakfast burrito with like 10 tater tots is extremely bad. Especially when there was only one guy ahead of me. The only reason why I'm not giving this place 1 star is because the lady with red hair in the front was really sweet, and one of the male workers was nice enough to check on me when I was waiting forever... all in all I won't be going back though."}
{"text":"Not bad, not fantastic, a-ok. The location is great, of course, and this is kind of like the Irish version of Hooters. Typical bar food, waitresses in skimpy outfits. Going on a football Sunday, be prepared for lots of games, and lots of volume! It is hard to have a conversation, but I guess if you're going to watch games, cheer loudly, and drink- this is your place! I actually liked the long table at the front- it is seat yourself, and the design of it makes it easy to meet new people as you eat.  The food- somewhat overpriced, but decent enough. Wings, big burgers, sandwiches. The service was a little slow, but considering that it was so busy, it was understandable. There are a few other places I'd try at the Linq before returning, but I wouldn't go out of my way to avoid it, either."}
{"text":"Stopped into Tilted Kilt for the first time last night.  Obviously one of the attractions to this place is the attractive wait staff. When asked if they had any specials - the response was we have boobs, we don't need specials.  Well played!  Our waitress - 'Smurfette' was excellent.  Very friendly, checked back frequently to see if we needed anything, how the food was, etc.  Definitely ask for her!  There is a good variety of food from burgers, wings, sandwiches, pizzas - to several 'traditional' entrees like Shepherd's Pie.  I went with the Gaelic Chicken. From the menu -- That's \"Gaelic\" not \"Garlic\"... Pan seared Chicken Breasts with sautéed Mushrooms and Onions served with a to-die-for Irish Whiskey Cream Sauce served over Garlic Mashed Potatoes or Fettuccini and Garlic Bread.   The waitress suggested to go with the mashed potatoes - excellent choice.  2 large pieces of a chicken on top of a good sized portion of the mashed potatoes, all covered with a really good sauce.  The garlic bread was great for dipping in the sauce.  I decided to try the Irish Stew as a side. I wasn't overly impressed with this - pretty dry and not a lot of taste but a pretty good amount of beef and topped with mashed potatoes.  I don't think I'd order that again.  Everything else was really good though.  Thanks for the great service and good food. Sad to see Fat Fish Blue which was previously in this location gone.  But, this definitely is a fun place to hangout, eat, drink and enjoy."}
{"text":"We went here for a friends birthday after our first choice in restaurant gave away our reservation to another group. So I give them a star for being able to accommodate us on such short notice on a Saturday night. The other star is because their fried pickles appetizer with cayenne ranch hit the spot.  Everything else was meh. Out of our group or 15 they got a couple orders wrong, not bad I guess. However, the service was slow and the meals were meh, with smaller portions then you expect from most restaurants.  After our meal our waitress seemed to just disappear and we had to track her down to get the check.  Overall wouldn't come back. But then again they aren't really using their excellent food and service to get people in the door..."}
{"text":"I know it's Vegas, but really $11 for a draught beer in the middle of a Tuesday afternoon. I guess you have to pay for all those \"hostess\" standing around! Won't be back. Cheers"}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood bar, Tilted Kilt has an amazing selection of wings sauces. I love that they are served alongside French fries! There are tons of televisions, making this a great place to watch the game (if you can get a table)."}
{"text":"so surprised to see all the 1 star ratings on here.  went last night walking distance from the us airways arena after the michael jackson cirque show.  at the desk is a sign saying txt this number for a free appetizer, got a free order of irish fries they were GREAT!  also ordered wings, sausage sampler and bacon wrapped chicken skewer, plus 2 beers, all were good.  the girls were hot.  only downfall was LOUD!"}
{"text":"Our service was horrible and it wasn't even busy. It took the waitress 10 minutes to even approach our table. She was more interested in flirting with the male occupied tables around us. I ordered a flatbread pizza and my friend ordered a chicken sandwich and side salad. After an hour, we still had no food. But the tables around us got their food...which included some of the same food we ordered. Finally, the waitress came by our table and told us they were remaking my flatbread since they put the wrong sauce on it. We explained we had been there over an hour and were trying to catch a movie in 30 minutes and asked how much longer. She disappeared to the kitchen for another 10 minutes and came back with no food and an \"I don't know\" answer. She never even brought out my friends salad or sandwich while waiting. Another 10 minutes later, the food finally came and of course my friends sandwich was cold. We asked for the bill as soon as she laid the food down. We inhaled our food and still were waiting for the bill. At no point did she ever apologize or give us more than 10 seconds of attention."}
{"text":"There's a new pub in town....  Located at the corner of 4th St SW and 17th Ave SW in the old Bob The Fish Tavern's location, other pubs and grills beware the ladies of the Tilted Kilt.  It gets crowded on Thursdays so best to get there early. With TV's everywhere, you cannot miss the games. Because of this, it is pretty loud. Not a good place for a romantic date but a good place to cruise. The walls have many replicas of old and odd pictures. It is well-lit but not too bright. Most tables either hold 2 or 4 people but can easily be coupled for larger groups. Apparently, it is mostly guys as customers to see the skimpy kilt outfits on the waitresses.  The waitresses are very friendly and attentive if not a bit distracting but beauty  has her way. The two ladies I had were very familiar with the menu and recommended either a burger or cheesesteak.  I got the Scottish Cheesesteak containing shaved ribeye steak topped with grilled peppers, onions, and melted provolone cheese with Onion Rings instead of french fries with the Sailor Punch Shaker that comee in a Bell Mason jar which has Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum, 3 Olives Orange Vodka, Lime Sour, Sprite, and Monin Peach Puree.  I would love to see more natural condiments instead of the Heinz brand that has Canada's version of High Fructose Corn Syrup, glucose-fructose (a salt masquerading as a sweetner).  All in all, a fun place if a bit loud but it is a party and sometimes we need that. Cannot wait to come back for one of the \"big-arse\" burgers."}
{"text":"It was a long time ago, so I don't know if this has changed. It wasn't just the waitrets that were scanty, it was the pints too.   I know it was Arizona, I know it was hot, but even by my standards the first \"pint\" went down awfully fast. So did the second, so for the third roun d, I ordered a can of something. Poured it into the pint glass and the 12oz can filled the \"pint\" glass to the brim  I wrote to the AZ equivalent of the TABC - never heard back, never heard from the TC. I hope the new one in Grapevine, TX doesn't mislead by calling a 12oz pour a pint. Of course they won't - everything is bigger in Texas.  Of course these woossy 16oz pints are shameful too. A many pint is an Imperial Pint at 20 oz!"}
{"text":"The food at this location was good. The staff was friendly and very helpful with suggestions. I woud visit again"}
{"text":"It's a clubhouse for hambones when they need a break from the hooknasties.   Pretty girls in skimpy outfits to disguise the fact you're overpaying for subpar food.   No thanks."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the place. My wife was along. There is a decent beer selection and I tried some \"craft\" beers. There is lots of greasy food which fits with the dietary preferences of the clientele. I had burger and fries: ok. I found servers quite friendly and we got good service. My wife was concerned about the outfit wondering if it should be adjusted up or down. (We have been to a Hooters with my late father-in-law and this is more risqué.)  The waitress seemed quite proud of it when my spouse inquired. I thought it a good place but doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Not sure what it is but in Vegas you tend to get that next level of experience with customer service. This kilt was a very inviting place from the heat. Sat at the bar and chatted it up with a lovely kilt girl named Jean. She was very accommodating and made me feel welcome.  I drank for an hour and a half to kill time and watched sports on the many TVs on the walls. For a Tuesday morning this place was pretty busy with tourists.  The upstairs portion seems to be seats going around a railing and had no tables whatsoever.  That was a bummer.  Overall, a good time and Jean was a cool chick to chat with."}
{"text":"The food and service is always great at the multiple locations we've gone to. Had a great late night dinner last night but our first impression from the hostess was not good. Whoever the blonde hostess was between 9:30-10pm Sat. 10/23 at the downtown Phoenix location needs to learn how to smile. From the moment we walked in the door until she put our menus on the table felt like she was being bothered to help us....your customers....no smile, no enjoy your meal.....nothing. I thought maybe it was because it was late and we had our 12 y/o son with us but I watched her seat three other tables near us....same attitude....we at least got eye contact.....yay!! And when we left, she was standing at the hostess stand by herself, leaning against the back counter.....again no smile, thank you for coming......NOTHING!! Pretty girl but very ugly attitude!! I know she's young but someone might want to tell her if she's having fun with customers while she's working....her shift will go by much faster!!  We will be back and probably sooner than later for some yummy food and cold beer!! Just thought you might like to retrain or switch out your front line personal."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a snack. We got salads and chicken fingers. The food was very good. Our waitress was friendly. It was our first time at a Tilted Kilt. I would go again."}
{"text":"Yes...it's all true about the kilt. The ladies are beautiful and less than modestly dressed.  Looking past that, which is hard to do, it is a good sports bar.  I was completely sold in this place when I learned they serve breakfast on football Saturdays and Sundays.  Occasional slow service keeps me from giving 5 stars.  Wives and girlfriends lacking confidence or a desire to see the best of Ireland need not come."}
{"text":"Wasted my time waiting at the bar. 10 long minutes and not even greeted much less a water and a menu. I left and went to Steak & Lube. Much much better service."}
{"text":"First, yes, the waitresses were beautiful, even on a Monday night.  Drinks were average at best...lots very dark Jack & Cokes.   Food was terrible.  Frozen pizza appetizer was the lowlight.  Highlight was the what seemed to be homemade potato chips.  They were nice. 2 stars for the outfits but no stars for service.  Had our waitress had more of a personality, we may have stayed longer.  But weak drinks, bad food and poor service are not a good combination. Oh, and add in the creepy guys who were there eating by themselves and not a good situation.  Made me long for Hooter's...(OK, that part isn't true.)"}
{"text":"This place sucks !! Been here before and food was fair and servers didn't seem to care and were not engaged.  Went on St. Patricks Day with a group and server didn't even smile. Took half an hour to bring two drinks and water, and server sent another server out with 2 drinks and forgot the water I had ordered. Quickly closed out the tab and headed over to the SandBar for a great time, happy servers and good food."}
{"text":"I always get the same thing. I love their steak salad.  This time we were here for a game and we ordered happy hour food.  I thought it was all pretty good.  I like that they have a pretty good sized beer list.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Checked this place out this past Friday night and besides the Dj, it was basically dead.  The bartender was having a hard time washing & rewashing glasses and the hostess were barely staying awake.  I get it- it's a winter night on the North Shore with nothing going on but WHY ARE DRAFT BEERS $5.50 FOR MILLER LIGHT?  With ALL the options, all over the North Shore, and across the river in town or South Side- why would anyone want to drink here?  I think the only thing saving this place is that sometimes there's a wait at Rivertown so they get the overflow.  Oh yea- bring a coat cause I don't think they turn the heat on- hoping that their sparse crowd will heat it up.    This place stinks- go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Wow.  I'm not even sure where to start.  I know there are several of these around town but I had not previously been to one.    Every table is assigned two servers, all comely young ladies in short plaid skirts (SO not kilts) and bras with white shirts tied above the midriff.  They're all really cute and friendly, to be sure, but I don't -- repeat DO NOT -- want them to SIT DOWN at my table and stay, making lame conversation.    (before you call me a prude, I *like* going to strip clubs, they're honest and call it what it is.  I don't want to be confused about whether I'm in sport bar or a gentleman's club...)  There were literally 100 servers on the floor on a Saturday late afternoon.  It was impossible to have a conversation or watch the game, because the Gemini Twin Barbie servers wouldn't leave us alone.  We were most amused at the old couple who looked like they were in from Wisconsin for the All Star game, looking both bemused and alarmed that their two servers just plopped down at their table and watched them eat.    Honestly, the damnedest thing I've ever seen.  If you're alone and lonely or you want to go look at some boobs without the cost and stigma of the strip clubs, this is the place for sure.  If you just want a beer, conversation, or to watch the game, you really need to find somewhere else to go.  Ick.  Just ick...."}
{"text":"This place is run down and dirty.  The servers are not very friendly.  The food is ok.  I have tried to like this place. All 3 times I left disappointed.  I hope they get it together."}
{"text":"Food was good, was not very crowded at all. Was able to get a bar seat and/or table with no problem.  Wait staff was OK, usually they are more friendly."}
{"text":"Went here for a Fantasy Draft Party.   Great place. Especially the manager (whose name escapes me at the moment) who really went out of his way to make sure we were properly setup. I mean the guy brought out HDMI cables and everything so we could connect our laptop to the screen. Service was out of this world.   Food was great too. I had some of those boneless wings and they were great.   Will definitely be back here. Never expected this kind of service from a Pub, but it's definitely great."}
{"text":"Good selection of drafts - bartender was great and have me 3 samples to try! - we did not try the food though"}
{"text":"This was my second time here, I enjoyed the Calamari the last time I was here so I convinced my fiancé to go with me to give this place a try. It's a nice little pub the overall theme fits the name Tilted Kilt.   We came for lunch I wasn't too hungry so we ordered a few appetizers. From entering the restaurant to leaving I have to say one of the worst services I have ever experienced coming from the Las Vegas Strip.   You can tell that the focus of this place is on the girls. Which is great put pretty girls in cute outfits and have their bubbly personalities serve guest. Clearly sex sells especially in Vegas. The idea is there but the execution isn't. Other than the fact that some of these girls look underage I have never encountered such horrible personalities. This isn't a night club and these girls are far away from those standards they shouldn't hold themselves so high up the podium acting like their better then everyone around them.  The hostess was clueless when I approached her looking for my party. I don't know if my server was sober or just not all there cause she would just stare at us without any reaction. Started to clear the table while we where still eating without excusing herself. The girls at the front where all busy gossiping while the ones by the bar gossiped as well. They kept glancing at our table then would talk amongst each other and stare again. Don't make it go obvious when your talking about someone. On our way out not one of the 3-4 hostesses at the podium took the time to welcome us back or even wish us a good day.  This team is so unprofessional they are to into themselves/their personal lives vs. serving their guest. It's actually sad cause this place has decent food, decent prices, decent atmosphere but service plays a big role in dining for me it's the overall experience that matters.   I would recommend Yard House over this place if your looking for a decent dining experience on the Linq Promenade."}
{"text":"I just left after waiting 20 minutes for the bartender, Susie, to take my order.   At this rate the  game would be over by the time I ordered.   My beer was good but that is thanks to Sam Adams.    I will not go back to this tilted kilt. I would rather eat overpriced ball park food.    I wish I could have reviewed the food, but my time is more valuable than the tilted kilt realizes."}
{"text":"Yes the servers are beautiful.  The food is decent.  Good happy hour specials.  A large Blue Moon for $6.50.  The sliders were good.  They didn't come as I ordered.  The waitress never noticed she didn't bring a side order.  The food overall was ok to good.  The sweet potato fries were the only bad item.  I know, hard to mess up sweet potato fries, but they did.  Overall if you want a fun atmosphere and don't have high expectations, you will enjoy the Tilted Kilt."}
{"text":"Yes , Food was great . You really get you're money's worth ."}
{"text":"Went to the tilted kilt 2 watch the 2014 nfl playoff games. The place was packed but I was seated,greeted and served within minutes. The $4 spicy bloody mary was fantastic. The ambiance was nice and so was the food. I recommend you try the bloody mary when u visit."}
{"text":"I really felt bad about coming here....I just felt like a dirty old man looking at young women with barely anything on so I left.I say do yourself a favor and stop exploiting young women!!!Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We have a rather large group (#evfn) that meets on Friday nights at different places throughout the east valley and last night we hit Tilted Kilt.  The bad: Crappy Parking.  Moving company next door takes up half the available parking with their trucks at night.  I rounded the entire full parking lot before double parking beside said trucks.  The cacophony. It's just too loud. Visually loud with TV screen on every available surface and beer/ale/sports paraphernalia squashed between.  And generally loud with all those hard surfaces bouncing sound around.  Our group was set dead center of the place and we were practically screaming to the person directly across the table to be heard.  The good: Strongbow.  My favorite drink is Strongbow and while it's not on the menu, when I mentioned it to the waitress she had the gumption to go find out if they had it.  And they did.  Our waitress worked her barely covered tushy off and I didn't hear many complaints from our group.  Sure, the orders took awhile, but we had one primary waitress for over 25 people and she never stopped moving.  We'd been invited there by management and provided gratis nachos which took forever to get to us, but the actual dinner I ordered came within a respectable amount of time and was quite good.  So maybe the parking lot would be emptier mid-week.  Maybe it wouldn't be so loud out on the patio.  I'll probably go back, but only if my group goes or sometime other than a weekend night."}
{"text":"If you spend enough time in this city you know that you're going to pay a premium for a very good meal. The days of $9.99 prime rib on the strip are long over and in its place are the painfully average, the \"celebrity\" chefs and casino food courts. However, if you look hard enough you'll find a place that does taste good without dropping a small fortune.  I ordered the Pub Fried Egg burger which was cooked perfectly, but the yoke wasn't as runny as I would've preferred. Jenn had the Chicken Tender Wrap that she said was great. They do lose a star for the egg. Sorry.   Let's discuss the elephant in the room: the waitstaff. Outstanding. Ours was a young lady who's name escapes me, but she was from Connecticut and she was freaking hot. Yeah, I said it. Relax. She was also really good at what she did as she was prepared with her own home printed beer list to give us as opposed to reciting the whole thing and having me not hear most of it.   I enjoyed this place and would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Dumbest waitresses . Terrible service.  Just an overall terrible experience.  1 hour and 30 min to get food?  Pretty ridiculous.  Yard house is right by it go there they actually have good service and know how to interact with guests!"}
{"text":"On paper, happy hour sounds great. In reality, it sucked for us. Drinks were very pricey and the food was okay, even at 50% off. However our bartender was very rude and snarky. She had a rather bitchy attitude. Go to Brooklyn Bowl for better food and drink prices."}
{"text":"I came here with no expectation just wanted to check the place out. Our server Kelly was awesome! Sweet, helpful and gave us some recommendations. Our soup was ok. We ordered the beer cheese soup but it reminded my niece of queso dip. A little spicy, a thicker consistency but no real pizzaz.  We decided to get the BBQ cheese burger and garlic Parmesan fries. It took a bit to come out and when it finally arrived the fries were undercooked and cold, the bun was as cold as the vegetables on the burger and the patty from just an external touch was tepid (at best). The server was quick to take it back and have it fixed.  Two minutes later it comes out. I think WOW that's fast. How did they do that and my niece pointed out it was the same plate of food. Upon inspection, it was. The fries were put back in the fryer and the bun toasted (too much at this point, it was hard around the edges) and the same lukewarm patty all places back before me. I summoned the manager. He explained he was sorry it was a mistake and would have it re-made an additional time. He emphasized everyone makes a mistake now and again. I readily agreed. I stated that when they brought out the food knowing it had been back there some time and was probably running on the cold side. When I returned it expecting a fresh hot meal and had a reheated variation of the original was returned to me.. That wasn't a MISTAKE.. It's dishonest. I kindly stated at that point unless he made it personally I didn't trust his kitchen with my food. He removed the burger off my bill and I paid for my beverage and soup. I tipped Kelly on the original bill amount (so she's not penalized for a poor kitchen) and wrote this review! I wouldn't go back nor will I recommend my clients and friends."}
{"text":"When we entered the building, we were greeted by the sweetest host we have ever been seated by. Her name was Angela but soon became Mrs. Epic.  After being seated at a reserved table for the next three days - our servers Jass., Ashley W., Paije, Jessie, Natalie, Celeste and Heather.  All the managers we dealt with - MJ, Jenny, and Clay were amazing.  We had the greatest time and heard the greatest stories every night we went to Tilted Kilt Phoenix.  The host and servers approached our table every night as friendly as can be.      We tried new places every night we stayed in Phoenix and always ended back at the Tilted Kilt!  If you are in the Phoenix area and are looking for a great time with great food and servers, visit the Tilted Kilt in Phoenix, AZ!"}
{"text":"Poor service, 3 of the items I ordered from the menu were not available, paid for the pool table only to find out they are missing 4 balls. And not happy to find out they don't have pitchers. And I had to pay a cover charge to come in, it was only $5 but it's not right no one else charges a fee. WILL NOT RETURN"}
{"text":"Went back after the GM was generous enough to invite us back for a hopefully more pleasant visit. This time, the timing of the delivery of appetizers and entree was on par. They were \"out of\" a flatbread pizza that i wanted for whatever reason but the other food i ordered tasted good. (Charged us 0.50 extra for sauce with wings)  Normal Bud light beer is about $8 a glass which is a tad ridiculous  The service was a touch better than last time, but the waitresses still seem very clueless and scatterbrained, This certainly is still not what i remember the TK being like years ago when it was in the Rio and although i appreciate the GMs concern for our experiences i dont think ill be coming in here again because in Vegas there are just too many places that provide amazing service and where the staff is top notch. That does not include this joint."}
{"text":"Came here a month ago with a group of my car buddies. Even though service was slow, food was decent."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday for a friends birthday party.  Karaoke was fun.  Food was good. Try the garlic fries!!!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Staff started out ok for our first round. After that it was a little downhill. Took a while to get more drinks. Had to tell the bartender twice I needed a beer. Took a good ten minutes to get it. Girls working the bar seemed to be in over their heads."}
{"text":"My first time there tonight. The crowd is younger, tattooed, biker, rough looking type. Fine if that is your think but not mine. The staff look cute in the uniforms, but are horrible at customer service. The waitress rarely came by, and I had to track her down to pay my bill. The drink special was great, but only 1 beer was on special. Lots of TVs to watch sports. Beer pong was fun to watch others play."}
{"text":"Your typical cloned Irish pub/English pub whatever crossover pub. The \"enhanced\"bimbette was so preoccupied with organizing bottles and convincing management that she had bright ideas, that she left my empty plate of ehh fish n chips linger for a good 20 minutes before she moved it. Yea she's annoying. Thank god for her that the place is loaded with 9-5 warriors. Killer fries. Lol"}
{"text":"From Out of town looking for some good food. Not the kilt well eating are over price food the power goes out force to eat are dinner in the. Dark and no a c. Thumbs down"}
{"text":"We stopped into this pub for a bite to eat and watch the soccer tournament being played in Brazil.  England lost, which did not make a lot of Brits sitting in the bar very happy.  My first visit to Tilted Kilt left me thrilled and disappointed at the same time.  I was thrilled because it is a wonderful sports bar with a great business model.  The servers are probably the friendliest I've encountered in a long time. Paula had no problem spending time with us and that made us feel right at home.  They also offered us a discount simply because we were locals (people who actually live in Vegas)..  We really did enjoy ourselves, that is, until the food came.  It would probably be no surprise to our friends to hear that we chose the fish and chips on the menu.  We've been looking for a good one since our favorite place for this item closed last year.  The fish was a beer-battered cod that the restaurant proudly claims is made with Sam Adams beer.  It is proudly displayed on the menu as a featured item.  We were very disappointed.  It looked great when it arrived in the basket with fries and onion rings on the side but, we quickly lost interest as we dug in.  The breading was quite doughy and flavorless.  it tasted like grease and when I took a fork and pressed into the fish, it oozed oil.  The same for the onion rings and fries.  Greasy as can be.  This tells me the oil was not hot enough when the food was dropped in.  Why can't these kitchens test the the temperature of oil before they dip anything into it?  Why doesn't a good  line cook or chef know that it takes time for a deep fryer to recover heat lost after frying a batch of battered fish?  Maybe it's me.  Maybe I expect too much but, I don't think so.  I grew up on the East Coast having fish and chips every Friday for most of my young life.  While in school, I worked at several restaurants that specialized in making fish and chips .. or a \"fish fry\" as we called them.  I guess I'll just have to keep looking for that elusive fish fry.  As for the Tilted Kilt; it's a fine place to sit and have a beer!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Waitresses don't tend to your table. We were ignored for 30 minutes....not even menu's! Courtney was the waitress for our table. Never gonna go to this place again."}
{"text":"Wait time... Why should I wait for a drink for 25 mins? My wife was craving their chicken fried steak and now we have to go somewhere. Pathetic. I don't care about waiting but having a pregnant woman wait is just sad. The place was dead and the girls were farting around shooting the poo in the back."}
{"text":"An irish bar with girls barely dressed, and one of the original corporate locations, on a Sunday at 11 am for NFL football (including the Cardinals game). How could they screw that up?  Well, they did. Our table of 4 waited for 15 minutes and never got so much of a look from any of the waitresses. The restaurant was at best half full, and it was a football sunday, so I would expect to get a server when I sat down.  The waitresses and hostess, the ones that I could see that wouldn't help us or acknowledge us in any way, were all ugly and looked pissed off to be there.  I had seen the owner on undercover boss and thought he was a tool, so I'm kind of glad that I didn't spend any $ there, and I hope you don't as well. There are plenty of places that put service and food quality above whoring their waitresss, spend your money there instead."}
{"text":"Wow, so this is quite the place on a weekday night!   Lots of TV'S all around the joint! You won't miss a thing. The girls are all nice looking to say the least. Super skimpy outfits. I think it is a lot better than Hooters, The food is so so but, not horrilbe. Give it a try,it is for sure something very different."}
{"text":"I don't remember the service - aside from the pregnant waitress, the food or the beer.  I do remember looking at all the ladies in the bar area wondering why the HELL they were dressed to the slut-acular 9's.   Then it hit me: they're trying to pick up the guys who can't make it with the waitresses.  Clever, and a little sad... and that makes for awesome AWESOME awesome people viewing! It's sooo much better than the airport!!!"}
{"text":"It's loud, food is average, but the girls are all hot and wearing small outfits. It's basically exactly like every other Tilted Kilt.   Honestly there's nothing that stands out about this place compared to any of the other ones in the chain. If you've been to one, you've basically been to them all. The enjoyment of this place is purely dependent upon your company not because you came here for an amazing culinary experience."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar where women walk around revealing some of the good lords better inventions. Solid bar food and plenty of screens to watch the games, which they will adjust to your liking to accommodate your favorite team. Its close to home, so i have become quite a regular, as it kills Hooters both in food and fun."}
{"text":"Went with a groupon, will not be back. Audio far to loud, chopped turkey salad required a microscope to find the turkey and fish and chips were way to greasy. Fries were good but when you put greasy fish on top of them they are gross."}
{"text":"Another poster put it best. It's the Irish version of Hooters. Although I would rate Tilted Kilt a little classier and cleaner than a Hooters. The waitresses are good to look at and the beer is cold, although a bit pricey. We didn't try the food, but I didn't have much to complain about."}
{"text":"I work in the casino next door and our staff orders here often so if there's issues with the food we won't order from here anymore. That's almost 50 people on a regular basis weekly not paying patronage to our fellow business and I really don't want that to happen but....  Phone orders are not correct, and I ordered chicken finders hot with blue cheese.  Yes I know it's not typical hot on the menu but when I order them the girl said we don't have chicken fingers, we have chicken tenders... Um really lol wow. Then she said so buffalo? You mean barbecue? No, I went over it 4 times. And a few of my colleagues got food there recently and it was wrong.   Yes the food quality is good but it's a little ridiculous the lack of food knowledge they have here. There's so many choices for food so I would train your staff a little better otherwise you'll lose alot of business."}
{"text":"Yes I'm reviewing this....why not?  Just an Scottish version of a Hooters bar, whats not to love.  But of course, the food as expected isn't all that great, but the ladies are shall I say, have nice outfits and truly warm up to you.  Cheers to ASU.  Heck, you even get a collectors card to take home and show your wife and kids.    For the upside, at least it made my trip to Tempe somewhat memorable, even though it required venturing outside to Phoenix for a drink and grub.  Just a 30 min travel away and 2 transfers.    For the food:  -Garlic Fries - bleh, although its the skinnier type fries, no one does it better than Gordon Biersch  -Spinach Dip - bland and too chunky  -Grilled Buffalo Wings - I got like 3 that were burnt, and although its supposedly different from the deep fried type, they were just like the ones you cook on the bbq, except .....more burnt.  I didn't enjoy it that much I had myself to blame since I was craving wings for some reason.  -Side of Dublin Stew - Probably the one thing I'm glad I got since it was sort of like a Shepards Pie in stew form.  Tasty and pretty filling.  As for the drinks:  -After all, the bar was just calling out to me and although I had hoped to see more beers on tap, unfortunately, a majority of their beer list was bottled.  I went with the Kilt Lifter...something that sounded rather appropriate which turned out to be like an IPA but toned down and had a sweeter taste like that of a Hef."}
{"text":"The food here was actually pretty decent. I think what is unfortunate is that the poor service was so horrible that it ruined the entire experience all together. From sit down to walking out the door I have never had a waitress act the way that ours did. Her name was \"Ash\" and I hope she sees this and takes it as a learning experience. Walking up to the table and rolling your eyes, not responding, and being blatantly rude to customers when we are simply taking drink orders... Not ok, but with me personally she got mad that I had given her a military i.d. Because the birthday is located on the back. In sorry you needed to turn it over? Then when she brought out our drinks, she hit one of the other guests while putting a drink down, did not apologize. Then spilled someone else's drink all over my lap and in my purse- again without apologizing (now see I personally am not upset about the spilling, accidents happen. But the trick is to be polite and at least get some napkins). Then waited 30minutes for our food. As I said the food wasn't bad. But when it came time for the bills, I paid in cash and was expecting my change (yes at this point I was expecting to tip her because again sometimes people just have bad days) she brings out everyone else's change and receipts. But does not give me mine, and when I asked for it she got mad and rolled her eyes, stormed off, brought back a couple bills- no recipt, not even the right change amount. And threw it I front of me. At this point- no, I will not leave a good tip. Are you kidding me? If you act like you hate your job so much I do not know why you do it. Again I hope she sees this and next time won't act this way to customers who haven't done anything to her. I will never go here again, I was so let down because I have heard such wonderful things, but they were wrong!"}
{"text":"Well, in another city and another trip to a Tilted Kilt. Great location,always like the ladies,building was pretty run down. Good food for the type of place it is. Had the Tilted Bloody Mary and was surprised by how good they were. Always recommend Tilted Kilts!"}
{"text":"We went here with a bunch of (male) coworkers... I was open to this place as I have been to Hooters and received amazing food and service.   This place was definitely rock bottom.    The servers looked disengaged.  The food was cold and stale (appetizers).  They did NOT have a drink menu.  Apparently all they knew how to serve was beer.  They said they could \"make anything\".  I beg to differ.  The margarita I ordered was like a frozen snowball.  It barely melted after an hour and a half.  I could tip it almost upside down and nothing came out.  Pretty sure there was no alcohol in it either.  The service was spotty.  There were like 6 of us at the beginning but then another six joined.  The server was like oh are you new to the party?  You didn't notice we doubled in size?  Omg I could not get out of there fast enough.  I am not a chain restaurant person but the Keg next door was infinitely times better and knew how to make a drink and their food was amazing.  Tilted Kilt unfortunately is a waste of space."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out Tilted Kilt and the opportunity presented itself last week.  It was kind of funny. Besides the waitresses, I was the only female in the whole place.  Our server was busy but looked good so you can't really complain. Our food came out how we ordered and pretty quickly.  We got the Irish nachos, which were on happy hour ($5) and the Kilt Club and split everything. I really enjoyed the Club. It had a pesto mayo on it that was really yummy and really good bread. The nachos were good but I enjoyed the sandwich more.  I also loved the atmosphere. As a sports junkie, it was basically my kind of joint. They had drop down screens that played baseball so I was a happy camper.  Definitely a fun place to check out the eye candy and watch a ball game. I'll be back."}
{"text":"take hooters and give it a scottish feel, and you have the tilted kilt. we had one of our dinners here and we had an absolutely good time. the waitresses were a little on the slow side with the drinks, however eventually everything balanced out and everyone was happy.  the meal of choice was a shrimp dinner with fries and some chips and spicy salsa for  an appetizer, and everything was tasty and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I went there with my friend for his 21st anniversary. Nice atmosphere, good service. Our drinks were served fast and the food was average bar food. We enjoyed trivia night and had a great time!"}
{"text":"First off you should know this is basically an Irish hooters. We sat at the bar and our server was Brian. We ordered the spinach and artichoke for an appetizer. It wasn't the greatest but it wasn't bad. For lunch we ordered the grilled wings which were awesome its just too bad I had to wait so long for them. We ordered a double order and he only brought one order. He said he didn't hear us which would be understandable except that he also messed up our sauce order twice. It seemed that his co bartender had no issues so it was probably just him. I really did like the wings. I had them plain with the sauce on the side. The signature kilt sauce was your average buffalo sauce and the sweet and spicy was also good (its not spicy though). I would eat here again just not with the same waiter."}
{"text":"Move over hooter's. First sunny weekend of the spring. WE decided to stop by for some drinks. The ambience of the patio is not much to talk about. However if you are a male, the focus will be elsewhre. Think of hooters but sexier with scottish kilts. Well priced and good service."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in here for lunch today.  It  was the first time for both of us.  It is a give in that there are scantly clad ladies running around.  The server we had was very good with her customer service. On top of refilling our drinks and making sure everything was good.  The food itself was very good also.     The thing we did not like is that heavy metal music was blaring the entire time and there was a drunken patron at the bar swearing, loudly, at what I believe was the NASCAR race.  Nascar isn't even exciting let alone worth yelling at the tv.    Food is good.  Scenery is good.  Remember it is also a pub and you will be fine."}
{"text":"Where shall I start with this place? As I walk in even though my girlfriend will be mad reading this lol. The sights were quite refreshing for an old man of 47. Beyond that the place was pathetic bc it was cold and way too many accessible doors to smoke. The beer was cold and there was a nice selection including mixed drinks. The food was worse than dog food out of a can. Actually that's what the Shepherd pie looked like and the taste was 2 out of 10 at best. The calamari appetizer was so overcooked there was nothing but a rock breading. It actually made my gums hurt and I still have my teeth.  The fish and chips were 6 out of 10. The steak salad was a 7-8 out of 10. Perhaps the burgers are better as they looked good. Will I try this place again? Yes but only for a burger and more scenery. Dangit I'm in more trouble now."}
{"text":"Best thing I've tried on the menu is the fish and chips - pretty darned good (and you don't even have to ask for the malt vinegar, it's on the table already, along with the ketchup. The Irish Dip is on the lunch special - pretty good deal for $7.50 Lots of space, but not a huge lunch crowd. Based on the banners during football season, this is the place locally to go watch the Sooners play football."}
{"text":"Crappy food, feminist bartenders in a basic sportsbar atmosphere.. go somewhere else for a drink if you're a man"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered a few Hop knot beers.   We had wings 1/2 mango habanero 1/2 kilt burner. Nice burn but not to hot.   Other order was spicy mother clucker sandwich & tots. Also great flavor.   Service was great Michaela was funny and attentive"}
{"text":"This place is the worst. The amout of losers and old people that come here just makes you avoid this place at all costs. I can care less about the hoes that work here either"}
{"text":"The only thing good about our stop here was the Irish nachos. The rest is 1 star.   Service was horrible. Brought the wrong order 1st then checked on us twice in over an hour. Our waitress only had 3 tables as it was a Monday about 5:00 pm. I realize she was hired for her looks but come on...  Bathroom and overall establishment was very dirty.   My wife and I both have worked in the service industry and are easy to please. This place leaves a lot to be desired. If you're in the area do yourself a favor and go to Abuelos or Firebirds. We have had equally as good of food but much better service at both."}
{"text":"Food was good (fish & chips, veggie burger), waitress was friendly, but the beer price was too high. I don't mind paying for good beer but $10 for a Blue Moon on a Tuesday afternoon seemed expensive compared to other local restaurants in Las Vegas who charge $7 for a pint."}
{"text":"Only deserves two stars because our waitress was classy and well kept unlike some of them that work here. The food was horrendous and absolutely over priced. I ordered the hot wings and they came out an hour later cold and tasted as if they were microwaved. The slimy texture was so off putting I sent them back without hesitation. This place is not for the faint of heart when it comes to good looking women and good food. Just a knock off of hooters."}
{"text":"What a GREAT experience we had at our fantasy football draft! Well, we always have a GREAT time at this location,(7077 East Bell Road, Scottsdale, AZ. 85254) and this time we had a very pleasant & over the top server Lixuan! Lixuan made sure that everyone in our group had exactly what they needed and she did it with a smile! Our glasses were constantly filled and she was always around when we needed her! Lixuan even remembered all of our names! Now this is a very special lady that really enjoys her work! You can be assured that we'll be back for our next fantasy football draft! It's employees like this that make the difference! Thank you so much!                                                                                 Sincerely,                                                                                                                     Ross N."}
{"text":"If being served cold beer and sub-standard food by legal aged young ladies dressed up like Braveheart Schoolgirls has always been your idea of a perfect bar experience, the Tilted Kilt won't disappoint.  I'd recommend eating somewhere else prior to coming here if you're hungry, though.    ('Twas a very odd choice for a work event....)"}
{"text":"My friends & I met up here for dinner. The service is CRAP! Our waitress was a total snob. my friend ask what kind of beers they had & I watched that girl rolled her eyes at my friend. she only gave us 1 menu. There were 4 of us at the table. She comes back & ask if we were ready to order, my bf told her no since we didn't have enough menus. she said she will go find some IF there's any. When we first came in, we saw that there were plenty of menus. At this point I can assume that She was just lazy! The food was good. The service was the worst! My bf asked for ketchup & she went & grabbed one from another table where there was people still sitting there & slammed it on our table. My friends left her $2 tip out of pity. my bf thought we should have left her a quarter. I paid so I left her NO TIP for NO SERVICE."}
{"text":"Let's start with the obvious.  The girls are dressed in a tiny skirt and a tiny bikini top. Yep, I totally get it. Have more guys in kilts! Anyway... I went in to have fun with some friends on Wednesday trivia night.  You know, have a drink or two and some dinner and fun. Well, this past Wednesday the service really stunk. Went and sat at the middle bar area so we could see the screen to play trivia. Waitress did not even try to greet us even when she passed us. Over halfway through the first round we asked Jeff, the awesome trivia announcer, if all the waitresses were on strike and only then did one come around. She was in a hurry to take the order and didn't even get the full order. The only reason she even checked on us afterwards was because we needed refills and I went to the bar myself to get them. During the whole time she was too busy helping the guys, putting her \"assets\" out there when walking by the guys and checking on....guess who... the guys. I know, it's a bar catering to the guys, but, if she would have been a good server she would have known that the girls also tip. Also....a word for the owner... I was going to order more than just a soda and an appetizer, but you lost that sale that night due to your poorly trained server. I hope when you move to your new building your serving staff will be better trained that all customers matter!"}
{"text":"First time at the Vegas location. Just stopped by for a drink and appetizer. My new fave is the Wild Cranberry seasonal drink with Wild Turkey. Spouse ordered the Rekorderlig cider. I'm not a huge cider fan but this is really good!   The best part was we asked if they had our college game on and they didn't but changed a channel and put it on for us and seated us right next to the screen.    Good service. Good overall experience."}
{"text":"Expect to wait at least 30 minutes before someone takes your drink order (even for water), then another 30 minutes to get your drinks.  After that first hour, we waited another 10 minutes for our food order to be taken. The waitress acted annoyed as if we were inconveniencing her. The only reason we stuck around was to watch the game.   I think we were told \"sorry, the bar is backed up\" at least three times, but each time the bar was nearly empty and the restaurant was not busy.   The food is nothing to get excited about. Everything was served cold and tasteless. Im typically not super picky, especially at a place like this, but I'm leaving with a whole appetizer and a meal nearly untouched."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out for the UFC fights! But come early to get a table! Otherwise if you have to get lucky like us and waited till people moved from the bar. But the bartender \"Bree\" showed amazing customer service. She served us among the many spectators of the fight with fast service and great attitude! First time at this location and if everyone has the same work ethic as Bree... I will definitely be coming back! Keep up the great work Bree! Respect!"}
{"text":"Love having another cool Irish pub in downtown Phoenix!  The atmosphere is lively and pretty noisy, the service is great and they carry Ace Pear Cider, so I am very happy!  This place should do really well!"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere and better than expected food. Definitely better than the alternative but similar type establishments."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've had here!!!!The food was tasty and that's the only way I give this place more than one star.  We were seated promptly as the restaurant was almost empty.  It took  our \"server\" 10 minutes to come to our table and ask for our drink order.  Once the order was taken, it took about 10-15 minutes to get the drink.  More time passes and we were finally able to get the server to take our food order.  She has the personality of a paper bag and I'm sure that if she smiled her face would probably crack.  Nice makeup, though.  Once the food was ordered we waited, two of us each ordering a burger, for 20-30 minutes for the food to arrive.  Maybe once or twice the server came walking past our table to ask \"how is everything tasting\", but not convincingly.  No apology for the lateness of the food.  She made us feel as though she were doing us a favor by serving us at all.  The manager of this place needs to read Yelp more often, because I am a staunch believer that everything that is wrong in a restaurant is ultimately the fault of the manager.  If you want a better staff, and you REALLY, REALLY need one, then you need to demand much more of them.  If you don't stand behind good service, neither will your staff.  It's that simple.  Other tables' waitresses seemed to much more pleasant and attentive, but ours did not even ask me if I wanted another beer!  Loss of revenue, Mr. or Ms. manager.  Pull your head out and raise the bar substantially or you will be out of business before you know it."}
{"text":"This is likely the worst place in Sauga for food. every meal is bland. I get the whole concept of waitresses in kilts but they are literally 18 year old kids, that are treated badly. I feel bad ordering from them."}
{"text":"Great Spot! We go for lunch mostly when we lived nearby. The service is not the best ever, but it's a sports bar and they are still pretty great. The entire staff is really nice but can be a little slow a times. They have a pool table and darts - and great drink specials!!"}
{"text":"Food was soo sooo  Service was sooo sooo  I just was not as happy as I thought I was going to be...  I will go back again, And hopefully the \"A\" squad , will be working , instead of the \"B\" squad..  BC I normally have a wonderful time , maybe I just expect more..."}
{"text":"The T.V's were the only positive experience we had. Have visited 20 different locations none a poor as this one. Really sad actually."}
{"text":"I visited with a good friend of mine for Halloween. The atmosphere is pretty cool with tvs everywhere and the staff is all very approachable. It was a little weird as I think we were the youngest males there as it was mostly 30 to 50, but I guess the old boys get a kick out of a young, pretty girl speaking to them.   The calamari was probably the best Pub style calamari I have ever had. Im not sure if it is from a box or breaded on site, but we were both raving about it. I ordered the burger with the fried egg. I was grinning from ear to ear about not having to take off any of the veggies, but I can see some people being annoyed by that. The patty was alright considering the setting.   All and all, I enjoyed it for what it was. My only issue was that the server did not know what craft beers were available, so I had to settle for something very generic in the Craft Beer world. Will I return? Bit of a tough call as when I saw my bill, I felt like my money may have been better spent elsewhere.  Great first impression for the most part."}
{"text":"Lots of food for a reasonable price. If I had kids I would bring them here. It's just not that big of a deal. Went with my husband and they had really good music."}
{"text":"Went during the day and the food was pretty terrible and super dirty place... Not the place for me!"}
{"text":"Visited Tilted Kilt before heading to the James Taylor concert. The place was super busy and it took quite a while for us to get our food even in the bar area. There was ample staff though to the point where the girls were tripping over each other to push food and drinks out so I'm not sure what the problem was.   Our appetizer came out with our meals which I hate and thus have to ding them for that. The other ding has to do with the appetizer itself. I get that they want to offer a 'happy hour' for appetizers but to charge me $3 for 1 piece of an appetizer to share between 3 people when I could spend $3 more to get an adequate portion for each of us is a little ridiculous. Drinks were not kept full and overall it was just a meh experience.   It's a fun place and I can see why people like it but if you are going for any sort of gastronomic experience--go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Well not the worst, not the best. Really, I hold breastaurants to a much lower standard than I do regular establishments. These guys had great selections of items, but none of which impressed me in the slightest. The service was pretty good and the price wasn't outlandish. I felt as though it was just a half attempt at restaurantism. The burger I had, (the spicy one) was ok as fast as concept but lacking in both spice and flavor. The cream cheese was a great idea, I did love that. I don't remember which burger my husband got, but he was unimpressed by it. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but I wouldn't refuse If it was in front of me."}
{"text":"Funny to see a couple of the recent reviews be for visitors when the WWE Royal Rumble was in town, as they seemed to be on their A-game that day compared to other reviews. But perhaps not their A \"talent\". Think of the Tilted Kilt as a Scotish version of Hooters with girls in provocative school girl outfits. Sounded good to me ... except I'd seen better talent at the Hooters in Manassas. Downtown Phoenix, you can do better than that!  They had a great vibe going before the Royal Rumble. Looking for our second spot to drink, my friend and I decided to try the Tilted Kilt because of proximity to the arena and high probability of good beer. When we approached, we saw a line forming out front and I immediately sensed this was a hot pre-Rumble spot. We moved through the crowded restaurant to the exterior bar area and, sure enough, it was the WWE Universe, right in your face.  It was a great pre-event atmosphere. Ample space outside to handle the crowds, a great vibe of people gathering from all over the world for a common event and interest, and solid service at a crowded \"college bar\" type of atmosphere. And the beer selection was pretty good. I think it was about 25 brews and reminded me of a Buffalo Wild Wings type of selection - heavy on the national \"microbrews\" like Sam Adams and Blue Moon, and the big name InBev imports. They did feature four beers from Four Peaks, a Tempe-based brewery that I saw everywhere in Phoenix. And the Hoegaarden was a nice touch. It's the beer that Blue Moon tried to copy, but failed miserably. It reminded me how much I love Hoegaarden (and despise Blue Moon)  I have a feeling my review would be different if I ate here ... this looks like one of those chainy food factories where everything would be bland and indistinguishable. But rating solely on the beer, service, and experience - 4 stars is deserved."}
{"text":"About what I expected. Went on a Monday night so I'm sure the experience would be different on the weekend. I was alone so I asked to be seated at the bar to the dismay of the seemingly bored waitstaff. I quickly found out why as the bar was basically the only populated area in the entire restaurant. Populated by you guessed it, solitary males. There was only two other women in the entire restaurant and they looked to be on a senior night out double date. Again, about what I expected. Bartender was friendly and she introduced herself. The next questions was what to drink. I noticed a decent beer selection but was disappointed to hear that they had no drink specials. She sold me on an IPA and then it was onto the menu. Again, about what I expected. I decided to go with the Rueben sandwich and found it to be a decent attempt. May return on a weekend night to give it another chance but overall, it was just okay."}
{"text":"Ambiance is excellent. DUH! Food was pretty good.  I had the chicken strip salad. One of my coworkers had the Shepards Pie and said it was very good. Another had the Corned Beef Sandwich with some spicy mustard and he said it was very good. The last of the party had a noodle dish and said it was good. So, overall, it was good."}
{"text":"Hi we ate here for lunch and the food was tasty. We had the irish dip and the veggie wrap. Draft beer was good and cold, the jack and jerry drink was a weird blending of flavors. Bathrooms are upstairs which is awkward. The waitresses are overly endowed and obviously told to showcase their wares.  Recommendation, please clean the menus, they are filthy."}
{"text":"I've been to the Tilted Kilt in LA and this place is a joke in comparison. On a Steelers GAME DAY they are out of ginger beer for Moscow Mules. The Irish Nachos came out with two teaspoons of meat. The Irish dip sandwich came out with literally two bites of meat. We asked for a real sandwich with more meat. Combining with the first joke of a sandwich they made one whole acceptable one. Maybe it was a bad day for The Kilt but on a home game Sunday, they should be on their A game. By the way, we were here at 2pm, which is 6 HOURS before game time."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and service wasn't that great. I went there after a concert for happy hour and their prices were pretty good. I definitely would have been upset if I payed full price for the small portions. It's not difficult being a waitress, but the girl who served us seemed to not get it. Every table around us was waiting on something and trying to get her attention. She'd check on one table, leave then come back for another table, making her workload seem a lot more stressful than if she would have just checked on every table at the same time. I asked her for waters for both myself and my friend and she took my glass then came back and asked my friend if she needed some. Apparently she could only do one thing at a time. Was more annoying than fun. Go to Twin Peaks around the corner instead, hot staff, better food and better service."}
{"text":"The service was terable and that includes the bus boys Do not go there! Worst place ever. The tits and ass can't save that place."}
{"text":"If I could do 0 stars I would. Took 45 minutes to bring 3 sandwiches when they weren't even busy. Then my appetizer that I was having as my meal came 25 minutes later. 2 of the orders were wrong and you can tell that food was left under a heat lamp for a while. There was no reason for the food to take as long as it did there was no food coming out of the kitchen prior to ours. It was ridiculous! I used to love this place but not anymore!"}
{"text":"Came here for a paint nite. Originally, it was planned for a different venue but got switched to Tilted Kilt.   Service: Good  Food was okay. Ordered the Appetizer sampler to share. Mozzarella sticks were good. Fried Pickles were okay. Boneless chicken wings were okay - nothing special. Just an average meal.   My main dislike are the outfits for their waitresses. I'm really not a huge fan of any restaurant that requires women to wear tiny skirts and put their breasts on display. I don't want to see that much cleavage or that many breasts as I eat. Don't think any pub or sports bar should require that of the women who work there.   If it wasn't for paint nite being moved here, I wouldn't go here. Only kept the date because I liked the painting I was going to paint.   Bathroom: This is a first for me. There's only 1 bathroom so you share it with the opposite sex. I don't mind-thought it appropriate for 2017.   Overall, I won't be going to the Tilted Kit again mainly due to the waitresses outfits - just not my style of bar I guess - and partially cuz the food was okay."}
{"text":"You don't come to Tilted Kilt for there food just like any other \"breastruant\" Ive tried a few things off the menu but nothing worth eating twice the drink specials are usually really good at this place which makes it worth going to. The scenery also isn't bad the waitresses outfits are also a bit more tasteful than hooters. Overall its worth checking out."}
{"text":"Came here to watch a UFC fights and was told there was no cover charge but still ended up getting charged the cover on my bill besides that I sat at the bar and was ignored by my waitress the whole night and the bar busser ended up getting me my drinks all night. Overall pretty disappointed in this spot since the location in Scottsdale is always on point and not to mention much more friendlier service."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving Tilted Kilt 3 stars is because I am a man, and men like sports, scantily clothed women, and alcohol.   The Tilted Kilt offers all of necessities to me as a man, and that's about it.  In reality, The Tilted Kilt is expensive, the service is iffy, and the food is slightly above average.   But, for a place to tailgate before a game, it can be very clutch. They have TV's everywhere and a lot to offer when it comes to Craft Beers. So when it's nice outside, and the Bucco's are attempting to raise the jolly roger, you might find me sitting at a table outside watching the game, drinking a Jameson and Ginger ale and/or a Belle's Oberon, and enjoying manly activities."}
{"text":"I like Hooters. Maybe that's what jades my opinion of this place... but I just really don't like the girl's outfits.  And I'm a lesbian!!  I just think it's too much skin to be appropriate... the girls at Hooters at least leave something to the imagination. Two stars for the outfits.  The food is pretty good... four stars for the food.  Drinks... 4 stars as well... they have great happy hour specials.  I had the pastrami sandwich and it was really good... huge sandwich... I took half of it home.  One thing that kinda weirded me out was when I went to the restroom... walk in and it smelled like it was a club night. The air was full of perfume... weird.  Then I finished up and there was a single woman's mary jane shoe... no doubt one of the server's shoes.  Just weird."}
{"text":"Having been to maybe 6-8 locations as a basis for comparison, I was truly disappointed with this one.  I come to TK for the food, the atmosphere, and the craft beer. Without any of these three things, it's just any old place to eat.   This is a great location with great foot traffic, dragged down by no craft beer, and a bored staff.  In the city known for its endless supply of beautiful women, TK managed to not hire a single one of them.  Many locations pride themselves on their connection to local craft breweries offering some of the best beers from local suppliers. I like to come to TKs then I travel to try the local beers in the lovely TK environment. This location missed this opportunity completely.  With two strikes against them, all that's left is the food. It was fine. Nothing extraordinary but fine.  As much as I really wanted to have a good time and enjoy this location; it wasn't possible given it's obvious shortcomings.  I can't recommend this location. Try harder and I might try it again the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"This place used to be a lot of fun when it first opened and the quality of ladies were better. That's no offense to how it is now, just liked it better a few years ago. Food still tastes the same (nothing bad, nothing amazing) but still a nice bar to go to for a drink or two"}
{"text":"Is it possible to leave zero stars? Worst service ever. It took an hour to get a microwave Pretzel.. That was defrosted and still freezing cold. Unapologetic service from the manager. Terrible."}
{"text":"Eh, Irish Pub is used loosely here.  If you want a chain bar to go and have some happy hour, especially with a large crowd, this place is fine.  If you are looking for a more realistic Irish feel, this is not going to be it.  It's got hot, scantily dressed waitresses, and a decent beer menu.  Over all, it's not my favorite place, but it's ok for a post work get together when people can't decide."}
{"text":"Walking in it was clean. We went during the day it was pretty dead.  Hubs got a buffalo chicken sandwich  I got Mozzarella sticks Friend got bacon burger.  The overall food was ok. Not like Amazing. The waitresses seemed to be a bit pre occupied with taking selfies and creating a human pyramid versus taking care of us.  The place just seemed to lack management and the proper scheduling there was like 15 girls to 5 customers/tables. Way over staffed for the time. But what Evs would I go back probably not."}
{"text":"We went to tilted kilt recently on a Friday night. Our server was Mariya. She had a wonderful smile and great personality. Our drinks were constantly full, our order was brought to us promptly. I had the Gaelic chicken, hubby ordered a burger. The food was fresh and hot. Overall I would go back and definitely request Mariya she is one of the best waitresses I've ever had."}
{"text":"The cheap thrills of Hooters in a much cooler environment with much better food.  Went for lunch with 6 men that I'm working with as the only girl.  Opted for the chicken tender wrap, \"tilted\", with blue cheese instead of ranch.  The wrap was pretty good, though I should have asked for the blue cheese on the side.  The fries were excellent - crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  My objective female opinion is that the uniforms for the girls here are far more flattering than those heinous \"flesh\" colored tights and bright orange running shorts that the Hooters girls have to wear.   As for the pub part, one of the group said it best - \"We should have come for happy hour instead of lunch.\"  That's what I'm going to recommend the next time the vendors suggest this place for lunch.  I've never minded establishments such as this when I've got a nice cold beverage in hand."}
{"text":"For having a \"normal\" experience at one of the other locations, this one was great.  I do believe that the layout of this location is EXCELLENT.  The massive TVs are a HUGE plus.  I was totally diggin' that at my bar seat, the TVs were the PERFECT distance from my eyes where it didn't blind me.  It was awesome!  Another thing... GET THE DRUNKEN CLAMS.  I swear, I wanted to drink the broth after I was done.  There were a ton of clams and it was just great.  I also got the Gaelic Chicken... OMG.   I absolutely hate saying \"OMG\" but OMG.  Get it.  If you like chicken, onions, mushrooms, mashed 'taters and an excellent sauce to top it all... GET IT.  The waitress was real nice and cute little thing too. Alana... I liked that she put her name on our little drink coasters.  That's how I remember her name."}
{"text":"This place is great. and the food is excellent , whats even better is that i can walk there from my house..........Love it Thx. Kilt"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken tender wrap tossed in signature Tilted Kilt's Sweet n Spicy sauce.  Just ok.  Not enough signature sauce.  Very good service.  Crowded and vibrant before Fri eve Suns game"}
{"text":"This is my second time at Tilted Kilt at The LINQ and I must say both times the food has been excellent! I've tried their fish tacos and now their chicken wings with chips and salsa. We ordered a side of their beer cheese sauce that pairs well with Chips, French fries or pretzel sticks. It's definitely a sports bar kind of place so it can get pretty noisy but if you're interested in watching sports while you eat they have them all over the restaurant so you'll have a good view for that. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Tilted Kilt is definitely your boyfriend's favorite restaurant. Now, what you like most your about your boyfriend isn't his simple-minded misogyny, which allows places like this to exist, nor is your favorite thing about him his preference to be served by soft-core strippers in a tacky themed restaurant; rather, what you like most about your boyfriend is that he's just \"one of the guys,\" a \"man's man\" if you will, who engages in traditional masculine acts, including, but not limited to: donning cargo shorts, \"hanging out\" with his \"bros,\" drinking Miller Lite, and, of course, going to The Tilted Kilt on a regular basis.   Your girlfriends have been worried about you since you've started dating your boyfriend, who, by the way, you definitely want to marry and spend the rest of your life with. While it's true you do feel a little lonely after the fourth \"guys' night\" of the week, you assure your girlfriends that you've had \"the talk\" with your boyfriend and determined that it's just \"harmless fun.\" \"It's not about the boobs,\" he said, and you believe him, because again, he is your boyfriend, who you definitely love, and with that love comes an unquestionable, undeserving trust, \"...they have tons of TVs for my sports and they also have...food.\" Plus, both you and your boyfriend agree that your girlfriends are \"way too uptight.\"   And when your boyfriend does come home, though often late and drunk, he's coming home to YOU. And that's what really matters."}
{"text":"Walk in and to be told there is a wait while we see empty table and seats?? On a night to see the World Series game they should be sitting down people quick to make money instead there pulling the whole \"it's reserved\" crap. The girls here have horrible customer service and the whole staff is useless. I chose to come here because i live right next to the apartments and it's very convenient to walk to but with the bad service today I think I'll take my business to zipps better."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents, hubby and kiddo for St. Patty's day.  I had THE best corned beef sandwich I have ever had.  My Dad loved the corned beef hash, and my Mom & hubby were so pleased with the corned beef & cabbage they wish it was on the menu as a permanent item.  Kid had mac n cheese, as she is wont to do, and as always had the best time chatting with our servers about whatever was on her mind."}
{"text":"Ummm, not sure what to think.  I'll give them a B for effort, a real Irish bar it is not but you know that.  Then there's that comparison to Hooter's.... um, no.    From what I do remember from that night is that I had an insane amount of Car Bomb's (Tilted calls them something else on the menu.  Why?)  Hey, I wasn't paying for them.  Service was good, they did a good job to keep the inebriation train a rollin'.  Relax, none of us were driving.  Walking back to the hotel was fun though.  I also seem to recall that they did last call at 10pm... really?  Oh, I see why, they use Michael Collins instead of Jameson's... very nice."}
{"text":"This place is so accommodating that they allowed our meet-up group to watch the Victoria's Secret fashion show on the big screen last night! Talk about service. The service was also spot on. I ate before I arrived, so didn't eat there...but my friends did and the food looked fresh and delicious! They have 2 pool tables (lack of brush to clean off all the debris on the pool table prevented me from giving them 5 stars), tons of TV and lots of room.   We had the only table with females, which was typical for this type of bar i guess. The servers were dressed in stuff that may have been seen on the VS fashion show!   The prices are very reasonable too! Will definitely be back for the food ^_~"}
{"text":"Tilted Kilt is just one of those places where you know what you're getting into. It's that simple in my opinion, and that's why I say it's A-OK. I've had to be a patron of this particular TK recently because it is one of the few restaurants downtown that can handle a large group, which is a shame. That said, the food isn't awful, and the beer is kept flowing. So, if you're going for the purpose of hanging out with a group, it's not the worst option out there.  The food is okay, the service can be hit or miss, and the beer selection isn't that bad. This location is definitely one of the better TK's out there, so go...as long as you know what you're going there for. And yes, I'm talking to you, critical foodie. ;)"}
{"text":"This is a cool place along the Pittsburgh waterfront. However their food and service leave a lot to be desired.  If you are here for a football weekend, stay away from the food cooked on the grill. They like to spray lighter fluid all over the hamburgers while they cook them.  You maybe a fan of gasoline On your food but I am not."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming back to this place but after Monday night I am finished. After being seated at the \"Island\", it took almost a solid 15 minutes for my server to arrive, despite walking back and forth between in front of me. When she did come over the service was subpar. The food has always been mediocre and it was again on Monday. I am done with this place."}
{"text":"Went with a big party saturday night and the service was terrible. I only seen the waitress twice and waited over 30 min for fries.  Main thing was bad service and she couldn't figire how to keep checks separate.  Next day i find out my card was charged 3x the amount of what was onmy receipt. Went to bank to dispute charge to only find out my card was charged again for another ridiculous amount. Waiting for things to clear due to columbus day. Im not looking forward on having to make another trip down there.   As of right now i will not be returning other than to get my money back on what they over charged on my card."}
{"text":"Awesome wings!! Love the food and the service is awesome too! Soo yummy! I also had the spinach salad and the flat breads. The butchers block is always great for people wanting meat, And the chicken flatbread is great too! Had the skinny margarita, also awesome!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Ordered the spicey fish tacos. Taste was good..maybe need a lil bit more fish but overall a nice ordered...especially since it was not listed on the menu..the batata fries were just right...and what can be said but nice things about the *scenery*"}
{"text":"I confess, everything I heard or read about this place really made me nervous.  But I saw a Groupon-type deal last year and weighed the pros and cons:   Pros: It's on the North Shore (where I was quite often last year for Pirates games), the menu looked good, the Groupon-type deal might make it worth it  Cons: It's the Irish Hooters, service might suck, service might be slow if it's busy  I decided I could suffer through what might be a disappointing dining experience in an effort to mix things up from my usual game day meal of hot dogs and nachos at PNC Park.  I could not have had lower expectations going in.  I was so nervous to try it in fact that my gift certificate was near expiring when I finally used it.  And I was pleasantly surprised.  It might be because I sat at the bar and not at a table.  But if that is the case, then the bar is the place to be.  I was greeted immediately and all my needs (refills, extra napkins, to go order) were filled with efficiency.  The bartenders were friendly and engaging, and not in that annoying way like they're working for tips.  And they were not all women.  The bartenders were both men and women so I didn't have to worry about too many boobies.  It was not too busy when I got there but did get more crowded as I left.  I ordered Maggie Mae's Fish and Chips.  It was good pub fare that came out of the kitchen quickly.  So quickly that I think the bartender may have grabbed someone else's order by mistake.  But I wasn't complaining.  I also ordered Fat Bastard's Meatloaf Sandwich with garlic mashed potatoes to go because I was by myself and wanted to use the full value of the gift certificate.  It was perfect when I enjoyed it for lunch then next day.    I can understand what some other Yelp reviewers have said.  But boobies aside, the service and attention was way above par and the food was good in my experience.  I would not hesitate to go back (and sit at the bar).  Let's go Bucs!"}
{"text":"Love the new area this place is in, the Quad area right by the super huge Ferris wheel. There's a long walkway with a bunch of shops and restaurants. Tilted kilt is in there. This sports bar is cool because of all the numerous tv's. You can basically watch any sport in here! If it's not on one of the screens, ask them to change!  One of the managers, ivory, hooked us up this past Thursday night! We called beforehand and he reserved a large table for us and had the Dodger/Angel game (as requested) on several tv's around that table. We had a party of ten and it worked out great!  Bathrooms are upstairs near the entrance and the upstairs area was cool too. Had tv's around a bar like sitting area up there. Nobody was sitting up there but you could have some privacy if you wanted to. But no bartenders or servers up there I don't think. At least I didn't see any. A fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"The star is for the service, since it was quick and friendly on the most part. Though the attire of the waitresses was a little much.  The food and drink was overpriced and uninteresting, I wouldn't recommend it.  18.5% auto gratuity was added even though were were just a table of 4 and got separate bills, we weren't told though and only noticed it on our bills later so we each tipped extra on top of a tip we had already paid."}
{"text":"Great service. Bartenders are all fun and attentive. Great variety of ice cold brews and the Irish stew in phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my family and I are regular here. We love stopping in for some grub and a few drinks. We'l almost always sit in the bar side and never really had issues. On Father's day, we went in to watch the World Cup on the big screen on the restaurant side. Soon into the start of the game, the middle tv of the big screen stops working. Seriously!?! Nothing was done to fix it. Obviously it's probably not an easy fix. But from the sounds of it, it's been having issues for a while. Im sorry, but you're a sports bar known to televise big sporting events. You need to keep your TVs, especially the big one working. I felt bad for the big group who took the couches right in front because they ended up having to turn their necks to watch it on one of the smaller tvs. Please get that fixed! Im sure your establishment can afford to get that fixed if you haven't already. I don't want to chance it and go in and have that happen again for another big match."}
{"text":"Worse place to come for a drink.  After waiting for 30 min for the server to Brng us our drink   We had to go speak with the manager in order to get it."}
{"text":"I just left the tilted kilt.. We came in after a concert.. Our waitress SUCKED.. However the manager Patrick was amazing. I was charged for drinks I didn't have.. No one brought us boxes and we were PISSED. But Patrick was amazing. Super apologetic, friendly and accommodated us immediately. He was very sweet and made sure we left happy. They are lucky to have him!!! All of the tables seemed to have problems and Patrick was handling everyone.. Once we left I gave him a tip (which he refused repeatedly) and he gave me a hug, his parting words were \" just trying to keep cool\" just an over all NICE GUY. Amazing at his job.. P.s  Angela.. Please quit."}
{"text":"Ok service and the wings tasted good . Also lots of selection on beer. The only thing is a few of the girls are rude an the manager constantly looks like she is in a bad mood."}
{"text":"We came here to watch a UFC match (Randa Rousey vs Amanda Nunes). I was quite happy to find this sports bar in Richmond Hill because now I don't have to drive 20+ minutes just to watch a game. Establishment is quite spacey, plenty of TVs, comfy booths, energetic atmosphere, and friendly service.  The waitresses looked nothing like the posted photos. Man I keep getting catfished. Check out instagram.com/tiltedkilt_richmondhill for more accurate photos.  Food wise this place is not vegan friendly. I was a bit disappointed to find out that their \"skinny arse\" veggie burger has egg white. Would be nice if they veganized it. I guess it's beer, french fries, and a garden salad for me as usual.  With all that said, this is a great sports bar. Perfect for those who want sit down on a comfy booth and watch a match on a massive TV while snacking & drinking beer."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab a drink before and event. However, the food here is terrible. Ordered a burger medium, came out well done. Heading to the baseball game so I didn't have time to send it back.  On a separate occasion, ordered chicken that did not taste right. Had to send that back and get something else as it was no cooked properly.  Stay away from the food here. They obviously can't get it right."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great service - if you don't mind scantily clad chicks serving you."}
{"text":"I did enjoy this place it was kind of rowdy but fun. The waitress go out of there way to help the custmores. There very friendly there.....Its cool place the food is def worth the price you pay...Id go here agian...It  was a good place ha ha ha The kilt girls were nice they smiled at you and made sure everything was okay with your order and checked on you every now and then..Thats good....I liked it overall"}
{"text":"Waited 10 mins for first beer refill now I'm on 5 mins for my second. 2 bartenders 1 bar back, no manager in site...FACE PALM ? they keep looking at my drink that's empty and say nothing. I don't care about the girls or the outfits I want sports and drinks. Go somewhere else for $9 vodkas."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the numerous good quality TVs.  The rest of the lost stars are for everything else that matters.  FYI - just because you have 2 dozen draft beers, doesn't, in itself, mean you have a good selection.  Do some research."}
{"text":"How did I end up here?  I must rethink everything.  I blame a group quorum of \"I have heard about the place and never been\".   Well I have never had my liver stolen after a night of drinking in Hong Kong but I was somehow able to avoid it.  Where do I start.  The staff. They want to do their job but seriously they know the food sucks and the place is awful.  You have been warned."}
{"text":"I don't often write reviews but this had to be said, While in Vegas with a large group of friends we ventured in to the Tilted Kilt after walking around Vegas for hours. We were all very tired and hungry. The Waitress Danielle greeted us and engaged us in conversation. She made food recommendations and truly took us from Fatigue to laughter. It no longer felt like a quick pit stop for some food to a great time , being entertained. We had wonderful food, fantastic service and just had the very best time. Everyone in our party loved Danielle so much. the table next to us said the same thing as we became one big party together. Because of her we came the next day too, for drinks. We asked for her and stayed long enough that drinks turned into dinner. The Tilted Kilt is a really nice sports bar. Danielle made our night an Event. We will ask for her everytime we are in las Vegas now. What a great time. Love the kilt. Can`t wait to go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in tonight ,around 430 pm, I thought they were closed . Two employees BSing among themselves . This is a bad sign ,  I called off my co workers , we went to the burger place across the street instead . All 12 of us had a great meal ."}
{"text":"Grilled wings were great . Cold beer , happy hour pricing . Quick service . Great dinner"}
{"text":"I am curious as to why this location is slower than the others that I have been to. The food is on par with the other Tilted Kilts, the service its the same average service.  Anyway, I enjoy eating here. The Fish and Chips are good, the Black & Blue burger is a fav."}
{"text":"Went in Halloween night, got a table right away, ordered nachos, seriously, had to dig for the meat, people wake up!  There is no excuse for bad food except laziness. Throw some chips on a plate, no one will notice the lack of food. Server was nice, but I won't be back.   I should have read the comments from others. Tilted, you need to step up your game."}
{"text":"I went to Tilted Kilt on a Monday night expecting to have to fight for a seat due to Monday Night Football.  I was shocked to see that there were only about 5 tables full in the whole restaurant.  Overall - very good service, good cold beer, pretty crappy food.  I ordered an app of onion rings (quite good) and 10 wings.  I don't remember the name of the sauce I got (but it was the hottest one) and I was just not impressed.  Weird sweet flavor and very little heat.  I honestly would stop here again just for the beer and service, but that's about it."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, little pricy. Definitely a guy's place though. Could hardly look at my practically nude waitress, wouldn't bring the kids here."}
{"text":"Jamie was amazing today and provided great customer service and a great positive vibe. Also her food recommendation was great for our group."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a dbacks game with some friends.  The place was packed as a UFC fight was on.  But after 15 min we got a table for our group.  We enjoyed some drink and apps and everyone had a great time.  Lots of TV's so this would be a great place to watch sports."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to play pool!  Great food, great beer (when I still drank haha) and great people.  My favorite server Lixuan is a sweet personable woman who's very attentive and knows the menu very well.  She's always ready with a great suggestion when I don't know what I'm hungry for.  As long as Lixuan is working there I will continue eating and playing pool there."}
{"text":"Where do I start... First I was told to check this out from a friend when I asked about watching a UFC fight.. What a mistake and here's why...  1.  The bartenders are probably the most rude bartenders I have ever met. 2.  The food is way way over priced and tasted bland and old. 3   The television placement is horrible and the seats hurt your back after 30 minutes.  Most UFC fights are at least 2.5 hours.. 4.  Did I mention the wait staff was just as rude as the bartenders.   5.  The bartenders were more interested in getting back rubs from a guy who appeared to be the drunk regular then asking if I needed anything.  It took them 27 minutes to come back and ask if I needed anything.   6.  The place was 70% empty on a Saturday night and the people who were there were middle aged guys who were bent and determined to figure out how to cheat on their wives with the staff. 7.  While I did not realize that the place was a \"Hooters\" type of place (Honestly I am really not trying to be mean) The staff honestly looked like they were right out of Honey Boo Boo.. Seriously, if you need to have half naked women serving you food just go to Hooters, at least the Hooters staff isn't white trash.  Having a pregnant server 3/4 naked walking past me every 3 minutes was horrible.  The thought that came to my mind was that Tilted Kilt is the place that girls that are rejected from Hooters work... Never again..."}
{"text":"This place is my football home - I moved downtown at the start of football season and have watched most Cardinals games here, and some ASU and UA games as well.  Good food, lots of TVs, and plenty of friendly people."}
{"text":"Do not go here! There are so many other great spots around this area. I was with a group of people and we were starving, and there was no wait. We should have known by that sign alone. Ordered a few appetizers, and the first round they brought us was wrong, second one was missing things still. Wings were dry, not very flavorful. Nachos hardly had any toppings or meat on them. I had the chicken pasta and that was bland as well. Save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere...Two stars for no wait"}
{"text":"We were unable to get seated with a party of 14 they stated they could not accommodate very disappointed, we opted to go to go to Riverton brewery!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for a chain resteraunt. The food is good, and the selection of beers is okay, I hear that the owner has been listening to the advice of the Charlotte Beer Club and will be devoting more of thier taps to craft. Being a chain they obviously have to carry a few taps dedicated to BMC swill, but around half of thier 20 taps are decent craft beer.  This place actually won Stone Brewing Companies \"Most arrogant bar\" contest for selling the most arrogant bastard/oaked arrogant bastard/double bastard during the one week contest period.   I would definately reccomend this place Be careful though, the waitresses are a bit scantily clad (not that I mind)...the wife/kids may not appreciate the scenery as much as us men. kind of like a Hooters, but the girls are wearing kilts, plus the food is a little better than a Hooters. The downside is that I think they are a little pricey for the selection, and the lunch rush will leave you waiting for 20-30 minutes sometimes."}
{"text":"Cute girls, very friendly and prompt service in a clean, new location. Appetizer of pretzels with beer cheese was VERY good!. Then things went south... The ice water tasted like they grabbed it out of the street gutter and had a cement taste. Couldn't even drink it. My husband had the burger and garlic fries which he said was good. Not great but good. I had the fish tacos and chips. The fish was broiled and had a freezer taste and was tough. There was only salsa on the fish with one lime wedge. The chips were stale so I told the server. She mentioned that the kitchen staff is new. Sadly, if this place pays a tiny bit of attention to the quality of food, they will draw more women. The place was PACKED and I was one of 2 women in there. Those server girls were so sweet and tried so hard but their product is just not good.  I have no problem with their outfits as long as the food is edible."}
{"text":"It's a chain so the food and drinks are pretty standard.  Blonde is definitely a prevalent color here, and that never hurts.  Huge tv's all around are also a definite plus.    Do it.  You'll like it."}
{"text":"The service was great, servers were friendly, pretty good selection of beers, food was decent and reasonably priced. Was glad to see a token cute guy in a kilt. ;) We'll be back."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened, but almost all of the local beers are gone except OMB Copper.  Yes they have the more popular crafts like Fat Tire and Sam Adams, but no more Four Friends or Skull Coast.  Comparably speaking, it's a pretty week selection now.  The food is still decent, and so is the view,  but bring back the local brew.  New happy hour (1/2 price apps) on Wednesday and Friday from 4-7 and ladies night Thursdays though."}
{"text":"Ok so this resturant had my last review removed by yelp somehow. Yelp says it was because my review didnt convey a customer experience. Here is my experience, they refused to serve us because my girlfriend was wearing a bikini style top. She had more clothes on than the waitresses. So we had a bad customer expierence."}
{"text":"As soon as I opened the door, I felt like I was in a sports bar more than a pub. It's quite spacious and has an open atmosphere, and there are a ton of nice televisions. The TVs are so plentiful that no matter where you sit, you should have a good view of just about any game that's airing. I kinda dig the decor, everything consists of nice wood paneling or wallpaper in green hues, but it certainly feels more like a commercial chain than a local pub.   I had the \"French Connection\" burger with garlic fries, and I got to admit I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Not the best burger I've had by far, but it was definitely tasty. And the garlic fries were pretty good too. My buddies got the club and bbq sandwiches and they had similar results as me. We went a little after 2pm and it wasn't very busy, but it still took a little long to get our food.  Our service was good, our waitress came by several times and checked on us and kept our drinks filled. She made several attempts at small talk, I could tell she was just trying to be nice, but I could see that she was also fishing for big tip. It's already been said, but their attire is very revealing, more so than Hooters. At Hooters the ladies don't show cleavage, and here everyone wears very low cut tops. And truthfully it was kind of creepy to me that half of the patronage consisted of older men who were awkwardly staring at the staff, but that's a knock against the customer's more than it is the restaurant. I just wouldn't feel very comfortable taking my younger nephews or nieces here.  The only time I could recommend the Tilted Kilt is if you're going to watch a game with a bunch of guys. The food is surprisingly good, but it is overpriced. You can get similar food for cheaper, and with quicker service at half a dozen other places in Matthews. But let's be honest, if you're going to the Tilted Kilt odds are the food isn't the only reason you're going."}

{"text":"We had a Groupon so we decided to check out the restaurant in Paradise Valley.  They had a lunch special menu with a $3 off any item on that menu.  We ordered 3 dishes from the menu and they allow the groupon to be used with the special menu.    We tried the fish and chips which were really good...3 pieces of cod with french fries for $12.  The fried fish was moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside...perfect.  Would have rated them a 4 but there service was slow."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fun,  right in the heart of all the Casino excitement.  At least 50 flat screens with The Cleveland Indians, golf, hockey, boxing you name it playing for your viewing pleasure. Friendly service. Irish Dip  was delicious garlic fries were good but messy and the drinks were cold.  When we did a check in thru YELP we received a free appetizer of  Irish nachos, nice surprise! Reasonably priced food. We will return!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and it came out pretty quick was hot and tasty, but the service was terrible which is why am only giving us three stars. I probably will never come back to this place again given that the service was so bad. The place was less than half empty and I got one drink with no refills unacceptable. They added an 18% gratuity on to my bill as well...seems like a little bit of a rip off given that you can add an additional tip in there they don't tell you that. Only three stars wish I could've been more."}
{"text":"Saturday evening dinner with wife and somehow ended up here! Served by Clara who was very attentive and friendly. Fun for me and my wife still felt very comfortable here too.    Now the food... Started with the onion rings which were average, not great. Then the Irish Dip sandwich which was VERY GOOD. The au jus was some of the best I've had. Then the reason to go back... Tilted Guilt macadamia nut cookie and ice cream desert! Just wow!!     Also the floor manager Katelynn went out of her way to be sure all was right and enjoyed our meal.    All in all we found that there is no reason to wait over an hour plus for the place down the block."}
{"text":"the service sucks, i literally had to ask for a refill, our waitress was more focused on her hair then our service. & the food was cold. obviously people go for the girls looks instead of the food & service is."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Tilted Kilt at 6pm on a Friday night. We were with a group of 25+ (#evfn) but we'd arrived earlier than most. There were only 3 others there when we arrived. The place is small and has as many tables crammed in there as possible and there is so much noise you cannot have a conversation with the person next to you unless you either yell or speak directly in their ear. I suppose if you were on a date where you wanted to be really close to the person all night without being obvious, this would be a good place to do it. \"I'm sorry that my face is all up in yours, but I want to be sure you can hear me!\"  Keep in mind though, it won't continue to be very romantic (not that you'd really expect a bar like this to be anyway) if you are at a table in the middle of the room because you will constantly have people walking behind you or pulling their chairs in and out and ramming into you. It's a small place and it's really busy on Friday night.   The waitresses are cute and half... er... two-thirds naked and they look good this way. I suppose. At first glance you'd assume they are hired completely based on their appearance and while they don't seem like Harvard Scholars, they appear to be more than capable of running around and getting the job done. In our large group I didn't notice anyone receiving incorrect meals, but one friend did receive someone else's bill and had to have that corrected, which I believe it was even though there was definitely some waiting involved due to our having one waitress for our entire table of separate tickets. Can't complain.  The free nachos they brought our group were \"OK\" - not worth whatever price they normally charge. The prices are pretty standard and I didn't notice much of a deal with the happy hour drinks. I had a buffalo chicken wrap which was actually pretty yummy and their french fries were plentiful and delicious.   And one last note about our waitress - she was patient and friendly no matter what the situation was. She kept smiling and never stopped moving and never showed any signs of stress under pressure. Kudos to her. (Jenna, I believe was her name)  Oh and final note - the parking stinks on Friday night and I couldn't get their free wi-fi to work."}
{"text":"Maybe it's weird that I am a girl. But I like this bar. The service is always spot on. The staff is friendly and the beer is good and cold. Has a good happy hour menu and it may be swamped with guys but I still like the Tilted Kilt for the fact that you know what your getting!"}
{"text":"just had a drink.  Good place to watch sports....tvs everywhere.  Waitresses are cute, but dippy.  Ordered a bloody mary and didn't get what it had described...forgot the bay seasoning rim and the olive.  Just got lemon skewer.  There were 4 people in there...not like they were very busy....maybe they are not use to making mixed drinks...known for beer???  Left after that."}
{"text":"This was my first time to a Tilted Kilt and it was awful. I had this image of this chain as hot chicks and descent food. Um...no and no. Nasty meth looking skanks and shitty food. I already felt dirty enough from being on the west side but being at this place made me want to take a bleach bath. Since I dont drive a monster truck with balls or look like I just got back from a sand rail/quad event, I was out of place. I ordered somesort of draft beer and it was delish, but that's not saying much since you can't F that up. I also ordered the calamari and ew! If you like very little squid loaded with grittle then this is your dish. After 20 minutes here I was looking for a way out. If you end up here, all I can say is good luck!"}
{"text":"Game day. 4 bartenders. 2 waitresses on patio. 100s+ people. Waited 45 min and no service. Had to get our own food/drinks from the bar. They don't serve fries for patio guests. Only chips. Terrible service. Cold and stale food. Warm drinks."}
{"text":"I give places the benefit of the doubt but the bad reviews are accurate. Our waitress brought out two drinks no one ordered and since she couldn't take them back left them. Okay mistakes happen. Then she brought out two of the wrong burgers and had to leave them as well. Seems like such a waste. we boxed them up for two homeless gentlemen we saw outside. It took forever to get anything you needed. Our waitress disappeared so much and they weren't even busy. I'm not a picky eater but the chips there were pretty bad. I didn't know you could screw up Chips and salsa. Someone else in our party ordered Irish nachos and there was no sauce just a handful of diced tomatoes and ground beef. The sauce finally came out when it was cold. Some of the pretzel apps came with two sauces and some only came with one. When someone asked the waitress why she didn't get mustard sauce she paused and said they don't serve it anymore. When two other people had it sitting on theirs. Some of us had seasoning on our fries which was actually pretty good and some didn't. Weird experience. We did have a slightly large group but come on you're a Pittsburgh location and I'm sure you're packed on game days. Two waitresses tried to seat their party at the same table next to us then argued who was supposed to sit there. The one then left the party that didn't get the table and walked away and they yelled after her asking where they should go and she didn't hear them. They were pretty upset. Seems service is pretty bad. This place needs help sorry not sorry. Listen to the reviews guys cause I didn't (I also didn't choose the place but oh well)"}
{"text":"Menu was limited and serve was slow. Seen why on the way out. She was spending a lot of time at one table with a guy. Food was okay tho."}
{"text":"If there was halves I'd give this place 2-1/2 stars. Bar is in a great location, elevated on the second level in the downtown area. Outside bar is even better but they call this place a sports bar for a reason. Food is not the best by any means. I ordered a burger and it was okay.  Waitress had recommended the sweet potato fries to me and they were nothing special.    Overall, this is a good sports bar with mediocre food.  TV's are located throughout so you are bound to find whatever team you are rooting for!  Also, the men servers in a kilt is a little weird to look at so be prepared!!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends of mine because last time I was here I had some drinks but did not eat. But the food looked wonderful. So today I took my friends out from work and this place is delicious food was amazing great environment Great service!!!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in the customer service. The waitresses were rude and left us with no drinks and took almost 30 minutes just to take our order. We had to walk out and they never even asked us why. Will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"I know being a girl this may seem biased, but this food was terrible.  I work in construction and went in with about 20 upper management guys and myself ( I am management). I have a good sense of humor and can hang with the best of them, I go to places all the time with barely clad girls due to the industry I work in... The table I was sitting at hardly touched their food and they were not at all impressed with the \"atmosphere\".   I can see where the draw is....I was not at all impressed either were most of the guys I was with. The talent was not that great. I would say C-team. Our waitress was not all that intelligent either, she messd up our order and we had to remind her to get our drinks..."}
{"text":"Nice play with some great views, was in town on Business from Minnesota so coming from 0 degrees to 74 was nice so sat on the outside side of the bar which had a great view, nice weather, and they had heaters which of course was too hot for me since I am used to Artic temps.  Attentive Bartenders, had the Kick Arse Quesa Dip which was good and very spicy, not the greatest only because I prefer the Quesa Dip not so thick but still good.   Oh and the staff were all in Skirts even the guys, kinda cool place though!"}
{"text":"Our server was great! Some guy brought out food and we asked for ranch with our fries and never got it. I was watching the hockey game and a guy didn't even change the channel he turned the tv off I was watching. Then for 45 mins he kept looking at his phone, not busing tables or bringing out food. Don't tell me he was on break either. I would never allow my servers to be on the floor playing on their phones. ***I was just informed this is their manager. Unbelievable tilted kilt! Please reeducate management on behavior while on the floor!!"}
{"text":"My food was cold didn't really get a chance to enjoy it. The waitresses we're nice  Food just wasn't what I expected. The wings didn't jump off my pallette"}
{"text":"Really really disappointed. Went here w my wife on a date night away from kids.  Ordered two drinks, sat down, The lights turned on and the TVs were turned off. I complained as they had just given us drinks. With no notice about closing. I'm sure owner wouldn't be happy if he walked into a bar on a weekend like this."}
{"text":"I swear I've written a review on this place but I could be wrong. We had a groupon and decided to venture out to the area. Unknown to us until we looked at the menu it was shortened. This was due to a game that day. That upset the other half because they didn't have what he wanted on the shortened menu. With that said the service was good and the food was piping hot and fresh. So much so that my son had to wait a bit to eat his fish and chips so they could cool down enough that he could eat it. I'm not complaining about this. I would take fresh hot food over cold sitting around food any day. I think the outfits are cute and the girls loved my boy. This wouldn't be my first choice in the area for a dinner but it was a nice meal and the service was good."}
{"text":"The new management has completely turned this place around in the last year. The customer service during this visit was on point. Our waitress, Courtney, was attentive from the moment we walked it. She was friendly, accurate and quick to fill all our orders.   I look forward to going back next week for snacks and Sooner football."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Disappointing food. Huge waste of almost 2 hours.   We stopped in this afternoon for lunch and to catch up with a buddy.  He arrived 10 min before us so I was quite surprised to see he didn't have a beer in front of him, we received our drinks and still he waited. It took OVER 20 MINUTES for him to get his Miller Light, there was no apology, no suggestion for a bottle or a different beer. We just sat there, being ignored.   It took forever for us to actually get her attention long enough to place our order as well.  The only good thing about our experience was the spinach and artichoke dip we had as an appetizer (it was actually really good, but not good enough to bump my review from 1 star).  My buddy, who was quite depressed about the NASCAR race being delayed obviously needed another beer to drown his redneck sorrows but despite telling our server, the beer never came so he went up to the bar and asked the bartender to pour him one. After she poured it, she went and pulled the tickets of all the drinks she needed to pour. There were five tickets, clearly standing there staring at her nails was more important.   Finally our food came but we still didn't have silverware, (despite wanting some when our appetizer arrived). Since it's a little difficult to eat a salad without a fork... I immediately asked for one (again) along with more water. Now you'd think grabbing silverware would be on the top of her priority list, nope...chatting (by chatting, I mean flirting with her obnoxious fake laugh) with another table was obviously more important. After sitting there patiently waiting for a while, my buddy got up in search of a fork. One of the other servers brought the silverware over but slammed them on the table with one hell of an attitude. At this point, I'm so over this restaurant.   Then I bit into my chicken. It's very possible it was cooked yesterday, left under the heat lamp for a day then cut into strips when my order came back. I've had jerky that's been easier to chew!!  Finally our server came over to ask how everything was...well I still don't have my water and my bf would like more coke, but I'm not holding my breath.   We spent the whole time waiting and waiting for our server to do her job. It was ridiculous, at one point we started timing her...8 minutes for a refill is completely unacceptable!!   She's lucky I wasn't the one paying, there's no way she would have received the 20% tip my bf felt obligated to leave. She didn't deserve it. She was horrible, incompetent and lazy!   I will NEVER be back, not just to this location but the tilted kilt in general."}
{"text":"Good bar. Good service lots of screens to watch your favorite sporting event. I'd give it a better rating but the menu could use some work. Pretty much the same as other bars."}
{"text":"Decent pub food, but great views for Super Bowl!  Service needed to be a little better.  Beer wasn't too cold from the spout.  There were not too many options open during the time we went."}
{"text":"Food OK. Waitress very rude when tipped with some cash/some coins, which kind of ruined the experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunate,  I walked in tonight for a bite after a long day.  Slow night at the Kilt, it was fairly empty.  Was seated and thought I enjoy the World Series game. Sat for a bit and no bothered to check on me.   Not what I am accustomed to when visiting the Kilt in Southern California or Las Vegas.   Moving on..."}
{"text":"Was on vacation for a family function the weekend before Christmas.  Never even had heard of this place before but my cousin works here so I was at least interested in checking it out.  It reminded of a cooler version of Hooters.  Good food(garlic fries kicked major ass) and a different selection of booze.  They had awesome HD TV's all over the place.  My cousin hooked us up BIG time.  The hot little bartender even hooked our whole table up with free shots.  So yeah, I am a fan.  Can you blame me?   P.S. I guess I wouldn't be much of a guy if I didnt mention the outfits the workers were wearing.  Yeah, they are sexy.  That is all."}
{"text":"Very efficient service at this establishment. Food came quickly and was hot and fresh. Good music, people enjoying themselves...Lots of large HD tv's that provide exciting sports from all angles. Good looking girl servers everywhere, also great looking tilt boys ;). All around fun place to hang out with some friends and grab some cold beers and delicious food."}
{"text":"Ok, I went here for a quick beer and a burger because I'm a woman on business travel and my laptop and I have a long night of work ahead of us. I certainly didn't darken the door of this establishment for the \"ambiance\", I just wanted something to eat and this place was literally across the street from my hotel. The skinny bunny with the push-up bra poured me a beer and skipped away, never even bothering to offer a menu. I sat for about 10 mins and sipped my beer and stewed, then I put my credit card on the bar. I wasn't going to beg for the opportunity to order a mediocre burger. Another 10 minutes passed while the blonde with the nerd glasses pranced around the establishment talking up the guys behind the bar, gossiping with the other kilted bimbos, never again making eye contact with me. Finally one of the bartenders got the idea and tabbed me out (I seriously considered just leaving, but I didn't set out to commit low-level larceny for a single beer.) I felt like an ass-hat not leaving a tip, but dammit, she didn't even try. I'm a generous tipper especially when I'm on my client's dime. Tomorrow night I'll return to the Scotland Yard (next door) for my evening brew and eats. Totally sucks, I should have consulted the reviews before venturing out tonight."}
{"text":"Really wasn't that impressed with this place at all. Food was bland, and service was less than mediocre. The waitresses barely paid any attention to us and questioned what we wanted to have. She's roll her eyes every time we picked something she obviously disapproved of.   Also when it came to paying. The waitress drooped the bill on our table and never came back for it.  The tip machine also has a default of 20 dollars. Or other.  Just because the waitresses are dressed in bras and skirts so short I can practically see their kooch doesn't mean they deserve a 20 dollar tip.   Not to mention the patrons there were loud obnoxious and rowdy. The other employees didn't even bother calming them down. One actually brought in a whistle and would blow it as hard as the could randomly throughout our meal  Awful experience and by far the worst bar pub I've ever had the displeasure of going to"}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries and Inferno burger. Juicy, and just enough heat. Sweet crinkled potato fries were GREAT! Over a great pub experience. Just make sure you understand the atmosphere of a bar and it caters to the male libido for the most part."}
{"text":"In town for the Beyoncé Concert and where do you go to eat before partying all night?  Anywhere you can eat and drink that is close to Heinz Field...just steps away...so that's how we ended up here at the \"Hooters\" like establishment.    Now, I am not knocking either, but looking at the apple bottom of a waitress or bartender and having breast globes in my face while ordering is not quite my style.  Hey.. the fellas had kilts on but why did I not get the same show??? hmmmm can you say \"sexist\"?  Anyway, we were told it could be 30 min for food since they were swamped and after an hour...nothing! After 75 minutes, A-ok food.  The Philly Cheesesteak and Seasoned fries had a nice favor but, I lost my appetite.  The chicken tenders were crunchy and had a nice taste as well, but just not worth the wait.  Finally, The wrong bill for food we did not eat and drinks we never consumed.  SO, ladies and gentlemen, try it.  You might like it, but not on an event night at the stadium. Oh! There is also outside seating with a pit for burgers and hotdogs on the fly!"}
{"text":"Noon wends , no white wine, no red wine , 1/2 bottle of rose  No tonic  Having almost nekked waitresses does not help sell imaginary liquor  \"Scarred by\" or should it be \"scared of\" the food reviews so passed on the menu and crossed the road to Ox and Angelas"}
{"text":"For downtown (note preface), not bad, but look at what you have to compare it to.  So far before Indians games I've been able to walk right in and be seated without having to wait for a table.  Service is good, food is edible, drinks are wet.  Location is great next to the new casino and near the arena and stadium.  They've done a great job at taking the former, awful Fat Fish Blue and turned it into a respectable chain location for TK.  The interior fits their style perfectly.  They offer plenty of HDTVs with nearly every show in the sports world being showcased.  With my first server, I asked for a grilled chicken sandwich and received a wrap, no hard feelings, it was edible.  Second visit I was glad I didn't have the grilled chicken club, as the basil pesto mayo was not good on their club.  I'd return for service that could turn us around in an hour to return to work."}
{"text":"I'm never a fan of these brestaurants but this one makes up for it. And yes, I am a chick.   For starts, the girls are wearing uniforms that actually fit them. Nothing is popping out and almost touching my food/beer. Second, the girls are actually clean looking - not sporting the greasy or 'I just got out of bed and look at my nappy hair' look. The service was excellent. Quick, accurate and friendly without.. weird friendly.   Drink prices were fair even off happy hour and the nachos were great.  They actually layer the meat/cheese throughout which is so nice compared to most placed that just dump the flavor on top leaving you with nothing once you peel away the layer of 3 inch thick crap.  The rest of the food looked like regular bar food.   The patio is awesome, they even have a fire place and water/ fish pond thing. Total chill place except for the weird-eye-balley-men here.   We watched a couple walk in and sit across from us at the bar (it's like a square shape). The guy left to use the bathroom or something and this random eye-baller came up and proceeded to not only hit on the chick(who was not as hot as the waitresses) and proceeded to tell her how he was a Dr. and blah blah. Needless to say when the guy returned they almost got in a cat fight.  Sad part about it, Mr. Dr. was wearing holey Old navy t-shirt... That's Snottsdale for ya... $30k millionaires all over the place."}
{"text":"Good bar food and drinks. Attentive staff. I like the Irish nachos"}
{"text":"This is a great spot in downtown Phoenix. I get their Black and Blue burger almost every  time with their house made chips and it is a pretty tasty meal. They also have a pretty good beer selection, especially now that they have Four Peaks Hop Knot back. The bartenders there are great, especially Carl, Renee, and Kari. I would recommend sitting at the bar over a table. We have yet to have a good experience with a waitress there. They just tend to be slow and forget about you. Also, be prepared for the women's uniforms, they are a little bit revealing. Just something to know if you have kids."}
{"text":"1 Star is a compliment. This place is literally the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.   They forgot my buddy's meal, and when it came out 30 minutes later it was cold and not how he ordered it. Someone at our table spilled his drink and when we asked for a towel or napkins she completely blew us off. I had to go to the bar to get a towel and clean it up myself. On top of that, our waitress had a bad attitude and was generally unpleasant, and forgot literally ever single thing we asked for.   I will never come back here."}
{"text":"Friends and I sought a central location to watch this year's Stanley Cup finals. After a very negative experience at a similar establishment, we decided to try this location and I couldn't be happier that we did. The staff was exceptionally friendly, courteous, and accommodating, and even one evening when the venue was hosting a pay-per-view MMA event the same night as one of the games (that had a huge draw and was on almost all the screens), they still ensured we could watch the playoff game uninterrupted. The servers were very attentive, and although Happy Hour food specials are a bit limited, the food was decent and a reasonable value for the quality and amount."}
{"text":"Went to this location to watch an ASU game and just hang out with some friends. Ordered the blackened chicken flatbread and it was great. Just the right amount of spice so my nose didn't run. My favorite part was watching the more \"seasoned\" men stare and the waitresses with no shame. I will definitely be back to people watch and have some beers!"}
{"text":"Food is not very good, bad bar food. Helllllla TV's which is great when a million football games are on! The place was hot AF, can you turn the heater off please? Beers are good, lol. I suggest coming for football and beer only."}
{"text":"We were on vacation from California staying at the Westin Kierland Villas. We came here to watch the UFC fight and have dinner. Lots of TVs for easy viewing from every seat at our table. Food was good and service was great. The food came out hot, quick, and well prepared."}
{"text":"This place is just your regular bar with bar food and cute waitresses. Been here a few times and the service is on the slow side but every waitress we've ever had has been very friendly; helping to make up for slow service. I really enjoy the patio during the cooler months; a great place to end your day with a nice big Blue Moon."}
{"text":"The burger I ordered was the most bland and burnt I've had in a long time.    Customer service here is really lacking. Like forgetting drinks and water when requested. Or bringing cutlery out with the food.   Waitresses seem distracted here despite not being crazy busy. A little more focus would go a long way.   Would never be the person to suggest going back here"}
{"text":"Meh. Awesome beer, plus we had the hottest server so can't complain too much. Fried pickles were average, nachos were very much below average, toppings were very minimal...we picked on a few chips and left."}
{"text":"The service was prompt until our waitress had more tables than just ours. She was too busy taking care of the larger party of guys that came in and barely came back to us or the other 3 smaller tables by us.  Their special cocktail ran out of the key ingredient (it was a Friday before 6pm). Things didn't get too crazy yet to start running out of things for your signature drinks.    The pretzels were good but the fish and chips were mediocre...beer batter was generic. The Shepard's pie was highly disappointing, bland and more mash than anything else.   Music got really loud starting around 8pm, the DJ was doing his set. Way too loud for the restaurant area IMO.  I would not recommend this place to anyone, not even with the discount. The boobs (all squished and not evenly squished either! ) didn't even save this place, there are better sets in other restaurants in the Linq."}
{"text":"Tilted Kilt is awesome. Obviously the awesome girls help a lot, but the $3 Jack Daniels they have really makes it the best place for some drinks  with friends."}
{"text":"Worst service, food and beverage experience I've ever had.  We were told all drafts were unavailable and it turns out that only half were down.  They didn't have bottled beers listed on the menu.  It took 25+ minutes to get out drinks, all of the food came out wrong or didn't come at all.  The food that did arrive was horrible.  No one from our group will ever return."}
{"text":"Would give no stars if I could. Staff all seemed miserable, one of the worst happy hours I've gone to. Asked what drinks were apart of happy hour was told two different things. Two drinks cost $26 a purple haze and a sangria.  Drinks were watered down, and food was not good very bland and our pretzel came with a long black hair on it yummy. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in here tonight thinking, I'll shell out $40 on enjoying a little Happy Hour. Wow, saw your \"Under New Management\" sign...but did not expect that they would push a customer away.  Restaurant/Bar Rescue...do you work with Chains too!?  I went to the hostess stand, and asked if happy hour was only in the bar? She said no, everywhere throughout the restaurant too. I opted for non-bar. I also asked if there was food on the happy hour, oh yes of course was the response.  To start with a drink...I was chilled so thought some type of a hot drink would be a good start. Waitress, we don't have hot alcohol drinks...the only thing hot, coffee. Poor girl, never been to a bar before? Never been to an Irish bar? ...haha, oh wait. This is an Irish bar. I guess hot totties, Baileys, and other hot drinks are...Polish?  I didn't want to even explain because it was so embarrassing. So I went with coffee.   She also have me a menu...no happy hour menu. I inquired, can I get a happy hour food menu? She looked confused...um, yah I'll check on that.  She delivered the coffee. And then asked if I wanted food...as though the happy hour menu had never been discussed. Ha! My mind was blown...so I asked, did you get a chance to get me the happy hour food menu? Perplexed, she slowly responded...ya, we don't have anything like that.   I really didn't know what to say...so I said, I'll just stick with coffee. Boy oh boy...not sure what to say or think!  As I sit here enjoying my coffee (which is VERY good btw) I look around, and at 6:05pm...there are seriously 3 maybe 4 people in the entire place. I look across to The Outback Steakhouse reception area...standing room only. And on the other side of the restaurant is The Salty Sow...I KNOW that place is wall-to-wall right now, as it always is.   Crazy to me! But can't make this stuff up.   Tell you what Phoenix, if you wanted to try the Tilted Kilt...you need to hurry because they will be shutting their doors soon! Well, on the positive side...there's no wait."}
{"text":"Great food  Great service  Very clean place  Bathrooms r clean  Maddisen is a great hostess. She is very nice and polite and know how to treat a guest.   I recommend her to be your waitress. She knows what she's doing.And knows the menu very good. maddisen rocks!!!"}
{"text":"Why is it that the girls in Arizona all seem to wear skimpy clothes to work? Are they that in need of attention? Yikes.  We came here for dinner with some friends. Our bar drinks took over 10 minutes. The beef on our Irish nachos was cold as were the fries on all of our plates. All the girls just seemed to stand around and twirl their hair. Service was poor and I definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"This was a destination for lunch that turned into another visit before we left for a few beers and relaxing after a very long day... Lunch was cool, the place was fairly crowded with a good mix of young old and families. The second visit was on karaoke night. Although the staff was polite, there are people who protect their Karaoke very seriously even by a table full of people that are just looking for a beer.   \"The Good\" - The girls are cute dressed in Kilts and smile on occasion.  - The service was good. The sodas for lunch and the beers for the hang out night arrived at the table fast and we were checked on so we never needed anything... Pretty cool. - Lunch was decent. The kitchen was not slammed and the food arrived fast and just as we ordered it. There were just a few appetizers that were split around the table and arrived with no delay. - (By Default an observation on the Karaoke crowd) There were some great singers and some folks that were having a blast. The guy running it had some pipes and I even heard a guy sing \"on a Boat\" ... I had a blast. - TVs are everywhere. - Decent selection of Draft Beer. -Advertisements for UFC showings for the PPVs.   \"The Meh\" - There was nothing really meh to comment on.   \"The Bad\" - The outside area turned into the smoking area. Sadly, if you do not smoke you cannot enjoy the fresh air... irony people. - (By Default an observation on the Karaoke crowd)  There were some evil eyebrows from the local crew when someone sang Johnny Cash, and they were not from AZ. Still had a blast though ; )"}
{"text":"We had happy hour wings with tilted sauce,  buffalo chicken dip, garlic fries,black and blue burger, and fish n chips. Everything was good but the fish n chips we're soggy and flavorless.  Friendly staff, good atmosphere.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to eat here for a while and I'm disappointed that I did. The food was not the greatest, we got the sample platter with tilted flavor wings and that was good. The pickles were also pretty good, but the mozzarella sticks were hard, like they had only been cooked for a minute or so. I got a pulled pork for my entree and it was not pulled pork, it was chucks of park with so much sauce you couldn't manage to eat it as a sandwich. We sat on the patio, but people from inside were coming outside to smoke and hovering over us so it ruined the ambiance. Over all it was disappointing. I could've had the same meal at Applebee's for half the price."}
{"text":"Great place - I've gone there quite a few times over the past year and have only had good experiences.  Never have to wait for a waitress and I always have a cold beer in my hand.  Definitely the best Tilted Kilt in the Greater Phoenix area."}
{"text":"so been drug here a few times since and had a much better time   some of the staff were actually friendly and helpful!  food was decent"}
{"text":"Good beer and apps. I love the Linq. It's it's own little world on the Las Vegas Strip. Fun place for kids of all ages."}
{"text":"We stop in here usually before or after a game. We usually have great service. The girls are always friendly and helpful. I am a fan of their garlic parmesan wings. My fiancé wished that they had Budweiser on tap and not just bottles. We would eat here a lot more if they had Budweiser on tap, just saying :)"}
{"text":"Great food!!! this place is a upgraded hooter's. The bar area is nice full of tv's for your sport events. Besides you can't go wrong with guinness and wings."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful time. Our server Brittany was upbeat and happy. She suggested drunken clams which were absolutely amazing. The atmosphere was awesome. I had never been to that place we will definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Will not go back there again!! The pulled pork street tacos were very bland and the margarita was way over priced! I traded out Patron for another tequila and they charged me $8 extra for the substitution! It tasted like store bought margarita mix with very little tequila!! A $9 margarita cost $16.95 for a small Cosmo sized glass!! That's ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"I was invited here for lunch with coworkers today.  Having never been here before, I had no basis of expectation to go on.    My first impression was \"Wow, the uniforms make Hooters uniforms look like snow suits.\"  Not really the kind of quality I look for in a restaurant.  The staff were friendly,and the food came surprisingly quick considering that there were about 15 of us.  I had the barbecue bacon burger.  The burger itself wasn't bad, but would have been quite dry if it weren't for the BBQ sauce.  The fries were amongst the worst I've had in a long time.  They were soggy and undercooked.    The Tilted Kilt is the kind of place I will leave for college kids drunk on beer and testosterone.  Not my kinda restaurant."}
{"text":"Our Kilt Girl was Nevada, who is a ginger-haired goddess! She was very attentive and helpful. Nevada spent time chatting with my husband and me and we truly felt welcomed and important. The food was fantastic, as were the drink specials. Today was Ladies' Night, so I enjoyed two Cosmos and some great appetizers. Nevada helped us purchase 2 Dog Tags that benefit Folds of Honor as well! Tilted Kilt definitely needs Nevada in the calendar. She is a cheerleader and very adorable. Nevada helped make my birthday celebration the best!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I am spoiled because I live next to the Anaheim, CA location ( Next to Angels Stadium ) But I was very disappointed in this Scottsdale location. I swore to my buddies it would be good, because that's all I have ever known. I was wrong.   1 - It was the third day of NCAA March Madness, and they had wrestling on all the TVs with its main audio in the speakers. And, University or Arizona was playing!!!! I was shocked. And it took a very long time to get it changed.  2. Google said it would be busy, but half of the tables were open. And despite the open seating, it took me 20 minutes to get my second beer while my food was already here. There was no water brought, so I was eating hot wings with no way to cool down.   3. Overall service from anyone other than our server was awful. We felt like a hassle.  I can't wait to go home."}
{"text":"We had a birthday party for a couple friends, and Lauren took great care of us. She took pictures of the group and also took a pic with the bday guys. Food was great, beer was cold - we had a fantastic time!"}
{"text":"the food was pretty good, I had a burger, my dad has the fish tacos. We enjoyed watching the game and the atmosphere was nice, sports bar feel"}
{"text":"Very nice new location. Went to old Location 3 years ago. But the new location is better as it has more space. Went out with some good friends and we had Fried Pickles, Pub Pretzels, and Scotch Eggs for appetizers which all were delicious.   For the main entree, friends had baby back ribs, bone in wings with the tilted sauce. The ribs were great, bbq sauce tasted well and fell off bone. The wings were great according to my friend.  The service was very good, only thing I need to mention is the waitress serving us delayed getting my iced tea and on refills. As far as the negative reviews of this place, don't really understand them, but our experience was very good and enjoyable. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Although we were planning on going to the Pirates game, which we found out was sold out when we arrived. . .Bill and I decided our night would then consist of dinner and gambling so we picked the Tilted Kilt!  First of all, just being blunt. . .if your a girl and your taking your man here and your the insecure type. . .pick somewhere else.  The girls here are scantily clad and attractive.  However, they were all super nice and helpful.  Im pretty unfazed by that type of atmosphere so it was easy for me to be relaxed and just enjoy the time with my man.  Its a cool place because like Mel said there are TV's everywhere and although we couldn't get into the game we were able to watch baseball right above us and keep current on the score.  Onto the food, in my opinion. . .it was above average.  I had the fried chicken salad which was huge.  The lettuce was crisp romaine (my favorite!) and the honey mustard dressing was perfect.  The only downside to my meal was that they put mandarin oranges in my salad...just not my thing but oh well! Bill ordered the Irish Stew and he loved it!  I would return to the Tilted Kilt again definitely. . .it is a little on the pricier side but, I think it will do well in Pittsburgh especially on the North Side!"}
{"text":"I first went to the Tilted Kilt about 6 months ago. Since that time it has become my favorite restaurant. I enjoy the atmosphere, the wonderful food and I have tried several different dishes.   One of my favorite servers is Lixuan.  She is very attentive to all her customers. Her wonderful smile has brightened my day many times. She has been tremendously helpful by suggesting different food and beers so every visit it's like a new experience."}
{"text":"Hooters.   It's Hooters.  Different decor, different uniforms, different menu; but it's Hooters. And what, boys and girls, is Hooters?   A place to go get ripped off your ass on a corporate card; certainly not worth your own money.   The staff was just friendly enough.  They didn't exude enthusiasm in any way.  Like Hooters, the business model is based on having a wait staff that is visually stunning.  Yeah....  not so much here... and before you go ripping in to me about being a pig or \"look in the mirror, Porky,\" understand I don't care what servers look like; unless it's a place where they're a brass pole away from being entertainers... like this one.   My food wasn't bad.   It wasn't anything special.   I looked through the menu and regretted my choice in lunch venue.   Sigh.  The same Applebee's-Chili's-TGIFriday bullshit you see everywhere else; just with different Scots-inspired names.  I ordered a cheeseburger and it came with fries.   The food came quickly enough and it looked fine.  My server had neglected to get me utensils or a napkin, so I had to ask for that.  Now, I am of the opinion that every burger in an American sit-down-joint should automatically come with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, ketchup, mustard and mayo.  Not that YOU have to eat it that way, not that I even eat it that way, but those are the standard condiments for burgers.... period.  My burger came with a dill pickle spear, lettuce and tomato (one transparent slice).  I asked my server for some mayo for my burger.  I GOT CHARGED A DOLLAR FOR FREAKING MAYONNAISE.    Eleven dollars and eighty nine cents for a cheeseburger (that came with fries) and a water...  before tip.   Ah, so that's how it's going to be, eh, Kilt?   No problem-o.   Here's your two-star Yelp rating.   I won't be back, unless, as said above, some honcho is laying down the AmEx Business card and we're going to do Jameson's 18-year all night long on the company dime."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to stop on the North Shore. They have a nice sized bar, large seating indoors, and seating outdoors. Their outdoor seating also includes a nice view of the rivers, that is sometimes obstructed by some of the growth along the river.  They have live music. They had a DJ when we visited on a Saturday night.  This was an excellent place to stop for some drinks after a ball game at PNC. Unfortunately, I didn't dine here, so can not speak to the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I had a large group of people (around 30) that wanted to meet up at Tilted Kilt after the WWE's Royal Rumble PPV. I called about a week advance and they said, even though they don't usually take reservations, they would set us up with the party room for the time we requested.  Everything ended up going about as well as possible. The waitresses did an excellent job and they were very organized. Everyone got their checks separated and in an orderly fashion. One person's order got messed up and they were able to get something else and weren't charged for the meal. Everyone else enjoyed their food and the staff was very good about getting an extra table and chairs in there when we needed them.  I just wanted to say that I had a tremendous time and I was extremely satisfied. Thank you Tilted Kilt for accommodating us!"}
{"text":"Service was fine, food was OK, but I'll never come here again. Whether you are inside or on the outside bar area you will smell like smoke. Nobody stops people from smoking in the \"outside\" bar are which just carries on over into the inside area.  Thank you Tilted Kilt for my eyes hurting and for me having to take a shower as soon. As I get home."}
{"text":"Crappy bar food. Greasy.  Didn't know we were going to a strip club, though the service was friendly.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Short walk from our hotel. Was busy after a Pirates game, but once the game was over, it took them quite a while to turn on the FREE UFC fights. Instead, had on Cops. REALLY?  They had the completely wrong city for a beer that is brewed in my hometown of San Diego. It can't be that hard to find that information out!  Despite the above, our food and service was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Are zero stars an option? This place is awful. We walked in and place was basically empty. Of course, the bar tender is beautiful, that is whole point of place. However, bar was filthy, crumbs, wet drink spots all over and, again, no one at bar.  She literally sat there looking at us while sitting at bar and never even cleaned it up, moved, nothing. Then we order, she pours beer that is pure foam. Then wipes off side of glass and mouth with hand. Still never cleans bar. Literally sets beer down on bar in crumbs. Still never cleans bar.   In addition, she has the personality of a brick wall. Clearly not the reason anyone comes to a Tilted Kilt. The (manager) seemed oblivious and didn't care less either about condition of bar, etc.   I would never set foot in here again. No wonder these places are closing all over the country. Clear that no one working there cares about customers or wants to be there."}
{"text":"Strictly a T & A place. Poor food (4.5 potato skins for $8, why the half I do not know, and the size of red pototatos), large screen TVs with tables too close to watch (this is not a sports bar) with music playing overhead during games. Service is air-heady but very cute."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and got very sick both times. If you are just going to drink then it's fine. They actually have a pretty great draft selection and the bartenders are nice, just don't eat the food."}
{"text":"We are locals, came to celebrate our sons birthday who flew in from LA just to try the Vegas Tilted Kilt. The one in LA is far superior to this one. First off the service was horrible, NO refills on drinks. The girls look past you almost like they are better than you and the food was cold. There were 4 of us at the table and we all agreed....Tilted Kilt at the Linq.... NO MAS!"}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks. Our bartender was Gailey--she was helpful and friendly!! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I really expected a better selection of beers from a \"pub.\" My friend brought me here on a Friday night and it was fairly civil inside. Easy to get drinks, easy to find a seat and get food. I really wasn't blown away by anything and would probably only come back inside via a pub crawl. It's definitely not a place you go out of your way to visit. It also strangely felt like Hooters for an older, rowdier crowd. Way too many other bars to visit if you're from out of town and looking king for that vegas feel."}
{"text":"I have not eaten anything at the Tilted Kilt but I want to write a review thanking the staff of the Tilted Kilt.  It was my boyfriend's birthday on St. Patrick's Day and I had paid online for tickets to get in to the street party.  By the time we got there that evening they were letting people in for free so the money I could have spent on food and drinks went to tickets I didn't need.  A manager, I think his name was Joe, was very accommodating and escorted our party to the VIP section.  The drinks at the bar were twice the size of any drink I've gotten at any party I've been at before and the bartenders were fun and lively even though it was cold and windy outside.  I really appreciated the effort that was made by all the staff to make sure everyone enjoyed themselves at the street party even though it was so cold and so many people were leaving because of the cold."}
{"text":"one of the better sports bars to watch football at. Their food is pretty good, great amount of TV's too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food was good (4/5 stars), service was good (4/5) stars, even though I had to ask 4 times for the staff to put on a Stanley Cup game. Drink prices were great, too! I wish they would've had the sound on for the game, but I was happily surprised that they were playing country music! Tip for TK: put the sound on for the big game of the day so that it can be fully enjoyed! Otherwise, super clean and refreshing sports bar!"}
{"text":"Let's face it....the waitresses are smoking hot and wearing very sexy outfits!!  The food was okay, but they make up for it with an outstanding bar!!!"}
{"text":"Found myself here with a large group of college friends on a reunion, and I would gladly eat a bucket of hot monkey puke before stepping foot in the place again. I wish I could attest to how poor the beer and food are, but I wasn't given the opportunity to sample them. Instead I spent ten minutes trying to get the attention of the bartender who appeared to ingest anabolic steroids in the manner that others eat Tic-Tacs, serving no one and pointedly ignoring me while preening a ridiculous haircut that brought to mind a commercial for Pubis by Loreal. The women servers were gorgeous, by the way, but appeared to be every bit as incompetent and indifferent as the crotch-headed troglodyte behind the bar. Unless you have a pathological schoolgirl fetish, stay far, far away."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday (12/11/2016) for 11AM cardinals game. Got there and the place wasn't busy and the restaurant looked clean. Ask to sit by the Cardinals game. The game was on TV at the two ends of the bar. When I asked to have the game on in front of our table (no one was there) I was told sorry no we can't change the Tv on game day. I wasn't pleased. Especially since most ppl in the bar where cardinals fans. Not going back on game day :-("}
{"text":"Oh Tilted Kilt, what can I say about you? If I claim to like the food, will anyone believe me?   The interior is nice, though it gets crowded during big sports events.   In general the menu is good, though distinctly of the fried, bar food variety.    They have some good spicy options including a fairly decent jalapeno burger that is a big winner with me.   I'm also something of a fan of their bar service.  They have a pretty decent Irish Carbomb that they call a Belfast Boom.     I won't bother talking about the waitresses since you know what kind of place this is already but in general I've always gotten good service here.   Took a friend here for a bachelor party once and the results were pretty entertaining.   We usually have a good time whenever we go but expect plenty of skeevy businessmen who come to leer at the waitresses and 20-somethings (who also come to leer at the waitresses...)     Tilted Kilt is ace in my book for having significantly better food than Hooter's and it's my go-to place if I've got some bros to entertain.  They always seem to like it."}
{"text":"Food was okay. I had the monte criso i have had better. The service and long wait for food was unbelievable 45 minutes. Food was delivered waitress never checked on us. They were not that busy  appears to be understaffed. Sports atmosphere was good lots of TVs with all sports on. Too loud to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Good food great service nice people great beer the workers are very friendly I had the buffalo chicken pizza it was AWESOME!!! Next time I'm in town in going try the nachos"}
{"text":"Had a really great time. Very friendly staff and very helpful. Food was great. Had the Irish nachos and the Scottish cheesesteak. Yeah you can't really go wrong with those, but they were much better than I expected. Don't forget to ask or sriracha for your Irish nachos! Vanessa and Hugo were awesome"}
{"text":"The service and hospitality is amazing, the bar tenders Sara and Kim are fantastic. I will definitely go back soon. keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"They seemed to have a good thing going at the original store in Tempe but that didn't carry over to the new place near I-10. Super Bowl Sunday was a joke. We arrived an hour before the 3pm shift change and were warned that the manager was doing a computer reboot at 2:15 so if we wanted any food, we'd better order now. Huh? Server delivered half our drink order, but after 20 minutes, I asked the bartender if server had put in the order for the alcohol portion. \"No. Sorry.\" He comped our drink. Day-shift gave us our check at 2:45. Never saw her again. At 3:20, we asked a different server if there was anyone working our section. \"Probably.\" After another ten minutes, she asked if anyone had come by. No. The rest of our experience was on par with that. Food was passable. Luckily, our team won even though The Kilt lost."}
{"text":"Still seething after nine days!  Visited this place because it was a familiar site from San Diego. Was in Ohio for first time with my three sons, visited Footbal and Rock n Roll Halls of Fame.  We were made \"felt out of place\" by the greeting staff and waitress. T & A might get people in but good old fashion excellent customer service gets them returning.  Experience was so bad I won't even go back to my local Tilted Kilt in San Diego.  It is a privilege for an establishment to earn my business,  not the other way around..."}
{"text":"I took my family here for dinner back in July. As we walked to the front door, there were the girls standing there with the attitude of not wanting to be there. When we got seated, our waitress took out drink orders and walked away. There was no \"Hello my is ??? And welcome to Tilted Kilt.\" When she came back with our drinks, 2 of them were wrong. She then looked at us and walked away to correct the order.  A few minutes later, she came back with the corrected drinks, put them in the table and walked away. We all just said maybe she is just having a bad day.  Several minutes later, she came back and too our order. When she came back with our food, my sisters order was wrong. When my sister told her that is not what she ordered, our waitress rolled her eyes and walked away with the wrong order. When she came back with with the correct order, she did apologize but it was not very genuine.  When she came back with the tab, my niece called our waitress out on her attitude and again she rolled her eyes and said she was sorry. We called the manager over and explained the service we received  and he actually just laughed it off. Not very professional Mr. Manager. He said we would comp our drink for the inconvenience. We weren't looking for any freebies but just a genuine apology and correction. I have vowed to never go in this Tilted Kilt ever again. The one in Green Bay, WI is the best Tilted Kilt I have been to. Maybe the staff here could learn from their Green Bay franchise."}
{"text":"We came here one night to watch the UFC fights. Unfortunately there was also football on. So we paid to get in to watch the fights, but there was crowds of people cheering for football at the same time. SO it was a bit distracting. And overly crowded.  However, that is expected on a busy Saturday night so I can look past that and focus more on the service and food.  The service was good. The waitress was attentive and friendly.  The food we got was great!   The drinks are great as well. It is a fun environment!"}
{"text":"I must admit I did not like this place. The place is not clean by any standard! The waitresses, as with most waitressess at the joint are pretty faces who have a tendancy to mess up simple orders.   Its an ok place to go watch a game or some sporting event but apart from that its pretty lame."}
{"text":"This Tilted Kilt is in the perfect location on the Linq Promenade, so it's really central. I like that it has the garage door windows at the bar that make it feel like an open air bar. As we walked up the Linq High Roller had a quick song and light show playing, which was unexpected and fun. Our hostess was really funny and full of personality. We decided to sit at a table instead of the bar. There was a hockey game for the Vegas team playing so tons of people were here to watch and spirits were energetic.  Our waitress was pretty prompt and on it. We ordered wings as an appetizer with Mango Habenero and Buffalo sauces. The Buffalo was nice and spicy but Mango wasn't as spicy, still good flavor though. The chicken was nice and crispy. I'd definitely order the wings again. I ordered a club sandwich, which was cooked well and I liked it all but I wish it has just a hint more flavor of some kind. The fries were basic but good. My boyfriend got the wicked Boston burger and he said it was perfectly cooked except the bacon was not cooked as much as he would normally like. Overall we enjoyed are meal and the service was decent. It's a fun spot in a good location with decent food and decent prices on food. The only thing is I would say that was negative is the beer prices were pretty crazy. I believe the cheapest 16 oz was $9, but most were $10+. That was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Dined with them on NYE with my wife and another couple.  We ordered several food items and a few rounds of drinks.  The bill was over $200  I ordered a burger.  After 2 bites I could see it was completely raw.   Naturally I sent it back.  When we were presented with the check I saw I was charged for two burgers.   I figured they would have comped the burger, certainly not charge for two.  I brought it to the waitresses attention and she removed one of them.  At this point I was a bit annoyed as it appeared that they were hoping maybe I would just pay the bill and not notice.  I asked for the manager and explained what had happened.  Still no offer to do anything.   He said he would have to talk to the GM.   I assumed he pretended to talk to someone, as I can't imagine a manager doesn't have the authority to offer a $13 credit.   After 5 minutes he comes back and says the GM agreed to take 1/2 off the burger as they can't credit for consumed food.  Usually in a situation like this you want to do something to leave a customer with a good feeling to make up for the mistake.   Not here."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We called ahead to make sure they would be playing the OU game, was told yes. Got there, no game.   Asked about beers on tap, what was local, etc waitress didn't know, left for what felt like 10 minutes only to tell us she wasn't sure.  Food was plain, nothing special to rave about. Our waitress was sweet but everything else lacked. This was my first time at any Tilted Kilt and probably my last."}
{"text":"Cliche, similarly to the South Park episode where they goofed on Hooters, my server couldn't finish a sentence without invoking the term 'hon'.   [me sitting at bar]  Bartender:      \"Like a menu - hon?\"                           \"Are you expecting anyone - hon?\"                           \"How was the pastrami - hon?\"                           \"Men's room?   Down the hall to your right - hon.\"   Two hours later........                            \"Are you ok? Wow, that was a nasty spill - looked like it really hurt. Should I call you a cab?   Me: [thinking it, but unable to speak it]      WTF? No hon? Seriously?  I was her 'hon' for the last three hours, now nothing?  Seventy three dollars worth of Lagunitas and Crown Black, I'm numb from the northern-most  sweat-spiked hair follicle downward to my toenails, I'm slurring one-syllable words such as 'the'  and 'it' and the 'hons' mysteriously stop?  Totally uncool.   Warning guys: \"You can get pretty 'hon-d-up' in a place like this thanks to all the overly-friendly servers. The boobs are nice to look at. though."}
{"text":"Just ordered room service from this place...they deliver right to your room when staying at the Sleep Inn across the street.  I got the fish tacos and they were pretty good.  Delivery was fast and food was hot."}
{"text":"People don't go here for the dessert (or the food really), and rightly so. All three items in the \"Titled Guilt\" dessert weren't very good... 1) hot chocolate chip cookie, 2) vanilla ice cream, and 3) chocolate syrup.  Keep to the beer and people watching."}
{"text":"Came here with the wife, as we found most other restaurants along the LINQ Promenade was just a rip off. This place was probably the most reasonable prices by far.  On entry, all the waitstaff were dressed in little cute outfits and would definitely tempt in red blooded male to dine & maybe stay for a little longer than normal (also give a higher tip than normal).  Our waitress was as nice as pie but also cute as a button. She was very helpful & friendly.  The food was great too, however I would suggest that this place offer some sauces such as aioli to go with the fries as they were fairly boring.  Would definitely return and not just for the cute waitresses as my wife has suggested."}
{"text":"Over priced good bar food. I did like the free beer sign at the door.....but that was about it. Oh yeah, the drunk Canadians that were there were funny too"}
{"text":"After taking our drink order our waitress went MIA I had to get up and get our drinks myself . I ordered the fish and chips the fries were cold and the fish was burnt. The waitress was young and under trained. It looks like a great place to drink and watch sports just not a good place to eat.  I've tried this place before and was disappointed but I thought I'd give them another chance.  I won't go back"}
{"text":"Last september i was staying at \"The Linq\" we did the check-in and dropped our bags in the room 'cuz we were starving, we went downstairs in search of food (No mattern what), we stepped outside of the hotel and the first thing we saw was a group of beautiful ladies with just the necessary clothes on 'em, naturally we approached to meet them and for our surprise we found out that they were promoting their restaurant so inmediatilly ask them for a table (to eat...food).  The place was a sports bar with nice selection of burguers and that kind of food you normally eat while you have a beer in your hand and a football match infront of you.  Tilted kilt is kind of crowded, what makes the service a little slow, so if you don't like sports you should find a different place to go, food is not that bad and they got a good selection in beers (Bottle or draft), and the plus that waitresses are dressed whit short school skirts and tight blouses with huge necklines that shows more of this girls attitude, i'm definitely coming back, because of the beer and the sports obviously."}
{"text":"Been to many of the locations over the years, this is 1 of the neatest in downtown Cleveland, super huge and neat Bar area.  Great place to watch games.  Tons of selections on tap."}
{"text":"Good service. Husband had the bacon BBQ burger with sweet potato fries and he liked it. I had the Gaelic Chicken with fettuccine noodles. Huge regret! The noodles were oily to the point of being slimy, the chicken was bland but moist. I usually take home my left overs because I hate seeing food go to waste but I didn't waste my time knowing I'd never touch the food again.  The girls are pretty, nice to look at like hooters. Come for the view, stay for the view. Food not worth it.   MILITARY DISCOUNT AVAILABLE"}
{"text":"After a couple of visits to Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery, I think I've had my fill.  On my first visit with a group of friends, we were denied food because it was too close to the kitchen's closing time or something of that nature.  Frankly, given they were new to downtown Phoenix at the time and just beginning to build a clientele, so I was a bit surprised they turned away a party of about ten people.  No worries--we found another local place perfectly willing to accommodate us.  My more recent visit was just a couple of days ago; a party of two in the afternoon hours.  At first, the server seamed quick and attentive, but after serving drinks and entrees, disappeared.  We had to wait about 30 minutes after finishing our meals to get a carryout container, then she never brought the check.  So much for the service.  The food was mediocre.  I say that because my friend enjoyed the Pastrami Sandwich, my I didn't care for the Danny Boy's Shepherd's Pie at all.  The mashed potatoes had the texture of cardboard and the mystery meat had no flavor of beef.  I guess the two meals averaged out to \"mediocre.\"  Of course, the absentee server might have known that if she bothered to check back with us.  I don't ask for much --- I really don't.  I never send my food back, but is dropping $50 on two entrees and two drinks in exchange for discernible food and a server who doesn't forget you exists too much to ask for?  :::Sigh:::   Oh, and I like to be able to hear the game on tv as much as anyone else, but PLEASE turn it down a notch so I can hear the person sitting two feet away from me speak."}
{"text":"Used to frequent the Tilted Kilt over by the Paradise Valley mall but because they closed it down, this was the 2nd closest location.  1st issue: Came here for the Mayweather/McGregor fight...normally we've only been charged a $10 cover for PPV fights...this location charges $20...complete rip off given the fact that we spend about $200 on food and drinks while watching the fight.  2nd issue: The manager working the front door collecting all the cover charges was a complete prick. He wouldn't seat parties unless every single one of the people in someone's party was present. Even if you were missing just ONE person, he wasn't having any of it. I can understand if MOST of your part is missing, but ONE person?! Come on!! Then to top it off, he was telling people, \"You'll sit where I seat you and if need be, you won't be sitting with the people you came with, you'll need to share tables with random people...if you don't like it, go somewhere else. We're already full as it is so you'll be lucky I even decide to seat you at all.\" Completely uncalled for!!!!! 3rd issue: All drinks were coming in 16 oz. plastic cups...you ordered a large beer? Too bad, you got 16 ounces of beer and were still charged the full beer price. They're completely scamming the customer and lining their own pockets!!! Lesson learned, don't come to Tilted Kilt for ANY PPV fights!!! To be honest, between the manager and the fact they're STEALING money by not giving you the amount of alcohol you're paying for, I won't be returning.  Edit: They just sat some new people at my table who said they paid WAY more to get in here than we did...apparently this place is charging more money when there is STANDING ROOM only in here. What a complete scam!!!!"}
{"text":"We figured this would be a good spot after a spring training game since its across the street. Hostess was cordial and seated us towards end of restaurant. Place was fairly empty. Our waitress took our drink and appetizer order. After we received them and finished that, our waitress never came to our table. We seen her towards the hostess area chatting it up with other waitresses and playing with her hair for over 15 minutes. Our cups were dry and appetizers gone. We tried to wave her over and no response. After some more time she came over, we just asked for tab and left.   I have been here before during non baseball season and it was ok, nothing great. i did see another waitress hustling, but ours was horrible."}
{"text":"Willie is the best bar back!!! Lee and Sandra have a welcoming personality and are the best bartenders this side of the Mississippi!! Everytime I come in to this location I feel at home!!!"}
{"text":"Not quite what it used to be. Its not bad by any means, its just not great. Food is decent and the beer is ice cold. Not a place that i crave but i'll definitely be back sometime."}
{"text":"Will not return!,,   The service is a joke around 15 min. To get our drinks food was so so. Watch when they bring your bill had to be sent back three times until they had the right total on it. Saved several dollars doing this have a feeling this happens often, just saying"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to watch the UFC fights and they happened to be one of the few places that were showing it. The place was easy enough to find which is important and the parking was convenient. When we walked in there was (of course) a small cover charge and we were paper wrist banded. It was pretty crowded as many people were looking forward to this fight night. We found a few spots up at the bar and squeezed our way in. We were immediately handed menus and offered beverages which we took advantage of. Throughout the evening, we enjoyed ourselves as the service was surprisingly attentive for the amount of business they were doing. The wings were delicious, but cannot say the same for our attempt to be healthy. The side of steamed veggies were just basically over cooked frozen vegetables. Oh well, it is a sports bar... All in all, it was a good night and not too expensive. We will be back."}
{"text":"All around not a good experience for my 1st time dining...tilted tea was awful full of sour mix!!!"}
{"text":"I work at tilted kilt so I had to stop in! The place was packed but luckily we got 2 seats at the bar. We just came in for a couple drinks. My mule was really good :) They service was quick and the place was nice & clean!"}
{"text":"Compared to the one in Orange, Cali., this one has much better service, food taste better! Will definitely be back to watch my ducks! The Kilt Club was very good!"}
{"text":"Wow. The number of items on the menu went way down and the prices went way up.The chicken sandwich was about 50% more than usual.  I feel taken advantage of."}
{"text":"Though I've had a few times here that were a little disappointing, the Kilt has revamped their menu and I was pretty happy with it.   We went as a group of 6 with 4 different checks, and our server totally kept her cool about it. She was quick on getting on orders and keeping drinks flowing, but I felt like she sort of disappeared once we had our food.  Food was good - I had the Irish Dip and my husband ordered Pulled Pork Mac and Cheese. Friend ordered Stuffed Breasts, 2 others had apps, and 1 didn't order food. We were all pleased with our food choices, no complaints from the table on the taste. My only issue was that my side salad came out with my entree. I would have preferred to have it separately before my sandwich.  Drinks were maybe a bit weak -  I ordered a vodka and lemonade, and in many places I have to ask for an additional bit of lemonade because my drinks are too strong. This one tasted like lemonade. Fine for me, but others would have preferred it a bit stronger.   Oddly, we had to search a bit to find our server when we were ready for our checks, and the place was actually less busy by that time, but maybe she got sidetracked somewhere. Also, I'd really like to see this place remodel the bathrooms. :) I'd give 3.5 stars if I could, but since that's not possible, I'm rounding to 4."}
{"text":"Like many other reviews, we were disappointed in the wait for service.   People walking up to the outdoor serving windows were getting served before those of us inside the bar waiting our turn.  When we did get service, the Long Island Iced Teas were very good and at the best price we found all day.   The wife only had one statement regarding the female bartenders and their outfits.......\"holy boobs\"........but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.   Only complaint beside service was music was WAY TOO LOUD to have a conversation."}
{"text":"The wraps are super yummy. Great service our server was very nice and came to check on us constantly. Great selection of beer and they have over 6 tvs for the games."}
{"text":"Always what you expect in a good \"Breastaurant\".  Good food, nice servers and the game on."}
{"text":"Just left. Had to ask for menu. I ordered a club and my friend ordered a steak aju sandwich. After I finished mine, his was still not there. I politely asked the server behind the bar to just cancel my friends and give us our check. She didn't like this..didn't say sorry, thanks you or kiss my ass. Just acted like I had done something wrong. The \"managers\" were 3 feet away... I saw her tell them both what had just happened. They did not attempt to do anything. This place is a joke. If you see it just pass it by. Better luck somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's OK.  I like the location.   The food is typical.  Nothing innovative.  The skimpy outfits on the waitresses are great if you are a bunch of dudes with no women to talk to."}
{"text":"A buddy of mine and I went last Friday for a beer and a sandwich. Although the service was not the best I wouldn't call it horrible. But what was really upsetting was seeing my bank account this morning showing a debit higher than the actual  total. I reviewed my receipt again to make sure I didn't add incorrectly, and I hadn't.   The total was $15.40 and I left a $2.60 tip, for an even total of $18. The amount charged to my account was $19.25. I won't cry over $1.25, but I thought to share this to caution others who also pay with debit cards and spend a lot more $$$ at this Tilted Kilt.  Double check your receipts vs your bank account."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty good overall. I've been to the bar twice the last two nights visiting from California. Food and service are really good. Prices are decent too. But tonight I witnessed the manager come to a guy at the bar telling him he can't smoke his e cig at the bar, but literally they have a patio that's basically inside the restaurant with a small window that's open where people smoke cigarettes. All the smoke comes inside the restaurant the whole time and it smells like smoke, but someone smokes an e cig and it doesn't even smell and evaporates in seconds and they have to stop? Seems ass backwards to me. I was gonna write this review as a 4 or 5 star but downgraded to a 3 now."}
{"text":"Just went for drinks with the girls.  The bartenders are nice and friendly.  Great service.  Lots of televisions.  Watched the Rousey fight there.  Great music videos when the fights were over.  Fun place to just hang out.  Definitely recommend it.  I hear the food is good as well but I didn't try it."}
{"text":"I spent an evening with Employees Drew and Ashley! I had the BEST time! They were kind and curtious! The food was great too! Had a great time!"}
{"text":"The pictures of hot chicks posted by the owner on the yelp page enticed me to come here, and it was me, ME, who begged my guy friends to join me.   The place was pretty empty and everyone looked less than happy to serve us- okay so we had 2 girls in our group, are we less deserving of the laughter and small conversation that we saw given to the other tables? I asked my friends if I was just imagining it but nope, they agreed that our server looked like they'd rather be anywhere else but at our table.   Our group ordered a large amount of food and a few drinks and everything came out in a timely manner but barely anything tasted.. good. I only had the fries but they were ok to me! My friends had the tacos, which they claimed to lack any flavour at all. My other friend ordered the Shepard's pie and he said it was just gross and didn't taste the way a shep's pie should and apparently saltier than your ex.   During our meal, I saw the girls (ps why are you guys so overstaffed? There were literally 6 girls at the front just chatting at any given time during our meal and a bunch more serving. Oh well, better overstaffed than under).. Anyway, I saw the waitresses giggling and wiggling their way inside booths full of guys several times. So unprofessional to do that during work- I get its a bar and trust me, I've been to many, and the girls at my favourite bars have declined sitting down so many times because it doesn't look good to other customers, so in my head, I've been conditioned to know that is definitely not appropriate.   Overall, food- I'll pass. Service was nothing spectacular- jeez, it looked like it was killing her to smile. Going there for hot chicks as displayed in the pics - I don't want to be rude so I'll just say 'high expectations means I was disappointed' & the pics on here are extremely deceptive."}
{"text":"Had a great burger here!  Service was good, typical pub environment.  Good for large groups and families.  The overall menu is pretty good, food quality was excellent.  If you're in the mood for pub food, TV's, girls in short skirts and low cut tops (think Scottish Hooters theme), then this place is for you."}
{"text":"The food here is really disappointing if you are looking for some good bar food/happy hour munchies. The Queso Dip is some kind of cheese with ground up sausage and sits in a pool of grease. The Fish tacos have no flavor and the wings are just meh. Waste of money if you ask me."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in downtown Phoenix, Tilted  Kilt Pub & Eatery is a great option if you are just looking to enjoy some quick bites and great drinks. My hotel was actually only two doors down from this location so can you say super score?!   Upon arrival my co-workers and I walked in to what we thought was going to be a long wait time but To our surprise  it wasn't so we were thankfully seated immediately. The luck didn't stop there though JR turns out that we showed up right at the start of happy hour so that automatically gives a few more brownie points!   The weather was great so of course we took advantage of being seated outside on the rooftop! Not sure if there was a game or something going on but it was pretty busy down by the arena so people watching was defiantly fun!  Once our waitress arrived to take our drink orders I couldn't wait to put in my request to use the yelp check in offer for free fried pickles! Along with that we took a round of margaritas, and added some chili con queso to our appetizers! The fish tacos happened to be on the happy hour menu so I went with those as my actual entree lol. For $7 it was very well worth it! Usually fish tacos aren't very filling but my plate came out with 3 nice size tacos that did more than fill me up!   Overall the experience was pretty good! Minus the situation with one of my co-workers burgers coming out not done enough, Service was great!"}
{"text":"The extra star is only because I enjoyed my meal.    The majority of servers have huge attitude and ignored us when we wanted to order more drinks.  They walk behind the bar looking at the ceiling??  LOL  A fun night, but, there are many better choices on The Esplanade.  I will not be a repeat customer.  Yup -- it's like that Tilted Kilt!"}
{"text":"Great place to catch sporting events. They have multiple TV's throughout the restaurant and is quite the hotpot on game days. For the appetizer, we ordered the potatoes skins nachos and it was quite good. It definitely tastes better than the regular nacho chips. Tilted Kilt has some drink specials on any given day of the week. Staff were quite friendly and helpful. The service was good even during the busy times that I went. For the entre, I didn't their like their Mac and Cheese. It wasn't very good and under seasoned. Overall, it is still a great place to watch sporting events or have a decent pub food."}
{"text":"I live close by and come frequently. But the bartenders you have here on a Saturday (after 5)evening are the rudest. I feel bad even ordering another drink. Not ok. And a good way to push away neighborhood people that would come frequently if they got good service. I see this place going out soon from the way these bartenders behave.   I would never recommend this place to anyone and I live in a place that has many winter visitors. Nope to TK"}
{"text":"My first visit. Came in to join in on the HH. During this visit it was light possibly due to Christmas Eve. I wouldn't mind returning. Hooter uniforms don't have anything on these uniforms on the Tilted Kilt girls. I was like WWwhhhhaaaaOOOOooo.  (Compliment.)"}
{"text":"Sunday \"football\" Funday??? My wife and I went in to have a good time watching the Packer game and have food.  We asked if they would turn on audio to any if the games... The server says,  Corporate tells managers NOT to turn on audio for games and instead to play oldies rock music.  So we left and went to Zipps. It was busy and had a good sports bar enviornment..."}
{"text":"Poor service, girls decent at best... disappointing to say the least! Friend ordered food, completely wrong and bartender seems upset when it was sent back. We also have been waiting for over 10 minutes for a drink."}
{"text":"This place had more clap than an auditorium. Thank Jehovah that they finally shut this overpriced sorry excuse for a sports bar down. No idea where they find these skanky waitresses. Worse than the Tuesday afternoon C-team at a 3rd rate strip club under an overpass. If I saw one more infected naval piercing I was gonna puke. Service sucked, food overpriced, beer keg tap lines dirty. Good riddance. Note to all waitresses: beer first, chitchat second."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The hostesses and servers act like they don't want you to be here. Very rude staff and  it takes a very long time to order as they don't pay attention to the tables. We spoke to a manger about the service we received and as we left she had a smirk on her face and laughed as we walked out. Really recommend not dining here."}
{"text":"GREAT Place to get a beer or two and dinner before you go to a Suns, Dbacks or Mercury game. Best Burgers in town!! Great views of DT PHX from the outdoor bar/seating. 8/10 times the service is good but 2/10 times it is not so good.  All and All a  Great Place to grab dinner and drinks.   Plus lots of TVs to watch all the sports action!"}
{"text":"I have been to a couple of Tilted Kilts before and I like the sports bar theme with a ton of cool TV's. The food is usually just average. This time I went to this new location. Its huge with great TV's and a large misted patio. There were seven of us this night and the wait for a table was 40 minuets. Within 10 min we noticed a long narrow table open by the pools tables and sat there instead...this is where things go gown hill. Our server was Raven, wow was she bad.  We were all drinking and getting apps, so she could have made a lot on our table. We would wait 20 min for a drink, and had to go up the the bar a couple of times. We were constantly letting her know that we were thirsty to no avail. At one point she caught up and we had three drinks in front of us at the same time. She then complains that she will get in trouble because of all the drinks on the table when it was her timing that was off. The apps were good, but there was already a sour taste in our mouths from Raven's complete incompetence. I would probably go back, but not in her section."}
{"text":"I do realise this is the second day open at the new location, however, I ordered a black and Bleu burger it took over 40 minutes.  I accepted this as new crew blues.  But sitting at the bar ordering a beer on tap took well over 10 minutes.  The staff kept repeating it's our second day. I reminded them it's your second day at this location not your second day ever.  Most of the staff moved from down the street.   Here's the biggest irony of the whole night, I sat next to the owner at the bar.   He obviously doesn't care about service as he seemingly shrugged it off."}
{"text":"I love tilted kilts, I will travel hours to visit one. I have been to them in about half a dozen states. Unfortunately this was the most unenthusiastic tilted kilt I've been to. Drink and food was fine, but just fine and the waitresses and manager were more about being on their cellphone than customer service.   Overall it was adequate, but just adequate."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm back after a long hiatus of basically forgetting to log into yelp.  My bad!  Anyway, I think being a 30 year old woman disqualifies from writing a review about the Tilted Kilt but I will try anyway.  We recently bought a house VERY close to this establishment so like it or not I feel l will be frequenting it.  That said, I don't hate it nearly as much as I thought I would.  It's basically like a Hooters, the girls are slightly better dressed and not as dumb.  I never feel weird going here and the food is decent as is the beer selection.  There's lots of tv's for watching sports and generally has a good vibe.  There's a pool table and your fair share of old guys staring at the waitresses but I think that's to be expected in a place like this."}
{"text":"Meh. Went here after a Suns game recently... Decent beer selection. Food was underwhelming all-around.  Even the onion rings were funky.  I will likely not be stopping in here for food in the future when there are such good options nearby.  Stop in for beers, maybe!"}
{"text":"seated right away, so that wasnt an issue.  We sat outside and wanted to watch the football game, since it was sunday but the tv was off.  our waitress said she could get the manager to turn it on and so he came, said not a word to us, barely looked at us, turned it on, we thanked him-still not a word to us and just walked away.  wow, very rude.  so we told the waitress when she came back, and she said he had just turned it off, i guess the guests before us had requested the tv off, but hey, thats not our problem.  Its there for our enjoyment.  I ordered a philly cheesesteak which wasnt all that great,  i think they forgot the seasoning, and we got these garlic fries that were ok tho.  My friend, he had wings, and those too were just ok.  I wouldnt go back unless it was free.  We came in from out of state, MN and i definitely would have rather spent our money elsewhere, even at the jack in the box down the street.  The manager was just plan rude. dont know his name, cant even tell you what he looked like because he never even looked at us and he was 2 feet away.  I  think he was balding, and thats all i know."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. The girls are super pretty and really nice. This is a great spot. 10/10 coming back. Julianne was our waitress and she provided us with the best service and made sure we had everything we needed. We didn't wait long for anything. I'm really surprised at the negative reviews but when I look at the names it all seems like jealous girls. Everyone here is so beautiful and nice, I'm saying it again because it's true. Don't be a hater ladies!"}
{"text":"I have to say that the place is new, pretty nice inside, the bartender was good. And started to get busy while we were there.... All we ordered food wise was the pretzels which came out slow, but hit and they tasted great. We had 3 beers and a Bloody Mary between the two of us and our bill was as $51. I know this is Vegas and things may cost a little more. However, $11 for Angry Orchard is ridiculous. I know how much they pay for their legs and they are purposely gouging you on the cost of their draft beer. $51 for 2 pretzels and some beers. Lame. I wouldn't suggest or come back based on how expensive it is. I should add I have visited a Tilted Kilt in Arizona and it was not nearly as expensive. Vegas prices will keep me from ever coming back."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of what the waitresses wear. I thought the food was brought out extremely quickly, even for a busy night! If you are looking for a Hooters-ish restaurant, this is your spot. The chicken wings are actually quite tasty, and their burgers are good as well!"}
{"text":"Oh Geez, in a bad way, where to begin?  This place is basically a Hooter's themed bar but with none of the respect of quality of a Hooters. A lot of places are beginning to open up in the North Shore and I bet that it will really hurt their business.   We wanted to go to Rivertowne but the wait was very very long, so we walked next door to the Tilted Kilt. Not so shockingly, we got right in. The beer was beer. I mean it was reasonably priced for Pittsburgh, basic selection. I had a Sam's Octoberfest.   The food was terrible. I got the fish and chips and my boyfriend got the chicken tenders. I mean you can't mess that up right? My fish was so heavily breaded my first couple bites were just breading (and Heinz Ketchup, am I right?!) The grease from my fish, leaked through the paper and onto the table. The chicken tenders were basic and not burnt. They had been sitting under a heat lamp, you could tell they weren't too fresh. (They may have been \"re-fried\" like cooked once and then popped back in the fryer for a few seconds to heat them back up, but I'm not sure)   The waitress was nice, but not great.  The bathrooms? Gross! I stuck to the floor.   I would rather walk to the nearest 7-11 and get a Kind bar before eating here again."}
{"text":"Good place - waitress are hot in summer and ugly in winter - maybe the hot ones go back to uni. But whatever it's a decent place"}
{"text":"Stopped in this location during a recent trip to Scottsdale. Used my free birthday burger coupon, and sat outside at the bar area. Had great service from Dani, and I must say my burger was pretty damn good. It was cooked exactly how I ordered it, and I had it on grilled sourdough which added a nice crispiness and taste to the overall burger. It was a pretty good sized burger as well, with plenty of fresh veggies, and really hot and crispy seasoned fries. I really like the look and feel of this location as compared to others I have visited, and service was much better here as well. Definitely worth a stop in."}
{"text":"This place is what it is, another version of Hooters. It's nowhere near as fun as the original TK which was located in the Rio Hotel years ago. That being said, the service was fine, and the lovely BT was very friendly. My beers were actually reasonably priced, but that's because I partook in the canned beer surprise special. The atmosphere was OK, and of course the ladies were all beautiful. So if you're in the area it's definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Visited Tilted Kilt on a Friday night, around 9pm.  I expected it to be a lot like Twin Peaks.  The decor and girls in uniform were what i expected.  What I did not expect, however, was the loud blaring music coming from the DJ booth.  I'm not sure if all Tilted Kilts have a DJ on the weekends or it was because it was a Friday in Las Vegas at the Linq, but I was not a fan.  Turn down the music and I'll turn up my rating.  In order to talk to someone, you were basically shouting at each other.  Another annoyance was the fact that the restroom was located upstairs!!  How inconvenient is that??!!    Looking over the menu, all of the food was very reasonably priced, especially considering their location.  I ordered an Irish Dip which was their version of a prime rib dip for a mere $11 which came with a choice of chips, fries, or onion rings.  The onion rings were huge and plentiful.  The Irish dip, however, was on the smaller side.  Portion size aside, the thin slices of prime rib were delicious and their au jus was quite flavorful.  If you are a big eater or even just on the hungry side, I'd definitely suggest ordering an appetizer or a dessert.  Overall, the menu at Tilted Kilt looked pretty good.  There are a lot more dining options here than there are at Twin Peaks.    I didn't really go over the drink menu very carefully, just asked if they had any house brews.  Our waitresses informed us that they didn't have their own microbrew, but Killian's Irish Red was their house beer.  I'm a fan of Killian's so i had a pint.    I'd definitely go back and give this place another shot.  But if the music is blasting as it was on Friday, I'm skipping this place and going to Yard House."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend on a Friday night after 10 PM.  It looked dead.  We were looking for some fun and excitement but the place sucked and our waitress looked tired and bored.  My girlfriend looks way hotter than any of the girls here so there was nothing really much to look at.  We cancelled our drink order and left."}
{"text":"Before even coming on here to review the Tilted Kilt, I knew it was going to have a lower review. Not because the food or service sucked, because it was actually good. Any place that has scantily clad women in it, serving beer and food, will have a bad review. If you go in there expecting fine dining, then you will be sadly disappointed.   I'd put the food on par with Applebee's, maybe a little better. Even my wife, who even shutters at the mention of Hooters, enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere. We actually went here after competing at a Scottish games down the road, so we got a warm reception when we rolled up in our kilts. Prices were a little high, but honestly nothing more than what you would pay in Charleston for similar food.   It's fun and gimmicky, take it for that and nothing more."}
{"text":"They have a awesome management there I had a little issue and brandy the gm was awesome you can see how they are still busy even with street construction. Will eat there a lot."}
{"text":"Just as you can imagine, women dressed in kilts with their boobs popping out of their turtleneck sweaters. Once you get past this it's another Irish pub serving up some bar food.  We left the D-backs game in the 7th inning before the rush and started off with some pretty attentive service. As soon as the game was over, the place started to fill up and the two waitresses working became overwhelmed and getting drunk refills were tough to come by.  Not too shabby on the bar food. A pound of wings and fries were a pretty good pick. I liked the Asian glaze flavor more than the garlic Parmesan, surprisingly. A friend in the group had chicken tenders that I thought were good. We did check in on Yelp and while the check in offer is only good during lunch, they still honored a complimentary appetizer of fried pickles... and they were pretty darn good.  Definitely a good spot to catch some sports. Decent food. A little iffy on service. But can you imagine this place on St. Patrick's Day? Nuts!?!?"}
{"text":"How else would you start a mini vacation in the Phoenix area.  Well of course stop off at The Tilted Kilt for a quick drink and a few ok appetizers. Potatoe skins and wings, beer and booze.   Service was great.  It was not too busy but it was kinda late.  Would I go back well only if I have to."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  The food and drinks are excellent and the waitresses are just so nice."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give this pace ZERO stars, that's what I'd do. AWFUL. OK, it looks like a nice place from the outside. I noticed it from a couple visits to Rivertowne Northshore (separate review) and when the Groupon offer came, I snagged it. I am not a Hooters fan at all and don't like the food there. This place makes Hooters look like a gourmet restaurant. Food is terrible. Service is even worse. Took 20 minutes to get a beer and THERE WAS LESS THAN 10 people in the place. No one cleaned the obvious mess on the counter in front of me - even after I asked. We had to move to even get someplace that didn't look like some moron drooled all over it. Disgusting.  And don't tell me you'd be willing to go there to check out the ladies that work there. If that's the best Pittsburgh has to offer, we need to just call it quits now. Ditzy, nasty, inattentive, and not good looking? And bad food? OK, they have tons of TV and they do have beer. In my book, that's not enough.  The Groupon made it a half-price visit. I wouldn't set foot in there again if it were free."}
{"text":"1st visit to Tilted Kilt  I went there because me and my buddies wanted to have a guy's night out with out our girls around  We walked in and were greeted instantly by a beautiful lady by the name of Bri. We sat down she tended to us quickly the menu has a variety of foods and drinks on it I chose Saddies Stuffed Breasts and it was amazing we had mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and it was amazing my friends had gotten a Shepard's pie and the other an egg burger. How ever our waitress Bri. Was very friendly and helpful for when it came to figuring out what to eat. If your looking for a fun place to get great food and great service that not only looks great but is just as good as there looks I definitely recommend the Tilted Kilt on 87th in Peoria. And a shout out to Bri. For the memorial time."}
{"text":"Drinks here are pricey, and the food is average.    They were able to accommodate our big group, even though they were busy.  Our server was good, and all the guys in my group were in love with the cute server girls in their cute outfits.   Food here is your basic sports bar type of fare, ya know, nachos, chicken fingers, burgers etc...  And it tastes rather basic as well.  Drinks are inconsisent.  Sometimes weak, other times moderate.  Might be best to just order a beer.  Ambiance is exactly what you can expect from a sports bar with cute waitress girls in cute outfits.    A OK is how everything sums up.  I will most likely be back."}
{"text":"Sadly - I went on a Wednesday and it seemed pretty quiet.    This is not like the one in Columbus.   I met some folks after work and everyone who worked there looked tired.    There was a Pirates Game but that did not really draw a crowd.   I saw more people further North of the Pirates Stadium than this location.  I will give another chance but my first impression after being at other Kilts was not a good one."}
{"text":"Get your Braveheart on...   This place is exactly mid-way to where I now live from work.     What makes this place fun are the bartenders .    There is usually a good crowd during the week.     The food is okay -  I recommend the boneless wings in Tilted Kilt Sauce and one of their flatbread pizzas - Buffalo Chicken / Blue Cheese.  During the summer - they have a covered patio with TVs to watch sports."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for dinner one night since we recently moved to the area and trying some local spots. We came in on a Friday and decided to sit at the bar. The bartender quickly came over and took our drink order and then once we decided on eats she took that order as well. I had the Drunken Clams off the app menu and my boyfriend had a burger. Our food came out fairly quickly and was very good.  While sitting there we did notice how empty the place was for a Friday at 7pm. It also looks like they have a nice patio for the cooler days/nights. I know we will be back as the food was good and so was the service."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars this place deserves it!! They can't get their TVs right to save their lives. There is a TV playing CSI when there are countless games on! 4 of us are drinking and were going to eat, but we can't take this anymore and had to leave. We also spoke with the manager who said \"I can't do anything\". Good bye to our business!"}
{"text":"I came here the other night for the first time as we had some friends visiting and we always go to Yardhouse so we wanted to try something new.  I truly wasn't impressed.  We sat down and the whole experience was rushed.  The server kept coming to our table too quickly and only half of us were ready to order.    We ordered a few beers and I had an ancho chile margarita.  Our server didn't fill my water glass once and I drink a lot of water.    We then ordered.  I got the Fried Egg Burger with a side of the Mac & Chz, 2 others got black bean burgers, and we all shared the sampler to start.  The sampler took forever to come out.  It was truly mediocre at best.  It was a bunch of over fried stuff.  When our food came out the Mac & chz was not hot at all.  I will say, the server was nice and got us a new one.    I couldn't tell if it was her fault or if they had her working too many tables but she was just all over the place and seemed to have too many people to take care of.  I think this would be a good place to go have drinks and watch a game at the bar but anything beyond that you're better off at Yardhouse in the same area!"}
{"text":"Grear atmosphere and everyone friendly.  The food was very good and a great selection of craft beers"}
{"text":"Hooters more or less. Plenty of eye candy and terrible food. The mix drinks are terrible. Beer only."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back to this restaurant if they comped me a dinner for four. Not only was the food mediocre, mushy stew with some flavorless meat they call beef and soggy fish and chips, but the degrading sexist treatment of the waitstaff is not to be supported. Why can't the male owners understand that forcing women into skimpy, breasts falling out, costumes is as humiliating and misogynist as the Taliban forcing women to wear burkas? Had I known it was an \"Irish Hooters\" I would have never walked in."}
{"text":"I came in for just a quick bite. Super-surprised to find the NHL network on one of the TVs. Also a good beer selection. But the best surprise was to be served the best fish tacos I've ever eaten! Totally recommended!  Attentive and cute waitress too. ;)"}
{"text":"My friends and I were struggling trying to find a place that was playing an NCAA game downtown, but that wasn't completely booked. That's where the 3 stars come in.   Tilted Kilt answered our phone call quickly and accurately. Once we got there, we got seated right away and all servers were friendly...specially because one of my friends spilled water everywhere and we had to switch tables.   The minus 2 stars comes from the food. Yes, we expected bar food, and although the taste was good (particularly the fried pickles & loaded tots), the food didn't sit well with any of our stomachs.   Although the service was great, all of us getting sick left a sour taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"Food was gross. We left after only eating a few bites. Server was nice. Not surprised it's closed now."}
{"text":"This use to be my neighborhood drink spot  then they went out of business and Tilted Kilt moved in. They did zero renovating and looks nothing like the other ones. The atmosphere is awkward and you feel as if you should be in a classy latin bar that existed there before. The food sucks and the girls are beat. They should step it up to hooters if they don't care about morals or clothing. This was created for the fathers of Paradise Valley/Scottsdale to get away from their wives and family and stare at young woman's tits and ass. Tilted Kilt PV=Fail."}
{"text":"Visited for the first and last time yesterday. Arrived and sat at the bar only to wait (no exaggeration) 15 minutes to be acknowledged. I felt like my friend and I were in a bad movie. \"Whadaya want\" said the 6 foot muscleman behind the bar. One Dos Equis and one bud light were ordered. I asked the bartender what he recommended for lunch and the following just amazed me: \"It's all good dude\" as he finished his conversation with a fellow employee about how he can't get enough hours. \"Gee I wonder why\"?. Anyway, after ordering a pastrami sandwich which came quickly we began to feel the pain of our decision to drop in. The bread was hard and the meat was dry. The bartender didn't provide us with silverware or plates. I thought maybe he was trying to piss me off... I dunno. Finally another waitress checked on us and set us up. Mind you, I know it was  Sunday football right? but the bar area wasn't busy...now I know why. Service sucks!!! I spoke with Todd Manger: the assistant gen manager. Said he would take sandwich off the bill but felt like he just wanted to get rid of me.... which was fine. SO... $14.00 for 2 draft beers that I could have had down the street at a dive for 4 bucks with more personality. Don't go here. You'll be sorry"}
{"text":"Their TK signature sauce on their wings always hits the spot. Only complaint is i paid $7 for a pint for Kiltlifter where everywhere else has it for $5..."}
{"text":"For any guy who does not know about this place you should check it out. It has a good bar area, and the food isn't bad. This place knows the key to success and goes with the age old adage of \"sex sells\". The waitress' all dress to impress in kilts and tight shirts which is cool. However they are not just there for show, they do a great job and never leave you with an empty cup.  Very cool place to check out."}
{"text":"The Tilted Kilt won the toss up between them and the Hard Rock for dinner and drinks before a concert across the street. Upon arrival we were told the wait time was approximately 20 to 30 minutes and being a busy Saturday night, we totally understood and decided to order a couple drinks and enjoy the view from the outside balcony while we waited. After 45 minutes had passed, I asked the hostess for an update and was told it would be another 10 minutes or so. After another 15 minutes I got a text on my phone saying \" Your table is ready, please see your host to be seated!\"  It all went downhill from there. We stood at the hostess station for nearly 10 minutes before she got around to taking us to our table, and when we got to our table....NO CHAIRS! I asked jokingly \" Do we get chairs ?\" She turned and left the room to, I assume, look for some. Another couple 2 tables over offered us the 2 chairs they weren't using.  A slogan constantly shown on one of the many TVs says \"nothing looks better than a cold beer\" which inspired my wife to order a Guinness which in turn was delivered in a nice warm plastic cup while my water was in a nice cold glass. We ordered some nachos for an appetizer and when our server returned a few minutes later, she asked if we wanted to order anything else. I got a bbq bacon cheese burger with a side of rings and my wife got a philly of some sort. Another 10 minutes go by and she brings the burger and sandwich. \"No nachos?\", I asked. \"They didn't bring them?\", she asked. She turned to walk away and I said to just take them off the bill and we'd just eat what we have. My wife's sandwich looked very good and she had no complaints. The burger, while looking good, had a bun that was either stale or  over toasted and nearly void of bbq sauce and the onion rings were undercooked and on the soggy side.   Now I always say that if you don't bring the problem up to the staff when something is not right, you can't complain bout it later. But our server never came back around till she brought the check and I was starving, so nearly half my food was gone. And when I looked at the bill....the nachos were still on it!  My overall opinion is that this place is a Hooters with Irish decor that thinks having its help show a ton of cleavage and belly buttons would make up for shoddy service and mediocre (at best) food. It did not. I've had better burgers and service at a Denny's.    One star because my wife ate her entire sandwich."}
{"text":"Bacon blue cheeseburger and onion rings with cayenne ranch. Nice location for sitting outside, not a lot of traffic noise"}
{"text":"Brian S. Sum's it up perfectly with \"if you're going to try to be a Hooters/Library sports bar rip-off, hire more attractive, more in-shape waitresses to wear those cheesy uniforms.\"  The only reason I give it a second star is because it's so close to home and they're open till 2, so I can't hate totally."}
{"text":"Got an invitation to watch the opening season OU GAME...Got there early. Although crowded w OU fans already... Found a good seat. Soon learned... Sadly that the OU game wouldn't be heard on the sound but the ASU game would. Hmmm... You can watch ASU anywhere in the valley and hear that game, but the OU game was pay per view AND this bar advertised it would have it. So now we are there to see the game (along with A LOT of other fans) but we won't be able to hear it.  Very confusing to watch a game but hear the play by play of a different game. A very disappointing evening to say the least. And to top it off... The owner of Tilted Kilt is supposed to be an OU grad. This is advertised as an OU bar.... NOT!!!  Our server... Aria was great. Nachos were nachos. Many customers were very unhappy."}
{"text":"This bar is great, the food is delicious, the chicken wings are on point. The Dj is dope, Dj Rskee puts it down. Great atmosphere, good place to chill. Awesome place, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We went to this Tilted Kilt while in town for a convention and at the time had no idea it was a franchise nor the theme of the waitstaff's attire. That being said the food was good and reasonably priced and the \"view\" was great for our group of 30 something men. I have seen it compared to Hooters but based on our experience I would choose the Kilt every time."}
{"text":"Warm beer, they run out of beer glasses so after a 30 min wait you get one fresh from dishwasher.  Service is cute and horrible.  This place sucks!  Manager sent someone to buy glasses so then they will wash them and serve warm beer.  They offer WiFi, but it doesn't work.  Manager does not care so don't waste time.  We asked a passing Server if she could take the 9 glasses at a table of 6, she said  \"You need to ask your server\".  They serve flat beer too!  See pic  The Manager messaged me on here and said beer comes out at 32 degrees...really?  I asked to come see me and 30 mins later he has not shown up.  Fresh beer, what a joke."}
{"text":"Good times good food ok service requires long ass message to check in. So i am just adding words until it accepts the post"}
{"text":"J-o-k-e.  don't waste your time. Wouldn't feed the food to my dog.  Annoying, completely phony waitress.  Asked us every 12 seconds if we needed anything else with a ditzy little giggle and fake grin. Sad."}
{"text":"What a horrible place. We  went in for dinner and drinks Saturday night and place was pretty dead. We had a party of 8. We ordered drinks, apps and dinner all at once. Girl came And forgot half our drink order and a couple were wrong. This was at least 20 waiting time on the drinks.  Another 20 minutes have passed and we still had no apps and no food. We told them we were going to leave and waitress said \"ok\", that's it. We dropped $20 and walked out.  Never again. Surprised they have 2 stars on yelp...they should have zero or less"}
{"text":"Pros: Servers are terrific and are pretty hot (that's pretty much the point of this place), but more so than that is that they have so many TVs that pretty much any game you want to watch will be available to watch.   Cons: The food is blagh. It tasted like eating leftovers that weren't warmed up properly.   Overall, it's a 3.5, but I'll give it 4 (instead of 3) because our server was so attentive. It's the level of service that the wait staff in all restaurants should strive for."}
{"text":"Service was good and fast. The food was a mixed bag. For an appetizer I ordered a chicken quesadilla which was surprisingly good,  the salsa was bland and sweet. For the meal we ordered cheeseburgers, mine was dublined with an egg. The fries were good and the onion rings were tasty. The burgers well...we ordered medium, got medium well to well done. They were partially burnt and had a very dry texture. The brioche buns were also burnt on the edges. The only positive I can say was my egg was perfect. I would rank them higher at a three but let us be honest here. A burger is a ubiquitous and simple meal and even at the most run down of places should be done right and these werent."}
{"text":"good beer selection - pretty decent food for a bar. service is random."}
{"text":"Overall, this place sucks!  You're basically coming in for the girls I guess.  Food sucks, Drinks are ehhhhh...   you paid for what you get. Happy Hour is what we ordered, and was not HAPPY!  I guess, if you here watching Football, Baseball, or Basketball, then I guess it's ok...  Other than that, Don't come here for the food!! Service was Aight too.. NOT the greatest and friendliest staff either. I rather go to hooters if anything....Heeeeh."}
{"text":"I like how every girl on here gives this place 1 star, and the guys usually give it 3 stars.  That says a lot, bc if there is one hting i know about guys it is that they freaking love boobs.  The Tilted Kilt has boobs everywhere.  More than a strip club.  So many boobs I wondered if it was a health code violation.  So it having 3 or 4 star reviews from dudes tells you this is a 1 star restaurant.  It should be no surprise that I was out with a guy and I did NOT pick this place.  In fact, I'm pretty sure no girl in the history of girls has ever said, \"I want a fish sandwich and to stare at tits.\"    Our waitress was very nice, and I've got to say that if my body looked like hers, I'd be wearing the Tilted Kilt uniform daily, whether i worked there or not.  We had hamburgers.  They were standard hamburgers.  WHAT IS IT WITH RESTAURANT HAMBURGER BUNS????  Once again, the bun was MASSIVE nad htat drives me crazy.  However, the hambuger was so greasy the bun immediately became full of oil and shrank down.  Kinda gross, but also kind of impressive.  That was an absorbent bun!  The place was wildly over priced and I don't know how anyone could sit there and watch an entire game and drink all night.  If you want to piss your wife off, do that.  Go to the Tilted Kilt and drink all night, then tell her that's where you were all night and that your bar tab was $150.  I think it might be less expensive to go to a strip club.  Go to one with a buffet, and save some money.  The food was meh, the waitress was ok, the tits were large, the drinks were expensive.   -Fin-"}
{"text":"My friend and I went on a Saturday evening, entering the establishment to a virtually empty venue. It appears that the novelty of young lasses in those low cut uniforms is wearing off.  There is no compensation in the food or service. Alas, a pint of import is $8.50?! I'm addition, there is an upgrade fee of $2.00 for sweet potato fries to accompany a sad $13.50 sandwich with au jus.   The server was advised that my friend didn't like mayo, and I jokingly said that he would \"die\" if he ate it- guess what, he had to return his chicken because it was slathered in mayo?   Overall, it is worth going at least once, but the exaggerated pricing scheme loses its lustre after the first visit."}
{"text":"Monday night before Christmas after a Cavs game. Wanted to see scantily clad ladies, which we did. Decent beer selection, decent girl selection, and the food (roasted garlic fries) was fine. Hard to go wrong w beer and boobs"}
{"text":"This coming from a 23-year old, bisexual girl, I feel completely unbiased about this, just an FYI to those worried about my credibility as a woman. I had a horrible first experience and will NOT return. I'm a frequenter of The Flying Saucer in University City and was told by some that it was a similar experience; it is NOT! The waitress we had was like a bipolar cheerleader. She was perky to the point of annoyance until my boyfriend found a couple of hairs in his food after a couple bites of his burger. Then it was rudely, \"Well, where's the hair? I don't see anything\" and she acted as if we were horribly trying to screw her over for the rest of the night. She barely talked to us and her perky attitude came off as completely fake the rest of the night. The girls aren't required to pull their hair back obviously, so it's not a surprise to me that a hair wound up in the food. We didn't get an apology for the problem and then she tried charging us for a side of BBQ sauce that was so disgusting he didn't touch it, and even came with the burger he didn't eat. The food was mediocre and nothing special in any regard and the beer selection was just average compared to a lot of other places in Charlotte. My friend just moved to South Charlotte and was looking forward to a good pub-style atmosphere and he made it clear to me that he would rather drive 30 minutes to the Flying Saucer for better food, better service and MUCH better beer selection than just 10 minutes to a lousy bar/restaurant with annoying waitresses, average food and none of the beers we like. Maybe we'll try Mac's when we're in South Charlotte. Hopefully the service will be better and there won't be any hair problems. The only thing this place had going for it was the highly revealing costumes the waitresses were wearing, but if that's the only thing it had going for it, I'd rather go to a strip club."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The waitress legitimately ignored me on at least two occasions. I made sure there was no way she could miss me. I would have been fine with \"I'll be right over in a minute\" but completely ignored? Really? The place wasn't even half full either and there was plenty of staff. Judging by other review this is common. There was another customer complaining, ironically,  and we got our check right before we got up to complain (we waited a minimum of 15 minutes for the waitress to pick up the check, and once again, it wasn't busy at all).  There was a table that several waitresses kept going over to and just socialize. Other employees maybe. They definitely all knew each other. Our waitress was there twice when she was supposed to be getting us something. I had already predicted that she \"forgot\".  The food was nothing special and not really worth the money. There's many better similar options in the area. I would go back just to drink sometime, but after the terrible service there's no chance in hell. I'm not hard to please and as long as effort is shown I'm fine but they didn't even try."}
{"text":"Just tried calling the number provided 6 times with no answer.   No voicemail either.  Not sure what's going on, but I guess I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Server was great too bad her manager was a spineless dweeb and the cooks either can't read or don't give a crap. Seems like a lot of not giving a crap going on, there were still posters advertising for last week's fight, the floor is filthy, the first chair I tried to sit in had dried up food stuck to it, needless to say we had a horrible experience and should not have drove 45 minutes just for Tilted Kilt... NEVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"The check in coupon here is a scam! It's expired! WTF?!  First off I was not happy to see they have a check in coupon still advertised on yelp and not willing to honor it. It's not anyone's fault but the businesses that they are not clearly managing their yelp account properly. The coupon was for some complimentary fries with a purchase of an entree. I could careless about the fries, it's the point that I care about.   The service seem to be pretty good the staff is very up beat and friendly. The atmosphere here was really cool. We came during the football games on a Sunday, and man was there a lot of hype and energy there.   The food was pretty good, I ordered the wings with a kilt lifter beer. All in all I had a good time except for the whole not honoring the yelp check in coupon."}
{"text":"Love watching football here on Sundays! They have TVs everywhere!!! EVERYWHERE!!!  The food is way better than hooters! The ladies are more fun to look at here, and the bar is unlike anything I have seen before. It's the shape of the bar that makes it so interesting! I am a huge fan of this place!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten me so much food and drink at such a reasonable price.  I would consider an upscale version of hooters on steroids.  The staff is great and the people I've met were amazing. I would definitely recommend coming here whether you're a tourist, or a regular. A+ to the max!!!"}
{"text":"Very slow service and so so food.  Good looking menu but will not be back."}
{"text":"My first experience here wasn't bad at all, but we were just having beers and watching \"the game\". It was pretty busy, but we found a place to sit at the bar. Lots of TVs. Girls are really nice. Cool. Solid 3 stars.   However, this last visit was really irritating! The food was not that great - the french dip was pretty bland, and the garlic fries were just soggy but at least had some flavor. The worst part is that the service was waaaay too slow and there were maybe 15 - 20 people dining in the restaurant at the time. So this time around, they are averaging a 2 for me. If I ever come back, it'll just be drinks and the TVs!"}
{"text":"Service was subpar, food was over cooked, tried asking manager question and he didn't seem to really care. Won't be back to a Tilted Kilt as just too loud!"}
{"text":"Came in at 945. Place advertised as closing at 12. Just a few people sitting in the bar. Kitchen is apparently closed so no food.  Doesn't look welcoming or friendly. Just a big empty dank space."}
{"text":"What a let down this place was. Firstly it stinks in there like who ever is cleaning has not used clean fresh water and soap in years. Weird. It's was empty maybe three staff working the floor, two bar tenders but had to wait 5mins for a drink while the staff talked to each other. Won't be back which is a shame as other tilted kilt bars I have been too were great."}
{"text":"This place is okay nothing special but a great place if your into sports bars and scantily clad women. I was here with a male friend and ordered the veggie burger wrap with sweet potato fries  .. For a sports bar the food wasn't too bad. Our waitress was attentive and the food wasn't bad.."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before our show.  The place was busy but service was quick.  The food was good.  The beer was super cold.  The wings were tasty.  I had a salad; my husband and brother in law had burgers and fries.  It was certainly in a convenient location."}
{"text":"The girls are nice, they know how to make you feel special, the food is good too. I had the bbq bacon burger with sweet potato fries. Moderately pricey but I'd go again if invited."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I agree with both Joshua W. and Terry M.  Definitely a much higher ratio of guys to girls here (I'm guessing that's due to the waitress and bartenders outfits:  very short kilt-like skirts and low cut tops).  The food is above average pub fare, and the bar selection is very good.  The service, however, is poor.  I've gone there a few times, mostly due to its location, and unless you are sitting at the bar, the service has been attrocious.  Let me rephrase that, if you are a couple, the service is merely below-average, but if you are a couple of guys, it has if you are wearing your cloak of invisibility.  The last couple of times I noticed that there seemed to be some regulars who the servers congregated around (sometimes 3-4 servers at a time), while the rest of the patrons were basically ignored."}
{"text":"I've reviewed the location on Bell Road, and have been to this one as well.  Nice place to have a bite to eat and watch a game on the multitude of tv screens.  Due to the scantily clad female servers, not a place to bring kids, and I wouldn't choose it as a date location (although my wife is not offended going here).  The food is good, but not great.  They used to have steamers, which were excellent, but they've dropped them from the menu.  Their pastrami sandwich was very good, but needed to have about twice to thrice the amount of meat.  The Irish stew was very good.  Their selection of draft beer makes this a good place to quench your thirst."}
{"text":"I love chicken wings and the ones here are amazing. Tons of big screen TVs. Great place to watch a game.  Service was great too!  Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because some people might be uncomfortable with the servers outfits."}
{"text":"I usually go during lunchtime or games on weekends and have no issues. The service is pretty good but could be improved upon. Good selection of food and drink, nice views from the patio. Some of the staff needs to hit the gym next door but other than that it's great."}
{"text":"Pretty good bar food. Great service, friendly and quick. Guinness was poured just like Dublin Ireland.    We went as a very large group of 30+ for Bday party with prior reservation. They accommodated all, multiple servers, nice job. They also split all checks when requested.    Use free coupon for Irish chips, not a bad little appetizer.   Casino is right across street."}
{"text":"It's an 'OU' bar because the owners are fans......change the stinkim channel to Pac 12 and turn the sound onto something else and consider the customers wants instead"}
{"text":"Food is OK for a pub but the location is awesome.  Great spot pre or post ACC games."}
{"text":"I would not recommend eating here. They have 3 Irish dishes on the menu. We started of by ordering Irish nachos with jalapenos. When they arrived, they were less than impressive, not hot and didn't have jalapenos, so when we placed our food order I requested the jalapenos. We ordered grilled wings with half the order guiness bbq, the other half TK sauce along with a salad adding grilled chicken. Never got the jalapenos and when the food was delivered only one sauce was on the extremely fatty wings and the salad had less than half a chicken breast on it which cost and additional $7 ( I think don't remember and the receipt it's not detailed). I normally don't write reviews unless it's really great our really bad. This place is not somewhere to dine."}
{"text":"In the world of \"fetish\" food this chain is quickly climbing the rankings.  The food here is a nice change of pace from other chain restaurants in downtown Cleveland. The service is friendly and the staff is encouraged to join you at your table for some small talk.   Service was quick and scenery was surprisingly good for Northeast Ohio."}
{"text":"The staff and management here are great. Very attentive and nice. The food was mediocre. The biggest issue was the screw that I bit into in my burger. The management handled it well so I have nothing bad to say about the staff but I probably won't return."}
{"text":"As far as chain restaurants go this is a pretty good one I've been to tilted kilts in Pittsburgh ,Cleveland  Denver and now Vegas ... It's  a good sports bar with plenty of tv's and some pretty good food"}
{"text":"This place will become the next Hooters.  In fact I have a friend who calls this place \"Celtic Hooters\".  The first week it is open and it is packed.  In fact it is always busy, which makes for a fun experience.  The servers are in the magical 19-20 age range (old enough to serve, not quite old enough to drink) range.  Pretty girls, who will make small talk with business men.  As a female, getting service here is a bit tougher. I would advise going straight to the bar.  The food is standard pub fare, they have a good beer collection along with ciders.  Overall, you come here with a group of friends, lots of televisions.  Good place for a basic HH with friends you want to see but not actually talk to (it is pretty noisy in there), and face it, the pretty girls in reallly really small outfits are distracting, (and I'm a girl).  There are lots of servers, but like I mentioned, the girls really chat up the patrons, so you may or may not get speedy service."}
{"text":"The Tilted Kilt has a reputation for being akin to a vaguely-Scottish-themed Hooters: that is, most people go there for visual rather than gustatory pleasures. Therefore, I never really had an interest in checking out Matthews' new Titled Kilt, since the flesh on display isn't really according to my tastes.  Last week, however, we were looking for something to eat. We didn't want to drive too far, and we were bored with most of the other nearby options. I recalled someone telling me that the Tilted Kilt actually had decent food, so off we went, albeit with some trepidation.  It turns out that, unlike when they are talking about Hooters, when people say that the Tilted Kilt has good food, they are actually being truthful. My blue cheese burger was quite tasty, and the onion rings were delicious. I've had better burgers, but I don't know that I've had a better burger in Matthews, so there you go. I did feel a little self-conscious, as the restaurant's crowd was quite obviously 98% boob-ogling men, but our waitress was sweet and prompt, and we left satisfied.   What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after hearing great things, and was disappointed. Usually before heading out, i tend to check a restaurant's website - and decide ahead of time what id like to have. The reason i was disappointed had nothing to do with the service, but more was due to false advertising on the website.  Most of the stuff that we were interested in getting tonight, was not available on the menu at this location. These items include the Hot mess burger, the double D burger as well as the pork mac and cheese. My advice if you want to try this place - call ahead of time and make sure what you want is available. Its disappointing when you make a trip out and waste Gas to not get what it was you had in mind.  My advice for Tilted Kilt - please update your website along with your menu.  Because of this, i decided not to get anything, and left after having the appetizer. Guinness wings were great.  I felt bad, because the waitress was super nice, however after we decided not to get anything more her whole demeanor changed and we could tell she got upset for us leaving.  wont be back."}
{"text":"I can't speak for what The Tilted Kilt is like in the evenings, but I've been there many times for lunch and seldom been disappointed. If you disregard this bar out of hand for their scantily-clad-waitress-Scottish-theme shtick, you're doing it a disservice.   I've had their Shepherd's pie, which is very good if you're looking for a more substantial lunch, but I keep coming back to their Black and Blue burger- Simply a blackened patty with blue cheese. Their BBQ burger is also good. I can't put my finger on what it is, but I like me some Tilted Kilt burgers.   There aren't any huge surprises here. Tilted Kilt is a chain, and primarily a bar, so there is going to be the usual bar fare with a Scottish twist.   The service has always ranged from good to outstanding when I've gone. And on that note let me relate a story: My co-worker ordered a well done burger, and his arrived rare. He politely said, \"I can't eat this.\" That is all he said. Not only did  the waitress apologize and replace his order, the manager came by the table and apologized, they comped his meal, asked if he wanted a beer (since they were buying!), and gave him a gift card to pay for his next visit. I've seldom seen this kind of customer service, and I was impressed."}
{"text":"So I've been to three of these (downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale and this one in Tempe).  It's basically Irish Hooters without the pantyhose.  The food is decent, if you're there get the Irish nachos because they're always a hit (fresh potato chips + ground sausage / cheese sauce / fresh tomatoes).  I just feel like here, more so than any Hooters or Twin Peaks I've been to, the girls aren't particularly friendly or attentive.  Of course there are exceptions to the rule, but let's just be honest - most of the time when a group decides to come here it's for the scenery.  Flirty and friendly behavior will almost always equal bigger tips - but I feel like here more than the other boobie themed joints the girls / management don't get that concept.  If you're here for a sporting event, you can get a giant tower of beer that they bring to the table and that's actually pretty cool.  I suppose what I am saying is, I don't like it when places half ass their concept.  If you're going to have scantily clad ladies serving food and drink, they should make an effort to entice you to come back - rather than remind you that they're all aware how attractive and unattainable they are."}
{"text":"Great food, strong drinks, good atmosphere and I love the kilt/skirt thing. They are almost school girls outfits. We went at the heart of lunch today and we seated right away. The servers were confused as to whos table it was but \"that is cute right\" It must be rough being a cute girl.   We have been to all of the T.K in AZ, they are all consistant and employ good looking and nice waitresses."}
{"text":"I like tilted kilt.  The food is always just ok  The drinks are usually good.   The servers are usually good.   I like the kilt attire.   We had some apps: nachos, the fixins are ok, chips got soggy wings, good but nothing great sausage bites, good but you only can eat 1 or 2 cheese sticks, meh they are there rings, looked ok  I had a burger and it was better then in the past. It was missing the cheese, lettuce and tom but the meat was good.   The meal was free but the prices were ok.   3.5 rounded up for good service and views."}
{"text":"I visited this place with family after my graduation ceremony as it was closest to the Sony Center and we had just parked right across from it. We got a bunch of appetizers, wings, nachos, spinach dip and didn't find them to be all that bad. It is standard pub food though so you get what you get. The place was pretty busy that day as it was the start of the World Cup.   The server was really great and I think kept distracting my 8 year old nephew at the time with their uniforms. Not the most kid friendly atmosphere to be in for kids but he enjoyed himself there too.   One thing in particular I enjoyed was the complimentary baked cookie with ice cream I got as a Congratulations from them. Usually you expect to get one of the cheapest desserts on the menu that end up being tiny however this dessert served best for all 6 of us that were there.   Kudos to the Tilted Kilt for not being stingy."}
{"text":"3 words:  disgusting, disgusting, and fucking disgusting. Oh wait, that was 4."}
{"text":"Someone needs to alert corporate.  I show up on a Friday 6pm. 3 guys, yes I said 3 guys, are working the bar.  Not a tilted Kilt girl can be found behind the bar.  So many other options in Pitt for a good bar."}
{"text":"When we first arrived we were seat quickly and received our drinks in a reasonable amount of time.  It took a while to get our food but it took forever to get our bill. We sat a waited and waited. Our waitress was at another table which had a large party and pretty much ignored us. After about 20 minutes I asked another waitress for our bill and she asked us what we had and attempted to figure out what everyone had. I gave my money to the first waitress and she went to the register, got my change and put it in the black bill folder and put it under her arm.  She then went to other tables and began taking orders and again ignored us. We didn't get our change until I asked the supervisor to get it for me. Very disappointing evening with frustration on our last evening of our visit to Phoenix. Probably never visit another Tilted Kilt due to the way we were ignored."}
{"text":"We came here with a few of my friends after riding on the Linq.  We were looking for a place to grab a beer and food.  We came here because of the no wait time which Yardhouse was on a 15 min wait.  We might have chosen wrong.  The place is a nice pub with all high seating but the tables had to many items on them and made it hard for 3 people to sit.  Our server was Julianne and she was very friendly and nice.  The women dress like school girls and it might be a little over done for a place to enjoy food.  We ordered the \"Irish Nachos\" where HORRIBLE!  They were made of pub cheese and just meat. Avoid the nachos because you will be sad like I was! They were not worth any amount of money.  I had the \"Spicy Mother Clucker\" which was good sandwich and the french fries were nothing special.  Overall my experience was just ok.  I would not come back due to the fact the food was nothing special and the server was just average.   I got the feeling this place will not last long."}
{"text":"Well, if you want titilation,  this is your place. Besides that,  it's a bar and serves drinks and has scantily clad women...what more do you want?"}
{"text":"Out right disgusted with the Service I received. Came in to a read headed girl i believe her name was Jess or Jaylynn; she was with 3 others at the front she had turned her back towards me while i was waiting to be seated, didn't greet me or anything while walking in, once finally seated she began to play with her nose and eyes while walking away and then brought us our drinks. I didn't see her wash her hands. The food was amazing and our other server was amazing but considering that i didn't feel welcomed first coming in and also the fact of how our drinks were handled makes me wonder if i should ever come back in!"}
{"text":"Quick, attentive service. The wings were like drumsticks. Cooked to perfection. My son destroyed his salmon. Oh and the scenery was nice too."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times, the first time it took the waitress/bartender around 10 mins to greet us. They were not busy at all. The 2nd time my friends and I showed up sat at 11am and we were one of the first ones in there. Once again the service was really bad and it took over 45 mins for our lunch to come out! She said the kitchen kept messing up my friends meal that's what took so long so she comped his meal but not ours???we had to wait to!!!overall the food is okay the service is bad!"}
{"text":"Been to this location a couple of times, and it is always fun! Got here on a Saturday night round 11:30 pm and the place was full, stayed until it closed. THANK YOU for having multiple Sam Adams on tap!!! Arizona is tough to find Sammy A. Place is just always fun, girls are always nice to look at. I believe what makes this a 4 star instead of 3, is that the hot bartenders actually can carry a conversation with you and not just stand there and be hot."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a drink when we were strolling around the North Shore. Now I know to keep walking and go somewhere else! Having my server be objectified in basically a bra and mini-skirt is not my thing. Maybe the fact that I have boobs gives me a bias...I'm also assuming they are not technically an equal opportunity employer due to the specifics of the uniform. I can just picture their hiring ad now...\"Wanted: Attractive, big-breasted, small waisted women. All others need not apply.\" Ugh.  Besides disliking the male chauvinist ambiance, this place is expensive to drink. Not sure what it's like during happy hour, but the only special they had when we were there was a bucket of 5 Yuengling bottles bottles for $15. Our server told us it's a great deal because none of the other drinks were less than $6.50, not even any shots.  If your computer isn't cutting  it anymore and you're desperate for some real-life boobs crammed into a 2 sizes too small push-up bra, you'll love this place! I'll take a fully-clothed server and some craft beer elsewhere."}
{"text":"Friends and I looked for a place to hold our annual fantasy football draft and Tilted Kilt was picked. After lots of Yelp research, this location provided us with a private room, a draft board, a food discount, and outlets (HDMI and power). Yep, for one night I was a fantasy football geek. Oh who am I kidding, I am always a fantasy sports geek. Anyway, the room was great and offered us plenty of space for 15. The service was very good with no issues to note. As for the food, I ordered their fish tacos and was shocked how good they were. The fish was moist and the sauce was plentiful (often not the case with fish tacos) and tasty. I elected for fries over chips and they too were good. Overall, very good meal that I was not expecting.  My only complaint about the whole experience was the Internet. Numerous times throughout our online draft the Internet cut out. Fortunately it did not impact selections but it did provide scares from time to time. Being a dorky fantasy sport guy again, sorry."}
{"text":"After a great time at Copper Blues I wound up here. Pretty lackluster experience and this is sad because I had high hopes for this place. There was nothing blatantly bad about my experience but the vibe, the clientele, everything about just kind of sucked. There was nothing about the vibe or atmosphere that made me want to stay...in fact I left after one beer.  The place just opened up, so it's quite possible that everyone is stil getting their bearings so I'll probably pop in one more time in a few months to see if the vibe is the same.   The bar is indoor/outdoor and opens onto a a concrete patio that is definitely the best feature at this location. The patio has awesom eastern views of downtown and it's really cool in the late afternoon early evenings. Unfortunately they HAVE to do something about the patio high chairs because they are uncomfortable as hell."}
{"text":"Saturday night was  young, and so it was off to the Tilted Kitten! Think of it as your pub version of Hooters......if that makes sense. However just dropping by for drinks. Based on my overall experience this place is a 3/5.  Our patio section was way too jam packed! but the service was definitely up to par! and their sweet potato fries are yummy!!! To give this place a more in depth review ill have to revisit it again.   Service: 5/5 Food: 3/5 Ambience: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5"}
{"text":"I'm going to start out saying that I should have read reviews prior to eating breakfast here. My fiancee and I had walked over to go to the Hash a Go Go breakfast, but there was a really long wait. We walked down the alley and saw the Twisted Kilt. There were barely any customers. We looked on the menu and there were 5 breakfast items. Who can mess up breakfast? Let me answer that... the Twisted Kilt can. Our server finally came over after we had been seated about 20 minutes... literally there were 2 other tables. We ordered coffee and French toast and the Twisted breakfast (eggs, sausage, bacon, toast and hash browns). We waited FOREVER for the coffee. Then waited forever for sugar and cream. Finally a male server delivered the food. No utensils. I have no idea what our server was doing.  ..socializing apparently. He got us silverware.  The French toast was fine, but ruined by the fake maple syrup. Gross! Hash browns weren't special,  just fried potatoes. My fiancee didn't touch his sausage, it was bland. His eggs and toast were already cold. No butter for his toast either. He asked, but never got it. We had to call for our server to get coffee refills. She NEVER asked how the meal was... ever. I will never go to another Twisted Kilt...too many other options. I recommend any other restaurant or going hungry."}
{"text":"Your typical place for Irish restaurant grill that serves the usual. More of a sporty place with TVs and girls dressed in short skirts and showing lots of cleavage.  The food is ok if not pricey. Even the appetizers are pricey and almost as much as the regular items. You're better off getting the regular items.  This is in a good location in downtown right across the street from the arenas and ball fields so it's definitely convenient place to walk to. Definitely not convenient during or after a ball game because it might be packed."}
{"text":"I will begin with the good. Our server was great! I had 40 minutes to eat, it was packed and she was able to get my food out and followed through with my request for the check when I ordered and had it processed so I could eat and run! Thank you!  The French Dip? Was good, I am gluten free and ate it without the bun and was flavorful. I liked the hand cut chips and the price was fair for The Linq area. My friends beer, $9. I refuse to pay that much for a draught beer.  This is a sports bar, it is loud, there are guys yelling, the volume is high on the TV's so expect noise!  The windows were open, and it was hot, so do not expect to escape the heat. I am sure they have some kind of air on, we were both warm.   The tables are tight so the woman behind us had to bump our table twice to get in and out. If you or someone in your party is large, sit strategically   Me personally, I am not a fan, however, if I had friends in town that were sports fans and they were at The Linq, I would send them, it is just not for me."}
{"text":"Service 0 stars. Food 0 stars. Ambience 0 stars. Beer 1 star. And only cause they let my buddies Guiness settle.  Unless you like to be served crappy food and ignored by your waitress than run as fast as possible...to The Moon Saloon, right next door."}
{"text":"Review is for a place for Steelers pregame only-  Ended up here before the game, great outdoor patio, no bathroom lines, quick drink service and the NFL Sunday Ticket on the TVs. Like the outdoor bar/patio seats.  Good place before the game"}
{"text":"The best place to go in downtown Phoenix. Have tried a bunch of things on the menu all were delicious. Service here is always great."}
{"text":"Friendly service even though the servers' outfits are a little bit over the top.  Nice cold beers on tap.  Got a chicken wrap to be a little healthier and it was surprisingly tasty."}
{"text":"Been waiting on are server to come back with our drinks for about 25 minutes. Still nothing and my friend had to get the menus"}
{"text":"Great place!! Food was wonderful.. Burgers ,  the chicken sandwich and wings were great!! Only issue was that it was understaffed during lunch so it was a a bit of a wait but not TOO much.. It was doable... Def will return!!  And came with the fam they all loved it!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to go watch some sports if you are in Las Vegas. They had screens everywhere. The bartenders were cool and knew their drinks. I would definitely visit this spot again if I went back to Vegas."}
{"text":"I must admit that the steak salad I ordered was pretty tasty for pub food. My steak was made medium rare and the salad dressing was not overwhelming. Thank you Yelp for your fabulous YELP deal you had going on as I was able to get the salad and a beer just shy of $20 ( the deal was for $12 for $20) The staff are friendly, even while it was a tad cold in there, everyone still had a smile on their face. It is not a place I visit often but everyone has always been nice and the food decent. Definitely try that steak salad if you get a chance. Worth the $13!"}
{"text":"Front desk reception totally unfriendly, but food was good. Table service was good.  Our waitress was attentive, filled our drinks.  Service as expected!  Great location.  Portion size for the Cheese steak was good size and had yummy fries and ranch.  The spinach salad was good but the portion size was less than stellar.  I would come again. Casual dining experience."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I don't review places on Yelp.  I have worked in sales and service all my adult life and if there's one thing I can't stand, it's a petty customer complaining about insignificant details, when in reality, there's someone usually working their tail off on the other end just to make your entitled selves feel special, and I just don't believe in bashing businesses, unless there's a significant reason to.  So, when I see people just knocking it out of the park in spite of the world we live in and majority of nasty customers they face day-in, day-out, I think it's really important to make sure they are recognized.  Britney and Vegas made my night at the Tilted Kilt in Robinson.  IF I WERE A RESTAURANT/BAR OWNER OPENING A NEW BUSINESS, THESE ARE TWO PEOPLE I'D HIRE ON DAY ONE AND BUILD AROUND.  These two behind the bar are rockstars and professionals.  In a world where nasty is normal, Britney and Vegas make you have hope in humanity again.    First of all, both of them were intensely focused on doing a great job.  I want to write letters to these people's parents thanking them for raising them right.  Work ethic off the charts.  I came in at nearly 10 on a Saturday night, and you'd have thought both just started their shift.    Secondly, personality-wise, you couldn't ask for two better.  Britney is perfect.  I could write a whole review on the reasons she alone kills it.  She had total command of the bar, no one reasonable was unhappy, and I'd argue every man at the bar was thrilled by her service and presence.  She's smart, hilarious, obviously cares about doing a good job, and is a legitimate heartbreaker.  Vegas is probably the most authentic young person I've encountered in recent memory, and breaks every millennial stereotype you can find in a list.  Young man has a solid future ahead of him.    I legitimately was so impressed by these two that I had to review this place.  I had actually never eaten here before and wouldn't have even come here if not for Scotch Eggs being on the menu and everybody else in Robinson having real basic menus, but if I knew these two were on duty and I lived in the area, this would become my go-to spot.  The Black & Bleu Burger was also one of the best I've ever had.  Even the fries were very, very good.    Everything was just better than expected, but in a time where most people are disappointing, these two people made a difference worth noting; I hope their ownership & management see in them what I did, and treat them accordingly.  As a customer?  Wouldn't have a second thought about coming here again...and I won't hesitate to.    Neither should you."}
{"text":"Just got finished eating here and I must give this location a 2 star rating. The food portions are small for the price, the food selection is slightly refined bar food, and the waitress didn't really service our table at all...when we were finished with our meal we finally got offered the 2nd beer..yeah no thanks.  I will never visit this Tilted Kilt ever again."}
{"text":"Ok let me get this right,  hot chick servers showing flat stomachs, legs and cleavage and this is not cool? Tilted Kilt gets horrendous reviews, but you've really got to appreciate it for the GUY'S hangout that it is.  This place has MORE TV's than any  other place in Downtown Cleveland which is good for watching a lot of Football, UFC, and or other sporting events. Other than that, the food was sub-par and the service was good. This isn't Fine dining at a French Cuisine...It's a SPORTS BAR with chicks showing cleavage. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"At this point probably one of my favorite sports bars in the areas.  I have tried a bunch all over the valley and this is the best place to go so far. Good food, good beer selection, and friendly staff. Fair prices too. I went for a NFL playoff game and the service did not dip like at other bars, in fact my waitress was around probably every 5-10 mins to check in on me which I've never seen before. The only knock on this place is that it's a little small but I have been here for many large sporting events like UFC fights, Mayweather fights, playoffs, college games and was always able to find a spot. Definitely recommend this location.  (Don't forget the 10% check in promotion on yelp.  I always forget.)"}
{"text":"The Tilted Kilt, at least the one in downtown Phoenix (the only one I have been to) is probably not what you would expect.  Yes, it is a relatively noisy sports bar.  Yes, the girls are attractive and wear tiny kilts.  But the food really is decent, the atmosphere is nice and, despite what some say, okay for family (I have seen lots of families with kids eating there on game days).  But, to be honest, none of that rates a five star review.  For me, the reason for five stars is the nice, hardworking, fun people who work at the restaurant.  They are Five-Star People.  This place is close to work and relatively fast and the staff does not mind helping me with my newspaper crossword puzzles at lunch.  Everyone at the restaurant, from the hostesses, the the servers, the bussers (yes, the bussers) and the management, is really friendly.  I have had all of them sit down and chat with me at one time or another.  My friend, Melissa H., would say I have been ensorceled by the young girls but the fact is they are friendly and full of energy.  Special props go to Michelle (Meesh), Sarah, Kim, Annie and Denielle and to their great manager, MJ.  This is not the place to go if you want to wow a client, woo a girlfriend or impress her parents.  If you just want decent, simple food in a fun atmosphere with fun people, this may be the place for you."}
{"text":"So, all that matters is this -- the babes serving the slop and booze were cute and sexy as it gets. The skirts and revealing low tops are the ultimate fetish. Way better than Hooters.   Having said that, I could see the same thing for free by sitting on Mill Av. Why are guys so desperate they will go to dumps like this just to see college aged girls bare some belly?   TV screens are all over the place but I doubt many male eyes are focused on sports when the babes are making the rounds.  THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE.  It's also overpriced.  Whatever you do don't order fried onion rings. Very gross! Most of the food is what you would expect if you went to grandma's retirement village -- except for the fact that her oatmeal would be better than anything TK serves.  I had to ask for napkins and silverware. Probably most guys that go to this voyeur palace don't use either so the babes don't bother putting them on the table.  If the baby dolls (waitresses) knew anything about the food they served it would help to avoid all the bad food. Expect them to give vacuous opinions about anything on the menu. The babes are very good at one thing -- when presenting the bill they bend down very low to display their firm bosoms. What better way to generate generous tips!  Actually if the babes were offered for dessert, I would give this place a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Many things I love about this place....top 2 are mozzie sticks and cougars!! Can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Staff was very accommodating.  Great service from Kelly and Scott the manager was very helpful.  Definitely a place to come with friendly people."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this location! The service was great and the food yummy as always. We have never had any problems here and would recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Not impressed. While I was here during Super Bowl, I was in town early enough before the crush, and the food an service were both really good.   However, fter a couple of days, even though they said they were prepared, it was painfully obvious they weren't. They service was atrocious, they food (what they hadn't run out of) was crappy and cold. And this was a full 12 days before the game! I went one more time before I had enough. While I understand that this was Super Bowl Week, I was shocked that they were so unprepared."}
{"text":"I went on St. Patricks day to the Tilted Kilt.  I enjoyed my visit.  It was the best cornbeef sandwich I had in a long time."}
{"text":"Wow. First time here. Hungry and the food was still bad. Only go for cold beer, big screen TVs and push up bras. There is nothing else here!"}
{"text":"Went to this location for lunch with a friend.  Food was good, not great.  Service was better.  But the place was dead.  Deader than GPS systems.  Deader than fax machines.  It's a beautiful restaurant with decent food and a zillion TV's with pretty girls waiting tables...how is it dead?  Prices were high, maybe that's the reason.    But people should definitely go to lunch here.  These girls need your help.  They barely have enough money to clothe themselves.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Rating would be higher if the place had air conditioning.  So hot and stuffy in here it's horrible.  We are locals and won't be back until this problem is fixed."}
{"text":"The only really awful thing about this place is that there isn't really anything that is considered \"irish\" here. It's just a facade to get you in. Our service was pretty excellent and while the girl was not exactly the brightest bulb, she was super sweet and really nice. I ordered the fish and chips and they were really delicious. My boyfriend had the wicked Boston burger with sweet potato fries and he thoroughly enjoyed it. I really appreciated the atmosphere as an escape from the strip and the laid back feel from the waitress. We would definitely come back,especially if they incorporate some more Irish food! Try adding Guinness stew or something!"}
{"text":"With the risk of pissing someone off or getting my ass kicked by a large Irish/Scottish gent, I must say, in America, KILTS ARE WEIRD ON MEN. Having said that, the ladies look ok with their pushed up and out boobies.  The food is average at Tilted Kilt. The Shepard's Pie looked as if someone vomited on my mashed potatoes. On the other hand, the wings are VERY good. Especially the grilled wings.  Tilted Kilt has a great selection of beer on tap.  The service was mostly pleasant. I'm guessing management encourages a fun work environment, but that creates a lot of staff conversations. As customers, we don't need our hand held or non stop attention, but customer awareness leads to quality service.  Tilted Kilt has many tv's. During the World Series, the game sound was audible 2 out of the 4 nights visited. Kind of a bummer not to hear sound for such a big sporting event. They played music during Monday Night Football.  As you can see, I'm back and forth...thus giving Tilted Kilt 3 stars."}
{"text":"MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT! One of the most frustrating and insulting experiences I've had in many years. Stay far away from this place because there are much better places to eat and drink nearby.  Everything started out normally. I came in alone thinking I would catch the happy hour on their \"$2 Tuesday.\" Business was a little slow so I was greeted and seated promptly and within 5 minutes I had spoken to two of the waitresses and placed my drink order. The young lady who took my order even commented that my selection was in line with their \"$2 Tuesday\" pricing event. I was also informed that the waitress who's section I was seated in was \"busy at the moment but would be right over.\"  This is where things started to go sideways. After 20 minutes I still had not been served. Finally, Anisha, my waitress came and introduced herself and informed me that my drink order had been submitted. (no choice of glass size was ever offered or requested - I'll get to this later)  Five minutes later my first drink arrived. Time passes and after finishing my first drink the glass sat on the table, empty, for a good 15 minutes as my server walked past several times before I was asked if I wanted another. This was to be a reoccurring theme during my stay. I ordered another drink and some food. Food quality and turn-around time was good but the wait time for drinks was still unacceptable.  I ordered one more drink and asked for my ticket to be closed out. Upon receiving my bill I noticed that I had been charged FULL PRICE for my drinks. When I brought this to my server's attention, I was informed that the $2 Tuesday price was for a \"regular\" size glass and that I was being served in the 20oz glass. Remember the \"no choice of size offered\" statement above?    I paid the tab but that little (intentional) omission of the size of the glass, was paid for with (what would have been) the young girl's tip.  I WILL NOT BE BACK and I strongly suggest you take your business elsewhere! There are plenty of other nearby establishments who treat their customers with more respect, honesty and provide more efficient customer service."}
{"text":"Went to Tilted Kilt while the Pirates were playing on the weekend. First time there and it was okay. Nothing special and the food was just alright. The service was fine but I would prefer Bettis Grille. Not that it wasn't to be expected but it was about 99% men."}
{"text":"Trying to capitalize on the Hooters gig, Tilted Kilt fails.  The waitstaff is OK. Having to prance around in those little outfits may please the male clientele but I don't know... maybe I'm getting old (or maybe it's because I have daughters that age) but it's kinda degrading... Our waitress had to be no more than 19....she still had braces. Looked at my receipt when I got home and she even charged us for too many beers.   Food was typical bar food. I had a burger and it was no better and no worse than any burger I've had in any sports bar in America. Nothing to write home about.   Lots of TVs. I even got to see my beloved Phillies on a screen right in front of me.  All in all, it's a gimmick. Stay away."}
{"text":"Let's See....  Horrible service from a skanky girl, serving food that belongs in a correctional facility.  This had to been one of the very worst dining (for lack of a better word) experiences I've ever had, anywhere.  Can't I post anything lower than one star??"}
{"text":"Their grilled wings are the best. Lots of beer selection."}
{"text":"Been here a few times food is always decent , services good but wait times can be long if it's a Friday or Saturday evening . Lots of beers to choose from ! Sweet potato fries and Shepard's pie is great !"}
{"text":"3 STARS FOR SURE - Across from US AIRWAYS CENTRE downtown. Park for $10 bucks in the lot across the street. You will need to take the outdoor escalator to the 2nd floor. Once inside you will find a slick sports bar with lots of visuals to keep you distracted for a few minutes or hours. The beer is good and so is the food. This place stays in business due to location, great marketing/advertising and the tight fitting and revealing outfits required of the hostesses. This is a guy's sports den, not for date night or an all girl's night out. Really, without the scantily clad servers, this place is a miss. You decide."}
{"text":"We went to have dinner here before going to the High Roller. I ordered the Irish beef stew which I really liked. It was flavorful and tender. The waitress did a good job being always attentive. My friends said their food were good. The music was loud although I prefer not being too loud but it's a pub after all. Overall, a nice experience for me."}
{"text":"Food was Pretty good, beer was cold but service was shitty at best."}
{"text":"Pluses:  Great looking servers and hostesses, very nice.  Our server Mary gave us great service.  Food and drinks were standard, nothing to write home about.  Minuses: Busy on a Saturday afternoon after the Spring Training game across the street ended.  I was surprised they could seat our party of 7 right away, but they did;  In a back room with pool tables and dart boards and us kind of squeezed in-between.  It didn't appear to be an area they normally put tables.  And soon, a group of biker-looking fellows showed up to play pool and seemed very put out that we were 'in their space'.  It made the whole situation uncomfortable, and even a little dangerous."}
{"text":"Super fast service but I rarely travel to Scottsdale AZ."}
{"text":"First the good; service was fast, efficient, and friendly, and they have a pretty decent beer selection on tap (not phenomenal, but decent).  Unfortunately, all the food I tried varied from the low end of mediocre to just bad.  Their pretzels and pub cheese appetizer was awful.  The \"cheese\" resembles that awful oil-based stuff you get in a convenience store and they tried to doctor it up with a bunch of bell peppers and similar things to make it more than just fake cheese.  It doesn't work.  It's just inedible.  The pretzels themselves were good.  The waitress brought us their \"nacho\" cheese which is the same stuff with different spices added; still bad.  I ordered the grilled hot wings for my dinner.  They were the most rubbery wings I've ever had.  I can only guess that they heat these in a microwave instead of frying them.  They grilled them for a few seconds and sent them out.  The sauce was ok, not hot, but the rubbery texture was too distracting.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"All I have to say on this one is... AMAZING GARLIC FRIES!!!  If you want a relaxing atmosphere for a few drinks, a large patio to get some fresh air, maybe a game of pool and some good food, then this is a pretty decent place!  It's a good size bar, so I wasn't smushed against other people."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Tilted Kilt. The atmosphere can be a bit distasteful for some due to the uniform but if you can turn a blind eye to that, the food can be very enjoyable. I say that with the preconceived notion that your expecting bar food when you walk into this establishment.  Lets be honest with what the concept behind Tilted Kilt is, A sports bar for men that 1UPs hooters.  I absolutely can't stand hooters food and regular bar food can be a bit dingy or greasy in most cases. Tilted Kilt offers a much broader menu than most with salads, sandwiches, full entrees, you name it. As lame as it sounds, my go to is the Chicken Tender basket with no sauce, it comes with Cheyenne Ranch and the chicken is lightly breaded. It has the right about of spicy for me at lunch and doesn't over stuff me when I need to get back to work.   Other suggestions would be the drunken clams appetizer or the Fish Tacos, they hit the spot too.   Yes, some servers can be hit or miss, but feel like that happens any where you go these days.  I take it with a grain a salt I guess. But my overall response and feedback on this place is that they are an excellent sports bar that beats out Hooters, I don't think they are trying to be anything else than that."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the people who gave this place a low rating obviously didn't try the food!  I've been here twice now and have absolutely loved the food both times.  I decided to give this place a try because my sister raved about the burgers.  Let me tell you, the place did not disappoint!  The burgers were handmade and cooked to perfection.  This place has an array of yummy fried things like beer battered onion rings, homemade chips, and nachos that will make you wish you had more room in your stomach.  The beer selection is also really good.  In general all of the ingredients seem to be fairly high quality.  With all of that said, some dolt of a marketing person decided that the waitresses should be dressed in skimpy outfits.  They wear only slightly more cloths than Hooter's Girls.  The BIG difference is that Hooter's food can't stand on its own.  They need another attraction to keep the doors open.  This place has excellent food.  If you are looking for an outstanding burger, be a grown-up, ignore the gals if you like, and eat here.  You won't regret it.  I'd probably leave the kids at home..."}
{"text":"Decent and fun party zone before Dbax games, it can be packed on weekends. Babes look great, service is ok, and food is mediocre, but none of that really matters. Come for the babes before the game."}
{"text":"Good cold brews, hot wings, cheese sticks all the good bar food you have come to love. Plus the girls were nice and very friendly.  Took some friends and everyone had a blast watching the games on many super XX large TV's."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the concept of an Irish Hooters, so I went.  The good: A) Their garlic fries (or whatever they're called) are tasty.   B) Admittedly, the trashy outfits are kind of cute.  The bad and ugly: A) Mixed drinks seemed to be watered down. B) The girls (\"entertainers,\" as they're called) looked young enough to still be in high school, which was just gross. C) Our waitress seemed awfully pissed off about our being there, spending money.  We had a friend join us midway through our dinner & drinks.  She appeared 30 seconds after he arrived (and hadn't been able to look through the menu yet).  He told her that he needed a minute to decide.  She disappeared for at least 20 minutes and we had to flag down another waitress to go get her.  She came back and said, \"What do you want?\"  ....Classy.  Not really worth it, unless you want an outfit change from Hooters-orange."}
{"text":"We had dinner and drinks for the World Series and really enjoyed Twisted Kilt. A nice combo of food and drink choices. Everyone couldn't have been nicer. Our server, Casey, did a great job. Very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great happening atmosphere!   Ordered the black and Bleu cooked medium, but it was still dry. I wonder how it would be if I had ordered well done?!  The tilted Buffalo flathead was pretty good. I especially liked the celery bits that were in it.   All in all, it was an average experience. I have no reason to run back here."}
{"text":"I went to the Tilted Kilt tonight as an impromptu restaurant stop while I happened to be in Robinson.  The service wasn't too bad; my friend and I had Kytera as our waitress. She was pretty attentive to us (we sat at the bar).  We ordered the pretzels as our appetizer, and they were really good- they had just a little kick in them. I didn't have an entree, but my friend had the Shepherd's pie. It looked like dog food to me, but he said it was pretty good. I think it could have at least used a garnish; a dollop of sour cream, some parsley maybe.   I had the brownie for dessert, and it was really good, too; the brownies were hard on the outside; gooey on the inside. Perfect. But, for the same price, Applebee's gives you double the serving and their presentation is far better.  I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant; it was colorful and tasteful, and there was some really good music playing.  If I was back in the Robinson area, I'd go back to Tilted Kilt but it really wasn't anything exciting. I live in Cranberry Township; I certainly wouldn't make a special trip to Robinson for Tilted Kilt."}
{"text":"Only stopped in because the had $7 Moscow Mules which were ok but not the best I've had. Nice place, sports bar with lots of TV's and comfy seating."}
{"text":"Limited beer selection especially what is on tap. pretty good burgers. Typical sports bar."}
{"text":"My server Berkeley was absolutely amazing and entertaining. Made my night, wish there were more servers like her. The Mac N Cheese was good too."}
{"text":"This place is a sports fans dream.  Tvs everywhere, tons of beer on tap and the food is decent.  Stopped in after a Monsters game and sat at the bar and were instantly served.  Ordered some boneless wings and a flatbread pizza and the food was pretty good. The people on this site trying to degrade the girls that work here should just stop.  You know what the tilted kilt is about and the two that waited on us were nice, and attractive.  Nothing wrong with that.  It's a sports bar, and this place has everything you could possibly want."}
{"text":"its a chain bar with girls in kilts. food is ok. beer selection is pretty large but still not too impressive. bartender didnt know how to make drinks that were on their menu, so not too impressed on that front either. as a vegetarian there isnt too much to choose from on this menu, but there arent tons of veg friendly spots around here. enjoy the view and hope for the best."}
{"text":"It seemed an unlikely place to start a bachelorette party, but it worked.    The kilt girls were very complimentary of my friend, the bride, and took good care of us.  We had a huge party and ate well.  Our servers never seemed flustered and were pleasant, even when part of our party arrived late.    I am a sucker for Irish stew, so I enjoyed a hearty bowl for my meal (the beef was not quality, but the flavor was good). The bride had a delicious flatbread pizza, and we shared appetizers and wraps and burgers among us.    It's a loud sports bar with flat screen TVs, college kids, liquor, and cleavage - a fun energy if you're not there to be romantic."}
{"text":"Bar food. Nothing spectacular, although I already kinda knew that. Good happy hour for beer."}
{"text":"I had no idea that this place was a large national chain because, surprisingly, it has more of a 'local-bar' feel, complete with all the tools and townies in here who think that they will hook up with a waitress because he ordered a Hoegaarden instead of a Miller Lite.    Its a totally cheesy bar, but its not bad as a gamewatching spot for a game that you aren't completely invested in, maybe catching a beer, some chicken tenders, and a couple of quarters of the game before moving on to Home Depot across the street or something.    Writing this review, I'm actually surprised upon recollection how many times I had been here.  We used to come for Suns playoff games, which was virtually impossible for seating purposes (at this point they start having table-waits) and parking.  The atmosphere was better than your average Valley sports bar however.  People seem to really care about sports here, though I wouldn't really classify it as a 'sports bar', rather a neighborhood type bar with screens.  I also used to come here for poker nights, which I doubt they still do as too many 'bags came to drink iced tea and wouldn't tip the waitresses.  Maybe someone can inform if they still do.  Then, we used to come after soccer rec league games, which was kind of a dweeby thing to do in our footy kits, but whatever.  It was a few years ago, anyway.  Still, this is the type of place that gets people right from their beer guzzler rec leagues and into the bar still in their Mark Mitsubishi (Mark Mitsubishi) sponsored baseball tees.  This is the primary reason why you won't want to stick your hands into the huge barrels of Gardetto's mix, despite the unreal temptation for a dabble.    Overall, i suppose I can't really hate on this place too much.  Its kind of weak, but it is a decent option, particularly in the 'Took, where there just ain't many other options.  Just don't be one of the wanks who tries to pick up a waitress for the love of God."}
{"text":"Came here for 'happy hour'. $5 domestic drafts. Ask for 2 bud lights. When our bill comes out, beers are $8 each, for bud light. Bartender says we didn't order the correct size. Why would you go for happy hour and get the beer that's not on happy hour?   Sliders were $4, on the menu they look big, and delish. Ordered 2 sliders and the happy hour wings for $7. Get the food 20 mins later, sliders are literally the size of White Castle burgers, 2 mouthfuls, for $4. We also got 5 small wings, for $7. The wings were quite nice but still won't be going back. Absolute rip off"}
{"text":"My daughter called and told me to meet her and her husband at the Tilted Kilt on a Wednesday night, I didn't even question her as to why, just said ok I'll be their!   Secretly I have been wanting to try Tilted Kilt for a while, so meet up with my friend, daughter and her hubby and found out its trivia night, omg how much fun is that??   Found out that happy hour is from 5pm to 7pm and I have to say they have a good selection of drinks & food on that happy hour menu, I went for 2 long island ice teas and some mozzarella sticks. Also ordered some potato skins with horseradish dipping sauce, omg I love love love horseradish sauce and potatoes so it was a win win for me on this dish!  Also I have been suffering from an extreme sweet tooth, that sometimes only brownies can satisfy, so I ordered the brownie guilt and asked for extra caramel sauces, and yes that did the trick, cured my sweet tooth for sure!   Have to say  it was a fun night, our team placed 7th out of 12 for trivia night (don't judge us haha ) look forward to going back to Tilted Kilt to try some more pub grub, booze and play trivia!"}
{"text":"They were pretty busy. The menu has changed and they no longer have flatbread pizza which was a bummer for my vegatarian daughter. But they do have black bean patties so she settled for that. Burgers were good. It was kind of nice to sit in the back room game room away from the madness of the soccer game on tv. Another downfall is they charge extra for ranch. We will back next. Servers looking cute as always. And yes we are both females that went. We go for the food not the chicks. Are we are not gay."}
{"text":"Got the chicken tacos and loved them! My husband got the pulled pork sandwich. Wait staff members were really great!"}
{"text":"After our flight back to Pittsburgh we stopped in to eat at the Tilted Kilt. There was only a few people around the bar area since it was just after noon. We were seated and the waitress Tom our order. She was very friendly and sat a talked with us for a bit. We ordered burgers for lunch and there were cooked perfectly. There were several TV's to view while eating and the rest of the staff was very friendly also. Great meal at a great place to eat."}
{"text":"good food and prices, fun atmosphere.  sassy waitresses.  a good lunch joint or for happy hour."}
{"text":"Analese was a fantastic server. She was very attentive and super sweet. This was my first time to this location. It is way big. I felt like I had some privacy while eating and visiting. There are plenty of tv's to enjoy any type of sports games. The managers are always walking the restaurant checking in on their customers. I had the fish and chips which was very good. You get 3 big pieces plus the fish is very tender.  Their fried pickles are delicious as well. I'm a sucker for fried pickles.   I had a great time here and appreciated having a wonderful server.   Plus they have a Yelp checkin offer."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports events. Service however takes ages but thankfully we had the 3 hours to spare in a bit busy place"}
{"text":"I went there when it was first opened and really was unimpressed.  I actually felt sorry for the women who are dressed rather scantily and service and food was terrible.  Now it has been a couple years and a Groupon got me in the door in November.  It has kept me coming back.  I have continued going there because the tv's at he bar are the best around.  They have great happy hour specials and the food is pretty good.  And those scantily clad bar tenders are really nice young ladies."}
{"text":"OK. I don't review n bars usually but we had an amazing time here.  First ask for Annie. She was an amazing wit and drained us of all our cash while maintaining to make us laugh and easily the hottest one here. She is also very knowledgeable about the local action.  Beer and shots were tasty and fast and a great locals feel for a chain facility.  Great employees make a great experience. Corporate America needs to remember this."}
{"text":"Terrible service, during our meal a huge dust thing fell from the ceiling and the manager was like were you done with that!  No I'm sorry or what can I do to help make your meal better?  We had to go get our own silverware and napkins!!!!..... We also had to clear our table because the server thought this was a strip club not a place for food and drinks she spent more time talking with other tables then doing her job. I would NOT recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I am sorry but I have to deduct one star from my previous review.    Service here is always just ok, that's fine.  What made me disappointed was the corn chips and salsa.  It was a $5 snack.  I wanted to add guacamole for an additional $5.  I was fine with it and thought that at least I would get a freshly made one.  Unfortunately, the one came with the chips was only a tiny bowl of color-turned avocado with whatever stuff should be made with for guacamole.  I didn't know why I still finished most of it (hungry maybe?).  The good news is I am fine and no diarrhea or anything lol.  The chips were definitely not homemade.  The salsa was the worst I ever had.    This place cannot even make this simple bar snack a little better??"}
{"text":"I would say the two and a half star ranking on this place is about accurate. I would put this under the heading of restaurants \"no one goes to for food\". I have been there a couple of times for lunch with my work crew and I can also say this isn't a place you should go for lunch. It's very much just ok and being downtown you have a thousand other places to choose from. There are some pretty ladies here so if that's your motivation I'd say stop in for a beer after work or after dinner somewhere else. I am sure I'll be here again."}
{"text":"Probably the best Tilted Kilt I have been to. Our service was great and the food was solid as well."}
{"text":"Only come here to watch the Redskins game as it's known to be a Redskins bar, duh! Lol service is super great,  we had appetizers and it's good."}
{"text":"The chicks here are smoking hot!!! Like i'm not even kidding. There are some dime pieces up in here.The food is good and the bar service is really good.Yes the food is expensive and yes the drinks are expensive. I don't wanna hear any complaints if you're a person that goes to Vegas night clubs. You guys pay 20$ for a bottle of water in a night club and you call Tilted Kilt expensive??? Lol laughable!!! There is a drink called the purple haze which is bomb. Taste like grap kool aid and it has you feeling good. I came here ladt summer for the Weidman vs Machida fight and was here in January for the Jones vs Cormier fight. This is a great place to watch UFC fights. The girls are trained to handle the crazy crowds during ufc fights. Like my food didn't take long at all!!! I was shocked.    My one complaint about Tiltes kilt is that they some times have the guys take drink orders................ It doesn't bother me that much tbh but prettt sure it bothers 90% of your male customers. It's cool when a guy ask you if you want water and stuff but we would rather take our drink orders from a hot chick. That's the main reason were here lol. Twin peaks doesn't do this  the guys only really ask if you want water or if you're done with your plate so they can put it away. I'm the dunke of Tilted Kilt currently so Kilt...you might wann listen. I'll be back next month"}
{"text":"First walking in i was expecting some super hot girls  be in these tiny lil outfits. No i saw a bunch of avg to not so great looking girls with tiny outfits! There was probably 1 maybe 2 girls i saw that looked decent enough to be wearing the outfit where you can't help but stare because her body is amazing! I had come with my bf his twin and 2 of their friends.  Thankfully we got a girl who had a nice body but not so great of a face so it worked out okay. As long as they aren't shaking their tits in my bfs face its  all good. But of course my luck failed me somewhat  because a girl definitely that should not be wearing the outfit with her stomach hanging over her skirt shook my bfs mixed drink in a little jar called \"the big red\" in his face claiming by our waitress that the girl by my bf is a better \"shaker\" (obviously with EVERYTHING jiggling) and my bf's friend couldn't help but laugh since he was sitting across from me watching my face as she shook her tits in MY bf's face totally reading my expression out loud after she left the table. Its one thing if i don't come with, but when i am with him don't try no funny business in front of me. I am not insecure people I just do not feel comfortable watching my boyfriend oogle some ugly ass(literally) broad shake her tits 2 inches from his face. Territorial and Jealousy are two different things.   ANYHOW....  FOOD: AWESOME chicken sandwich with the pesto mayo is to die for. cole slaw is okay french fries are stellar and so is the garlic fries apparently.  It is a little pricey but it was a first and last thing for me. I wasn't so thrilled with the place i want to go back for the food and tits in my face thing again as a customer.   Our waitress always came by and even sat at our table sometimes. which i thought was weird but shes 19 so you know...19 your dumb at that age in a way. You may be book smart but nobody invited her to sit at our table like she was our long lost best friend. Excuse me but go back to work we are having a discussion and have to stop our discussion now to make a new one because you have nothing better to do at work obviously (even though you are in a tiny outfit and could be building on your tips at other tables but making me want to give you less).  So thinking about all this that has happened i am only giving them half a star for the food and half a star for the fact the waitress always asked if we needed anything else. But to cut into our discussions i found to be extremely unprofessional and rude in a way. So after that i really can't say that i would want to return to any Tilted Kilt to be quite honest with you unless i was offered a job there. HONESTLY..."}
{"text":"Horrible! We ordered to go on st pattys day. Ordered a burger plain and the corned beef and cabbage dinner and buffalo wings. We drove 15 min o pick it up. Came home and they forgot the corned beef dinner. The burger was not plain. And the wings were dry. No buffalo sauce    I decided to try a nibble since I had no dinner and the wings were so disgusting. Tasted bad. Like bad meat. They smelled nasty too. We wound up on throwing everything away. In the trash. Didn't eat any of it. This place was busy that night but it's really no excuse for such terrible food. The entire place seems to be run by 20 year olds.  Not a real adult in the joint. This place used to be good. What happened?"}
{"text":"We went during happy hour, needless say, service was awful. Servers and the two managers were playing on their phones. My wife's mushroom swiss burger was OK, the mushrooms and red onions were still raw.  When leaving the hostess was too busy on her phone to say bye to us! Really, I had great expectations after seeing this chain on undercover boss. He's needs go undercover here!"}
{"text":"nice place good ambience.. friendly staff.. recommended for friends... hope to hang out soon again"}
{"text":"Not as good as local pubs, food is pretty bad, and they got our drink menu mixed up last time.. asked for a Stella.. got a Guinness. Friend asked for hot tea, got ice tea.  They really need to work on their food quality. They leave a lot to ask for."}
{"text":"Came here for a UFC Fight Night. $5 cover.   Wings and fries were delicious and drinks were really good. They have a solid collection of Scotch (Macallan 12 and Glenfiddich 18 to name a few), tons of beer, and great bartending. Food came out very fast and fresh.   For sport fans, this is a great pub. There are like 30 TV's dispersed all around indoors and outdoors, including a TV in the men's bathroom."}
{"text":"Poor service. Sat at the bar for nearly 5 min & never was acknowledged by bar staff. It's only 315pm, not busy. Guess too busy to take a customer's money.   On the way out I told the hostess, cared even less then them.  Don't go!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite to eat before our show at Talking Stick Arena. Started off with their special St. Paddy's Day Reuben Tator Tots. They were awesome! The tots were crunchy and loaded with cheese, sauerkraut, bits of corned beef, and topped with green onions. Totally the bomb! Then hubby and I decided to split the Boston Burger. It was delish - cooked perfectly with crispy bacon and an onion relish that totally made the burger rock. Our server was great! Very attentive and super friendly and nice. Will totally return another day!"}
{"text":"went in with a group of 17 we had nonstop serves  ice cold beer every time the ufc fights are always on awesome staff good music good for big groups  we left a good tip  they Used to be great,but then it has really gone down hill, with very variable food, and long long waits to even be acknowledged, even on quiet weekdays.  was on the verge of not going back  have gone 2 times both service like before  not sure what changes u made  but i love it"}
{"text":"Regular patron of this location but after tonight that will be the last time I will grace the doorstep. My wife and daughter and future son-in-law had been out of town and told them to meet me for dinner at 8:00 pm. We walked in and was told that there would be a $5 cover per person to eat dinner because of a UFC fight. I asked again if that was for dining people or the bar?  The young lady in a very rude tone you either pay or leave. What a great way to run a restaurant. So on that note I'm done with the tilted kilt. The guys I ride bikes with each week will be going to a new place this same young lady was rude to us the last week. Sorry but this was a cool place for the area but I don't need to be treated like that ever."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch menu, great prices. Very friendly staff. Go up escalator to get here."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday with a few friends for a drink. Place was busy. Waitress as sexy dresses. Other than that just a regular pub."}
{"text":"I had dinner here when I was in town last week, and while the food wasn't bad, there was certainly room for improvement.  I sat at the bar, which wasn't too crowded at 6 p.m. on a Sunday. The bartenders were very nice, and service there came pretty quickly. I had a Tennessee Arnold Palmer, which wasn't a bad cocktail (the drink was stiff, but so was the $12 pricetag!).  However, the kitchen was very slow in making food, and not to just me. It took about 40 minutes for my burger, and while it wasn't bad, others at the bar also remarked about the slow rate at which entrees left the kitchen.  It's not a bad bar and grill, and it'll do well in its current location. I'm not opposed to giving it another shot; hopefully the kitchen is a little quicker getting food out next time."}
{"text":"Cool place, good food, cold drinks and a great atmosphere. Even though I'm gay the servers were pretty attractive.   It's a straight man's paradise. Good looking servers wearing next to nothing just about every game you could want to see. What more do you need.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As the Duke of the Tilted Kilt I must tell you it is a breath of fresh air for the downtown lunch scene.  Does it hurt that the girls a beautiful, not at all, but the food is what makes me keep coming back. I've tried many of the menu items and everything has been tasty and delicious! I'm assuming the low rating are from the ultra conservative dinners, but as a person with an open mind let me tell you it is one of the best bets for lunch downtown."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and watch the UFC fights. There is a $5 cover, but that thins the crowd of the cheap people, which is great. The food is great, friendly servers ( kind of ) and once again, great place to watch UFC. If you are an MMA fan, come here so you can watch. Not a lot of people and really fun!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Definitely come here again. The servers are really friendly, and the Irish theme is pretty cool."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to get pub grub and watch a game. Great place!! The food was decent and the price couldn't have been better on the strip. Burger was only $11. Any other place in Vegas is like $16. We went there 3 times when we were there because it had great prices. The steak and cheese sub, burger, and quesedilla were awesome, buffalo dip not so much, I'm not the biggest fan of blue cheese and it was really watery. That's all!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We sat outside and it was 4p so not busy but we had to go inside to get our waitress --twice!  It's a Scottish Hooters. It also smells like a bar when you enter. Keep walking."}
{"text":"This is one of the good sports bars available in downtown Phoenix. Good beer selection, a lot of screens for sports, and the food is better than other sports bars.  I was staying downtown & looking for a place to eat, watch football, & have beer. Tilted Kilt is a franchise, but the restaurant in Phoenix provides better quality food (fresh, not pickled jalapeños on my nachos) and better service (I'm an old guy & not attractive to the help) than others that I visit around the country.  I'll be back..."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant it was fine. As most know, the girls wear close to nothing. The girls this night were thin so it didn't bother us. We just came in for a few drinks. It wasn't busy by any means, but the drinks weren't too speedy to make it to the table. No big deal since we weren't in a hurry."}
{"text":"I'm yelping it!! Paige and Kali are amazing!!! They both got us buzzing & served some amazing wings-- Philippe did some killer magic tricks and always has my boyfriend and I returning. See ya and the real magician Thursday!! Step up your coaster game ladies"}
{"text":"This place has great food and plenty of TVs for watching whatever sports event you want! Their chips and salsa with beer cheese is a great snack for a lazy afternoon and they have a variety of beers that compliment any of their dishes.  Service has always been great, but they get super busy during the weekends so getting a refill can be a bit of a chore. Even so, the atmosphere is certainly enjoyable. In the cooler months, the restaurant has large windows they open up to the outside passersby so it feels like you're outside, chilling."}

{"text":"Came here after a night out at the strip looking for a place to eat. First time trying tilted kilt and was not satisfied with how the food tasted. Especially for the price we payed for it. I know I'm not going back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place even gets two stars is because a really nice waitress took over our service. We were seated waited for 10 minutes before anyone came to even acknowledge us. After that they brought us out waters but didn't bring our actual drink orders for another 20 minutes, or came to take our order. Meanwhile other parties were seated and served right away. Anyway, the service was absolutely awful. Make sure to bring a guy next time you stop by."}
{"text":"Tilted kilt is a nice bar it's very good to come here watch a game a chill it seems like guys bar as probably most guys come for the uniform the servers wear. The food like fries and nachos they are good but I would not suggest you come here for the food as I tried the tacos and we're not so good. This kind of bars are not famous for the food so I will suggest you try another place if your looking for food. Beer and watch TV is what this bar offer. They also have a video game where you can play poker and another game similar to curling."}
{"text":"We stopped here before the Leaf game on Oct 31. We had the Irish dip sandwich ( so good ) and the traditional wings ( just as good ) The food came quickly and it was nice and hot when it arrived. Our beer was ice cold from the tap. Our waitress was very friendly and efficient. Overall we thought this was a fantastic bar!! We will come back and we will tell our friends about this place."}
{"text":"I used to think this was a decent place and my friends and I would stop in after playing golf.  Decent beers and food with attractive women, what's not to like? The last time I was there, we are a full meal, had a couple of beers each and were contemplating ordering another.  The idiot fro the door came up to us and said there was a pay fight on TV and we would have to pay a cover or leave.  As if our plan was to come in a hour or more early and spend over $50 to save a cover fee on a fight we were not staying for.  This is bad business! We have not been back and will not return."}
{"text":"The worst dining experience ever! It took the waitress 15 minutes to approach us for drinks. Then an hour waiting for food. We were told a cook walked out and that is why our food long. Then they told us they ran out of wings but the order still came out afterwards. 1 out of 3 orders was missing and never came out. My 2 friends got their food and I still never got my order even when they had finished their food. I sat there like a hungry kid waiting for my food. When they had finally figured it out, i just asked for it to be boxed. As we left, I didn't check the order until we got in the car and it was the wrong order! It was pretty ridiculous..."}
{"text":"I really liked this location.  Great view of downtown on the patio, it is located in a great spot, the food is great, the service is really good & most importantly, they have a good selection of beer.  I recommend the Blacksmith (Guiness & Smithwicks)."}
{"text":"The usual pub food and it was okay. Decent prices and good drink specials. The wait after ordering was a little long, but it looked like they had some new staff so it could be due to training. I would go back though."}
{"text":"A good sport bar to watch sports and hangout with friendly staff and plenty of TVs. I went there in a Monday afternoon which was slow but happy hour prices are very good. Kilt Lifter beer for $2, and calamari, steak bytes which I tried and liked where $5 each. Not a big fan of their shrimp dish though."}
{"text":"Ack! Bad service and skanky, ditzy girls already get a 3 star deduction from me. The food isn't bad though, and they have many beers on tap. I wouldn't come here again though due to the service and the rowdy, sleazy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I go here every Saturday to watch 12 hours of college football, and its always a great time. The food is actually really really good. I usually get the Caesar Wrap, Kilt Burner Wings, Longshank's Platter, or the Drunken Clams.   NOTE: It's an Oklahoma bar during college football season, so be prepared if you're rooting for another top team."}
{"text":"We were expecting to see beautiful ladies but instead we discovered dudes, in kilts. Luckily, Jean, the sole female behind the bar, made our visit somewhat enjoyable. These 2 stars are for her. Taking away 3 stars due to the men in kilts, nothing personal guys."}
{"text":"What did you say? Huh? Ok? Hey are you listening to me? Speak up Homeboy!!!  10.14.16 was a busy Friday night at Tilted Kilt, music blasting and tons of tourists, middle/older aged adults and how could we forget about the Millennials scattered around. It was one of those nights when a group of friends & co-workers all working in the hospitality industry need to unwind, chill and grab a bite. Our group had a great time here. The food wasn't mind blowing or super inventive but Irish-American style comfort food with alcoholic drinks.  Overall we had great time and the service was good. Great place to hangout with a group of friends if you don't mind the loud music. Plus they have alot of TV's all over this place with different sports and newsfeed. Check out the Dart board, Shuffleboard, Foosball Table and Bean Bag Toss."}
{"text":"First time coming to the place and our server Brea couldn't have been nicer. I wasn't familiar with the menu so I asked her for some suggestions.   The happy hour here seemed pretty cheap. The food was exceptional. I would definitely come back.   We went from the dining room out to the patio considering how nice of a day it was outside.   Overall satisfaction with our visit. Great place to eat and pretty cool environment. I would recommend anyone to come and visit this downtown grill and pub."}
{"text":"Very Hooters-ish, way too loud, and the wings are tiny. Servers are very nice, and the manager checks every table to make sure everyone's doing well. The service is pretty fast too. If you're not bothered (or distracted) by the servers' outfits, it's a chill place. Way too loud though, so keep that in mind.   P.S. It's across the street from an elementary school! Lol."}
{"text":"Wow.  I expected so much more out of this place.  I've been to their competitors, you know the one with the two peaks, and their food and customer service is great compared to this place.  I ordered the queso dip, which was not cheesy at all.  It was so chunky it was almost disgusting to eat.  I then had the pub pretzels which were actually delicious but the cheese sauce and the mustard sauce overpowered the pretzel and had such a packaged flavor that I ate the pretzels plain.  The food was some of the worst food I've ever had on the strip.    You can come here to look at girls dressed slutty and have a good time, but don't expect to come here for a good meal.  It's a shame because if they actually invested in having a well executed menu they could do really well with their location.  The only reason I giving it 2 stars and not 1 is because the pretzel was actually good alone."}
{"text":"Even on a very slow day the service is subpar at best. None of the staff were the least bit interested in waiting on us or even checking back with us once our food was delivered. We also had to get up and take our check to find someone who was even interested in us paying. They changed their menu and for the price you sure don't get much"}
{"text":"Attended an industry event here recently after a conference. This is one of the highlights of downtown Phoenix.  It's located on the 2nd floor of the building across from US Airways Arena.  It's much smaller than I expected, but it handled the 100+ people at the event well.  The servers are friendly and attentive.  The food was so/so.  The event hosts had self-serve Nachos, Flatbread, and Wraps.  It was above average for an event like this.  I want to come back and try something from the real menu.  There's a small patio that overlooks 1st St and Jefferson.  Too bad there's not much of a regular nightlife scene in downtown Phoenix, otherwise this could be a hot spot.  This is definitely on my list of pre-party joints before a Suns game.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"A few colleagues wanted to meet up for drinks and it was my turn to meet them on their side of town, so I drove all the way out to this location to have drinks & dinner.  It was around 6:30 pm on a Wednesday and it was pretty busy.  We were able to find a table and settled in.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger & Fries and washed it down with a pint of Smithwick's.  I've never had Smithwick's before, so I was anxious to give it a try.  It wasn't bad....a little lighter than I expected, but not bad.  The Burger came out after a short wait and I devoured it in short order.  It was pretty good and the portion is large...filled me up nicely.  After dinner, we hung out and watched a little baseball.  It was trivia night and it was kind of hard to follow the game with all of the trivia announcements.  Our waitress was nice and friendly and kept our glasses full.  Overall, a good night out.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch Preakness and get a bite for lunch. Sat promptly at a high top. 10 percent full. Waitress very friendly and prompt with taking our order and making suggestions. I had a kale salad with salmon. Dressing was delicious and had a kick to it. The others had their famous fish and chips and fish tacos.  Big portions. They couldn't finish theirs.  Food took a long time to come out. Good place to watch sports. Tons of tv. Good music, a little loud for me."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on the patio one day with some associates and it was ok.. Although, I'm sure this place is not renowned for their food..  - Southwest Spicy Chicken wrap wasn't actually spicy..  - No beer list so relied on the server to run it off her head and was like \"so we have 30 beers, what do you want\"... Well, how about something dark.. ok, like Rickards? ew. no.  How about something else.. Well, Sam Adams? (I'm going from memory here, I think she mentioned that).. and no.. I think we have Newcastle.. perfect! bring it.. she goes and brings the other orders and comes back with no Newcastle.. ok, we're out.. what do you want now.. really? wtf.. just give me a list instead of picking something random... Ended up with a wheat beer that someone else was drinking.. whatev..  - Garlic fries were recommended and sounded good by the server's description [slathered with garlic butter and parm] but actually, fries with a bit of parmesan cheese sprinkled on top doesn't really cut it.. so, meh."}
{"text":"Great food. Server was great. Problem with bill. Manager not helpful at all. Had Groupon didnt notice it was for 4 people. Was just me and my girl. Ya got me! He offered cash value or vouchers but not full value. Came for the deal. Really enjoyed the meal. Not the bitter after taste he left behind tho."}
{"text":"Okay place to hangout, grab a drink and watch a game. The service is always hit or miss. Food is definitely always a miss, but I mean it is bar food. On this particular night I ordered the Pub Fried Egg Burger; the bacon was burnt and the egg was so fried our table decided to use it as a frisbee.  If you are into scantily clad women that occasionally give good service, TK is definitely worth a try. It is just another average sports bar."}
{"text":"The food isn't very good and is more expensive then before because the quantities are smaller. The food needs some work. The waitress are not as good as before in service exceptions is Cece and Erica"}
{"text":"Great food!  Fun Environment! Hot Waitresses!   What more can I ask!    Can't go wrong with a burger.   Little pricey at times but you are in the location which calls for it.   The waitresses are all awesome!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night during peak hours--soon after they opened.  Needless to say, they were BUSY.  As a result, I've tried to give them some leeway in the service department.  We waited 15 min for a table (not bad when you consider there wasn't a parking place to be had).  We sat down and were greeted promptly by our cute, but less-than-experienced waitress.  It quickly became apparent that she had never waited tables in her life.  She wasn't familiar with the menu and had to keep referring back to it.  I ordered a cocktail (\"TK's Old Fashioned\") and was asked if I wanted it in a 20oz size (she thought I was ordering a beer).  I politely informed her that 20 oz of whiskey was a bit much if I was going to drive home--let alone remain conscious--for the rest of the evening.  The food was delicious (I had the Fish 'n Chips).  Pretty much what I'd expect for upper-end bar food.  The menu consists mostly of sandwiches, burgers... the usual American fast food cuisine.  The draft selection is pretty decent as well.  Unfortunately, we had to wait a little while for our food and drinks.  In the meantime, different servers kept walking by offering us other people's food.  It seemed to be very disorganized.  But like I said, they were VERY busy.  Now let's be honest, the real draw for this place is the ridiculously skimpy outfits worn by the almost all-female staff.   These girls make Hooters look like a convent!  It would make a great lunch destination for when the guys go out at work.  If this location can work out their service issues and give their waitresses some better training, they'd be 4-star material in my book."}
{"text":"Food's good, drink menu is good, service is pretty slow but waitresses are extremely hot....  The last time I came here I asked the waitresses what IPA's they have on tap, and she said that they have Guiness...at least she was really pretty."}
{"text":"My first visit was more than pleasant.  The girls were full of smiles and outgoing attitudes. I was excited just to be here. The food was way better then expected.  Not your average pub style food. The portion sizes were more than enough. Obviously the girls and there uniforms were an added bonus. This is my new after work and weekend place to hang out. They have big screen TV's everywhere with just about any sport you can think of. I look forward to bringing my friends because they are tired of me talking about it."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Sat outside on a nice evening, but didn't realize smoking was allowed.  We ordered a 1/2 rack of ribs and a Blue burger. Ribs were overdone and lacked tenderness. Burger was average. Fries were not great either. Add one Guinness and one Diet Coke and bill was $38. We won't return."}
{"text":"KEEP WALIKING PAST!  After being told that we needed to get it another chance with some in are party saying it was good.  I will now walk pass this location... Why?. Service was so poor aftee being seated it took 15 mintues to get just a girl to come to the table.  We then waites 10 for water to come to the table.  As we were just about to leave ahe returned and no one wanted to wait for a full meal we ordered a few apps.  They came out in about 10  mins.  The problem was the server nevere returned to get a drink order whixh all 6 of us were fine ai1nce at point we wanted to leave.  Left and went to the Yard House down the pathway where we were quickly seated and deinks with"}
{"text":"Love this place! Menu has great choices and food is wonderful. Staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Moron waitresses. Six of us walked in for beers today. The stoned waitress was too busy taking selfies on her stupid goddamned phone to serve us. I had to get up to go get her. She said she'd be right over. Too late. We left. Does this place even HAVE a manager who's sober? So pathetic. Idiots."}
{"text":"Like most of this franchise the service sucks (slooooooowwwww) and the food is no better than mediocre.  Add to this a lack of talent and you basically have Bennigans."}
{"text":"The wings are delicious. . .. ... Also the atmosphere is exactly as it's supposed to be.  Scantly clad beautiful ladies serving deliciousness and beer."}
{"text":"+.75 If you wanna relive those school girl fantasies or just really like plaid the tilted kilt is a good place to fulfill both.  An average sports bar with the only thing going for them are their racks ( not the rib kind).  The majority of the staff are cute twenty somethings wearing something that came out of last nights roll play session. I'm not complaining because service was quick and friendly   The food on the other hand was meh. The pulled pork tacos had the consistency  of my godsons baby food and tasted as exactly like it, after he threw it up. Nachos were bland with some nasty looking cheese and toppings so poverty my student debt seems like nothing.   Fries were allegedly good although did not try any. According to the others at my table the shepherds pie was saltier than your ex.   The selections of beers was large and varied so you will defiantly find a drink that you'll enjoy. If your out to watch the game or games they have a great set of tvs which is always appreciated. Come here if you want to get reasonably tipsy surrounded with very attractive staff. The food is optional"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner at this location with friends about a week ago and it was very good.  We all had burgers and fish.  Everything was prepared well and cooked as requested.  The manager Renee brought us a complimentary appetizer, a large pretzel with 3 dipping sauces additionally, he brought us a complimentary desert.  With good food and attention like this how can we give it anything other than a 5 star rating?  I should point out that our friends had been there once previously and we had never been there and we have no connection to this establishment whatsoever.  Additionally, they give a 10% veterans discount."}
{"text":"Fried pickles are the best!  Liz was a GREAT waitress!!!  Nice restaurant will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Ok...maybe it was silly for me to go to this place with ANY expectations. I'll break it down for you...if you have a penis you will be taken care of. I guess I was too naive to realize that these chicks aren't here to entertain nor take care of females who walk through their door.   My friend and I went on a Friday after work for just a couple drinks. It wasn't super busy, but they had over a handful of people surrounding the bar area. We chose 2 seats at the bar closest to the river side.   We were served within 5 minutes of sitting down by one of the scantily clad bartenders. She was as cordial as a porcupine.  Both my friend & I ordered a martini, which cost from $8-9 per drink. The quantity was HORRIBLE. My friend's order came in a martini glass which barely filled the halfway point and mine came in a small glass which had BARELY A SHOT in it. We finished those in a swig, and decided to order from another bartender who asked if we needed anything. This chick knew what was up. She gave us the exact amount expected. However, the next time she asked us if we needed anything, I sensed a bitchy vibe from her, which is how she acted the remainder of our time there. I don't recall ever complaining aloud to my friend nor coming off in a snobby way. Who knows what her problem was. Good grief."}
{"text":"We came here for an Employee Appreciation event for my husband's work! A dinner/drinks and Diamondback's game for the employees and their families!!! And it was just before my birthday, so yeah double excited!! We had a big group and they accommodated us perfectly! They knew in advance that we had a large group and they were prepared! the drinks were awesome and the food was divine!!  First time here and I loved it!! Great food, great fun!!! can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"A typical hot Arizona day turned into a fantastically refreshing afternoon thanks to Dani and the staff at the Tilted Kilt. My buddy and I walked in thirsty and worn out from the heat. Both of us were in town for the weekend to see the Patriots and new to the Tilted Kilt experience. Dani, our bartender, introduced herself and made sure we knew all about the menu. She was polite, very friendly, a complete professional and made bit of us feel right at home. I would definitely recommend this place to all of my friends visiting the area and can't thank Dani enough for helping us really enjoy our visit to the area!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I have found this location to be be closed.  Evidently it closed suddenly over the first weekend in April.  After contacting TK Corp, they indicated the franchisee decided to close.  No notice to the regulars was sad.  This place for us had a 'Cheers-like' atmosphere...the bar staff new us, and we knew them.  Very sad it closed and closed so quickly."}
{"text":"A satisfying nooner.   I stopped in to Tilted Kilt of Cleveland for a mid-day treat. Our server, Mia, had it going on! She was friendly, efficient, and attentive to all of our needs.  Added bonus: She was 'easy on the eyes' too.   The Irish nachos were very good. I was expecting yellow cheese but they are actually adorned with a yummy white cheese. The chips were perfect and the tomatoes were fresh. Yum. Our burgers were served as ordered and were the perfect temperature.  Who doesn't love 10 ounces of delicious beef?   Come for the food, the views, or both and I feel you'll be satisfied with your visit. I know I was and will be returning soon."}
{"text":"on a normal day the food makes my stomach turn. it is greasy and the products are low quality. this place is good for a hangover lunch. that's about it. service is slow, my absolute pet peeve. i have a hangover, i want more cola and you're taking a 20 minute smoke break. not cool."}
{"text":"My gf was feeling sick and looking for comfort food, and this place disappointed. After being seated we waited for about ten minutes before being approached by our server, with the girls just standing around talking. Ordered a Bloody Mary, had to return it, it seemed like they poured a can of salt. Asked for a Guineas as a replacement and after about 5 minutes I finally got it. The servers outfits are nice and fit the Vegas attire, pretty girls with great bodies but they lack customer service. We ordered a half rack of ribs, it was OK. Overall poor customer service, but if you want some good eye candy it's the spot."}
{"text":"More recently the new location opened up. Much better location and is very convenient for us. We can walk over to it. They even built a bridge for us to cross over the canal. The new location is also much larger than the old location.   Plenty of TVs in the bar. Lots of seating. We love that they have plugs all over the bar area - below your seats at the bars and along some of the walls. Makes it convenient to charge your phone. Wish more places would have this.   The day we visited it was pretty busy as it was happy hour. Service was good and food was hot and fresh. Happy hour pricing and hours are very nice! We were surprised at how reasonable our tab was.   Beer selection on tap is nice. Wide range of other drink selection. Live band inside during happy hour and. DJ outside on the patio.   I'd give it a solid 4."}
{"text":"Taylor is awesome! Was there for UFC 190 and she rocked it out All night! I have to give it up to the other servers and bar tenders! Great night! This place should be at least a 4 star!"}
{"text":"This place rocks the girls look like girls gone wild !! The food is great and we would go back again and again  The girls look like las vegas girls and they are Hot and they all have DD s  and they are young and giggle"}
{"text":"This place is great for drinks but not for the food. Drinks are always decently priced and always refreshing and good. Awesome place to watch sport events or just to talk to friends. Comfy environment."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and this restaurant park location is always busy and parking is impossible to find at peak times. The restaurant was not busy so we expected good service. Our server was attentive  but the kitchen took 20+mins to get out our burgers. The chicken wings we ordered were good but the over cooked , super salty burger was almost inedible. For $16, I expected a better burger. I know people go to this place for the atmosphere, but if the food is this terrible there will be no repeat customers. I'll probably never go back just because of the food."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars but here we are! I have gone to the website many times with the hope of getting a \"signature dish\" the kilt club, but every time i have tried to order to i have been told it is no longer on the menu yet it is on the website. i even asked for the web address to be sure i was on thee correct address. I was lied to and told the site would be fixed with in the week but now three months later it is still not fixed. plus what fricken bar doesn't have a club sandwich! anyways very displeased, they suck,don't go here!"}
{"text":"I've seen this restaurant a couple of times and I finally decided to give it a try. Came with the inlaws and right away I noticed it was more of a bar type setting and therefore I was not expecting to the food to be good at all. However, the food was surprisingly super yummy! I ordered wings and man they had a lot of meat! My boyfriend said they were the best lemon pepper wings he has ever tried.  The food took a while to get to our table (or maybe we were just starving and seemed like forever) but it was well worth it. The waitress was great! She made she came every so often to see if we needed anything. She even brought us jalapeños for my mother in law (typical mexican) lol"}
{"text":"Tilted Kilt closed down a couple of months ago and did a revamp on the restaurant. Not sure if it was new food, new beer, new look, but I noticed there were new girls there.   Monica was my girl ;), she politely seated us and made some conversation as well. Rowena was our server. You could tell she was new, but the effort was there. The Mediocre, as the Calamari was good but my Big Arse Burger was kinda dry and tasteless. Beer is always good here although they ran out of Delirium, which I could have totally gone for when I was there. I ended up having some Goose Island (Beer from Chicago) which was not quite delirium but it did the job. I haven't been there enough in the past to know what they renovated and changed but everything seems the same except for the staff. I guess people just go there for the Beer and Eye Candy, Very unwrapped Candy... JimStar Out!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Not a tilted kilt experience, unless you want to see no one wearing a kilt! Slovenly staff, sloppy bar, indifferent service!"}
{"text":"I am not going to mark this place down for the outfits. I know the girls are forced to wear them, and few wore them well, but that is the schtick, right? The service was great. Our service was cute and bubbly, so much so I barely registered she was half naked. I thought the food was good. Maybe others did not order the right thing? It is a sports bar, people, don't order a steak and expect Ruth Chris. My husband had the black and blue burger and it was very good. It smelled so good, I grabbed a bite while he was outside on the phone (grandma's 92nd birthday). I split the nachos with my brother. They were good, but I couldn't find the chicken that was supposed to be on them. If you are on Four Square, you can get half off on an appetizer, which was nice because this place i pretty expensive. Even with a $6 deduction, our bill was $50 for 4 beers, a burger, and an appetizer."}
{"text":"Ehh ordered Irish nachos arrived Luke warm not much cheese sauce and the seasoned ground beef was bland and clumpy. Not really a meal I would want to repeat. Really sorry I didn't complain when they came out in asked for more cheese sauce and was informed it's an up charge."}
{"text":"I can't really rate this place too much.   We only had a few drinks but bartender was pleasent enough. It's almost like a hooters but instead of ugly orange shorts and half shirts they are in kilts and half shirts."}
{"text":"Waiting to go to walburgers restaurant. Nice place to stay warm a very friendly atmosphere. Not too overpriced either."}
{"text":"Usually love places like this. Food is typically great and the eye candy is just an added bonus. Typically with the type of girls that may work in a place like this you don't expect the best service in the world but is usually decent or tolerable.   Upon walking in I was ignored for about 30 seconds while the 3 girls talk about a customer that is stalking one of them while dropping F bombs and talking like that of a sailor. One of those girls happened to be my waitress. During the middle of asking what I would like to drink one of the other girls said something to her and she walked away mid sentence yelling foul words and acting like a 14 year old girl.  Like I mentioned before I don't expect amazing service but so far the girls have seemed like  real winners.  There should still be a certain level of professionalism. Yes even at places like this.  Also did I mention it took 30+ minutes to get another beer and my fries/wings?"}
{"text":"This is where I can catch a Red Sox game in the West on a big screen and enjoy myself. They have a drink here called the Green Monster...order it and you'll feel the buzz. Guys love it here because the servers wear very tight halter tops that tie above the navel and have lots of cleavage. I like it because the boys here are big, handsome and love to have a good time!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in on Wednesday,  11/16/2016 around 3 p.m. for lunch. We ordered beers and a menu. The bartender brought us our drinks and said she would be right back with our menus....which were literally directly behind her....all she had to do was reach behind her and grab our menus. Instead, she went to the end of the bar to our right, made 2 drinks and fetched 2 beers for a waitress, got new drinks for 2 or 3 other customers, and tabbed out a couple of folks. I walked down to the end of the bar and asked her AGAIN for menus...she said, \"I'll be right there\". She walked RIGHT PAST US and the menus TWICE without reaching her hand out to grab one for us. She even waited on 2 customers on the left of us....AGAIN walking past the menus....before she FINALLY stopped, directly in front of us, back to us, and grabbed 2 menus. We had been there 10 minutes and would have already known what we wanted and could have, at this point, placed our order. She was clearly being obstinate and showing us that she'll get our menus when SHE wants to...not when WE wanted them. when she brought our menus....FINALLY!!!....I told her to just tab me out. I paid...no tip...and we went elsewhere for our meal. Whoever at this restaurant reads this review, you need to seriously take a look at your bartenders, at least one of whom is pushing business away from your restaurant. Completely not the point of any business. This is why I was very specific as to when we were there....so the manager can know who was working the bar at the time. I do not know her name but she is very in love with herself, has longish dark hair, and is very proud of her tattoos...one of which is a large flower at the top of her thigh or perhaps on her hip. Very visible however.. Horrible waitress. Horrible face of the Tilted Kilt.  She should be fired immediately and whomever hires her should also beware."}
{"text":"I have been to the kilt a few times due to my friends like to go watch various sporting games there I've never been impressed this place truly sucks. It has never been my favorite place to begin with due to many factors. If I can give this review less than one star I would. The worst thing about this place is the service by far!"}
{"text":"This place has potential but I didn't care for the layout.  Long bar is neat but instead of all the small tv's they should have put in bigger one's and spread them out.  The large screens are neat, but sitting in the uncomfortable chairs sitting to close to them was bad planning.  I believe the owner is a Sooners fan so that game rules over others, even Devils games.  The volume wasn't on for the Devils game, wth.  Waitress was lazy, didn't come by the table often.  Chicken Tenders were good, with sweet and sour sauce.  Sweet Potato Fries are gross, doesn't taste anything like 'em.  I'd go to hang out and not expect much in the future."}
{"text":"Came here around 10 on a Sunday night with just one server,  who immediately informed us that the kitchen is already closed.  So we just decided to have some drinks at the bar.  No complaints about the sexy server,  but I expected more enthusiasm.  She looked like  she'd rather go home than serve us.  No small talk,  no thank you."}
{"text":"Went there last night for Bike Night Sponsored by Arrowhead Harley Davidson. Was pretty excited about it being as though Id never been to Tilted Kilt. Me and a friend rode our bikes there. Turnout was great, maybe 60-70 bikes. We were some of the first to go in to the restaurant and my friend ordered a Blue Moon. They were out. Ordered a Linenkugel. They were out. He just said hed take a Coke. My turn to order, I ordered a Stella. Guess what, they were out! When we got our tickets, they had several items reversed so they had to re-write them. Got them corrected and them gave our tickets to the wrong people. What a mess when this event had been planned for weeks! How do you not stock up on beer for a biker event?"}
{"text":"Table was sticky and restaurant had kind of a gross feel. My guest had a beer and waitress made a big deal about how it was out of state saying she wasn't supposed to accept it but would this one time. My drink required Red Bull and she said that they were out but she used her personal Red Bull to make it. Food was good, server was hard to find at time. This is not a family restaurant, as most people know, but would be good for guys hanging out."}
{"text":"Came here after a Browns game to watch the rest of the NFL games. It was packed at first but we did find a place at the bar. Had no issues here. A yuengling draft was i think $6. Food was average bar food. Bartenders were personable and cute and were prompt to check if you needed anything."}
{"text":"Service poor.  Waiting way too long for my drink order, so long the Manager had to come over and expedite it.  Food is basic bar food....ok.  Convenient to my hotel was the only plus."}
{"text":"If you are in the area, check out the Tilted Kilt! The service is always great and the patio is perfect for this time of year...plenty of TVs if you are a sports fan!"}
{"text":"Garlic Fries are AWESOME!!!  The Girls with the skirts and boobs are awesome although sometimes they can be quite aloof.   Tues night Craps games is awesome.  Good place to watch football on sunday.  Most of the food is so so.  Fun place to meet friends."}
{"text":"Nooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I went here on a Saturday evening to watch college football with friends, because when you watch college football you need beer and the bigger the selection the better.  I don't mind that all the waitresses are female (girl power) or that they're in short skirts and a bra (motivates me to want to get skinny for a quick minute).     The size of the venue is great!  I could imagine when the Pirates/Steelers are in town b/c it's so close to Heinz Field and PNC Park it's probably packed!  I get it.  Lots of tables.  The servers are all women with short skirts and bras, so if you're ok with scantily clad women you're good.  It honestly motivates me to want to do some sit ups, but I'd rather have the beer menu in preparation for my hibernation during the winter.  It was Saturday evening, and all of the other restaurants on \"Restaurant Row\" were pretty packed. When I say this place was dead it is an understatement.  There were maybe  4 tables in the big open area nearest the road.  They might as well have closed down for the evening.  Got there around 7:30 pm and it felt like the air conditioning was off.  Nothing says \"welcome\" like turning off the A/C.  I wanted to immediately go somewhere else, but we were with a group of people and already told them we were coming to the Tilted Kilt.  The beer selection is just \"ok\".  I had a couple of \"Yvengling\" because they didn't have any Octoberfest/Pumpkin beers (and before anyone gives me any grief about it being September, in Germany they celebrate Oktoberfest in Sept/Oct and I consider them the experts).  There was a UFC fight that started toward the 4th quarter of the college football game we were watching.  There were only two tables left full of people (as well as people at the bar): the other table was 2 adults and 6 kids and my table was 8 adults.  The kids table was watching the UFC fight. My table was watching college football drinking beer.  Management decided to turn on the sound to the UFC fight, but they turned the sound up so high we had to yell to talk to our server and each other.  That was a HUGE sign that they don't like money (because we were drinking beer and eating food) and the other table was just there to watch the fight.  We left immediately after in complete disgust. My ear drums are still ringing from that night.  If they treated us like this on a slow night I can only imagine what happens during a sporting event/concert.  Try it at your own risk!  I've had enough Tilted Kilt for a few years.  I'm going to work on my beer belly somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped here right after the Pitt - Rutgers game. The bar area was pretty packed but there were plenty of tables available in the back.  Lots of tv's and they also had a DJ playing music.  I'm not sure if he's quiet during a Pitt / Steelers game (hopefully).  We got a couple of tall boys and stood near the bar.    We did not try any of the food.  Yes the staff dresses \"down\" and depending on your group that's a good or bad thing.    I'd try it again before or after a game."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced and service is crappy. Servers are like 20 year olds dressed up in go go dancer outfits.Kind of like an Irish Hooters. At least at Hooters they have better service. Not really a comfortable place for girls."}
{"text":"By far the worst tilted kilt I've been to. Ever time I give it another try I sit at the bar for a good 15 minutes before getting a drink I've even had to get up and just walk out. Good thing there are plenty of other choices within walking distance from my hotel."}
{"text":"I gave this place another chance. I am very satisfied with my new experience. I hope they keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a year, went here with my girlfriend the other night , and I ordered chicken wings and they brought it with french fries the chicken wings were soggy and the french fries were soggy!!! The girls are very nice there good looking , good service , the drinks are fine but the food is from 1 to 10 it's a -20"}
{"text":"My business partner and I stopped in for lunch yesterday.  He had a burger and I had the fish and chips.  Both were standard bar fare; it's not bad and it's not great.  I expected the atmosphere to be more lively.  At noon, the place was near empty and the energy was stale.  This location is in the suburbs.  For the tables that were occupied, it was predominantly seniors.  I found the bars and restaurants in downtown Phoenix to be more my speed."}
{"text":"Missed my bus so instead of crying at the stop, I decided to grab a brew at downtown's Tilted Kilt. Right when I walked in, I was greeted by a super pretty girl in a super sexy kilt. Then I looked around and realized I was surrounded by a bunch of pretty girls in super tight white shirts and kilts. Even the guys were wearing kilts. It was super rad. I immediately fell in love with the place. I decided to sit at the bar next to a regular who calls himself Breezy Cool. Despite my initial skepticism, I realized after a couple of sentences that Breezy Cool was a real, down-to-earth, respectful gentleman. He wanted nothing but good things for everyone around him. This may be due to his gambling \"good karma\" tendency but he truly meant well. The woman bartending was super hot, not gonna lie. She was super fit and had this sexy librarian look going on. She even tried the Soup of the Day for me and recommended to get just the cup due to the heavy cream base it entailed. She was very polite and helpful. I was extremely satisfied with the wait time for the food and the friendliness of the staff. Not too crowded or loud on a Monday night. Finally the soup was delicious. It was a chicken tortilla soup along with a small pub salad for a snack. It had a nice kick to it afterwards. I will definitely go back with some friends on a monday night or if I happen to ever miss the bus again."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a cab driver when I asked him where was a good place to buy drinks and have food.  The cab driver gave me the address, and then called my boyfriend's cell phone back to apologize because he gave us the wrong address.  So I realized that it's pretty hard to find a restaurant that is opened late around Bell so we ended up here.  UMMM, I didn't realize that it was like a hooters, but with uglier girls.  The only decent one was the hostess at the front door, where most people enter and think all of them have to be decent looking but they are all ugly.  They had no hips and no butts. And bad teeth. And they sang off key.  The worse were the creepy old geezers that come in and just stare at these poor girls.  And pretend to have birthdays so they can have 4 half naked girls sing at their table.    I give it two stars because I liked the fact that they had plenty of TVs.  The black and bleu burger was really good, the clam strips were ehh, really tough and really greasy.  My boyfriend got the sausage artichoke fettuccini which was a little greasy too and too heavy.  But I'd rather go to Hooters!"}
{"text":"I won't be going back here.   The service was slow.  I don't drink beer, and I guess they really expect you to here.  The food was the best part, it was large and fairly good, but took forever to get.  It was loud, and uniforms and rowdy beer drinkers and sports watchers make is very bad for families.  They have a ton of TV's with different sport things, all loud."}
{"text":"Ugh. I s practically the only one in the place on a Wednesday night. The order was completely wrong. Like she didn't even hear what I said but brought 'stuff' to the table. Then it took forever to get a check and pay my bill. Short skirts just aren't worth it."}
{"text":"If you are a middle aged dude who wants to enjoy a cold brew while you ogle waitresses, this is what this place is for.   However, skip the food.  It's just not good.  If you are not a middle aged dude  and are instead going here with your family, then you should probably question who you are as a parent.  Seriously, take the family to Zipps instead for a much better meal, plus maybe your daughter won't grow up and end up working at a place like this."}
{"text":"-Lots of screens to watch the game -No bad seat in the house, there are just less gooder seats -The waitresses are nice I guess. They show their bellies. -Wings are under spicy'd. Go for hotter rating than you think you can handle -Pretty expensive for locals, but it's the strip.  Come here if you want to: watch a sporting game, if hooters is too sexy for you, but you still want mediocre wings Do not come here: if you do not like sports, alcohol and kilts.... if you do not like spending money on overpriced wings."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time 09/15/14 with a table of 10 from my company. The servers were friendly and my mushroom swiss burger was very tastey. I will eat there again..."}
{"text":"Went here on recommendation knew we were going to a version of hooters so it is what it is.  Service was really good although our waitress was a little slow maybe too many tables to cover but she tried really hard.  Food avg at best we had a burger which we sent back because it was totally burnt.   Galic chicken was ok just ok.  Overall if you are looking for good food go somewhere else.  If you sre looking for eye candy and beers fine go in they try hard."}
{"text":"Tilted kilt is changing to Tipsy Coyote. Place is being renovated. Dinner came out a little cold. Not the server fault."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend that was in the same class I went to and we went because he had been here before and it was recommended by a few of the other guys who were going to the school I was at. When I got in the place, right away I thought it was nothing more then a highly rated bar.  The whole place is centered around the big bar in the middle with table seating flowing out from that. There was one pool table there with a slim selection of pool cues and at $2.00 a game, I would have at least expected to hand chalk for ease of play.   The girls there were not as advertised all though there was one or two that were extremely nice looking and wondered why they were working here and not at a more sophisticated establishment.  There is seating outside but we went outside to have a smoke. While out there we had a guy walk up and give us a story that his car broke down and wanted to know if we had any spare change we could give him. When we declined, he proceeded to ask everyone that was in the area.   Nice place to go if you are into the bar scene. This will more likely be my only visit here."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service left a lot of room for improvement. We asked for water right away and didn't get it for 10 minutes,then I ordered the half salad and got the full ,she then offered to take it back and get the half , as I was already eating it I said no so I got charged for full. Asked for dressing on side. Didn't get that. Someone ordered fish and chips and asked to make sure there were no pickles or condiments on plate. It came with pickles and had to be sent back. I ordered Gaelic chicken with fettuccine. It came with mashed potatoes and had to be sent back. The other two waited to eat till corrections were made so their food was cold. Then when checks came someone was double charged! Come on train your waitresses!!!"}
{"text":"Must say upon entering the building was a little confused...I thought this was an Irish Pub? Decor is sport bar/ rock and roll/ dive bar with nice wood bar and tables and chairs. Music was everything from country to Rap..no bagpipes...lol  Waitstaff wore what looked like they were supposed to be kilts (or kilt-like). They were super short with bras to match. Might as well been at Hooters. Menu definately was not Irish pub, they don't even have fish and chips...   But, I must say..service was prompt and attentive. I guess I spoke soon. I was still in the establishment while  writing this review. BF went to the mens restroom and he was totally disgusted. Said it smelled like a \"drive in bathroom\" and was very dirty. Also...service got worse the longer we were there. With only 4 people left in the whole placed she never noticed I was out of a drink for almost 15 minutes. (I was even to the restroom and back) \""}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night after a Sun's game and I was pleasantly surprised. The service was really good & the food was great too -- I got the chicken quesadilla. Would definitely come back if I happen to be downtown."}
{"text":"I said in my first review that I probably wouldnt be coming back but guess what, I did and I am bumping it up one star for the food.  Getting straight to the important stuff.  We ordered: -Classic traditional wings w/garlic fries -Sweet potato fries -Spinach Chicken Salad -SpicySouthwest Chicken Wrap w/colelsaw  -BBQ Chicken pizza  The wings were good and I liked that they were saucey but not to the point that they were drowning in it.  It came with celery and ranch but no carrots :(  The garlic fries it came out with though, sooooo damn good and garlic-y! YUM.  They were seriously like the definition of perfection and I seriously could not stop eating them.     Sweet potato fries were also really good.  They were definitely different from how they are usually served as they were crinkle cut fries and I really appreciated that they weren't soggy or super soft like how crinkle cut fries usually are.  It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.  Perfect when dipped in ranch or ketchup.  My friends ordered the Spinach Chicken Salad to share which came with a citrus mustard vinagarette dressing that was really unique but tasty.  The salad consisted of fresh spinach, grilled chicken, hard-boiled eggs, chopped bacon, dried cranberries and bleu cheese crumbles.  Everything paired very well with each other and it is definitely a salad I'd recommend ordering.  My boyfriend and I shared the Spicy Southwest Chicken wrap again because thats his favorite thing at Tilted Kilt.  It was consistent with my first time trying it and a dish I'd still recommend to others.  It's light but filling!  I really appreciate the fact that they use just the right amount of dressing in the wrap and consisted of a good ratio of salad to chicken. The wrap also comes with your choice of fries, potato chips or coleslaw.  We opted for the coleslaw since we already had 2 baskets of fries.  It's a small portion of coleslaw but I didn't mind since I was already getting full from the other stuff.  The BBQ chicken pizza was your standard BBQ chicken pizza.  Nothing stood out about it but it wasn't bad; it was just average.  Nothing much to say about it.  The service this time was better than last as all the girls working greeted us upon entering and our server made sure to check up on us from time to time.  The food however, did take quite awhile to come out but it was understandable since we were here during the Fight Weekend and it was much more busier than usual."}
{"text":"I love this place, and I understand that for a UFC fight, there is gonna be some backlog. But the two hour backlog in the kitchen and not being able to put in a food order is ridiculous!!! Haley has been an amazing server and totally deserves a raise though!!!"}
{"text":"Alyssa the hostess was super sweet.   Our server Tasia was on it.  Very friendly. The  food was good my buddy loved the fish tacos.  I had the chicken pasta    Back 5 months later and OMG I love ALI .  Food and service were good too.   I need to come here more often"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a couple of my co-workers because they haven't been there before.  Of course anything downtown looking for parking is horrible, but as long as your parking on cityscape parking area they can stamp it so no need to pay for parking.  Service was eh, no one was there to greet us right away, I think they just happen to walk away as we entered, to maybe seat someone before us.  Anyways it wasn't packed because we just got there before it did, well it took a few minutes till we got seated.  No server came to us for a good 5-10 minutes, and we were like WTH there's not that  much people in here yet, anyways our server finally came and focus on us for awhile, while we decided what we wanted and she started looking around like she was ignoring us, it seems like she was looking or waiting on someone.  As soon as she got our order she immediately went to a table of older guys who just happen to be seated(I'm assuming there regulars/big tippers) she was flirting with them which i don't care, but at least put our order in 1st and then flirt!! Well since it was our lunch break and time was not on our hands, and the food finally came, but we said if we could have it to go now, because we needed to go back to work, she gave us a dirty look and a big sigh but i'll give her credit she smiled when she did that, but hey if she only put our order first we would have gladly eaten there. Anyways overall my co-workers wasn't impress with the place, I've gone there a few times and yes it has happen to me before, but I went when it was busy and that day it wasn't that busy right away.  Were gonna try twin peaks hopefully there service is better, sorry tilted  kilt :("}
{"text":"This is a stereotypical \"Irish pub\" (though it feels more Scottish in theme) in Phoenix. It's a themed bar with American food with only the occasional British/Irish-inspired entrée (your normal Shepard's Pie or pasty among normal burgers and fries). The décor is definitely more interesting than the menu. To top it off, the wait staff is 99% female in skimpy plaid school girl style outfits that only appeals to a certain (male, horny) demographic. If I want Irish food, there are way better, more authentic places close by.   However, with that said, the garlic parmesan fries are pretty tasty and the burger patty and bacon were both thick and cooked perfectly to order. Can't speak for the alcohol selection because I've never ordered any here (I only come here with my dad since it's decently priced and right next to his house) but he's never complained.  This is a sports bar, not an Irish pub by any means. If you want sports and boobs, come here. If you want good food and atmosphere, go to Cornish Pasty Company or even Fibber Magee's, both just a few miles west."}
{"text":"Hooters with a slightly better menu. Service was not great, but I can give that a pass as the place just recently opened. Good selection of beers, but the waitress didn't know what they had..."}
{"text":"Went into watch a little football. Ordered Baileys on the rocks...it's an Irish bar so that should be no problem right? Oh ummmm sorry we're out of Baileys Irish cream. Hmmmm seriously SMH!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast and to watch the morning football game. Not a bad place, clean, service was good. I didn't particularly like the breakfast menus and had the breakfast burrito, there was no real flavor to it. My wife had a breakfast platter and it was the same. We didn't order lunch when the time came bit did see some plates and they looked pretty good! Everything is overpriced but that's what you get these days going to Vegas. Lots of TV'S so you can see one from every seat."}
{"text":"Tilted Kilt taught me something, huge breasts and a pretty face will never ever replace quick, courteous, attentive service.  Watching the game, it took me a good 10 minutes for the waitress to even ask me what I wanted to drink.  I ordered my food and beer, but for some stupid reason, the food came out before the beer (No head on it either, so clearly it was sitting around for a bit).  Of course, after I finished my beer, it took another 20 minutes for the waitress to ask if I wanted another.  During those 20 minutes, I was looking for my waitress, and of course I see her standing around in the front of the door, chatting with other waitresses, or flirting with other guys for more tips.  Either way, I want my beer.  Doesn't help the food wasn't that good either, and I wasn't able to eat it with nothing to wash it down.  I rather just head over to Hooters.    Where is that great Irish Pub?  I'm 0-3 already."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with the wife , the egg appetizer different but very good as was the dip they give you with it, also had the pork street tacos , parmesan wings and habanero wings , 2 beers and iced tea $45 was reasonable, waiter forgot her name but very friendly, would much rather prefer this place than Hooters , they even have a game room, be back soon"}
{"text":"I didn't have high hopes for this place initially when it opened. I thought it would be another run-of-the-mill sports bar. I was wrong!  I was pleasantly surprised! I know the concept is cheesy but honestly the service here is EXCELLENT. The waitresses are the friendliest I've ever had in Cleveland. They are adorably sweet and I find it cute that they sometimes sit down with you to take your order. I feel it makes the experience more personal and I really enjoy it! And yes I know it's tacky and inappropriate the way they have little \"kilts\" on, but whatever. It doesn't bother me.  As for the food, it is some of the best \"bar\" food I have had in Cleveland. It's definitely above-average. The menu is typical including wings, sandwiches, comfort-food appetizers, etc. but they are oh so delicious!   I highly recommend this place if you're looking for that sports bar atmosphere and looking for quick, inexpensive, bar food!"}
{"text":"Food was pub food, tasty but not amazing. Girls in short skirts and shirts. I'd go again if I were drunk after a Pirate's game!"}
{"text":"Really?  We were told there is a 15 minute wait.  Hmmm.  I see at least 20 empty and clean tables.  What's wrong?  Not prepared for a busy night with the World Series on?  Maybe all the staff that is hanging out and not busy should get to work service customers!  You just lost a regular customer!"}
{"text":"The other reviews mentioned poor service. They were right to mention it and so will I. Our server did Get to our table in a timely manner but that was all she did correctly. The wrap I got was good, the fries were frozen sweet potato fries and very bland. The server had one other table than ours but disappeared after delivering our food. My drink went dry after my second bite and since our server was doing something other than serving I had to choke the rest of my food down. Barely dressed servers work at hooters, here not so much. Never again."}
{"text":"I had driven by many times with a curious desire to try this obvious theme restaurant.  I would surely say, stop by and enjoy the friendly service and very different menu. The decor en lights the experience and you have a nicely served menu which seems to make it a delightful stop as to change your taste buds up. This is not a place you would make your daily drinking our eating hole, but full of a themed tasteful Irish/American reminder that the ethnic food business has a new tasteful enjoyment and quality eating and drinking memory to add to your resume. Very nice borderling on excellent.!! Hoping being a multi location establishment in various cities does keep me from giving it the 5 stars in such a find. As the old saying to many cooks spoil the broth. Not yet but let's see if it becomes to large of a effort."}
{"text":"Came here for the Packer cowboy game. Ordered a beer didn't see the waitress for over 45 minutes. Our table was here to spend money but they forgot about us."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a Suns game with some friends. We sat out on the porch since the place was filthy on the inside.   The patio is really cool and sits on the 2nd or 3rd floor of a building so you're looking out over downtown.   Service was great as per usual. My only complaint is the cleanliness of the establishment. Literally everything was filthy. From my sticky chair to my dirty pint glass. I would love to come back to this place if it were just cleaner."}
{"text":"Same as the other locations, except that this one has some tables in a weird accommodation. Girls always smiling and ready to please specially male costumers, but that too helps when you want a good and efficient service.  Food is regular bar food and my friend was a bit disappointed that the spicy chorizo sandwich was not spicy at all. Well maybe next time! At least is another (better) option from places to go when you are going to Symphony Hall."}
{"text":"what better combination for a regular guy: boobs and sports! needless to say I only stop here 'cos one of my male friends is celebrating something. Service is ok, and of course the kilted ladies will do all to get her tips....but don't complain if they forgot your drink was on happy hour, or that you can't eat a steak without cutlery.   For beers...I rather sit always ten times at 4peaks!"}
{"text":"Never go here!!! Staff is horrible and food is even worse. The manager Frank is an ass that told me to leave becuse his bartender harassed me and i was the bad guy! His bartender told the whole restaurant i harassed him yet i was with my husband. Been here many times and got the same treatments.  I am done giving chances and ill never return! They treated me like a prisoner and grabbed me by the arm and took me outside to talk, totally uncalled for!!!!."}
{"text":"Black And Bleu Burger was very good.  Bleu cheese isn't overpowering and the burger patty had a nice smokey taste.  Could have done without the manager/waitress drama a few feet away from me though.  Take it to the office! Professionalism & self control are going out the window in today's America!"}
{"text":"Went there on April 8th it was one of the best restaurants I have been too. The beer selection is amazing, the menu has great food. The atmosphere is even better, between the tv's all over the Resturant the girls are dressed in school girl outfits it's definitely a place to go. Think a Scottish Hooters."}
{"text":"The worst experience I've had in years. First when we walked in the side door, we asked do we seat ourselves & told to \"go up front\" we should have left.  Wow nice warm greeting - not.   When we asked to sit on the other side of the restaurant, because it was more quiet, we copped attitude immediately from that girl.  Should have left then.  Brought our beers over, wrong beer for me but I drank it anyway.  Nacho Chips is a pleasant change for a homemade potato chip.  However 8 min later our dinners were served.  Are you kidding me!  Didn't even get 1/2 way thru platter and now dinner is in front of us.  On top of that,  my chicken breast was so over cooked, I could barely cut it.  Manager came over to table but she wasn't very pleasant either.  Took the dinner with us & gave it to a homeless man in Pgh.  We will never visit again."}
{"text":"This is no longer a Tilted Kilt .   The name is now \"The Drowned Coyote\" and the gals wear black shorts at Tee-Shirts"}
{"text":"Really, honestly, bad.   I literally dropped in 12 months ago, about the time they opened the establishment. It was kinda of lacking in many ways but service was good enough. This time I sat at the bar and ordered a cocktail and a turkey burger. Nothing about the situation was quality. I won't even go into the cocktail issues as really it was just the bartender not listening. I drank it.. Lol.  I ordered the turkey burger while sitting at the bar in an attempt to keep it lighter. The turkey burger was meant to have guacamole on it .. Which it did .. barely.. But as it was literally 24min from order to delivery of the food - I didn't complain.   The burger was boring. I know turkey burgers don't always get the best reviews overall - but there is no reason they should taste literally like cardboard. Especially in this day and age of over-priced, extremely casual dinner fare. You can at least have it not taste bad. I didn't eat it. It was not good. I ordered them with potato chips which were over cooked and cardboard like as well. When he basket was picked up eventually, it was without question of why it was over half  un-eaten.  In addition, I was asked to pay for my food before it arrived, which I found odd. I was informed that I needed to give a credit card if I wanted to eat at the bar. I reluctantly gave a card and requested that it not be charged because I wanted to pay cash. I was then told - \"anytime you eat at a bar in Vegas, you are required to pay up front.\" I was like ... what? Hahah.   After that - the bartender never checked on me once, as he was constantly talking with his friends and juggling bottles. All of that is fine - if you can give proper service. Otherwise .. Please focus on your guests.  I asked for the check - and I waited literally 18 minutes to receive the check - which the bartender charged to my credit card after I once again, asked him to allow me to pay cash. He took off and didn't even give me a pen. I went to the hostess stand and asked the manager there for a pen.   I mean it was just not a good situation and I have no reason to go back. If it weren't truly bad I wouldn't go this far as to be so descriptive - but it was that bad. I'm a believer in allowing a situation to be fixed - but I had little opportunity and I just wanted out of there. Better luck to you if you decide to check it out. Happy eating !"}
{"text":"Wow this place is by far the worst Tilted Kilt I've been in. Beer tasted like crap and the chips were stale. The bathrooms were filthy and my wife said only 2 stalls worked in the womans bathroom along with the soap dispensers that were broken and laying on the counter. I'd be embarrassed if I was the manager of this place. Had to edit. On the way out the bartender/manager left the bar to go outside to make out with someone. We also happened to see the kitchen. Wow! Health inspector should pay them a visit."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my wife at 12:00 o'clock to grab a bite and was never even greeted at the hostess stand despite several employees standing around and pretty much looking at us like we were stupid. So after standing there for about 5 minutes we turned around and walked right out passed an obvious employee (in a kilt) who just watched us stand at the podium while she sat there and talked to a group of dudes!! NICE .......   P.S. Caesar entertainment needs to step their game up...we went to multiple properties at the Link and Flamingo and were greeted with terrible, rude or non-existent service. I know Mgm properties are always a good time and their employees are well known for friendliness . Needless to say we won't be going back to the Link any time soon because I've also had a terrible experience at Chayo and Margaritaville. Anyway we ended up at the Grand Lux which is always good and highly recommended from this wannabe foodie Las Vegas Local."}
{"text":"Me and my family stopped for lunch.  Food was delicious, the staff were all superb.  I have never seen so many friendly staff members.  we loved it.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"Not for families, unless you want your kids staring at your waitresses' breasts bouncing all over the place....  the beer and bar was good, a little expensive so they can pay for the overhead, I guess."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Service by far the shittiest I've had. But then again i guess you can't expect much from a place with half naked servers.... Couldn't even find a manager to complain about waiting 20 minutes after being done with our food. Never again."}
{"text":"Spending a few days in Cleveland. All the way from Mt. Airy NC. aka...Mayberry  Beer is cold. Shepherd's Pie is good. Happy New Year!!"}
{"text":"Tilted? More like inflexible. Came here for my husband's birthday and our waitress simply wouldn't work with our needs. We're allergic to onions and wanted the sampler, and asked to trade out the onion rings for something else, like extra Mozarella sticks. Taysia refused. She said the chefs were completely \"unwilling to work with that.\" We told her about the allergy and she just stared at us in annoyance. We felt unwelcome and like a burden. The restaurant was not busy, the service was terrible, and she kept rushing us to leave. We came in for appetizers and a fun environment, not Valley Girl attitude and generic fried food that is supposedly impossible to customize."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!!!! Our server Christine was a delight very clean restaurant no complaints"}
{"text":"Get over the girls in kilts already. Didn't Hooters already bark this tree out? Whatever, food is good, but not worth that price! The atmosphere is sophomoric and annoying. If you are some kind of douchebag go here so I don't have to be annoyed with you somewhere that I am."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, plenty of healthy options that taste excellent. Service was ok, waitress was very attentive to our tables needs, however her jugs were larger than my head which was, to say the least, intimidating. That being said, I will be back."}
{"text":"I have never been to a place where everyone is treated so well.  Its so nice to see a staff that cares about everyone's visit amazing!   The way the staff greats so many of the customers by name tells me I need to com back often!  Take some time go visit!!  So many great people!  Say Hi to Leeandra, Natasha and the lovely Ms Sandra!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, better than the last time, but still not top notch. I tried the pulled pork sandwhich, but I should have had the philly cheesteak. There were an unusually large number of drunk guys in the middle of the day."}
{"text":"I think I ate more of my husband's garlic fries than he did, and my sweet potato fries with the cayenne ranch were so delish! It was very crowded due to some sporting event, but the service was pretty fast & they kept up on our drinks. I've heard that it depends on the night, but my burger was absolutely flavorless, blah, nothing special and I will probably never eat a burger there again. What's dumb, is that it looked mouth-watering, just tasted like nothing."}
{"text":"Food is crap. Service is slow. They do have lots of beers on tap. The place was dead when I was here ."}
{"text":"Ask for Iesha: great waitress. Food was delicious service was great. Thanks Iesha.    We tried a couple of different items on the menu on our visit.     I had fish tacos with chips and salsa. The tacos were delicious. If you like to venture outside of the burger and fries deal then give the tacos a try.    I was with a group of people on this visit. They had the hot mess burger with chili and cheese. Of course I had to try this delicious fork and knife burger. It would be my next choice when I go back.     When I opened up my Yelp app this restaurant had a coupon for a free appetizer. I am pretty sure it was called the Irish nachos. This was really good but we were all so full that we couldn't eat everything plus the appetizer that I ordered after we got out food.      It's a little pricey here but the food quality and service was worth it."}
{"text":"Le bon piège à touriste de base. Oui ok, à Las Vegas nous sommes tous des touristes, mais de là à payer 12 dollars pour une Guinness, faut pas délirer non plus ... On est juste dans un pub, pas un 5 étoiles !   Alors oui ok, il y a des serveuses sexy... Oui bon moi j'ai été servi par un garçon en kilt, pas de chance me direz-vous :)  Ah oui, et à peine on me pose le verre on me demande direct ma carte bleue pour ouvrir un compte. Non ça va aller merci, je finis ça et je pars direct !  Il y a tellement d'autres endroits sympa pour boire un verre..."}
{"text":"I had high hopes but the fact that after sitting at my table for 20 minutes with no one even coming by was a deal breaker. The restaurant wasn't crowded and I watched 3 other tables around me get called on and served multiple time while I waited. I couldn't get the servers attention so I eventually just left."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and my inlaws second time here. As noted, both times were outstanding experiences.   The service was fanatic. We were there for hours upon hours watching our favorite Hockey team play. She was friendly, hot and checked in on us frequently.   The decor was perfect for an Irish pub. Greens and browns with plenty of beers all around. Irish sayings on the wall.   The food. OMG the food. The nachos are out of this world. They are just as good dipped in buffalo sauce. The Irish dip sandwich was out of this world. The Gaelic chicken dish was phenomenal. My fiancé and I shared it.   The beers on Tap were fresh and cold. Everyone in the place was Friendly... All of the servers took good care of us, and we have zero complaints. We even requested a specific game and they gratefully put it on for us.   As the \"out of Towners,\" you can bet we will be back again next time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, my in-laws and I came here to watch the soccer game,  rooting for USA.  So obviously, the place was PACKED! So it's understandable that service was extremely slow. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 fat tires, and it took a while to get them, but we were distracted by the game. When we received it, I thought the glasses was HUGE! At least compared to other places.  The waitresses are extremely nice, however, I noticed a few just standing around by the entrance just chatting, when instead they could be helping the customers.  We did not order anything to eat because as busy as it is, we did not feel like waiting.  Once the game was over, a lot of people just left the pub. There was hardly anyone in there. We ordered another 2 fat tires and just pretty relaxed and enjoyed watching the television.   When it was time to get our check, the waitress took almost 30 minutes to get it to us. About 17 minutes in, she came back and said she forgot what we needed.  It would be understandable if the pub was still packed, but it wasn't."}
{"text":"Annalysa was very nice and helpful for us! Made great suggestions ... and did her thing. When i go back , i will definitely ask to be seated in her section!"}
{"text":"My best man took me, my wedding party,friends, and some family out to Tilted Kilt in June for my bachelor party. My best man made reservations, but after arriving are table wasn't ready yet. They ended up giving us to choices on were to sit. After everyone got seated we ordered are drinks. At first are waitress got confused but after repeating the order she got it right. It took along time to get are drink but in time we did get them. Later we ordered are food. We got the food in a timely manor plus the food was pretty good (least what i remembered). Through out the night we ordered more drinks and had a good time. Because it was my bachelor party they gave me a drink with a drinking i had to do which was fun. Later I over heard that they charged my party for the drink. Overall the main reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 stars. The eye candy was nice and the food was pretty good. I will give Tilted Kilt another chance next time I am out this way. If your planning a bachelor party, you may like this place, then again you may not. Either way I still had a good time along with most of my party."}
{"text":"First, there's minimal A/c (it's 100 degrees outside!) Second, there's minimal a/c (it's freakin 100 degrees outside!!) The service was ok."}
{"text":"I love Tilted Kilt. They have very beautiful girls who are fun to talk to. The management is pleasant. There's always cool sports games on the TV's. I like to go here regularly before suns games and when I go to the comicons at the convention center. I lost my car downtown and they let me sit in the restaraunt and offered to charge my phone and the waitress spent a few minutes to talk to me. Plus on St Patrick day they had a special menu and the waitress gave me some green beads I could wear before I went over to watch the suns and golden state. Thank you and I will be returning before the next suns game. Shay is also an awesome waitress. She should be a therapist lol she listened to my problems and I wasn't even drunk. I was just a lonely loser eating fried pickles"}
{"text":"Good food, snobby waitress.  We waited a long time for our food orders.  No problem, but the attitude from our waitress did not help at all.  Very surprising as the Linq overall is very good.  No problem as there are plenty of other restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. It took 20 min for a waitress to take our drink order 15 min later we had to go to the bar to get our drink. The waitress has yet to clean off the previous customers food off the table or even ask for our order in food!  To top it off its not even busy. This is our second time here the first was just as bad. I can say this will be our last time."}
{"text":"Yeah, not my kind of place.  Granted, I knew that when I walked in the door, or really about 50 meters down the road, but I was 21 a long time ago, and this place is not really for you if you're not still enjoying the novelty of being able to buy beer.   But, there really aren't a lot of options on North Shore Dr, and before an event at Heinz, your choices are very limited.  The servers are friendly enough, but obviously overworked, and the lack of any clear organization basically means it's up to you to try and flag one down.   Food was decent enough, a bit overpriced.  It was so loud I could barely hear myself think.  But they have a lot of seating, and to their credit, they got us in and out in under an hour."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Tilted Kilt. It's a good sports bar, lots of TVs playing games and not too loud, clean, etc. I liked the long bar in the center, it looks like a long shuffleboard table that you can sit on either side of, good for a small or large crowd. The staff was friendly, always making sure I had enough jack and coke (which was on happy hour so how could I say no?) I really liked the tk Irish nachos. I thought this place would be kind of like hooters but I felt like it was more like a regular sports bar, just with a theme. Maybe I've been to way too many clubs and bars that have staff dressed in similarly small outfits. I guess I make this comment for other girls that might think this is just a place for guys, I didn't think it was tacky in that way.  I would add this place to the list if I was looking for a chill sportbar."}
{"text":"Eh. Nothing great, nothing bas. Burger was flavorful but everything else was greasy and heavy."}
{"text":"I actually went here several months ago, and just realized I never reviewed it.  Nice beer selection, good decor and plenty of tv's for watching sports.  I was actually there on a random weeknight with a buddy and I could count the number of people on two hands.  It wasn't exactly hopping, but the service was great.  A couple of the waitresses actually sat down at our table and chatted for a while.  Can't complain..."}
{"text":"I love this TK. I used to work there until I transferred to the California location. The atmosphere is great and all the ladies there are fun, bubbly and err...hot. It's okay for kids, kind of. I wouldn't call it a family place, it's definitely more of a get hammered place. But overall, good people good times and a good place to go for some food! Try the gaelic chicken with mashed potatoes! It's the best :)"}
{"text":"New location just up from the older store from, larger location service great, food okay, new building is bright and very open, seems to be a better atmosphere. The tvs are plentiful, center bar, not sure why they didn't put the bar down both sides with center pour beer and kitchen end server station with small center floor station on both sides.  Experience Just slow on the start, greeted and sat then some lag to first greet by waitress, she was friendly and service was great! Just guess I need to take a breath and slow down. Slow times are when management should/could stop and check tables especially since this is a new location. I told the waitress the food was good the fish on my street tacos a little dry, not her fault. Overall good experience. Should I continue probably not this visit was less of an experience than an endurance not so far as a new place that should be an experience-not so much!if the owner had any sense about himself he'd call me!"}
{"text":"Its sad that this establishment feels that they will go broke if they don't honor the Yelp check in offer that they set up. Trust me, the so called Irish nachos are gross and an offense to the Irish as a whole. I use to take my friends and clients here and ordered the nachos for them as an appetizer, Im such a bad friend, I know. Until one day the manager saw it fit to scold me infront of my guest and retract further use of the Yelp check in offer. Days later he banded me from the business because I called him out on his lack of digression. What an F tard. No where on the check in offer does it say thats its only valid for a one time use. I'll be contacting Kilt headquarter and Yelp regarding my experience with said F tard.   Real reviews, really."}
{"text":"Well if you are reading this review tonight and got someine under 21 with you i saved yiu sIme time as you can not enjoy the experience as its UFC fight night and 21 or older is the mode of operation for the night....and hooters next door may be am option but be prepared t ok wait as its packed and they also have UFC fight night to but kids are welcome...great way to let loose after a day of the races at PIR"}
{"text":"The service was pretty good, the bartender was ok. As I walked in, I noticed that it had a strange smell. I still don't know what that smell was, but it was odd. They have a pretty good happy hour and they also have a reverse happy hour, which is great if you missed the first one. Overall, place is ok. I had fun with my friends the drinks were good."}
{"text":"Its a big bar with tons of televisions, full of yelling fans and lots of beer on draft. We did not go nuts over the wings, just not the greatest, but about average. The waitresses were cute and super helpful. Great view from the second floor downtown. My only issue is that some of the long bar tables are two sided and some weird guy sat across from us and was staring at us and breathing on our food. Just a comment, maybe I won't sit there again but isn't it common courtesy to not do that? With a hundred open seats? And a narrow table with our food and drinks on it? HUH? Am I asking too much?"}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town, arrived late at  night and wanted to have a quick drink before heading to my hotel for the night. I decided to take a gamble on this place, probably would've had better luck at the casino across the street. The bartender was pleasant. I ordered a vodka soda and the garlic fries. As I went to take a sip I noticed that there was a fruit fly in my drink. The bartender apologized and made me another drink. I waited quite a bit for the fries so I was expecting them to be extremely hot, if only I was so lucky. They were warm border-line cold and saturated in oil.. Not worth the extra calories. I am giving this place 2 stars only because the bartender was pleasant and attentive otherwise I'd say skip it"}
{"text":"Stopped in here one cold, rainy December evening for a pint.  Ended up trying the Head Hunter IPA (Fat Head's Brewery, Middleburg Heights, OH) and an order of Nachos.  The IPA was pretty good IPA with aggressive notes of hops, pine, grapefruit, and citrus, with a nice, crisp, bitter finish.  The Nachos were rather ordinary.  Service was very good! And there is something about a woman in Tartan..."}
{"text":"AVOID at all costs. Had a below average experience here about a year ago, but it is right by the Hampton Inn I usually stay at and I was in the mood for some wings tonight so I walked over to give them another try. Mistake!   I walked in and the hostess didn't even greet me. She was talking to another employee so I walked on over to the bar since I was by myself. Sat at the bar and no one ever came over - not even the bartender who didn't seem all that engaged with anyone else around the bar. The bar as well as the entire restaurant was not that busy. Certainly not too busy to at least greet someone and take a drink order or acknowledge my existence.   After being ignored for over 10 minutes I got up to leave. As I walked out, the hostess who was now talking to another employee simply said \"well, have a good night.\"  I went over to Longhorn and enjoyed a steak and great service from Hakim, a very attentive bartender.  Thanks, Tilted Kilt. Your poor, ahem, lack of service did allow me to have a great night... Elsewhere."}
{"text":"Environment: 6.5  Food: 2  Food quality 2 Service: 1  This place sucks. I went with a couple of friends to try this place out since it was nearby and we've always passed by it but never actually went inside. My first impression of the bar when I walked in was it was very spacious, with alot of televisions. It sort of reminded me of Real Sports Bar with the huge TV in the middle ( but no comparison to RSB anyhow)   After we got our seats, and decided what we wanted to drink and eat which didn't take very long, the waitress that was suppose to be serving us didn't even bother coming over to check up on us or take our order after a good 20 mins. Also when she did finally come by, she looked utterly bored and dis interested in even serving us.   When finally our drinks and food came, we didn't have utensils or any plates, so we asked our waitress to give us some, and which that took another 15 mins for her actually give us everything. The nacho's we ordered weren't even good. It was cold and it just tasted like it was like left overs.   When we decided that we had enough and were ready to leave, we had gotten the bill and placed down our money and were waiting to get change. And again, our waitress never came by to see if we were ready to pay and take our money. We saw her sitting down at another table with other customers chatting away and clearly not caring about her duties or responsibilities. I felt that she was very unprofessional and lacked the courtesy towards us but showed interest to other customers instead.   Definitely would not come back here. The customer service and food is really disappointing."}
{"text":"Irish version of Hooters?  I guess this is the type of place people will go to see young college girls in skimpy clothes, not necessarily for the food. I went here after a baseball game to grab some food and some beer. We ordered their wings and garlic fries to share. The wings were just horrible. We asked for a mixture of their hot sauce and their sweet and spicy sauce and grilled. The waitress totally commended us for that decision and said it was sooo good. And it wasn't. It was TERRIBLE. The wings were so greasy and the sauce was incredibly lackluster. We left most of them on the plate and believe me, that NEVER happens with me and  food.  The garlic fries....meh. I really think they could use some more garlic but maybe that is just my personal preference.   As far as the service, the girls were very friendly. But when our food was set down, they did not bring two little plates and we were missing silver ware. We kept trying to grab someone's attention and it took forever. When we needed our check, our waitress was nowhere to be seen.   Some of their beer cocktails looked pretty interesting. So now I know that this place is mainly for drinking and I will only go again if the people I am with want to go there for the novelty.   The view of downtown from the second story is very nice!"}
{"text":"Went here because the sunday paper had a free appetizer.. I can see why it is free.  Typical type of bar. Food is Meh, drinks are...drinks. and the girls are scantily clad. If you like mainstream places like this go for it.   Not my cup of tea.."}
{"text":"Lame, lame, lame.  Its in the same realm as Barley House.  If your looking for an Irish place..keep moving.  Kilts are Scottish btw...  Unoriginal food.  Slow service and expensive.  If they at least had good wings I would of gave it more stars!  The only reason I gave them another star is they have a whole section devoted to the POGUES above the bar.  They have a soft spot in my drunken, shriveled heart..  This place is good for horny, middle aged creeps who struck out at the casino.  Others, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good time here. The food wasn't too bad. Had the nachos and liked it as well as the brownies for dessert. The waitresses are very sexy looking like very naughty school girls. I could see up their short kilts every time they bent forward or some were just wearing their kilts very very short so I just sat back enjoyed the view :). I like the the size of the restaurant. Ill be back for sure probably to catch a game."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Tilted Kilt; it will likely be my last.  Appetizer:  we ordered the chips and salsa. Simple enough, right?  Wrong!  It was tasteless, bland, certainly underseasoned, and had an odd after taste.  Entree:  black bean burger.  As ubiquitous as the veggie burger is, I was hoping this would at least be AS good as the others I've had.  The patty had a chalky taste, the bun fell apart in my hands, and the avocado wasn't very ripe.  Pickle spears were warm (who wants a warm pickle-lol).  The garlic fries were pretty good.  The service was fine--our server was nice.  The drink I ordered was very good--the only bright spot in this experience.  Needless to say, I was less than satisfied with my food and won't recommend any of TK locations.  It just was good at all."}
{"text":"So ya' want: Food. Beer. Boobs and Sports huh? Like most who try to \"do it all\", this place excels at NONE.  If you want great food go to Cibo. If you want great beer go to the Roosevelt Tavern or Lost Leaf. If you want great boobs go to the Hi Liter. If you want great sports go to Coach & Willies.  (all of those are within a few blocks of this place)  If you want all of 'em in one great spot ... good luck to ya' champ."}
{"text":"Went back again last night. This place is downtown Toronto and they ran out of Heineken??? Seriously? Besides that, the service is horrendous. Actually waited 50 mins to get a beer after asking the waitress 3 times. Short kilts, open shirts, crappie service. Avoid this place. Just go next door to the Bier Market."}
{"text":"The food was good and the ladies were nice. The atmosphere was fairly standard but clean which is a big deal for my stars. The simple reason because this pub did not get a 5 star review is because my 12.00 dollar Guinness tasted watered down. I probably won't go back, mostly because in this area there are so many options and I like trying new things."}
{"text":"The venue was good, almost as good as Twin Peaks, and the beers were varied and plentiful, but the wait staff suck. They were semi-attentive, but boring and perform their jobs as if they were a routine. We normally tip really well. I gave them 5 bucks. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Just had one of the most awesome burgers ever!  A bit crowded because of college football but still getting great service. Waitress let us know she would be with us in a minute and she was. Beer selection is great and cold. Love the 'rail', feels like sitting at the bar, but faces the big TVs instead. Well be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the boneless BBQ wings and they were disgusting. They were so chewy it was like I was eating calamari..very little sauce on it..pretty sad meal..the tater tots were obviously fried and tasted like oil..the service was OK..we were told even before walking in the coors lights were $3 and after we sit down and order it was $7..just disappointed and spent $90 on shitty food."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs!  Terrible incompetent service!  I decided to try this place out for a late lunch, as I've been to the downtown Toronto location and had a good experience.  I ordered the grilled herbed chicken entrée.  Simple enough, right?  Apparently not.  The waitress returned later with a chicken sandwich.  I explained that wasn't what I ordered, and re-requested the grilled herbed chicken entrée.  20 minutes later I was given the chicken fried chicken entrée.  Not once, but TWICE they got it wrong?  Is it really that difficult to get an order right?  Apparently it is at the Tilted Kilt.  After wasting 40 minutes of my time, and very hungry, I cut my losses and went to Moxie's instead, where the waitstaff have brains as well as beauty.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The waitress had no clue what we were asking about on their menu, nor did she know about the drinks at all. The patio was nice. The kids meal satisfied our daughter but our food was totally overcooked and cold when it arrived."}
{"text":"Is it comparable to hooters? Well, yes and no. The food blows hooters away, but they also have very different food. Hooters is burgers and wings and fries, while Tilted Kilt is more of, a regular dinner place, just with half naked ladies.   I've gone back multiple times. Kinda pricey but worth it! I've yet to be disappointed with anything I've tried, and I'm a pretty picky eater. Just wish they had cheaper drinks.  *update* Lowering my review to 3 stars. Had tap beer a few times here (to be sure) and it was atrocious. Not sure if they have dirty tap lines or what, but multiple beers tasted very very bad. I haven't been back."}
{"text":"Game Night, Suns v T'Wolves.  but its amateur night at the bar.  This place hires all the bar-tending class failures (is that even possible?).   I had to double check and made sure I'm not wearing my Army Camo's cuz it felt like they could not see me.    finally got a drink with lingering empty glass, not once I had a drink check, ordered a shot for my buddy that required several reminding's.  On top of that I was handed somebody else's bill.  WOW!  I don't think this place deserve any Stars.  Snap!! I just realize that I too, as a man would be dis grunted if I have to wear a skirt to make living."}
{"text":"July 26 4:00 I walked in to the bar to be and I was given the impression that I wasn't welcome to sit down on the left side of the bar. A Caucasian server working on the left side of bar made me feel very   Not welcomed. She said \"I was sitting on the wrong side of the river\" is that a racist remark???  I then went to the bar area and sat down to be treated the  exact same way by a a server with a ugly skowl look on her face! She has the ugliest hideously looking eyebrows in the entire restaurant! Never going back.  I sound mad for a reason."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for happy hour around 3 and sat at the bar.  It want very busy.  After about five minutes without being recognized, we flagged down a bartender ask for a drink menu, then after a few more minutes flag down the server to order drinks.  I ordered their Monday Moscow mule special.  It was basically ginger beer and water.  My wife had a well margarita which was awfully sweet; she decided not to finish it.  I understand we went in for happy hour but the service and drinks were terrible.  Won't be going back during our stay here.  Shame because it's right outside our hotel."}
{"text":"came here with about 10 people after a blue jays game. we were hungry and wanted to just grab a bite while watching nba.  our waitress was very friendly and our drinks were served promptly, but the food took forever. and it was super disgusting. almost every single dish was overcooked, super dry, tasteless, greasy, cheap with ingredients... ugh seriously just crap food. i felt like crap eating it and had to leave half of it. the only nice thing was the atmosphere and TV. it was lively and there was a big 3x3 TV screens so we could enjoy watching the game. but overall, the food was just so terrible. won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Superbowl, friends, burgers and hot girls!! what else do i need to say?"}
{"text":"Decent lunch at reasonable prices. Fish tacos were good. Fish was well flavored and rightly grilled. Came with chips and salsa which tasted very average. My friends had wraps and sandwiches which seemed good and came with yummy sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"So what started as an awful experience was remedied by a good waitress (Natalie) and the manager. Still, the place has a lot of kinks to work out. We were promptly seated by a wonderful hostess, where we waited for about 15 minutes before we asked our hostess if there was a waitress in our section. We hadn't been greeted or waters or anything. She quickly got us our server who explained they were having some issues, but quickly owned the situation and offered us a round of drinks on the house. Nicely done. The manager also came by to make sure we got some drinks. We got the food which was just fine. We had a Reuben and the Gaelic chicken. They messed up and gave us pasta instead of the mashed potatoes we requested. Didn't have the heart to tell our server since she had already tried so hard to make things right. She was a blast to talk to, and really she made the experience fun. Overall, I might stop by again... But the staff was what stood out more than the food!"}
{"text":"Ok. So now I have been to the major 3 eateries that have waitresses in skimpy attire and TVs tuned to sports channels. Like the food, I won't remember this place in a day or so. Our waitress was pleasant at least, but the ambience in general reminded me of a strip club without the music, poles and stages. Some waitresses seem to pick (maybe regular) customers (i.e. men) to sit with and chat it up. Ours didn't sit with us. It happened at another similar restaurant. Is this some sort of 'lap dance' without the actual dance. Guess I am jealous. But the food is nothing to write about."}
{"text":"Dropped in with a friend on a Friday night and it was D-E-A-D.....that's never a good sign but we figured oh well, we're here so might as well stay.  We grab a table and a waitress comes over pretty quickly to get our order.  My friend was hungry so we asked about food but she informed us that the kitchen closed at midnight, it was about 12:08.  That was annoying because I just feel like if your establishment is open until 2:00 you should have the WHOLE thing open until 2:00am.  So once that was discovered we decided we were just gonna finish our drinks and look for somewhere that did serve food.  Unfortunately at this point our waitress had vanished.  We were looking around the whole bar (which again, was 90% empty) and couldn't find her anywhere.  After a while I finally spot her and made some serious eye contact until she figured out that we needed her.  The whole stop there felt like a waste of time and was accompanied by service that, while friendly, wasn't present when we needed it."}
{"text":"At Tilted Kilt where they aren't ready AT ALL for opening day kickoff!!! REALLY??? Didn't \"officially' open until 10 which is kickoff. Didn't even know what games would be on the individual TVs!!! PATHETIC!!!"}
{"text":"Cold fries, raw chicken and bacon left off my salad. And terrible slow service! Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Amped up Scottish Hooters? Maybe that's not fair....Hooters is tired and so yesterday while Tilted Kilt is fun, busy and inviting.   Still on a high from enjoying a concert across the street at US Airways, we were ready to do some drinking. Found our way upstairs to the Tilted Kilt and sat at the long bar table. The waitresses are really nice and it seemed to be a tag team effort going on to keep the customers happy and their drinks full.  We were more interested in drinking than eating but appetizers were ordered (gotta soak up some of the alcohol!!). Three of us had pretzels and they came out hot, fresh and delicious. But the beer cheese. Ugh, the beer cheese. None of us cared for it. When a waiter was removing our dishes, he noticed one plate was practically untouched. He asked if it was unsatisfactory and the reply from K was that she didn't like the cheese. The waiter quietly told us he didn't either and then asked if he could bring out some nacho cheese. Much better choice for K but of the two kinds of cheese, 3 of us thought the beer cheese was better...and we didn't even really like that. A spinach artichoke dip and chips was ordered by M and it was quite good. In fact, we all helped her finish it off.  Service is great at TK and the prices fair. In fact, I was surprised at the price of our shots - very reasonable, especially the Don Julio Blanco (my fav).   Good times!"}
{"text":"Located in the Linq on the Famous LAs Vegas Strip. Great food at great prices, an unreal happy hour, and scantly clad waitress (thats for those of you who don't care about Great food at great prices,and an unreal happy hour). This is a great place to stop in have a touch of the creature and take a break from shopping or walking the strip. Don't forget to join their email club for great offers! Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. I had the fish and chips, they were authentic.  My wife had the nachos which she liked, but they did forget to put the chicken and sour creme on them, which she had to ask for. The service was lacking, our server seemed pre-occupied with other things and not providing adequate service. But that all said not bad for a place to stop and get a quick bite. Would have given 4 stars if not for the service provided."}
{"text":"Went with three friends, for two of us, the food was cold, manager was nice about it, most likely not returning."}
{"text":"Calico Jacks was much better than this place.  The food here is terrible- only thing they have going for them is the waitresses.  Over priced and i am not a fan"}
{"text":"We visited many restaurants during our trip to Toronto and for the most part was successful in our quest to find delicious food. Unfortunately, Tilted Kilt was not of them. It was the only restaurant that we were not satisfied with. I do want to acknowledge that my friend and I did venture to this place without reviewing the Yelp reviews. It was a mistake on our part, but we were hungry and the Old Spaghetti Factory next door was not open  Dishes ordered:   - BBQ Pork Sandwich with vegetables as a side (2.5/5) - a decent sandwich that does the trick. However, there was way too much seasoning in the pulled pork which made it salty for the palate. The vegetables were not steamed, but seasoned with the same spices of the pulled pork. This made the vegetables unable to eat and defeated the purpose of trying to eat some veggies for the sake of being healthy  Setting - the ambiance here is not pleasant. The servers look skimpy, unhappy, and unprofessional. For instance, when we were ready to pay, we asked for the tab and our waitress said \"oh, hell yeah.\" She then apologized and that became awkward. Overall, the setting is just interesting...   My final remarks are I did not really enjoy my time at this establishment and think with improvements, it could improve on both its operations and service"}
{"text":"I got the fish and chips and it was a bit soggy. Fries were good though. Service was just so-so, giving the three stars."}
{"text":"The girls have nice boobs and so on but no personality . Not friendly.. Cold reception ..."}
{"text":"Full bar, good burgers, and cleavage.  What more can you want?"}
{"text":"Kaylee and Bobby both provide stellar services at the bar. I saw both of them handle the drink orders for a busy bar and for the entire place. Seeing them work make me feel motivated to come for NFL Sundays and make it a ritual for the season. Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Luv this place, pretty much come here every time we are in Vegas. Good times, good brews, and great bar food~"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how I feel about this place. It has its good points and its bad points.   The back, smoking patio is great for watching all the crazy people come and go from Wal-Mart in a rush, but the waitresses tend to forget you back there. They allow cigar smoking, but the heaters they have are the worst and only warm the crown of your head. The food is just okay, but the drink prices can be really good on happy hour. Husband and his buddy came here a few times for a scotch and cigar on the patio because they had a nice glass of 15 year for $7.00. They came back for that scotch a few times because it was such a great deal, in fact. The last time they went, the price was suddenly $11.00. We spoke with the manager who gave us each a $5.00 gift certificate for our troubles, which was nice, but he said that the price is $10.00, plus another buck for ice. Oh well.   A different time, I decided to have a glass of Frangelico while the dudes sipped on their scotch. The waitress had no clue what I was talking about and said they probably didn't have it. Oh, girl please. She finally came back with my drink and I sipped. It didn't taste right so I asked if they were sure this was Frangelico? She double checked, and yes. Long story short, I watched a second glass be poured right out of the bottle and it still tasted wrong, even without the ice. I told the bartender that I don't want a drink when the bottle's been watered down, so I left both glasses. I don't know if they water down any of their other bottles, but I think I'll stick to bottled beers if I'm ever dragged here again."}
{"text":"Terrible! Route we sat for over 25 with no one coming to our table. Servers walking by putting silverware on the table. We got up to leave and I told the manager on duty we are leaving because we waited and couldn't get service, she responded \"ok\" and turned away. Great guest recovery skills!"}
{"text":"Hit here for a quick lunch, and was suprised to have no WiFi with which to work.    This was my first visit to a Tilted Kilt, and although the outfits met my expectations, the waitresses definitely did not.  They were very attentive, and good at their job but lacked in the looks department.    I ordered the Irish Dip (French Dip) but found that there was almost no meat on the sandwhich, and not enough juice to dunk the hard roll into.    The Guiness was cold and rich, and the ambiance was cool, but just didn't quite live up.  Beers were expensive too for being out of the city.    Worth a try if you like a girl in a kilt....  otherwise....head somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here.  Kristen the bartender waited on me right away.  She was very friendly and on top of her game.  It was a full bar, very busy.  A server even said hi to me.  It was a very welcoming place to get a few drinks.  Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and was not disappointed. Their burgers are wonderful. They have homemade chips that are to die for!  Customer service was a little slow, but still nice. Definitely worth going back to!"}
{"text":"This is not my first time here, so imagine my disappointment when the service sucked this time.  Sad part is that i have family from out of town with me.  Our waitress first off got the beers mixed up, OK things happen, next did not really listen to what we ordered.  My niece ordered BBQ sauce instead of ranch and mandarin oranges instead of fries and when the food came out she got ranch and fries, when the check came we got charged for the waitress' mistake.  I ordered chicken wings with blue cheese and guess what i received ranch dressing, on the ticket i was charged for that also.   I was also kind of surprised that for the price of wings you only get 8.  The parking sucked on top of all this.  I was so embarrassed that i brought my out of town guest to this place and after watching Undercover Boss, very sad.  The owner might want to check out this place himself.  It will be a long time before i go back myself or take anyone else there."}
{"text":"Pretty typical for The Tilted Kilt. Nothing special. We only came here because we are staying at The Linq, and it was close by and the least crowded. It was actually pretty dead.   We were seated right away. The host were standard. Not super friendly and energetic like we prefer. They kind of just went through the motions, but at least they smiled.  Our server was nice, but pretty mono tone like the host. The restaurant was pretty slow, so they were probably just bored lol. Anywho, we ordered the Nachos, and pre game pickles. We only got the pickles because they were free if you add your email to their email list. I'm glad we got the pickles though because they tasted pretty good. The nachos tasted like pure grease, and the meat on them was blah. For our entrees we order a half rack of ribs, kids mac n cheese & the fish N chips. I didn't see ONE salad option on the menu, which was disappointing. I mentioned that to my husband later, and he said he did see 1 salad, but only 1, so it was probably a plain house salad. Anywho, back to the food. My husband really enjoyed his ribs. He said the sauce was great, and that the half rack was plenty. The kids mac n cheese was a great size. My fish N Chips was disappointing since I was really craving a tasty flavorful batter around some fish, but the batter tasted like the nacho chips, just like grease. It didn't have any flavor, no seasoning, salt, nothing. Grease.  I must say the red Sangria was fantastic. I am not much of a drinker, so many times I end up leaving most of my drinks pretty full because the alcohol is just yuck to me. Nope, not today. It was sooooo good. I was giving 3 stars, but decided to make it 4 only because the Red Sangria was great.  They have some fun games, Foosball, shuffleboard, some electronic games (darts or golf I think), and our favorite CORN HOLE!  Pretty standard overall. Nothing special. The Long Beach location is better."}
{"text":"YAY!  Tilted Kilt in Matthews.  I think if you take the place for what it is, it's great but if you are expecting something else you won't have such a good time here.  Went here for drinks and dinner with a buddy and we were warmly greeted by the hostess and then lead around the restaurant.  She had our best interest in mind since we really didn't care where we sat, but I think one of the girls was going to sit us at a bench high top with another large group of people and the other girl thought otherwise and sat us at a nice 6 person table instead.  As we were sitting down, the girl asked us if we were still in school/college and we were very flattered since we are about 8 years out of college at this point - but we will take anything we can get. ;)  Our server, Asia... was nice and attentive.  You could tell she just started working there since she hadn't really gotten the routine yet - after she got our drinks, she sat at our table and chatted with us and asked us for our IDs.... and then asked for our drink orders again (but corrected herself).    For a Thursday night, this place was pretty packed watching college games, UFC fight, or various other sports on all the TVs that surround the entire restaurant.  We ordered food - I ordered the Irish Cheese steak and it was gi-normous.  The onion rings I \"upgraded\" my fries from were worth it.  Light on the batter and nice and crispy.  I'd say this is a solid place to get a drink with good pub food.  I wouldn't go in here if you are expecting excellent food and white table cloth service.  The girls are nice and their uniforms are revealing.  A little less \"I like the wings at Hooters\" and more \"I want Britney Spears to serve me Irish food\".  So yes, it's fun just to watch the waitstaff in action.  I can see where some ladies might get the wrong impression since it is advertised as a Pub & Eatery, but it is a pretty large chain so people should figure it out pretty quickly.  All the gimmicks aside.  I think it's great that Matthew's has this option as a restaurant, but the businesses around Independence have been rather hard to keep unless you are a super big restaurant chain."}
{"text":"This place is all about objectification of women.  The uniforms welcome using your male gaze on the wait staff.  Now, don't get me wrong - people normally know that going in.  That's not what my review is based on.  The burger was the driest, worst, burger I've ever had.  It's literally the worst hamburger I've ever had in my life.  So that's terrible.  Now, add to that that they served my friend beer three times, and didn't know what the beer was they gave him.  He asked for one, they said they brought it, but it turns out later they didn't.  Then it turned out they didn't have any of the two types they said they brought him.  I don't know what nonsense this was.  But then his collectible mini pitcher was taken away by the waitress, and when he asked about it she said he couldn't keep it, until other waitresses came over and corrected her.  All in all - this place was awful."}
{"text":"I don't like places like this. That's totally my perogative. Bobby!   Anyways. Dude so my sister used to work at Hooters and this is the same bar with a Scottish makeover.   The drink specials are not very special and the servers have been a bit rude every time I've veen in.   But if you like cheap bar food with girls in skimpy clothing... Hey oh! This is the place for you homie!"}
{"text":"The service is brutal, the food is way below average and their tap beer selection is less than stellar.  The best part of the bar is the map painted on the ceiling above the bar.  Seriously, not worth wasting your time."}
{"text":"This place is gross.   I've been here an unfortunate two times while visiting the LINQ. The first time I went with a few girlfriends to grab dinner and drinks. The food took a long time to come out (over 45 minutes) and when it finally did, the wings I ordered were cold. I let the server know and she took the wings back. I think they popped the entire thing in the microwave because it came out looking the same and luke warm instead of cold. I wasn't happy about it and they were accommodating enough to take it off of our bill. I was still hungry but had no desire to order something else off of their menu.  The second time I sat at the bar for drinks. I went with a few others and we each ordered a beer right away. It was super odd because after we ordered, the bartender said he closed us out and gave us all our individual bills. Like he was worried we wouldn't pay? Usually a bartender would ask if we want to start a tab or close out and pay for the drink. I don't know why this annoyed me but it did. I also literally watched a cockroach scurry across the floor which was incredibly disturbing and speaks volume on the cleanliness of the restaurant.  I will not be back. Not sure why I even went back after the first time. It's conveniently located if you want to bar hop at the LINQ but I definitely think you should find elsewhere. Try Yardhouse over by the high roller."}
{"text":"I'm never going back. My girlfriend and I went there instead of our usual spot Zipps. Two waitresses served us. They asked for our order. I didn't think I wanted a drink so I declined my girlfriend had not decided on a drink. While waiting for our food she knew exactly what she wanted to order. They waitresses never came back. They came back with our food. The one asked do you want a drink. Our thoughts the food is now here so no. Lol. So we drank the waters. My girlfriend then orders a dessert. She asked if I wanted more water I said yes please never got the water. They bring the dessert. Still no water but the dog at another table got his water. As a dog lover I understood. One says oops we never brought the water. We both eat the dessert. They bring us the check still no water as they said they had been cut for the evening from management. We paid the tab. Still even after eating it all I drank the two sips from my girlfriends water. Then we left. No tip, which I felt bad about. I've never done that. But I went to the near by QT and brought a bottled water. Never again will we make that mistake. Zipps continues to win in our house."}
{"text":"Nice place to watch a game.  The scenery isn't bad either."}
{"text":"I actually love the chain, been to a few multiple times in Denver & Phoenix, so I was sooo stoked when I found out Vegas was going to open a location. Unfortunately, I've visit this one multiple times, (for the delicious food, which the food is still consistently good), & EVERY SINGLE TIME the service is INSANELY bad!! As if the waitresses/servers were never tried, seriously. You'll be sitting waiting on them instead & only for them to be unfriendly & careless. Don't tips pay bills?"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday before a Suns game.  Got seated outside and waited 15 minutes.  No one took our drink order so we left.  Way better options around the arena."}
{"text":"I would give this place 1 star, but the view was worth another two.  2+1=3?  So the food was typical bar fare. Typical sandwiches typical drinks.  The service was lacking in just the basics.  Want silverware and napkins with your meal.  You gotta ask for it.  Want ketchup?  You have to ask.  Want someone to stop by and ask how your meal was? You have to go get the manager.  The girls serving were smokin' hot.  Incredibly cute and young.  Hot little skirts and outfits.  I guess you cant get good service and a view.  Why is that?"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has three stars because we just went in for the first time and had a fabulous time.  Sara B was our server and she was absolutely wonderful.   I had the chicken tacos and they were very tasty. There's a ton of TVs seems I could be a great place to watch a game I will be back"}
{"text":"Service a tad slow Saturday afternoon we left tall round table to booth...bar server was very nice and the Fried Pickle Spears were SO addictive!  Beer selection ok...did the Grapefruit Sculpin (in the lame goblet)."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a Cavs game for a quick beer. Beer was warm, service was sub-par and the scenery wasn't anything to brag about. Needless to say I probably will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The chicken here is good. Staff are attendant and the atmosphere is exciting. Again, very pretty waitresses."}
{"text":"Hooters has nothing on the Tilted Kilt, except maybe San Diego. Suzie (the bartender) was pleasant and quick to get my order. I walked in when it opened and you can tell she had to do the prep for the day and she handled it like a champ.  I had the TK's Signature Wings - Kilt Burner Sauce, which wasn't that hot. I was expecting an explosion of burning goodness. They were still delectable, but I wanted HOT!!   Anyway, the view of Suzie was absolutely easy on the eyes. She is absolutely gorgeous! I would go back just to have her service. :-)  A great beer selection on tap also made this a good spot to eat lunch/ drink lunch."}
{"text":"Nina was a fantastic barista who provided excellent service.  Decent beer selection although the food leaves something to be desired"}
{"text":"We went on a UFC night so the place was pretty packed but it took longer to find a parking space than to be seated (10 minutes). Our waitress was kind of cute but not very good, we are hoping that she was just new. She didn't know any of the beers on tap and didn't get us a drink menu. Our replacement beers and extra sauce took FOREVER and she almost never checked up on us! But the atmosphere and the food made up for it. i had the fish and chips which were very respectable, the give u 3 fish fillets and a whole basket of fries. Will def go back."}
{"text":"This was my first time in a Tilted Kilt and I was excited about trying it out. Our server was very friendly.  Our food took a while to come, and when it did finally come, only part of our table got their food.  The rest came about 10 minutes later.  The food was all right, nothing special, and a bit over-priced.  Several friends ordered spicy burgers or wraps and it was not spicy at all.  I don't know that I would go back, especially with so many other choices in Vegas."}
{"text":"Well...I would not recommend the Tilted Kilt as a place to eat. As a pub it is average but with a twist since the waitresses are scantily clad. If the girls could serve with personality it could almost make up for the below average food. Unfortunately a short skirt and tiny tied up shirt cannot compensate. My business partners and I ordered simple dishes - Irish Stew, Smoked Meat Sandwich and a Beef Dip. I had the dip and it was one of the worst I have ever had. The waitress forgot our dips and brought them half way thru the meal. There was not quality check either. I had a coffee but they ran out of cream so they brought whipping cream which was odd.  The manager was great since she ended up comping one of the meals and discounted the other 2 meals.  The Tilted Kilt is probably great to watch a game with the boys but definitely not a date place.  Check it out"}
{"text":"We arrived in party of 8 and only had to wait 5 minutes on a busy night. The servers did a good job bringing drinks and the food was also tasty.  I would recommend you remind your servers to check ids before serving alcohol to some who looks 18. i could not believe our server just asked \"Are you old enough to drink to some who looked 18\".  Maybe that is it is in Vegas. :("}
{"text":"i'ts hard to give a place where you see a lot of boob a bad review, but i have to.  the food is pretty crappy.  some english & irish beer on tap, but i'm not a huge fan of those.  it's all mainstream stuff you can find at safeway.  i guess not a bad place to get a beer and watch a game if there's no other choice and you have't seen 1/2 a boob in 6 months.  but i wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"We just had our worst experience at this or any tilted kilt ever. This one is located on Warner and priest. We were greeted by a hostess with an attitude who sat us in what was later to be known as the black hole. We sat for approximately 15 minutes with no one coming to our table. We had tons of waitresses pass us and a few who stopped to talk to each other by our table but no one ever asked us one question. An older couple was sat at the table next to us and were waited about 3 minutes of being seated. That's when I decided to leave. I found the manager and explained why I was upset and leaving. I turned down a free lunch because that was not my intention, to get a free meal. I wanted Him to be aware of what his staff was not doing. It will be some time before I return here"}
{"text":"Good location but no outdoor patio area which would have been nice. Wanted a Guinness and burger but the draft beer was undrinkable.Had a metallic rusty aftertaste which might be from the long lines running to the kegs which are typically never cleaned and serviced or simply too many beers on tap which causes problems. In any case I ended up having a coke and burger instead. Blue Cheese burger was good (how hard is it to make a burger?). I would say skip this run of the mill experience for more interesting eateries on the Linq."}
{"text":"There is only one reason I go here every time I visit Phoenix--- Shannon, the bartender.  She just may be the prettiest woman in Az.  I am a wing eater---- the Kilt sells wings for $11 a pound and there are 7 to 9 wings in a pound-- which means you could well pay $11 for 7 wings or $22 for 14 or 15 wings------ Saturday is the last time I will ever order wings here again--- and I say again-- Shannon, and the other beautiful ladies are the only reason to come here."}
{"text":"Love this place we went and watched college football and had food and drinks. Had tv's every where and the girls in school girl out fits were  easy on the eyes and nice. Food was really good as well."}
{"text":"Adjust your expectations and you will have a good time, the service and prices were decent, the wings were OK. The girls uniforms are a bit \"Hooters\"-y, which looks good after a few beers. They have live music on weekend nights. However you have many sports bar choices within a short walking distance in that area, so Tilted Kilt can only increase their market share by continuous improvement..."}
{"text":"Hot chicks and stiff drinks. An outside bar where you can smoke. What could be bad about this?   The service sucks.   For the second time in 3 weeks I went in with a buddy and could not get anyone to serve us. We flagged one one of the many waitresses and asked for a menu. We never were asked for an order. For the 2 beers we did get we had to go to the bar and get them our selves.   Sunday morning I talked to a friend who had been in Wednesday night and got the same type of treatment. This place does not deserve your business, especially at $6. a pint."}
{"text":"The Tilted Kilt 2 E. Jefferson Phoenix, AZ Assorted Locations in the Phoenix area and other states  The Tilted Kilt is one of those gregarious sports bars that tries to emulate a pub in some ways and yet be a sports bar in other ways. Somehow, they are successful. The décor is that of a typical sports bar with televisions hung all over the place, and, at least at the beginning of the lunch shift had music blasting so loud that one could not hear one's self much less even hear a cell phone ring.   This location is upstairs, and the elevator (important for those who are handicapped) hasn't worked since opening day.   Upon entering, I was greeted and seated promptly at the table of my choosing. Companion had not arrived yet, and I ordered Irish Nacho's ($6.99) to help pass the time. This was unique! Instead of typical tortilla chips, this was served on thick, slices of potato, fried to a golden brown and beautiful crunch. The spice and mild heat, instead of typically being in the cheese, was instead in the meat making for a nice surprise, and the dish was garnished with fresh tomato concassé.  Perhaps the only problem with this dish is that like the famous potato chip in a bag, you can't eat just one! You will eat until there is nothing but an empty basket left! Other appetizers available include classic nachos ($8.99), spinach and artichoke dip ($6.99) and Mozzarella Sticks ($7.99)  The last time I was at the Tilted Kilt I ordered the Shepherds' pie ($9.99) and found it to very good. Companion had the Gaelic Chicken ($11.99) and sent back a plate so clean that it could have been put back into stock accidentally. This time, I ordered the Irish Stew (a bargain @ $6.99). It arrived nice and hot as a moat around a pile of colcannon potatoes with cheese sprinkled on top. The meat was almost falling apart, and the taste was wonderfully savory. Many places like this will put lots of salt into the dish, but thankfully, the chef did not do that here, allowing the customer to salt and pepper the food to taste - a nice touch. The dish arrived with some nicely toasted garlic bread as an accompaniment.  Companion had the Pulled Pork sandwich, and was a bit disappointed. The meat was nicely done, and the brioche roll was an excellent choice to serve it on as it kept the contents in the sandwich instead of running down your hand, but the sauce was woefully short of promise. The sauce, which could have really made the sandwich special was nothing but an ordinary barbeque sauce that tasted like something off the grocery shelf. It lent no character to the dish, and in some ways took away from what would otherwise have been a nice sandwich. The pulled pork was crying for some smoky sauce perhaps with a touch of spice in it to bring the meal up to it's full potential. The sandwich was served with fries which were nicely done and not overly seasoned.  Other items available are Bleu cheese steak salad ($12.99), Huge burgers (10 oz. cooked to order (starting at $8.99), Fish and Chips ($10.99) and Fat Bastards Meatloaf Sandwich with Guiness sauce ($9.99).  For dessert, we shared a slice of cheesecake ($5.99). As with many places, the cheesecake tasted like it was brought in from an outside bakery, though in flavor it was quite nice. The disappointment was the whipped cream, or what some might think would pass for whipped cream. I was sure it was nothing more than the metal can with the squirt top that one buys in the local supermarket - light cream foamed up to make you think It's whipped cream. It had none of the denseness nor mouth feel of real whipped cream. Dessert would have been much better had they left it off the plate so as to not detract from the Cheesecake.  Over all, the service was attentive without being intrusive. Our waitress checked on our satisfaction several times, refilled drinks without being asked, and in general was quite helpful and nice. Our table was bussed promptly.   Sanitation was excellent with bathrooms almost having a homey feel to them and being well stocked and immaculately clean.  I rate this restaurant 4 stars based on quality of food, portion size to cost, and excellent sanitation."}
{"text":"4 of us arrived thinking this was the place we'd walked by that had wonderful smelling food. We asked for a table with  a 5th seat as one of our friends was stuck in traffic, we felt like the gal that seated us scoffed at us for asking for a table bigger than our party, it was a Friday night and although not too busy at the moment she told us that it'd be gettting busy after the Suns game. We sat down and chose our beverages, it's hard to get used to paying $7 for a glass of draft beer, they are $3 and $4 where i live. We also ordered water. We asked about the loaded , buffalo and chili tots, she told us they made their own sauce... we chose the buffalo and chili tots, and some wings to start with. The wings were mediocre, and dry. The Tots that did come were saturated in Franks Red Hot sauce with a few, and i mean few sprinkles of bleu cheese. Since they were so saturated they fell apart making them very difficult to eat, they really werent that good, but we were hungry and were paying for the meal. The Chili tots that were ordered came out as a bowl of tortilla chips and a small cast iron fry pan  with some good chili, it's a little sweet and that made it really tasty. About the only positive thing we can say about our experience. Although it wasn't what we ordered. The whole while we watched up to 5 girls screw around at the cash stand, not paying any attention to customers while we waited to have drinks refilled and eventually get our check..our friend that was with us kept commenting how his wife who has owned her own restaurant,  would have fired them on the spot....we are pretty sure we could have walked out without paying for our meal without them noticing,  while not the Right thing to do, we have to admit it was tempting due to the horrible meal and service we received. In addition to having to ask and then wait over 10 minutes for our check. We don't recommend this place to anyone.... YUCK! Terrible and Over Priced!! We had way better Fast Food later in the night as we hadnt eaten much of our dinner."}
{"text":"Great place to come watch the UFC Title Fights. No cover!   Excellent Kilt Burner Traditional Wings.   Fried pickles appeared to be hand battered and certainly hit the spot. Thick sliced crispy pickle chips.   Decently priced beers. Huss Scottsdale Blonde was $6 and there's plenty of handles to pick from.   Megan our server took great care of us on one busy night.  I'm under no impression this place isn't a fuckboy paradise, but I really wish Tilted Kilt would enforce their smoking area a little more.   We were trying to enjoy the patio and the smokers kept moving *out* of the designated, uncovered patio.   One even went as far as blowing his smoke right in my face.   Just rude and disgusting; one guy even dropped his cigarette by the door to the main indoor dining area and even after a manager told him to pick it up, fuckboy just left and management still didn't kick these degenerates out.   I'll be back, but only for UFC events."}
{"text":"The place is cool, the food is good, and the girls are pretty, but my only draw back is there is only one poorly lit pool table!!!!  One thing I have to say is it feels like a strip club, but without the nudity.  The girls are very nice and talk with you until you get the food, then they kind of hang out at the next table until they order, neglecting the previous table.  Sometimes it takes a while to get refills or whatever else you want after your meal has arrived."}
{"text":"I've been debating going to this place since it opened. I finally went today really not sure what to expect but went any way. I'm sure this place is for guys, I don't like the idea of seeing a woman's butt while I'm eating or period but to each his own. Any who I ordered my food to go, I got the club sandwich and Caesar side salad. I honestly was expecting it to be good at least because of the prices. I asked the girls that worked there about certain things on the menu and they hadn't had anything I asked about. So I took my chances, got my food home. And it really wasn't what I was expecting, the club was like a sandwich after thanksgiving I was expecting deli style any who the salad was less than average and my sweet tea tasted like the container that it was in, and to cover up that taste it's like they put a whole lot of sugar in it to make it super sweet. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Wow, this is an embarrassment of a bar. A person I stood beside in the washrooms said the following \"I think I just got an STD by entering this place.\"  The drinks are expensive, the service deplorable and the waitress outfits... seriously?  This is a Hooters on Percocet, tired, lazy and forgetful.  I drafted this review while in the bar, expecting to change my thoughts upon finalizing the review online.  Unfortunately I still feel bad about my experience there and the other reviews are all consistent.  No point in beating around the bush on this one!  Worst bar in Calgary. Sorry"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Springhill suites, so I ordered for hotel delivery.  It took 45 minutes when they said it would take 20.  The driver was held up because of a hotel guest not showing up at the pervious stop.  Not his fault so I don't blame him for being late.  However, when he picked up my food after the delay, no one checked to see if it was still warm before letting it leave the restaurant.  When the food arrived, I paid the drive an extra $2.00 tip on top of the 2.00 service charge and 18% gratuity.  (gas is expensive and 18% on 14.00 is not much)  my food was COLD.  Not room temp, but cold.  Practically inedible.  I called and they did not offer much except if I wanted to go over there, they would make me a new meal.  This was at 7:45 at night and I have meetings in the morning.   They blamed the diver and said he was new, however, he should have been trained better then.  They were nice on the phone, but should have credited me at least a portion of my meal.   This is a big chain, they should know better,"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Incompetent wait staff. Food was nothing to talk about. Definitely won't be back or recommend to anyone.   Here's a photo of the staff. During their shift."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I always enjoy my meal. However I do not like that the person I was with ordered the BBQ pulled pork but when it came out there was pretty much no BBQ sauce on it, she asked for more BBQ sauce and the waitress brought out a small little container of it.  At the end we get the bill and find out we were charged 50 cents for that small drop off BBQ sauce, this really irritates me. Also my chicken wrap I ordered the menu stated it was 10 bucks and on the bill they charged me 10.50 things like this is what makes me not return to restaurants.  I'm not going to argue 50 cents or here 1 dollar of over charging with my waitress. I just don't return cause I don't like nickel and diming your customers. I really despise being over charged or being charged for a couple extra drops of BBQ sauce when I order an item that is suppose to have BBQ sauce on it. If I ordered something like a plain burger then want it,  I get it is an extra topping but when I order a BBQ pulled pork sandwich I expect BBQ sauce on it. Also just an FYI they charge 1.50 extra to go from regular fries to garlic or sweet potatoe fries, but their regular fries are good."}
{"text":"This is just a run-of-the-mill pub. The food was average & so were the drinks. Place was pretty quiet for a Sunday nite. Service was good from our server \"Francesca\". She was sweet & lovely. Otherwise no real compliments of complaints except the size of the chicken bits. They were good tasting but a very small order for $14.99."}
{"text":"Tilted Kilt is what is it is. Its basically an Irish version of a hooters. Food is good - not great - but decent for sure. Ceaser wrap, burgers and fries are actually pretty good. Drinks are pretty strong but decently tasty. Tilted Kilt is exactly what you would expect from a place with half naked waitresses. So I'm giving it it 5 stars for being good at what it's trying to do. Its really not trashy like I think people think and even my wife loves the place for its drinks and food. Its a great place to go for St Patty's day or a chill hang out to get drinks for a while after work. Highly recommend for a fun restaurant search!!"}
{"text":"I will never return!   After being ignored for some time by at least five  employees who seemed more interested in chatting up their friends than working, we went across the lot to Quaker Steak & Lube.   The reason I gave them one star is that it's the only way to leave a comment. Though I suppose the decor was nice."}
{"text":"This place flat out sucks. To start off the waitress was awful. It was some of the worst service I've ever had. The fish and chips tasted nothing short of garbage. I've never had bad fish and chips until I went here. The fish was awful but I'll give it to them, they didn't mess up the fries, which it is damn near impossible to mess up fries. Don't even get me started on the mozzarella sticks.. I always eat my food but I couldn't stomach the garbage they were trying to feed us. If I could give this place a negative review i would but lucky for them I can only give a one star. I would rather never eat again than eat at this establishment."}
{"text":"This is usually our go to place for sports events since it's so close to home. Love the grilled wings here with the TK Signature sauce! Also, drinks are cheaper here than most bars. Would recommend for a quick bite or drinks with friends. They do an industry discount if you have proof. The patio seating is nice too!"}
{"text":"This location IS OPEN! I don't know why but so many people believe this location is closed. It is located on the corner of prospect and Ontario. A friend and I went here for lunch yesterday. He got a chicken wrap and I got chicken fingers. It seemed as quick as we ordered it came out. Food was fresh, hit and amazing! Place was clean and staff was friendly and quick with smiles on their faces. Sherwin employees get 10% off"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place just for the atmosphere.....and yes the ladies are nice looking too but it doesn't feel like a run down Hooters and the food is slightly better but I hardly ever eat here.  I did get the spicy wings last night and I can tell you that they are MUCH better than Hooters, we also got chips and salsa but I was not impressed by the salsa.  I met some friends last night for happy hour which happens every few weeks.  The specials aren't bad but we enjoy ourselves, service hasn't been poor yet for us.  I do notice that I never see the same girl twice except maybe the bartender.  I feel like they rotate the girls here like a strip club.  I am not complaining but if you get bad service that maybe the reason."}
{"text":"Well I am somewhat of a regular here but after tonight they may have lost me as a customer all together. I've never had such horrible service in my life than I did this evening, \"Danni\" was absolutely horrid.   Not only did I have to chase her down to place my order after 30 minutes, then she took it upon herself to change my order because she \"assumed\" I would want it this way. After waiting an additional 20 minutes to flag her down to get my bill she proceeded to serve another table, and sit down at one table to get their order. This was ridiculous!   #endrant"}
{"text":"After reading reviews my expectations weren't very high, and that thought was confirmed.  The only reason we ended up coming here was that Rivertowne was insane.   Although our server was very nice, she was pretty much non-existent the entire time.  We order two beers and waters with our food.  45 min later our food came out and we still didn't get our beers. The food runner corrected the situation for her, but it was irritating.   Food wasn't too bad.  Would have been nice if it didn't take 45 min to get to our table. I understand that they are busy before a game, but 45 min for 2 sandwiches.  That's excessive. We ended up being late for the game because we couldn't find our server. I ended up asking the bartender and she responded that she was so sorry, and that our server was new. That's ok, but if she's new where's the support to help her? Oh wait, I know. They (seemed like every manager) were standing and joking at the host stand. Are you serious? Here are all these servers and bartenders struggling to keep up and their managers are standing around chatting. If I worked there, I would be livid.  I will never go back here. I don't care if Rivertowne is bursting at the seams. I'll wait."}
{"text":"Been here before with friends to watch a U.S. match. Service was good then.  Came back with my wife tonight and waited at our table for over 10 min with no acknowledgement or response to a simple \"Excuse me.\" Upon our exit, my wife told the hostess our issue, who said nothing and shrugged.  I understand that Monday nights are typically busy, and although far from full, the place was not exactly empty either. However, indifference is something that is a choice in service. One that makes my choice in pubs easier."}
{"text":"I just stopped in late night for a quick beer once we arrived in the Phoenix area. It was 10pm and the place wasn't too busy. Was able to score a seat at the bar and was served quickly by the attentive bartender.  It was close to our hotel and arena/Chase FIeld so a nice spot to meet friends for pre-game drink. I cannot comment on the food as I did not try it but it seems like the typical pub menu (burgers/sandwiches)."}
{"text":"Had the most raw chicken ever. Looked fresh from the chicken. The server didn't have a clue when I showed her so I asked her to bring the manager over. The manager said he would make new chicken for me but I already lost my appetite. Told him I could get very sick with raw chicken coming out of your kitchen and he didn't agree. He took the chicken off the bill and offered to buy me another drink. I was still on the hook for my other two appetizers and two beers. Mind you this happened 1 year ago and I've never been back to eat there. I give it 2 stars just because the bar service is good with good beer but being served the raw chicken and the downplay of the seriousness of raw chicken has insured I never want to eat there again."}
{"text":"Alright....this is a chain.... so you get what you think you are gonna get.  They were only about 30 or 40 percent full on the Sunday afternoon we went there. Our waitress had too many tables.... inside where we were and outside.  So she was running her patootie off.... and seemed very hurried.  I blame management for overstreching her.  Huge gaps between her visits.  Some more bus boys to keep the drinks fresh and troubleshoot would have helped alot.  The food was good.  I had a burger that was tasty and perfect fries.  The ale was super.  Lots of drinks to choose from.  Ambience.  If you are into sports there are tons of TVs and blaring sports sounds. Not my cup of tea.... but then again .... the waitresses give you plenty of ....shall we say... other things to look at besides the lame sports offerings."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for her first taste of a Steelers game.  What a complete disappointment!!!  Standing room only.  People were packed 5 deep trying to buy a drink and there was ONE BARTENDER!!  We sat there and watched money walk out of the door because people got tired of waiting 30+ minutes to get a drink.  The bartender told us that they didn't expect a crowd.  Seriously?  Every other place we went to on the North side was well staffed. Ended up spending our money down the street at Burgertory."}
{"text":"This place was located right next to my hotel and I always see their ads so I was intrigued. It is a basic bar with pub food and pretty waitresses as far as the eye can see. Wasn't very hungry so I got the Bavarian Style Pretzel with Guiness Cheese dipping sauce. The pretzel felt store bought and the cheese tasted out of a jar. I wouldn't recommend the pretzels. I should have ordered burger, they looked amazing."}
{"text":"So I wud not recommend this place to anyone...just stay away...first time going here not by choice...my sister forced me...I walked into the door by the pools areas to a patron hands under one of the waitress skirt...yes the same one that the manager had to come and remove...she was stuck to that table like glue...sucks for business....waited for abt 10mins before one waddle her way over while 3 of them standing around  around the guys at the pools table area...oh get this...r they allowed to drink on the job? I get its a bar an thing but I  don't thing they shud be allowed to drink while working....yes saw 2 of them having shots with some guys....food was nothing to talk about....we had 2 kinds of wings won't recommend it...least to say we were not there for the food...we were there for the drinks...one of the drunken waitress spilled our double shots while walking over with it  and still brought it over half spilled...like really? Oh after  we order our drinks 15 mins later it didn't came...we had to ask another one to re order...meanwhile they are standing right by the pools table with the guys just idles.  I àm not sure wat really are the waitress there for...if it's just to entertain the male patrons mayb I am getting it wrong.  The manager wants this place to succeed he/she have to be more vigilant about wats going on with these girls...They have no respect for themselves...nor the business nor the patrons...a lady passed by and ask us how is everything I said ...oh ok! I wasn't gonna use my time there to let her know anything we experienced....I am not sure who is the owner of this place but it won't last...unless the behaviour of these girls change...and the 20%tips u guys automatically add to the machine is a rip off...as tips shud be only given if I was satisfy...I àm certainly going to report this the the consumer breau....nice place alot was spent into it I know for sure I knew what it looked like before too bad it's being allowed to go like this...oh on one of the walls have the word Allah inscribed on it....come on that shud be covered up already...gud luck to the owner."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I'm highly disappointed with this location. I ordered a chicken tender wrap to go... I sat at the bar for 40 minutes waiting for it. I was told it would be ready in no time. Then when the wrap finally got to me, it was missing togo silverware. My wrap was wrong when I finally got back to my room, go figure."}
{"text":"This place has always been pretty crappy, and not just this location. I've never been super impressed with service or the food. Lately though, the service has taken a huge turn for the worst. Would rather get fast food then suffer through coming here."}
{"text":"Came mid-day for drinks and apps after a hike in Papago Park. Got Irish nachos and was very pleased with them -- potatoes cut up like slightly thick chips and not just served as french fries like many Irish-like bars.   Our server was quite nice and brought out samples of different brews so we wouldn't feel stuck with something we might not like while trying something new. We didn't ask her to, she just did it. That was pretty cool.   While I do agree that the uniforms are somewhat cheesy, I think it's silly that people are complaining about them. The girls chose to work there, just as you chose to eat there. If you don't like it stay away from Hooters, Heart Attack Grill, the Grill Next Door and Tilted Kilt.  Now I was a bit irked by the price, however. Irish nachos and two pints came out to $19. Jebus."}
{"text":"Located inside the Linq Promenade. Great service. The hostess was nice and the server was very attentive. I came here to watch some March Madness and they had my game on the screen.  The food was good, and the portions were pretty big. Ordered some Blue Moon and had great conversation!"}
{"text":"I neglected to mention that ... very soon after I reviewed Tilted Kilt ... the GM contacted me directly and apologized for the underwhelming experience.  I do appreciate that this step was taken, and have been back there a few times - with no further issues.  Thank you, Tilted Kilt, for having the integrity and concern to respond ... unlike MANY other vendors."}
{"text":"They place has great service with great looking girls. They pretty much have bar food, everything tasted great and drinks were amazing.  Enough screens here to keep everyone satisfied."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here has been fantastic. Service, food, and employees courtesy are awesome. Other Downtown bars should send their employees there to observe. Kari was my bartender today. She is as good as it gets. Bartenders from Coach's corner should go there to learn how to serve their patrons !"}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite sports bar in downtown Phoenix!  You have to get over the girls in the skirts and tied shirts. Honestly, it's not that bad compared to what some women choose to wear when they go out anyway! Nice touch to make the male bussers wear kilts too :-)  The Tilted Kilt has a fantastic location, in Cityscape, above Arrogant Butcher and directly across the street from US Airways Center. They have the MOST tv's with ESPN, NFL Network and other access that I have ever seen, including a giant, projection screen.   Tilted Kilt boasts a full bar and good beer selection. I was thrilled to see they served Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy! Their food is typical sports bar fare: burgers, salads, sandwiches. But their entrees are a little more varied with salmon, shepherd's pie, fried chicken and more! I LOVED their fries that I got with the French Connection burger (au jus on the side please).   Parking at CityScape sucks. It's an underground garage with limited spaces and don't forget to validate your ticket or you could pay a lot of $$!! On game days/nights, I have seen them charge $10-20 just to park there, which sucks if you're not going to the game.   Can't wait to go back & try out the patio when the weather cools down!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great environment, amazing staff and excellent service! The food came out in a reasonable time which is a HUGE plus for me. Plus the waitress Brea was super friendly and sociable with our table. Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"I've been to other Tilted Kilt locations before so I knew what to expect.  My girlfriend's fries were undercooked.  Our server seemed a bit ditsy and took a long time to check in on us.  It wasn't a terrible experience, but it wasn't great either.  I'd say skip this location."}
{"text":"So I just got up and walked out today.  It's 4:30pm.  About 20 minutes ago I came in, the 4 girls at the door recommended the bar - since I was by myself - so one walked me to the bar.  I sat there for 7 minutes, with only 5 other people at the bar and two bartenders, and was ignored.  So I got out, went out to the door and asked to be seated at a table because the bartender had been ignoring me and two other guys that sat at the bar individually after I did.   The girl seated me, and even though I was in a direct line of sight of three girls who were standing at the bar chatting with each other, I was ignored for another eight minutes.  One of the three even walked around and checked in with two tables in my vicinity drag had already been served, but still ignored me.  After 9 minutes of being ignored at a table, I just got up and left.  It's 4:30pm in the afternoon, the staff on the first floor outnumbered patrons, yet they couldn't even be bothered to acknowledge me.  So I went across the way to Virgil's and had what I believe was a superior meal based on my past Kilt experiences here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ok, so Ive been here four times in the last few months and Ive got to say.. this is hands down, the best Tilted Kilt in the valley.    We've been going here because of Phoenix Comicon meetings we have downtown.  Which is awesome this place opened up..  Because last year we went to Majerles almost every day for lunch for Phoenix Comicon.  THIS will be our new place to hang out.    The food is great.  If you love sweet potato fries.. holy crap, you will love theirs.  Amazing!  The waitresses are wonderful and treat you with the most respect.  Of course they are eye candy and make the Hooter girls seem like nothing. TK knows how to hire beauty.  Even the guys are GQ quality.  Treat them with respect and you get it back. (meaning no oogling to the point you fall out of your chair) So I guess that's why we have a good time there. Drinks are plentiful and management always comes around to make sure you're doing well.    Just love this place and the atmosphere.  TIP: If you want an amazing view of the city, sit outside on the balcony!"}
{"text":"I love their food, but if I have to review this location Im going to base it on the place itself.  We came in right before dinner time and the place looked pretty damn empty. Pretty strange being the nature of the place.  I mean.. come on.  We sat down and ordered our drinks and a short while later we placed our food order.  I split the black bean wrap with my girlfriends daughter and enjoyed the sweet potato fries.  They were good.  I liked the place, but my pick for Tilted Kilt has to go for the downtown location."}
{"text":"I am not a expose your boobs guy at a eatery however.   Its some premium looking ladies at this spot.   Hooters has major competition. The food is ok. Drinks are strong.   So over all not a bad spot."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to go with a group of guys.  Lots of fun.  Lots of TV's with sports and other programming on.  With that said, I have seen families in here too.  Really friendly staff, great food and beer selection.  Servers are always pretty cool and attentive.  I had the flatbread pizza.  It was pretty good.  The nachos were average.  Had calamari too, which was excellent but I wonder why they give you so much marinara sauce with them.  Wings were good too, though I wish they had a hotter option."}
{"text":"We should have heeded the other reviews because this was an awful experience. The place was so loud we couldn't hear our server. We waited an extremely long time for our food and drinks and my husband's burger and fries were cold. Our server vanished for the majority of our time there. When we complained that the food was cold, she had to check with her manager to get anything done. The manager comped my husband's meal (as he should have, since he didn't get to eat anything) but the server should have been empowered to make a decision to improve our experience. Our party asked for two separate cheques and they were split incorrectly. We also discovered that my side (Mac & cheese, which was essentially Kraft Dinner) was an extra $4! The side choices weren't listed on the menu, nor did the server inform us that the different sides were a different price (she only said the \"specialty fries\" were a different price). We won't be back."}
{"text":"Me and my family loved getting wasted here. Everything was so good and we had so much fun watching a basketball game. Try the Guinness, the beer they are known for."}
{"text":"Great service! The girls are friendly and genuinely nice. The food was delicious. My friends and I tried each appetizer on the menu and my absolute favorite had to be the boneless wings! Amazing! I ordered the Kilt Klub sandwiches and I was not disappointed. The French fries were hot and crispy. Great selection of beer. The only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 star review is the fact that the food took forever to come out. About 45 minutes to be exact and by no means was the restaurant full. We went this pat Saturday around 1pm. Would return most definitely if I have about two hours to spend and as you all know, time is money."}
{"text":"How this place is still open is beyond me!!  Went there for the National Championship game and, of course, it was dead .. which I guess was a good thing as we got a good table.  Haven't been here in months and we thought we would give it another try and once again .. horrible.  Service was horrible .. it seems they can't keep good waitresses around very long.  A lot of \"trainees\".  The food was \"so-so\" at best and that bathroom!?!? I've seen better at truck stops. Just close already so maybe we can get a decent place to take that spot."}
{"text":"My Husband  and our friend were here yesterday on The 4th of July we had Jenna as our waitress she was very nice and very welcoming  to  us also very friendly great server the best server we ever had request Jenna when you come  here!!"}
{"text":"I must say that I was actually pleasantly surprised.  I dined at a Tilted Kilt in Louisville, KY and wasn't very impressed at all but this Tilted Kilt was pretty good.  The Tilted Kilt Club was very tasty and the free Irish Nacho appetizer, thanks be to Yelp, was not bad.  The only negative I have is they charged us 99 cents for a taste of their IPA...if I'm gonna drop $70.00 on bar food and beer you'd think they could give us a shots worth of beer to try before buying a pint of it. C'mon guys!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Great food selection. $22 + tip for two hamburger patties(trying to stay low carb), no fries, and a side salad which had hardly any dressing then I got charged for asking for more dressing but hey it's on the Strip so expected as much. All in all I would recommend it though."}
{"text":"I previously wrote a review about this bar, but it no longer seems to be on the web site. I have been here multiple times and the food and beer is always consistent. Irish nachos are great, the beer is good, and they have a monthly beer special. I also liked it because it was next to my apartment and a good location on GIlbert & Baseline. A lot of traffic in this area. So why then is the bar usually empty? I have been here on Friday nights, Saturday nights, and other times most bars would be busy and yet it was not here. In my previous review I included photos showing how empty the bar was and how they had more televisions than patrons. The problem is the bar is marketed toward men who are come there as much for the women working as they do beer, food, or televisions. But too frequently when I visited they had no women. The host was a dude, the server was a dude, the bartender was a dude. On two prior occasions I saw one \"Kilt girl\". Instead it was dudes in kilts. If I wanted to see that I would stay at home, dig my kilt out of the drawer, and look at myself in the mirror. I did go about two weeks ago and I saw a difference - everyone working (the desk, servers, and bar) were Kilt Girls.   Apparently the change was too little, too late. I saw the signs up yesterday (because I always chuckled at the \"Voted Phoenix Number 1 Sports bar\" sign on the side of the building when the bar was usually empty), but today I was surprised to see no signage at all. That stupid sign was down, the name on the building, and the name on the sign all gone. The corporate web site no longer shows the Mesa location and going to their page directly shows Page Not Found Sorry, that page no longer exists...  I was surprised at the suddeness of operational one day, gone the next but I can't say I am surprised it was closed."}
{"text":"I travel to Phoenix often and have been here twice. Both times the service has been great, however, both times I had the same server, Madison. The food was great both times. I ordered the shredded pork tacos the first time and the shepherds pie the second time."}
{"text":"So I am eating and especially drinking guinness in many tilted kilts around the states.  BE CAREFUL!! IN LAS VEGAS THEY CHARGE 11$ FOR A PINT   this was the first time I've had a drink in Vegas tilted kilt. But for sure the last time that I will ever visit tilted kilt elsewhere"}
{"text":"One and done, service sucks for all 10 people in here.   Just needed a cold draft and a late lunch between stops and they couldn't pull it off."}
{"text":"The appeal is not the quality of the food or the speed of service.    The place is clean and the food is comparable to Applebee's."}
{"text":"Cute girls, bad food and cold beer. To be honest I didn't go here for the food but can't beat the free Irish nachos when you check in, just glad I didn't pay for them."}
{"text":"Well the girls were pretty and the beer was cold, bar was clean. However the manager who was bartending was absolutely nuts. She was the one who is also pregnant in case you want to know who she was. Not only was she swearing at staff AND customers, she also spilled multiple drinks that we ordered and took forever to replace them. Wasn't my first trip to the Kilt, won't be my last either, but this experience sucked."}
{"text":"Visited before heading to a concert at US Airways Center. Was a bit of a last option because we hadn't planned on eating so no reservations were made but we were able to get a spot on the patio.  Loved the pretzels, grab one and enjoy! Right after we sat down the place got really busy but service was a bit slow but they were really busy so I guess it's understandable.  Nothing fabulous, nothing terrible."}
{"text":"Horrid service 25 minutes to receive a soda and a beer from the tap. Hardly any patrons but tons of workers standing around doing NOTHING!    OK I would now like to add... The manager came over and was really nice.  He gave us a new waitress.  Made sure our food was out promptly.  Also checked on us a few more times.  Thank you for making amends."}
{"text":"Come here with the fiance to watch the UFC fights on pay-per-view. We get there right before 10pm and usually no problem finding a table. The place does fill up as the night goes on though and some have to watch the fight standing from the bar.   Check in on yelp when you get there to recieve a free Irish Nacho! Although you might have to do some explaining to your server about what this yelp check in thing is all about."}
{"text":"The little girls and their skimpy outfits were a little creepy but the service, pub atmosphere and food was really good. One of our party was visiting from New York City where they are really snobbish about their food and she wanted to go back the next day for the cuisine so that says a lot."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night, based from the statement as being a 'UK inspired pub'.  I had no idea what my friends were talking about all night, I just sat there nodding drinking my $11 Stella (same price as my food?)... Possibly the most annoyingly loud place I have been. Since when did old hip-hop become the music of UK? I've been to bad karaoke nights which still sounded better. The service was super slow, I just wanted to see that bill come out and leave. I gave this 2 stars before writing this, but I won't ever go back, so one star it is! This place needs an overhaul, and an account with NV Energy. Prepare to sweat, they use as much air conditioning as a motorbike does."}
{"text":"I went to Tilted Kilt in Downtown Phoenix on Sunday to watch the Denver Broncos with a friend who was a Denver fan. I did not want to go because 3 times prior I was treated badly at this location.So I decided to try again..OMG!!!!!! We were ignored and no one asked if we wanted to order any food/drinks. We watched as others seated around us received service but not us. We spoke to the manager and guess what? WE STILL DIDN'T GET SERVICE!!!!! Okay I understand things happen. But,4 times in one year? Customer service sucks and the food is marginal at best. I WILL NEVER visit this Tilted Kilt in my lifetime and I will not recommend this place for anyone who is downtown looking for a sports bar."}
{"text":"Came here on a business lunch and was sorely dissapointed. The food was greasy and not that great. We ordered  a cheese fries appetizer which came out cold. Our waitress brought us a new batch which was a lot better. I had a Belhaven on draft, which I was excited about, but could tell that they don't sell much of it and hadn't switched the keg in a while. Well at least you can look at girls in skimpy clothes, but I've done that at other places and gotten much better food and service."}
{"text":"Wish they would update the menu.  Otherwise plenty of eye candy and drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times it's been ridiculous wait times, just to get the bill took almost 30 minutes, second time only came in for drinks with a friend and even just for drinks almost 20-25 mins it took to get a waitresses attention. If your gonna go here make sure you have at least 5 hours to spare."}
{"text":"Time for another of Leslie's Pros And Cons as we went here as a group this week early evening. Our team lead was expensing it and chose Tilted Kilt and you can guess why. These girls are no prudes. The guys said the women are beautiful but slightly overweight. I think the word is voluptuous but I digress.  Pros:  Good steak.  Large beer and alcohol menu Location Friendly waitress that was not rushed or rushing us and chatted with everyone, but that is a problem because...  Cons: Understaffed. Service could be faster as we were not staying late because a few of us wanted to get home and they were not getting food and drinks to us quickly. Many beers on the board and menu were unavailable.  I am personally not a fan of TVs and sports on TV. Whatever! Our waitress was not wearing a tilted kilt lol not that I personally care. It was pretty straight (thanks to Rob for noticing it and even the waitress laughed when she was told) No Scottish food (it is called Tilted Kilt, but there are no Scottish items on the menu. What is up what, guys? lol)  Not sure about the prices because I was not paying, but if you are looking for something different and OK with standard pub food then give Tilted Kilt a try."}
{"text":"How many stars to give? That was the big question? According to Yelp 3 means \"A-OK\" and 2 means \"Meh, I've experienced better\" so that helped me decide because I have experienced better. That's not to say I didnt have a good time, but mainly because of the company I was with. Let's break it down.  The Servers: As advertised, pretty girls in short kilts, who were super friendly. They did their job well and checked on us frequently which was nice.  The Beer: Good selection, good beer, cold, no complaints here.  The Food: Hard to say. I ordered a burger and was told they were out of burgers. This wasnt late night after the burger dinner rush. We got there at 4pm and there were probably under ten people in the restaurant. How can they be out of burgers before dinner time? It's a pub, on  a big sports day (Jay's Home Opener, Wrestlemania) and no burgers. A large part of their menu is burgers!! Anyways, I decided not to order anything else and I left without eating aside from the nachos we shared as a table.  Also, in my three visits to the washroom (I enjoyed the beer) there were no paper towels and no hand dryer. I had to come back to the table with wet hands and use my napkin.   Lot's of TV's and a Great place to watch the game, I just would have liked to comment more on the food."}
{"text":"First time at restaurant. Big screen hard to see when seated right in front of it but the overall \"views\" were nice.  Waitress was ok seemed a little busy and food was normal bar food."}
{"text":"You'd think that every guy would enjoy coming to a pub with female servers dressed in short plaid skirts, crop tops (or whatever they are called), and push up bras to show cleavage. It's not just about that. Good food and great service is what matters.  I came here with my friends for Happy Hour, and we almost ordered the entire Happy Hour menu! I think we might have. We were initially skeptical about the Buffalo Chips because it's just potato chips with a buffalo chicken dip, but our server highly recommended that, so we got it. Lucky we did because the dip was very, very tasty and delicious. We ended up dipping all our other stuff in that dip. Sadly, that was the best part of the meal.  The Boneless Wings weren't very good. It was prepared poorly with the batter all over the place and not even fully on the chicken, and it was bland and overcooked. Pretty disappointing.  We ordered the Sliders, which was a total rip-off. $4 for ONE little slider that looked like a hamburger from McDonalds, but even smaller and more flat? No thank you. There was barely any meat inside the two flattened buns that's just pulled out of the plastic bag to even care to type out any description.  I can throw in the steak skewers in the same category as the sliders. It was so bad that I shouldn't waste my time typing it out. All I need to say was that the beef was bland and way overcooked. Just awful.  The fried mozzarella were soft and mushy, not crispy at all. The cheese is already soft and mushy, so having the batter the same way isn't very good.  We ordered a couple of those Spring rolls, which I didn't eat, but my friends did not like it what-so-ever, and it was a rip-off as well.  The fries were pretty good though. Nicely fried to a crisp and well-seasoned.  The service was okay. When the server was at our table, she was friendly and helpful, but that's only when she was at out table, which was not often.  Overall, I didn't care much about the food that was overpriced and poorly portioned, especially for a Happy Hour. The service was friendly, but lacked attentiveness. I don't plan to return here on my next visit. Sorry, those short skirts, crop tops, and push up bras with cleavage hanging out won't make me come back. Plus, gentlemen don't stare."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go out of my way to return here. We happened to be staying next store in the Sleep Inn, and decided to have a couple beers here. When your staying at the adjacent Sleep Inn or Hampton Inn, it serves as a glorified hotel bar. There is no need for a designated driver.      The Tilted Kilt is a good bar. The $3 draft beer is reasonable. The bar tenders were fast and friendly. The outdoor patio is nice. And the 2 a.m. closing time on Saturday is late enough for me."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night in group of 8. Surprisingly, place wasnt even busy. Servers were busy though \"socializing\" with other customers and the one supposedly responsible for taking our orders wasnt around for good 15mins. I even had to ask the bartender if she could call her for us. It took an hour for our food to arrive and when it did, food was just warm. I had a feeling food was just sitting in the counter for a while. We definitely did not enjoy the food and service here. Seeing other comments here make me think that I wasnt the only one. Anyhow, worst place I have ever been to. Please save your money and go somewhere else. If you wanna see nicer prettier girls, I suggest just go to Moxies or Bier Mrkt. Worst. Just worst."}
{"text":"A relaxed and casual sports bar in Downtown Phoenix, having been to other TK's in Southern California this place needs bigger and more TV's.  Try the BBQ bacon burger with garlic fries and the TK Lager to wash it down.  Good views of Chase Field and US Airways centers."}
{"text":"Visited from California. The scantily clad outfits the servers wore were nice but did nothing for me. The atmosphere was very nice but they didn't have NFL Sunday ticket. I went there - a sports bar- to watch the games. Great menu. I ordered my food to go. Got to hotel, meal was missing the potatoes. 50/50 chance of returning."}
{"text":"A reviewer hit it right  describing it as \"Irish Hooters\".  If that's your thing, fine.  What I contest is the tasteless burger.  I had probably three bites of bread before my taste buds, teeth, or tongue even found the burger.  Then, it was lukewarm, wet from water not grease, square molded as in frozen and thawed perhaps?  It wasn't worth finishing."}
{"text":"Wings were ok, not great. Buddy said his burger was the same, goo not great. Service was mediocre at best. Our waitress paid little attention to us, had to ask for extra napkins and drinks several times. She was more interested in chatting with her co-workers than working our table... Had to ask her for the bill twice. If you are going to base your business on average food and \"eye candy\", then the service better make up for the average food...   It's been hit or miss going to the tilted kilt's various locations. This one is a miss and I will not be back."}
{"text":"I hate chain restaurants. I loathe \"pubs\" that aren't really pubs, and I'm not a big fan of breastaurants.  But the downtown Tilted Kilt holds a special place in my heart.  See, I'm an fan of U.S. soccer. And once upon a time, nobody cared about U.S. soccer. But Tilted Kilt opened its doors to U.S. soccer fans, put matches on the big screen, and said, \"Hey boys, you pound those drums and raise those scarves and get drunk within our four walls.\"  Because this Tilted Kilt location really does treat you like a friend. Everyone is friendly. And there are real personalities behind that corporate logo.  Some key perks:   FREE PARKING. Park in the CityScape parking structure, and TK will validate your parking pass for up to two hours.  SPEEDY TACOS. When you think \"pub,\" you might not thing \"fish tacos,\" but they seriously are the best thing on the menu. And they come out SUPER fast, sometimes faster than your beer.  KILT LIFTER: Of course TK would serve this local brew. But man, it's good. And it gets you drunk like pow.  TOBY & RJ: The Tilted Kilt managers are absolute gems. They come out and shake your hand. They genuinely want to know if you're having a good experience, and they make sure you do. Classy.  Caveat:   SLIDER CITY isn't actually a city of sliders. In fact, it's just one slider, even though there are several in the photo of Slider City. Just know that when you think, \"My, that is an awfully reasonable price for a city of sliders.\""}
{"text":"Not My choice as a place! But we had fun and the patio is killer! Loved it. We had loaded coronas before the game"}
{"text":"Cute spot to watch the game, drink and have nachos, wings and other bar food.   Plenty of TV's around and lots of seating at the bar or tables.   Friendly service and the waitresses were all dressed super cute."}
{"text":"Depending on who you ask, there is either a shortage in the \"breastaurant\" segment (those who want more, probably a certain type of male customer) or an overabundance of them already.  If you compare this segment of restaurants to the overall population of restaurants in Charlotte, then there aren't that many out there: Hooters - which, despite the name, generally doesn't offer much in that department, Bikinis - which recently left the Charlotte market, Twin Peaks - which seems to be doing well in the area and Tilted Kilt. That's a total of five locations in the area - (two Hooters - heh - two Tilted Kilts and a single Twin Peaks location). Five vs all the others? Maybe too many for some, but not really a lot in the scheme of things.  Regardless - Tilted Kilt, like Twin Peaks, definitely offers a more racy uniform than Hooters, so there is that. Their food is perhaps a bit better as well. But unfortunately the whole vibe doesn't work than one that does, offering what appears to be a decent menu, but slow service that hopes you spend more time looking at the goods than paying attention to what you'll get when the product is finally delivered.  I have no doubt that the staff is working to provide good service, but it reminded me more of a strip club, where the food and drinks were secondary (if that) than a restaurant or bar that just happened to have attractive women servers - admittedly, scantily clad ones."}
{"text":"I can't speak to all the negative reviews but I can say my experience was great.  Good comfort food (wings and Irish nachos for me), excellent beer selection and the scenery certainly didn't ruin the experience.  I'll be back for another Kilt Lifter or two!"}
{"text":"The food isn't bad (usually), and they have a decent selection of beers.  But I was expecting (based on the website and pictures) a really hot staff.  It is NOT.  This place might be amazing if you are a woman, I wouldn't know, but I hear the hot guys in kilts there can't be beat anywhere downtown?  Maybe the place to take your BF to show him you're open minded, while drooling over the bartender? The guys In kilts are friendly, cool, and make me feel a bit like I need to get to the gym.  Honestly, it's probably better for women than men, because the guys on staff are good looking built enough to make me extremely jealous. The female staff is about what you would expect at a out of the way Hooters in the middle of nowhere or something, only with more tattoos.  They are in the \"decent, but debatable if I'd even date that\" category.  The food is debatable.  It's a traditional UK'ish menu, which isn't a bad thing.  But it depends on how it's prepared, so when the right cook is working it's brilliant, and worth every penny.  When the wrong cook is working, it might as well be microwaved frozen food.  Honestly, if you at CityScape already and are a guy just looking to see hot staff, you are probably better off at Copper Blues or Gypsy Bar.   But, the female staff is friendlier at the other bars in CityScape.  At Tilted Kilt the female staff sort of act like they hate the fact they are wearing those outfits and hate the fact they have to serve you.  Not a good thing for a theme restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. No wait to get a table, about the only good thing about this visit. From here our waitress couldn't remember my wife's drink order, couldn't seem to refill anyone's drink very quickly, took 40 minutes to get our food and most of it was cold when we got it. When we told the Waitress, she said \"really? It just came off the line!\" Normally I would send it back or tell the manager, but we had a birthday party to go to so we just wolfed it down and left.   I loved the north Scottsdale location but this one has horrible service, I will avoid at all costs. I was not the only one, I heard others complaim as we were leaving too!"}
{"text":"I just ate here and it was horrible. The bartender was to busy to take our order. My husband had to call him over. Finally I got a drink but he forgot my husbands drink. We then ordered food. My food was to burnt to eat. The bartender asked if I wanted them to replace it but I wasn't willing to risk spit in my food. If they have such horrible food and service they will spit in your food. Don't eat or drink there!  U r warned!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for business. Have to say the food is good, comes out hot, and to order. The servers here aren't as friendly as other ones but they are still professional and take care of the table. The only draw back is going to watch football here, twice now was in the bar and the server was working my table and tables clear across the place, she always was saying sorry, but I don't fault her, it's not her job to assign tables.  The food is spot on though, always hot, always to order, even if you ask for tons of alterations to the items."}
{"text":"We've been here once before and had a good experience the first time when Scotch Eggs were amazing, and this a reason why we came back. Scotch Eggs is no longer on the menu. The server explained the menu was updated due to change of management.   One of our orders was the Shepherd's Pie, which looked nothing like the photo in the menu nor any of the photos people have posted on Yelp. The server again explained it had something to do with the updated menu. If they're going to update a menu, the least they could do is update the photo and price accordingly. It was in a shallow mini cast iron skillet about an inch tall, filled halfway up, and about 5-6\" in diameter. My bf doesn't ever want to complain about his food so I didn't embarrass him by taking a photo of it, but it was the saddest Shepherd's Pie I had ever seen. He was still hungry after taking his 6 bites of food, and all the server could offer is ask if we wanted to order more food. No, not after spending $14.00 on this.   We expressed our dismay but she didn't seem concerned at all, didn't offer to call a manager over. In fact, the manager didn't come to our table to verify our discount as shown in our phone app. The server wanted to take our phone away to bring it to the manager. Never, ever, take a customer's unlocked phone. Our server was full of smiles, but smiling cutely at disappointed customers does not make good service. It was a pretty dismal dinner and we don't plan on returning. Too bad Tilted Kilt -- you have great potential in a great location. New management, I hope you're listening."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a couple of nights thier while I was in town. Sat at the bar and both bartenders were great and made sure my hot toddys were just right and of course I had food as well. I sat at the end of the bar close to the entrance and was dissapointed to listen to one of the servers who was on the tall side complain and want to leave early if no one walked in the door in the next 20 min. The next day she was complaining about not making any tips when the other servers seemed quite  satisfied and did thier jobs effectively. Not a good impression and hope she finds the right job for herself. Ending on a high note I did decide to tip the busser that as I found out had worked at the Tilted Kilt for six years and made sure every barstool when emptied was readied for the next patron and was always doing something to make things right for customers. He earned every bit of the $15.00 I tipped him over the two visits I was there over the server that stood there expecting tips for minimal work and complaining in front  of cutomers."}
{"text":"Austin was amazing!  Fast,  efficient and just on it! Very accommodating and friendly. Definitely would return because of him."}
{"text":"Came here with colleagues to grab a bite to eat and the waitress provided quick and exceptional service. I ordered the fish tacos that came with nachos however the fish was a too salty and the nachos were stale. I would recommend to anyone ordering this to substitute it with french fries."}
{"text":"Ouais bon bah... sans plus la nourriture n'est vraiment pas top mon berger était fade et la viande sèche... Je vous conseil donc d'y aller pour une bière !! Bon attention c'est un bar avec des serveuses holé holé"}
{"text":"Going to the Tilted Kilt is what you do when you are in Arizona.   Yes, the girls wear kilts, but the food is pretty good for a sports bar. I did not know this location was so new. Our waitress was either having a tough night or just not with it. I was in town for the MLB All Star events and as soon as the derby ended 100s of people were in this place. We beat the rush to a table, but the waitress had trouble with refills, mixed up our orders, and forgot to bring the check a few times.  The jalapeno burger was really good and the sweet potato fries are a must. They are crunchy and crispy. The kilt burner mayo from the burger made a good dip too. My friend said his Big Arse Burger was just okay."}
{"text":"It's exactly what u want it to be & that makes it awesome. The girls are friendly,the food is good and the outfits are tiny!"}
{"text":"The only appeal this place offers is the bra-exposed-boobs-in-your-face bartenders. Which for me is zero appeal.  I stopped here to meet up with a few friends and grab a drink before the tribe game. It was a Sunday morning so naturally I was craving a Mimosa. They didn't have any champagne so I just ordered a bud light. That turned out to be a mistake since the drinks were quite expensive (around $5-7 for a pint) and the service was extremely slow.   I can't vouch for the food as I only ordered a few drinks."}
{"text":"Worst service ever..no kidding... The bar had maybe 12 patrons in it. We came in with 5 of us. We waited over 30 minutes and had to go to them to pay attention to us. When we finally got to order drinks they said last call was in 10 minutes. We were an airline crew who literally ran to this place after checking in to our nearby hotel. We watched the wait crew ignore us. After a long day we just wanted a few beers. After we finally got to order it took another 20 minutes to get our drinks.... Not slamming Tilted Kilt and the other ones I've been too were great. This place in Mississauga Ontario Canada was the worst. Shame on them.... Yeah, we still tipped the waitress but it was total bullshit."}
{"text":"Happiness - 3.5/5 Deliciousness - 2/5  This place has a great location, beautiful wait staff (both guys and girls), and a great view of downtown Phoenix. But there really isn't much to offer beyond that.   I came for happy hour and almost everything was still $8+. That's pretty steep for brand name beer and bland food. The place was definitely not busy, but the wait staff mainly talked with each other and didn't really  provide fast or attentive service. For example, it took me about 5 minutes to get the bartender to bring me a second beer after finishing my first (while I was sitting at the bar).   I wish the food and service was better as I love the location and the vibe. But with so many options downtown, I just don't think Tilted Kilt gives the best bang for the buck."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for MLB All-Star game and was looking for a place to eat after a HOT day at the ballpark. We stumbled into the Tilted Kilt for a bite to eat. Our waitress Erica was very fast with every request!  Being from San Antonio, wasn't expecting much from the Chips and Salsa but was surprised at how good they were! Very chunky with great seasoning and flavor. Another appetizer that I highly recommend is the garlic fries. Possibly the most antisocial thing to eat but as long as everyone in your party has a few, it's all good! ;)  Everyone seems to focus on the girls in kilts but there is something for female customers too. All the male staff members are wearing kilts too. LOL"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend Kyle for drinks and appetisers one night not bad at all it's located right by the link we have just went on the highroller I know very touristy but it was cute  Afterward we came here and it was nice the on Beyoncé was good bartender was friendly the money was totally gross or fried food or bath food  I think I had a Maskel mule and we shared a fish and chips I would definitely go back again it is located in the link surrounded by a lot of good places  It's not a overly crowded loud place Sexually louder across the way over at yard house"}
{"text":"Ugh...went on Saturday to watch Sun Devils football game and incompetent staff couldn't figure out how to get it on one of thirty televisions.  I left and watched it at Buffalo Wild Wings.  This is the third time the staff has been clueless on organization."}
{"text":"I stopped here for drinks with a female friend/coworker and a male friend from the area during a 2 week business trip.  The bar wasn't very full and the bartender was very attentive.  We didn't have food, the drinks were good but a little pricey, the service was great.  The most interesting part was watching some of the men with those poor girls.  Although I'm sure they know what they are getting into when they take that job. One creepy guy actually hugged the waitress and she looked like she was going to barf, hopefully she got a nice tip! The menu looks like typical pub food, I would go back to try it."}
{"text":"Before the Toronto Rock game last night, we had supper at the Tilted Kilt.  I'd been to the one in Las Vegas in October and enjoyed it.  Gord had the pasta special ... Pesto Alfredo Penne with Chicken (it came with garlic bread).  He said it was very good and he'd get it again.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken (minus the veggies).  It was good and I'd get it again.  It was light on the gravy, though, so I asked for extra (which it turned out they charged me $1 extra for).  The gravy was tasty but was more like a sauce rather than a gravy so that's probably why I needed extra ... plus it was \"covered\" as in the description, more like dipped.  Molly was our server.  Though Gord's beer order got mixed up, she was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"I had a long tiring day and felt like going to a pub ... I had a late supper at the Tilted Kilt Pub and Eatery.  There were lots of TVs (with sports) and the tunes were loud and good.  I ordered a pound of wings with tilted sauce (medium) and a side of fries.  There were nine wings to the pound and they were good and big.  Keri was my server and she took excellent care of me.  I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Visited earlier this year from the State's with a few friends. Stopped here for a quick lunch. Waitress seemed nice and told us about how she was about to visit Los Angeles with some friends and explained how if we paid American she could keep the money and pay the resturant the Canadian back. At the end of our meal we paid in American but she kept the change and never came back to the table. When we confronted her she handed us a single amount for  'bus fare' which amounted to a few coins versus a considerable amount of money between the 3 of us. Plans to visit Toronto and stay in the same hotel across the street but will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"So of course by now everyone knows that the Titled Kilt is like Hooters and all those other chain restaurants where the female waitresses and bartenders are dressed in skimpy clothing. That really doesn't bother me. I have a close friend who works at a Titled Kilt in Orlando (never visited that one).  What does bother me is the absolutely terrible service and the ridiculous prices. The first time I visited was during a Steelers game with my bf, his friend from work, and his friend's two sons. Thought this place was spot-on for some game watching and beer chugging. Our first waitress was great: friendly, knowledgable, and came back to check on us often enough. Well, her shift ended well before we were done so she introduced us to the girl taking over. That was the last time we saw her. Seriously. We'd drained our beers, the kids had polished off their meals and nothing. A half hour later, still nothing. It was busy, yes, as to be expected during football Sunday, but seriously? My bf finally had to get up and track her down to get our check. What a horrible experience.  My next visit was on St. Patrick's Day. It blows my mind that more restaurants and bars downtown and on the North Shore didn't have specials. $5 Bud Light - I guess. $10 Jager bombs - WTF. 2 beers and 2 jager bombs cost us over $30. That should NEVER happen, I don't care how nice the place is - and this place isn't that nice, it's just a regular sports bar. Also, the bartender serving us was less than attentive, though she sure overcompensated for it with the bro-y dudes to our left who were catcalling her like mad. I swore then that was the last time I would be back. As mentioned in other reviews, I'd rather go to Bettis two doors down."}
{"text":"Bartender (Danielle) at the bar was foul-mouthed, loud, and obnoxious.  Really put a damper on the experience.  Their beer specials aren't that good ($5 Stella)."}
{"text":"Wait staff is second to none....Awesome! Had a great time, partied hard, definitely heading back."}
{"text":"Fun,  flirty and fresh!  Wings were hot and tasty,  beer served in tall glasses by waitresses and bar maids with their breasts all but falling out!   All the girls were wearing a tiny little bikini top,  all had huge breasts which added to the atmosphere.   It really was fun and tasty.  My neck got sore from all the twisting.   They had lots of televisions on to watch various types of games."}
{"text":"I ordered the Irish Nachos. BIG MISTAKE. At other restaurants, irish nachos are sliced potatoes that are then fried (like french fries but sliced into rounds instead of strips). At the Tilted Kilt, it's Lay's potato chips with cheese and ground beef on top. Are you kidding me? The ground beef was poor quality, and on top of that, it wasn't even seasoned. My husband got the boneless wings and I asked him how they were and he was like, \"eh.\" Our other friends were also disgusted with the food - they ordered what I did. My husband was sorely disappointed with the beer selection. Also, our server was terrible. She took one order and left the table - didn't bother to ask if anyone else wanted anything to eat or drink. What? I had to call her back to the table to get the rest of our orders. Spent a ton of money and the food, beer, and service were garbage. We're never going back. You're probably better going to that other tacky sports bar. At least they have better beer selection!"}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences of my life! Our poor waitress was very overwhelmed and took 15 minutes to take our drink order. Our appetizers made it before our drinks did and was tossed on our table like garbage by the runner who quickly left without giving us the opportunity to ask for plates, napkins, and silverware which took another 10 minutes to get. Spinach dip tasted like it just came out of the microwave and had zero flavor and the chips were just a pile of crumbs.  just plain gross! Drinks showed up in what could only be described as a cheap flimsy plastic cup you would get at a frat party. Food showed up and was inedible! My husband's Shepards pie had a disgusting gray color with what appeared to be under hydrated potatoes. To add insult to injury, I was charged $1.00 for ranch dressing that I had to ask for multiple times and didn't even show up until I was done eating. was too upset to complain about the dollar. Bathroom was covered in toilet paper and even had a wine glass on top of the toilet paper holder. I'll go to McDonald's next time!"}
{"text":"Decent food for a pricy amount. My friends tell me their selection of beer is a good one, but I'm not a drinker so I couldn't say.  This restaurant is styled after an Irish pub, the walls are lined with tvs, so if you're a sports fan, this is your place. Cute place actually. The service is fast even when they are busy, I am just not a fan of the outfits that the employees wear. The girls wear skimpy little skirts with crop tops and their breasts falling out of the shirt. The bartenders stay true to Irish tradition and wear kilts. Not my kind of place to eat. I do not want bear men legs or breasts in my face as I eat.  I will not return, but to each their own."}
{"text":"Eww, food was horrible.  Only reason I gave it 1 star was because the fries were decent.  Eww. Never again"}
{"text":"Eeeh, if I had to say one thing about this place it would simply be - meh. The drinks here are fine, though honestly this place is pretty much a simple and loud beer + pub grub tourist joint in Vegas.  I didn't order any food but my friends who grabbed some grub weren't particularly fond of it (we ended up going to another bar and eating more food there).  The servers were cute and friendly though it was extremely busy that night and they weren't around very often to check up on our huge party.    This place has a pretty big bar area and also a large second floor to accommodate a large number of patrons.  The bathroom here was kind of cool though.    There's just too many place in Vegas to get drunk at.  Unless you happen to be in this particular area, I would say you're better of checking out the countless number of other bars and lounges at your disposal."}
{"text":"I work in CityScape, so the location makes this a prime option for lunch. Unfortunately, the service always fails expectations. I'm guessing most of the customers don't mind this (see reference to creepy old dudes in reviews below)...but I do mind.  So, my co-workers and I have decided to order pick-up a few times.  They can't even get that right.  Too bad, the food is fine.  I usually order the buffalo chicken wrap, which I happen to like a lot...but let's face it, I can get buffalo chicken sandwich at Lucky Stripe for $3 less and be reasonably sure I'll get what I order when I order it."}
{"text":"We had lunch there today. The service and atmosphere were fine. But the food was, as another reviewer described it, Denny's quality. My nachos looked good and there was real cheese on the top. But under the top layer, the cheese appeared to be like Cheese Wiz or something similar. That resulted in soggy nachos. The meals of others in my party appeared to be mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Tilted Kilt is alright. I have been here a few times and what stands out in my mind is nice decor with many tvs, good beer selection, but crappy service and food. I am really big on service, coming from the industry for over 7 years, so when I get bad service, I get in a bad mood. The girls are pretty lucky they are hot because I don't think it would fly otherwise. The fish n chips I had were not good, obviously just poured from a bag, which is disappointing. I felt the server was really flaky and inattentive, she was sitting with a group of guys pretty much the whole time, while I was waiting for my napkins, then my malt vinegar, ugh. Then she came to tell us she was going on a smoke break and I don't think I saw her after that. All in all, I can appreciate a cute girl in sexy kilts (I was actually hired to work here when they first opened) and I love me some good beers and flat screens, but I will pass on the whole dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is racist. Clearly there were open tables on the main lobby but yet my party was placed in the corner, hidden in the left side of the building; we were the only party in that area. The waitress was rude and unprofessional, her name is Brooke, by the way. We are on vacation from California where apparently the tiltedkilt is more open. Management and owners should be ashamed of themselves and this place. Don't come here if you are a minority."}
{"text":"This place is decent for a bar but the food is terrible . I would go for drinks only if anything. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because they recently opened, but waiting 15 minutes for drinks isn't acceptable. Maybe they should focus on hiring servers who have severed before and not just attractive girls. Their beer selection was pretty good and they had a lot of tvs."}
{"text":"walked in, got seated immediately, server and bus boy quick to clean up table, food came quick. ordered blue cheese burger garlic fries were amazing. server was attentive nice. in and out.  solid."}
{"text":"The food was decent, typical bar food. The service was also average, nothing spectacular. I was mostly just glad that they were open on Sunday afternoon! It was amazing how many places were closed on Sundays in downtown Phoenix. Glad this place was open, not too busy and had decent food. The sweet and spice chicken tenders were really good! We were a little too early for happy hour, but it looks like the Happy Hour specials are decent!"}
{"text":"As much as I'd like to give this place a good review, I just can't. TK is always reliable for one thing: atrocious service. It is pretty much guaranteed, five times out of ten, that you will be ignored for about 5 minutes until the servers get it together. And, in a completely unapologetic manner, they will eventually take down your order.   In one specific instance, of horrible service, we went to TK to watch the 2014/2015 NBA Finals. On that occasion, the fire alarm went off and everyone was asked to leave the restaurant (but only after we were asked for our ID's so that we didn't skip out on the meal). Upon returning, we sat back down at our seats to our cold food. The server apprehensively asked if we would like our food reheated. We said no, it would probably be fine, but we would like a discount on our meal. We received no such discount and no manager ever made an effort to approach our table. However, anyone would feel mean if they pressed the matter to an inexperienced server that had probably just turned 18 or 19.   I cannot, in good conscience, give this restaurant a good review. But hey, they'll stay in business because after all, it's not the service or the food they're concerned about. It's about the sex appeal. Any sap that get's flirted with, by a cute girl, isn't going to complain about the service.   DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO TO MAJERLE'S!!!!!! Better food, cute ladies, and they don't treat you like shit."}
{"text":"WOULD CHOOSE ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE! My husband and I dropped by this last Saturday night at about 5:15pm. We were seated and was told that someone would be by shortly. We waited over ten minutes and not one employee stopped at our table, not even to get our drinks. We were even seated along a busy walk area and nothing! And worst part was there were 5 girl employees crowded around the bar not even 15 feet from us, too busy chatting with each other. So we got up and left and on our way out, one of them said \"Have a nice night!\" Like really!?!?  Don't waste your money here! My husband and I traveled 4 miles down Bell to Twin Peaks and the service was great and the food delicious! We didn't have a hard time dropping $80 there :) and we will def go back to that place. BUT NOT TO THE TILTED KILT!"}
{"text":"Good food  Service is fluctuating sometimes it is good sometimes it is bad  Don't invite friends during band night u can't hear sh*t"}
{"text":"I'd never been to a Tikted Kilt before as we don't have one where we live, but we were staying at the Linq and decided to stop in for lunch as it was convenient.  It was not crowded at all when we went, so the service was very attentive.  My husband ordered the Fat Bastard Mac and Cheese, and I ordered the Irish Dip sandwhich.  My husband loved the Mac and cheese, and said it tasted like fetucinni Alfredo but with macaroni and buffalo chicken (he loves Alfredo so that's a good thing).  The sandwhich was very tasty.  The bread was fresh and the meat was tender and seasoned well.  Prices were a little on the high side for what it was, but compared to some other places on and near the strip, we considered it fairly reasonable.    We were in Vegas celebrating my birthday.  At the end of our meal, our waitress brought us a warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream that was divine!  Out of all the establishments we visited during the three and a half days we were in Vegas, including a rather expensive restaurant that we ate at later that evening where it was noted when we made the reservation that we were celebrating a birthday, the Tikted Kilt was the ONLY one that did anything special for my birthday (except for Sprinkles, where I got a lovely complimentary cupcake, but it was because I had signed up for their rewards program and had a coupon).  The expensive place we went to for dinner didn't even ask us if we were celebrating anything special (despite the fact that it was noted on the reservation) or so much as wish me a happy birthday. I am totally okay with restaurants not giving away anything for birthdays, but acknowledgement in the form of a simple \"happy birthday\" is always nice and goes a long way.  Tilted Kilt went above and beyond and I will remember that the next time I am near one!"}
{"text":"Great Scenery for sure!  I did Not Like that they have a small \"Limited\" Food Menu when it's Game Day for the Pirates.  I had the Scottish CheeseSteak with Fries and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I stopped in to the Tilted Kilt after a Yelp Event. I was pleased at the beer variety. I had a decent time at the bar although we were not told the beer specials. After my date and I ordered our drinks, another group sat down next to us and they were told about beer specials upon their arrival. SO I spent $20 on two beers with tip when I could have ordered a different beer and spent half of that."}
{"text":"this place is horrible.food is terrible. the frozen appetizers comes out still cold and half thawed. way overpriced. lousy pours on alcohol. i would never go near this place on the weekends and have to deal with all the douchebaggery. if you make it on a weekday for reverse happy hour you can score a 90 schilling or a decent IPA for $3, honestly no sense in going here even if all your buddies are super horny, might as well just skip the overpriced bs and just buy them a lap dance at the strip club. i guarentee you they will enjoy it more than going to a horrible creation of an \"irish\" hooters....."}
{"text":"Well we didn't have a Tilted Kilt in Cincinnati, so this was a bit new to me, but not really new. It was like a Hooters but the ladies are scantily clad in kilts and plaid bras that pop out over the tops of their well endowed shirts.   First thing I'll say about this place in comparison to Hooters though, is OMG their food is SOOOOOOOO much better here. I hated going to Hooters if we were just having some food and not for hanging out because ugh their food is terrible! But, in their defense I am not a wing person, and I know that's the ONLY reason everyone goes there.... insert heavy sarcasm here...   But seriously, wow the food was way better and the staff were super friendly as well as the patrons. I made new friends just walking to the bathroom! There are tv's literally all over the place with different games and sports being broadcast on all of them. Prices were reasonable and the menu had a nice selection. If you are craving dessert then get the cookie and ice cream... My life was complete the moment I took a bite of that warm macadamia nut ice cream covered cookie. NOM NOM NOM...   It's a bit of a drive for me, but I'd definitely go back again sometime."}
{"text":"This is a very mixed review. On one hand the service was quick, attentive....and attractive.   But I feel like I kinda got ripped off on the bone-in wings. I glanced at the menu and didn't see how many wings came in the $12 dinner portion. I should have asked, because I received 7 or 8 small wings. I was very disappointed in this portion. They were warm, but should have been hot. Some of them were more warm and mushy rather than the crispy wings I crave. The amount of meat per wing was 3rd tier. Ughh. Maybe they required a few more minutes in the fryer. But I did enjoy the sauces.  I'll take Wingstop or sonic BOGO for my when my next wing craving hits. But maybe I'll be back for some beers and baes."}
{"text":"Our food was pretty good but then again it's just your standard bar food, kind of hard to mess up.  Service was alright, not horrible but the servers weren't as attentive as I would have expected.(They do work for tips right?) We sat out on the outdoor patio, beautiful night out.  We had front row seats for the firework show that took place after the baseball game, which was pretty cool.  I would have given the place 3 stars however; after we ate we saw a huge cockroach make his way across the outdoor patio. It turned my stomach so bad, I will never go back.  I am in no way saying the place has cockroach infestation BUT the fact that it had one on the outside deck where we just ate will forever deter me from returning.  Don't waste your time; there are plenty of other places downtown to eat at!"}
{"text":"I hated this place.   It's loud, annoying and if the music were any louder, I'd be front row at a Chumbawamba concert with drunktards. The AC stinks because my sweat was sweating. I feel sorry for the staff that has to work here. We had 2 Coors, 1 Blue Moon and a Michelob Ultra which cost $37. We didn't even eat anything.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars. Came in at 7:00 got seated right away. Waitress never introduced herself or asked if we needed drinks until around 7:30. During that entire time she sat at another table and counted what I assumed to be her daily tips. Once that was complete she went and chatted it up with the hostess. Once she finally got done socializing she came and asked if we needed drinks. I asked for the manager which was very understanding and even offered discounts. I politely refused and my wife and I left. I hope the waitress made enough in tips because she might get cut on some hours."}
{"text":"I did know what I was getting into when I stopped at the new Tilted Kilt in Matthews. I had heard they have decent food and wanted to give it a try, so we stopped in during their first couple weeks in business.  We went on a weekend night and, as to be expected, it was packed. Other reviewers have described the concept well enough that I will not rehash the descriptions (and I'll keep my mildly feminist opinions to myself). On this visit, maybe due to the crowd, maybe do to whatever game was on, it was loud. Very loud. For me, that is many times a turn off.  Our server arrived and took our drink orders. I was disappointed in the beer menu. Guinness, Harp, Budweiser, Miller, etc etc...a few craft and NC brews, but they seem to focus on the cliched name-recognition UK imports (and no Scottish beers...where's the BrewDog?) and the standard NASCAR offerings. Blech.  The food, however, did live up to its reputation. They do have one of the better burgers in Matthews and the garlic fries were a nice touch. The meat was moist and flavorful and the other toppings fresh and cut to a reasonable size.  The girls who work here (with the exception of the cook, bartender, and manager, it seemed to be an all-female staff - no surprise there) were very attentive and seemed to have a grasp on the menu. I was confused, though, when our server changed half-way through for no apparent reason and with no explanation.  As I said, the food is good. The bar, concept, and ambiance, not so much. Maybe I'll log this one as \"take out only\" for the future."}
{"text":"This wasn't our first choice downtown, but the only place that was still open on a Sunday evening and wasn't too far from where we'd parked the car. You might be OK at a place where the girls have various body parts falling out of their clothes. This just isn't my thing, and I would never come here normally, but everyone else in my party was fine with the idea or they were hungry and thirsty.    Our waitress arrived quickly to our table, and I ordered an Irish cider that was excellent (not on draft but still very good) and our table ordered a sampler platter. After well past the time when our food should have arrived, we asked our waitress what happened to the platter. She let us know that it was given to another table (who hadn't ordered food--lucky them) by another waitress, but that she had put a rush order on another one, well, for us. Hmmm.  When the sampler platter did arrive, the onion rings were very good. The chicken wings had a spice level of 5, so they immediately burnt my lips. If you can handle spicy food, go ahead and order the level 5 burn. The tater tots had an unusual sauce that wasn't to my liking, but the mozzarella sticks were great, especially when dipped into one of the three sauces that was served with the platter.  I probably won't be back unless it's the only place open, and peer pressure makes me do it."}
{"text":"The food was alright and the atmosphere was as expected. The problem was our service. We were there prior to a local sports event and in a little bit of a hurry. Our waitress picked up our plates and we told her we didn't need refills on our empty drinks. It was pretty clear we were ready to go. She did not return for agonist half an hour, and even then, she asked if we were still \"okay\". We asked for the check and she left again to get it since it still want ready. The service means enough that we will probably not return."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing Irish about this place Unless you count the sleezy outfits the staff is forced to wear.  Regular bar food.  Not what I was hoping for. Oh well..just won't go back. Gotta try at least once right?"}
{"text":"A variation of hooters. The staff dress in provocative attire and the clientele are mostly male (as expected). The food is delicious and the specials are even better. They have half price appetizers during happy hour which makes it that much better value."}
{"text":"Beautiful servers of course and the food was decent. I had one of the burgers with avocado and it was good although a little plain. So i would say that i'm probably not a professional on the menu because i haven't tried much of their menu. I do like the environment and the service was great. Very attentive and other servers were very fast to clear tables and ask their customers if they were satisfied. Overall, i would go back and hope that their other food taste much better than their burgers."}
{"text":"TV's everywhere.   Sat at the bar and the bartender was a sweetheart.  She helps open new pubs for the particular group that owns this one and she is an asset to their company.  Had the chicken sandwich with hot sauce and it was good.  3 stars for food and an extra for a great bartender."}
{"text":"Sat down at the non-busy bar for about 7 minutes. Four or five \"bartenders\" behind the bar and not one of them realized that we needed a drink but everyone else that came up to the bar after us were served first. I even had my ID out...waiting patiently and trying to make eye contact with anyone who looked like they worked there. It was pretty appalling. Pretty much the worst place for service at the Linq, in my experience so far.  We left when we overheard someone get charged $24 for three drinks. One of them was a coke. Went to O'Sheas instead and were served right away. Four drinks, two of them shots, for about $30, all in the matter of 2 minutes within sitting down."}
{"text":"We come here often to watch football, grab some food and have a few beers. The service is usually pretty good and the atmosphere is fun as well."}
{"text":"Come here for the Oklahoma Sooners watch party. The atmosphere is fantastic and the food is always good. It is priced  a tad bit high and would like to see game day food specials, but all in all a great place."}
{"text":"Nothing like the commercials!  All we did was grab a few beers.  It is like a grungier Hooters, if that is even possible.  The beers were cold and the bartender was kind of helpful."}
{"text":"Hooters meets Renaissance Faire.  Yeah, that's about it.  The group that brought me loves the place, so I'm sure it has its good points but it's not for me."}
{"text":"Boobs and beer.  What else do you need?  We don't have The Tilted Kilt back east so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I actually was pleasantly surprised.  The girls were all friendly and good looking.  From the few Hooters I have visited in my time they're usually trashy and skanky.  Not the case here.    We were greeted right away and found a place to sit.  I ordered whatever their own beer is.  It was good.  We ordered a few apps which were typical pub grub but not greasy.  The potato skins had a little kick to them which I liked.  Our waitress Sarah was great.  Very friendly and helpful.  We also kept moving seats and this didn't seem to bother her.  I would come back."}
{"text":"First time last time.  Had a bowl of chili came on like a saucer it was so small.   Fish n chips VERY small.  So if you're here to look at girls with too much make up you're in the right place."}
{"text":"Stopped in before a concert at nearby Brooklyn Bowl. It was a Sunday evening, and the place was  semi busy, definitely not packed. There were four young ladies standing at the hostess station, and they were very friendly when we walked in the door. We told them we would sit at the bar, and none of them had to move from the desk to show us to a table. I don't think any of them left that hostess station the entire time we were there.  The bartender(s) ignored us until we asked for their attention. Too busy chit-chatting to take care of a couple of tie-dyed concert goers, I suppose. After getting us our drinks and handing us menus, they disappeared around the bar and we had to get their attention again to place our food orders.  The food was not bad; not great. The service was so terrible that we left with a bad taste in our mouths, however. There are too many great restaurants in Vegas to waste your time in this one. We are locals and will NEVER go back to this place."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Tilted Kilt via Ubereats multiple times. The chicken fingers are so tender and the sauce is really good. I also got a Caesar Salad which was a good portion for the price. I would definitely go eat there if I was looking for a dinner out."}
{"text":"So I just came here a second time.  Which maybe I shouldn't have because the first time was wonderful. I had great service.. the manager (jared) was amazing and I loved that I could bring my dog.   I came tonight and it was the complete opposite.  I had suggested this to my brother ans multiple friends who I haven't seen for months.  Our food wasn't served at the same time and my boyfriends nachos served cold.  We then bought drinks which we were not told is not on the menu and the ingredients charged seperately... and charged $12 per drink ($6 for a fireball shot inside of my angry orchard) (that same shot is in another specialty drunk with ice cream for $8.00 total).  Charged full price for the shot and full price for the beer.  It was not explained to us this was the case.  We did not check if it was on the menu we just knew what we wanted.  The absolute worst part of our service was the manager Brent. As I work in the staffing industry I have to say it's upsetting there are so many beter customer service driven individuals who could have done his job better than him in their sleep. It's upsetting someone like this makes a good wage while others are over looked.  As we explained to him how upsetting it was that I didn't get to have a meal with my family all at the same time and how the drinks were served at a completely unfair price without any explination as to why he just repeated \"I apologize for that\". He then told us we should have sent our food back and told them not to make new food if we wanted it adjusted off of our bill....  (we came there to eat.. so we were all hungry and expecting food; hot and at the same time..) he apologized in such a fake uncaring way I couldn't believe it.  We were given free appetizer cards for \"the next time we come\"  (durring happy hour) as if this service would bring in future customers.  We were then told they close at 12 every Friday even though the door states two \"The door wouldnt state 2... we never stay open that late\".... funny... I have a picture of the doors tonight... they close at \"2\" on fridays.  The waitress later told us that they close early everynight because no one is there.... hmmm... wonder why.   This guy's doesn't seem to know anything about customer service or management and because of him I (nor my family)  will never come to this location again.  I will also be contacting corporate with an official complaint."}
{"text":"The food is subpar - even for barfood. The place is not the cleanest.   The truth of the matter, however, is that the women here blow the doors off the women of hooters. Not bad if you are in town and want to check out the latest flesh festival franchise."}
{"text":"You should understand what you're coming here for and not be surprised. The reviews where people are shocked by the girls outfits, or the noise just seem idiotic.  You go to this place to watch sports, glance at pretty young girls in revealing outfits and drink beer. There shouldn't be any surprises, haha.  Pros: Lots of beers, great views of TV's pretty much everywhere with sound, convenient location if you're downtown, lots of pretty girls in skimpy clothing, great apps and snacks, the entrees are hit or miss.  Cons: Service isn't super fast but it's not bad. Prices could be better and have more specials/happy hour.  Will definitely go again in any city that has one if there's a game on."}
{"text":"I mean what the actual F ... This place is a hot mess express. Put it out of its misery ... twice"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Nice girls in mini skirts with gorgeous figures and bra-tops will be pleasant for your eyes, as well as handsome built men in kilts will entertain girls:) drinks were great. First time ever I enjoyed Bloody Mary. Never expected to have it so light and spicy to drink but really hitting your head. My steak salad as well as husband's burger were delicious. Even lil confusion because of kitchen time management with our appetizer was professionally and fast resolved by our waitress. So I would definitely comeback to enjoy couple cocktails and football with burger!"}
{"text":"Waitress had absolutely no personality. Working at a place like this, you need to be friendly and on your game with your customers. We had to ask for napkins, silverware, salt/pepper, and condiments. Food was alright. Definitely had better. One good thing was that the hostess at the front door had a great personality. Wish she was our waitress."}
{"text":"I had a lovely time here with my sister and her boyfriend! The service and food were nothing short of fantastic. About a week after my visit, I noticed through my banking app that I had been over-charged. I knew it had to have been a mistake considering my server was an angel. I called, asked to speak to a manager and within no time was the problem resolved! Amazing staff, amazing energy and awesome food. I will for sure be back again."}
{"text":"I never heard of this place but my brother who doesn't live in Vegas wanted to go.  The staff was awesome on both occasions in which i visited.  On 09/18/17, I attended MNF at this bar. Living in Vegas there are other places to go but after going to this bar, I don't want to go anywhere else. The  staff are friendly and on this occasion, Bri. I was seated almost immediately and ordered. Food was hot and came in quick. Bri ensure we were satisfied with our food and drink. During the game, a member in our party wanted to watch another off market game. Bri and the manager put the game on a different tv.   Once again, great food, great customer service and friendly atmosphere. This place is it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Sunday lunch with friends. Casual diningroom and bar decorated with a variety of posters, photos and artifacts from Scotland.  To start, the menus were very old, worn and smelled of old food. The dining room carpet and bathrooms were less than clean.  Although the gentlemen in our party enjoyed the waitress attire, we ladies were a bit uncomfortable with the brevity of costume. Having said that the staff is friendly and attentive. The Irish nachos were enjoyed by the meat eaters in the party. That was the best part of the meal. The steak and cheese was over cooked. The shepards pie (actually cottage pie) was extremely greasy. The fish 'n chips were unusually greasy, even for fried food but it was cooked well (not over done).  The prices are reasonable, beer selection good. I would recommend this place for men to stop in for a beer but suggest you go elsewhere for food. Definitely not a date or family night location."}
{"text":"If you are a girl prepared to be ignored. Completely different service given to us chicks than what the guys get. Weird.. I love Nick the manager though, he is one of the reasons I will always come back!  Their food is good though and the happy hour specials are awesome."}
{"text":"I just saw this on Undercover Boss and am shocked at how the owner has the gall to say he thinks his establishment is classy. He employes WHORES!  A few months ago, one of the waitresses came on to my husband and even handed him her business card with her name Lauren with XXX circled with a heart. The waitresses are dressed in bras with their boobs almost completely hanging out and the skimpiest little skirts - I wouldn't even call them skirts. It is a whoring establishment, with a restaurant/bar front. The waitresses are not at all professional. I am thoroughly and totally disgusted, especially after the owner goes on national TV pretending that his pick up bars with scantily clad girls are professional restaurant establishments. They are not. They are far from it. Start with the costume.  It covers almost nothing."}
{"text":"Good food and a great place to watch the game.  It is in need of a good cleaning for sure.  Dust everywhere and 3-4 waitresses just hanging out by the front...  Could have been cleaning or doing something.  Bathrooms in dire need of update.  Overall pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"The burgers here are really good and worth the $10 plus price.  Service is friendlier and seating is more plentiful than the Arrogant Butcher up the street!"}
{"text":"Not really a fan of these types of places to begin with. Never had issues with service but it is really overpriced. I love the flat screen HD tv's. Food was okay, nothing impressive. Drinks are decent."}
{"text":"Pros: Broad menu selection. Cons: Unrealistic beer prices... at least, for Guinness. At $6.50 per (imperial) pint, it's the most expensive Guinness in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good place to stop if you're waiting for a flight or for rush hour traffic to die down. Especially if you're into short skirts and cleavage."}
{"text":"Well, big bummer!  Dublin Stew is no longer on the menu.  In addition Kiltlifter is no longer served.  Queso dip was bland.  Fish was soggy and serving sizes have been shrunk. 2 stars only because the service was good."}
{"text":"This place is packed and popular. Pretty girls, good food, and a surprising selection of decent beers. Guess each location has some flexibility in the brew they serve.  But back to the packed and popular for a minute. It's really, really busy. It's really, really noisy. And the parking lot is really, really full. At least it was when our big group -- #evfn -- was there Friday night.  Our waitress did an admirable job of handling a group of our size, especially when you consider that some of us like to get up and move around. She handled it great!  If busy and loud places aren't your style, you're probably not going to appreciate going there on a Friday. But I don't mind that stuff, so none of that detracted from the score.  If you like sports bars that ARE loud and busy, of if YOU ARE loud and busy (that's me!), you'll like it just fine."}
{"text":"I come here once in a while for a drink or a snack. There's always different sports on all the TVs and if I request a channel, they put it on for me. The staff members are all friendly, the food is decent, the drinks are usually made right, and the servers and bartenders are nice to look at. Well, some of them. I have never had a full meal here but my friends and I will either pre-game here or end the night here."}
{"text":"Ordered burger and fries.  Had to fight to get water refilled.  Long wait for food and nearly died from lack of water service.  BUT the worst was the music.  VERY loud garage band music when the average age of patrons was about 55-60.  I am 60% hearing impaired and would have left without ordering had I known how loud and bad the music was....what ever happened to Irish music?  Last but not least, the beer prices were so high, that out of about 16 tables of patrons around us, only ONE person drank beer......that is over 50 patrons who refused to pay the price at the Kilt!  And the temperature outside was about 100 degrees!  NO HAPPY HOUR EITHER!!  My wife and I would have each had TWO at a reasonable price.  So....we won't be back and will spread the word to our friends and relatives to AVOID this place."}
{"text":"Just confirming the many other poor reviews.   The food, unless you stick to fried fare is awful.    The waitstaff is generally lazy. As someone pointed out they tend to collect at the hostess station and chit chat. They eventually get around to check on their tables when they feel like it which is pretty infrequent.  If you go and sit at the bar to drink you are probably ok. Otherwise forget it.  Not sure how the management lets it get this way."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, beers tasted like beers, well drinks tasted like slightly watery well drinks. Sweet bartender who was very attentive. Crazy expensive for happy hour fare and drinks. Probably won't be back.  This is more like a 2.5 star review"}
{"text":"This is our go to place when we are tired of eating at Margaritaville. The food is good and there is an excellent selection of draft beers. We always get the buffalo wings, which come with French fries. The wings are no BW3s, but they are pretty good. Located in The Linq, the location is ideal. Service is always good, and they seem to care about their customers. I would rate 3.5 stars, if able. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I went to the Tilted Kilt last week for lunch and enjoyed the place so much that I went back that same night for drinks with some friends.  The waitresses are smoking hot and the food is great.  I recommend the Chicken Cesar Wrap!  Our waitress was very personable as well.  The drink prices are high, but was to be expected and was on par with every other pub/restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Just ridiculous. Wait staff was some of the worse I ever had. It wasn't due to her being new or untrained but just completely apathetic. I used to work in a bar so I'm not unsympathetic to the trade and am usually forgiving of poor service, but it was like this a few more times before I decided it was not worth it to return despite the amount of sports I get to watch at once.  Perhaps this is just a place for lecherous men to stare at skimpily dressed adolescent girls, rather than a sports bar. And perhaps that was the problem, the times I was there it was to watch a game and not fawn over the server, and for that my table and I received poor and indifferent service.   Trade the big screen for better service and watch your sporting events at a real bar. This place sucks unless you like processed food, and crappy beer served to you with incompetent contempt."}
{"text":"I wish I could say more good things about this place but I was very disappointed.  Okay, the girls are pretty and there is a lot of TV's.  That's it.  The food is overpriced and not very good.  Same for the drinks.  Afterwards, my friends and I wished I went somewhere else.  Definitely over rated.  Hooter's would of been a better idea, lol. The one bright spot was there was a guy in our group that I befriended that day.  He was a childhood friend of one of my buddies.  He ended up picking up the check which was over $200.  Thanks Dave."}
{"text":"This was right across from the hotel we were in and looked like it should be a hoot (pun intended) but regardless of the scarcity of the waitresses clothing there is no reason to go here. The food was nothing but sad and tasteless and the service abysmal. Heed my warning and stay away."}
{"text":"Stopped by last weekend with my family while we were in town on vacation. Can't say it's the best Kilt we've ever visited, being from San Diego they are much better there. It was just ok, probably won't visit again."}
{"text":"I only had the drinks during this visit. I ordered Jameson on the rocks. The bartender was efficient and quick with service.  The drink was an average pour and went down well. This place does get busy and very loud at times. The bartenders are mainly a young hipster crew that make it a fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"I defer to my review of the South Tempe location on this place. I ate here last night. It's pretty much the same.   To sum up - decent to good food (for sports bar food), attractive servers wearing skimpy outfits, stiff drinks at reasonable prices, and sports on big screen tvs. It's really not my kind of place because I'm not into sports or hanging out with mostly men who are all there to look at the servers and I'm also trying not to eat so unhealthy. Aside from that though, I can recommend it.  One thing I didn't say in my other review in which I compared Tilted Kilt to The Library and Hooters (because they're all basically the same kind of place), is that out of the three - this one is the most consistent and probably the best. The Library is a close second on average, but it depends entirely on when you go.  This location has a nicer patio than the Tempe location. Also, the servers here are a little more attractive than they are efficient. I'd put TK between a 3 and a 4. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"I've been to many TK's and this by far may be the worst. The service was horrible. We got our beer 20 mins after we ordered it, after finished it never asked for another until they brought our food which was cold and over cooked. I will continue to visit this chain just not the one downtown"}
{"text":"Waited at bar with my wife for over 15 min. Finally switched over the other side of bar. Bar was not busy. Waited and waited. Bartender busy talking to fellow employees. Won't be back. Horrible experience"}
{"text":"APPETIZERS: The garlic butter cheese fries were amazing, just like you might think, and probably terrible for your health.  We had the nacho tortilla chips as an appetizer. It was HUGE, not so much a fan. Also tried the clams, which were surprisingly good considering this place is the Irish version of Hooters.  ENTREES: $10 for corned beef and cabbage? Not bad at all! The cabbage was a little over buttered for my taste, but I thought the corned beef was well cooked, tender and very tasty.   Tried the fish and chips, and it was not bad. I would stay away from the chicken in cream sauce... it is way too creamy. Everything is served in gigantic portions, make sure you save half for lunch!  DESSERT: I got the Bailey's Cheesecake (would've preferred the original or Oreo), but it was still good."}
{"text":"At the Kilt pre-lubin on the North Shore before the Gaelic Storm show at Stage AE.  Drinking a KCCO Gold Lager because I've never had one before. It's tasty,  better than any domestic, but for $7.50, it's really not all that good.  Guess I'm paying for location.   The beer list isn't bad here but if your just looking to have a few before a game or a concert, I'd recommend the place next door."}
{"text":"My first visit to the Tilted Kilt was on a Friday night with a large group. So keep that in mind as you read my review. Those are not ideal circumstances for any place to show its best side.  The place is LOUD. It was nearly impossible to talk with the people sitting right next to me. Lots of TVs going, lots of different games on.  Our waitress had her hands full with our group, but did an above average job keeping track of us, keeping our drinks flowing, and ringing up separate bills for our food. The food was four-star sports bar food, mine was great and the people around me felt the same about their own food. Like all sports bars with pretty girls, the prices were a little high, but the food was good and the portions were large.  My only real issue is with the small parking lot. Fortunately, there are several businesses with adjoining parking lots close by. Going in before dark was no issue, but coming out after dark, walking around blind corners through various parking lots was not my idea of safety.   Would I return with a large group on a weekend night? Probably not. Or during a big sports event? Yes, if I was going to watch the game. But I will return to the Tilted Kilt."}
{"text":"The food is awful and has no taste.  My husband and I order a sampler platter which was disgusting and food was fried in old oil.  We old had fish tacos with nachos and they were lacking flavor.  This place looks decent for drinks but don't waste your money on food as we spend 70 dollars and didn't enjoy it or eat it.  Waitress offer different food on their menu but we just wanted to pay and leave this dive and go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Really great sports bar. Food is good, prices are reasonable and the waitresses are hot and very friendly. They even show the UFC fights, which is a definite plus."}
{"text":"Got a salad with chicken. Didn't like the dressing so decided to get ranch. Waited 15 minutes as my husband finished his food. We were never asked \"was the food ok?\".  I finally got up and asked for the check, as I was not waiting any longer. Got the check & was charged for the salad I didn't eat. Finally asked for a manager. He took care of it. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Couldn't even get our order for dinner. Waitresses all in a bad mood. Couldn't get a refill n a drink. Waited over a half hour for food that never came so we left. Oh well people around us complained about the service too. Couldn't judge the food. It never came. Avoid this place on busy Sunday nights!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas has finally caught up with the craft brew scene!  In addition to the kilt, the Yardhouse is right across the way.  The outdoor mall at The Linq is such a welcome addition to the strip  we sat at the bar and had some blackened wings and local beer .  Chris the bartender was super friendly and took  care of us"}
{"text":"Was there evening of Sunday November 6, 2016. Piss poor service sat their for over 30 minutes without being acknowledged no I'll be there in a minute would you like a glass of water nothing. I stopped the manager who had also walked by himself a half dozen times he acted as if he could care less and was a complete jerk. Needless to say I took my money else where. Do your self a favor and take your money else where."}
{"text":"This review is aimed more towards the service than the actual food. I'm 0.2 miles away at a local hotel on a business trip and they had mentioned that this place delivers. The lady that took my order told me it would arrive in 10-15 minutes, however I didn't hear from them for about 40 min so I called. The same girl answered and told me the food was on its way. When it got here, it was cold. Not warm but cold. The delivery guy had apologized and said there was a problem in the kitchen. Also, the mac & cheese bowl was maybe 30% full, which came out to about 4 bites, maybe 5. The wings & fries were good, but also cold. I'm assuming that this place is much better in person, but the delivery option was a complete fail."}
{"text":"This is one of the favorites of my group and we end up coming here almost every time we are in the neighborhood. I have always been a fan of their food as well. They have a good selection of drinks that are extremely reasonably priced too.  During my last visit to this place, we ordered fish and chips and pub nachos with chicken ( you get to choose between chicken and steak ). The nachos were delicious with all the cheese and jalapeño on top and were perfect for my taste buds that are addicted to hot food.  The fish and chips were good too. Fish was properly seasoned and was not too oily.  During our previous visits, we have tried their chicken wings, Salads, wraps but the pub nachos always get ordered  Their service is amazing and the servers should get a big thumbs up for their service. They know the menu well and make ordering food and drinks extremely easy for the customers. As it is located at a prime location and the crowd is more on weekends, there are chances of having to wait before being seated and in my opinion, that is perfectly normal.  I know we'll be here many more times."}
{"text":"My buddy and I sat at the surfboard (11/16/15) for my birthday, in the bar and waited for service or a simple acknowledgment. It never came. We had an enjoyable experience at Bettis' place where we had $200 in just alcohol, not to mention food. I could say that it was a Monday night in downtown Pit and that the area was not that busy. In my professional experience that is when you need to be fighting for every dollar."}
{"text":"You don't get enough food for what you pay (I ordered to go lastnight and 1 lb of boneless wings amounted to 6 piece of chicken the size of half your thumb). Nonetheless, the towhead girl that greeted and took my order was cool and nice."}
{"text":"Poor service-waitress more concerned about batting her eyes at male customers.  She was amazed we asked for sets of silverware and plates go along with our nachos.  This was after she hastily delivered the nachos and vanished for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Not sure why I keep going back, and no its not the girls who are always very nice. They all look like they are in high school and quite frankly are really not good servers.  Not sure they have ever been trained. The kitchen is another story.  If we have dined here 10 times, we have had 10 bad experiences.  Across the board the food is not good.  Silverware wrapped up inside my napkin was dirty.  Servers need to come back to the table and check on the order as they aren't the ones who bring it to the table. Just a hint if were still eating and you see empty beverage glasses it would be best to ask someone if they need a refill. Great new building, convenient and clean which gets them a 2."}
{"text":"Worst pub. Service was slow, and I mean SUPER SLOOOOW. In general, its not a place that I would recommend to anyone, especially if you're going with more than one person."}
{"text":"You come here for the atmosphere and the food is really good too! try the double grilled wings those our five star wings"}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant.  The gals are dressed in daisy-duke length kilts with mid-drift bearing tops.  The guys wore kilts and skin tight T-shirts.     The food is basic pub grub.  I got the grilled fish tacos -- surprisingly tasty.   The buffalo mac & cheese was pasta topped with alfredo sauce  and chucks of buffalo chicken -- great comfort food.   They make a great Bloody Mary.   There was a huge bar, booths, and tables.   The 2nd floor had more seating with a view of the bar below.   Tons of TVs perfect for watching a game or two.   Not a place that would be on my list but it's great for a group of people that couldn't agree if it's time for breakfast or lunch and what they wanted to eat!   Plus when in Vegas it's good to get out the casinos for a meal or two."}
{"text":"Just wanted to try something different and get out of the casino environment. I was starving and there was no wait so that made my mind up pretty easily. This place is on the strip between 2 casinos near the high roller ride. Plenty of seating here as it is 2 levels with a long bar in the middle of the main floor and tables and booths all around the bar. Uniforms are short skirts for the women and kilts for the men servers.  The menu was typical pub food. I thought the buffalo mac and cheese sounded interesting. It was mac and cheese with strips of chicken cooked in buffalo sauce. It was ok and alot more than I could eat. There was a very large selection on the menu so not a bad spot for a group of people with different tastes."}
{"text":"We have read lot about this place and wanted to try it before we hit a club.   First the music is really loud. You can not talk in a normal way, very noisy and its like in a club. But it was ok, dj played nice sound.   Next point we were not happy was the service. Never had that before in vegas. The girl we ordered was very impolite and seemed to be under pressure. We asked about a bucket or pitcher of beer and she didnt understand us, so we got a new service girl. Thats not really customer friendly.  Food was delicious. They serve their chicken tenders with 6 diffrent sauces and got 8 new ones. Awesome!  I will return to this place. Guess we try it for lunch midi, then it should not be as much crowded."}
{"text":"Previously the service was pretty good and as I mentioned a good selection of beers, but recently service has dropped off. The guys serving behind the bar are pretty good and attentive, but recently they have hired a few girls who are rather inattentive and don't seem to care. More interested in chatting with the guys behind the bar....  12/1/13  - service is still atrocious, but funny how one gets used to it.    So I walked in last week and thought I would see if it's as bad as ever.  Sat at the counter across from the bar as usual for approx 10 mins with the odd server walking past me without asking if I needed anything. So I do my usual and walk over and ask the bar man for a pint. Oh oh well they are not selling Boddingtons anymore - so that's a real downer. Never mind I ask for a Sam Adams and take it back to my seat, The barman says he will send a waiter over to take my food order. No one comes over of course so after another approx 10 mins I walk over and ask one of the waitresses for some fish and chips. Well I finish up my pint and fish and chips and ask for the bill. So the bill comes, but it's approx 2 x what it should be. I must say the server was very sweet, but very new and had obviously been doing this only for a few days. I wouldn't blame the server, but the totally useless management. How difficult can it be to ensure that you assign servers to each set of seats ; so that customers aren't having to hunt down waitresses?  That reminds me - I better check my credit card to see if they backed out the double charge...."}
{"text":"My service was excellent! The hostess was sweet! The general manager is doing a fantastic job of keeping this place in top shape! Nyla, Sandra, Cassiddi, Sara, and Courtney are the main reasons I come back multiple times a week! I LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had a really bad experience here since the re-opening. I came once before it closed and the food was surprisingly good, so I gave it another shot.  Service: After being seated I had to wait over 20 minutes for my server. I was close to the hostess and it was not too busy so she was thankfully observant enough to notice. I think she first tried to find my waitress and then decided to take matters into her own hands and take my drink and food order. While I was waiting for my food my waitress finally introduced herself and I told her I already ordered.  Food: Ordered a classic burger. Patty looked burnt. I really did not want to complain at this point because I was just hungry and wanted to get out of there. Unfortunately at the first bite it tasted how it looked... dry, burnt and room temperature. I asked my server about it and she said this is how they served their burgers but will take it back. On the 2nd try it still did not look appetizing but at least it was hot and not dry.  Price: Bit pricey for what you get. I hope they pay their waitresses well to justify charging 2-4 dollars above what other bars are charging.  Girls: Since this is their selling point I just wanted to point out that the girls were attractive and nice. Not sure why the service was so slow for my particular waitress but other waitresses seemed like they were on the ball.  Overall: Their main selling feature was not worth the all the negatives. If I had to recommend this location it would be just for drinks and snacks. Not for a meal."}
{"text":"Cool place but priorities out of wack. Tons of fans here wanting to watch UCLA VS. USC. But the main tvs and speakers dedicated to the SEC and whichever community college they are playing. Apparently once a channel is set, that is it."}
{"text":"I had heard of the Tilted Kilt, but hadn't realized the chain was like an Irish spin on Twin Peaks or Hooters. This location is in I guess what's called City Center, so it's a cool spot with a bunch of restaurants/things to do all in one spot. We came here for lunch, and were seated immediately. They have a full bar, and a decent food selection. We shared an appetizer sampler plate and I enjoyed the Shepard's Pie. (It was overall okay, but it's pretty classic chain restaurant food with an Irish twist.)"}
{"text":"Tilted Kilt is located in the Linq Promenade. We were strolling around looking for a snack and some good beers so we stopped in. The place is pretty nice, very big and is open to the promenade so you can enjoy the fresh air and do some people watching. Lots of TV's for catching the latest sports. And of course, the waitresses are nice to look at.   The bad part is the beer selection and the food. They have a ton of beers, but it's all the standard large brewery (12 variations of Budweiser, Coors, Miller, etc) stuff. Lagunitas' IPA was the most extreme on the menu. That's not a show stopper, because hey, I like me some Lagunitas, but the food was sad. We ordered some fried pickles to start and we got a tiny portion of pickles, spread out over the plate really thin in an apparent attempt to make it look like a normal sized order. It was like that's all that was left and they didn't want to drop more into the fryer. Pathetic. We decided not to order anything else. We split and went to eat somewhere else.   So if you just want to see some pretty girls in short skirts, maybe this place is worth the stop, otherwise walk on by and check out some of the other bars in the area. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Holy manfest '07. I think I was one of the 20 women (not including the waitresses) in Tilted Kilt yesterday. It was raining men.  And I liked it.  A few minutes after entering the bar, I knew exactly why I was surrounded by a sea of men- the waitresses were barely wearing any clothes.  Let me clarify: they did have tiny skirts on, even tinier tops and their bras were hanging out, so I guess that constitutes as clothes. The outfits were cute, but extremely revealing, so much so that even I had a hard time looking our waitress in the eye and I know the guys around me were having the same problem. The bartenders (all men) were all pretty cute. And wearing kilts.  All I kept thinking yesterday was that they must make some pretty damn good money to warrant wearing a skirt to work. The food is pretty good too and their menu is extensive.  You'll find the usual apps, sandwiches, tons of salads, chicken fingers, wings and so on.  But the real highlight of Tilted Kilt for me was when I found little purse hooks underneath the bar. I thought that was awesome.  Way to look out for the ladies Tilted Kilt."}
{"text":"Really a pretty decent place.  Lots of TVs to watch sports and happy hour has some good prices & options.   Sometimes service has been a little spotty but more for lack of experience than intent.   Great place to catch MNF."}
{"text":"Opening day, this flagship is packed. A true sports bar. This restored tower house has at least 40 flat-screen televisions some being very large displays. Not a bad seat to be had. The two story Spanish Colonial Revival Architecture and Ireland's classical Gothic themes are offered up in this structure.  First up on tap.   TK Lager, an American red lager. All malt backbone, lighter and gentle. Second beer, Kilt lifter, Scottish ale branded as an IPA but when I think of IPA I think of a loud hoppy beer. Kilt lifter is a bit sweeter malt with a hazy copper color. As a beer advocate, I prefer more of a boozy burn but these are good sippers. $5 each. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bftuYnG58kywe6FSmqMrZw?select=gGZxus2GNBMXFis6zCs9Yg  For dinner.   Old Dublin Irish Stew. Tender beef pot roast with carrots, celery and onions slow cooked in a rich and hearty Guinness beef stock, topped with a scoop of Colcannon Irish Potatoes and a side of tasty garlic bread. This was premium stew. $9. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bftuYnG58kywe6FSmqMrZw?userid=iXGoQVfBXU0CrwrRBWXozA  Day number two I decided to have the drunkin clams. These are an appetizer. Small sea shells. I didn't count them but It seemed like I had a couple dozen. They were fresh and excellent. The clams are steamed in Guinness for a quarter hour, imparting a slight bitterness to the delicious broth. $10. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bftuYnG58kywe6FSmqMrZw?select=65pVJE66sZK6Li0mgYHQlg   Every bar needs hot wings. These were meaty and very enjoyable. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bftuYnG58kywe6FSmqMrZw?select=V_IsOvyVPhaLQxjR3YecRg  This noble shelter is not what I would expect. We all were having a great time, the guys around me and the couples at the tables. I spent a couple of hours chatting away. When some good games are broadcast, this will be a great area to have some fun.   Like maybe Kentucky or Syracuse Basketball."}
{"text":"Went here with the CFD piping lot after the parade last year. Not impressed by scantily clad young women, but if that's your thing... this here is da place! The girls are very nice, the service was good, but as a middle-aged female, not my cuppa, dig? However, the Pipers...different story!!  The Flying Saucer is a lot closer, not as extreme and has a better beer selection. The food at The Tilted Kilt was better. Your call."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have ate at the Tilted Kilt. The first time was in September for a bachelor party . The service was awesome and the food was perfect. It was also nice for a crew of guys to have a little eye candy as the place has the most beautiful girls in town. This last time I was there I took my wife for a quick business meeting. My wife loved the fact that the girls as beautiful as they are where very pleasant and great servers. My wife had the pan fried steak  salad and she said it was the best steak salad she has ever had. The Kilt gets our vote ."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on Christmas. The service was quick and friendly. We ordered apps but they came out all the same time as the rest of the food. It was ok, just a lot at once and we realized we probably ordered too much! Pub pretzel with three different types of dipping cheese was huge and fresh. Fried pickle chips were good but don't eat too many as they are very salty. Fish tacos were good and plentiful. I got nachos minus jalapeño and added chicken. Had I not ordered it with chicken, there wouldn't be much left. Just cheese and not a lot of it and chips. All staff wore kilts! Good place if you like sports as it has a few huge big screens with games playing."}
{"text":"My friends are here right now one of them says the food is a four and the other says a three. Overall nice place to hangout, great atmosphere(:"}
{"text":"Visited 5.27.2012 (@2:45pm)  This is only the second time that I have eaten at this location and my boyfriend and I had pretty terrible service.  When we walked and asked if we could sit outside the hostess handed us menus and told us to sit wherever.  So we did. We sat there for about 15 minutes.  A few waitresses smiled at us but no one asked if we had been helped.   Finally, a waitress came over who didn't know the price differences between domestic or foreign beer - only new the specials.  Then she left to find out how much a Kiltlifter draft would be - $6 (kind of pricey) but my boyfriend ordered one anyways.  I ordered a bloody mary.  The drinks seemed to take a long time and the waitress explained that my bloody mary was what was holding things up. Truthfully it wasn't busy at all and the bartender should have had no problems pouring a draft beer and mixing vodka with bloody mary mix pretty quickly.  When the drinks came (brought by a different waitress) there were no garnishments for my drink.  I had to get up to get my own (no bloody mary bar either).  The food came, again from a different waitress, but we had no napkins or silverwear.  I stole one off of the table next to us and went in for another. When I asked the bartender - he told (rather rudely) a waitress to \"get her a place setting.\"  I was really appalled by the way he spoke to her.  We started eating and the original waitress stopped by to see how our meal was and the food was pretty good so we both said good.    When the bill came I was pretty disappointed that the waitress did not inform us that there would be an up-charge for sweet potato fries.  So his burger and my Caesar chicken wrap were $13 each.   Having been to many downtown restaurants where I have received great service I could not let this experience go by without saying something.  I regret not saying something at the time but the staff didn't seem to appreciate our patronage in the first place.  Go to Arrogant Butcher if it is open instead.  S~"}
{"text":"Cool location in the middle of the LINQ promenade.  If you're not familiar with the Tilted Kilt concept - it's basically the fusion of pub meets sports bar meets Hooters.  Decent service, seemed like a little better place to get a drink than a meal - decent selections of draft and fun atmosphere, lots of TV's to catch a game.  Mixed bag on the food - wings & sandwiches decent, tried a sirloin and was pretty rough, overcooked, cold side of broccoli.  Probably should have stuck with bar/pub food.  I'd be back for a game or a beer - dinner, not so much."}
{"text":"I actually like this chain but this location is the worst. Our group ordered 3 beers, 4 waters, 2 appetizers and a salad, the drinks came out in 30 minutes while the food took over and hour. One of the appetizers was just chips and salsa. The salad never came but we didn't say anything because we didn't want to wait another hour. I am only giving this one star because you can't give zero and write a review."}
{"text":"My girl friend and I came here last year at the same time the food and service was great even tho it wasn't busy we had a great time . As for this time we showed up on feb 27 it was different . Within an hour or two it really got busy and we thought that the staff was going to be short handed. Boy we were wrong , the employees just kept coming. We never had to wait for anything. We had a great time the food was amazing. I have been building restaurants for 20 yrs and the management was amazing. Two shout outs to Toby and mj ! And are great bartender Jackie! We flew from LA just for the hell of it and we will be back. Thank you from Ron and Tish"}
{"text":"Food is just average, service is pretty good, and seating is usually hard to find. Went here to watch UFC fight and ended up sitting outside - during the summer, yikes. Had one of the HUGE beers and got pretty toasted for a decent price."}
{"text":"We come in here every Wednesday for the past 4 months. Service was 5 star but it now has tapered off. Tonight we waited 15 mins before they took our drink order. So since she was already taking our order I said you know what let me order food now.... so after placing the order it took them another ten minutes to bring out the drinks. I'm very disappointed with there service. I will be giving them another chance. But I hope they will make me change my rating to a better result."}
{"text":"burgers were raw.  They charge for dressing without letting you know. fries were cold not  good customer service."}
{"text":"My first time coming here wasn't the most impressive. The service was very slow, the waitress was insulting me and flirting with my boyfriend, I ordered the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. The bottom of the cookie was completely burnt and I waited about 30 minutes for it. Needless to say, it'll take a lot for me and my boyfriend to come back..."}
{"text":"Oh, my first '1 star rating' review. Lucky me!  Such a horrid place! Sad, really sad on how these girls had to dress themselves in order to get by!  While my 'friend of honor' and the one who chose this place went out for a smoke, our table was cleared out. Seriously, how hard is it to see that the beers aren't finished and there is no paid check on the table.   Still, we got replacements, quickly gulped down new cold ones and got out. Would rather go to Applebee's!"}
{"text":"I give this three stars based on their wings which were very good. Mango habanero wings were very tasty but not very spicy. The service was also very good. Husband had pork sliders that were just average.  What turned me off was the super loud DJ music. I would have been OK with the music selection but it was so loud I had to really shout for my husband to hear me. Seems like an odd choice to have a DJ in a pub."}
{"text":"Our bartender was fantastic; however, we finally got chips and salsa after about 45min. Our meals did not come out for a long time after we spoke to a manager. We were not the only customers that waited for close to an hour for any form of food especially needing to be at a local event. Perhaps, they should schedule proper staffing in the future. First time I have seen customers leave without getting their meals"}
{"text":"DADDY LIKE.... To start off after learning several of the girls names i must say JORDAN made our visit... Not only smart and sexy she can order for you if you want. Although pretzels are my 2nd favorite thing to eat. Get there early for happy hour. YES the music is way to loud....FYI bathrooms up stairs..."}
{"text":"A great place, great uniforms, great attitudes, good food.  It's tops in the market segment of, well, the market segment of Hooter's and Tilted Kilt.  Really Tilted Kilt is far better.  The garlic fries I'm sure slapped 2 pounds on my waistline but were fantastic.  All the gals working - whatever their stage names - were positive and helped run food and provide good service.  The food was consistent over a few days too."}
{"text":"A group of us came here after an Angels spring training game and every one of us fell in love with it. I was with a group of guys drinking for 6 hours surrounded by servers dressed in short kilts, baring midriffs, and massive amounts of cleavage, of course they loved it. We came during happy hour where domestic beers were $3, imports were $5 and almost all appetizers were $5. Awesome place to hang out, drink, and much."}

I dont understand how $18 could cover 2 beers... 2 regular sized beers. NOT A FAN."}
{"text":"Great place to watch games, better than average bar food.  Service is a plus!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this chain restaurant and would be my last. Those bartenders came across no knowledge on food menu, thats not a big deal but have to wait 15 mins for beer when you sit at the bar is terrible. Then we got food, ask for ketchup was told that it behind bar but never got it have to ask again and then they slam ketchup on the bar top and yell the word \"KETCHUP\"!!!???. Order 1 beer and 1 appetizers got $70 bill and it is somebody else bill. Nobody come check back on us at all. I feel like this place is for single guy if you just go there drinking while looking at boobs that might be your to go place."}
{"text":"I wasn't eager to come back to the Tilted Kilt, but some friends insisted we meet here prior to July 4th festivities at the Regatta.  It took at least 20 minutes for our party of 5 to be acknowledged.   Beverages arrived another 20 minutes later.   Our food took an additional half-hour.   After we received our plates, we did not see our server for over 30 minutes, which translated into a long wait for refills.   Once we did get refills, we waited 30 minutes more for our check until I decided to go into the bro 'n ho infested bar to find her since she was holding my credit card presumably to prevent a dine-and-dash caper (not that I've ever defrauded an innkeeper, but...).  When I did find our server, who quite frankly was as attractive and fit as a Cabbage Patch Doll, she didn't remember our group at all, asking me curtly, \"You mean, I worked your table?\"  She had complimented me on my choice of the pulled pork sandwich and thoroughly informed one of our companions about the beer she ordered, yet she had no clue who I was.   I settled up immediately for all of us (the waitress happened to be near a register), left no tip, and bailed.   'Tis a shame for the crockpot-variety pulled pork sandwich was actually very, very moist and tasty, and the fries were even better than they were during my previous visit, but considering the restaurant's innate sleaziness  AND the horrid service, I have to give TK a 2. The Kilt was just off-kilter, and inexcusably so yesterday."}
{"text":"Food, beer, hotties in skimpy outfits. ...awesome. Irish nachos. ..interesting and tasted good. Drinks were served cold and promptly, which is a good thing. The rest of the food order consisted of calamari which was cooked right, however, a little heavy on the salt. This is for sure a nice pregame location if headed to see a ball game. I shall return. Oh and it's family friendly."}
{"text":"Don't plan to catch up with family or friends that you haven't seen in a while if you plan on getting a table.  The area is small (with high chairs) and a very loud band that blasts ear-splitting music (nice selection of music, they take requests, and encourage patrons to dance) that make conversing (unless you enjoy yelling into each other's ears) futile.    As for the food - I hated my fish and chips.  They were greasy and often fell apart or became mush when trying to dip them into sauce.  The \"chips\" (shoestring fries) were glued together due to the congealed grease.  My wife however had the Irish Dip (shaved rib eye with au jus) sandwich which she liked.    Service was attentive and attractive.  The waitress came often checking in on our drinks, although food delivery was a bit long, about a 20-25 minute wait.  There is a second story that houses small tables and a bathroom attendant scourging for tips.    We visited Tilted Kilt on a Tuesday around 7pm and were seated at a table without wait (they are on OpenTable).  Prices were $$, a nice find especially on The Strip.  Even though I disliked the food it was nice to find a place that advertised a \"Pub Fare Menu\" that actually had Pub Fare prices.    Tilted Kilt advertises itself as a \"Celtic-themed environment\" which to me sounds like they couldn't call themselves an Irish Pub along the lines of Nine Fine Irishmen (NYNY) or Ri Ra (Mandalay Bay) especially since O'Shea's is right down the Linq's promenade.  I didn't get their environment.  It was too small for a band that loud and although the prices were fair the food was not."}
{"text":"So, if your curious as to why you experience a lunch lull with a mere 32-35 patrons in your dining room establishment for an hour rotation...it probably has a ton to do with the lack of pride going into the food.  Generally I strive to only write positive reviews because a bad experience is typically the only time a consumer is driven to review at all.  But in all my reviews I rave about how an establishment works to ensure the front and back of the house are a well oiled machine. This is what breeds success in the customer service industry. However, it's very apparent the daytime staff at this location is incredibly used to the ladies on the front end picking up their slack. Coming in prepared, being prompt and addressing issues.  I can't knock someone for not having the understanding that kids food on a ticket should be dropped first because if anyone's food should be cool, it should be those who have minimal temperature tolerance. So the fact that the kids food came last and was too hot to even be handled by the adults I chalked up to the cooks not having children of their own. User error. However. The fact that all the adult food came out cold... the burgers I provided at my son's 1st birthday party were served at a reasonable hot temperature from a park grill by myself, who went to culinary school for baking and pastry arts.   Then, my guests get warm food because I value their company and understand what their presence brings to my life. However, the day shift manager was informed that the food came out completely cold but didn't address the situation at all. That was left to our waitress who had to apologize and bat eyelashes because typical lashing out at something like that would be a shit tip from a patron.   I'm watching these girls run around and do right by their tables while presumably lackluster food is being pumped out to every patron in this establishment today. Perfection isn't expected nearly as much as visible effort. And unfortunately I wasn't drunk enough to enjoy food that was as warm as bath water that has been sitting for 5 hours.  All I can say is that it starts at the top. And as a manager or a shift lead, receiving a reasonable and mildly delivered complaint and doing NOTHING to attempt to correct the situation is a direct reflection of the work ethic that trickles down through the staff.   Beautiful girls working diligently for deserved tips do not make up for a burnt out line staff that can't pump out food in a reasonable time or at a decent temperature. The entire point of consuming a meal is to have it warm. This is the basis of the \"eatery\" portion of the business and the fact that it was disclosed that a manager was back in the kitchen only makes the situation more dismal.  This is a franchised business, and sure we could stay shift managers or GMs forever, but if this was your business, you might take a bit more pride in what is coming out of that kitchen. People drink more when they eat more. But I enjoyed my singular Vanilla Swirl."}
{"text":"Decent food and beer selection and not as tacky as hooters or twin peaks but still pretty tacky and full of flesh. The salsa was really good though and the service was quite fast."}
{"text":"Made a visit for a bachelor outing that had about 10 people in our group. The hostess seated us in about 15 minutes, which was pretty good.   The food is about average to most of the franchise type places as are the prices. The staff was just about average- nothing great. They got our bills mixed a couple times but nothing too bad."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Nice atmosphere during day time hours. Plenty of TVs to watch the big game."}
{"text":"I love that Tilted Kilt has a lunch rewards program - get 10 stamps on a card for a free lunch.  They have good salads. Plus, when you add chicken to a salad, you can add a wing sauce to the chicken.  They have a great selection of beers on tap and it's easy to go here with a big group.  Make sure you check in on Yelp! to get your free Irish Nachos!  You also get a coupon for free nachos when you drop your business card in the bowl."}
{"text":"This review is for you, Laurel, the Manager on duty last Friday night. I'm going to try and keep this simple: The wings were old and freezer burnt. We said nothing. The tiny portion of rib eye on my partners Irish Dip was shameful. We said nothing. Our server, although attentive, was clueless. We asked her for suggestions to which she proceeded to tell us what to avoid and proclaimed the hamburger is her favorite. We said nothing. The odor from spilled/not cleaned up beer was overwhelming. We said nothing.   This is where you come in Laurel, remember?  My hamburger was RAW...ordered medium rare. I politely pointed it out to the server, thinking the cook may want to adjust the temp on future customer orders. The server took the plate away only for LAUREL, the manager, to come storming out of the kitchen, slam the plate back on our table and tell me there's nothing wrong with the temp, that I ordered it wrong. Instant shock. You continued to badger us and try to make us feel stupid.....you just had to be right and you were determined to make sure we knew we were wrong. It infuriated you even more when we wouldn't engage your complete ignorance and rudeness.  So nice of you to storm back into the kitchen, yelling 'fine, I'll take it off your bill!'  Guess what everyone, we never asked you or expected anyone to take it off our bill. That being said, after the way you treated us our entire bill should have been comped and you should have been fired on the spot.   Laurel, you are a big jerk and the food here sucks. No wonder everyone complains about your staffs poor attitudes. They've apparently learned their customer service skills from you.....and perhaps their cooking skills?  I don't like you Tilted Kilt. My buttons have been pushed......and I even waited a week to write this. Not so simple after all."}
{"text":"Food is great, atmosphere is pretty good as well. Biggest down fall is the service, first we received the wrong order. It then took them awhile to get our bill. Even with the bad service I'll still go back!"}
{"text":"Ladies are lovely of course. Very friendly staff. Place has tons of TVs.  Lunch business is moderate, same for noise level. There are some quite spots, high tops and low.  Decent pool table.  Worth a stop while coming thru town."}
{"text":"Have gone to this location twice and each time received excellent service and food. Girls are friendly and always seem to enjoy their job. Great menu and the onion rings are great! Also just learned that they have 40+ beers on tap! Plan to watch UFC fights here for now on! They have done a great job to earn my business."}
{"text":"A local favorite - rock solid food and service. They offer lots of specialty foo-foo drinks for the ladies. I wish their patio was a little larger for day-drinking."}
{"text":"I really was not looking forward to coming here. The only reason I came was that I was invited by coworkers and I felt obligated to go since I turned down every prior invitation to hang out with them and didn't want to be \"that guy\". (To my coworkers reading this: I don't mean I wasn't look forward to hanging out with YOU, I just meant I wasn't looking forward to hanging out at Tilted Kilt. So calm down Bart) So, maybe I'm not good in math, but I would have thought that the equation: Sexy waitresses in skimpy clothes(North Scottsdale location + cheap drinks) = douche bag central I am very happy to report that I was sadly mistaken. The bar was crowded, but not too crowded.  I could still easily walk around without side stepping or \"politely\" elbowing people to move them out of my way! The music was loud enough to easily here, yet still quiet enough that I didn't have to shout to the person next to me. The waitresses were all really friendly and attentive. The crowd was laid back and drama free. My BIG mug of Blue Moon was like $6. It was definitely good times! I look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"We came here for snacks and drinks on a Friday around noon. The wings were decent (good white meat but sauces were eh). Garlic fries were great and only $4. The service was mediocre at best. As many other reviews have mentioned, lots of people working, most just standing around.   My biggest complaint was the beer prices. Way more expensive than anywhere else on the Strip, and prices aren't listed. Want to pay $12 for a Heineken? This is your place. Our waitress was saying Vegas is cheap to live in, that she \"works one day for a bill\" and pockets the rest of that months cash. Our bill came out to $184 for snacks and a few drinks each. I see what she was saying now."}
{"text":"Their Buffalo chicken Mac and cheese is amazing one of my favorites here. The girls are pretty rad too. Good service only downfall is its a Seahawks fan bar."}
{"text":"Just walked in here all excited to get some Irish Nachos and we stood at the blank hostess desk for five minutes while a few waitresses walked around the restaurant, one hiding behind the bar who kept looking at us and not coming over. After a few more minutes and me literally doing some SOS arm-waving action, she came over to us.  By that point we were done, and she didn't seem to care at all. Didn't apologize. Just blank stare and moved on to the next person in line.  I'm all fine with bars with skimpy dressed chicks, but no burger or beer is worth that crappy of service."}
{"text":"Mostly very good bar food and a few outstanding menu items. Great for UFC fights after BWW closed down the street.  While I will always come back, some of the waitresses need to seriously check their attitudes.  While I never expect to always get a waitress that wants to sit down and chat with my boyfriend and I, sometimes I feel like I'd get friendlier service at McDonalds. It's ridiculous. One picked up our tipped check before we were done (totally rude). Alysha and one other girl were so sweet and cool, but girls like Lindsey need to have a hospitality lesson. I understand some girls that go here with their boyfriends are catty towards the waitress, but feel out your customer before giving the cold shoulder..."}
{"text":"Okay, let's get this out there and over with...there are buxom young women working here; and although they never look as good as the marketing campaign, they are indeed a distraction.  If you're uptight in any way about women being objectified for pure profit, good luck finding a restaurant in the Pittsburgh area outside of Denny's, Eat 'n Park, or Kings that DOESN'T engage in this behavior to some degree.   Now that THAT'S out of the way...it IS essentially Hooters with a Scottish tilt (see what I did there?), even though the food is Irish-flavored.  And delicious.  I had the Irish stew (yum!)on the advice of our waitress, Sam, who was incredibly cute, and incredibly young; and my wife had the Shepherd's pie, which was also to die for.  They had a  nice variety of beers both bottled and on tap (I opted for Angry Orchard on tap; liked it a lot); and the service was great (caveat:  we were there early on a Saturday evening with no Pirate game or Stage AE event); the girls were incredibly nice (given that my wife and I and one other married couple in our party were all in our late forties and early fifties greatly reduced the potential for perviness).  I could find nothing to really nit-pick about; and I didn't have ANY of the service issues that other yelpers mentioned in their reviews.  In closing, I hope to make it a regular stop when the North Shore isn't busting at the seams.  I'm sure the service could be quite a bit different after a Pirate or Steeler game."}
{"text":"Been to this location on many occasions. Its just meh in my opinion.  Let me start off with the service. I somehow always end up being there on a night when Brittany is working (i'm sure I spelled her name wrong). She is the absolute BOMB. She is very attentive and very social (and of course pretty, but isn't that one of the reasons most of us go there?). I can not rave about this girl enough. Plus she makes a mean drink, no matter what it is.  The one drink I have to recommend is the Purple Haze, (grape vodka, peach schnapps, Blue Curacao, cranberry juice, Sprite, sweet & sour). This is one of those things you can absolutely get addicted to. I get at least one every time i'm there.  The food is as mediocre as it comes though. I've only ever ordered three apps here though.   Of course I have to always order the pickles. Hand-breaded dill pickle chips served with cayenne ranch? Yes please! The ranch is probably spicier than needed, but nonetheless good. The wings are ok, but of course the garlic parm sauce makes them 10x better. The scotch eggs, ughhhh. I am glad you guys have attempted them, but just stop. I prefer to have more sausage around the egg. I prefer that my egg not be over done. It's also a plus when I don't have to fight to actually cut into the egg. I will definitely save the eggs for when i visit Pipper's.   The Irish dip is your typical dip sandwich. It has sliced beef, melted swiss cheese and au jus (which I found to be too salty). The pub fried egg burger was pretty meh. My burger came out overly done (medium rare fan here). The burger was kind of bland, but it has applewood smoked bacon, a fried egg, american cheese, lettuce, tomato and I opted out of the onion.  While a great place to get drunk and look at pretty girls, it really isn't the best place in the area to eat."}
{"text":"I always give it a day before I comment.. so here goes....  First a background. This was an EVFN event, and as seems to be the case I tend to get there first. They (Kevin) was more than accommodating in setting up tables for us, and we never really know how many show up. Tables fine.  They gave us one girl (Jennifer) who through no fault of her own got slammed. I had mentioned to them that as we are on separate tabs and we don't all get there at one the orders would be coming and going. Also the fact they had a new chef, who started a little fire in the back, didn't help.   Orders were late coming and people were quite annoyed. The nachos were ok, our table was suppose to get another order two (1/2 orders) they never arrived. The first two were ok nachos.  The only other thing I tasted was onion rings (two of them) which did have a kick to them as well as the ranch dressing dip. That I give two thumbs up.  The girls/servers obviously gorgeous and it is one of the reasons people go there. So the highlights of the evening: The two onion rings, ASU winnng the NCAA Basketball game against Washington, Jennifer who was running ragged (could maybe paid a little more attention to our end).  Would I go back is the question I guess...maybe, This place is built for nights like this...NCAA bacsketball (Local team playing), pretty waitress dressed up to make us all drink and order more... the food just not sure. The Happy Hour prices... can't complain. The last part of this it was noisy in a way where it did not need to be."}
{"text":"The place is as expected. Good looking servers, edible food. They have a lot of TVs, so it's easy to see whatever game is on. The server tasked me into garlic fries with my sandwich. They were pretty good but very 'garlicy'.  Again, if you're looking for excellent food, don't come here. But if you are in the mood for bar type food, this place is a decent spot for it."}
{"text":"This place had a good atmosphere.  The staff had Good personalities.  I would say the food was just ok.  The pretzel was good and fun to eat.  I was there because of.a nervy event so the menu was limited."}
{"text":"First time visit to a tilted kilt and I gotta say it was a good time! The beer came fast and not badly priced. Of course the view was perfect. The food was good for bar style. I had the hot cluckin mother spicy chicken sandwich and it didn't disappoint. Chicken was huge and bun was toasted nice. Fries were a bit weak is my only complaint. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Girls:  Not the place to meet your mate.   Most waitresses had huge, exposed boobs.   A hiring criteria?  Waiters duds was fine.  Interesting?  Fish and chips were way too hard."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good drink specials, lots of TV's."}
{"text":"Charged extra ($1) for thousand island dressing with hamburger. Really? Are they going to charge for ketchup too? So dumb."}
{"text":"I come here a few times a month and it has recently done a 180. The new owner Nick does an excellent job with the franchise.  Food and service is much better now and I frequent more often."}
{"text":"The quality and temperatures of the food ordered by my friends and I were across the board while the service was consistently bad.  I have no idea if this place is a chain or not but any business that hires servers on how many trashy tattoos they have or how they look in a skimpy outfit over their ability to take care of customers won't last long.   The servers seemed more concerned with flirting and taking photos with other customers or chatting amongst themselves then with taking care of their own customers.  Or is hot food, a glass of water or one refill on a soda to much to ask for?"}
{"text":"I think that the three star \"A-OK\" perfectly describes this place. It's nothing particularly special and there wasn't anything to complain about. It's well placed downtown, so it gets a decent amount of traffic. If you're hitting up the casino, this can be a good place to stop by before or after for drinks or some bar grub. Our server was timely, polite, and as professional as you can be in a plaid skirt and bra.   They have the typical list of draft and bottle beers. It doesn't seem to be any more extensive or exotic than any other restaurant. Food consists of wings, burgers, or any other normal bar food you can think of. I got something not particularly worth mentioning. Tilted Kilt helped accomplish what I wanted: a few beers, sports on the TV, and some decent food."}
{"text":"Called and made reservations for 9:15 and they told me the their kitchen would make last call at 9:45. Arrived at 9:10 and they told our party of 12 that the kitchen was closed! Not a very happy group being turned away that late! When there is a large festival in town, you should plan to stay open to accommodate."}
{"text":"Late last night after the Diamondbacks game we found everything closed and stumbled upon Tilted Kilt.  The place is outstanding.  Great food, outstanding service, awesome bloody Mary's.   Everyone is so friendly and it is an awesome place downtown to frequent.   Thank you Kaitlyn for a great visit.  Great job!"}
{"text":"As a former tilted kilt server this place was the worst!  The girls as always were nice but the manager was not very polite or even understanding.  I was not going to say anything but since I found My self back up on Friday night to Cleveland and put up in the Renaissance I thought I could correct my order from the week before.  I arrived at about 6 pm and asked if I could prior to ordering  my to go food talk about the order I placed the week before?  A manager came out and upon me explaining that I ordered the nachos which came with nothing but cheese even though I ordered chicken and beef and guacamole. In addiction to the normal toppings that come with the traditional nachos with nothing but cheese.  Again normally I would say allwell but since I found myself at the establishment a week later I thought I should say something.  The manager proceeded to judge me and tell me that I never worked for tk even though I opened the Columbus Polaris location in2010-2011 with several girlfriends who I still have to this day.  upon me sharing that I was disappointed but ofcourse always live TK I wanted the same order just right and would be more than willing to pay for it.  The manager took my drink said I appeared drunk (again at 6 pm on a Friday when my first drink was in their establishment) and that I needed to leave.  Wow because I had a poor experience and wanted to say something so that it could be correct this time around ( less than a week later?). I was kicked out for disagreeing with the manager on duty.  I will call later to talk to the GM because I have never been treated so poorly especially by a place I worked for and opened and built a voice for.  The girls are amazing as always the managers appear to not give a crap and kick people out who ask questions.    Come here for the girls but never come back if you have to deal with a manager."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar. The spinach and artichoke dip you can stay away from. I sent it back. The calamari was actually very good. For those of us who are allergic spices, the dip was ferocious! I had to ask for ranch dressing.  Shannon was very accommodating. And we got our 10% off of the bill with our Yelp check in. Gotta love Yelp!"}
{"text":"I literally just walked out without even ordering. We were sitting there for 10 minutes and no one said a word to us. Meanwhile, the guys who came in after us got their drinks as places their food orders. We asked our waitress if it was Happy Hour. She said yes from 4-7. We asked her what was on the happy hour menu, SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW! And said she would have to ask her manager. How do you NOT know what happy hour is? Was it because we were 2 females? Anyways, don't waste your time. Zipps or Native down the street are much better."}
{"text":"Wonderful, I've known for two months that the TK in PV is now \"the OU Bar\".  Doesn't do much good for those of us in Ahwatukee, Tempe, Chandler.  Didn't get the memo about the shuttle to drive us all back after having 3-4 beers.  The new OU bar in SE PHX is Philly's, at 48th St and Warner Rd. Food is better, scenery is nice, and its closer.  They have been very willing to accommodate us, even during ASU games.  Did I mention its not 20mi away for us??"}
{"text":"Stopped in to the Tilted Kilt with the wife on our way to Cirque de Soleil last night.  I was impressed with the waitresses all over in their skimpy outfits, but I was not impressed with the food.  I ordered a Guinness, which was on tap and it was good.  They had 37 beers on tap!  Love that!  I ordered the meat loaf sandwich with a side of garlic mash and the wife ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with garlic fries.  The food arrived fairly quickly.  Wife said her chicken sandwich was average.  Her fries were really greasy, but were slightly tasty.  My meatloaf sandwich was greasy and lacked flavor.  My mashed potatoes were swimming in oil!  I actually poured some of it out onto my plate.  Greasiest mashed potatoes I've ever eaten.  Greasiest meatloaf too!  The flavors were average, nothing great.  It's clear this is a beer dive meant for guys to stare at bottoms.  Reminds me of Hooters, but at least Hooters had slightly better food.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly and our orders were correct.  No issues there.  There were TVs all over to watch baseball on as well.  For the food, I will not return.  For the view of all the pretty faces, tanned skin, tattoos, and the beer, it's worth a trip back."}
{"text":"It should have told me something when, during prime bar time on a Saturday night the place had plenty of empty tables.  It should have told me something when, those tables were empty right after a sporting event across the street at US Airways Center  It should have told me something that those tables were empty on a Saturday night, right after a sporting event, AND it was St. Patrick's Day.  HUH?  They can't even fill a downtown bar on St. Patrick's Day on a Saturday night after a sporting event next-door?  Of course, if I had read the reviews here I wouldn't have tried Tilted Kilt in the first place.  The first clue was when one of our group of six, a female, went to the rest room and pronounced it \"gross\".  The second clue was the fact that they didn't quite get the fact that they are supposed to be an Irish pub and this was St. Patrick's Day.  The third clue was how they didn't even seem to have a theme, only a very weak imitation of Hooters (I am not a fan of Hooters).  Our waitress was actually pretty good.  It was easy for the 6 of us to find a vacant table and she was with us in a few minutes.  She recommended a bomb of a tiny bit of liquor and about 1/8 of a glass of beer.  No wonder she was so enthusiastic about it, they were $17 each (Tilted Kilt does NOT post prices anywhere).  We had eaten at the arena so we ordered sweet potato fries.  That was the only food we had so I can't rate anything else on the menu but they were REALLY bad, something dumped out of a frozen food bag.  Being a Saturday night, prime time, on St. Patrick's Day do you think there would be some entertainment?  No. Only canned music  Not even a touch of green to mark the day.  Is this place the McDonald's of Hooter lookalike bars?  Here is the ultimate insult, though.  One of the drinks I ordered was a Maker's Mark Manhattan.  Now, Maker's Mark is a very premium (and expensive) brand.  Any bar in the world would serve it in a nice glass.  What did Tilted Kilt serve it in?  A tiny plastic dixie cup.  Really?  Really!!!  Okay, now I see why there were so few customers and why the reviews here are so bad.  There is absolutely nothing Tilted Kilt offers to even deserve a first visit."}
{"text":"Such a terrible experience. We were told the drink we ordered was included in Happy Hour for $4 because it was made with their well Vodka, however, after ordering 4 of them and receiving our check, they charged us $7.50 per drink. When we brought it up to our server she acted dumb and pretended she never told us they were included in the Happy Hour. This was on top of our glasses all having chips in them and cutting one of our partys' lips. We were regulars, but won't be returning to this establishment after this encounter."}
{"text":"Our server stopped serving our table so instinctively I went to the bar to order a drink and she comes up to me asking if I need to order anything and I told her I already ordered my drink and she replies rudely saying \"next time order through me\". Mind you she was SITTING at one of the guests tables talking with them rather than serving us."}
{"text":"Came back here because a friend and I were look for a last-minute place to watch the game on short notice. I had been here previously for the same reason, and the experience was literally quite forgettable...until I pretty much had a repeat experience.  ATMOSPHERE:  There are lots of screens here, and a decent amount of space. Given that it's never particularly busy (for good reason), you won't need to wait too long to be seated when compared to other restaurants in the area. If all you are coming here for are TV screens and kilts, then you may not mind this place or its overpriced beer/food.   FOOD:  While the cheeseburger I ordered was actually not bad, the supposed garlic fries were cold, and ceased to have any actual garlic on them at all.   SERVICE:  On top of the server disappearing for long stretches more than once, she kept forgetting different things like drinks and condiments after being requested - keep in mind that the restaurant was fairly empty on a late Wednesday night.   Probably my biggest pet peeve regarding service, when the server does not tell you that there is an additional charge for sides...I only remembered afterward, that the last time I was here, the other server did the same thing when presenting the options for sides as standard, failing to mention the almost $5 upgrade charge! The frustration is not about the monetary value, it's about the deceit...this is exacerbated by the fact that they did not appear to even upgrade my side!  VERDICT:  If you are merely satisfied with TV's and short skirts, this place may be for you. If you actually care about food/service quality, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you like over priced food that is sub par, over priced draft beer that is sometimes cold, and service that you could get better at mcdonalds,, this is the place for you!. waitresses are not bad looking but some of them look like they came straight off the streets."}
{"text":"I came here late night with a couple friends to have a drink, eat, and hang out.  I love that they have the black bean burger to substitute in for any of the meat burgers on their menu!  The waitress/bartender we had made me a delicious cocktail, and was courteous throughout our stay.  The food was delicious, and the staff let us stay way after closing!  Thanks for helping to make my short Phoenix trip all the more pleasant!"}
{"text":"Decent service, poor food.  I got the fish and chips and it was more like fish out of the box and French Fries.  Really disappointing."}
{"text":"Always a good place to hang out downtown. Food is always good. SOB with veggie bean patty is outstanding. The Wings and burgers are a good order. Lots of TVs, they always can put on the game I want to watch. Ambiance is of your typical sports. If the weather is nice, take the patio for sure."}
{"text":"The new menu is good. Great place to watch a game, huge TVs everywhere. Overall, above average, good pub food. Inside is pub trendy, clean and well lit. Patio is nice id weather permits."}
{"text":"The absolute worse service I have had since living in las vegas 3 time there waited 30 min for a waitress just kept stareingin at us when they passed...never again don't waste your time and if your thirst just avoid it all"}
{"text":"We needed a place for a quick drink and an appetizer on a Saturday night and this place didn't have a line outside so we headed in.  For a Saturday evening, the Tilted Kilt was not exactly humming. There were a few tables being used and a number of patrons at the bar. There seemed to be only a few waitresses working, but they did not seem overly busy.  The atmosphere was pleasantly relaxed as the crowd was not overly rowdy, actually not rowdy at all.  The food was quite good and the drinks were as expected, cold and tasty.  If you are just going to ogle the waitstaff, you probably won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We stopped at the Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery for something to eat just after 10pm on a weeknight only to find out that the kitchen was closed. So we had a few drinks instead. Drinks were nothing special. The \"talent\" was also not that great. Disappointing experience overall. Too bad. It's also never great to walk away hungry. Meh."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst tilted kilt I've ever been too! The service was slow and our bartender was very unintuitive to us. He told us there was happy hour specials on Moscow's mules and when the bill came I called him out on it and he replied \" sorry, I guess it wasn't happy hour specials anymore \" also, the sampler we ordered wasn't that great either.....cold food sucks! Not to mention when you ask for a side of blue cheese they charge you for it!!!!! All the other tilted kilts I've been to have been great and don't up charge you for every little thing!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely horrible. Our waitress was extremely rude and didn't even greet us with a hello. First strike. Once we finally ordered our food, we waited. And waited. And waited. While we watched all of the tables around us get their meals... and send them back to the kitchen because they were wrong. The table directly beside us received half of their tables food while the other half had to wait because the kitchen \"must have forgotten the order.\" We were still waiting when the waitress brought out the other two meals, which the couple promptly discovered were not even cooked all the way through. The man ordered a well done burger and when he cut it in half it bled like he was cutting into a live cow, while the woman complained that her fries were still frozen. It really excited me to finally receive my food. When I saw it coming, I was just happy it was finally arriving. That was about it that excited me about this meal. My chicken sandwich was placed in front of me and the chicken was so over cooked it felt like plastic. The fries weren't cooked. My friend's burger was so undercooked I think I actually heard it moo. And my other friends French dip wasn't a French dip at all. The waitress brought out a steak sub with peppers and onions. When the waitress came over to us she said \"what's wrong\" and we promptly told her we would like to speak to a manager. Which we had to wait to do, because she was busy comping three other tables meals due to the incompetent kitchen and rude waitress. When she finally came over, the waitress also had the French dip with her and when she placed it down she said \"I was confused because you said steak.\" No apology. No remorse. It was our fault because apparently the word steak sounds like French dip. Needless to say we got up from the table at around the same time as two other tables because of this horrendous experience. When visiting Vegas again I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and dessert. Place is great with friendly service."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with service at the bar...had to ask twice for silverware after receiving my food...14 ounce beer 9 bucks...views were nice...good tvs..been to better twisted kilts around the US...this by far the worst"}
{"text":"Brought our baseball team here and had the worst service ever!! Every order was messed up took an hour to get out check! Don't recommend this place ever! Very disappointing! After 4 times finally got our bills right!"}
{"text":"Fun place to watch football as they over 20+ TV screens in this small Irish bar near The LINQ. The tater tots and onion rings are fantastic here. I found the Bostonian burger to be too greasy for my liking and it was drenched in fat and slightly under medium rare. I was disappointed that I had five onion rings to my side as those were great with Parmesan and garlic? . For a side of celery it's $1 and a side of honey mustard comes at .50 cents.  Service was subpar as we had to flag the waitress down several times to get our bill or any other sides etc."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are Amazing! As soon as we were sat someone brought us water. Then she came back and asked us about what we wanted to order.  The pub pretzel!! AMAZING!!!!!!  My husband got a classic burger which juicy and full of flavor. He really enjoyed it.  I got the Mother clucker and it was cooked to perfection! I loved it! We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Even though I feel weird all over and through this bar, it's on my list of places to frequent. They have a margarita with beer. I was sold.   The food is really meh... average bar stuff. but nobody really comes here to eat anyway, right? it's all about the half naked wait staff and the alcohol... there's pool, too. and tv. Kinda cool overall."}
{"text":"Over priced, nobody on the dance floor. Guinness is $11 and wasn't even cold. Drinks served in plastic cups. Didn't try food. Didn't stay around long enough for a second round."}
{"text":"There's nothing amazing about the place except for scantily clad women and cold beer.  OMG did I just say that!??!  That said, the food is alright for an Irish themed sports bar. You will PAY for it though. Once you have a meal and add on a few (or dozen) beers onto the tab, you just might suffer sticker-shock.   The Irish thing is done better at Fibber McGees.   I wish I could give 2.5 stars, because that's where they're at in my book. If the prices were better, I'd up the rating."}
{"text":"fun bar with female centric servers/bartenders dressed in flannel skirts that rise well above the knee and short sleeved button blouses that expose their midriffs... :)   came in during March Madness/St Patty's weekend. they had some great Jameson specials which was our draw. not the above mentioned female servers/bartenders. cool people during our visit and not too many drunk a-holes, including myself. lots of TVs to watch the games and surprisingly, it wasn't too hard to get a drink. kudos to the ladies with turning and burning those drink orders. cool spot that we'll hit up again, because of those Jameson specials."}
{"text":"Came for the World Cup insanity, so I don't think I got an accurate representation of what this bar normally is like. The bar girls have outfits that would make Hooters girls blush, and the male waitstaff wear kilts, presumably for easy access with the aforementioned ladies, since creating even a shadow of authenticity to some old-world standard is clearly not the goal here.  This definitely was the place to watch the game though, and five stars to Tilted Kilt for playing host to the ridiculous, over-the-top passion that the American Outlaws bring to a soccer party. There was a guy with a drum leading chants, lots of bros decked out in whatever spandex they owned in red, white and blue, and a few founding fathers that presumably belong to those with dual memberships in American Outlaws and the Tea Party. Generally I had a jolly good time, and I couldn't ask for a better place to watch the USMNT kick ass."}
{"text":"Stayed two nights at the Hampton Inn next door. While it's typical sports bar chain with a basic menu the service was great, Sharon the bartender was always on-time with a refill, the manager was quickly able to put up any game in progress - I got to watch my Dodgers beat the Brewers - not an easy game to find in AZ."}
{"text":"This was \"suppose\" to be the new Sooner bar after closing down the TK on Cactus. So here I am, a devote sooner fan I arrive 45 minutes early to secure a table to cheer on my boys when low and behold...mid 2nd qtr the channel gets changed to a UofA. game, what?? When we stop the manager to ask why, he tells us we can go inside or move to another table but he has to please the Washington fans (not who is on  the tv at all) or get a kimk in our necks to watch the game we came to see. Wtf? Are you serious?? Needless to say we left. Our waitress was very apologetic as were the girls at the hostess station but,  I will never return as I was not ever offered an apology by the \"less than professional\" manager but, what should I expect as I am a female in a bar who caters to men yet..I spend enough money and rip well enough that the waitress' know me. Your loss TK...I will make it my mission to find a new bar to support my Sooners and for me to spend my hard earned money at."}
{"text":"Conveniently located at the heart of Mississauga by Square One, The Titled Kilt has a prime location and free underground parking which is a plus! I had never visited this Pub & Eatery before, therefore; I was curious and excited to experience what it had to offer. I went in with an open mind and a few of my friends, before even making it to our table I instantly regretted my decision to visiting that place.  First and foremost, there was no one to greet us at the front which left us confused as to whether or not we should seat ourselves. Eventually a server came up to us and asked if we were waiting to be seated. She rapidly walked ahead of us and had us run after her like little ducks till we got to the table and were seated. She then disappeared for about 15 mins, then the same girl returned to inform us that she would be serving us. She didn't provide us with her name, specials, menus, nor even water! She then asked us if we would like anything to drink. My friends and actually had met working as wait staff at a restaurant, therefore; we are all very aware on the service protocols that apply to almost every single restaurant we've worked at. In a state of shock and utter disappointment we continued by requesting a menu, water and our choices of beer. She then disappeared once again for a good 20 minutes and returned with only our beer. We then reminded her that we still require menus and water.  Assuming that again she would take another life time before returning to our table, we decided to go out for a smoke outside the patio. With a clear view of the patio table of which we were sitting, the server poked her head outside the door and said \"Where the hell did they go?\", another server pointed us out by the patio fence. Our server, unaware that we could hear her then said: \"O I thought they dipped, I was gonna sayy..\".   Before she had even made it back to our table I went up to the bar and asked to speak with a manager. To our surprise the manager took even longer to come out of the back than our server to get to the table. But, finally when he came out I notified him with my concerns and the extremely unprofessional service we've received. Instantly I could tell that the level of unprofessionalism was directly linked to the quality of the management system. The manager seemed completely inexperienced and unprofessional. The manner in which he carried out the conversation was very coward like and unsure. He attempted resolve the issue by offering us a free appetizer, but obviously at that point it was too late to resolve anything.   This will be the last time I bother with this ridiculous place considering the horrible service I received from the waitress, bartender, the ghost hostess and most importantly the so called \"manager\" of nothing."}
{"text":"Food was fine. Service was beyond horrible. It took forever to get simple things like water, napkins, the bill....etc.   The point of this place is eye candy. (if you find this objectionable, don't go) But if you want return business, you need better customer service. Looks only go so far."}
{"text":"I was going to walk to the Chick Fil A in front of my hotel for dinner - until I happened to see the Tilted Kilt sign on the other side of the street!  i have been to several TK locations, and this one was noticeably smaller.  Still had all the typical TK decor.  I was immediately greeted and seated.  My server was very polite and conversational.  She kept a good check on me during the meal and made me feel that she appreciated me being there.  I point this out because I have not always experienced that level of service of other TK locations.  I ordered the Fried Egg burger with fries.  It was prepared medium well, which gave it just the right burger flavor for me.  Fried Egg was just the right topping.  Overall a very pleasant meal."}
{"text":"Since Raleigh will be getting its own Tilted Kilt in 2012, I decided while I was in the area I should check it out.  Certainly an attention getting outfit for the waitresses!  Our server was attractive and pleasant.  Along with providing the daily specials, she gave a nice suggestion to me on a special \"Farmer Ed's\" (I think) Burger which included a fried egg on top, which is what I ordered. The burger came with fries and a pickle.    I ordered the burger well done, and I probably should have requested it medium well.  Thought the burger overshadowed the fried egg on top, but I liked the taste of the burger.  Would have appreciated a bit more interaction from the server.  I am sure she was respecting that my friend and I were having a conversation, but they were not that busy and a bit more presence on her part would have been a good thing - especially since I mentioned this was our first visit and I wanted to see what the place was about."}
{"text":"My brothers and cousins had heard about this place from a friend so we decided to give it a try. We came in on college football day. The atmosphere is friendly and energetic. Each tv had a different game on it and that's a huge plus. We all ordered various burgers and beer. The food was served hot and promptly. The staff was courteous and very inviting. The burgers were amazing. I really didn't think it would be that good but to my surprise they were cooked just right and had the perfect flavor. I'll definitely be coming here again in the future."}
{"text":"So the place is now really run down Dirty napkins on the floor Men's bathroom was half broken. Wings were stingy on sauce They messed up one of our orders and the manager was to chicken ..... to come talk to us, he tried to have the poor waitress pawn off the messed up order so he would not have to COMP it. We will not be back to this tilted kilt. The real bummer is we drive from Tonopah to have to signature winGs and they were just OK"}
{"text":"The wings and bar tender is hot but supposedly there US a 5 beer and drink limit???  We will go somewhere else tomorrow after  training"}
{"text":"Great location on the Linq promenade, good food, cold beer, friendly staff, 50 TVs for the games, and they let you bring in the daiquiri you just spent $15 on outside. I'm starting to make this place a go to! An all around top notch sports bar!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, many choices of beer (if you don't consider that biermarkt is just a few doors down) and some pretty revealing uniforms. All that being said, the food was crap. Burger was overdone and very salty (I only ordered it because of how good the waitress said it was) and fish tacos were very subpar (she also said those were one of her favourite things). Would go (and have gone) back for drinks, but definitely not to eat."}
{"text":"Decided to come here to watch a game because they said they'll play the audio for the game. That's a differentiator when choosing a sports bar. More sports  bars should do this. Unfortunately, in the 2nd half, a live band showed up and killed the mood. The game audio was turned off and the music was so loud, we couldn't talk to each other anymore. We left shortly thereafter because of the live band. Wish we had been told the audio would only be played for the first half.  Ordered mozarella sticks, onion rings, and tater tots. They were good.   Ordered the skillet cookie and it was gross. I have a sweet tooth and love pizookie desserts. I'd never eat this one again. The ingredients and/or recipe need work. Oregano's has an excellent one.   Overall, a mixed audio and food experience. Service was good."}
{"text":"Because of the beer specials and the great treatment by the bartender I came back here on Sunday to catch the NFL games.  I didn't bother asking the servers where my game was being played, but found it on my own.  On Sunday they have the TVs labeled with the games shown.  I sat down right in front of the TV showing the game I wanted to catch.  The bar was about 1/3 to 1/2 full.  I waited to get served, but the waitress in this area didn't stop by.  I waited for a couple of minutes when I saw the bartender from Saturday.  She was waiting tables today and came on over.  She remembered me from the previous day.  I ordered a Guinness, still only $4, and asked if they had the $5.99 wing deal again.  She said that was just on Saturday's, so I got the pound of wings with fries again.  This time I ordered Titled Wings instead of the Kilt Burners.  I double checked that these were more of a Buffalo style sauce rather than the habenero sauce.  My beer and wings came out quickly.  The Tilted Wings were more what I like.  They were cooked well and the fries were hot and crispy still.  Not the best wings I have ever had, but very high up the list.  The service was good, not hovering, but making sure I had what I needed.  This visit just reaffirmed that the Tilt Kilt is a good place to catch a game and have some good food."}
{"text":"Was meeting a friend of mine and he was hungry. This was the only place that was open at the time and still served food. He got the wings and loved them, i got the stew and it was pretty good. He had a few beers and I had a Macallan on the rocks. It was a chill late dinner.  Oh, and the scenery was definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection on draft and their are a lot of well placed large TVs to watch games. The food is what you would expect from a corporate theme restaurant. Do yourself a favor save your money for good beer and stick with something that most kitchens can't mess up like wings and burgers if you aren't too picky. If you are looking for great wings though, head over to Wing King next door. Then come back for better beer and better TVs."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for a drink after touring the ball field and I would definitely come back if we come back to Pittsburgh in the future. The staff was really friendly, outfits were nothing worse than Hooters so that didnt bother me. Our waitress Missy was really nice to our son, hooking him up with the chocolate milk he asked for. We were treated like locals, warm and friendly. It was a great experience that I would recommend to anyone visiting the city."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale from California with some friends to catch the end of Dodgers spring training and to get in a couple of rounds of golf.  We came here wanting to watch the Lakers game, but unfortunately, they don't have the NBA package so we had to settle on watching the Suns game on ESPN.  My friends and I ordered the fried clams, a salad and three burgers.  We all thought the food was good as well as the service.  Drinks were tasty and our server Heather was very attentive and was always coming by to make sure we were well taken care of.  We'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the only bars/restaurants in CityScape that offers discounts to college students; brownie points for Downtown TK. The negative reviews here are mostly without any merit."}
{"text":"Embarassed I went in.. what a hack job!  All dudes other than the waitresses, btw. The shorter the skirt the higher the price."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite on my lunch break today. I ordered the Bad Arse BBQ burger. It was really delicious and flavorful and will definitely order it again. The only downfall, was it took roughly 15-20 minutes to receive the burger and fries. With an hour lunch break, you kind of want something quick and that was pushing it. Overall though, servers were friendly, the manager stopped by to say hi, and the establishment was very clean!"}
{"text":"They are trying their best to give great friendly service and they do well doing it. I have to give them props for that. but thats where it stops. The food and the atmosphere is not my thing. I will hang out at Hooters at the AZ Center any day overt the Kilt. I wonder how long they will be around with the NBA season being cancelled. Wish them all the best as I support downtown business."}
{"text":"Great location for a sports bar, but the atmosphere is odd. Mediocre food and service."}
{"text":"I came back here after not coming here for a few years because I felt they let the quality drop and it is a drive.  I went back recently because fellow Sooner friends were going and I thought I'd give them another chance because it had been so long.  I ordered the same steak salad I ordered the first time I went here.  It was great.  The greens were very fresh and the steak was very tasty and not tough at all.  I like the marinade they had on the steak.  Before the steak I ordered the meatball and sausage appetizer which was also tasty.   My friend got on order of fries and it was a huge order.  They were very good and crisp, did not get limp.  The onions were not bad either, not greasy at all.  They were very busy because of all the football fans there.  They also were showing Washington State game too so many of their fans were there too.  Despite being busy they were ready.  No issues with service.  We switched tables when more friends showed up and it was no problem tabbing out and moving to the other table.    There is also a large outdoor bar area with plenty of TV's too for the nice weather."}
{"text":"Good food and service.  We were a table of four prior to seeing a concert downtown.  The place was packed but our server was still very attentive.  If I had one know it would only be that the bar drinks were a bit slow but as I said before they were very busy."}
{"text":"This place was awful after a spring training game stopped by. The service was OK she did forget a thing of fries.  But the food was awful cool wings and almost an hour wait. Not worth the money or time"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. However over the past year or so I think the quality of food has been going downhill tremendously. The beer prices are definitely would keep me coming back it's not everyday you can get a craft draft for $2 depending if it's on the list at that time or not. The food portions are very well still overpriced for what you get. The girls make the Establishment what it is and have the guys coming back, as I stated I've been down there plenty of times and the waitresses are phenomenal with their hospitality and knowing their customers week after week. I will probably go back again just to get away and have a good drink"}
{"text":"Went to the Tilted Kilt after the second session of the NCAA Wrestling Tournament last weekend. I waited in line for over twenty minutes to get in and I waited over twenty minutes to get a drink. I tried the Purple Haze and paid a premium for something I didn't want to finish. It took another ten minutes to get a beer to wash the disgust out of my mouth.   Given the event going on at the Q I think management should have more bartenders and service on the floor. I can't fault them for the line at the door because they have to follow code but I do blame them for the slow service time and for not getting a beer faster when I poured out a mixed drink.   I have been here a couple summers ago before a Tribe game and had much faster service, no wait to get in, a decent meal, and a much better experience. I don't want to dissuade anyone from going here as you may have a much better experience when they are not as busy or better staffed. At the same time be warned about wait times when they are busy and use the line at the door about what you may experience when you get inside."}
{"text":"Amazing, personable service with a smiling and friendly staff! Emilee was new (we were literally her 1st table as a TK waitress), but she was very knowledgeable of the menu and had excellent  recommendations. Even with our (*ahem) high-maintenance order, the food came out quickly and accurately.  The BBQ bacon cheeseburger gets an A+ ( make sure to try the \"Kilt Burner Mayo\" with it) and Fried pickles (also an A+) were both high points, and the Highland sampler platter was a hit as well (A-). The only knock on our dining experience at all was that we LOVE spicy, and the hottest hot-wing sauce Tilted Kilt had seemed to be hot for flavor, not for downright heat (B-).  Definite additional honorable mention needs to go to our waitress who basically made the experience - Her attentive 5 star service was awesome.  She was observant of our table's needs, yet mindful of not interrupting our ongoing conversations.    Overall - Wow, this is an amazing place with great food and exceptional service...  A must-stop the next time we're in town, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Aside from the T&A show we all enjoy from the severs, which I admit is a draw, the food quality is only fair to average and nothing to write home about. Will I visit again? Hmmm, most likely not. I think a one and done is about all it deserves. It's not terrible, but not good enough for a follow-up."}
{"text":"It might sounds strange.. But I have been waiting for Tilted Kilt to open for months! And I was glad they finally open for real.  I am not here for the girls and I know it is just a little awkward for them to wear that \"uniform\" for work that makes Moxie's waitress uniform looks conservative. But the draft beer selection is the best in the area.  I don't mind being surrounded by monitors of all sizes and I do enjoy watching sport games with a beer or 2 with friends.  Suggestion: They really need written down list of what beers they have on draft on a chalkboard or whatever. This is just not professional when the wait staff does not even know what they have?!  I will be back for a drink for sure and maybe even try out some of the food.   BTW, there are also some waiters in kilts too but nothing compare to what the waitress are wearing..."}
{"text":"Both times that I have been at here the service always starts out great and once the food comes the waitress is gone,  but the food is really good."}
{"text":"I don't think there was any good thing that happened at this visit. On Sunday we came in a with a decent party and we're sat right away but once we were sat it took about 20 mins for a server to come to our table to ask if we wanted anything to drink. As the rest of party came in the wait time was drastically increased as to how quickly she came back to our table. From us ordering our drinks it took almost 30 mins to get a beer because they were out of so many different ones. We did express our concerns to the manager and it took another 30 mins to get our food order started. From there it went down hill even more. Orders were not taken correctly food took way to long to come out a member of the party even ended getting her food after everyone else had already finished. After we expressed our concerns to the Manger the server was removed from our table. We were told our meals would be comped as we were there for 2 hours and and hour and a half of it was just waiting for food or drinks. When we asked for the bill it took another 30 mins to get all of them which our meals were definitely not comped for what so ever and not even a discount was given or even an apology for slow service. I would definitely not go back to this location if it's always gonna to be 2 hours for food and drinks and horrible wait service. If I could give this no stars I would."}
{"text":"Great food, I had the California turkey burger with fries. Girls are hot, beer was cold, service was excellent and the price was even better."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Father's Day.  Quick, friendly service.  I had the breakfast sliders - pretty good.  My husband, a vegetarian, had the tater tots and our son had the chicken fingers.  Would probably go back. A bit difficult for us short folks to sit comfortably in those high bar stools."}
{"text":"Will put a review in since I was there the other day for a lunch meeting... this place is what it is... a variation of a hooters, but the girls seem to be younger... I like the esplanade and its convenient to the downtown area... as for the food, typically pub fare. On a positive note, it is newer so everything inside is quite clean and new and found the girls to be quite friendly."}
{"text":"Visited here on Nov. 20 with the sole purpose of watching the Florida State-Maryland game that night. Lots of TVs, but when my friend and I -- seated at the bar -- asked if one of the TVs in front of us could be turned to the game, the male bartender told us he couldn't because someone had requested the Mississippi State game. We looked around and no one was paying attention to the TV. We just moved to another pair of stools closer to the Maryland game.   Food was typical. Sliders basket was good, but the potato chips were even better. The 20-ounce TK Lager was OK, but I thought the Fat Tire beer I ordered afterward tasted better.   Waitresses are dressed like scandalous Irish girls. Kind of like Hooters but without the good wings or burger specials."}
{"text":"Yikes. My group of 5 came in after the suns game, and the immediate feeling was unwelcoming, as if we were a burden to come spend $160 in this establishment. We were unsure of the plans for the night; just a group of guys out for a bachelor party. We told the host we'd probably just get drinks. We decided after waiting 15 minutes for our drinks that we should probably eat. Our server was busy it seemed so I asked the hostess if she could put a food order in. She asks the manager and she takes my order. Didn't get anyone else's. Finally the server comes by and she has our drinks. (It felt like 25 minutes, but I know it was probably around 15). I let her know I gave the host my food order since we decided to eat and she looked busy. NOW. Here is the best part: she literally stops moving. Turns her head and gives me the dirtiest glare I have ever seen! I thought I was being helpful but once again, an unwelcoming feeling bestowed our table.   We ate our food, drank our 1-round of drinks (could have been 3-4) and left.   I don't think I'd ever return to this place."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here for dinner my first night in Arizona. The food is okay. I got the grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad. The salad was huge but there was nothing special about it except for the fact that I got to choose what kind of dressing I wanted (yay!) The sandwich wasn't all that. Way too salty for my liking. My friend got a burger cooked medium-rare and he only ate half of it (must've been bad)... Barely even ate the fries on his plate.   The service is okay. Hello, scantily clad servers! Definitely do not recommend this restaurant for families. We got in around 930-10ish and it straight up smelled like a bar in there (yackfest). Not a pleasant smell to enjoy your dinner in. Other than that, I think it'd be a cool place to grab a few beers with the homies. Not dinner though, I'll pass. Slightly overpriced in my opinion. Meh."}
{"text":"Came in while walking the Linq Promenade and sat at the bar.  Had a few Black & Tans plus some appetizers such as the chicken spicy dip, hot wings and pulled pork sliders.  The chicken and cheese dip was good with crispy potato chips. The wings were a nice size but were not as hot as I thought they would be. The pulled pork sliders were not good at all, passable really.  The females working the bar were attentive and nice, as for the people dropping off the food,well they need some lessons on how to address someone if they ordered food and a simple hi excuse me, just don't slap the plate down and walk away.  Hope to be back in the future."}
{"text":"It's a Friday night and you want to watch your favorite sports team on a big screen with 10 of your friends.   This would be the place for it.   The waitresses dress in a red plaid kilt, white shirt and matching plaid bra.   There was one waiter who wore a black kilt. It was nice to see they have both waiters and waitresses that dress in kilts.    I went with a group of 25 plus for #EVFN and our waitress was wonderful, considering she kept on top of all of us and a few other tables inside and out.  She was very pleasant and how she kept track of everything I'll never know, but she was astounding once I realized all of the things she was doing besides waiting on all of us and getting our bills straight at the end.   Kudos to her, I believe her name was Jenna or Jenny.  The reason I didn't score higher because I felt we really needed more than one waitress for our large group.     I ordered a personal pizza and pear cider.   The pizza was okay, not the best I've eaten but pretty good for bar food.  And I can't complain about the price either as I would have paid more at other establishments in the area.   Parking there is an issue as the place was packed and so was the parking lot.  I was lucky enough to get a spot close but others in our group had a to park a lot farther then they would have liked to.  The sports bar itself was extremely noisy and I'm not sure what they could do to buffer it.  I've been to other sports bars with just as big of crowd and it was never as noisy as this place was.    All in all, it wasn't a bad experience but I don't think I would go back unless there was a sporting event I wanted to watch or a group of friends were going."}
{"text":"Visited the Tilted Kilt for their patio party, had an awesome time, Erica took excellent care of us and was very pleasant to be around. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"I'd rate this restaurant at 0 if I could but because I can't I'll give it a one star. The service was mediocre-at-best whereas the waitress was more interested in her cell phone than and taking care of us. In addition there was a young man at the bar using foul language very loudly and they had a hard time controlling or changing the atmosphere to our satisfaction. The food was average at best.  We won't be going back. The assistant manager didn't even offer a discount to take care of the issues. Upon our request he presented a very modest discount. Nothing compared to the challenges we faced in his establishment.  I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"setup is so awkward. service is o-----kay.. i guess food is not the best.."}
{"text":"Food was great and they were able to accommodate my gluten free diet even though they had nothing designated GF on the menu. Service and hospitality were excellent. Bridgette joked with us and made everyone smile even when we had to wait a little for our food. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have had problems everytime I come here, first time, they overcharged me (didn't find out until I looked at my bank statement, they charged more tip then I wrote down.) second time they overcharged my drink, there is a difference when I actually say 'happy hour drink' and they still charge me full price. They also changed the menu and made my fav thing a smaller portion. I will continue to go to arrowhead tilted kilt where I have no problems!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give half stars, but rounded my score up.  The restaurant is another take on the scantily clad waitress restaurant idea...nothing special.  Ordered the shepherd's pie which was decent, however for the price, I would expect a bigger portion.  It could also stand a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor.  Our waitress was Cami and she was very attentive and polite.   Overall it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger to go around midnight.  Ordered it medium rare but it came a cold side of rare.  Burger was seasoned well enough and seared well on the outside that this wasn't a problem and was quite good.  Just to be in safer side order medium to medium well.   Staff were very nice!  I should have stayed for a drink.  Definitely would go again."}
{"text":"Jack and Dom were two cooks that serviced us personally. We just happened to sit in front of them for a few cocktails. They were so personable and really exceeded customer service expectations. My husband and I both have worked in the food industry and were so impressed by these cooks' engagement. They were invested in our experience and personal interests--and that's not the cooks' job! They deserve all the gold stars and a raise/promotion. I would return to Tilted Kilt just to see these two cooks!"}
{"text":"We were like 2 of 8 people in this restaurant and it was still the slowest service. They also messed up my order since I got a burger I didn't even order. It was a simple order that the waitress wrote down wrong. This place is overrated for the \"perks\" of seeing women in little uniforms. Nothing can salvage this place that makes it worth a visit."}
{"text":"I do not feel bad for looking at the young girls. I actually feel good. They better enjoy all the creepy eyes on them while they can. Looks don't last. Why am I even typing? Townes Van Zandt said it better on \"Catfish Song\":  Well, all you young ladies Who dream of tomorrow While you're a listenin' These words will I say Cling to today with it's joy And it's sorrow You'll need all your memories When youth melts away."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give the Kilt one star is because they have a decent beer selection. This is your basic sports/ \"lets meet here before the game\"/ \"hey check out the rack on that one\" (and I don't mean ribs!) kind of place.   Lots of burgers and sandwiches on the menu, being a health conscious eater it was hard to find something I was in the mood for and settled on a salad, meh. Not something that goes good with an IPA. Me thinks not as a true Yelper might say. I could return if every other bar on the north shore boards up and closes."}
{"text":"We just can't really win with Tilted Kilt. For a Saturday night, it was super dead. While the server was nice, the service wasn't that great and because the kitchen was closing, the food was put together sloppily. Everything felt really rushed even though it was only 10:00 on a Saturday night.  Toward the end,  a huge piece of dust fell from the ceiling onto one of the plates. The manager took off that meal but then gave them a bill for the $2 soda. The server watched us as we viewed our bills and it seemed a little odd."}
{"text":"Our server \"bunny\" did not crack a smile the entire time we were there. Not pleasant or nice. A real buzz kill.  The happy hour was terrible. $4 for ONE pulled pork slider. $4 each! $7 for a couple nuggets of battered chicken. The $4 pulled pork slider tasted microwaved and came completed wrapped in paper like a McDonalds burger, only much smaller.   The kilted patty melt was supposed to come with grilled onions...onions were prob grilled for about 6 seconds and were still raw...bleh!!   Big pet peeve...spending a lot of money on crappy food and even worse service. Boo"}
{"text":"Bartenders were awesome and very attentive to us.. the food was decent for a chain place... The only thing I didn't like was the bar smelled like stale beer so it def needs a good deep clean."}
{"text":"Start with the positives the food was great.  I had the pulled pork mac and cheese it was delicious and so were the fried pickles appetizer. If you don't like spicy food don't get the pickles though.   Now for the bad. We waited to be seated for 15 min and still weren't seated. So we went to the bar and told the bartender we were going to seat ourselves. The waitress was terrible only came back once for a refill. At the end of our meal she came back three or four times to see if we had paid our bill yet. Then sent another waitress over to get her tips from us. They also shut the lights out on us I guess to tell us time to go.   I was not impressed at all with the customer service. Most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Hoh My Goodness.   Where to start. Well, I do have quite possibly the best photo EVER from my visit there.  I've got Charlie's Angels by my sides. I mean, if there were four Charlie's Angels. And if they wore the itsy bitsy outfits the gals do at Tilted Kilt. (I may need to tack the photo to my gym log book as a motivator. Damn them!)  The kids that work there have boundless energy and seriously know their beer. Our server was very well versed in the food menu as well. She was quick to take an order and turn it around.  Additionally our server knew the Phoenix downtown area really well. I live in Arcadia and am just getting to know downtown. I was around the corner for an event and had come over for a drink. With her boundless energy it was (beyond) easy to stay drink and be merry!  (I'm going to have to come back and fill in our super awesome server's name. I don't have it handy right now. If you do look at my photo - it would be the brunette closest to me. The photo I'm referring to is in my profile photos. Not in the business photos.)  The only ding - and this isn't actually a ding - I would give to my server is her boundless energy. Good lord! I think she must have Monster Energy Drink pulsing thru her veins. That one can talk forever and not be tired. Truth!   The thing is - she's super cute! Not annoying. Very entertaining. I definitely have to find out her name so you can meet her too!  If you like to drink (and who doesn't?) beer this is a good place! Ok, and the outfits probably don't hurt business either ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped in after the Arizona Diamondbacks game with my son, and had a couple of drinks and an appetizer. We came in with a couple of souvenir cups from the ball game and forgot them at the table when we left. My son has Asperger's Syndrome and was very upset when he realized he left them in there.  Came back, the hostess try to help us find them, then the manager came over and help search all over the place for them. As we were walking out the manager came running up with the cups.   They couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone that goes to a Diamondbacks game."}
{"text":"So I  do not ever think I have given such a low review on yelp before.  I have been in my share of tilted kilts on the eastern portion of the U.S. and I don't think until last night I walked into one so dirty, and unorganized. I had to wait to be greeted by the hostess when there were 3 tables in one of the largest tilted kilts I have ever been in.  After I was seated it took the waitress, who I can after the initial delay was very pleasant, about 8 minutes to greet me at my table.   Watching the staff interact with the little customers they had was very poor. The male bartender was more concerned with his mobile phone then making sure his station was clean.  The manager of duty was to busy socializing with a friend then to table touch or even say have a great night when I intenally walked by him.   The waitress Harley even though we started off in a rough track was very pleasant and met the standard of what I  expected walking into a TK."}
{"text":"As I am a frequent flyer of tilted kilts across the United States with my travels.  I recently moved back to the Vegas area.  Even though the reviews were not great, it is always worth one try at a tilted kilt.  Greeted by the young blonde  hostess, who was very pleasant and talkative.  Sara our waitress greeted our table promptly for our drink order.   As I ordered a pulled pork sandwich no cole slaw, the response I got was they might still put it on, not a good start to this experience. As our food came out promptly the portion of French fries was smaller than expected, or what I should say not what I'm used to. You could tell they placed Cole saw on my plate, but then removed it.  The waitress was not attentive, I felt she was too worried about rolling silver then worrying about her tables.   Not once did she socialize with any of her tables that I could see.  Not once did I see a member of management table touch, he was walking around looking busy.  As the food was not up to par with what I have had or expect from a TK, this place will not be on my list to take friends and family when they visit."}
{"text":"So I walked into the TK after settling into my Hotel.  I was a bit concerned with the staff, but I can say the hospitality was out of the world.  Between the server Lexi and the back of house manager who table touched and had struck up a conversation with me.  As I was not impressed with the new two sides pub style menu it had some great new items on it.    I would recommend this TK to anyone visiting the Pittsburgh area and I will be back before my visit ends."}
{"text":"For a place on the strip,and the high prices you'll pay, you'd think you would get a good experience while dining here. My boyfriend and I attempted to eat here last night while we were staying at the Linq. We came in and sat down at the bar. After about five minutes a bartender finally acknowledged us, got us drinks & handed us menus. No one ever spoke to us again until my boyfriend had to ask for the tab over 25 minutes later. The two bartenders on duty were even serving the men sitting next to us- but not us. We were fully expecting to eat meals and get a few more drinks, but unfortunately the terrible service made us ask for our tab and leave, very disappointed. I will not be returning to the Tilted Kilt. I don't like dining somewhere where you get ignored."}
{"text":"The food here was only ok. The service was good, our waiter was nice. My pizza flatbread wasn't that good I ended up giving it away. It's your average bar kind of like a knock off hooters. I most likely won't be back and if I am its for the free Irish nachos."}
{"text":"Sorry Tilted Kilt.   We stopped in for a pre-concert meal. It took 20 minutes for our first drink. Then 50 minutes later when we asked (for the third time) of our meals were ready - nachos and a pound of wings - we were asked \"do you want to cancel the order\"?  No. We would like to think a restaurant in the concert area would be able to serve  nachos and wings in less than an hour.   I'm not a high maintenance customer but seriously, I could have made this food quicker at home."}
{"text":"I did not know that Vegas had one of these pubs in their area now. We were looking for a place to watch the World Cup and this was the nearest spot. I wasn't expecting to find a seat being that the game was about to start but to our luck there was one table left by a projector screen. Every TV had the game on and the surround sound was turned up loud. I love it when restaurants do that!       The service wasn't as slow as you would expect for a World Cup, but my beers did take a minute to come out, but it was no knock on our waitress, she was awesome. For food I ordered the spicy chicken tenders, which on their menu, was listed as one of their fan favorites. It comes with cole slaw, fries, and their spicy sauce.... hardly spicy at all. The meal itself wasn't very large but it was filling.         The one thing I hated about this place is the restroom. It's located upstairs and they are very small. Imagine having to go to the bathroom (#2) all the way upstairs just to find out someone is in there then have to walk all the way back and wait. That didn't workout to well for me. I would recommend walking over to the O'sheas Casino just outside the pub. There are plenty of clean bathrooms there within walking distance and no incline."}
{"text":"OK this is a Scotish/Irish pub. It's a sports bar through and through. The menu is typical tailgate fare with a few good entrees. This place is large so there is plenty of room to watch your favorite team. It has a deck that allows for smoking which thrilled a few of our group. Our experience was OK. The staff was friendly but one gets working on Sunday night they get tired and/or bored. The staff is dressed in kilts, imagine that. The guys were a long kilt and the gals. Well red tarting micro-kilt, push 'em up tartan \"bra\" and button down shirt tied up. Heck look at pictures. I'll add my own soon. It's not a bad spot to watch sports and have cheap food. oh they have a ca lander of the gals."}
{"text":"it is ok restaurant,  overpriced and girls are cheap looking with their skimpy outfits  not necessary . .or suitable for kids...girls put more clothes on !!!"}
{"text":"You pretty much know what you're going to get here even before you walk in the door.  Under-dressed wait staff, below average food, and overpriced beer.  This place didn't disappoint on those expectations either.  I'd have given them a higher rating if the talent level was better, but it just wasn't there, on a Friday happy hour - which should be the creme de la creme.  My wings were not crispy like I ordered and did not have much flavor.  The beer was cold - yay.    I'm not sure why you would come here to be honest, there are better sports bars all over Matthews/South Charlotte - you can do better."}
{"text":"This place has four GIANT flat screen TVs in the bar.  Amazing set up, except the seating gets really crowded and they really need more.  Food, drinks, prices etc are all pretty average for a bar.  Obviously most people come here for the waitresses and their outfits though."}
{"text":"First off, anyone looking for a Washington State University WSU bar, this is it!  You can watch all the Cougar Football games here with the sound on and other Cougar fans.  I really enjoyed the time we had here.  Service was outstanding, food was excellent, view of the TV was good, sound was good, etc."}
{"text":"Well since I didn't get a chance to order even a water within the ten minutes I sat waiting for a server to even acknowledge my table I'm going to assume that their food and drinks are as poor as their service.   Ive worked in the industry in a very busy establishment in another state and we are often understaffed but we always greet our new patrons and take at least a drink order within five minutes (at the most). We made eye contact with three servers and not even a hello. I got it, Thursday at like 9:30 is like the busiest time at a restaurant  (chris said sarcastically) but give me a break. Disappointed in all aspects.  I'm updating this because shortly after I wrote this review I received a message from the manager. He was extremely professional and I felt like he honestly wanted to rectify my experience. While my first review won't change I want everyone to know that their management takes the time to read these reviews and obviously takes them seriously. I respect that."}
{"text":"Came here for the homie's birthday and I wanted to see what all the hype is about this place.   I see why the fellas like it so much. It's like an Irish hooters. Girls in skirts? What's not to love. Haha.  So since it was a Friday and I couldn't eat meat I ordered the Quinlan's five cheese flat bread. I saw that it had a basil pesto sauce and thought yes please! Lol. I was disappointed. It was sooooo bland. Like really bland. =/   Drinkssss... I ordered the Celtic crush. A different waitress brought my drink. When I tried it, it was extremely sour. Our original waitress came and said she  noticed that my drink didn't look how it should've. So they made me a new one. It tasted like a screwdriver. Lol. The second drink was a purple haze. Wasn't a big fan of that thing either.   To sum up I wasn't a fan of the food and the drinks weren't anything special. Not to mention parking is horrible!!! I drove around for 20 minutes looking for parking and ended up paying like $15. You'd think they would have their own parking but they don't. I probably wouldn't come again on a normal day. It's a cool place to hang out with the homies though to watch a game or to stop by after the suns game."}
{"text":"This Tilted Kilt is alright...this is more like a 2.5-star review. They have happy hour every day from 4-7pm....but no mention of the specials from either the waitress or menu. Kind of weird, but whatever. Speaking of which, the menu had an insert left over from St Patrick's day.   I've been to the Tilted Kilt in N Scottsdale and I've never been really impressed by the talent at either location. There's usually only 2 attractive girls out of 6-7. And they really should not allow girls with flabby bellies to wear skimpy clothing. In my not-so-humble-opinion. The problem with Arizona and this country now is that any chick under 140lbs is considered \"hot\" which is really fucking funny.  The TVs here are projection/15-ft variety which are fairly sharp and add a nice touch. And the bar gets packed for sporting events. But $25 after tip for 2 Miller Lites and a qeusadilla seems kind of high. A Miller Lite draft costs $5 for the largest or $12 for a pitcher. Why not sell a 32oz draft for six bucks? Tilted Kilt is alright but in this economy, I'd rather hit up a real sports bar or a shitty dive if I'm slumming it."}
{"text":"I am actually shocked that this restaurant doesn't have a 4+ star rating on Yelp. I feel like I'm a pretty picky/opinionated person with high standards for restaurants and I was floored by the food and service at this place.  My girlfriend and I came stumbling in here after a show at the Brooklyn Bowl. We were both amazed by how good the food was. I ordered a flat bread pizza and my girlfriend ordered buffalo strips. Now, flat bread pizza and buffalo strips are staple crops to our diets (sadly) and we've eaten a lot of pizza/chicken in our lifetimes. That said, the pizza was absolutely delicious and the buffalo strips were, hands down, the best buffalo strips we have ever had.   While I am not a fan of restaurants that have their waitresses dress a little skimpy, the service at this place was great as well. Considering that the place was loud and full of drunk people. our waitress was able to take our orders and give attention to our table effortlessly. We were able to order, eat and pay without any issues.  Please open a Tilted Kilt in San Jose :)"}
{"text":"I understand the comparisons to Hooters--cute gals serving up cold suds and wings to a mostly male crowd--but the Kilt has a much more sophisticated menu and incomparable draft beer list.   Some of the Downtown girls are a little green--this location just opened July 5--but I'm guessing that All-Star Week provided a nice trial by fire. They'll thrive during the Diamondbacks' pennant chase and upcoming Suns game. Close proximity to the stadiums with excellent second-level CityScape views. Nice patio too once the summer heat breaks.  The only entree I've ever eaten is Chicken Tender Wrap. It's excellent. The Nachos are decent and enough to feed 6. Wouldn't recommend the Barbecue Chicken Quesadilla.    The Tilted Kilt has good food, not great, but really it's the atmosphere you're coming for."}
{"text":"For a few games of pool and a few pints you really can't beat this place. The staff are always 100% friendly and the Shepherds Pie if pretty good too."}
{"text":"Typical gastro pub food, not that great, but not bad either.  Let's face it, people do not come here for a five star meal.  The waitresses are lovely, flirty, and fun.  The beer is good, and it is in a good location.  Plenty of large screen television to watch your favorite sports, and gernally a good place to hang out."}
{"text":"Normal Tilted Kilt environment.   The gals were friendly and very pretty.  Food was good, tables and restaurant were clean.  Good place for lunch...lots of Tv's with good clear picture.  A lot of choices of draft beer."}
{"text":"Went there for the Guinness  beer, also had the nacho with beef appetizer. My son and i had a good time in a friendly and clean environment."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations are too high for Vegas but this place was just sub-par.  I got a Corona and ordered the chicken tenders mixed with their tilted sauce.  It honestly tasted like buffalo sauce.  I was not given any utensils or napkins even though it was obvious I would need some.  Last but not least, when I was paying, they dropped my card on the floor and the server didn't even realize it.  Had to ask the barback who then asked the server and she mumbled to him that it was on the ground...didn't even come over to apologize or anything.  Overall, service was pretty terrible.  The food was average.  The atmosphere was okay, given I was there to watch the Warriors game and they have a lot of TV's.  I've definitely experienced better sports bars in my life. I would not come back."}
{"text":"Bad customer service and so was the food. Our waitress kept disappearing whenever we needed something. The garlic bread wasn't even garlic-y. The calamari had burnt pieces in the basket and some of the calamari was soggy. I didn't like the classic mule it tasted watered down or they didn't put the ginger beer so I sent it back. She \"forgot\" to take it off our bill. We waited again for her to pick up the check so we could point it out to her. We had to walk up to the front desk to ask for the manager to fix the problem. The manager never showed up. Our waitress finally noticed all of our group standing up getting ready to leave and then rushed to get the manager to fix the problem so we could pay. We paid and got the f*ck out of there. THE END."}
{"text":"Absolute horrible service, I would never go there again. Sat for 15 minutes after being seated by a very crabby hostess. No waitress ever showed up to even take our drink order. There were 4 waitresses standing at the end of the bar looking very confused about what they should be doing. Needs new management if you ask me!!"}
{"text":"A friend wanted to go here for dinner. Was skeptical about it. Pleasantly surprised. Food was good. Servers were all very nice and good at getting orders in and out quick."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with a couple of friends/colleagues and while it was a Monday night, it was 6pm and there was a total of about 5 people in the place. None the less we ordered some beer and some food and attempted to enjoy ourselves. The construction up stairs, which was a powerful jackhammer, made the experience a little annoying but no fault to the Kilt. The bartender was preoccupied with anything other than us, which was fine...but I mean..whatever. The food was mediocre, I guess what you would expect. I had a veggie burger, another had the deep fried monte-cristo*, that was a bad choice, and the other had some sort of adult meal like chicken potatoes and a vegetable... anyways a few more beers and we bounced!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review specifically because we go here often as it is our local haunt and accept that the food is just okay to pretty good and the service ranges between adequate and poor because we have a large group of friends who frequent the place too. We had decided to go to Boston Pizza but because of an email my bf received regarding a free dessert that looked delicious in the photo decided to go here....anyway we ordered the dessert to go after we had finished our lunch and drinks (we asked for salted caramel - nothing with nuts because of allergies) and when we got home and opened the container the cookie was macadamia and white chocolate and it was RAW!!!! RAW!!! It was not just the fact that it had nuts (which my bf is allergic to) it's also that it was uncooked, a double whammy of hazardousness!   This place has always been average but since new owners took over recently it has gone from bad to worse! Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"humm where should i start?? I'd like to classify this restaurant as a new version of hooters! All the waitress were in short kilts and bras with  tied up dress shirts. lets just say we could see everything!! I had a feeling this would be the case from what i saw on the website but decided to go anyways.. i went there last Saturday night and it was packed (which i thought was a good sign) our waitress was friendly but not very quick on picking up on clues.. we decided to order the appetizer pub pretzels and both my friend and i though it was absolutely delicious with the Guinness cheese sauce to dip. i then ordered and enjoyed the BBQ Bacon Burger.. it was massive and a mouth watering goodness.. my friend ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger and she said it was tasty as well. she also ordered a side of gravy which didn't come with the meal!! when we were about half way through our meal our waitress came by to see how we were doing.. when my friend said she didn't get her gravy but not to worry about it, the waitress said \"it should have come, i'll go get it\" again my friend said \"it's ok\" and she responded by saying \"well i already rang it in and charged you so i'm going to get it\" I really didn't see the point of it since my friend was already half done her meal. When we finished it seemed to take a really long time for the waitress to come back and give us the bill. I even made a bathroom trip and still nothing. All in all great food, lots of space, and great atmopher but i think they just need a little more staff."}
{"text":"Meh. Not bad, but definitely not great.  I can't really say it's a wannabe Hooters - but they are definitely looking to attract a certain crowd, that's why they are located a short walk from the arena and stadium.  We went in on a Saturday afternoon before a game, expecting a crowd. There wasn't really anyone there - we had 1 beer and left. We had already eaten, so we didn't even look at the menu.  The beer selection is good, but not great. They could definitely improve there.  We sat at the bar and although she wasn't rude, the bartender definitely wasn't friendly either. Turns out it was just about the end of her shift and she must've just been ready to go. The guy who replaced her was much nicer, but we were just ready to go at that point.  It costs us almost $18 for 1 cider and 1 beer - which is pretty high, in my opinion. But I guess expected, based on the location. I'm not a big fan of this chain to begin with, and this location certainly did nothing to change my mind.  My suggestion is to avoid it and find a better local spot."}
{"text":"Atmosphere promises alot. Food was abysmal, my hamburger was raw inside and cold. Waitresses were attractive and scantily dressed but our waitress was too busy kissing her boyfriend who was seated and was unable to provide even  so-so service."}
{"text":"So I was on a bit of a side trip this past weekend and stopped in here with some friends from the area.  We were going to a sporting event in the area and decided to grab a bite before going into the game.  Not sure if the experience was just due to there being a sporting event around the corner or if this place is just this bad every day.  So lets start it off at the door.  Walked up to the hostess stand where three ladies in the bars outfit of short plaid skirts, white dress shirts open to show cleavage, and knee socks were standing around chatting it up about someones boy toy.  Took me a few minutes to get their attention.  I was then informed it was a wait for a table and handed a paging device to let me know when the table was ready.  Nothing else, no how many in the group, no suggestion to grab a drink at the bar, nothing.    OK.. so this is off to a bad start.  So the folks I am with and I decide to ignore the ladies at the hostess stand like they did to us and wandered over to the bar for a round of drinks.  This round was by far the best part of our visit to this establishment.  The bartender was a nice guy got us exactly what we ordered very quickly and even engaged us in some small talk for a bit as he delivered our round.  He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.  Wish I could remember his name to give him proper credit.  He is the only reason this visit did not end up with one star.  While we were standing there with the pager puck we could see three tables big enough for our group left uncleared for at least 15 minutes.   So after about a half hour the little pager puck starts blinking and we head back to the hostess stand.  Come to find out for our group of four the ladies put down a group of two.  Glad our whole group walked up there or we would have been squeezed into a postage stamp table.  First table the gentleman (I am guessing manager of some level) took us too was inside and the din was about deafening.  We asked for a table outside that we had seen that were left uncleared.  The gentleman seating us said he would check on those.  We followed him outside as he caught someones arm and had them clear and wipe off a table for us.  Our server showed up a few minutes after the manager/seater left and took our drink order and a appetizer order.  About ten minutes later she showed back up with half of the drink order and a promise to be right back with the rest of them.  Only bringing some things and broken promises are going to be common occurrences for the evening, but you will gather that in a few more lines.  So without the rest of the drink order and not the alcoholic ones those came out the first time, she came back to take our food order.  After she finished that we had to practically grab her arm to ask about the rest of the drinks to which she replied she would be right back with them.  Well 10 minutes later we flagged down a different waitress to get the rest of our drink order.  When the Appetizer came out it was good, we had the Irish nachos or whatever they were called.  Very good I thought, nice sized portion for our group.  Might be a bit much for a party of two.  No mention of the half of the drink order that we had to ask someone else for.  Not even an offer for refills, had to ask for those.  Refills came out about 15 minutes later with a promise that our dinner order was soon to be up.   Well 20 minutes after that we flagged down the Manager/seater gentleman as he was walking nearby and asked for refills and an update on when our dinner order was going to be out.  Should have kept an exact clock running on all of these visits as I am sure it was another 10 minutes at least before our waitress came by with one of the three refills requested, the alcoholic one of course and a promise that our dinner order was next up.  Fast forward another 15 minutes to a different waitress bringing out our food order and not the two other refills that we had asked for from the manager a half hour ago or so.  That waitress brought the lemonades right away and was apologetic.    Dinner was good.  Should have been after waiting the better part of an hour and a half to get it.  No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.   Overall, I don't think I will be back to this location.  Might try a different one and on a night that there isn't anything else going on to see if this type of service is the norm or just because of the events downtown.  In short ... Yelper Beware ... this is not a place to go if you have anything planned afterward unless you give yourself a few hours."}
{"text":"The people who say the food is bad, obviously never really tried it.   The people who complain about the price of beer, it is average for the city.  The people who complain about the skantly clad beautiful young waitresses and bartenders, get over yourselves you stuck up prudes.  Went here for beers before the Pirate game and had a blast.  Both the server and manager were top notch.  I have eaten here before and have always really enjoyed the food.  Keep in mind it is bar food and not $100 a plate fine French cousine."}
{"text":"The girls: 5 stars - me gusta The food: 3 stars - very normal The price: 3 stars -  I guess it's the vegas price The location: 4 stars - very cool new spot in vegas The TVs: 5 stars - especially if you love sports  Come again? Probably not, there are way too many places to go and try in Vegas for me to go some place twice especially if the food wasn't good."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, as I live in uptown and this is a short drive. Came tonight to watch ufc with a buddy visiting from overseas. Had to track down our server 3 times to get our drinks - empty.  Also, asked for Boddington's and she said they don't carry it...20 minuted later she walks by the table with a Boddington's for another table. What the?  Oh she said she didn't know...."}
{"text":"Sports bar with a thousand TVs and girls wearing next to nothing. It's like Hooters, but a notch higher (lower?) on the clothing scale. I was surprised to see teenagers and younger being brought by with their parents. The waitstaff don't leave much to the imagination. I found it to be too obvious and rather distracting, but that's just me. The place is usually very packed, so others clearly have a different opinion.  It's a well executed concept with decent bar food, I had a \"Sloppy Jane\" which is shaved rib eye, cole slaw and Swiss cheese served with a massive pile of salty spiced fries. While it certainly qualified on the \"sloppy\" scale, I'll try something else next time. I've heard that the burgers are all very good.  Plenty of beer choices and of course a full bar of mixed drinks, the place gets very busy during major sporting events, though on this particular Saturday the college games and the NASCAR race were muted while the singer in the corner did his thing.  Lots of tables as well as interesting \"bar\" areas where you have a hightop stool but you're sort of sharing the space with the guy across from you. If you're looking for a new sports bar hangout, this is absolutely the place to try!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but food portions are light.  Put some food on that plate.  On a positive note, Dani is a great server!"}
{"text":"I am a Washington Redskins fan and they were opening early for the game. My husband found this out for me and we showed up at some ungodly hour in the morning. They were playing in London. We had a nice breakfast and lots of drinks. Been to a few of these and they are pretty much the same. You can count on good drinks and food."}
{"text":"Fun sports bar. The food portions are huge. The staff is nice. I had the pork taco's...they were very spicy which I liked."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy. Kind of a rowdy crowd. I'd consider this more than a bar than restaurant. Service was really friendly, though. Food wasn't spectacular. I was here for a gig, but I'm not sure I would have gone otherwise. I do, however, love when a venue supports local comedy."}
{"text":"Went in twice the first time with my boyfriend and his friends the waitress. Miranda sucks ass her service sucks and she has no common sense and she is fucking stupid. Second time my boyfriend and his friends went in and she had a balls to ask my boyfriend for his number!! Tonight we went and she was our waitress AGAIN! And no shit same thing happen and she even said \"ops I forgot ur Order\" to one of our friends!! Oh and when I said something about him getting charged her comment was: \"he still got it!!\"  Bitch please I have more experience in waitress than you and I can tell u something and don't forget it! If u fucked up own it and know that the customer is always right!!! That is why u got no tip from my table!!!!"}
{"text":"I dig it! The service is great and my friend Ash loves the nachos. I enjoy coming here when I'm not fighting evil."}
{"text":"Stopped in a few weeks ago to check out the successor to the Atomic 29, which was a short lived BBQ joint that formerly occupied this space.  The Tilted Kilt is a YAF (Yet Another Franchise) class establishment, that some some clever people have christened the \"Irish Hooters\".   The original location made its debut at the Rio in Las Vegas, and it has been spreading like an airborne virus across the land ever since.  What's good about the Tilted Kilt:  Lots of beer on tap, including, Four Peaks Tilted Kilt, Stone Arrogant Bastard, and Rogue Dead Guy Ale. Available in big ole \"Man Size\" 20oz imperial pints.  Stockings and plaid skirts.  Lots of flat screen TVs, and one big projector screen playing sports if that's your thing.    Stumbling distance from my fortified compound.  What not so good:  The meat-head crowd that a few of the above features attract.   YAF status.  Totally blacked out windows, a la every shitty bar in Las Vegas. Crappy tattoos.  The first night I went they had Ultimate Fighting Championship bouts playing on the numerous flat screen TV's.  A few other TVs usually feature what appears to be a \"house\" extreme sports style channel, similar to Fuel TV, but called ITV here, IIRC.    It's got all your standard bullshit bmx, surfing, base jumping, skate, white guys with shitty tatoos to zone out to.   Usually more entertaining than the main stream sports, IMO.  While the fight was taking place the Kilt was packed with a lot of East Valley muscle head D-bag bros rockin the Affliction shirts and ball caps with flat bills cocked ever so expertly to the side, moto-cross style bay-bay.  As soon as the fights ended, they mostly cleared out.   A few weeks ago when I was passing by, I did see several Mesa police cars and an ambulance in back, so this might be a good place to catch a real fight, or perhaps get your own teeth kicked in.   The waitresses were numerous, and helpful, friendly & bubbly.  The food was decent both times that I've been there, I had the pulled pork sandwich, and the buffalo wrap.  Pricing is alright, not really any smokin' deals on food or drinks was my general impression.    Outside there is a big L-shaped patio w/music and misters for you smokey treat lovers and outdoor enthusiasts.  Inside the bar, there seems to be sports blaring from all TV's earlier in the day/eve, with music later on at night.   The music wasn't half bad, last time I went."}
{"text":"The service was okay, they had a dj spinning right in the food area which was cool because he played jams, but it was also very loud and oddly placed. The server didn't really know much about the prices of drinks or the specials of the night...like we knew more about the specials because they were posted outside of the door. I just got a cheeseburger and there was nothing spectacular about it. Prices are decent though if you want a quick bite to eat before a show."}
{"text":"Oh my god, did you see how big those things are?? Like in your face huge! Get your mind out of the gutter, I'm talking about the nacho's. Yes, the amount of silcone came in a close second size-wise, but the nacho's were bloody huge. The taste was alright, but nothing to get excited over for this nacho conniseur.  Food, meh. Ambiance, meh. Cider selection, miniscule. The group I was with was great though, so I had a great evening talking with friends and playing NTN trivia.   It was pretty quiet for a Saturday night, which suits me fine really. At least we got good service. The waitress had no choice but to pay attention to us since we were her only table.  I don't know what the guys below are talking about, these chicks have great racks (I'm sure they're all putting themselves med school, right?) and slamming bodies. Besides, I challenge Brian S. to walk around slinging beers in a tiny skirt and little more than a bra and see how unforgiving the ladies are with his shape.   Good enough for a Saturday night out, but nothing special."}
{"text":"The waitress was so hot I spend half my time trying to find her on Tinder. I was so focused and determined, I didn't even realize that my food was setting in front of me. I didn't get her name, but Shawty if you reading this holla at me babe.   P.S: the food was surprisingly good, but the service could be better. Not my waitress tho she was A+."}
{"text":"It was 10:00 pm. it took forever for the food to get to us when they weren't even busy. The server was rude and the staff was inattentive. It was a bad experience altogether. That was the first and last time I will ever go there."}
{"text":"The service was so terrible I can't even believe it. A friend and I thought we would eat and get a couple drinks because why not try something down town right? No. We were greeted and taken to a table and we waited about 15 minutes with no other interaction with anyone else who worked there even though we made eye contact with about 5 people who were working. We ended up leaving without anyone bringing us water or even saying hello. Don't go here ever. These girls are ditzy and lazy."}
{"text":"Chose this place because my husband and I remembered going to a Tilted Kilt in Vegas and enjoying the food and atmosphere.  This one didn't disappoint either.  Nachos (classic) were delicious. Probably my favorite bar nachos I've had, ever. Shepherd's pie was also good. Always nice to see the waitresses and generally enjoy the great atmosphere to be had here.  Great happy hour deals at this location.    Bonus for us--Seahawks booster club meets here, so there's a couple 12 flags hanging."}
{"text":"The Tilted Kilt.  The Irish Hooters....  Please don't misunderstand....I love me some chain restaurants.  Cheesecake Factory, that's my ish.  This place...not so much.  Maybe it's the boobalicious, scantily clad waitresses that turns me off.  Or perhaps maybe it was the terribly slow service we received ($2 cans of Yuengling really take 15 minutes to deliver?!).  Or maybe it was the mediocre to tasteless food we received.  Regardless, this place just left a bad taste in my mouth.  Even after 3 beers.    I'll stick to Jerome Bettis down the street.  At least they have a massive Carrot Cake waiting for me and not massive boobies."}
{"text":"If you want to look at girls in kilts/miniskirts that look like they're still in high school prancing around it's great in addition to a large volume of TVs... food is decent prices are decent nothing much stands out at the tilted kilt"}
{"text":"So, Tilted Kilt...  I have passed by other branches of this franchise numerous times in Atlanta, and have been meaning to try it for years.  With the premise being a classier version of Hooter's, how can you go wrong?  The occasion finally comes in the form of a bachelor party, as a few of my friends from Chicago make their way to Vegas for their own version of Hangover.    We meet up at Caesar's and cross the street to the Linq, and they're impressed with the short strip of entertainment.  We wait just a bit (10 minutes or so) for a table, and get seated by one of the girls.  Positives:  Girls are really nice, from the hosts up front to our server.  There are TVs everywhere for the games, and every spot is a good spot for watching.  Food comes fast, and they are pretty good - wings, flatbreads, and garlic fries.  The have Smithwick's on tap!  Negatives:  Girls don't quite reach our expectations from physical-standpoint, and are not as social as Hooter's.  Food is only pretty good, not great.  They don't have Boddington's, or at least our server didn't know what it was so I assume they don't.    While we had light fare this evening, we did drink and it only came out to about $30 each including tips.  This indeed is couple notches above Hooter's, and to me a more enjoyable place to watch the games because of their much more diverse food and drink options.  If it wasn't so far from my house (and if it wasn't in the middle of the strip), I'd probably come here more often.  3.5 stars overall I think, but since I can't give that and I'm still on the fence about it, I'll bump it down.  Table-for-1 Factor:  Large bar, but do you really want to sit here by yourself?"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst tilted kilt I've ever been to in my life! I walk into watch the game the hostess tells me I can sit anywhere I want and someone will be right with me. After 15 minutes of waiting, my buddy finally showed up... still no waitress. After another 10 minutes he had to flag a waitress down and she said let me find who is in your section... (while she's taking care of three tables right around us). So she passes us off to some other waitress who's in the area and she comes over all smiling and happy fake attitude... I gotta tell ya, this place is so disgusting, it didn't seem like there was a girl waitress over the age of 17 there, almost makes it seem like the guy hiring them is a fucking pedophile. It just rubbed me the wrong way that's all, wasn't as enjoyable as I hoped it would be.. (watching a game with a buddy) just irritated the shit out of me. I'm sure other TK's are better than this, I'll just never return to this one."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Tilted Kilt twice. I don't plan on going back.  The girls n beer choices are great but the food is mediocre at BEST. I tried the Spinach & Artichoke Dip and it was unrecognizable. Lots of tiny ground spinach in unidentifiable sauce. No sign of artichokes and some glob of melted cheeses on top. Sent it back. The garlic fries were very mediocre as well, but at least edible. Previously I had a cheeseburger, not very well seasoned and those fries were hot.  So go for beer & boobs...but eat someplace else."}
{"text":"The slide continues. Service and food quality consistently deteriorating. I can no longer make this a regular stop,,,,,too many better options downtown now."}
{"text":"Ah the Tilted Kilt. Met a friend here Thursday evening around 530pm for a quick beer before heading out for the night. My memories of Tilted Kilt were mostly about the hot beautiful ladies serving and bartending, so I was quite shocked to see a guy bartending on this particular evening. No offense to him, he was a very good bartender and knowledgeable on beers, but I can find that at hundreds of other places in town. I wanted to see cute girls!!!!  The 3 stars is because their selection of beverages, while eclectic, is pretty routine and lacks a good Hefeweizen. I had the Joseph James local one, and it was lacking for my taste buds with a bit too much hoppiness."}
{"text":"Excellent food but it took a while to get our first orders of margaritas. However, I would recommend the grilled Thai wings and the chicken strips with garlic and Parmesan flavor. They were delicious."}
{"text":"Only 20 minutes to get a beer... When they are dead. There are more waitresses sitting at tables than working! ... I take that back they are \"working\"."}
{"text":"Never been before. We were in Phoenix for a concert across the street.  I ordered the Danny Boy's Sheppard's Pie.  Boring. One note flavor, and just covered up by boxed potatoes.  It's served with \"toasted\" bread. Mine; burnt.  I also ordered a Ceaser's salad.  Poor thing... drowned twice in dressing.  My water was good, though. And our waitress at least made eye contact with me, and not just the boys."}
{"text":"We visited the Tilted Kilt on Sunday, January 9, 2016, the day before the college football National Championship game.  Being a Clemson fan, there was a sea of orange in the restaurant, more than crimson.  We were there to meet up with friends and watched some of the NFC playoff games that were going on.  We sat at the bar during our first visit, and had some bar stools and tables set aside later in the evening.  All the beer we had was cold.  The food was okay.  I checked in on Yelp! and received a FREE order of the Irish Nachos.  They were good.  Different, but good.  Our waitresses kept the drinks coming so we were happy.  This was a GREAT location because it was just up (literally) from the area where the Fan Experience was taking place outside."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. We like coming here because it's close to where we live and the food is always good. Lots of tv's and the beer is cold. Our server/bartender (Katie) was great as usual. Thanks TK!! Can't wait for new location to open next month!"}
{"text":"Remember name that tune?   Well, I can name (describe) this bar in 2 words or less.    (The crowd goes \"Wooooooooooo\".  My opponent lets a bead of sweat run down their forehead.  They know they can't do better....)  Are you ready?    Scottish Hooters  See if this is familiar to you.  Food that is ok in general with a couple of \"specialties\" that rise a bit above the rest.  Lots of big screens on all over the place,  showing the big games that are on that night.  And for some reason guys often aren't able to finish a sentance without pausing as their eyes follow one of the waitresses walking by.    Now add to that an AMAZING amount of noise.  We were part of a large party and I couldn't hear more than 1 person from me without the other person yelling.  Then know that several times during your evening there will be jokes about what the girls, and the boys (bartenders) really are wearing under their kilts.   It appears there is quite a bit of parking, but folks getting there after 7 on a Friday night had to park at the shopping center across the street.  It gets THAT full.  My friend, after checking out \"the View\" said, \"Ok, I'd drive from Surprise for a glass of water here.\"  That really describes it from a male perspective.  No one will talk about the food when you leave. Only the kilts.  Which isn't so bad...."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Food is mediocre.  It's not inedible, but it's just frozen fries, grocery store sandwich buns, etc.  Certainly not worth the price.  Perhaps if I were an 18 year old guy, the servers would be enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped by on way to the conference center for a drink. Staff was friendly and the bar was inside on the upper level. Great selection of drinks and food. Several local beers to pick from on tap. The rating would be higher but $6 bucks before tax for a draft beer is a little on the high side. Sorry won't be back here."}
{"text":"Stopped twice to watch NFL football. Saw someone else order the nachos and they  (the nachos) looked better than the last time I had them, so I ordered. Nachos definitely better. Their salsa is probably a big hit everyplace else in the country. We, in the Southwestern United States, know salsa.  Service is hit or miss. Some servers are very friendly and anticipate needs. Others are simply functional. I guess this could be said about any restaurant.   Free Wi-Fi is still an awesome thing!"}
{"text":"Hey if you didn't know they just reopened this August with new girls and what seems to be a better kitchen staff. I see a lot of new talent and I recognize maybe one or two familiar faces. Either way a great place to watch the jays and a great place to start a friendly conversation."}
{"text":"I have been to other Tilted Kilt locations (scottsdale) in the past and been relatively satisfied with service & food.  This was my first time at this location (Saturday night to watch the World Series game).  When I walked in, the baseball game was not on any TV's & I requested it to be shown on a couple side TV's as the big screen/projector was tuned to college football.  After college games ended, the manager was nice enough to put on the audio to the MLB game and put it on more TV's after my request.  Aside from this -- my chicken tender wrap was great and the waitress seemed friendly initially.  After my first beer was gone, it took about 15 minutes before I saw the waitress again and asked for another beer.  Finished that beer and didn't see the waitress for another 20 minutes.  Needless to say I was ready to go and asked for my check.  Another 20 minutes passed before I saw the waitress again - but I saw who I presumed to be the manager and asked if I could get the check.  He alerted the waitress and she brought over the check.  I can say that I will not be back to this location again.  Poor experience."}
{"text":"If I were a dude, I may well have done 5 stars.   Once we got our scantily clad waitresses attention, she stayed on the ball and checked on us often.  I ordered the free Irish Nachos (thanks, Yelp - make sure you check in), a beer and the chicken club.  The Irish Nachos were like nachos on chips, but were fairly good and ample sized to share with my table of 5.  In fact, I think I may have eaten too many because by bite two of my sandwich, I was full.  Speaking of, yea...the sandwich was almost $10 but it came with fries and it was perfectly acceptable in my sports eatery book.  One of my favorite things about the Kilt is that the walls are literally covered with quality/large televisions.  It'd be a great place to watch a game.  It had plenty of conversation starters (Not sure why they have framed Monty Python stuff, but hey...I love MP so it's not a complaint, just strange) and the waitresses were great to watch flirting with the Marines during marine week.  I would imagine if one of those flirty waitresses were mine, maybe my service wouldn't have been good, but I seemed to be lucky enough to get one that took her job seriously.  So there you go.  I think the Kilt is an asset to downtown.  Surprise!"}
{"text":"If you go to Hooters for the hot girls...the Tilted Kilt will make you cross eyed.  Maybe I just like the tartan  but the ladies in this place are simply stunning.    And even better...they are personable.  The Kilt is on the second floor...there is an escalator on the north side that will get you up there.  It is not obvious so...look for it.   I showed up just after 3:30.  Pretty quiet in there. Not to minimize the value of the eye candy but the salmon I had for dinner far exceeded expectations.  It came on a bed of peppers and broccoli and had a nice bite to it.  I wasn't expecting it to be spicy but it had some heat.  It  was cooked to perfection, just the right level of doneness and the spice/heat made it perfect.  Without good food...the experience would have been incomplete.  This was about the best salmon I have had...anywhere. 2 Guiness beers and the salmon ran $34.  Quite affordable and again...the ladies with their kilts are surface of the sun hot."}
{"text":"We stopped into the TK in downtown Phoenix yesterday afternoon to get some food and cocktails before a concert.  The place wasn't busy by any means and we were properly greeted at the door by 4 servers who were mingling at the front desk area.  We were seated at a high-top between the from door and the bar.    A waitress came over, dropped off menus and took our drink order.  She returned with the drinks then rejoined her colleagues chatting and cell phoning at the front desk.    Drink 1 finished and no return trip to our table to refill or take our order.  Waiting...finally, I had to get up and go to the front desk to ask if we could order food.  Waitress came over and we ordered.  We waited and waited for food to arrive and finally had to get up again, go to the front desk and asked our waitress if our food was ready.  She went to the kitchen and low and behold, our food was sitting there waiting for someone to serve.  After delivering, she returned to her chat at the front desk.  To get a drink refill and our check required trips 3 & 4 to go get our waitress to give us some attention.  The food was good but I have to say that they really need to do a better job training their pretty lasses about how to serve.  Her tip reflected the lack of effort she gave."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. We sat for 20 minutes with zero acknowledgement. We finally had a waitress say hello as we were walking out the door. There were plenty of employees walking around us, but nobody even bothered to check on us. In 20 minutes we couldn't even get waters to the table. Not to mention there were literally 7 (I counted) empty tables in our direct vicinity. It's the worst service in the country, not just the city. I am in the industry and have ran several concepts in a managerial role, this takes the cake as the worst I've ever seen"}
{"text":"decent food with decent prices. been here a few times and the waitresses are pretty attentative and friendly. service is awesome and makes up for any faults."}
{"text":"A \"restaurant\" (not a nightclub) charging $20 for entry during Super Bowl weekend...and no, that $20 wasn't going toward the price of your meal or drinks. They expected us to pay them just for the pleasure of entering and then pay AGAIN to eat.  Businesses who do this have the worst kind of ethics and I'll never patronize again just based on priciple."}
{"text":"Second time here.... The food was awesome!! I had the Chicago sandwich.... my friends also loved the food. But make sure you don't have Heather as a server ... very very poor service, and rude."}
{"text":"Impressed with the appetizers and overall service from the managers. I would def come here again if in ssauga"}
{"text":"This place is kinda like a cross between Hooters and The Library, only with better food.  The servers are 9 times out of 10 very attractive, friendly, and attentive, plus only wearing little short skirts and skimpy tops.  Plenty of beer choices, and lots of options for food that are quite good.  I'm a big nacho fan, and these do not disappoint.  Their buffalo chicken wrap is a solid choice as well.  This place gets pretty crowded at lunch times and can get packed after work as well.  They have plenty of big screen TVs for watching the game, and a very large covered  patio area as well.  Aside from the servers, this place is pretty much a sausage fest (just full of dudes), so if you are looking for a place that has girls there too, you might steer clear of here."}
{"text":"It's a chain, it's a little overpriced and the food is mediocre. I went here after going to an event downtown. This location was insanely busy, but they did manage to get out the food quickly. Props to the kitchen on this.  Overall - Speed A- (considering) Food portion - C (Downtown? go to Seamus, or Turf, or Rose& Crown / In the East Valley? Fibber Magee's/Rula Bula/Robbie Fox's) Authenticity - D (It's supposed to be an Irish pub yeah?)  I realize it's a chain, so I probably shouldn't be so harsh in the first place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, but understandable that they have a game day menu. Service was ok, but nothing to write home about. Food was average. Need to try this place not on a game day"}
{"text":"This is a great place to visit if you are looking for a sports bar.  They have a huge projection TV as well as many other TVs around the whole restaurant.  It is a great atmosphere for those people who want to watch the \"big game.\"  I would say the food is mediocre and nothing to rave about.  The garlic fries are good but make me feel very unhealthy after eating them.  This is supposed to be similar to Hooters with the waitresses wearing revealing clothing and kilts.  They also have very odd humor in their menu that maybe a Californian would not understand.  Also the music selection is really odd for a sports bar.  Pros:  Great sports bar Cons:  Mediocre food and odd music"}
{"text":"Fried pickles!!! I ate a whole basket to myself! We went for some Monday night football and the manager was extremely nice."}
{"text":"this place was ok and was your typical sports bar, nothing special. we checked in through yelp and got a free Irish nacho voucher which was awesome! the chips they use are so delicious. they taste like freshly made potato chips. the inferno burger was not spicy at all and the name was totally deceiving and inaccurate. the boneless wings were good but the chicken pieces were kinda dinky and the hottest sauce was not very hot but the flavor was more flavorful than the ordinary buffalo got sauce. the service was good, nothing to complain about there. overall it was just ok."}
{"text":"Much needed review update.  I gave it a solid 4 stars my first visit... Unfortunately my last visit was rather disappointing.  It was a Saturday night, so I expected the place to be busy, but the parking lot was rather \"ghost-towny\"  That should have been my first warning shot across the bow.  My second warning was the $5 cover they charged at the door for the UFC fight which we were obviously not there to watch.  After a group pow-wow, we decided we were already here and paid the cover.  The fight coverage was already more than halfway over.  When we were escorted to our table, there was an abundance of empty tables, but some good size groups.  Our waitress was nice.... I ended up just have a Guinness or four to help curb my disappointment.  Some of my group ordered food - after making some choices, the waitress said the oven was broken so they had to pick some other apps - but really the apps they went with needed an oven to make so we were left scratching out heads...  The highlight of the night was when one group (celebrating a birthday) decided to give us the leftover birthday cake to take home."}
{"text":"Went here with a group from work.  That's the only reason I would come here.  The theme of the restaurant is of no interest to me.  And apparently the theme is the only thing they have going for them because the food was average at best.  The menu is standard pub fare with added Irish names but no real Irish spin with flavors.  I ordered the Irish French Dip.  What a disappointment.  It was a few slices of beef with melted cheese on a large bun...so basically all bread and plastic container of jus was only 1/2 full so I ran out halfway through my bread.  It also came with about 10 fries.  Wow.  There must have been a potato shortage or something.    A coworker had the fish and onion rings and said that the fish tasted like something right out of a Gorton's box.    So it's obvious people don't come here for the food...."}
{"text":"I've been here before and never had a problem but my trip today will be the last time due to the awful experience. An of age friend of mine was questioned multiple times about his ID and the manager was still called over to double check even after he provided multiple forms of identification. Came to watch the Packers game and they switched the channel half way through. The waitress misquoted us a price and I was charged over what I was told. This one time was enough to keep me from returning. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"What??  I can't believe the reviews I am reading??  The \"Titted\", I mean Tilted Kilt, isn't living up to everyone's high expectations?   A \"Scottish\" pub, in downtown CLE, with pretty servers in kilts, should be a smash hit!  NOT!  As a female, Scot, and lover of food, I am offended on many different levels.  Not because of the scantly clad women, that's their choice.  But by the awful \"Fridays meets Hooters\" menu.  And in such a prime location!   By throwing the word \"Scottish\" in front of a salad, some Steak-um sandwich, and sloppy joes??    It's theme-restaurant at it's very worst!    And unfortunately for CLE, out-of-towners, coming for the casino, will have there first look at what they think we consider good eats.    Total Rubbish!!"}
{"text":"Checking into Yelp got us a free appetizer . Dave is loving it. They have their own calendar of the kilt girls"}
{"text":"Nothing special to this place. It is like all the other chain restaurants. Will give them credit though, for it was a game day and they were pretty good with service and making sure we got what ordered in a timely fashion.  The beer selection was amazing with close to 50 beers on tap, so they have a flavor for all different styles so you should not go away thirsty.  If you enjoy this atmosphere they do a decent job and the prices were not too bad."}
{"text":"came here for food and drinks before a concert across the street which was a bad idea from the thought of this being an idea, which I should have known was terrible. came to this location with a group on a very busy Sunday evening. suffice to say that this place is gimmicked with its name, all of the ladies are wearing kilts/school girl attire and to me it does nothing, but to some of the people attending this pub, they think its the greatest thing since sliced bread. I can tell you without any shred of misinformation, only half of this group got food, but everyone got drinks. I was one of the ones that didn't get food, not for not wanting food, I was starving upon arrival, and I was even more famished on leaving. the service here is terrible, I mean really? i didn't get any food, the menu options looked great. the seating area is packed extremely tight, to the point where everyone is bumping into each other.  I feel bad for the staff and all of the harassment that they go through that I witnessed via other patrons.  transit options are not very good/easy( i walked from union station) and parking is a bunch of underground parking lots.   this place should be shut down in my brutally honest opinion for all of the above reasons."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Liked the decor and the uniforms. Drink specials were decent and our waitress was nice and attentive. Overall, had a good time there and I would go back."}
{"text":"To Hell with Hooters and Half Moon! They ain't got sh*t on the Kilt.  Whoops the Ni99a came out for a min.  Get back in there, they're not ready. lol The Kilt has decent plasmas, and lots of room (except for UFC matches, so crowded no one else was admited).   I love the 3 dollar jack and cokes (24/7 - 365), and the hot wings here are to fall back in your chair and die for. Not to mention the Tempe location has some very attractive eye candy for me and my entourage.   Ask me about a good sports bar for UFC and this is it."}
{"text":"I used to come here to play poker. It's a chain in the same spirit as Hooters or The Library in that they feature scantily clad young girls serving alcoholic beverages and a variety of fried foods while multiple televisions pointed at every angle display whatever sporting events that happen to be happening at the time.   Tilted Kilt is a little more like the LIbrary in terms of the outfits the girls wear... similar to a stripper's version of a Catholic School Girl. I've always found the Hooters thing to be quite unappealing. If you come to Tilted Kilt for the buxom girls, you'll be both relieved to know that they are typically of the attractive ilk and disappointed to discover that they will never take their tops off for you - no matter what you tip them (just a guess, I've never tested this theory). It's hardly worth an ogle... maybe a glance from your periphery.  So what's left is the food and the drink. Happily, the food is pretty decent - though it's odd. They have salads topped with sandwich innards and sandwiches filled with salads. I can't say it's health food, but it's tasty enough. I mean, who puts a philly cheese steak on top of a salad? I guess Tilted Kilt does. And it's not bad. Some of it is a bit flavorless, but add a bit of salt and it's fine. And some of it is downright great for that type of food. One of the better salad wraps I've had.   This is definitely a man's hangout. I wouldn't suggest bringing a date here unless she also likes boobs busting out of tiny tops with bras showing, greasy fried meatatarian cuisine, and your attention drawn away from her lovely eyes towards whatever motocross, boxing or basketball event (in other words: beer commercials) happens to be on.  The atmosphere is fairly generic, but comfortable. The drinks are stiff enough. And the prices aren't ridiculous. It's like any number of places - Red Robin, TGIFridays, etc... except for the boobs.   This place is between a 3 and a 4 for me, but since I can't say I'm a \"fan\" I'll have to leave it at 3. It's nice enough though and I wouldn't turn down an invite to go here... it just wouldn't be a place I'd pick."}
{"text":"Ate here before seeing TSO at the arena...  Wasn't a huge fan of the employees uniforms, definitely not a family friendly atmosphere. But we had a great bartender Chrissy, the beer cheese for the pub pretzels was amazing and the margarita pizza was also very good!  If in the area again I would go back!"}
{"text":"Everything you would expect, and the same as all other tilted kilts around the country. Average bar food, decent service, but LOTS of tvs. Worth going to if you want to watch sports and get some food, and take a break from the losing tables and slots."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  First and last time at a Tilted Kilt.   Food was ok... nothing spectacular and not a good value.   With all the great choices in Scottsdale I recommend choose somewhere else.   Fries are average at best and small quantity.  Wings are good but nothing out of the normal.    Fish and chips were good but again not worth what' you'll pay.  Atmosphere was dead.... Girls had no personality and didn't even smile.  Twin peaks is just down the road and after our visit we learned that's the place to go..... must be why Tilted was empty."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is good.  Mostly men eating and drinking when we wandered in off the Linq promenade.  Waitresses are in very pert kilt and midriff baring tops.    Overall I would give this place a 4 star, but our waitress sent it over the top. Piper our waitress was amazing.  Funny, articulate, attentive. My French dip sandwich was kind of slopped onto the table, dousing the sandwich and onion rings.  When Piper stopped by and I told her, she immediately had my meal replaced.  I have been to the Tilted Kilt in San Diego as well.  It's a solid restaurant. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Terrible food and terrible service.  Greasy fish,onion rings and the fries were cold, and don't get me started on something that was ordered at our table called.  \"chicken fried chicken\"  Just yuck.   When my husband doesn't even finish 1/2 of his meal, you know it's bad.   Service was joke. It's rude for the waitress to sit at one end of the table and expect the customer to yell their order across the table.   Trust me, I get the appeal, but at least back it up with edible food.  There are way too many other options are out there on North Shore.  Don't waste your money, I know we won't."}
{"text":"Well when you travel all the time, sitting next to strangers isn't always a way to relax. So table for 1 please, \"would you like to sit at the crowded bar?\" Not if you have a table, I'd prefer.....\"nope, no table. \"  Odd that I'm much taller and older then little miss hostess, I see numerous empty tables.  Great thing about Vegas, go across the way and spend your money at Virgil's BBQ!!  Much better food, too bad that the hostess Kilt blocked a sale during playoff hockey season, and maybe for the rest of my week. Surprisingly my food came before I was even done writing this review!!  Bye bye Tilted Kilt Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast here was not worth it. I mean it was cheap! but still not worth the cheap prices! the menu is very limited. The server was cute and everything but she wasn't very aware of what could or could not be done (for instance I asked for onions in my potatoes and she had to check to see if I could do that lol) the food came out lukewarm at best and it was just nothing to go crazy over."}
{"text":"Okay, like most of the reviews here mine will be similar.   The food is okay, The beer is very good, the waitresses are great to fantasize over.  Other then that I would not go here, especially with a family. They have wireless but it is worthless."}
{"text":"We came around Happy Hour and it wasn't very busy. We ordered a few beers from their beer list which they didn't have. Finally when we get our drinks mine is wrong along with my friends. I decide to drink it anyway and when I get to the bottom of my draft I see all this shmootz in the bottom. Gross. John Taffer would have shut it the F down. Won't go back."}
{"text":"If you like girls all slutted up in \"kilts\" and tied up white shirts (really just redefined school girl outfits) then you will love this place.  An Insider's Tip: Sit at a high top and the girls boobs will be perfectly placed so you don't have to look like you're staring.  There doesn't seem to be anything particularly great about this place, but I just love people watching here.  Overall a pretty good place to hang out, it's loud, but not too loud that you can't have normal bar conversation."}
{"text":"Oh là là la catastrophe !! Je n'ai jamais mangé un hamburger aussi mauvais de ma vie... accompagné d'un coleslaw immangeable... Ce pub semblait sympa, pas mal d'ambiance. Sans doute idéal pour boire un verre et regarder un match sur les écrans géants, mais svp, ne venez pas y dîner !!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday two weeks ago and left my credit card by accident. Called Thursday and was headed out of town so I asked if the manager would hold it until Monday. He said he would and that was fine.  I work in Queen Creek and drove the 40 miles into downtown Phoenix after work on Monday and skipped a meeting for my own child. I got there, and Robin the GM told me Danny, her assistant manager, had taken the cards to Chase Bank Friday morning to shred them all, including mine. I was MAD.  I spent gas money to get there and Danny assured me he'd hold it for me. I had to cancel all of my online transactions, too.  Robin the GM said it was Danny's fault, asked for my cell # and promised he'd call to fix it. It is TWO WEEKS LATER now and no call... ever. I am not happy. A comped meal to make up for gas money would've been nice, atleast.  Had Robin the GM known that I have the ear of the people who run Phoenix Comicon that brings over 6,000 customers into the area, perhaps Danny would've called me back. They now have the chance to lose a lot more business. People need to be fair to each other. It was my fault I forgot the card but they promised to keep it til Monday and then later promised to fix it - they did neither."}
{"text":"We went on a Monday afternoon during lunch and Everything is GREAT. Get the fish tacos or anything pulled pork related. The fish tacos have a kick to them, so make sure you're ready. Nachos are fantastic, and our waitress was super nice and personable. We got the mac and cheese to go, amazingly creamy!! You'll be pleased you went."}
{"text":"Went there last night. We were greeted nicely. Everything was going fine till it was time for paying the bill. The bartenderess xxx told us that their card terminal is not working so she can only take cash. It was hard to believe that there was only one terminal but we paid cash. The bill was 150 and we paid her 200, and she assumed that the 50 was tip. She wasn't bringing the change back until we asked for it. A few minutes later we saw the card terminal being used by another waitress at tables behind us. So that meant the bartenderess was looking to make some cash tip from us and there was nothing wrong with the terminals."}
{"text":"Danielle was awesome! I came in and sat at the bar and I was created by the bartender Danielle and she got my drink order in and came to me before I could blink! She was very friendly and personable. Even the Taylor the bar back was very friendly and kept my drinks coming with out asking. The food was amazing. I tried the buffalo Mac and Cheese and it was to die for. I would highly recommend anyone to come here and see Danielle or Taylor!"}
{"text":"This place has gross food and poor service. We ordered their meatballs and sausage appetizer and a beer. The beer was good, it was a regular coors light, classy I know. There were little bones in the meatballs and the sausage tasted plastic-like. The waitress forgot appetizer plates and had attitude. One thing I did like was the view from the upper level but that is about it. Come here for drinks but that is about it."}
{"text":"Great Irish dip sanswich! And the service was pretty good! Although my friend was comped his coke and I wasn't. Maybe the waitress like him more...still a good experience!"}
{"text":"So I got a chance and had a moment to relax at Tilted Kilt. Just going to get straight to the point.  What I ordered: Purple Haze Irish Nachos (thanks Yelp) Boneless Wings (hot of course)  My drink was super delicious! The Irish Nachos were pretty yummy...using potato chips is a nice little change up from the tortilla chips.  My boneless wings were good...a little on the not quite warm--cold side but whatever (always afraid to send food back).  My server/bartender Shane has a good vibe and was nice (didn't seem forced). There was a good amount of people there, I think a baseball game was the event. Overall, it was okay, didn't quite wow me with the food...but I would definitely go back for drinks lol."}
{"text":"Restaurant sucks. If you're not a dude you get ignored. Our table had to ask for everything even napkins! We spent ten to fifteen minutes trying to flag down one of the girls for a glass of water. They all tend to just sit around socializing with the tables of men."}
{"text":"There are truly only 3 reasons why one goes to \"The Kilt\". Eye candy, beer selection, and TV's. My brother and I showed up for the late happy hour to watch an NBA playoff game. The hostess had no clue which TV to sit us by, nor did she seem engaged at all in providing any sort of customer service. We finally just chose a table ourselves and asked her to change a channel. This was on a Thursday night, so it was not the busiest of nights. A tall waitress with glasses walked by us about 6 times and said nothing. She looked bored and tired and she must have yawned at least 4 times that I saw. The very pretty manager also walked by us a couple of times and said our server would be right with us. Finally a server came to us after we had been sitting for about 10 minutes, but she wasn't even our actual server. She did take our order, but told us that Janelle would be our official waitress. Janelle was as awesome as she could be and we really appreciated her at least trying to let us have an enjoyable experience, but too little too late. That was truly the only bright spot of the night. We will likely never be back to this establishment. TV's were fine, beer selection was fine, eye candy was pretty lacking and the poor attitude did not help."}
