{"text":"Hi. I just want to know where and how to contact to have food inspection in a Chinese restaurant.  Last weekend, my boyfriend and I went to the Elegantview Chinese Restaurant (southeast corner of McNicoll and Victoria Park) for breakfast dim-sum.  We went into the restaurant as we saw many people were eating there. While I was ordering food, my boyfriend poured the tea for me from the pot.  I saw a dead roach inside the cup while I was about to drink it.  I showed it to the floor manager.  She just said sorry and changed the pot and cups.  I asked a few things (salt, pepper and hot sauce) from the waitresses and found out that most of them don't understand English and brought back the wrong items.  While we were eating we saw another roach in congee soup.  I couldn't able to continue and showed it to the same manager.  She just said sorry again and took the card that they wrote for order.  I didn't want to stay longer that we paid the bill and left.  On the way home when I calculated and found out that the bill was overcharged.  I think the services charges are added on top of the taxes.    Roaches are scary for me because I saw in the article that \"they are unsightly, but mainly because they are known carriers of numerous dangerous, disease causing microorganisms that can be transmitted to your food, the food contact surfaces etc. potentially causing a serious food poisoning. They also contaminate the food with their hair, fecal droppings, urine, saliva, body parts and general filthy.\""}

{"text":"Came here last night for my brother's birthday dinner.  It definitely doesn't look like much on the outside and looks a little bit rundown on the inside, but you can still tell it's a nice restaurant.  They have this gigantoid stuffed bear sitting inside the entrance to the restaurant.  I'm not sure what that's all about.  We had reservations for 12 people at 6pm on a Tuesday night and got a table in the back on the raised platform area.  Everyone there was EXTREMELY attentive.  They kept coming back to check if everything was okay.  We had ordered food in advance - and boy, was there a lot of food.  I think there were about 12 courses.  The servers served everyone every dish, which got to be too much for me to eat because they wanted every course to be finished before they brought out the next one.  We finally had to tell them we'd serve ourselves.  The food was really good and the service was excellent.  I think it was really expensive though - about CD$700, I'd say.    The bathrooms were definitely not very impressive though.  It'd be a really good restaurant if they fancied it up a little bit.  I'd definitely go back for the food.  Although the dinner lasted four hours.  That was about three hours too long for me."}
