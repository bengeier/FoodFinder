{"text":"I LOVE Pancheros because it is the only fast food Mexican restaurant that makes tortillas fresh. This means that they are hot and also they don't tear like the dry ones do at other restaurants.  

The carnitas burrito is amazing, as is the quesadilla because it showcases the delicious aforementioned tortilla.  Also, the chips and queso are great!"}
{"text":"Blandest, worst \"Mexican\" food ever.  I'm from California.  We know good Mexican food.  I went to Panchero's and ordered a burrito that was half carnitas and half grilled veggies. I was hungry so I ate the whole thing.  I tasted one bite of grilled green pepper once, but otherwise, I would say there was NO salt, oregano, garlic, onions, black pepper, chile, or flavor of any kind.  It boggles my mind that you can mix sour cream, supposedly \"hot\" sauce (I told them, \"Use the hottest sauce.  Kill me\"), meat, grilled veggies, pinto beans and rice together and create no flavor whatsoever.  Now the rice.... Plain boiled Uncle Ben's converted rice.  Yeah.  It was half of the ingredients.  They didn't even salt it.  It was not Spanish rice, no tomatoes, no spice, not saut√©ed, again, nothing.  There was a \"fuego\" sauce on the table.  I covered my burrito in it.  It was as hot as ketchup.  This place could not get hot if it burned down. When I finished eating my mouth tasted like water, no flavor, nothing.  So what if this place makes their own tortillas.  They suck."}
{"text":"Used to go here all the time (probably once a week), as they were pretty consistent (but expensive...)

They closed very abruptly, I'm guessing on 5/1/2011.  It was pretty weird as I literally went there one week (last week of April), things seemed normal, then showed up the next and the place was totally cleared out: all the furniture, signage, etc was gone and the door was locked.  Usually places will indicate when they're closing....

There are a few other locations around town, but kinda doubt I'll go there.  They were roughly equivalent to Chipotle and Qdoba.  Only reason I really went here was close proximity to my work, and the fact that I had a bad experience with crunchy rice at Chipotle recently.  Probably will just go to chipotle now..."}
