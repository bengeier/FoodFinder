{"text":"Awesome music, great food, really good coffee, very nice people. Wickliffe needed for a long time. I visit all the time and bring all my friends."}
{"text":"The food is good, the coffee is good, the atmosphere is unique, the staff is terrible.  It is a shame - I have tried it twice now to give it a chance.  A lot of money and time has gone into this coffee shop; however, the staff is slow, unprofessional, and rude.  They let you know they would much rather be at home.  I grew up in Wickliffe and I know that unless the owner improves the staff this place will not last."}
{"text":"Place looks cool, unfortunately it isn't run efficiently at all. They have these cool coffee sleeves for your name and drink order, but don't use them, and confused our order. Food took 20 minutes because they were \"backed up\", but there were only 10 patrons in the establishment, half had been served, 3 (including us) had just ordered. Food came out and sent to another table, so they had to make us another order, taking even longer. When the food finally came out it was cool to the touch."}
{"text":"drove here but its closed on saturday at noon??? no answer via phone.... out of business?"}
{"text":"So excited Wickliffe has a coffee shop in walking distance from my house!! The people at the counter were friendly and the mint tea was delish! I was really hoping for a cozy place where I could bring a book and relax with my beverage but it felt like a concert venue.   Neon lights, dark concrete floors and dim lighting. I would go back for the drinks or food but order it to go :/"}
{"text":"If the Hard Rock Cafe had a love child with Starbucks, but the child might actually have been from Bruggers Bagels... you would birth this place. The food is good, portions are right for the price, but the menu is limited. They have cold and hot drinks, smoothies, fancy flavored coffee, and tea. The decor sticks with the rock theme (i loved the use of musical instruments) but the space seems underutilized. I'll definitely come back for lunch. Kids are welcome."}
