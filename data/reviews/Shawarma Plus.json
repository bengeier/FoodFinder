{"text":"Awesome fresh spiced just right Lebanese food. The kabobs are amazing. Fluffy saffron rice. And the garlic sauce brings it all together oh and the iced tea made with rose water is truly unique and incredible!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and I'm so glad to have found this awesome place! I had a lamb gyro; which was absolutely amazing! The lamb was so tender and flavorful it about melted in my mouth. The cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes and onions were so crisp and fresh, it was perfect and hit the spot on such a hot day. I ordered the rice bowl, but the owner accommodated me and let me substitute it with the gyro wrap. The stuffed grape leaves were excellent too! Had a nice piece of baklava for desert and it too was fantastic. I've found my new place!"}
{"text":"awesome food everything was so flavorful price was not too bad considering the amount of food that youll be getting and the customer service was amazing.i will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Beef and lamb shawarma plate so good must try.
Come and try its good
Clean place too
Good service"}
{"text":"Good selection of Mediterranean/Middle eastern food. Daily specials are always fresh and delicious but have to agree with some of the reviewers that Shawarma has a unique style in this place. It's more Gyro than Shawarma. Naji is a very warm and accommodating host."}
{"text":"Naji was a very gracious host, from the moment we walked in he helped us out like we were family! We went in to try out the Mediterranean food and it was amazing, we stayed way longer than expected talking about our travels around the world and what foreign languages we knew. He was very polite as was the rest of his staff. We will definitely go back to have the amazing Gyro Wraps and Hummus, the food there is some of the best in town!"}
{"text":"not enough meat on the shawarma sandwhich, you get more meat on a roberto's burrito for half the price"}
{"text":"Had a chicken panini and man was it good. Also had some of the rosewater tea, and it was really nice. A little sweetness but it was very subtle. Very reasonable prices. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is fresh and delicious, and the people make you feel very welcome. It's refreshing to go somewhere that people take pride in their business. Having grown up where Mediterranean food is very popular I definitely appreciate quality food. I'll definitely be back again and again. Shawarma Plus is the Best in Vegas hands down."}
{"text":"A must go!! A must repeat!!! Coming back for sure!! Delicious!!!
The owner is a great man, friendly and attentive. They've got a lot of variety and homemade food. Great location and excellent room and space. Definitely a place to come again and again!"}
{"text":"Great place for great shawarma.  Food taste great the owner is friendly. Go and enjoy. Tres bonne nouriture."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing.  Fresh friendly and beautiful. The rose tea is refreshing and the pickles are all in house made."}
{"text":"Clean, nice and delicious place. You feel like you are eating homemade food. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We came here with a huge group of people (12) including kids, and had a really good, quick, healthy lunch. The service was impeccable, the food was really good, and it was priced well. We all got something different and everyone loved what they got. My fav is the Shawarma plate with chicken shawarma, comes with the meat, hummus, salad and pita and the most delicious garlic sauce. Totally coming back here!"}
{"text":"Long overdue review. ..
Place is very Family oriented with friendly owner/waiter.  I like how he interacts with the customers. Food is great as well! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food. Rem8nds me of my grandma's cooking. I suggest you try this."}
{"text":"The best stuffed cabbage rolls I've ever had, aromatic and savory. The chicken moussaka was creamy and fluffy, and the tabbouleh was perfectly tart and acidic to counterbalance the other tastes. The falafel wrap was also outstanding, and $20 bought plenty enough food for two people, plus unlimited refills of the amazing rose water iced tea, the taste of which is a perfect accompaniment to the aromatic flavors in the meal. For storefront Mediterranean food in Las Vegas, I don't think it gets better than this."}
{"text":"This place was a favorite but a recent visit changed that.
Seems they now charge extra for minimal things that should be an \"extra\". A fee for adding onions and feta on a Greek salad?! That's what makes it a Greek salad! Shouldn't have to add that to it. Seems they changed their french fries too. Eh. The old ones were better. Also I thought there was a beef or lamb shawarma in addition to the gyro in the past. Maybe I'm wrong. Last time my only choice was a chicken shawarma. Or gyro. But not a beef shawarma. 
The worst part was being charged for pita bread when I ordered hummus. She asked if I wanted to purchase the pita for the hummus. I asked \"I have to pay for that?!\" yes. I then asked well how am I supped to eat the hummus without bread?! Epic fail! Hummus should come with pita. Extra I can understand charging for. But this was ridiculous. This will be my last visit."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!   Just happened to drive this place while we were hungry and decided to give it a try, glad we did.   This place is great, we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim to try something different.  The owner helped us and had such a good amount of vegetarian friendly options.  He was so polite and it was delicious! He welcomes all of his guests with a warm smile and it's like eating at home with family!  Great place to try if you're around the area!  Food is great!"}
{"text":"Great place. Fabulous staff.  Everything is extremely fresh.  Recommend it to all my friends"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, they don't have anything on their menu that isn't wonderful!  Absolutely coming back regularly. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"i ordered some food delivery earlier today that costed me almost $30. i asked for french fries no cheese and it was delivered with cheese on it. i asked for lentils soup and i received vegetables soup and i asked for a veggie plate with some changes that i didn't get. very disappointed!"}
{"text":"The beef and lamb gyro is so delicious! If I could change one thing about it, I would ask that they add feta cheese and extra sauce. Other than that, I can't complain. Also, the service is excellent! they always have a great attitude and they even gave us free dessert one time. thanks for the amazing experience Shawarma Plus!"}
{"text":"Never going to come back to this place!!!my experience was horrible. We ordered chicken sandwich and vegetables soup. The girl on counter was nice but wasn't paying attention on our order. We went back home-she packed wrong soup and then my husband start to eat sandwich and it was completely raw pieces of chicken inside. So I took everything and came back- main manager came to talk to me. I told him that we got wrong soup and showed him raw meat-first he said it was fine and then when I said it's not-he screamed on me and his face went completely red and angry. Also he said he won't give me my money back because it was just half of the sandwich. This was completely ridiculous and I made them refund my money. He was so rude and unprofessional and never even said \"I'm Sorry!!!!!!!\" Never go there if you don't want to be poised with raw meat and then yelled at."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for an office meeting, the hummus had a wierd taste and the pita bread and chicken were old. Overall, was not good food."}
{"text":"More like \"Gyro Plus\"

I'm beginning to think I'm unlucky because, unlike most reviewers, I know what real Shawarma is, and this ain't it. Whenever I'm in a new city, I try to look for real Shawarma. Outside of CA and MI, I always fail because reviewers insist they had great Shawarma that was actually mediocre Gyro.

The similarities are that both are cooked on a vertical rotisserie, and both are typically served as wraps. Here are the key differences:

- Gyro: A Greek wrap made with processed meat (deli luncheon meat). Typical toppings are COLD tomatoes, cucumbers, Tzatziki sauce, and possibly onions. The sandwich is generally cold and shaped like a cone.
- Shawarma: A middle-eastern wrap made with actual meat (beef and/or lamb) with special seasoning, and nice blob of fat on top that melts as the meat is slow-cooked. When ordered, the Shawarma is sliced down onto the griddle where it's mixed with HOT veggies (tomatoes, onions, parsley), tahini sauce, and possibly garlic sauce. The sandwich is cylindrical and is served hot.
- Abomination: Some hybrid of the two made by taking a gyro and making a small substitution such as tahini instead of Tzatziki. It's typically cylindrical like a Shawarma.

Sadly, Gyro is more well-known than Shawarma, and much cheaper/easier to make (processed meat, cold ingredients). As a result, when a place advertises Shawarma (even in its name), it is typically serving either Gyro or Abomination. Some places start out serving both Shawarma and Gyro, but end up downgrading to Abomination to save time/money. The only places that serve real Shawarma are in communities where a lot of middle eastern or Armenian people live because they know the difference.

Yelp reviewers: I have nothing against those of you who fall for the fake Shawarma. I hope you read this and start to recognize the real thing. I'd love to be able to rely on Yelp to find real Shawarma one day."}
{"text":"Always vey nice and friendly, food is AMAZING !!  Restaurant is clean and food comes out quick !"}
{"text":"They honestly have great food,Middle Eastern myself and they make amazing food I'm far from home and do you know I would eat anything they have their"}
{"text":"The service is great! I had the shawarma plate, I enjoyed only the chicken. The salad, tahini and side greens with garlic dip is too sour and oily. My husband had the gyro combo and he too doesnt get why the taste is too sour, while the pita is a bit dry and hard i'm sorry I wish I can give it a good score but the taste of the salad and tabini is awaful that I regret spending $24 for 2 meal. i've tried paymon's, fat greek and some other medditerenian flld place but this one is one of those that I may not come back. Thank you an amazing service but the sourness of the salad is just too awful for me."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Chicken Shawarma I have ever had. If you do not try it, it's your loss and you don't know what you are missing."}
{"text":"My friend has been talking about this place for a while now and how it's the best Mediterranean food in town. I finally tried it tonight and it was definitely some of the best food I've ever had! I tried a little bit of everything and it all tasted phenomenal!! Luckily for me, this place is right near where I work and I'll now be coming regularly. 

The chicken shawarma was amazing! The gyros were delicious too! I highly recommend that you put the garlic sauce on the chicken shawarma, or pretty much everything ;)  I can't wait to go back again and try other food that they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Updated review. Our delivery driver ended up coming back and delivering our food. The food was amazing! Huge portions and fresh ingredients at such a great price. I'd order from here again but would definitely pick up my order instead."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Everything here is on point. Everything taste fresh!!! If you like zankou chicken from California, you'll love this place! The staff and owner are very friendly, I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Not good anymore...

/I deleted my other good review as it unfortunately does not hold anymore./
This place has changed and gone through new management of some sort, food quality and customer service does not meet my standards anymore. I will not elaborate on the food in this review, only the customer service to make it shorter.
I went there today, ordered my usual with a side salad. The new owner/manager served me.  
I asked for the usual \"toppings\" for my salad: cucumbers, onions, olives and feta cheese.  When he got to the olives, he said it would be $1 extra (which, btw, is not displayed anywhere). I told him it used to be free as any other items there since you make your own salad, he didn't seem to care (I thought to myself he's probably having a bad day or something) so I let it go and went on to the next one, feta cheese. He sprinkled a tiny amount (which is ridiculous for a Greek salad), so I asked for a bit more (this has NEVER been an issue before).
He then flipped out, walked to the register and tried to change the order, he said I would have to pay for a medium salad which is like $2-3 more.   I told him I didn't want a medium salad and I'm good with the small side salad. and I was ready to leave after I got my main dish. This guy got so angry, he raised his voice and started preaching about \"what am I thinking, who am I, everything is free here??\" etc..  I politely told him that I just want my salad and go and that I thought his attitude was VERY inappropriate. He just kept going and turned red, other customers were watching the whole thing (bad for business). I couldn't believe what I've just experienced - I haven't seen anything like it in a long long time. 
Needless to say, I felt offended and asked for a refund, then left.  This guy had no manners nor customer service skills.
Long story short, I will NOT go to this place again and will not recommend it to anyone anymore. There are at least a dozen other Kebab places around anyway that treat you as a person and not just $$$."}
{"text":"We took a chance stopping in here for lunch and couldn't have been more pleased. The owner was very friendly and helpful and everything we tried was delicious. We both sampled the lunch special. 

My husband tried the eggplant with cheese, chicken and rice and the hummus. I tried the stuffed cabbage rolls, chicken and rice and the stuffed grape leaves. We also split an order of falafels. I sampled the rose water iced tea that a previous reviewer was raving about, but it wasn't really to my taste. 

With all that being said, everything was scrumptious. Highlights were the chicken and rice, falafels, stuffed grape leaves and the hummus. In fact, we enjoyed the meal so much that we decided to get a to-go order of the lunch special on our way out for dinner. We will definitely be back next time we are on this side of town."}
{"text":"We always come for gyros, but tonight decided to try the gyro pizza.  It was delicious!  A must try!  The hummus is fresh and flavorful!   You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I always get the vegetarian plate.  The hummus and baba ganoush are amazing. The falafel was moist, which is rare. Most of the places I have tried it was dry and crumbling. I also am addicted to the rose water tea. We drive here all the time even though we have similar restaurants closer by the house."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch! It was very good and everything taste fresh.  My husband had the beef kabob plate and I had the chicken plate.  Both plate came with hummus and salad.  I also got a side of Tabouleh, it was so good!!!! Probably what I would come back for is chicken plate and Tabouleh! The pita bread I prefer fresh ones from the oven! I would definitely would come back and try his other food.  The owner was very friendly and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"The food here is SO delicious!!! Recommend it to anyone/anytime :-) The owner was very friendly and the restaurant has a nice and fun decor. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food ever!!!! And I've tried them all...the salad is my favorite because he uses the highest quality of oils and ingredients with antioxidants..thank you SHWARMA!!! ANOTHER HAPPY CUSTOMER"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times and both times the fries have been raw. Need to learn how to cook fries from raw or just buy frozen! Other than the fries the beef shawarma is awesome!! Next time will skip the fries and grab some tabbouleh instead. Staff is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"This place is great! This is some of the best Mediterranean food I've ever had! The service is amazing as well! Will definitely return here regularly.. The menu has a lot of good options for vegetarians too"}
{"text":"The beef/lamb is awesome on top of the Mediterranean salad which is my normal dish but today i tried the eggplant with beef and the cabbage roll, I almost ate the plate it was so good.
Possibly the best eggplant iv'e had. Great place!"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service. Lots of good options and very good portions and not prucy. Love it been there few times and planning on many more"}
{"text":"I come here a few times a month. I've tried quite a few things on the menu, the chicken, the lamb, grape leaves, the baklava.. The food is always fresh and tastes great. The service is quick and friendly. I also like the sweet rose water tea :) prices are good as well. It's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here and the food was great!  I had a wonderful fatoosh salad.and hummus with pita bread. It was fabulous.  I will be back with my husband next time.

The baklava was to die for so delicious."}
{"text":"One of our favorite bites to eat in the city! We've been a fan of Greek cuisine & everything else with it for quite some time. After trial & error with a few other places in town, this is definitely a hit. Awesome service, food, and environment. The shawarmas are amazing. Everything we've had has been great! The owner is very welcoming as well."}
{"text":"Staff was awesome.  We had some new people to Lebanese food.  They explained in detail and was very patient.  Baklava was AWESOME."}
{"text":"first time ordering here today and i'm hooked. the falafel is super super good, hummus is perfect, i loved my unsweetened rosewater tea. still have some dolmas and pita to try :] ordered online and got it within half an hour of placing the order, so extra points for speed and friendly service when it got here."}
{"text":"(Food Poising!)I stop in for lunch today like I have 3 previous times within the last 5 months and ordered the same thing Chicken Shawarma with fries. It pretty much tasted the same as before (good) but a few hours after I ate my stomach started turning and then a couple of hours later......well I lost my lunch by vomiting. As I said before all other experiences were good but I'm done I can't eat here anymore as it would bring me back to this day in time."}
{"text":"Had no plans on eating this late.. We were driving down Decatur on our way home when I saw the Shawarma Plus sign. Told my brother to make a U turn lol. We just came from a massage and my Mom had a very bad therapist and didn't even care for Mediterranean food at the time. She left the massage place stressed out. My poor Mommy, but her filet mignon beef kebab made up for it :) Naji (sp?) was awesome. He greeted us with such positive vibe. Gave us a history of how he evolved with the Filipino community.  The rest of us ordered chicken shawarma and some chicken moussaka. The Rose water Iced Tea was the highlight of my meal. Baklava was also good. We had a great experience and we will be back :)"}
{"text":"Foods great. Employees are super nice. Portions are on point. 

Love this type of food and am so happy more and more spots are showing up in town. 

Been here 3-4 times now and have enjoyed everything I've ordered. 

The rice is fabulous. It's worth the price of admission on its own. 

Just make sure to ask for extra garlic sauce. It's the best condiment available to man."}
{"text":"This food is so fresh! The lamb was very tender and season well! The hummus was fresh!"}
{"text":"This is officially the first Yelp review I have ever made. That's how much I approve this place. It is a diamond in the desert. I was craving Greek food and haven't been able to find one in Southwest Las Vegas. My fiancé and I found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out. We both ordered a Beef Gyro Combo (came with fries & fountain drink) and some baklava. Annnnnd it was all delicious! Totally satisfied my craving! On top of that the owner was so humble and nice. We are definitely coming back! I'm an official Yelper!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to try the baba ganouge and loved it.  The other items were yummy too.  The service was great.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time customers and my Gf and I will definitely be back.

Delicious wraps, awesome customer service and it shows. Owners are very personable and make you feel like a good friend.

As a local I High recommend stopping in for a kabob or any of their meals."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week.  Always fresh, always delicious!  Awesome customer service.  Also, try the Rose Water Iced Tea, I'm addicted.  I almost always eat the entrees, but I know the kabobs and the gyros are great too.

Keep up the good work, guys!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot. This is the real deal. I get the chicken kabob platter, the chicken is delicious, hummus wonderful and the garlic paste is incredible, its enough for two dinners for me! The tabouli is great too."}
{"text":"I tried the food . it was  delicious n fresh . the spices was very testy. Especially the desert . I had baklawa it was yamy. The star was very friendly. I love it .  I want to go back. N try the delicious rice n chiken shawarms"}
{"text":"Meat is flavorful, rice is rice. Hummus and Baba are delicious however, that won me over. Lebanese babaganoush will always win my heart, so thank you for the introductions. I'll be back for more shortly."}
{"text":"Chicken was extremely dry. Food was not fresh. Baklava tasted like soap and I had really bad stomach ache."}
{"text":"I search the city for affordable delicious salads and their Shawarma salad with Chicken is AMAZING!  Although I'm a huge fan of salads coming with a side of bread or croutons, this salad does not, but the flavors on the salad make up for it (and I believe you can purchase pita bread for $0.99)!  The chicken is some of the BEST chicken I've had in Vegas.  I will be back MANY MANY MANY times again!  So glad I stopped!"}
{"text":"First off, let me thank Naji for being so helpful and kind. It's very rare in this town to find someone who is equal parts of passionate about their food, friendly and over the top helpful. 

I've been to quite a few places in vegas that have similar things on their menu. That, however, is the end of the similarities. The food here is outstanding. If you are looking to get your \"zankou\" cravings satisfied (for all you so-cal folks) please believe, naji's food is of a much higher quality and the flavors are a cut above any other restaurants that share similar options. 

Get the garlic sauce. Put it on everything. Buy a gallon, and use it at home, you won't be sorry. 

Give this place a shot next time you are headed west on the 215. Even if you think you don't enjoy this type of food, you're wrong. Grab a kebab. Try the filet mignon one. You like steak don't you? No red meat? Get chicken. You are vegan?? Well, I'm sure there is something for you too. You won't be disappointed. I'm serious."}
{"text":"Good veggie bowl. Prices are high for what you get. Dont get burgers there. Burnt and patty smaller then tomato."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible! The food here tastes like back home!!!! There is no place in Vegas that tastes as good and as authentic as this!
  The service is great! We got treated like kings!  
   Everything there is fresh and homemade! The deserts are delicious! 
   The restaurant is fun and beautiful inside! 
If your in vegas do not go to any  middle eastern restaurants besides this one!"}
{"text":"How in the world did this place get 5star reviews? 
I went there based on yelp, smack in the middle of lunch hour in a busy area. The place was dead - not even one customer. Should've read it as a red flag. 
Ordered 1 chicken and 1 regular shawarma combo, 3 pieces of baklava and a slice of some apricot pie, to go. First of all i went to get some sweet tea - it was so salty!! Ok, someone made a mistake, i let the cashier know, she apologizes but i guess i will drink soda. Food was ready quickly and off i went. Oh and cashier lady told me to microwave the pie, \"it's gonna be really good\" she said. 
Got home, which is 5 min down the street.  Tried regular shawarma. It was suspiciously barely warm. I was getting ticked off at this point. My son's chicken - same, like it was bought a few hours ago and just sat in the car. And it was dry. And sooo salty!! What is up with the use of salt in this place?? Fine, we were hungry and had to go to doc appointment. I open my baklava - it is dry like a crouton, inside out! And it looked and smelled super old, like fridge smell old. Don't even ask me about apricot pie - dry as a piece of wood. I can not believe establishment can get away selling this crap as food. No microwave in the world will turn this dehydrated piece of bread into \"really good\". 
All in all I'm just an occasional yelp user but i felt i had to post this review. Don't go to this place! $22+tip later, all i have is old stale pastries and dry, salty and definitely not friesh gyro."}
{"text":"This meal was delicious and a great size for the price! I got the Falafel plate and it came with... not 1, not 2... but EIGHT falafels! It is a wonderful place to stop whether you are staying in Las Vegas or just passing through. Also the employees were very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim a while back, now I find myself here at least once a week. With good food and a very friendly owner, I'm sure to keep up with that trend."}
{"text":"Establishment is very clean, great customer service and what makes it even greater is their food. This maybe one of the best Mediterranean food we've tasted. Owner is very friendly and warm!  We will be sure to come back and bring the family"}
{"text":"This was a great experience for us. We had just finished moving and were starving. Narij was very helpful about explaining the menu and even offered me a small sample of grape leaves (try the rice ones!). I had the lamb moussaka which was a bit salty for my taste but perfect for my boyfriend so we swapped and I ate his lamb shawarma wrap. The flavors and aromas were scintillating, and I am a huge fan of the rosewater iced tea. (They have sweet and unsweetened. Both are equally good!) They also have a mini deli section that sells tsaziki, baba ghanoush, and pastries like baklava for a decent price (most items are about $3.99). 

This is a counter service place, but Najir was nice enough to bring our food to us. The decor is eclectic, but they have some classic arcade machines that made us super happy."}
{"text":"What a pleasant experience!  The customer service was phenomenal and the food was mouthwatering! Great deals and great selection. I fell in love with the rose water tea! Definitely an amazing lunch spot!!"}
{"text":"This place is really quite good!  Shawarma's there are great.  They have much thinner bread for their pitas, kind of a nice change of pace from what we usually find around here.  Falafel is also good.  This is a good place for a quick lunch stop, definitely better than any fast food you'll find."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I hadnt had a chance yet to check them out. I finally got to try them, and wow, i was so thrilled!  the place is 2xtremely clean, the staff is very friendly, and the food is very flavorful.  The chicken kabob was so tasty, and the rose water iced tea is unbelievable.  I will be going back again very soon."}
{"text":"Highly recommended if you crave Middle Eastern food. The shawarma is so tasty and the fries that comes with it soooo amazing. The muskaa is amazing as well. The staff is VERY friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Nagi was amazing, we told him we had never had Mediterranean food and he just kept piling the plate for us to try! He was so excited about sharing with us! So we sat down and started eating. I got kabobs- chicken and filet. Both so tasty and cooked to perfection. My son had chicken pizza, stuffed zucchini, stuffed cabbage, spinach and chicken and chicken and rice with a meat pie on the side! We ate it all! Every bite DELICIOUS! Thanks again Nagi"}
{"text":"A great place to eat if you like Mediterranean food. Met with naji. What a great guy was he. Definitely will come back here to eat and try other kinds of dishes"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me! Service is amazing, polite and welcoming. Not only is the food delusions, it's inviting with such a large selection!"}
{"text":"Went to this place to have a bit of Mediterranean food for my birthday. It was one of the best I've had in Las Vegas. Their hummus is legendary, actually one of the bests I've ever had. The chicken and rice was so yummy, that even though I didn't order it, my friend did and I ended up eating half of hers. And the rose water here was magnificent, even my friend who only had it for the first time a month ago could not stop chugging it down by the litter. It is the perfect place to go for a fun little lunch or dinner with friends or family. Plus they deliver!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is AWESOME! I feed my family and my clients here and have been pleased every time! The owner is a great guy as well. I try to say hi when I stop in."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great, the prices are very good and the staff is super friendly and welcoming! In particular their shish kabob plate is delish; the plate comes with 2 skewers, rice, salad, hummos and pita bread. Their baba ganoush is also one of the best I ever tasted!"}
{"text":"After only my first time eating here, I have to say how much I enjoyed it! Had shawarma rice, some kind of lasagna with beshamel sauce and delicious tender veggies inside. And I also recommend the rose tea(slightly reminded me of horchata flavor)! Very different and refreshing! The only thing was, I didn't get to try everything, yet, because I was too full!"}
{"text":"Stopped on the way back home from Las Vegas. Found this place and was craving some Mediterranean food and I was not disappointed. Ample parking in the front and was thoroughly satisfied with my chicken kabob. Would come again if I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Super fresh and great customer service! I was in Vegas for work and didn't want to go to the strip for food. This place was close to my hotel and delicious! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was better than average. We got three different wraps. The menu didn't say mine would include tomato or I would have asked for it to be left off. But after unsealing it and making a mess I was able to toss the tomato and enjoy the rest of the gyro. 

Delivery was faster than the estimate at lunch time on a Saturday. But the driver was a little short. I had the receipt in my hand and he said \"that's mine.\" I asked if I could get a receipt and he said \"no\" and walked out. I would have liked to at least make a copy of the one he had in his hand because it was a work place order and I needed to collect from each person. In their defense they aren't the first place to fail to provide a receipt because eat24 emails me a receipt. My only thing is I can't print from my personal email at work so it would be a lot more convenient if they'd just give me one."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fresh, healthy and delicious. The owner was very sweet too. Explained everything to us. Will come back again."}
{"text":"If you love and need fresh delicious food, this is the place!!! Their service is amazing too!! I wish I could give it 10 stars!!"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma is the best in town!! Great pricing, fast service and caring, attentive employees and free wi-fi.... What more could you ask for? First time at Henderson location but just as great as the Decatur location.... Will be returning again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome food. super Hospitality. Gyros here are the best, the meat is tender and not dry. The pizza is delish! If you haven't been here you must try."}
{"text":"Authentic, fresh, great tasting food... My new favorite ! High quality food and a lot to choose from..."}
{"text":"Super nice people, comfortable dining room and delicious food. You can't go wrong. Shawarma is delicious as are their fries"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Was waiting for some friends to arrive and the owner brought me a drink cup and told me to settle up once we ordered food (30 min later). Was excellent food and well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Not much of a yelper usually (foodie though)
Coming from middle eastern descent I know what good m/e food should be. Owner was on the phone and taking our order as we walked in.. Food looked good, we were hungry and excited to try this place.
There was a chicken shawarma pizza that my friend asked about - the owner stated that this just got featured today and it's been flying off the shelf, I got a chicken shawarma wrap and my friend and I were going to share. The pizza was clearly not old and must have been sitting out for hours... It wasn't even served warm, I had to ask the kitchen to reheat it. 
The wrap was mediocre at vest... What really bugged me was when I asked for lemon wedges for my iced tea, which the owner told me I can't do because it's rose water tea.. Too bad I asked for Lemon wedges., Instead he gave me a  plastic packet of concentrate lemon juice. This place was a joke!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean food I have had.  Everything is so full of flavor.  Incredibly friendly staff and owner.  I will definitely be going back time and time again."}
{"text":"Their combo options are awful, and the soup tasted like a wet sock. Never again."}
{"text":"The place was small, but the most important was the food. It is so delicious food. I tried many dishes, and I like grape leaves it is first time I like it in America. Also, the tabulah, eggplant, and hummus. They're all so delicious."}
{"text":"Found this Mediterranean place on yelp since its close to my house, have tried it several times but I finally decided to have eggplant dish , not everyone knows how to make. They do! It was good or better than other similar dishes. Overall I enjoy this place my only knock on this place is that my favorite dish the Gyros are way too small . I will continue to go for the yummy homemade Mediterranean dishes."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Price is fair. No eye candy but can't win them all. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great sweet great food and great service very friendly.  Child friendly and games for children."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! !! I love it, and not to mention the owner and his staff is amazing"}
{"text":"I am an Arab and I know what is the Real Arabic food is and this restaurant is defiantly is one of the best in Vegas if it is not the best. The carting option is very good and cheep. The shawerma is very authentic. Also, the owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"We drive in from Los Angeles every two weeks and our 1st stop is Shawarma. The food is incredible but the service is even better. There is no better in Vegas for the reasonable prices. We usually have whatever they suggest as they always have new and fresh offerings. Our staples that we buy and take home are the babaganous, hummas, & garlic sauce. 

Just explain the way you like something and they accomidate. Can't say enough about the owner and the service. Do yourself the favor and try."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been searching for a great new Mediterranean place, drove by one day and decided to try. What a disappointment. Service was terrible to start... Two cashiers and one was on the phone while we waited, not even acknowledging us. We placed a to-go order and they started to get a little busier. We waited 40 minutes! When the cashier handed us our food he told us to call ahead next time--like its our fault we had to wait and were inconveniencing them. Worst off, the food was bland and small--not worth the wait at all. Never again, no clue how this place is so highly rated."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the past 2 weeks and everything iv had here was amazing! The staff is awsome along with the food , I would highly recommend  anyone coming here if you haven't tried it, they have a huge variety of food , this is my new favorite place to eat!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just relocated here from Texas and was looking for a good restaurant to get Lebanese food, thank God I found this place. I'll definitely be a regular. :-)"}
{"text":"I came to check out this place today.
I eat a lot of Mediterranean and Greek food.
I was excited to try the food here.

I ordered the chicken skewers plate and the lentil soup.
There was one girl working behind the counter and she seemed nice and knowledgeable about the menu items.

The lentil soup was served first, as I requested. It is not a usual lentils soup. The lentils are actually pureed, you won't find whole lentil pieces. That's not bad, just an observation. There was a nice puree type of liquid, def some vinegar and lightly salted. Overall a great soup. Try it if you like lentils soup.

After 7, 8 minutes my plate was served. First, one minor issue - the girl forgot to add a fork. So I had to go back to the counter and ask for one.

The plate included numerous items - 2 chicken skewers, small salad, yellow rice, nicely baked whole tomato, baked and cut whole jalapeño pepper, and some kind of white cheese puree in the middle and also humus and pita bread.
I personally think there should be no jalapeños in any greek or Mediterranean food. So I removed it. The rice and humus were very good, the salad and tomato, also. But one of the chicken skewers was not cooked all the way, 3 of 4 pieses were a bit chewy. Def needed another 2 minutes on the grill.

The chicken was nicely seasoned and the good skewer tasted amazing. 

Also, the place is very clean, it's not small, there's plenty of room inside. There are napkins and some condiments on each table.

Overall I rate it 4 starts and I recommend it to anyone!
A great new Mediterranean food spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, always on time when I order delivery. Great food, not terrible prices. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was horrible !!!! The chicken was so dry I could hardly eat it. I ordered the chicken plate and the only thing that was edible was the hummus with pita bread and the salad. I wanted rice with my plate but it didn't come with it. We ended up with a side of rice and it was too old. It wasn't fresh. A year ago I used to rave about this place. It has definitely gone downhill!!! Don't order the lasagna ...it was cold and now my boyfriend is sick. It's  sad how good the food used to be and now it's terrible!!"}
{"text":"BEST chicken shawarma I have ever had....shhh...don't tell my Isralie mother-in-law...although hers is pretty darn good as well. 
THIS place however makes it soooooo good! I had the special, which was $1 off that day. It was a chicken shawarma sandwich on what looked like a grilled flatbread wrap. Was so juicy and tasty. Also, I had the rosewater sweet tea and it was amazing! My friend had the chicken kabob plate and it was $4 off that day. One grilled chicken skewer and one of ground chicken. They were both very tasty. The service was excellent as well and they offered samples to taste. The falafal was a bit dry but it would certainly not detur me from going back.
I would recommend this place to anyone and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I always get the kabob combo (1 chicken and 1 lamb) -- They both taste amazing and a glass of rose water ice tea to wash it all down is awesome! -- the plates come with hummus and tzatziki sauce and the fresh veggies goes KAPOW! in your mouth. Very flavorful. The owner/manager is a very nice guy as well -- Makell Bird, former employee of Trip Advisor (Viator)"}
{"text":"Don't order the chicken shwarma.. Too dry.. Haven't tried anything else but will give it a try again sometime."}
{"text":"I'm always craving for a Shawarma. Hubby and I were driving around during lunch hour and came across this place. All I can say is, less garlic is better. I can barely taste the other spices, which was such a disappointment- every bite all you taste and smell is the garlic. The chicken was moist and the pita was fresh, again... garlic took over all my sides and dishes. I've had better."}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly staff. The owner is very kind and he and the girl taking our orders made sure that we got exactly what we wanted for lunch. Service was very fast and the place is really clean. 

I got the falafel plate and substituted fries for my salad. The falafels were amazing and fresh. My pita bread was fresh and the hummus was delicious! Even the fries were good, they were seasoned perfectly so I didn't even bother to ask for ketchup. I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I have been to a many different places in many different cities for shawarma and this place does not measure up to them. The service was good but I was not
Impressed with the food."}
{"text":"Food and service were terrific, and the owners are super friendly. There's not a lot of good food places near my work so I'm definitely glad I found this one. Seating is also pretty good and I really like the casual atmosphere of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible, to say the least. The reason for two stars is the woman who takes the order, not only is she rude, and not personable. She is very argumentative. I ordered chicken shawarma wrap without tomatoes, my husband doesn't like them. I also ordered the shawarma pizza without them. 

My order comes out and I notice my pizza has tomatoes. So instantly check my husbands order, sure enough it had tomatoes. 

I take it up to her and tell her I asked for no tomatoes and she claims I never told her no tomatoes on pizza, and that the wrap -doesn't have tomatoes- the epic part was when I told her \"really it doesn't\" as I proceeded to pull out tomatoes from  the wrap. Then she without apologising turned and started speaking to the chef. They replaced the wrap. Anyways doesn't make you want to dine at this place. But the food is really extremely good. They just need someone else working the tables. 

She won't bring you the food out either, she just stands around. The chef actually brought the food out."}
{"text":"Nice and fresh foods. 4 of us went there yesterday evening and the guy explained everything nicely. We ordered chicken shwarma pizza, gyros, nuggets and sish kabob. The food was nice and the quantity was great as well."}
{"text":"I like all I have tried, its all tasty.  You must try this place, get healthy food!
 I had a problem in the past but the manager assured me he'll look into the problem and fix it."}
{"text":"The food took an hour to arrive and we are 1.5 miles away. I ordered the chicken combo and the falafel plate. The pita tasted like 3 day old bread. The falafel was not impressive and the chicken was on the dry side. The salad was the only decent thing.  Overall, a very disappointing meal."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving this place a 5 star is due to their chicken. I absolutely love their Gyros, but I just can't get over the taste of the chicken. It is too dry and the spices on it are just too much for me. They do offer reasonable prices and their Greek Salad is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Lebanese restaurant but for a place that is called Shawarma Plus and does not offer shawarma sandwiches (plates only) is very disappointing, knowing how easily they can add it to the menu. Prices are ok and service is friendly."}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service, clean dining, great tasting food. I ordered the Shawarma Plate with lamb, dad ordered 2 choice entree. Food is excellent. Top it off with dessert, Baklava....so many options."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to write a review about this place and I have to say after eating there 4 times, I can form a proper review. Last night I broke fast and had the vegetarian platter, which reminded me of the mezza platter I used eat in Dubai, except everything is on one plate.  The hummus and babaganoush was amazing, as well as the grape leaves stuffed with eggplant.  The flavors were tangy and fresh and the portions are big. I was full of yummy veggie goodness.  They also have meats such as lamb, beef and chicken kabobs.

This is a great place for vegetarians as well as vegans and meat eaters.  They also have a good selection of ready made Arabic/Lebanese food to take home.  

Best of all are the home made sweets which are made there fresh. I always leave with a box of fresh baklava.   

I have tried the falafel wrap and its's huge, the combo comes with fries and a drink.

This is a good casual place for breakfast, lunch and dinner, prices are good and food is always fresh.

I recommend this place if you are vegetarians or vegan.  Your meat eating friends will love it also."}
{"text":"I love this place. Fresh, and full of flavor. I wish I lived a little closer because I am always in the mood for Mediterranean food. 
Gyro yum, baklava, yum. Salads are always cold and refreshing and Fresh! I don't know how many times I've gone to places where the lettuce is pushing its life expectancy. So far so good here. The bowl is always two meals for me, and the desserts...I have yet to try the rice pudding because I am supposed to be low carbing when possible. But it looks delicious as well. Did I say baklava yum? Really such a delicate dessert and made right here."}
{"text":"Shawarma????? This is not even close to be named shawarma!!!
So dry with no flavor come on!!!
What I ate was dry chicken breast  in a wired sauce !"}
{"text":"Excellent service and awesome food. Definitely coming back here for Burgul wheat and baklava"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch.
Food is very good!
Good vegetarian options too (I'm not a vegetarian, but really like their falafel wrap)
Meat dishes are delicious!
Prices are good too!

Everyone should check it out!"}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago and have been meaning to go back since this place is so good! First of all the owner is a doll! I believe his name is Narij and we talked while they made my to-go order. He was so kind and you can tell he has a passion for his food. The food, by the way, is delicious!

My husband and I loved our shawarma restaurant when we lived in San Diego.  We recently moved to Las Vegas and have been searching for a Shawarma place out here. This is by far the best in town! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and tasted delicious. I definitely recommend eating the chicken with their garlic dipping sauce- so yummy. The pita was hot and fresh and I loved the pickled veggies. I will gladly come back to eat their delicious food, but its also a business worth supporting because the owner clearly cares about great customer service and making a good product!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Boston and I found this gem, great foo, great staff! Get the tabbouleh!!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Place was clean! And service was fast and the owner was incredibly gracious and friendly!"}
{"text":"Changed ownership. Now called fresh kabob. Only Persian/afghan food now. Still good though."}
{"text":"I am always on a hunt for a new Mediterranean place. My first visit at Shawarma Plus was a pleasant one! The staff was helpful in helping me decide what to order. Since it was my first visit and I live on the other side of town, I ordered 2 meals. What can I say? Mediterranean meals are usually health conscious to begin with anyway :)

Sides: 4/5
I ordered a side of tabbouleh and it was fantastic! It was fresh and had a great balance of flavor to it. The lentil with rice was mixed in with tomatoes and grilled onions. I wish they can balance out the ratio. It was too much lentil for my taste, and the flavor was just okay. 

Gyro beef/lamb sandwich: 3/5
This sandwich came in wrapped like a burrito. The meat was thinly sliced with a mild spice to it. It came in with the traditional veggies - tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, etc. The garlic creamy white sauce was mild. I wasn't a fan of the thin pita wrapper used. To me it was dry and was served not as warm as I would like it to be despite of the nice grilled marks on it. 

2 combo choice: 5/5
Oh my! This was my first try of moussaka and it was delicious! It has a great combination of lamb, spices, cheese and the custard sauce on it was the cherry on top for me! So good! 
The other choice was the stuffed zucchini with beef and rice filling. This was also delicious with a mild spice marinara sauce.

I would be a returning customer for sure. They have a decent menu to choose from and I can't wait to try their deserts!"}
{"text":"Love this place the food is great the staff is friendly and it's always clean  
Fresh food and friendly service this place is consistent with both quality and service"}
{"text":"My Dear Naji.You have done it again.You have the Midas touch.Just ate there and had the Falafel plate.Kate had the Shawarma. This place rocked, Everything is fresh and made with care.This Mediterranean restaurant will tempt the palate to return and try different dishes.Call in and order,pick up and be transported to incense and kohl.You will see us again and again. Congrats.!!
Loni Andal"}
{"text":"I've eaten so many of greek and mediterranean restaurant and this place is not even close.  Food is not good and waitress is not responsive.  She seems not knowing what was ordered.  Avoid!"}
{"text":"The chef makes some mean tahini sauce. Very cordial and friendly. Yummy food! We had their chicken skewer platter and falafel side. Hummus and falafels were on point."}
{"text":"The 5 star reviews are extremely deceiving. I am middle eastern so trust me when I tell you to stay away from the food here. We spent over $100 on sandwiches and 2 plates which is fine if we had received quality food. First of all the beef shawerma is not real shawerma which is cooked on a a rotating cone in front of a flame. It's pieces of meat sautéed in spices that are def NOT shawerma spices. But forget that. The real issue is all of the food is doused in SALT. The food was sooooo salty that none of us could eat it.  Horrible! Even the tabouli was so salty we could not eat it. Worse experience I have ever had.  Also I noticed when I got home that the owner, who took my order, over charged my by $2 an item. WTH!??  Def never going back!"}
{"text":"As the 2 star comment refers: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" Not a fan. Stopped in here for lunch on a Friday around noon time. Was pretty busy but seemed to get through the food line & pay pretty fast. Sat at a table until they called my number to get my Chicken Shawarma sandwich & fries. Took about 7-10 minutes for them to call our numbers which wasn't too bad considering there was quite a few people in there. Chicken Shawarma was so dry & had a lot of salt type seasoning on it that made me keep downing my water. I've had better shawarma before & would rather spend my money at those places. A nice plus was that they did bring out free samples of Baklava to try."}
{"text":"Shawarma Plus is easily the best mediterranean cafe I've been to in Vegas/ Henderson area! VERY AUTHENTIC FOOD! Everything tastes like a home-cooked meal, and is cooked fresh every day. My absolute favorite is the chicken shawarma sandwich with the garlic sauce! SO GOOD! I also love the filet kabobs and the kafta kabobs! Very clean!! Awesome staff who welcomes you and remembers you by name. Quick and cheap, but also super healthy. You really can't go wrong with anything there. If you haven't been here, trust me, YOU ARE MISSING OUT!!!!"}
{"text":"All in all pretty good, I had the lamb platter and everything on it was freshly made and tasty. Bread was a little thin but it was late in the day Sunday so that just might have been my bad luck. Will def be back to try the fresh baklava I saw coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":":-) love their shawarwa we eat there all the time the thini is really good and the lamp shawrwa rap is amazing and the price is fair too 5+ stars keep the good work and the good food"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in town and I've tried them all. Such friendly staff as well. Fresh to death hummus etc. did I mention they have rose water iced tea . This spot takes me to my shawarma happy place."}
{"text":"I ordered shawarma and it came with no shawarma
I left the place starving 
please next time put more meat and if you want to charge more charge more"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place got 4 stars.. I should've looked at the recent reviews. 
Came into this establishment feeling super excited to eat some good Lebanese/Mediterranean food.  save your money and go somewhere else !!  
Service was so so terrible.  The girl at the cashier with the pink hat is extremely rude!! I can understand if we were being difficult but we weren't at all. 
If you are contemplating whether to eat here or not , listen to all the folks with the 1 star reviews!"}
{"text":"First time here and loved it! Great food and very friendly! :) The gyro rice bowl was delicious! definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"ordered lamb gyro and 2 meat pies with beef during lunch hr and i was quiet disappointed. first of all, meat pie with beef was more like size of pot stickers. name was deceiving, picture posted looked way bigger than the actual pie and on top of that, its not even hot. it tasted cold like they just took out of fridge. lamb gyro was warm at best. because it tasted good, im not giving it 1 star. needless to say, im disappointed and will not go back."}
{"text":"The tilapia was very fresh and moist. The Greek salad was very fresh and delicious.  Great dressing. Lots of flavor and the lettuce was very crisp. The olives very a bit tart but compliments the feta cheese quite nicely. Overall definitely a repeat.  The fresh brewed rose tea was the best. You could really taste a difference n"}
{"text":"After all of the RAVE reviews, I expected more. I ordered the Gyro combo (Pita Bread with lamb meat) with salad instead of fries and a Zucchini boat dish with Hamburger. Well let's just say, I was underwhelmed. 

- The Gyro was decent. I got the \"wrapped\" Gyro, the bread was crispy and that was nice. I have never had pickles on my Gryo and the sauce was not thick as it should have been.  The Gyro was okay, not to my liking. 
- The fries, well I didn't order fries but a salad and they were very similar to \"shoestring\" fries and cold, not tasty
- The Zucchini boat -well nothing to speak on, would never try this again. 

All in all, not somewhere I would entertain again, should have just stuck with Subway which is right next door."}
{"text":"The service was good; the girl at the counter didn't seem too knowledgable about the menu but was more than happy to find out the answers to any question you could come up with by asking the chef on duty. She was really nice, 1 star.

The food however, it was just okay. Maybe even on the lower end of the totem pole of all the greek food I've ever had. Devastation. I really wanted to love this place since it was so close to home. 

I had the Chicken Shawarma plate. After reading rave reviews about the garlic sauce served with the chicken, I decided against my typical order of a lamb/beef gyro. Half the chicken was dry, the garlic dip didn't save the chicken, THE HUMMUS WAS AWESOME, but there was only 1 piece of thin pita served with the plate which wasn't enough even just for the hummus *sad face*. On top of everything else, the rice was pretty bland. 

Let's get down to it.. Would I come back? Maybe.. Probably not on my own though, I'll need some kind of convincing. I'll order the beef/lamb gyro next time. By the way, where was the feta?!  For $15 (including a drink), I want feta!!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food ever , try beef and lamb and grape leaves, I enjoyed each bite of my lunch 
Thank you"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma sandwich here is amazing! I am used to world class shawarma and this place can hang. Also reasonably priced and quick."}
{"text":"Call ahead for a take out order. I've been here 20 minutes and there is only 2 other customers and the two girls who work here don't seem to be doing anything. How long does it take to make one sandwich!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last week and I'll definitely be back!! Everything is so fresh and delicious. I love the shawarma chicken and lamb.
I'll be taking all my friends there. Even the environment is great.
The store is vibrant and fun, I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"The food at this place is amazing. My favorite is the Chicken shawarma! I bring all my friends and family to this restaurant! The staff is friendly and very professional. Very delicious food, don't hesitate to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"So all was great beside the price. I got the lunch special was 2 sides a salad and pizza. I also got a small baklava but the price for it all came out to 21.35. Didn't seem right at all. A lunch special for over 20 dollars? From what I understood was the price was 10.99 for all that but he snuck another 5.99 for I dont know what. He told me it was for the pizza. So to not have a confrontation I just paid the man and moved on. But be careful for the overcharge. Other then that the food was good. 

**Edited review because the owner contact me and mentioned the price break down. Still 5.99 for a slice of pizza is a bit much."}
{"text":"I go to order dinner tonight and we placed an order. They confirm it and then called 20 minutes later saying their closed. I'm sorry but the order was put in before you closed and if you were closed why was your UBER EATS STILL OPEN! Never eat here!! They legit confirmed the order, why do that and then cancel and call 20 minutes later. Now my money is tied up with Uber eat and this shit hole"}
{"text":"Shawarma? You mean fried bologna? When I walk into a restaurant and order a shawarma plate, I don't expect fried bologna style gyro meat like you get in the food court at the mall. Gross!

Hummus? Just okay. Nothing special there. Salad.... weak. Feel ripped off."}
{"text":"In the short time I was there it was pretty awful. I went to their restroom to wash my hands and it was filthy. The sink was clogged, it was half way full of dirty water. The lady who took my order wasn't very friendly. After I got my food togo, I arrived back at work to find my vegetarian shawarma was just a bunch of brown gross wilted veggies. The lettuce was brown and slimy and the tomatoes didn't look fresh all, they were slimy and mushy as well. I contemplated going back to return my shawarma and show them how gross it looked, but I only have a short break for lunch. Extremely disappointed and grossed out!!"}
{"text":"Great food and the people who work there are very courteous. This is my new spot for kabobs and shawarma. Prices are very reasonable for the portions and quality!"}
{"text":"Shawarma plus is amazing! In the last 2 months, I've eaten here at least 7 or 8 times. Every time I order either a chicken shawarma or my favorite gyro, which I absolutely love at shawarma plus. I find it hard to find a good gyro, and especially a good shawarma. Prices are very affordable, there is always parking available, and the service is quick and extremely friendly! The owner sometimes will serve you food himself, and always got a smile on his face! I will keep coming here in the future, and recommended this place to anyone who likes a good shawarma, or gyro! A+++"}
{"text":"I drove by this spot a few times and I've been wanting to try it so I stopped today and I got to say the food was amazing. I ordered the  stuffed cabbage and stuffed zucchini meal and tasted really good. I highly recommend this place for good Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"The best mediterranean food I've tried here in Las Vegas! The food is fresh and they have a lot of selections.The owner is really nice and very accommodating. The place is clean and very inviting too! Everybody should try their food! I rarely give reviews, buteveryone needs to know about Shawarma Plus! Me and my husband had a great experience. Happy tummies here!"}
{"text":"On a whim my husband and I stopped by Shawarma Plus for a late dinner. What a treat! The staff here are so kind and sweet and the food equally amazing. I had the Greek salad, shawarma, and baklava and all are worth having again. Excellent food, excellent prices, excellent people."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying Shawarma Plus and it definitely won't be my last! Based on other reviews I think it's safe to say Naji was the gentleman who helped us and before I even ordered my food I knew I wanted to come back. He was so kind and so helpful. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Gyro combo, one with fries and the other with a salad. Everything was delicious! The gyro was so flavorful and my salad was fresh and crisp. The fries are what surprised me the most! Dare is say they are better than McDonalds? At the end of our meal I went to ask for a to-go bag and thanked Naji for everything. He was so happy to hear that I enjoyed everything that he gave me 2 Baklava, one for myself and the other for my boyfriend. I had never had one before and I'm so glad I was able to try them because they are delicious. I will definitely be ordering some on my next visit! I'm glad we found this gem."}
{"text":"Hubs had a beef/lamb gyro. He eats Mediterranean for lunch about 2X per week and he said it was very good. I had a falafel sandwich. I give it a 3.5 I'm not sure if they are normally warm but I think it would have been better warm. We split an order of fries. Both of us were stuffed! Price was average for this kind of place. I looked online for a menu but the website wasn't very helpful. It's close to my house so I know we will go again."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean or any type of food ever. I love everything on their menu but the best is stuffed eggplant, burgul wheat and the shawarma sandwiches. Their tabouleh and hummus is to die for. I love this restaurant. Best in Vegas or anywhere. Come try it out."}
{"text":"Somehow I visited the new location across town (on Eastern) before realizing they have a second location AND it's closer to me! The same wonderful staff and garlic sauce are now just 6.2 miles away from me at any given moment. 

Unfortunately, I would say that I do prefer the newer location though both have awkward parking lots. The staff remembered me from previous visits, which was awesome. I always get the same thing: chicken shwarma wrap, extra garlic sauce.

I found it odd that this location, like the other, is set up like Subway where you can watch them make your food- yet my dish was made and wrapped up in the kitchen, brought out to me bagged and ready to go. Props for speed but would have loved to customize my wrap and add cucumber.

Don't forget to grab salads, sauces, dips, and sides from the refrigerated case before you go! Everything is super fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Henderson I have to stop here.  I love how fresh and tasty everything is... The shwarma is very juicy and has lots of flavor. Staff is also very helpful and friendly.. If you are in the mood for some amazing mediterranean food definitely check this place out.. DONT FORGET THE GARLIC SAUCE.. YUMMY"}
{"text":"The first location I tried was in Henderson.  That place was actually good but then again it had just opened.  Their gyro and falafel were delicious.  Perfectly seasoned and great texture.  Which would make me give them 4.5 stars. I kind of wonder if it will go downhill like the location on decatur that had been there for a while. Makes me sad.  :(


I went to the location on Decatur and all I can say is OMG....did anyone taste the food?  I took a bite of their \"lasagna\" and all I got was salt and cinnamon.  Eewwwww. I do not like cinnamon in my savory food and I wished the lady at the covet would've told me about the cinnamon as if I knew I would not have gotten it.  Then I thought maybe their falafel would be good like the other location. Nope....falafel was salty as well.  Sadness.....:( 

And I was so hoping that this place would be good since it is so close to my house.  *sigh*

Sitting at home now drinking a gallon of water to offset the salt I ate.  Blah


So no pics.  Nothing was good enough that I wanted to take a picture of it.  :("}
{"text":"I finally had the time to stop in and try them out, and let me tell you they are the best I've had by far!! Like a home cooked meal...the staff is super friendly and there's was no long wait. I highly recommend shawarma plus!!"}

{"text":"Not impressed! Plates are small! Stick with gyros sandwiches and falafels. Plates are small portions and overpriced. Place is ok, looks clean and people are nice!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to not give any stars! My friend and I were so excited to try this place as we were craving Mediterranean. We went during our lunch break which is at noon, it said it opens at 10 am. We parked, a family of four parked next to us. We walk in and the place was empty! We kinda thought cool, no lunch crowd! As I look around, all the cases where food should be were empty! I asked my friend, \" did they just open?\"  A girl walks towards the counter from the back and who appears to be cook looks through the door, both appear to be Latin ( I'm Mexican). Neither one has a smile or an inviting expression. My friend asks her if she has chicken, says yes. So we begin to order.... My friend says she's like the chicken.... The girl stops her says...oH sorry we don't have chicken.

Whaaat??!! Whhhaaat? What!??!!! Did you just not answer yes? 

We looked at each other, looked and her and literally walked out!!! We were pretty much in shock at how awful it really was here. We wanted check it out for ourselves even though the review posted a few days prior talked  about how awful an experience it was. They certainly were right!! 

As we get in the car...the family of 4 also walked out too!

Sucked we wasted our lunch time to get there from out office for no food! We ended having to go drive through in a hurry cause so much time was wasted!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant ! Their kabobs are great and there have such a variety. They have an awesome and welcoming staff as well as a great environment for families !"}
{"text":"Probably the worst meal I've ever had.  We came upon this place as we were driving down Decatur looking for lunch.  I've always loved Mediterranean food.  The man at the counter was very nice and told us what our options were.  We decided to get the special.  The food was swimming in oil.  I received 1 meat patty, 1 single stuffed zucchini and salad with a pile of greasy fried potatoes for $10.  I could only eat the meat patty and salad and left hungry.  My daughter had the same only with rice instead of lettuce.  She was only able to eat the patty and rice.  What little I was able to eat, I still felt grease inside my mouth and all over my lips.  I can't believe they charged us $10 for a tiny patty and zucchini.  Horrible food!"}
{"text":"me and my fiance wanted to try something different... and shawarma plus is good
place to starT... i got the beef and lamb shawarma and my fiance got the kebab plate.. my shawarma was so moist and was very flavorful... it usually comes w/ fries but i decided to hold off on the fries... the flavor was combination of smoky/aromatic/ and juicy... my fiancées plate was good too.. her shish kebab chicken and beef combination had the same effect on my palate all in all the food was good and the ambiance is also nice.. combine that with a friendly staff..."}
{"text":"My favorite cuisine is Mediterranean, and my favorite dish is chicken shwarma. I'll always compare every place I try it to the place I fell in love with it: a strong and delicious garlic sauce is mandatory, as is fresh-baked bread.

The chicken shwarma here is legit- get it as a wrap, and the garlic sauce is spot-on! They also have it available for purchase in a small refrigerator case, along with hummus, tabouli, dolmas, and other small dishes.

Service was polite, pricing was fair. Only criticism of the wrap was that the bread tore apart a bit easily, so it can get messy. They have a $4 lunch special for a FRIED chicken shwarma wrap, which sounds bizarre... but if it has the garlic sauce, I bet it's good!"}
{"text":"I love to come here for my Mediterranean cuisine fix! When I have cravings for falafel, hummus, tabouli, dolmas and smokey baba ghanouge and baklava, I come here...so delicious! And the owner & operator is so delightful...that's a bonus!"}
{"text":"Finally - a place in Henderson to get great chicken shawarma!!  The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Very good shawarma! Excellent customer service. The baklava is amazing. Authentic Mediterranean Flavor. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Of course one of the best Shawarma in Montreal comes from a little stand in a mall. I only get the Chicken Shawarma plate here but it's worth the four stars. The meat is perfectly cooked, not too dry, with plenty of spice (and that's without the garlic sauce... you must get the garlic sauce). You also have a choice of carbs (I typically get just the potatoes but the rice is also good), and salad (I go for the mixed cabbage). On a weekday you will find yourself eating among a meat market of Dawson's finest. Great choice if you need something to eat during a trip to Winners or Canadian Tire!"}
{"text":"The service is nice. However Ive been spolied at other Mediterranean places. I feel the gyro could be better. The pita bread is too thin leaving the gyro more of a cruncy feel. The chicken I had was good, but my boyfriend said its too bland. The feta cheese was placed more in one area of the gyro making it too strong. And gyro was rolled like a burrito. Not mu cup of tea. The fries were good because the oil was good. They are thin fries with the lowery type of seasoning. They the white yogurt looking wauce, but it was made very liquidy. Again not my cup of tea, its too drippy, not good duppong sauce. My boyfriends gyro was beef and lamb. I dont like lamb and when I tried it, I didnt taste the lamb. Thats why my boyfriend disnt like his gyro. He said no flavor and you dont taste the lamb, which he loves. The rice was good, but it was a bit dry. Still I loved rice and hard to screw up. Im writing this review because they have an advertisement that if you write a review you get a free dessert. Sorry guys Im not happy with the gyro taste here. Will I come back? Yes the service is friendly, and I will not order the gyros, perhaps I will find something good. Oh btw the tea is good. Has an anise flavor."}
{"text":"Very nice family owned and authentic, great food, awesome service and very pleasant atmosphere far superior to the other option just down the road.  Prices very reasonable at $6 - 10 per entree, I will return!"}
{"text":"If you are reading this review trying to decide what to order, do yourself a favor and get the chicken shawarma. It's juicy and flavorful and comes with the most delicious garlic sauce. You can get it in a pita as a sandwich or on a plate, but just be sure to get that delicous sauce. You're welcome. :) 

Although the chicken is my usual go to, I decided to try something different on my most recent visit. I went with the lamb shawarma plate and it was really delicous and filling. It had a generous helping of gyro meat, hummus, pita, tzatziki sauce and salad all on one plate. Think bento box. The price, $12.99, does not include a drink and one will set you back another $1.99. I think the price is right for the amount of food you get, but I wish it included a drink. 

Once you order you get a number and they call you when it's ready. I was mildly annoyed when I realized that to-go orders were being sent out before dine in orders, regardless of who was there first. My buddies and I waited about 15 minutes for our food. Not a huge deal for me, but my coworker only gets a 30 minute lunch so he had to scarf it down. I am wondering what the hold up is with this place and why they are so slow in getting orders out. The meal I ordered was not anything that had to be cooked. I guess I'll file this under questions I'll never get the answers to. Oh and they have this big ass fan in the dining room, it's really called big ass fan. Anyway I was looking at it cause it's cool how big it is, and I noticed the blades are caked in dust. Not very appealing considering its in a restaurant and that dust could fall onto the tables into the food. I think someone needs to get a big ass ladder and a big ass duster and take care of that. Regardless of that, I'll likely be back."}
{"text":"Hearing from multiple people how outstanding the food and customer service is, I was not disappointed for my first stop by. Growing up and eating Mediterranean food avidly, I did not find anything that hit home like this place! The customer service is beyond phenomenal, not to mention how pristine clean the restaurant is kept! I will be sure to come back multiple times!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and I am happy. It's clean, the gentleman up front was very helpful, and the food I ordered was super yummy. I had this cream lasagna type food with spinach and mushrooms. Total score, my two favorite veggies, and beef with egg plant. I like that they do carry out as well. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I drive passed this place everyday. It used to be called something like Meat Chicks & Wieners, which might be the worst name for a restaurant ever! I was happy when it went out of business, because I was hoping something good would replace it, since it's sooo close to my house. I was very happy to drive by and see Shawarma Plus was replacing it. I am usually a fan of anything Mediterranean, but I did not expect it to be this good. It has been open roughly a month and I probably been there 10 times. It's beginning to be a routine and is definitely a go to for quick and delicious food that never disappoints. I wish I could give them 6 stars. The owner works the counter himself and seems to be a very good hardworking guy. It's local small businesses like this that put a smile on my face. I wish them great success and I'll be happy to be a regular. Oh and try the baklava, seriously!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a shawarma place around so when I found this place I was HYPED! The first time I visited I had the chicken shawarma. It was dry so I had to dump a load of tahini on it. I took a small order of baklava home and was disappointed. It was dry as a bone and was all dough and hardly any filling.

The second time I went I had a gyro. Again, extremely dry. I bought another small order of baklava again to see if it was any better than the last time, but it wasn't. It was super dry with all phillo dough and no filling.

I gave this three stars because the one great thing about this place is the service. Nice people work there.

I'm not sure I'll go back because my two visits weren't the best. Hopefully I can find a better place. Especially for baklava."}
{"text":"I have had shawarma all around the world and this place in my top 5 places for shawarma/gyro meat! The service is awesome, the staff always suggests things, they never had my order wrong (although it's not hard to listen and get the condiments right,) and the food is always fresh and delicious. The meats are not overly salty or seasoned, the lettuce and veggies are crisp with the tzatzki sauce. I would definitely suggest this place to the locals and the tourists. I always go here at least once every 2 weeks for my Mediterranean fix. It's a lot more affordable than the higher end places."}
{"text":"I've had the plates here a couple of times and wanted to put my 2 cents.

I went during the rush hour at noon, long lineup means food is gonna be fresh.

Prices are about a dollar less per plate than some Amir's, about $9 for chicken or beef shawarma.
I got the combo for $10.

A plus for me with these middle-eastern places that dot the city is the variety, they have a few dishes that you might not find elsewhere.They have 2 types of rice, and 5-6 types of salad, you also get potatoes, all are pretty good.

The meat was good, nothing amazing, but the quantity was a bit lacking.
The hummus and garlic sauce was some of the worst i've had in a long time.
They also charge 50 cents for bread, which i found weird."}
{"text":"This place is OFFICIAL! Looks a bit colorful on the exterior with all the signs, but some of the best Gyros in town!"}
{"text":"Keep driving....this place was not good at all. I went with a few co workers and no one enjoyed their food except one. I had the lamb gyro which was ok. The lamb was cooked and season well but the wrap broke so I had to use a fork. That was the only thing that was ok."}
{"text":"I ordered two plates to-go:  the kafta plate with salad: no rice, no fries as pictured and discussed with the cashier. The second plate was falafel. When I got home, the kafta plate had a big serving of rice and the falafel plate had a 3 1/2 inch hair in the hummus. I called the cashier and she started making excuses, then said she would speak to owner and call me back. She took my name and number. Lot of good that did!  Lot of talk, no customer service.They were not busy at the time I ordered."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food and great service!!! Ordered large Greek salad, lentil dish, and pinto beans with meat balls.  All had great flavor. Will definitely be back when back in town. Kudos to manager!"}
{"text":"We went to this place on Sunday and it was amazing!!!! The owner of the place was there and he was really patient and sweet. We went in and there was a really cute design inside. Then the owner he told us everything on the menu and recommended the good stuff on the menu. At the end of all of this we ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich(it also came with the French fries). Then we ordered the chicken kabob. This plate came with the choice of hummus, salad/tabouli, and rice. This plate was very delicious. Finally we got a Mediterranean burger. This burger was soooo amazing that it is better then most burger places in my opinion! My burger also came with fries and they were amazing! With this order we also got two drinks! He recommend the iced tea that is made there!! It was very delicious! At the end this place is really amazing and delicious!! I will be returning here!"}
{"text":"Their chicken shawarma is actually pretty good... I've been looking for good shawarma for a while and finally found it! Their garlic sauce adds great flavor and creaminess to each bite. 

I ordered a chicken shawarma (sandwich/wrap only) without pickles and wrapped with a pretty thin pita, which I love for a low carb meal, then the whole thing is grilled for a nice outer crisp texture. 

So, You got a wrap with texture, creamy garlic flavor, crunch from the lettuce, with fresh tomatoes, and chicken roasted on a spit. That's all you need for a great bite to eat. 

O and friendly courteous service!"}
{"text":"I love Greek food! This place is not as great as the Mad Greek, but pretty good. I went here for dinner and everyone seemed friendly and when I had questions, knew the answers.

The food was good and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Not the best Mediterranean food I've had. Staff tried pushing their pre-made style food. Ordered greek fries and received regular fries. Greek salad came with no feta and no olives, rice was oily, gyro meet was cut thick, pita was a bit doughy, and hummus was watery. Overall taste pallete was bland. Upon leaving, no thank you or anything.  I would not come back. If you guys are ever in Phoenix AZ, check out Greek Wraps or Mikas Greek."}
{"text":"I have always wanted too check Shawarma Plus Mediterranean Cuisine off my bookmark. I literally past by it just about every weekend off during my months of training going out to the Lake or Henderson. It located right off I-215 just off Decatur off ramp in small shopping mall. I always have my apprehensions about new places ones that hardly see any cars out front in the  parking lot. But I never judge a book by its cover alone. 

I love my greek/mediterranean food. My usually go spot little farther away from home so was hoping that found one just as good. Shawarma only down the road for me.  I only had the Shawarma Beef Sandwich on this visit. It was awesome! I was unsure whether to get the plate or sandwich. I came for lunch went with the sandwich, All the sandwich choices you can make combo with fries/soda for $2.99. The fries really nothing special but wanted drink so like combo me up. The sandwich itself nice size so really no need for fries. Just me. The sandwich had choice between beef or lamb went with the beef. The pita bread that grilled (the bread of the sandwich) that could eat by itself with some of the hummus (one things no doubt look forward too coming back trying or take some to go). You add the beef, Tahini Sauce, Tomato, Parsley, Pickles, Onions, Sumac. All these fresh ingredients. Eat bite taste the crunch of fresh pickles, nice slices of tomato, and the sauce brings it all together. It was one of the best pita bread roll up ever for me. 

The interior talk about kind of all over the place between the cartoonist logo, four arcades games spread out in the restaurant (pac-man good choice classic that never gets odd), couple widescreen up top can catch whatever spots game is on, and then have salad bar area (you can build your own salad; I saw lot of fresh great looking items choose from), hot area again you can build your own, great display of authentic greek dessert from the CLASSIC baklava and knafeh (I have no idea that this is but looked just as good as the baklava), and top it all grab-n-go area cold items like hummus to tabouleh can take home. Not in huge sizes so that nice cause just right amount not go to waste. I like that have options for everyone. They even have vegetarian dishes (not many restaurant have on there set menus).

The service was fabulous! I was asking few questions since first time but he was really nice, friendly, and not asked for better service. The prices are reasonable. No doubt plan on added Shawarma to my regular lunch spots close to home!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim and became an instant fan.  This is the kind of place I will go and try every item on the menu.  I loved the lentil soup.  I had it with falafel, which was very good.  You'd be amazed how many places mess up falafel,  The service was quick and friendly and though I was surprised my soup, falafel and small drink came to $12 it was worth it."}
{"text":"I was driving by and in need of sustinence for myself and my family after a morning basketball game.  My gyro was ok and reasonably priced at $6.99 -- tho a little salty.  HOWEVER:  (1) my baklava tasted stale despite the freshness date -- which makes me suspect that they relabel? Plus $3.99 for 4 small pieces is steep, especially considering they weren't even good!  I don't think they used real butter.  (2) my son's kabobs took a LONG time even tho the place was pretty empty (only 2 other tables were occupied). (3) portions in general were small.  Each a la cart skewer was $3.99 but each skewer had only 4 dice-sized squares of meat with tiny, almost unrecognizable veggies wedged in between--and all on top of a shallow bed of shredded lettuce and perhaps salad dressing?  My 14-year old son did NOT enjoy these because he wanted them plain.  (4) My husband's \"plate\" was served in a wide, cafeteria-style tray with little compartments.  It included hummus, salad, main, garlic sauce.  Portions were small but spread out by the compartments.  We were not fooled or amused.  4) it seemed like there was 1 man to take orders, make food, AND deliver to our table--service was very slow. Perhaps that's why he kept trying to persuade us to order food from their Panda Express-like display.  

Overall I can only give 2 stars because while some of the food was passable, the service, portion size, and value were lacking."}
{"text":"I went here on Sunday 3/27 around 5 or 6pm and the gyro I bought was so juicy and fresh! I am a big lamb gyro critic and this one has to be one of the best ones I've had. The lady who rung me up and took my order was also very nice and deserves a raise! Coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This is why it's hard to try new things! The 9.99 combo they highly promote is sad. There are about five unappealing options. I got the potatoes, meatballs and Greek salad. The meat was so over cooked it had the texture of a rubber ball but the potatoes and beans were so under cooked they were crunchy. The combo doesn't include a drink so that was an extra 2 bucks and most of the choices hadn't had the syrup changed. They also charge a dollar for a teaspoon of hummus. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Nice retro decor and convenient location off the 15. Portions were small and, we paid about $50 for three meals and one kid's meal."}
{"text":"The owner here is nice; however he will try to pull a quick one on you and make every meal a combo even though you didn't ask for one."}
{"text":"Nice spot to grab a quick gyro or plate.  Their beef and lamb shawarma is excellent. There aren't many places that serve it this way, so it's good to know that there is one that isn't as far away from me as the others are.  I would definitely recommend this spot if you love some quick Mediterranean food.  Only downside was that they had a pretty small menu. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everything is so tasty, great food and service. I just found my new spot and it's right down the street from work 
We'll be there tomorrow again"}
{"text":"The vegetarian plate is right on! You can tell everything is fresh, made in house. The baklava is unlike any I've had. Awesome spot for mediterranean chow. The shwarma pizza is fire."}
{"text":"Best quick mediterranean food in Vegas Id say. Love the gyro here and lentil soup. Kabobs salads and hummus are a must! Brings us back everytime"}
{"text":"Best Hummus ever! Creamy and delicious. The Greek salad was absolutely fantastic. Will definitely be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"I grew up in Glendale,Ca which is predominately   Armenian/Middle Eastern so Middle Eastern food is my absolute favorite. I've searched and searched for great quality (as authentic as can be) Middle Eastern food since I moved to Vegas a little over a year ago and haven't found anything good; until TODAY!!!!!


My husband told me about Shawarma Plus and I was skeptical until I tried the food. I had a Shawarma sandwhich and omg it was so delicious. 

I tried the garlic sauce (which is always a must) and it was fresh and you can tell that it's homemade. 

I don't always eat Baklava because it's usually too sweet for my liking, the Baklava here gets 5 stars also. 

To top it all off, the owner and everyone else are super nice and welcoming.

I will frequent Shawarma Plus often, that's for darn sure. 

Thank you."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this review four stars because the customer service at Shawarma Plus is excellent! The restaurant environment is casual, clean, and relaxed. The light atmosphere is enhanced by three old-school arcade machines, which is nice to have if kids are dining in with you. The menu offers the standard variety of food you expect from a place called Shawarma Plus. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate. It was okay. I think the chicken could have been juicier and more flavorful, but it was decent and certainly no where near bad. I didn't care for the side garlic sauce, which was disappointing because I have had it elsewhere and loved it. I asked for a side of gyro sauce, and it also wasn't up to par as far as my taste standards go- a little on the watered down side. However, all-in-all, the meal was good, and I will definitely return.  I think the weekend hours are not great; people in Vegas want to eat in places like Shawarma Plus after 7 p.m. on the weekend.  Closing at 7 is almost a slap in the face lol. This place does deliver, and it is worth the delivery fee. They should add a chicken gyro to their menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a friend. Food was amazing and such a great value.

We both had the lamb, beef, and chicken shawarma plates with a side of falafel and baklava for dessert. Every bite was amazing."}
{"text":"Its been well over a year since they first opened this location, I figured hey everyone deserves a second try, my first visit I wasn't so impressed by the food, so last night I went in and got their beef/lamb plate and ordered an extra order of French fries... First of all y'all now have different French fries than what you had when you first opened, I liked those French fries way better that you had when you first opened. Now they are different.. Plus, the meat still not that great in my opinion... Salad and vegetables on plate seemed fresh, tasted good... But overall still not really impressed with the meat. Sorry guys, I tried again after my first visit figuring maybe things had improved, service is very good and clean/tidy restaurant but not very impressed with the food."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food I have had in a long time. Had the kabob with lamb and chicken. Everything was excellent and the service was also great."}
{"text":"Ok so the staff is friendly but the service sucks n the food is eh....
Walked in and greeted right away. Asked if we'd ever been there before.
Nope, so they made suggestions...
Um not so great. That side salad that comes with their lunches is horrible. Wilted yellow yucky lettuce. 
Stingy on their gyro meat.
Kabobs are overcooked and dry.
Won't be going here again."}
{"text":"You should definitely try their chicken nuggets. Unlike any other I've had before. The shwarma doesn't give me heartburn (most places do) which is a plus. The desserts are tasty, as well."}
{"text":"The good:
Chicken and beef shawarma plates.
Excellent hummus
The bad:
Stay away from the \"buffet\" items. Cold greasy and dry traditional Middle Eastern food.
A little overpriced if comparing to Parsleys on Sunset.

I have been here twice. First time I would give them 2 stars due to the fact I ordered the buffet items.  Second time here I ordered the shawarma plates and now give it 3.5 to 4 stars"}
{"text":"Super clean and oh so yummy!
Now that I work nearby I eat here almost every day. the food is great and the owner is so wonderful. I always get the Harissa for dessert. its a sweet little bite of heaven.
The only reason a star was lost is because the french fires is always very greasy. other than that I love to eat there."}
{"text":"Got two falafel wraps to go and found a fly in mine. We get to go food from this place often but sadly will not be anymore."}
{"text":"Great portions, good food. Never leave hungry. Come here about once a week for lunch and always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Shawarma is one of my favorite but this time with shawarma plus, taste was not good. It taste like a Mexican food, Mediterranean flavor is different from Spanish cuisine."}
{"text":"I have been here six times before, and usually it is good, but today is my last time going there.  i ordered a lamb/beef gyro sandwich and got chicken, which i am allergic too.  obviously, you can't tell what meat is in there until you take a bite, but no mistake, it wasn't what i ordered.  i went up to the counter and returned, and told them it wasn't what i ordered and i am allergic to chicken; no apology at that time.  15 minutes went by and still no new gyro.  i went up and just asked for my money back, the cashiers were apologetic this time, but then the cook came and was telling me in a loud voice that he called my number \"100 times\", 98, 98, 98, my order was 97, nice try!  horrible customer service.  and the chicken that made it in my mouth before i spit it out was super dry."}
{"text":"Woke up early and wanted a gyro! Found this place on Yelp! Love that they were open earlier than most lunch spots. Had a gyro with a salad and hummus! Everything was delicious! The owner was super friendly and informative about all their menu items! My boyfriend and I left with full bellies and also took home more food for later and baklava for desert! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. First off, location is great but best of all the food is amazing! It's a breath of fresh air to find a middle eastern place that doesn't serve dry falafel. It's nice and moist here and goes down as a quick, filling and healthy snack in a wrap.

They have a bunch of other dishes under a heat lamp at the front which, if you're not familiar with the place, may look intimidating. -but I assure you it shouldn't. The owner is very hands on and makes sure that everything is and stays fresh. Moussaka is great, garlic sauce, hummus...all the important stuff, plus friendly service. 

5 star, I wish I could give more."}
{"text":"I was planning on going to a different place across the street when I spotted Shawarma Plus.  I am so glad I got detoured because this place is great.  My husband and I both got the entrees special and everything we had was fantastic.  We had Baked Rosemary Chicken, Meatballs, Potatoes, Beef Kebab, Veggies, Salad and Rice.  It's pretty healthy too which I appreciate.  We will definitely be making this a regular go to."}
{"text":"Love this place! The portions are generous but it's not so much food that you feel gross afterwards. You can tell all the vegetables are fresh especially in the tabouli.. The tabouli is my favorite and its satisfying but still light..  If you are looking for authentic Lebanese food in Henderson/7 Hills area I suggest Shawarma Plus forsure."}
{"text":"I was visiting Las Vegas when I was recommended by customers at Smashburger to go to a Mediterranean Restaurant.  Naji, the owner really knows how to welcome his customers.  The burger happens to be part lamb and ground beef.  Finally, a well flavored burger.  I definitely crave this burger again.  The fries were good too, but not as good as the ones I had today at Mario's Tacos in Pico Rivera.  I took home cabbage rolls and salad."}
{"text":"Been eyeing this spot ever since I exited the freeway (215 and Decatur). Well today was the day to give it a try. Nice large place, plenty of seating both table and bar seating. Good menu with plenty of options to customize your order. Daily specials also available for $9.99 which comes  with two entree items, rice and salad. I wasn't that hungry today so ordered the chicken shawarma. Wrap was nice and toasted and plenty of meat. I had to order a little more sauce but after that was pretty good 4/5. Next visit I will try the lunch specials. The baklava also looked delicious!

If you are military, veteran or police you get a free regular drink. Nice that they recognize us and appreciate our sacrifice."}
{"text":"This place is positively amazing. My husband and I ordered a large amount of food here last night just to be able to try a little bit of everything, it was so good that I ended up calling them after eating just to share how amazing I thought the food was. Everything was so flavorful and fresh. 10/10, will definitely be eating here more often and will absolutely be recommending to friends.    

Try the baklava. It's to die for!"}
{"text":"Used to be amazing. I got screamed at today for expecting cucumbers in my gyro. The menu says there are cucumbers on the gyros. How ridiculous of me to expect them.

\"Gyro pkease, only sauce, tomatoes and cucumbers.\"
\"It's extra for cucumbers.\"
\"But it says right there cucumbers are standard.\"
\"I DON'T KNOW WHY IT SAYS THAT. CUCUMBERS. ARE. EXTRA!\"

...

Allrighty then.

My arms are also superglued to the sticky, nasty table top.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed in the restaurant. Not only it way too expensive for what i got i also got food poisoning. They use too much garlic which i usually dont mind but they over did it. Plus it wasn't even real shawarma. It was cooked on stove top. Will never go back or recomend to anyone to go."}
{"text":"Right down the street from work. Ordered for pickup on Easter. The lamb was to die for!! Also tried the meat & cheese pies, REALLY good. Got the regular baklava, it was ok. They had different kinds, want to try the date one. But I did not like the rose tea, was like drinking perfume.... But I will be back! Lol"}
{"text":"Real good fresh food. It seems they make everything fresh. For $9.99 you get a lot of food. I will definitely be coming back in the near future to try other items on the menu. If you decide to visit make sure you try the garlic sauce. It is real good..."}
{"text":"This place was an unexpected surprise. The portions were huge, the food was delicious (the lamb and beef schwarma plate is a must), the staff was friendly - I was just wow-ed. I will definitely go back! And they deliver!"}
{"text":"I am a regular here usually once a week. The shawarma salad with chicken and hummus is what I usually order. I also have had our office cater for luncheons and the pizza's are good too."}
{"text":"First & last here I Will never Come back here took them 25 minutes to cook for Shish Kabob & I look at there prices $9.99 & owner charge ME $13 plus scam artist & he said thats only for Satur days & I say whatever Face money"}
{"text":"Very good place to eat...very nice man at counter...we had the beef & lamb shoarma plates...not sure what I liked better...yea it was all good...the counter man let me taste the tabuleleh...that was excellent...we're from San Antonio, Texas and there aren't many kinds of restaurants like this and this place was very good...the baklava was so good...next time I'm going to try the apricot and date baklava...thank you for a great restaurant...think we may try the shoarma pizza next time...Vicky from San Antonio, Texas"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite shawarma in town. The chicken kebab is juicy and perfectly cooked. Don't skip dessert! The homemade baklava is out of this world good. So save room on your main course!"}
{"text":"Not super familiar with middle eastern food. The outside is a little cheesy with all the pics of food plates plastered on their windows. The inside was clean which is more important than opinions on tastefulness. 

I ordered 

Stuffed grape leaves- good, moist and flavorful.  

Lebanese tabbouleh salad-really good combination of tomatoes, onions, garlic, mint and spices. 

Greek fries-fries with feta cheese and parsley. A one notch higher than regular fries. 

Beef & Lamb gyro-I've had better. A little dry and didn't like the panini-like presentation. 

Would I return...yes to explore other portions of their menu."}
{"text":"Great menu. I ordered the shawarma plate and it was so delicious. Great customer service, too."}
{"text":"Naji cooked up his family recipes and started a restaurant!  Our family has been to Israel and wanted to eat shwarma again.  Oh my gosh!  The lamb shwarma was fabulous!  Very authentic-I love food that gets its flavor from healthy, flavorful vegetables and roast meat.  The bread was thin, crispy and had a great toasted flavor.  I will go back again and again to try everything on the menu.  You should definitely try this place--good prices, too!"}
{"text":"We came here today on a lunch break.  Everything was perfect.

Being a pregnant woman, I am very conscious of what I eat.  Everything they had was fresh and satisfying.  I had a beef shawarma and some mixed veggies.  The meat was so tender and delicious.  The pita was fresh and fillings were flavorful.  My dining partner had a platter with rice, chicken, and veggies.  I've never seen anybody polish their plate off so quickly!   Of course we had to have baklava for dessert!!!  We loved it all!

The atmosphere is great.  I love all of the staff.  It's so nice to walk into a place and automatically feel like you are family.  Counters, tables, floors, and facilities were so clean.  They had a few arcade games that I'm sure my little one would love to fiddle with.  Oh, and most importantly- they have WI-FI!

We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped there for lunch today.... we tried the chicken kabobs , lamb shawarma plate and the meat pies... food was very good and fresh.  They give you tons of food for a very reasonable price... the shawarma plate was huge, I couldn't even finish it all.  Talked to the owner on the way out, very friendly and accommodating.    Some food items are served lukewarm or cold, but the owner said they would be more than happy to heat them to your preference.  We will definately be back and I would certainly recommend Shawarma Plus to anyone looking for a good Greek meal at a good price."}
{"text":"Very satisfying, great customer service! I ordered the kabob platter with extra skewer. All three were great - tender and juicy. I tried the chicken, beef, and lamb skewers. The salad and humus are both really good and fresh as well and come with the platters. My only ding is my wife ordered the shawarma chicken which was shaved from the spit and it was dry. However this place is well priced and the kabobs were excellent. The garlic sauce is also extremely good. Give this place a try"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a nice gentleman behind the counter.  It is very hard to find a good falafel out here. The one I ordered was right on mark. I loved the seasoned fries too. Nice, clean, relaxed atmosphere. I definately will go back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service.  They appear to have rotating specials and they have the traditional Mediterranean food as well. 

I got the chicken shawarma sandwich and the Greek fries.  Both really good.

My friend got the daily special and he loved it as well.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch. Gentleman behind the counter was super nice and very helpful. He told us about specials and even gave us a sample of the shawarma. We got the chicken kabob plate with salad, rice and hummus, the shawarma plate and a side of falafels. Both plates came with pita bread. The food was EXCELLENT! Portions very good. Really great flavor on everything and salad was very fresh. We had an unsweetened rose water iced tea which was very light and refreshing. They have a nice selection of desserts and things to take home, hummus etc. Prices were right. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food!  First time but it won't be the last.  Great gyro sandwich and the fries are better than McDonalds.  Also had the grape leaves and hummus and the spouse had talapia, rice and tabouli.  Great setup too, cafeteria style so it's ready immediately but the owner does all the serving so you don't have to worry about grungy hands.  Try it, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Their salad is probably one of the best salad I've had in a while!!! I can't even tell what type of vinaigrette they use but it's soooooo goood! Next time instead of extra rice I'm going to get extra salad :) I got the shawarma kabob plate w/ ground chicken!! So delicious. A must try!!!!  & btw the owner is super friendly and very nice.. go check this place out!!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving a 1 star so I can give a review. They were very rude to me!! I'm so offended. I ordered a chicken skewer  and a lamb skewer and the cashier charged me for combo plates, so our order came to over $40 when I only ordered 2 skewers and a small side salad. Then when I corrected her, she YELLED at me that I ordered incorrectly and how I need to order next time. Excuse me?! I'm never coming back here again. The cashier was angry with me because she had to call the owner to come fix it. Oh I'm sorry that you don't know how to void orders and that you're taking it out on me! I don't need to pay $40 for people to be rude to me and to Yell at me and to tell me how I should order!"}
{"text":"Well I couldn't leave ANOTHER amazing review for this place but as always the are the best Mediterranean food in Las Vegas! I would give them 20 stars if at all possible. Amazing food all around but the vegetarian and vegan is absolutely off the charts. The prices are extremely reasonable and the portion sizes are generous.  They also recently updated the look of the restaurant and it's very clean. Try the fresh cooked Falafels and bulgur wheat! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Food here is SO GOOD. Been here 2 days in a row with my coworkers and we all are in love. The gyro is amazing. Falafel snare great too not dry like most places. Looking forward to trying the chicken kabobs and the domathes soon! You can order your food ahead of time if you're worried about a time crunch as well. Will be back for sure! Yummmmmm."}
{"text":"Cute simple place to jump in for a tasty meal.
Nothing amazing, but food was good."}
{"text":"For food on the go it's amazingly affordable for such a healthy fresh meal. The owner is very nice, attentive and appreciative. 

The food speaks for itself with the favors and freshness."}
{"text":"Meat+Bread+Tzatziki Sauce= Mouth Magic. 

Multi styles of hummus, meat n' spinach pockets, and the insane customer service tactics. Hungry yet? 

This place popped up on the, \"new businesses\" page on Yelp and I realized this was right down the street from mi casa... shawarma time! When you walk-in you feel the friendly vibes pumping out of here as the staff welcomes you and ask how they can help with your order. This place offers, shawarma sandwiches, multiple salads, and  kabob plates. They make almost everything in house from the sauces, to the tabouli, and even roasting the meat on a traditional vertical roaster. 

I ordered the the shawarma wrap with lamb and all the fixins. Along with a greek salad, and stuffed grape leaves. The sandwich was amazing; fresh veggies, warm tender lamb, all brought together with a fresh made tzatziki sauce. The TZ sauce was so good that I want a IV hook-up, just so I can have it pumped directly into my veins every half hour. The bread was the perfect match for this feast. Thin and not too doughy, but strong enough to hold the amazingness that was inside. 

The stuffed grapes leaves were, just ok. To be honest, I've never really had a amazing grape leaves experience. I think it's a texture thing. Anyways, The salad was for my GF and she gave it a definite thumbs up. 

Would I go back for seconds? Yes. Which is why you should go for firsts or thirds."}
{"text":"Came here after reading reviews and we were thrilled with our lunch! Great service and the owner is incredibly kind. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food and a very friendly staff. I ordered the beef shawarma and a chicken shawarma wrap. They were both excellent and very fresh. I'll be going back soon"}
{"text":"Shawarma Chicken Pizza - very good;
Baklava - the best;
Greek Fries - awesome;
Grape Leaves Stuffed with Vegetable - they gave us rice stuffing instead and it was okay;
Hummus - ready made, bland, plain, nothing like the picture;
Pita Bread - cold;
Meat Pie with Beef - meh, nothing like the picture;
Ice Tea with Rose Water - weird"}
{"text":"The fries were delicious but that's about it. I had the gyro and it was completely bland. They use the thinnest pita bread and wrap it up like a burrito which is fine I guess but it pretty much was all meat. There was a drop of tazaziki sauce at the end of my \"burrito\" with light thinly cut pieces of lettuce, tomatoes and onion. It was so dry. I won't order from here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while we were having the oil changed on the motorcycle because it was within walking distance. My husband had the kebab platter with beef and lamb. Lamb was nicely spiced and the humus was creamy. I had the 2 entree lunch and choose the salad as its side. The entrees were the chicken moussaka and the eggplant with beef. Both were good but I really liked the flavoring of the eggplant with beef. The rose water iced tea was refreshing. Authentic food shows the preparers care about the food they make and serve. Reasonable price, good size portions, free refills on drinks and good service. We will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a wonderful place to go to get delicious Mediterranean cuisine. The food is always on point, especially their made fresh daily baba ganoush. The baklava is some of the best I've had. The employees are super friendly and actually appreciate the customers that walk in the door. I recommend this place to anyone that is in the mood for delicious food."}
{"text":"Never order through uber eats. I'm guessing the food would be good if it was hot. You get a nice amount of food. It's not too bad cold but unfortunately I just couldn't enjoy it."}
{"text":"I've tried 3 other Mediterranean restaurants in Las Vegas and this place is hands down the BEST!! The meat is always tender and flavorful, and the Salads to-go are fresh and delicious. I craved the chicken and lamb gyros throughout my entire pregnancy and now my 1 year old baby enjoys it with me. And they deliver!!!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Vegetarian plate was delicious. Fresh food, generous portions, and cheap price! Best baba ganoush I've ever tried."}
{"text":"Owner is super friendly the portions are very generous I was full off just the soup but had to eat more because my veggie plate look so good. Food was delicious and fresh,  we will be back"}
{"text":"On a vacation in vegas.  Of course I have to use yelp to help me decide on where to eat.  I chose this place today because of the 4.5 stars and the fact that I love schwarmas.  After reading all the mix reviews I placed my order to be delivered.   Once again eat24 failed me and I had to call in my order.  I ordered a chicken schwarma, a kabob plate with steak and chicken, a beef gyro and a side of falafel.  My order was taken quickly and was told to meet at the hotel lobby in 15-20 minutes for pickup. They didn't deliver till 35 minutes later but that was no biggie. 
We immediately opened our bag and in it were 3 wraps and 1 Styrofoam container.  Note:  they messed up on my side order of falafel and gave me a falafel wrap.  No problem.  Ate it anyways.  It was good, but nothing wow.  The falafel wasn't crunchy like I'm used to.  Maybe because it got soften from being in a wrap.  I liked how they had a sticker to label each wrap.  We unwrapped all three wrap and noticed they all looked identical.  I expected my shwarma to be wrapped up in a different type of wrap I'm used to, instead of the pita wrap. It didn't look any different than the gyro, in fact it was exactly like the beef gyro.  So maybe they messed up and gave me a chicken gyro?? Although the sticker on the wrap said schwarma. My husband's gyro was ok.  He said the wrap was too hard, too crunchy. He was disappointed there wasn't a side of tzatziki sauce.
 My chicken \"schwarma\" was ok.  The meat was flavorful but kinda salty for my taste.  There was definitely garlic in it.  I have a favorite gyro place in my hometown, and their schwarmas are THE BEST.  The meats are marinaded and sliced off and then tossed and cooked before being placed in a warm wrap.   This one on the other hand had a different type of chicken meat.  It looked like just plain chicken with garlic seasoning.  And it was a bit dry. And all our wraps were falling apart as we ate because the wrap got soggy from the inside.  The kabob plate was decent.  Both beef and and chicken were tender.  Could use a bit more flavor though.  But i just dipped the meats into the very delicious hummus.  Their hummus is on point.  I would come again only for the hummus."}
{"text":"Craving gyros so I came here because of good ratings on Yelp. Friendly customer service when I first walked in. Wasn't busy when I came in around 530 on New Year's Day.

Ordered just a beef and lamb gyro with a soda. Gyro was good but not the best Ive ever had. I would love to come back and try there other menu items. They look really great."}
{"text":"One of the best chicken shawarmas I've had in America. If that's not reason enough to come here, he'll even put French fries in your shawarma upon request, Lebanese style. 

I took the owner up on his suggestion to try the rose water iced tea and very impressed. It was light and refreshing, a completely unique drink. 

To top everything off the baklava was delicious. A perfect balance between flaky crust and savory filling. A must try. 

I'm making Shawarma Plus a destination I go to every time I'm in Vegas. I can't wait to try the rest of what's on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is the tits, they deliver crazy fast and hook up the plates. its consistently amazing i love this place for lazy days when i don't want to leave the house and the drivers are super cool."}
{"text":"We were in the area and were craving Mediterranean for lunch. Found this place on Yelp. We all chose to do the 2 entrees + salad or rice for $8.99.  I had fresh vegetables and Patka. The server built the salad with my choices from a variety of toppings. All selections are laid out buffet style for you to see.  You can also choose small containers of tabouleh, hummus, and grape leaves. We enjoyed the tabouleh and grape leaves. 

The flavors were incredible, the portions are generous, the staff is friendly, and the restaurant is clean. I hope to be back in this area again, soon, so I can come back!

The flavors were fantastic and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Have time for lunch.  Food is good. They just need a better system, of taking and delivering orders."}
{"text":"Just got an order to go.

Got home and I am so pleasantly surprised.  Huge order, my wife got the chicken shawarma plate and I got the gyro bowl.

So good, lots of food and for $20.  The food is fresh, really good and I will eat the rest tomorrow as they really gave me a lot."}
{"text":"A very great home cook style mediterrenian food.  Fresh and tasty.  I like their mousaka and eggplant entry. Salads are fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. Absolutely love the chicken kabob plate. Salad, hummus, pita, rice, grilled tomato and jalapeño. A quick meal you can feel good about eating. Can't go wrong here. The service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I would come to this place on my lunch break and the owner is always so nice and friendly. And the gyros are pretty delicious! 

Definitely a good place to come for a delicious quick meal."}
{"text":"Friendly service. My chicken shawarma had the tastiest garlic sauce -- it's sooo garlicky but sooooo good and sooooooo stanky on the breath. 

They have a baklava without walnuts which comes with custard and pistachio sprinkling.... very yummy.

A great place, and will take my extended family to it when they come visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! We had the shish kebab and the swawarma plate and everything was very delicious. We'll surely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I was craving Mediterranean food badly one day and noticed this place just opened, so I popped it to see what they have. The decor is really cool (they even have an old pacman table) and lots of open seating. Most of the food is laid out in several salad bar-style counters so you can inspect the food and dishes. They also have little boxes of hummus, sauces and baklava for sale.

Now, this review is just for the shawarma sandwich that I got - it came in a very thin tortilla wrap. I wasn't a fan of it, nor did I like the meager amount of meat and veg that was in it. Compared to other places in town for the same prices, this place doesn't give you as much for the same buck. I'll probably drive a bit further to my usual places to satisfy my shawarma urges.

Note: Their baklava is supposed to be really good."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean place in Vegas. Great for vegetarians and anyone looking for good food!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of Zankou chicken in Hollywood, which was one of my go-to's when I didn't want to cook. 

The garlic sauce that comes with the shawarma is YUMMMY- always ask for extra because I eat it with every bite. I order via yelp delivery, so I've never dined-in since I can eat from the comfort of my own home. If you like Armenian, Lebonese, or Mediterranean, this is a MUST try. Food is fresh and they serve nice portions."}
{"text":"It was a day like any other. I woke up, stretched out and thought to myself, \"will I ever find a place that can truly make the best shawarma?\" And so I began my quest. I spent countless nights and long hours searching and searching for something, anything, that would satisfy this craving, this itch for a worthy shawarma. However, after a time, it seemed as though this would be a fruitless endeavor. Was there such a thing as good shawarma? Was it even possible? Perhaps I had spent all this time in vain. Distraught and defeated, I carried what was left of me to one last search. It was on this day that I came across the Shawarma Plus. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap. At first it began like any other dining experience, but quickly a new, unfamiliar feeling began to take over my senses. It happened so fast yet hazily slow at the same time, coming to a euphoric standstill as a wave of what I can only describe as pure joy overtook my body. Yes. At last. Serendipity; pure bliss. Here I was at the end of my journey. I have found it, the one worthy of praise. It's name is Shawarma Plus."}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves 5 stars. I've had my fair share of shawarma and gyros and this place is up there. 

Walked in here for my first time and was pleasantly surprised to see 3 old school arcade game machines as well as a full display case of different baklava they offer. They also have a \"grab n go\" cooler display case with an assortment of easy to grab pre-made food. Totally cool. 

There were like 3 people in front of me and the lady behind the counter was doing her best as a couple of the people were asking all sorts of questions and taking FOREVER. She was knowledgable and patient though. It was almost my turn but then a lady came up to the counter asking for Togo boxes and started complaining that the chicken was dry. The lady behind the counter apologized and told the cook in back who informed her that the chicken was fresh. The customer lady continued to waste everyone's time by stating that her husbands chicken was dry too. Come on. You obviously ate it though. Calm down. She basically yelled how dry it was and stormed off. So needless to say by the time I got up to the counter I could tell the girl was over it lol don't blame her what so ever. 

I ordered the gyro beef/lamb sandwich combo and asked to sub a salad instead of fries and was told I could do so without an up charge. Yes! Food was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised to find pickles in my gyro. I LOVE pickles and the gyro place I normally go to doesn't add pickles to their sandwiches so this totally won me over. The salad was excellent and the dressing was delicious. The sweet tea tastes like horchata in a weird way but it's good and I keep drinking it so no complaints there. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Food quality bad. Honestly, I can youtube a Recipe and do more than this place. No flavor at all.

I was hungry and I accept is my fault for trying to follow reviews."}
{"text":"I was fooled by the review. salad was not fresh. veggies were wilted. the pita were not warm , the shawarma is substandard . I'll go back to Jerusalem grill. has the best chicken shawarma"}
{"text":"The food is soooo good! And the owner and staff are so friendly and always provide the most amazing customer service. The best kabobs and hummus I've ever had.. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place came recommend by a friend who is a local. Food is fantastic! We all had something different and we all were very happy! The vegan included. Rose water tea is not to be missed, unsweetened and sweetened both are refreshing. Lamb was tender, chicken seasoned with love, hummus is fresh and the roasted veggies were perfect.
Atmosphere is casual and quiet. It's easy to get to right off the freeway. So worth taking a break from the busy strip and slow down a bit for a good meal. We have already planned to eat here next visit, and it's been recommended to friends."}
{"text":"I ate some takeout here yesterday! Yummy 
 
I got two chicken kabob plates with an extra 2 skewers of steak & a soda. The guy who took my order was really nice. I sent my little bro inside to grab the food, sent him in with $40 thinking that would cover it, but it was $44 and some change... so the guy ended up taking the drink off to make it $40 and still gave him the drink. I just thought that was really really nice! Shout out to that guy lol 

And honestly I did think $40 was even a tad expensive for two combos with extra skewer.. but once I saw how much came in the bag I was like holy moly ok I get it! They give you enough for two meals. So basically I got 4 meals for $40 and it was all so fresh and so yummy. I did prefer the steak over the chicken, but both were flame  and the grilled pepper/tomato were my favorite things... omg yum  there were some stuffed leaf veggie roll things that I didn't order intentionally maybe it came with the combos but they were my least favorite component I honestly threw them away RIP

Eat here for good noms"}
{"text":"Amazing place! The good was delicious and the man working at the front was so helpful and courteous. They give you a good amount of food and they deliver, will definitely return multiple times !"}
{"text":"Terrible. We visited with friends from the Middle East; even spoke Arabic with the counter staff. We were so disappointed with the food and the service that it ruined the remainder of our day. Ketchup on the table was spoiled. When we mentioned this, no action was taken. Baklava was in a plastic box, was old, and stale. What an embarrassment! Stay away from here."}
{"text":"Super good. From out of town and was excited to try this place. I got the chicken shawarma and I loved the flavor of the chicken but what I really liked was the fresh vegetables and how they grilled the pita bread and it was crispy. Never had it that way here before and l loved it. I wish I had more time I would have loved to try more of what he served a lot of variety to pick from"}
{"text":"I found this place by shear proximity when I was hungry  for lunch and holy cow what a gem of a place. This is a no frills Mediterranean joint that makes some of the freshest, most authentic Mediterranean food around. It is so good I came back the next night for dinner. 

 Lunch I had the chicken Schawarma which was amazing. For dinner I tried the beef and lamb Schawarma and it didn't disappoint. The box the Schawarma plate comes in is beautiful. 

The Greek salad was fresh and delicious. The hummous was creamy goodness. 

Even the unsweetened ice tea is a treat. Has a unique flavor for tea but really good. 

If you're looking for really good food on a casual atmosphere, this is the place. Make the trip. Oh and save room for dessert, the baklava is awesome!"}
{"text":"I went here when I first opened and I told my coworker not to even bother it was not good. seeing all these great reviews, we tried again and it was a tad bit better but still who uses a Panini press for a gyro, and the fries were the worst I have had in decades. 3.99 chicken special but the guy told me I want the real one, the 3.99 was fried, the real wsa to be 6.99 I  felt scammed


The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the flavor was a little better the second time it's not the worst thing I've ever eaten but with four-five other Mediterranean place around this place, don't know how this place is going to compete. Despite being sold on paying full price of 699 for 399 sandwich the other employees seemed friendly and did seem like a mom-and-pop shop so I don't want to give them a one and 1 1/2 isn't an option"}
{"text":"I ordered the shawarma plate with beef and lamb (first dish on the menu). My experience was very mixed.

The pros are that the food for the most part is pretty tasty and the portions are generous for the price. The hummus was very good.

The negative is that the meat was way too fatty/greasy and I had a stomach ache like I haven't had since I was a small child. My stomach took 2 days to calm down. Maybe it was just me, but that was my experience and I would not try it again unfortunately."}
{"text":"My mom and I came in here craving shawarmas and we were not disappointed. My mom had the chicken shawarma and I had the beef and lamb gyro. Both were absolutely delicious. The lamb was coined perfectly, tender and tasty. The owner, Naji is very friendly and hospitable. Give this place a try, you will not regret it. Their baklava is amazing as well!

Updated:
Love this place! Verona the cashier made some awesome recommendations, I had the combo plate with some fish and zucchini with eggplant and ground beef. It was absolutely delicious and a very generous serving. My husband finished it off for me after having his kabob platter. We will definitely return again and again!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Lots of options, tons of combos if you like to try a little of a lot.  Always have the nicest service and will accommodate if picky.  Shawarma Plus is close to my office so always a good place to grab something quick and easy.  Try the fresh soups or the kabob plate, so good!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice little gem that I stumbled upon. I was with a work group and everyone else went to subway and I decided to do something different. I decided to get a chicken shawarma wrap. I have high standards for shawarma since I've had them all over the world. Most places I go the garlic sauce is watery and not very flavorful. This place had it all, the pickled beets, the nice rich garlic sauce that wrecks your breath for the rest of the day and the juicy chicken. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice quick lunch. The only thing I didn't like was the owner was a little pushy. Kept trying to get me to buy more when all I wanted was a wrap. Do you want sides, NO I just want the wrap, do you want a platter, NO I just want a wrap, do you want a drink, NO I just want a wrap. But that doesn't warrant a star loss."}
{"text":"Went there and I'm not impressed. I was just there for the hummus couse I used to get it at fresh and easy. Hummus pretty good order the vegetarian falafel plate for me and the chicken panini for my husband. The veg plate well I didn't finished it. It was too pickled or Vinegary EVERYTHING but the hummus is good so this is my place for that. My husband liked the panini so that was good. And owner was really nice. So I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"Great, delicious food! This was our first visit here and Naji, the owner, was very helpful in assisting us with choosing items. Had the lamb gyro wrap and it was superb! Nice, fresh ingredients! My mom had the gyro rice bowl. We will definitely be back for the yummy food and excellent service! :)"}
{"text":"Discovered this place last night. The food was excellent. Freshly made falafel that tasted amazing. I also had the Shawarma salad with lamb and it was great. The restaurant has a clean and inviting interior. This is my new go-to place for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for a quick lunch the other day. Shawarma House is a take-out style type of place with no fancy plates or silverware. That said, it actually has a pretty comfortable vibe to it. 

The prices are more than reasonable, most of them between $6 and $12. I got the Chicken Shawarma Plate for $12, and it included vegetables, rice/fries/salad, chicken, hummus, and bread. What a deal! 

My chicken tasted great. It was seasoned just right, didn't have too much sauce, and was still warm. The bread was thin, crispy, and oven fresh. I loved it. Overall, the food served here is much healthier than a lot of other to-go foods, and the portion sizes are great for lunch. I'm quite pleased. 

The dessert is not that great. When I bought the pre-made Baklava at the counter, I was expecting it to have more of a fluffy consistency like the Turkish Baklava I have had in Germany, but it turned out to be more of a brownie-cookie consistency, more crunchy and packed rather than fluffy and light. I'm not sure if that was just a cultural difference between dishes, but one of the pieces was so hard that I had issues stabbing it with my fork. Not a fan.
 
I would recommend this place for healthy and affordable food-to-go or a casual lunch, but I probably wouldn't get Baklava again."}
{"text":"I visited this place again and it was like a different restaurant. It was pretty terrible and almost as if they didn't know how to cook food but we're trying. Such a strange turn around from the first time I went. The falafel was still good though and that is why I give two stars. I will not be back."}
{"text":"The owner is soooo nice, I would like to give higher stars but the food was okay.  we had chicken shish kabob and it was good.  But the desserts we bought tasted stale, I think the nuts were bad and we paid a lot for boxes of it.  The rose water ice tea was unique.  The other dishes were premade and we wondered bout the freshness as they were sititng there a long time.  We both had stomach aches later, but it could have been from the dessert.  So not anxious to return because of that.  :("}
{"text":"What a treat I saw this place from the street (eastern) and I thought what the heck might as well get a falafel for lunch. It's was really good and I got a lot of food for the cost. The humus was super good. I will return!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place as I drive by it three times a week. The restaurant is very clean and inviting. They even have free wifi. I love Gyros, so I ordered the Gyro combo. The Gyro sandwich was excellent and the grilled pita was really good. The owner was a very pleasant man and brought me a cup of vegetable soup. I'm not a big fan of veg soup but this was good. Overall, I hope this place does well as I need a go to spot for my Gyro fix and this is now it."}
{"text":"Amazingly friendly staff, delicious home style food, and family oriented. Planning on coming here time and time again! First time trying moussaka and it's now one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it's halal because the first owner lied and said everything was halal but the new owner mentioned the previous owner really didn't have halal meat. New owner and still not guaranteed the meat is halal. No sign."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and loved it.  I ordered for a pickup and everything was ready for me by the time I got there. The owners were so very nice and kept adding some extras to my order for me to try for free:)! The food was great and I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Came across this place as we were driving through Vegas trying to find somewhere near the freeway to stop for dinner. I got one of the shawarma plates, which was incredibly tasty! The prices are great for the amount of food that you get!"}
{"text":"My husband and I always pass by this restaurant and have always wanted to try it out.  Now that we have,  we absolutely LOVE it!!!  We ordered the beef/lamb shish kebab plate and the chicken shawarma and some baklava for dessert.  Everything was so delicious,  we would DEFINITELY  be back for more.
Another plus was the owner was really nice and helpful with what to order.  He also gave us free samples of their soup.  He was SUPER nice. A++++"}
{"text":"Very bland chicken shawarma... Lebanese shawarma is usually piping hot and well marinated..  Very disappointed, since it looked so promising and clean. I will give it another chance just because it's across from my job site and I need to try the lamb to really tell if this place is just a water down Mediterranean place."}
{"text":"The place was clean and nice. The gyro meat was tasty, but the bread use like an burrito was a fail. Was so dry, I couldn't eat."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. The Mediterranean burger is one of my favorites and their lentil soup and I could go on haha."}
{"text":"This place was so good. The owner rang us up and he was very kind. He offered us advice on menu items and even let me sample their rose water ice tea. Which I will definitely return for. Our food came out fresh and was perfect. The falafel was really good, but the chicken shawarma was my favorite. The seasoning was so good.
The garlic sauce is amazing, but I'm a garlic lover. Will be back again!

Also tip:they have old arcade games, which will Def take you back to the good old days. The kids will love this"}
{"text":"This will be my third review today as I'm attempting to get caught up on recent travels.  As a result, I'm not feeling terribly verbose so this review will be brief.  

I have wanted to try Shawarma for quite some time and during a recent trip to LV I discovered Shawarma Plus right here on Yelp.  Suffice it to say, this place lives up to the rating.  First, Shawarma is fantastic and something tells me Shawarma Plus is a prime example.  My wife and I both had chicken and greatly enjoyed it.  The hummus was fantastic as well.  As for decor and service, both were quite welcoming."}
{"text":"Great Food! Hugh portions and tasty grinds! Really fast delivery and the quality is very good. Prices are fair and we would recommend anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"GREAT place!

I ordered over the phone and was told my food would be ready in about 20 min. Fast forward 20 min later and I walk into the restaurant to a bag filled with my food, hot and ready to go. HOLY CRAP, he actually kept to his word!

The owner was so friendly and thankful for the business. His appreciation, quality service, AND QUALITY DELICIOUS GOOD FOOD make me want to come back again when I find myself in LV next time.

Kudos!"}
{"text":"Not real Mediterranean food or even close. 

Ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich. 
Comes on a burrito tortilla not a pita. The chicken was not marinated and was just a breast grilled and tossed in with lettuce and tomato. 

On top of it all the garlic sauce was so overpowering it burnt my mouth. I love garlic.... I'm an Italian from Chicago... I eat food from every culture. But this was inedible. 

I can still taste the garlic...."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The beef kabob is the best and not to forget the baklava :) I was happy to have tried it."}
{"text":"In addition to the friendly service and impeccably clean seating, this Shawarma spot really knocked it out of the park when it comes to amazing grub! So, freakin' delicious and fresh! The garlic sauce predicted my breath for the remainder of the day but it was worth every piece of densely chewed gum. I had the chicken platter, the pita was the perfect blend of crisp and chewy and the chicken shawarma was out of this world!  The salad dressing was authentic and rose water tea was a perfect complement! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent shawarma plate. Meat is very tender and good quality. At first I thought this place was overpriced but once we received our plate it was a very good value considering the quality and very large portion sizes. I loved the hummus and the garlic sauce is super good."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend had lunch there on a Saturday.

This place has a nice selection on menu. We don't eat meat, so we had veggie plates, soup and baklava for desert. We were practically impressed with the babaganush and hummus was also good. Everything was very fresh and prepared with care, made perfectly to bring back good memories and satisfy expectations.

The owner, Naji, was very attentive and excessively kind, something that makes you want to visit again. 

It was our first time there and we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Very good. A little pricy at $17 for my meal - I got a Greek salad- with no protein an side dish of tabouli and dolomas... Great homemade rose water sweet tea! Very refreshing. I will be coming back. Everything seems to be made in house!"}
{"text":"This place is super yummy! I highly recommend it. I LOVE the garlic sauce that comes with the chicken. We've only been here a few times, but will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma plate was great! I like a lot of sauce so I will ask for extra next time, but the food was great! Boyfriend got the lamb kabob it was good he said I didn't get to try it. I will definitely come back the prices and portions are very reasonable. Also I didn't feel like the food took a long time at all however the place was empty."}
{"text":"Decent lamb gyro. Strong salad and hummus. Clean spot open and bright. Only thing I didn't really care for was the iced tea"}
{"text":"I just love this Mediterranean place. Food is absolutely delicious! Jut had shawarma with Greek salad and it was amazing! Can't wait to come back here next week :)"}
{"text":"This place has awesome shawarma.. We tried the Beef and Lamb Shawarma wrap with a side of salad.. Everything tasted fresh! The baklava was heavenly! We will definitely be coming back.. 

We also love that this place is open really early.. :)"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try, don't waste your time.   Schwarma chicken pieces were so dry I couldn't even chew them.  Pita bread was dry.  Iced tea had a funky smell to it. Only good thing I can say was the French fries were decent, only thing we could eat for 13.00 a piece."}
{"text":"Food was good. Staff was friendly. Wasn't sure what Shwarma was when I walked in but I found out it's kind of like a Gyro with slightly different toppings. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. The Shawarmas are very authentic. My daughter had the meatball and potatoes. I could've eaten her whole plate. We will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the Bomb!  Naji the owner is extremely friendly as well as very accommodating when it comes to the menu choice. They always have six brand-new items that are daily fresh food.  They also have a wonderful salad bar that they serve to you. They have an many options for sweets including baklava. The restaurant is very clean and has a nice atmosphere with video games and television. They have very nice ceiling fan as well as nice pictures of the food and an electronic menu. 

I would recommend this restaurant and give it five stars for the authentic fresh healthy choice food! Make sure and give it a try!"}
{"text":"I really REALLY wanted to like the food here. The owner is very nice & the place looks nice & is clean, but the food is TERRIBLE.

I'm well versed in REAL Middle Eastern food, plus I'm a foodie. I believe that the guy I saw who came out of the kitchen to put something on a plate is the cook & he is LATINO!

People, you NEVER trust a different ethnic background to cook the ethnic food you are eating. That's cooking 101. Not unless he's a to die for real chef.

I haven't tried the lentil soup yet, so maybe it will be good, but I doubt it. 

Here is what I did try:

1. Grape leaves - while the vegetable one was better than the rice one, it's not traditional. I've never had a vegetable one in my life & I've been eating grape leaves since the 80's. Even the can one I buy at Trader Joe's (called Dolmades for the Greeks) is better . 

I bought 4 rice & 1 veggie. They were bland & I ended up giving it to my friend, so there was $4 down the drain.

2. The $9.99 plate consisted of moussaka & the eggplant with beef, which if I had to choose the best dish, that was it, but it was over cooked, dry & very little flavor. 

The moussaka (get this) was made with CHICKEN & had pasta in it. WTH??? It was also bland.

The best moussaka I have found in all my years is at a place across from the University. Shocked me too. Expensive, but very good.

The side dish of gluten or whatever that was, was also bland. I ate most of these dishes only because I was starving & on the road, but then I felt sick afterward because I always feel sick after I eat food that isn't good.

3. The tabbouleh was disgusting. It didn't even look green, NO TASTE, no lemon, no salt, nothing. It also looked like it had been sitting there wilting for hours.

I'm a HUGE Tabbouleh lover when it's prepared properly. This isn't an easy dish to prepare, but even the box mix of Tabbouleh I used to buy was better than this.

When a Middle Eastern place is selling chicken nuggets & burgers, that's warning enough they don't know what they are doing. I of course didn't know this until I got there. 

Even the pickled turnips weren't good enough for me to eat.

Why people give this place 4-5 stars is beyond me, other than to say they've never had REAL Middle Eastern Lebanese food or their sense of quality is very low.

I mean no disrespect to the REAL reviewers here (everyone knows that most reviews are fake). If you love this food, go for it, for people like me who know what good food is, you will have expectations.

I'm not trying to be a snob, but nothing irks me more than when I waste my hard earned money on food that is so bad I have to throw or give most of it away."}
{"text":"We were driving by and saw this place. We love middle eastern food so we had to stop by. The man at the counter rang us up, he appeared to Be the owner. He was very nice and suggested the chicken shawarma.

When we got our food, we were glad we listened. Portions are good and definitely worth it. The food was super fresh. We will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Chicken shish kabob plate is delish! The chicken was really flavorful and cooked just right. Came with a nice salad, yellow rice, hummus, garlic sauce stuff, a grilled tomato and chili pepper (which I havent seen before at this type of restaurant. nice surprise since i love them!) and pita bread. (Warning: if you eat the garlic sauce you will have some killer breath. It really adds a nice flavor to the meal so its worth it but man i wished i had a toothbrush with me at the office!) The owner was very nice, the restaurant is clean and has some cool old school arcade games. Iced tea is so good!  I want to try the baklava but im on a diet so i guess thatll have to wait until cheat day."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious here! I got the shawarma sandwich for lunch and I was surprised by how good it was... I was starving when I got here so I was super impressed with the quality of my sandwich (which by the way was very filling). Walking in you can tell the place was very clean and the atmosphere was a nice place to have lunch with a couple of my friends. Service is excellent. I've been to plenty of middle eastern/ Greek restaurants and shawarma plus is definitely at the top of my list!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! And excellent service from Verona at the counter. I live near Nellis Air Force Base and I travel all the way here for great healthy food! I highly recommend them to all!!! I also recommend the kefta and ground chicken. Yummmmmy!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"I had the meat pies , they were great , tasted just like the ones I make. Also my boyfriend got the stuffed zucchini , the only place in Vegas that makes it , he loved it ! I recommend this place !"}
{"text":"I just ordered delivery and it didn't look anything like the other pictures. My falafels were dry, flat discs that were disappointingly gritty. The hummus and tzatziki sauce were far more sour than I'm used too. And while I've never eaten the grapeleaf-wrapped rice logs before, they tasted rather strange. I also tried the lamb-gyro sandwich. It was not anything like the gyro sandwiches you can typically get from a Greek restaurant. They were served wrap-style with a tortilla-like pita bread outside. Lastly, their Rose Water Iced Tea just taste like poorly flavored water. 
All in all, this place was a miss."}
{"text":"So glad we found a new shawarma place close to home. The meat was well seasoned and fresh, the hummus was amazing, and the service was great. Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Food tastes so good the service  the staff smiles all the time  .......... get in and will never regret"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this incredible establishment.  I live down the road and stopped in one night when I didnt have enough time to cook. The chicken schawarma plate was fresh. .well seasoned and well balanced. I came in today and met the owner....he was incredibly personable and reviewed all my options with me. I went for the gyro w fries and some baklava.  Aside from my wife's version...probably one of the best in town. The gyro was good, a few too many outer pieces but nicely seasoned and doused in a great sauce. The fries as always were great, the seasoning on the outside really jazz them up, I just forgot to orelder the awesome garlic sauce I used when I had the plate....next time"}
{"text":"I work right up the street from Shawarma Plus, and was very excited to have a new lunch option when they opened. I have been in three times now for lunch, and I don't think I will be returning as I find the pricing too high for the flavor and quality of the food. The employees (owners?) constantly try to upsell as well, which is off putting.

On my first visit I got a combo platter for $8.99 as well as a side of tabouli salad for $3.99. The food was pretty good, especially the chicken with rice, which I found myself craving it a few weeks later...  Sadly, on my next visit the chicken was rather dry and the rice was very bland.

On my most recent visit I had chicken skewers, which came with salad, rice and hummus. It was the special for the day, at $9.99. The chicken was not overcooked but the seasoning left much to be desired (I probably should have requested some garlic sauce for it). The hummus and tabouli were both just ok, I have had much better elsewhere. And the pita bread was a disappointment, there is no way was in made fresh in house. 

The iced tea made with rose water is delicious. If I do return, it will be for that. I would rather drive a little further and get Mediterranean cuisine  that is more to my liking than settle for subpar food."}
{"text":"My food was decent - not the best by any stretch - but reasonably good. Staff here is friendly and the location is good because it is just off the freeway. BUT I can't get over the use of FOAM plates for dining in.

This is very tacky and a deal breaker for me. Foam is disgusting and when I eat my food out of foam I have to be extremely careful not to get foam particles in my food.

Do we really need more chemicals going in our body?

You people who are giving this place 5 stars are VERY IGNORANT if you think it is ok to eat food out of cheap foam containers. YUCK."}
{"text":"The service in this restaurant is nothing short of 5 stars! When you walk in, they treat you like you our family who has just come home and they are so happy to see you. The food is genuinely outstanding! Everything is fresh and homemade. The menu very slightly each time you go and because it is all freshly made. Definitely give this one a shot, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a really good Mediterranean place and we found it.  The owner who was super nice let us in even though they were closing and gave us such care in serving us. The gyro meat was so juicy and tender (most of the time it's dry at other places), hummus was great, and the tzaziki and garlic sauce was awesome.   We will be coming back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"I like their food and cleanliness! If you are thinking about going somewhat healthy, this is the food to go with! The service is nice as well. Since all the food are pre made, you can order them just by looking at them to your liking!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! GREAT SERVICE!

I am a fan of mediterranean food and this one did not disappoint. I personally love the shawarma wrap, garlic sauce, tabouleh & falafel

The owner was very nice & welcoming.

Coming back here for the shish kabob. :)"}
{"text":"Very good! It's a little out of the way but it's worth it. Paid about 9$ for a combo which included a huge lamb gyro, large soft drink, and a side of fries / salad!"}
{"text":"Ordered thru Door Dash... food seemed like it came from a \"grocery store\" and very poor quality. The portion was big and only thing that was decent was chicken... pita was frozen and tzaziki  sauce was not good. Hopefully quality gets better and try again."}
{"text":"Love going in here for lunch. Food is always hot and tastes great. Good quantity for the price although it seems depending on who's cooking you may get a slightly different compilation of sides with plates. The grilled pepper is a perfect touch to top off a meal though. Employees are always super nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The chicken shawarma is the best.  I've been here a few times and I am always happy with my food. Naji, the manager,  gives the best service and he's so nice. Eat here!"}
{"text":"5-stars! Not sure why some people can't understand good tasty food? I went in tonight even though there were a few not so good reviews. I'm glad I did! Service was great! And the food great! I ordered a chicken kabob and beef kabob combo. It came with rice, side of salad, and some damn good hummus! Very filling! And I'm not a small guy! I WILL definitely re-visit this place! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic  Mediterranean  food 
Yummy 
My kids love the shawarma so testy and delicious"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!! Service was amazing! Had a young lady greet us as soon as we walked through the doors with a warm and friendly smile. She also helped us a great deal with finding something delicious on the menu. I was glad to see how clean the establishment was. Ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich with a side of tabuleh and it was incredible! The chicken was moist and perfectly cooked and the garlic sauce complimented it very well. The tabuleh was also to die for! Its like sitting at your mothers house and having a deliciously prepared, home-cooked meal! 

Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on my Eat24 app while looking for places to have lunch near my work. I was so happy to find this place because they have the best chicken shawarma and fattouch salads. The pricing is good and the staff is really nice, will definitely return in the future. You have to be careful to pass them by because they a little hard to notice."}
{"text":"Finally had lunch here after driving by a million times. I will definitely back. The gyro meat is phenomenal. The babaghanoush (however you spell it) is among the best I have ever stuffed in my face hole. Only kind of weird thing for a first timer is if you want a salad --- cause you just want to be fat, not obese --- you actually have to take the packaged salad out of the little cooler thing. It confused me.

And then I missed out on adding some olives and pickled beets to the array. I will know better next time!!!"}
{"text":"$3.99 for a yummy, super stuffed chicken gyro (make sure you order the \"special\" and not the chicken gyro off the menu-that was $6.99). I don't think I need to write any more to convince you to eat here. 

We ordered the chicken special and the panini sandwich to go- everything made fresh and we were still in and out in 10 minutes. Garlic sauce, garlic sauce, garlic sauce. If you're not a fan of garlic sauce you should probably crawl into a cave and never come out, because you don't know good food. Or I guess order something without garlic sauce. Warning: The garlic sauce is strong! (but of course, amazing)

There was a pickle in my gyro... Is that normal? I'm not complaining, it was good! I'll be back for more Shawarma."}
{"text":"AMAZING food, GREAT service, and HOT Arab guy that takes your order = INCREDIBLE dining experience!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise! The schwarma was as good as the best I had in Hong Kong, the fries yummy, the sweet iced tea is to die for, I bought another meal to take home for tomorrow (: everything fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"After seeing some of the reviews I must say that I am surprised.  I just finished my meal from this place and although it wasn't bad, it also wasn't right. 
Let's first start off with the most important thing.... the name of the place is SHAWERMA plus.  As you know, there are many types of shawerma. I ordered the BEEF shawerma. The girl informed me that it is a combo beef/lamb. If you are familiar with middle eastern or Mediterranean food, then you know beef/lamb meat is actually a GYRO, not shawerma! I wanted to give it a chance so I ordered it. And, of course the meat in my sandwich was gyro meat. Don't get me wrong, if you want gyro meat, then it was really good. I, on the other hand, was looking for an actual shawerma sandwich. 
My family member also ordered shawerma, but with chicken. Her sandwich was good, but was with garlic sauce. A correctly made shawerma sandwich is with tahini sauce. So although both sandwiches were good and full, they weren't what we were looking for. Being of middle eastern descent, I know what shawerma is. 
It's funny to me that the place is called shawerma plus, but they don't make a correct shawerma sandwich. 
We also ordered a side of hummus. The girl asked if we wanted pita bread with it. Of course we want pita bread, how else were we gonna eat the hummus?! And, I was charged for the pita bread. If I had asked for extra bread, then of course I should be charged, but to be charged for the regular order is ridiculous!!!!
I won't even mention how expensive this place is!!! 
I'm sorry to say that although the food tasted ok, it sucks that this is what they are serving people. If your menu states beef, then it should be beef. And if you call yourself an authentic shawerma place, then make actual shawerma!!"}
{"text":"Their chicken shawarma wraps are so good! I've been meaning to try other things but the wraps are so good that it is hard to order anything else. I believe it is a mom and pop restaurant and the owners/staff give great service. They really try to be friendly and make you feel at home. I will be back to try more from their menu."}
{"text":"This is unbelievable food and the service is wonderful!!!
Definitely try this place out!!"}
{"text":"Got Chicken Sharma rice bowl and flafa. Good food plenty for two meals. A little on the high end of prices though."}
{"text":"Great selection of flavorful Mediterranean dishes. The 2 choice plate was a gr8 deal for $8.99. Good way to try all the different dishes. Big dining area, rose iced tea/good soft drink selection. Quick service. Large bathroom."}
{"text":"I have ate here a handful of times, I like there hummus, it is bit pricey for salads.  There are few items I would like to try that look good ."}
{"text":"I've ordered twice from Shawarma Plus through UberEats at work and it has been a great choice each time. I'm the envy of the break room with these delicious eats.

The first time I ordered the Shish Kabob plate and the second time I did a combination of Chicken & Kefta plate. Both times the food was great. All of the meats I've tried were moist and tender. I love the delicious rice that is served with a grilled tomato and a grilled pepper on top. The hummus is delicious and creamy. The pita bread has been nice and soft both times. The small salad that comes in the plate has a nice tasting dressing and I won't complain about more veggies! Not necessary since the meats are already great, but they provide a garlic sauce that is delicious for dipping the meats. 

The portions have been great and were enough to make two modest portions for me. You can't beat two lunches in one! Even with an upcharge for kefta the plates have come in at less than $15 which seems reasonable for the quality and quantity of food provided."}
{"text":"This is the best Med restaurant I've been too in Vegas. We were super hungry in a road trip so ordered just about everything on the menu.  Everything we had always super fresh, great portions and super tasty!  The owner helped us and was very friendly.  They also have incredible deserts that we took to go for our road trip.. Lots of different kinds of baklava.  Will be back here every time I come back to Vegas! 3-5 mins from the south strip.."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for shawarma. They also have various middle eastern and medditeranean food. Food is always fresh and the customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"The food did not taste good in my mouth. The sauce tasted...gross. The lettuce? WILTED. Scary bathroom situation. Not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"The lamb gyro was so yummy that my daughter was begging me for more bites of my food, even though she loved her falafel. The falafel was so light and crispy on the outside, and I've had good falafel in LA. This was much better than I've had even at my favorite place Royal Chicken in Burbank. The rose water iced tea is everything just like everyone has said it was, so good!!! We will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"WOOOOOOOOOW .......... HANDS DOWN, TO THE ANGRIEST, MOST RUDEST, MOST DISRESPECTFUL HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET WHO RUNS THIS ESTABLISHMENT. 

My husband and I placed an order for delivery, it added up to nearly $70 (delivery was an additional 12 or so) (money is not the issue)   - the chicken was completely dried out and the lamb wraps tasted terrible, the wrap itself was also stale and the garlic sauce was indescribably strong.  

My husband called back to complain as we felt the quality of food should not warrant a price tag like this. It was the worst delivered quality food and we weren't happy, everything about it was BAD. It was the principle. 

Anyway, I am posting this not only because of the quality of food but because the manager went absolutely insane when we called in to complained, he told my husband (in the most aggressive, threatening and disgusting tone) that he was F***** CHEAP, that he SHOULD NEVER CALL again, then he accused him of being  a LIAR and that he was STUPID for ordering SO much as we knew the price. He then hung up on him without any resolution!!! 

Its too bad because we just moved into a new neighborhood and we order for delivery quite often.  (I'd like to believe we help contribute to our local restaurant owners)

Words cannot describe just how horrible this man was, pure aggression, and I cannot imagine having to deal with this level of customer service face to face. The thought of this man holding a sharp objects while simultaneously dealing with a dissatisfied customer sends shivers down my spine. 

All I can say is, \"Don't take my word for it!\" and when it happens to you, you will know how badly we were treated! 

Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend and it wasn't bad at all for a first timer for coming to this location plus even trying this type of food.

Service was good. Pretty much self serve. You order at the front then food is served to you when ready.(you do have to get your own utensils near the drink fountain). Very spacious place, clean, and quite busy depending on. 

So what was ordered is the gyro with beef and lamb, gyro with chicken, cabbage stuffed rice, and  baklava. The beef and lamb were really good(would recommend for anyone)  as for the chicken it was okay. I do think it was how the chicken was made. Then again I can't really compare it to anything since it is my first time trying it out. I have tried the grape leaves stuffed with rice from a coworker, thinking that it will be the same as the cabbage stuffed rice. Nope, not at all. I can't say that I hate it but I also didn't like it either. Haha finally onto dessert. I liked it a lot. The only thing that got to me was the syrup that was added on top. It was sweet but the scent and taste of rose petal just threw me off guard. I'm not saying that it was bad, it just confused my taste buds for a bit.

I give this place an overall rating of 4/5stars just cuz it was my first time. Will be coming back to try out their other food items. ^_^"}
{"text":"Sticky tables, tea is nasty, ordered a chix shawarma, The chicken was poor quality, fries hard as a rock (way overcooked), about the only thing acceptable on my plate was the salad. Pita was thin so the gyro (my friend's lunch) was more like a burrito. Won't be back."}
{"text":"We ordered a large gyro pizza online through their link on yelp. When I went to pick up the pizza the person at the front desk scolded me pretty harshly for using the internet to order instead of calling in my order. 

If you don't want customers to order online, I suggest you don't make it an option! 

We liked the pizza but I did not like getting yelled at for ordering online so I will not be a return customer."}
{"text":"Awesome food! best Mediterranean food in town! you have to try the chicken kabob big portion also the humus is yummy! definitely going back here and try something else!"}
{"text":"Having sailed to the Mediterranean, I can somewhat vouch for the quasi-authentic food they serve here at Shawarma Plus. I come here on occasion and it's been fairly consistent. They do have Shawarma, and they do have plus. Lot's of plus. 

The owner, a Lebanese salesman ripped right out of a jewelry store in Beirut, works the register on occasion. He pushes the kabob platter like it's going out of business, and will sell you a combo meal on anything you order by default. (be sure to speak up before hand if you prefer a' la carte)....but for real, this guy is slick. Be on your A-game when you walk in, or else you'll wake up in the next day in a shopping cart full of baklava. 

Also, rose water tastes like the smell of foot powder masked by an old woman's perfume... However, the rose water iced-tea here I really enjoy. I actually get it every time I go, whether I want it or not.

The interior of the establishment has a partial arcade circa 1992,  a point of purchase counter filled with baked goods for up sell, and some newly added self-serve margarita machines. Steven Wright works the spit AND be sure to enjoy the self-serve vanilla ice cream. Always a hit."}
{"text":"This place just opened a few days ago. Hands down best shawarma in town. They also have daily specials. Check these guys out!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! I've never tried Mediterranean food really but the food here is amazing. The owner is very friendly and atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef schwarma and was happy with my choice. The beer was extremely tender and flavorful and the pita wrap was soft and warm all in all it was very good! Also It was recommended that I get the house made rose water iced tea it was very good although it was warm so it melted all the ice in my cup and watered down and diluted the mellow flavor of the tea."}
{"text":"Loved the staff...very friendly. Reasonable meal prices. Nice salad bar.  Their hot food buffet was under-heated. Meat should be kept at a certain temperature. Unfortunately the meals were not heated in proper steam table pans, they only had a light bulb over each pan. Not nearly hot enough to avoid food spoilage. It was a clean place with good service but I would be hesitant to go back because of the food temperature."}
{"text":"So far not impressed with this place. A little pricey. Not as cheap as people say. Maybe it's what I got. Chicken wrap. I'll try again when I am in the area. It is a mission to get to during lunch traveling south on Decatur."}
{"text":"My wife and I both ordered the 2 entree special. Between the 2 of us we shared Moussaka with lamb, spinach with chicken, rice and lentils with fried onions and cabbage rolls with beef. Everything was fresh and tasted homemade. Very large portions and he even through in free dessert (baklava). We will be back and recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"I had to bump this place up to five stars. It is that good. Excellent Lebanese cuisine. They have shawarma, kabobs, daily specials, pastries, and more. I am so glad I found this place on Yelp. This place reminds me of being back home in Dearborn, MI. They also make the garlic sauce the proper way here too. If you like Middle Eastern cuisine, then you will love this place. Stop in and try it!! The best Lebanese food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best choice ever ! This is authentic Mediterranean food, I ordered the chicken shawarma half and half with gyro meat and it was great, the serving was big, with salad,veggies and hummus, also with pita bread, its a great delicious combination platter. I will certainly come back for more !!!!"}
{"text":"So I normally wouldn't give a place a one star review, but I'm so grossed out. The food wasn't too bad, but they totally need to train their staff on health code standards. I asked the older gentleman behind the counter if I could have a to go cup for my leftover hummus. He asked for my plate of hummus, then he took the spoon out of the hummus on the serving line, spooned my half eaten serving of hummus into a container, then put the serving spoon back in the pot of hummus on the serving line. So basically the next people that order the hummus will have my mouth germs in their food! So gross! Not going back!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Mediterranean food we've had since we moved here. Their garlic sauce and hummus are INSANELY GOOD. I usually don't eat the salads but their dressing is good. The only thing I'll knock on and it's kind of me too is I wish their pita bread was softer, I have a hard time chewing it but my jaw isn't aligned properly so it hurt but I mean, I still ate it. I loved that the kabobs had grilled zucchini in between the chicken pieces cause most places their just all meat and I liked having a little veggie to break it up. We definitely will be back!! :3"}
{"text":"Up to expectations. The plate I ordered had meat that could have used more roasting, but flavor was good. Hummus was a little oily, but good. Nothing else really stood out, the tsiki sauce, pita, pickled veggies. The rice was pretty dry. It looked good and was plated nicely. Seemed to be pretty healthy but on the expensive side (for a plate). The rose iced tea was interesting. I don't think I'd crave anything that I had here."}
{"text":"This is my second time here this week. I guess the upside of working in Henderson is you get access to all these wonderful and yummy restaurants. This place just opened up a couple months ago, I think. Their shawarma is effin LEGIT. I shouldn't say that, because I don't really know how legit shawarma tastes like. Me coming back to the same place twice in a week says something though. I've been craving for their beef & lamb shawarma every day since I had it the first time. The portions are HUGE, but you just wanna keep eating because it's THAT GOOD. To top it all off, they have this rose water iced tea that is just.. so disgustingly amazing. I don't know how one can make iced tea taste that good. Must be the roses. Anyway, I'm going to close this by saying that every time I'm on this side of town, I'm paying this place a visit."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has so many good reviews. My experience was LESS then impressive! I got a kabob platter, specifically asked for NO salad & NO grilled vegetable garnish. When I got home I noticed that there was in fact grilled tomato & pepper in the dish. The chicken kabob also had zucchini between the pieces of chicken. The rice which was very yellow taste like nothing other then lemon, it was as though it was swimming in lemon, it was disgusting. After taking all is the zucchini of the chicken I attempted to eat it but it was rubbery when you bite into it. I was too scared to eat it after that. I did however eat some fries lol oh, I almost forgot my husband also bought an assortment of sweets, the baklava was HORRIBLE! Worst I've had. It was dry & the all I could taste was the overpowered walnut & rose water taste!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Incredible service and great food. Amazing Lebanese food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not really impressed! We ordered a Chicken Shawarma Plate and also the Vegetarian Plate. The Chicken on our plate was either hard as a rock or mushy like organ meat. There was not one piece of fresh chicken on our whole order. Our pita bread was not warmed, like most other restaurants I've been to. I asked before I left to Make sure I had the appropriate sauces I paid for for  my meals, cashier assured us that we did. When we got to our destination we realized all of the accompanying sauces were not present.  No tahini, no yogurt, no garlic sauce! The grape leaves on the Vegetarian Plate were tasty, but they were empty! There wasn't anything stuffed inside, except for sadness. The ONLY thing we had out of the two plates that was fresh was the falafel. I could tell they had just made it. It would have tasted even better with the sauce that was intended for it.   I am most certain that we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I haven't even tasted the food yet. But let me tell you that I will NEVER be ordering from here again. I tried this place when it first opened and it was horrible. But it seemed to have gotten bette rover the years, so I decided to give it another shot. I ordered through YELP but if you ask the guy running the place you can't do that and you have to order through EAT 24..not sure if he knows EAT24 is a YELP company? After what seemed like forever he finally gave me my food- while making it sound like he was doing me a favor, giving me something I paid for. Making me feel like a complete idiot even though I showed him my order history, proving the order he was holding hostage was mine! Unbelievable, I have never had this issue anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but price too hi for the amount of food they give , clean place , service could be better , I won't go back again"}
{"text":"This was the worst shawarma sandwich I had.  The bread was very hard, very little meat and I could not taste the garlic sauce in which I asked for extra garlic sauce.  The fries were skinny and hard.  Don't be trick by the cashier when placing a order.  He will say \"The sandwich comes with fries or salad, which one would you like?\"  Negative!!!!  He is really adding on fries and a drink for a extra $$$. Be prepared to be on the toilet for a while after eating from this place."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations with the food and customer service! 
I wanted a little bit of everything so I got the platter and it was all amazing! 
I shared the platter with a friend, and we were very satisfied and still had food left over! 
Very affordable with a nice atmosphere.
Wish we had this place near where I lived, because I would be going every week! 
Would definitely eat again when I visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I brought my very picky Hispanic grandmother here and she loved it! :) food was great; full of flavor and the staff was very welcoming. It's so far from home but very close to my job, so hopefully we meet again!"}
{"text":"I had an excellent chicken shawarma. Generous portions. Very authentic. They have an amazing selection of Lebanese food. Friendly staff. Reminds me of grandma's cooking. I will definitely come here again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Went there tonight and the lady up front was very kind , place is clean. Food taste good , soup was excellent . Next time I'll try the kabobs ."}
{"text":"Ordered in for lunch and unfortunately the hummus un inedible, they must have missed a key ingredient.  the Falafel was previous frozen then re-heated.  We were really excited to eat here but sadly wont be returning"}
{"text":"My friend ordered French fries. The ketchup on the table was expired and ruined the fries. When we mentioned it, they didn't do anything about it.
The baklava was old and stale.
The falafel that I ordered was acceptable."}
{"text":"Heads up about my reviews a rating of five star for a hamburger joint and a five star for a fantastic steakhouse just depends on them delivering what they're selling flawlessly.

 I didn't want to go here, but my girlfriend insisted on a shawarma and I loved it. It was great, the meet was good filled with delicious fresh vegetables, tomato, cucumber very nice sauce plenty of meat... more than I couldn't  finish and delicious fries. 

The place is Clean pleasant spacious and Decor is inviting and friendly staff. 

If I'm back in the Las Vegas area, I would definitely give this place another visit."}
{"text":"Really great fast fresh Mediterranean food! Good prices and the staff is super nice! We went at the end of the day and they gave us free moussaka!"}
{"text":"I usually don't post many reviews on yelp and as a \"foodie\" who eats out every meal, this place deserves some recognition. I had the chicken shawarma, tabbouleh salad, hummus, pita bread, and gyros. Oh and don't forget the dipping sauces!!  I hope you like garlic because the garlic dipping sauce is amazing. If you're looking for amazing, great quality Mediterranean food, this is it. I can't wait to go back and try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Fresh cooked to order, great falafel and i enjoyed the grape leaf wraps. 
They have a veggie version as well as normal rice. 

Definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Our 1st time here & I fully intended to take a picture of our food but as soon as it was set on the table...it was gone!

The owner was so helpful & friendly. It was obvious he is very passionate about his restaurant & thankful for his customers.

This is the best place to go for fresh, healthy & tasty Mediterranean. My husband (meat eater) raved about his chicken dishes & I thoroughly enjoyed my Vegan dishes! Best falafel I've ever eaten & trust me, I know a good falafel.

We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"They change up their menu options frequently. Today I had the vegetable moussaka, the eggplant with beef and a salad. They give you a good amount of food and I finished everything on my plate. It was all so good.  I love the little details, like the rose water iced tea. It is so different and refreshing. 

You should stop by for some good food."}
{"text":"Shawarma Plus without a doubt is a go-to Mediterranean restaurant as it's delectably dreamy with a variety of authentic dishes that urge a sense of immediate elevation in mood like your palate has been enriched by only the finest traditional flavor of it's kind served throughout history yet while you're in a calmly casual setting. Above all, the owner's warm promptness proved charmingly genuine which reflects the service and quality."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely terrible. Takes half and hour to get a shawarma plate and on top of that it is terribly overpriced."}
{"text":"I found this place by mistake. I really wanted a falafel and they hit the spot. It's clean inside nice people so far I have eaten there twice and I'm happy each time."}
{"text":"This place is so special to me. I have been eating veggie plate more than twice a month here for over a year and I am delighted every time. The two owners and hostess Verona are so sweet and welcoming. Super fresh ingredients and flavorful sauces make their food a winning combination. Try their falafel sandwich if you are in a hurry. It tastes good even after hours.  Hubby always goes for chicken plate or gyro sandwich and loves it. Do try their baklavas, great variety. 
I wish they could include some house-made drinks in their menu, other than regular sodas."}
{"text":"Great food!  Just had dinner here tonight and everything was delicious.  Very authentic (as far as I can tell) and fresh.  Reasonable prices and the management was so friendly and accommodating. We are going to try to get back here before we go home!"}
{"text":"Very bad service , bad attention ( te atiende la propia dueña cómo mierda . Me salió un pelo en la sopa el shawarma está quemado . Tienen buenos comentarios pero en realidad la forma de enfrentar las situaciones es desagradable ! The worsted customer service"}
{"text":"Not bad! I'm becoming a fan. My friend said he always drove by the place and always wanted to try it. It's in a corner I never look at, and the font they use for their sign is thin. They do have a lot of food pictures plastered in the front of their restaurant. Can't see the inside because of it. 

When I went inside, they had premade food already to be served and made into a combo for, I believe $10.99. This place seems like it's great for lunch or people on the go. I love that!  Everything looked very delicious, but I was on the hunt for kabobs! 

I went to get the lamb and beef kabobs plate. It was $11.99, and it came with rice pilaf, lots of vegetables, hummus, and some pita bread. 
The garlic butter it came with was intense in taste! So, I used that very lightly. The pita was warm when I got my tray, the hummus had some lemon tang kick to it that made me lick the plate, the rice was light, the salad had some sort of dressing I wasn't familiar with but was still addicting, and the best part of the whole plate were the kabobs! Both the lamb and the beef were moist, and super tender! It was cooked to perfection!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! lol. SO GOOD. 

I'm going to admit, I may go here after work! I need to try other things in the menu. Thank god for closing at 9pm! 

I will recommend this place to everyone! 

Just don't forget, this is in a small plaza across from where popeye's chicken and a gas station  is. It's easy to miss. Corner of Sunset and Decatur. 

DO IT. :)"}
{"text":"We ordered dinner to be delivered to our house. The delivery was fast. We had a mix up with the combo due to an error on our part. The owner called us personally to explain why we didn't get fries with our gyro. He was very nice, personable and understanding. This is a man who cares about his business. 

I only gave it 3 stars because the food itself was just ok. I ordered a shawarma salad and added chicken. It came in a clear container with a \"Best Buy\" date sticker and a label stating what kind of salad and a price tag so I know this was not made to order. I work in a hospital so it reminded me of the cafeteria there. Baba gnoush was packaged the same as well although that was absolutely delicious. The chicken on the salad was so hard. It was like the outer part of a store bought rotisserie kind that had been shredded off and left to sit for days in the frig. I took it all off and gave it to the dog. He was happy. The dressing and salad itself was good though. 

I think if he presented his food in a more fresh way his business could thrive. Cafeteria style is not attractive. Especially since we paid $33 for a gyro, tea, salad and baba gnoush that was low quality. He is a good guy though. Maybe he will read this and take some pointers from an outside perspective."}
{"text":"I drive by this place almost everyday, today was the first day they were own on a Sunday so I decided to stop in. The owner greeted me and was very friendly. With his help, I decided to give their specialty a shot.  The beef and lamb shawarma was tasty. I never had anything like that before. Their taziki sauce was full of flavor yet not overpowering. It was busting with meat, and had a nice crunch from the veggies inside. I'll definitely be back to try their other home made specialties."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch b/c we had a Entertainment coupon. Unfortunately, we came out with a very negative feeling of this restaurant.  The coupon was a bogo coupon and we were told we would have to purchase 3 items, not what the coupon related.  AND we were told we had to purchase the combo (an extra $2.99 x 3) also not on the coupon. Paid over $25 for 3 sandwiches, not good fries and drinks and that is with the coupon.  I have emailed the Entertainment coupon book as well. Honestly, this is just wrong and a total bummer. I am hesitant to use the word \"fraud\", so I won't but we had thought we had found a great place to eat consistently and now we won't be back. Check feed for pic of coupon that we used and you decide what you think it states."}
{"text":"I love coming to Shawarma Plus! I love kabobs and for me, this is the best kabob place here in Vegas. The food is very good! I always order the beef kabob. It comes with rice, salad, pita bread, hummus and some sort of garlic butter on the side. Their hummus is fresh and refreshing. It also always comes with like a garlic butter and it goes good with everything. Service is great! Come check them out!"}
{"text":"When approaching the counter I wasn't even asked what I wanted, just aimed to  the plate, that gave you selections of bland and dry shawarma and chicken that have been sitting there  god knows how long (arriving later in the evening I should have seen the angle of dumping the old food on me instead of offering fresh items). 1 dollar more gets you a precut piece of cold pita and 2 dollars more gets a a runny bland hummus substitute. Never again, a couple of bites and in the garbage."}
{"text":"Food is good but what kind of a place doesn't give you pita with an order Babaghnush? How are you supposed to eat it, with a spoon? Friendly advice, offer free pita with dining in sides"}
{"text":"0 complaints, and lots of compliments. The guy who owns the place is very nice. The food is great, and it's the best Tabolleah that I've ever had. The prices are worthwhile, and everything looks clean in the front and back of the house!! I love it since I grew up on home cooked Lebanese food. Unfortunately, my grandma passed away, so this makes a great alternative!!"}
{"text":"Real legit Greek and Lebanese food, fresh and clean, nice people too! Highly recommend this place and when in town in coming back!"}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for quick Mediterranean cuisine, I don't order anywhere else! The food is always hot and delicious & the portions are filling! The owner really makes this place something special though. Every time I've been here he is always incredibly friendly and helpful! If you peek into the kitchen and behind the counter it's very clean and organized as well as throughout the rest of the dinning area. You can really tell he takes pride in his restaurant. Overall I have nothing but nice things to say about Shwarma Plus."}
{"text":"I only ordered this on a whim because it's close to my work and I needed lunch. I was blown away! I had the chicken kabob plate and it was so good. I couldn't finish it as it was a lot but I saved it and ate it the next day too. Super yum."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First time was good, second time a few hiccups. Order the feta fries and they were cold, nothing special just fries with feta thrown on top of them. Also got the falafel, which I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Great service! Cashier and the manager are really sweet! 

Food: 
I got the chicken shawarma plate. It's a large mix of white and dark meat. And it's a little salty. 

I'm not a dark meat person nor do I prefer the taste of salt in my food! But that's just me! If you don't care about salt or the location of where your meat comes from, then you would enjoy this spot. 

Food also comes out very fast! A+

I really wanted to love this place but I didn't. I've been spoiled with better, unfortunately!"}
{"text":"My friends highly recommended this fantastic restaurant. I starting eating Lebanese food only in LA as I couldn't find a decent place to eat in Las Vegas....I ordered pick up at 8:45, very late, long  business day. They were very accommodating as they close at 9pm and I was very greatly for that. Thank you 

Not many great places left in town for good old fashioned Lebanese style cooking. 
I don't know where the owner is from,the restaurant was closed and I picked up my food at the front door but the food is on point. The meat shawarma was really good, tasty and perfectly done, fries extra crispy with garlic sauce amazing! Fresh pita, fresh salad and the hummus smooth and tasty. 
I ordered the vegetarian plate as well, everything was really really good. I loved all the food. I definitely will be back to try other dishes. 
Thank you for the accommodation of late order pick up."}
{"text":"I come here during my lunch break and I always walk out satisfied. One of my favorites would be the falafel sandwich. The grape leaves are good too just need a bit more rice, but still filling."}
{"text":"I was craving Mediterranean food.. So I yelped. This place came up with a lot good reviews and the pictures helped as well. So I decided to give it try. I ordered the chicken kabob plate. From start to finish I had a very great experience. The lady who took my order was very nice and let me try the baklava before I bought it. Oh so good !!! My food was amazing !!!! The hummus is smooth and tastes great with pita bread you get with ur meal. Its a lot of food. And its great! I recommend this place when your in the mood for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Shwarma PLUS gross food EQUALS a bad stomach ache.  This place is way over rated.  

FOOD: The chicken kabobs were overly dry, the hummus and ganouche was unflavorful, and EVERYTHING had salt like crazy.  The salad, rice was super salty. and i usually love heavy tasting things, garlic,spice, soy sauce.  The meal was completely substandard.  It is a fast food type mediterannean.  Far from a gourmet mediterranean chef type food.  The panini which i ordered came on a pita bread instead of french bread.  Cant get a sandwich right??  I totally regretted not ordering the mediterranean hamburger.  But i thought hey its a mediterranean restaurant so ordering med food cant go wrong right?

PLACE: in fact the place looked and felt like a fast food restaurant.  It looked like it was converted from a pizza restaurant.  The problem is the price is completely unjustified.  Our order came out to be thirty something dollars for an order or kabobs and a panini.  Even at a restaurant the pita is free for dipping on ganouche and hummus.  Here they charge.  

THE LAW: like star wars, Stay FAR FAR FAR AWAY in the next galaxy.  For the price and the crappy food, go to a real sit down mediterranean restaurant.  Go to maza grill.  10x better.  Really wanted to like this place.  Their marketing posters are amazing and showed some awesome food that made me go in there.  Total trojan horse."}
{"text":"Always have wanted to eat here for months! Today I finally did! Me and my friend were warmly welcomed by Naji and made us feel at home. I had the rice with lentil and onion, lemon chicken and salad. My friend had the one with meatballs and I think the lemon chicken as well and salad. The food was delicious and tasted homemade. Verona provided great service on our Baklava purchase. She took time to tell us what's in every package and packed us some honey on the side so the pastry will not get soggy. Overall, I loved my visit and enjoyed my food. The dining area was suitable for food consumption. The amount of  food for the price was decent. I will go back and bring more company."}
{"text":"Always so amazing, always so friendly! I've yet to have anything here that wasn't full of flavor and served with a clearly grateful smile. We decided to try the shwarma pizza tonight because, why not? Had I of known how rich and delicious it was going to be I would have had a really hard time deciding what the heck to order. So we all decided to order our first choices AND get a pizza to share. We all had vegetarian plates that were perfect, an order of baklava that was out of this world, very fresh and crunchy filo dough.

We have yet to have a bad meal here and I don't expect that we ever would. If you are up in the air about where to get food tonight, today or anytime.... get your pitabuns to Shawarma Plus!!!"}
{"text":"Annoyed. This place is slow to kick food out. My whole lunch break wasted and there is no one here. I got the beef shish kabob plate this time around and I'm so upset. The meat was so tough, flavorless and burnt =( I can't believe I paid for it. I ended up throwing most of it away. Total waste of $15. I would like to add, do not come here if you are in a rush or on lunch break.... I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"this had to be one of the worst places to eat.. also very expensive. I really don't have much to say but I've eaten at shish kabob which is my favorite and let's just say this place doesn't even come close. don't waste your money here guys because I already did. there's no love in their food and you will not enjoy that you paid that much for what you got."}
{"text":"Tried this new place today with my husband, plus it's just around the corner where we live... The food are soOO good specially the Baklava! (I'm a very big fan of baklava & very choosy).. It's as close to authentic mediterranian food as it gets! Very light & yet very very tasty...
The owner is very friendly too & very hands-on with everything..."}
{"text":"The food is good, the garlic sauce is way too strong it kills all the flavors, the wraps were over toasted it was crunchy , the falafel - kibbi - kabob are really good here.. the place is very clean and the prices are very decent."}
{"text":"The owner was supppppperrrrr friendly you know he loves what he does. I requested sauce on the side, chef forgot abt it but the owner was care enough to offer redone the plate. Hummus was decent, the garlic sauce was unexpected good!!! Portion is big, more like 1.5 meal...chicken was not bad. Overall is pretty good, will defly come more often."}
{"text":"First time here and I tried shawarma beef sandwich. It was soo good! The bread was thick and also it comes with either fries or soda! Pretty worth it and the owners nice. He gave is free food since they're closing soon. Would definitely come back again for the shawarma! :-)"}
{"text":"Service is excellent, the guy who took our order was very friendly. Salad is fresh and the lamb is super tasty. I'll definitely be back whenever I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"The chicken schwarma is phenomenal! Best chicken schwarma I've had in Vegas. My hubby and I both got it. We also ordered a lamb gyro. We weren't very impressed with that one. The lamb was good, but it needed more sauce. The hummus and pitas were very good as well. The fries were delicious too. So for the food, all was great. Service was great too. The restaurant was another issue. The tables were sticky and the salt shaker was FILTHY. It was so dirty, I was afraid to touch it. There were supplies in the dining room and things were just generally messy. The kitchen looked clean, but a bit disorganized. I would have given this place a solid five stars if the dining room and tables had been cleaner. I'll be back for the schwarma, but I think I'll take it to go.

3-28-18 Update: Went back today. Got the Schwarma chicken again and it did not disappoint. We also got the vegetarian plate and the chicken panini. The panini was good. This was my daughter's first time having falafel and she LOVED it. It was REALLY good! The tabouleh was amazing as well. I'm going to go back tomorrow for more because now I'm craving it. We did get our order to go this time, and while we waited for our food, I noticed that filthy salt shaker again."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I had the gyro platter, it came with a Greek salad, humus. There was so much I couldn't finish it!  I highly recommend this fantastic restaurant! 
I will be be again! (I live 1.5 miles away!)"}
{"text":"Best Arab food in Las Vegas!!! Great environment, good prices, free wifi, and friendly workers. As an Arab, I can attest to the authenticity and deliciousness of the food. They have a wide selection of food from falafel to shawarma and excellent baklava for dessert. A must go to in Las Vegas! Will definitely become a regular!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a whim, assuming it was a kabob place, like Flame Kabob.  Oh boy  was I wrong!

It had a buffet of food to choose from, and ALL of it looked amazing.  Super clean, lots of bright, airy seating...

the man behind the counter was super friendly, and I chose moussaka and chicken with rice for my two-entree platter.  He gave me veggies in addition.  I was intending to save half for lunch tomorrow, but it was so completely amazing,  I ended up eating the whole thing!

Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"First time here but have ordered from here via Uber Eats a few times before. My Husband was the one who opened up my pallets to this type of food. Mediterranean food. I enjoyed it. Definitely something new full of flavors. I do have to say that I was not pleased when we came here. The chicken fingers they have pictured and advertised was not what came out. Although, it was good and packed with flavor it was not what my kids pictured and wanted. The service was pretty bad. Both registers had the same order #s and the lady was talking me like I was dumb when I asked if our # has changed. Overall not the best experience. The gyro we ordered was not fresh. Lacked flavor and was extremely messy."}
{"text":"So yummmm! Our new place for sandwiches! The bread is amazing and lots of meat in sandwiches"}
{"text":"I grew up enjoying good shawarma. Every city I've visited has a great place that serves shawarma. It's usually the places that aren't fancy and uppity that has the best version. Sadly, in this town, I've not had a great shawarma. A gyro is not a shawarma! 

Beef and Lamb Shawarma:
The bread is thin and crisp - not doughy. Hooray!  The garlic sauce was great but there just wasn't enough in my shawarma - I'll ask for extra garlic sauce next time. You can taste mint, cucumbers, meat...mmmm...4/5

Chicken Gyro:
They have a special on this for $3.99. So, why not? There was a pickle and a french fry in there - not sure if that was by accident or they're really part of the gyro because that's just weird. 3/5

Fries:
Nothing special. 3/5

Rose Water Iced Tea:
Some Rose water teas can taste like soap. This was just perfect. 5/5

Baklava:
Not too sweet, just right. The natural oil from the walnuts was making the filo glisten a little bit much. 3/5

The lady behind the counter was friendly. The place was clean and they let us in a few minutes before their actual opening time which is at 10am.  This location has only been open for about a month. I'll be back...more garlic sauce!!!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the friendliest places with outstanding Mediterranean food. What a great restaurant!  Excellent lunch!"}
{"text":"Where can I start?
When I eat at a restaurant, I only pay attention to two factors: customer service and taste.
This little restaurant more than surpassed both of those categories. The gentleman at the cash register makes you feel at home and comfortable. The place is clean and has a chillax vibe.
Regarding the flavor: I got lamb and chicken kabobs. So far the best Mediterranean I've had."}
{"text":"This is most  definitely the best Mediterranean place in Las Vegas. The mousakka was perfect, the hummus is great, the dolmas are killer, the stuffed cabbage entree is life changing. The service in this place is world class, the guy that runs it is reason enough to come check it out, and they deliver!! I can't say enough good things about this place. I wish there was more than 5 stars to give them."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma and my friend ordered the daily 2 entree special and it was delicious! The host/cashier was very pleasant, explained everything to us, and friendly. Definitely coming back! Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Shawarma's are really good! Ive also tried the kabobs which were a little overcooked. Lamb is a beef mix which disappointed my husband-chicken seems like your best bet.  Hummus and baba gnoush we're also very good. Really friendly place, clean..I've been a few times now and it seems consistent in quality however watch out on combo pricing as it can get pricey. Ive learned to skip the fries and get a drink instead as the shawarma is plenty. I wasn't completely sold on the grape-leaves or rosewater tea..tea was a bit like i was drinking incent water & stuffed grape leaves seemed bitter but im not sure if thats just normal. Not for me i suppose. I will stick with the chicken shawarma"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mediterranean food I've had in a while! The hummus was so good I bought some to take home! Definitely try the baklava too, amazing!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time ever.  Been to a million of these places back home but never here. Ordered a falafel and was satisfied.  It's served rolled in the pits unlike other places that stuff it. Could have used not tahini for my taste. Would I come back? Sure! Only giving it three starts because this is my first time here.  Not sure what anything else is like but I have no complaints.  Next visit might be a four star review.  You won't regret this place."}
{"text":"First time eating here & it was great! Friendly staff & good customer service! I had the gyro chicken with fries & a drink for only $8.99! Definitely a bang for a few bucks! Would definitely recommend my friends and family about this place for first timers or lovers of middle eastern food! Need it come back soon again!!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the rave reviews here. 

Was not impressed with the price or the quality of the food. 

Came in for lunch and ordered a 2 skewer plate, and a 2 item cafeteria style combo, with 2 drinks it came out to $30. 

For $30 the portions were pretty small but worse than that was that it was fast food quality. Flavors were off, and the meat was dry and over cooked. On one dish the meat was very bland. And on my chicken skewers were overly sour from the marinade. Even the grilled tomato was hard and unripe. 

Definitely, will not be returning and can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Being middle eastern in vegas comes with a downer of not having any decent restaurants to eat at! Until I found this place. Not the most convenient location but the food is worth the drive. I have recently became a vegetarian and let me tell you there are countless dishes to satisfy anyone! The falafels are great. I love getting the platter because it comes with all the pickled goodies. The flavors are authentic, exactly what I'm used to. Most importantly the garlic sauce......it's the real deal people. Other places mix garlic with mayo...yuck! This is the real stuff. No fillers. The owner is very friendly and is always there, making every experience his customers have better and better."}
{"text":"The best kafta I've ever had! Good costumer service, people are nice and food is excellent!"}
{"text":"I came in around 5:45pm Wednesday night ...I ordered TO GO a gyro and tabbouleh .... I was craving lamb... It was decent!  I'm spoiled..in Ohio we have some of the best Greek food EVER!!!!  I'd probably not go back or try it eat in rather than take out....but it kinda hit the spot for my craving and being only 15 mins from home!   Verona the lady who greeted and packed my food was very kind and friendly...she told me about the specials and was a pleasure ... :) thanks again guys!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken kabob and they were very small pieces of chicken.  Way tooooo many tomatoes in my salad.  Wanted to sample the salad and was told they don't do samples.  Mind you we just brought two platters.  We asked for a water cup and he told us the bottle water was $1 but u have water on the fountain????"}
{"text":"The hummus was ok, the chicken kabobs were under cooked/unedible. The lamb kabob was so so. The vegetable soup tasted like water. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been to every iteration of this space from Chicken Bonz, to Meat, Chix, and Weiners (lol!) and finally I've gotten to try Shawarma Plus. Wife and I came in to check it out and we were pleasantly surprised. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the owner who showed us all the specials that were made for the day. I was introduced to the Chicken Mousaka which was so good. I have also tried their Chicken Shawarma Pizza and their classic Gyro Pita with Greek fries. Their food has been great every time and this is one of the spots I crave every week or two. Great food and atmosphere. Always something new to try on each visit."}
{"text":"It's a great shawarma place in a mall. Not a fancy place to have shawarma but the quality is good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get my Mediterranean fix! The service is always incredibly friendly and they treat me like I'm family. I came here when it first opened and it is still as clean as it was then and very well kept up. The owner takes pride in his business and makes sure my order is always perfect and fresh. The food is always bomb! I order one of the varieties of the sandwiches most of the time and it's absolutely delicious. Try the baklava too! Very authentic. Definitely a favorite in town and I recommend it regularly to my friends."}
{"text":"if i could give this okplace no stars i would they messed my food up and the refused to fix it  on a delivery order"}
{"text":"Awesome Mediterranean spot in a strip mall. I got the lamb shawarma plate (pictured) and it was all that for only $11.99!! Added a side of falafel bc you can't come to a Mediterranean place and not get falafel. Everything was so savory and delicious. The garlic sauce on the side was so flavorful I wanted to take home a container of it. The shawarma itself was perfectly seasoned and cooked. They also have fresh homemade baklava available throughout the day. Definitely worth a stop in for a quick bite. Lots of food for real cheap!!

They also have the most delicious tea brewed with rose water! Never had it before here and it blew my mind and made my tastebuds dance! Unique flavor that I will definitely be coming back for"}
{"text":"This place has potential, a nice open seating area, classic arcade games (Star Wars, Mrs. Pacman), and a very friendly owner (I think).  The food looks good and next time I will try something other than the gyro plate. Ok, time out, this \"greek\" restaurant decided to americanize the name of things such as \"grape leaves\" instead of dolmades and lasagna instead of Pastitsio.  Not sure if it is so people know what things are called or because they make it different.   The plate lunches come with hummus, pita, gyro meat, and salad type fixins for the gyro plus either fries or a salad.  Not bad for 11 dollars and change.  The food was very filling.  

I was disappointed with the gyro meat.  Although they shaved it off the rotisserie machine, it was actually quite dry and crunchy.It also didn't have a lot of flavor especially on the lamb end of things.  

The sauce was decent but lacking in the minty flavor I'm used to.  The pita is a very thin pita rather than thick ones associated with american gyros.  I prefer it that way.

Hopefully, they will get the message and find a way to get their meat a bit more flavorful and moister.  Still, If you are in the area, it is nice to have choices now."}
{"text":"This has got to be a joke. The chicken shawarma has the texture of sawdust, the Kibbe tastes like mini corn dogs, and to get the combo is 2 extra dollars to add a drink. You read that correctly. It reminds me of chuckie cheese on the inside; bright neon colors, video games. All I could keep saying as I entered the door was,\"Disco-disco\" as the LED disco ball was making its rotations; all the while making zohan tag lines. I'm confident my insides are layered in a thick film of grease from the amazing minced beef inside the kibbeh. Friendly, but irritated staff made the experience all the more merry as Christmas music blazed from the speaker system. I'm a bit of a Connoisseur of arabic food and in my opinion, this place fell short of taste, flavor, and originality."}
{"text":"The food tasted fine but both myself and my girlfriend became ill after eating here. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is more like a fast food restaurant.  The food is only average and some of it did not seem fresh."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing outstanding just what you expect from semi-fast food Mediterranean.  The baklava left me with a frown.  My lamb gyro looked more like a burrito than a gyro but it was tasty.  The side of fries were good and there was a decent amount of them.  

The place could be cleaner but it wasn't filthy.  The BigAss fan in the center of the room is more annoying than a comfort bringer.  The order caller is a bit rude but maybe that is part of the kitsch of this place.  

I can't say I hated this place but I doubt that I will return.  There are so many other places to spend my lunch dollars."}
{"text":"Poor poor service from beginning to end ! The girl at casher needs some training. The food is ok but because of service won't go back."}
{"text":"Had never had this type of food so I had no clue what to expect. It was absolutely delicious and I was not let down of my expectations, had the Chicken pizza and it was absolutely wonderful! The place had a unique color scheme and reminded me a bit of Cafe Rio. Would defiantly go back especially since the staff was very helpful in menu knowledge and helping me pick the right food since I had never been exposed to this type of food."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place out. We were both craving Greek so it was perfect timing. This is one of the only Greek places I could find worth trying out on the southwest part of town. We got a gyro plate which came with a very generous amount of lamb meat, veggies, salad, and some pita. The one thing I look forward to eating when i am craving Greek is the pita, and this pita was a huge let down. It was little hard (dare I say old) pieces of pita that came cold in a bag. 

Dear, warm, soft, and fluffy, pita, I missed you! 

The hummus was great and the lamb was good but a little greasy. If I am craving Greek again I will probably see if the sandwiches are a little better, but I probably won't get the plate again."}
{"text":"Good Mediterranean food,. I found my spot when I'm graving for Mediterranean cuisine.. highly recommend."}
{"text":"Prices were $2 off from website versus going in the restaurant. Food was nothing to write home about. Service was lackluster."}
{"text":"I've only had the chicken schwarma plate here & it's delicious! It's a huge serving so it usually lasts 2 meals for me. Everything has a great flavor & I especially love the garlic spread! The staff here is also very nice & greets everyone with a big smile. I haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"I planned a surprised birthday party for my wife and ordered on the catering menu and it was AMAZING! 
Everyone at the party loved the food especially the gyros and chicken shawarma! People who were vegetarians loved the salad and dressing!  They loved it so much, some of them took the menu pamphlet.  When I arrived the food was ready, hot, and prepared. I even had help with carrying the food to my car.
Thank you Naji for your help and making it an easy day for me to host the party.
I would recommended this place to anyone, especially for catering needs! 

Neil"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this place ZERO Stars because they gave me ZERO Service. 

Customers calling in over the phone prioritized over Customers Physically in the restaurant. I waited at the register over 6 minutes without ever being acknowledged. The Employee was on the phone with someone the entire time. Two customers came in behind me and also waited. They had less patience and left after not being served. About one minute later...I also left. This place is near my home so I thought I'd support a nearby business. After this experience, I shall never return to spend a dime."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this place. We walked in and I wasn't very impressed by the food selection.  The lady working pointed out two pieces of meat sitting in juice and told me how great it was.  I asked if they could make me a shish kabob and she told me in order to make this they have to know 2 days in advance?? I was starving and tried the mystery meat which was absolutely disgusting.  And cold! Never again. They tried to soften things by loading the plate with extra potatoes."}
{"text":"Can't believe I forgot to update this! I went back about a month ago and ordered the same thing. Falafel was made to PERFECTION! And, the owner really is one of the friendliest people you'll come across. I love that he took the time to comment on my original review too."}
{"text":"I figured I better try this before it was gone.  It is a lousy location and doesn't look like much from the outside.  To my surprise, when I stepped in the door, it was busy!  The food was good and the gentleman at the register was very friendly.  I wasn't a fan of the rose iced tea, but that is just my personal taste.  I hope others support them."}
{"text":"So full and already thinking about coming back! Friendly staff, homemade deliciousness! Gotta try all the baklava, & don't forget the rose water iced tea!!"}
{"text":"Wow... Talk about false advertising. I was really hungry and in the mood for some Mediterranean food. So I ordered a gyro and a meat pie. The \"gyro\" is not only the tiniest gyro I've ever seen in my whole entire life, but it also looks like a burrito. There's such little food inside that they actually were able to close it up. The \"meat pie\", which looks like the size of a nice empanada in the menu, in reality resembles a skinny, limp... Egg roll. None this even looks appetizing in the slightest. If I had the time, I'd go and get my money back. Seriously. 

***
Update... They did give me a refund with no problem. I do understand that people have different tastes. My biggest reason for the low rating is that what is advertised does not match what I received. Neither item even resembled the pictures on the website."}
{"text":"I love how colorful this location is! Every staff member was very helpful nice friendly and welcoming. I love that they had the option of high alkaline water that goes along way!! A Power Water! Food was very tasty. I'm big on Mediterranean food so I can be very picky with it. This place is definitely a good place to stop in for some Mediterranean food. I recommend coming here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The best shawarma sandwich I've  ever had. I'm so happy I found this place.  The owner gave first class customer services. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Food tastes good don't get me wrong. The amount of meat (4 pieces of chicken and 4 pieces of beef) for 12.99 is, however, unacceptable. Another issue, I despise them asking for tips when you pay. If I have to stand and order. Pick up my own order. Eat from from styrofoam with plastic cutlery that I have to get myself and then finally clear the table myself the PLEASE Explain what it is that I would be tipping for?????"}
{"text":"Had the serious displeasure of eating here this afternoon. A friend wanted to try this place on a whim and I agreed. 

If you didn't know any better, you might have thought you were walking into a 99 cent Chinese food establishment (case full of weird pre-made food) or is it Mexican? The multi colored chairs and tables scream Fiesta. And old school video games along the wall? What?! Not really sure what this place is. 

The gyro I ordered was decent sized, but it was not even a gyro. It looked like a sad burrito. The chicken inside was beyond dry and it was supposed to have tzatziki sauce in it (it didn't). It was dry and tasteless. Soggy French fries. The baklava tasted like it had been made days before, it was not fresh. Asian lady behind the counter was nice though. 

This place is NOT authentic. These were not very good Mediterranean recipes. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My new fav place to eat!! I love that they have so many options, and every one is better than the next! First time I went there, I got the gyro wrap... best gyro wrap I've ever had! The second time I went there, I got the chicken shawarma sandwich. I loved the chicken shawarma so much that the next time I went, I got it in a wrap. Loved the garlic sauce that they spread on the sandwich!! The latest thing I've tried is their Mediterranean style burger... the meat melted in my mouth. SO DELICIOUS!!! Best part is I just call ahead while I'm on the road, and the food is ready right when I get there! Awesome customer service!! Way to go Shawarma Plus!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered their #2 Shish Kabab Double: chicken and kafta. Absolutely delicious! Their hummus is the best hummus I have ever had and I travel all over the United States for business and vacation. Their Rose Water is A-MAZING! I would highly recommend this restaurant and will surely come back to eat here again. Their staff is super friendly! A+ in my book."}
{"text":"Oh gosh. I did not like this place one bit. This was probably the worst Mediterranean food I have ever had. Keep in mind this post is from someone who loves salt. Everything was LOADED with salt, and I mean LOADED. I had the chicken kabob plate and the babaganoush. The rice and the salad that came with the chicken were loaded in salt. The chicken was dry and super salty. It's hard to taste the natural flavors of food when it's sooooo salty. I would never come here again. I was originally brought into this place because of their great marketing strategy. They have posters of delicious looking food all over the outside of the restaurant. It looked delicious and made me hungry. I am extremely disappointed. A total travesty."}
{"text":"Let me tell you this who ever disliked this place and put in bad reviews is totally wrong. Me and my husband came out here for Vacation . And we looked up a shawarma restaurant and shawarma PLus came out first. I am a very satisfied customer from this Restaurant everything about this place was just perfect The atmosphere the service and the food was just perfect if I can give this place 100 stars I would do it!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious gyro! Very unique twist on it. Pizza was ok but I'll definitely return for the gyro."}
{"text":"I work nearby and there are limited lunch options in the area.  We were excited to add a new restaurant to our lunch rotation.  We almost removed them from our lunch rotation when we visited less than two weeks after they opened.  

We arrived just as they opened for lunch and the food was bland and so soft all the textures were the same.  Just a hot and soft mess. It's what happens to food that has endured several heating and reheating cycles which means it was probably days old.  We've encountered this several times.  You just have to come in when you're feeling lucky.  When you don't get leftovers, the food is good."}
{"text":"My husband just picked up some to-go food, a gyro and vegetable soup.  The gyro was inedible.  The wrap was dry and cracked open everywhere when I picked it up.  The gyro meat was lunchmeatie tasting.....the veggie soup had no veggies but maybe a potato piece and green bean....just broth.  I used to love this place but no any longer."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Verona was great! Very welcoming and good customer service! Yelp showed they were open at 10am on Sunday's but apparently they don't open til 11am. Verona was kind enough to open the doors for us at around 10:30am. Food won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to a meeting at a nearby office and decided to stop by.
The menu had the usual array of menu items that you'd find at a GOOD Mediterranean restaurant, and I went for the Gyros Sandwich combo (fries and drink).

The total was about $11.  
I LOVE Gyros, and I LOVE Mediterranean food.
Unfortunately I didn't like what I had here.

The Gyros meat was lukewarm and cold towards the center, and the fries were ALMOST warm.  It's pretty hard to screw up a meal like this, but they seemed to manage doing it.

The dining tables had a sticky film on 'em too.  I guess they were cleaned, but the solvent or detergent they're using is either not the right stuff for the job or they're using old mop water to wipe the place down.

The day and time of my visit was Thursday, Jan 8 at 6:30pm."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I come here for lunch at least once or twice a week. Service is always great - food is always amazing, full of flavor and they go above and beyond adding additional onions / cheese / dressing or whatever to meet my needs at NO EXTRA CHARGE!! Highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a great Mediterranean Restaurant"}
{"text":"Great food. I recommend the veggie sampler plate. Add some chicken and you're good to go. My gf usually doesn't like grape leaves but she loves these. 10/10 will eat again."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this place and the food showed up warm to Luke cold.  Also,  the steak and chicken was super dry along with the Rice.  Not worth the money you pay for the dish.  It was all sloppy on the dish they gave us.  The salad was also soggy.  I would not recommend going here."}
{"text":"after a long day at work my employees and i came to shawarma plus and devoured a lamb plate!!!! amazing!!!! perfect meal salad hummus n rice! the the lamb shawarma rocked and amazing grape leaves.. 

next time its kabob time!"}
{"text":"Booh! The shawarma was not anywhere close to good. I had the beef shawarma and the meat was dry and rubbery, it wasn't even shaved off, it was already pre-cut and cooked on a grill, not like the real shawarma meat that is slow cooked at all. I spent $10 on lunch with drink  and some oily fries, i ate 1/4 of it then threw it away... what a waste... oh well you gotta try it so you know. At least now i know..."}
{"text":"It my first time here and I order the chicken & beef shish kabob come in plate with salad, rice, hummus & pita bread is was delicious!! Specially the hummus so good. I would come back to try the rest of the other dish again.  I even brought some of the hummus to go!! 
Overall everything good!!!"}
{"text":"The worst part was the owner.   He tried to upsell us on everything, and when we refused we saw after we sat down that he charged us anyway! When we pointed out that he got our order wrong, he refused to do a refund and instead offered us free baklava which we had already turned down during his up selling shtick.  

Our food was poor. The chicken was very dry and over seasoned, and the items in the food bar were overcooked."}
