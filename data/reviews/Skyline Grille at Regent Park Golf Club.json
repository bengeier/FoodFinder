{"text":"What a great 19th hole to finish a round.   So you just finished golfing so it is mandatory that you get yourself a beverage and some food. My go to here is the undertaker burger which comes with an egg.  Damn't burgers with egg you always put me in a conundrum. Do i eat something awesome and suffer with 3 yr old sticky hands or go with something easier?  I always double down on sticky hands.  The beer selection is pretty good and Dale's Pale ale used to be only $2.  It is 2.50 now which is still a great deal. The only problem with this place is that you can't get your burgers cooked medium rare and that chips are the side instead of fries or something else."}
{"text":"Lots of people live in Regent Park. Almost none have ever eaten here. They pass right in by it on their drive out of the neighborhood headed to one or another chain. This is a locally owned restaurant. They have some quirks but it's worth a stop as they do try really hard to give a good experience. 

Patio dining here can't be beat on a nice day! The beers on tap list continues to grow. The burgers are predictable. Occasionally, daily specials are real hits. Food ranges from exceptional to mediocre. Nothing bad, just occasionally mediocre. They also run catering for the golf course. Service is usually top notch."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and comfortable atmosphere. We'll be back."}
