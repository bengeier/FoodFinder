{"text":"The pizza is great here. But steer clear of the specialty ones if you have any concern about price. They gouge you on those. ESPECIALLY if you get a sicilian specialty. They have some really weird way of calculating that cost and somehow ends up like 30. The pizza is good, but it has to be covered in gold to be worth 30.   Their wings suck, according to my gf. I don't like wings, so I have no idea.  We'll probably go back because it's really close to our house and the pizza is great. But we'll stick to plain!"}
{"text":"The Pizza Stop is down the road from us a convenient location to pull in for a pick up order! My favorite is the Sicilian Pizza! Love it! The Pizza Flips are Amazing too! As well as Huge! We recently had an Italian Pizza Flip and fried zucchini delivered and they were Excellent! We also use The Pizza Stop for our kids parties when ordering lots of pizzas for the kiddo's. Julie the owner made sure everything went perfectly with our 10 pizzas delivered and all the kids loved it! I would recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"I went and got pick up here last night. I went with a special they had on their website--the family special. For $25.50 we got a choice of a large plain cheese pizza, a full hoagie , a dozen wings and a choice of a half Galton turners tea or a 2 liter of soda. We went ahead and did half meatball and half pepperoni on the pizza, which was decent for pizza. Then, we got the Philly cheese steak, which was good, but a little light on the inside. Next, we got a dozen of the sweet and tangy wings. We liked these better than the additional dozen of mild wings we got. Lastly, we got the fires and cheese. The fries were nothing special, but just standard frozen fries with cold cheese. They forgot the ranch we ordered and they only have one phone line, which ended up taking like ten minutes to take my credit card between timing out and taking phone orders. I would give this place another chance at some point, but it was a bit underwhelming the first time around."}
