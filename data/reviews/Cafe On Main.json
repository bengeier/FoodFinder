{"text":"Came through after visit to local hospital. Hands down best omelette I have ever had. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, and went almost every week. About two months ago the service got really slow on weekends. There would be a huge line and open tables, but the tables took 20-30 minutes to get bussed. For a small place, that needs to be taken care of a lot quicker.  The food also went down hill. One time, both of our orders had 2 cold potato pancakes and 2 warm ones. The eggs Benedict specials were always my favorite, until the eggs started to be cooked poorly. Last week I actually got sick after. I would still go there for pancakes and scrambled eggs, but nothing else. The people are super nice, but too slow and too few staff on weekends."}
{"text":"I'm new to Yelp. Otherwise, I would have reviewed this place years ago. Found it by accident after going to St. Vincent de Paul's thrift store. My favorite place in all of Allegheny County for breakfast. It is a cute, well maintained, clean place. Love the atmosphere. Gina is an exceptional, friendly waitress. Knows me so well that she has a can of Coke for me as I'm coming in the door. Always asks how my mother is. The food is always very good, made from fresh ingredients. Hard to get breakfast anywhere else after eating here. Try one of their many fancy omelets. And their breakfast potatoes. Lunch is also very good."}
{"text":"The Cafe on Main in Sharpsburg is often overlooked when Pittsburghers are pondering where to go for breakfast. I've always thought it was a shame that this place wasn't more popular as they serve a very good breakfast.  Their pancakes are flavorful and come with many options (blueberry, banana & chocolate hazelnut, choc chip & pecan, etc), their omelets are loaded with fixin's, they use a quality ciabatta bread for their breakfast sandwiches, their corned beef hash is outstanding, etc.  The only breakfast item that I would ding are their sausage links.  They look, taste, and have the texture of pre-made, pre-cooked, links that have been microwaved. In fact the sausage links seem like what you'd get at McDonalds.   So, you're probably wondering why did I give them just 2 stars?  Well, I brought my brother, sister-in-law, & nephews in from out east and my mom & Dad in from the North Hills to enjoy a Father's Day brunch at the Cafe on Main.  My Dad arrived early and took a seat in their waiting area.  Dad gave an older \"gentleman\" who appeared to be running things (the owner?) his name and the size of our group and was curtly told \"we don't seat you until everyone is here.\" My Dad clearly wasn't asking to be seated in the dining room yet - he had settled in on a chair in the waiting area. A few minutes later my Dad asked this \"gentleman\" if he could have a cup of coffee. The response? \"I'm waiting on customers.\"  So I suppose an elderly man who has told you that a group of 7 will be eating at your establishment on Father's Day isn't a \"customer\"?   Our full group arrived and after waiting about 15 more minutes (Dad had patiently waited, with no beverage, over 45 min) , we were seated.     Our waitress was nice and helpful.  She would disappear for long stretches but we knew it was a busy day for them so we didn't get frustrated.  As various people finished eating she was quite prompt with clearing the table, which we appreciated. As our meal was winding down, I paid the check so that would be taken care of and we could leave as soon as everyone finished eating.  Given that it was a holiday and I could see how hard she was working while keeping a smile on her face, I left a 30% tip.   So, it seems we have a delightful Dad's Day, right?  Well, almost.  Despite the fact that two people in our group were still eating, the \"gentleman\" who was running the show came over to our table and quite rudely told us that \"people were waiting\" and we needed to \"move on out.\"  His tone was abrasive and there was not even a hint of courtesy.  Please keep in mind that we had waited to be seated too, once we were seated the waitress did quickly ask for our order but when we asked for a \"few more minutes\" we ended up waiting almost 15 to get her back to the table. The food was also slow to come out.  What I'm saying is that we weren't dilly-dallying and holding up progress. We were at the table a good 30 minutes with no food.  We had been at the table about 1 hr and 15 min when the \"gentleman\" essentially kicked us out. About 40% of that time was waiting on his restaurant to serve us. Two of us were still eating when he asked us to leave!   I understand that small restaurants need a turnover but there's a polite way to encourage your guests to finish up and there's this \"gentleman's\" way.  Both my brother and father, the two we were celebrating today, were disgusted by this \"gentleman's\" behavior and told me that they would never come back here.  A lovely meal ruined by a crabby ol' man with a sharp tounge."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Ordered the Dublin Benedict with grits, and it was great. Potatoes & onions were perfect, as was the bread. Nothing terribly unique, but each item done right.  Drive by and you'll think no way. Walk in and it's unassuming. But you won't be disappointed.  And service was nice. She was busy, but come on, it's not a factory, it's people."}
{"text":"This is the best kept brunch secret in Pittsburgh. I don't know how Blakely (the chef) does it, but this place has THE BEST eggs. Everything is fresh and delicious. I come here every Sunday, rarely have to wait to be seated, and I am greeted and welcomed by name. The staff is amazing: attentive and beyond friendly. This is the Cheers of brunch! You will love this place!"}
{"text":"Only reason this place is getting 4 stars is because of the service. I understand that it is a family ran business and you are busy, but a smile wouldn't hurt every once in awhile and maybe not having conversations about guests right in the middle of the room. We only keep coming back for the food...it's absolutely amazing and has never failed us."}
{"text":"Delicious and innovative food, friendly ambience where \"everybody knows your name\".  Great creative omelets."}
{"text":"Been there once and plan on going there again. Gets four stars because of its hours of operation being limited. Wished it was open for most of the day"}
{"text":"the food is amazing. truly.  the breakfast options are standard fare with inventive twists: why, yes, i would like brie with my eggs and peaches with my pancakes. my friend and i *had to* order the stuffed french toast as a brunch appetizer bc there were just too many extraordinary things from which to choose. her friend potatoes were the best i've ever had.   the waitress was friendly and attentive. if i lived closer i would definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"Cafe on main will be my new breakfast spot. Everything was amazing. Cozy, quite and friendly staff. But most importantly the food was the best I've had at a breakfast place in a while."}
{"text":"Excellent Norwegian Benedict and home fries"}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere.  The wait staff is very nice and take care of you. The pancakes and sausages are awesome."}
{"text":"We went to Pittsburgh this summer for a few days to visit relatives, and we found this breakfast place.  We loved it so much that we went back every day we were in town.  Excellent food, great service, and an all around great time."}
{"text":"This place really is a gem, tucked away on Main Street in Sharpsburg, Pa.  My two experiences have both been with brunch, but let me tell you.....each time it has been unbelievably tasty! I have ordered their steaks and eggs which is out of this world. My table had eggs benedict, and some other egg dishes which were all greatly enjoyed as well. Not to mention you get a free mimosa with your meal!  What makes the place even better is the atmosphere and service. Both are outstanding! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my visit to Cafe on Main.  My husband's Belgian waffle was cooked to a crisp. It wasn't burnt, but it wasn't fluffy at all. I was hard and dry. It was supposed to be lemon poppy-seed flavored, but I couldn't taste it.  I ordered the eggs benedict special, but without the meat, and with the eggs cooked so that they practically hard-boiled. My meal was delivered with meat on the sandwich, so I sent it back. When I finally did get my order, the eggs weren't cooked as well as I like. While not runny, they were still pretty gel-like. I know they probably rushed to get them out due to the mix-up, which I appreciate to a point, but...  The hollandaise sauce wasn't impressive, either. It missed that tanginess that makes hollandaise sauce so irresistible. This was just bland yellow goo atop the egg.  I did like the potato pancakes, but they were tiny. I left hungry and bored.  The server was pleasant and prompt with refills, and the dining area was cute, but those small positives aren't enough to outweigh the fact that food was mostly boring and/or bad."}
{"text":"Excellent! Went there for breakfast on Valentine's Day. I generally dislike heavy meat-and-gravy type food, but the biscuits and gravy (using a waffle instead of biscuits) was superb! I ended up eating half of my husband's dish. Also, the seasoned potatoes were tasty. My lemon poppyseed waffle with blackberries and cream (special menu I think--likely not offered regularly) was only okay, but my husband liked it so we shared and all was well. A cute little place we will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Disappointed on my second trip there last week. The first time there 6 months ago it was great. Really good-and I couldn't wait to go back.  But this time my omelette was very overcooked, dry and flavorless. My companion's corned beef hash was very greasy. Probably wont be going back."}
{"text":"I was super disappointed by this place.  We got there and there were plenty of 4 top tables available, but since we were a table of 5 and their 6 top tables were taken we had to wait.  Even though they could have easily pushed 2 of the 4 top tables together.  I understand they'd rather not waste a 2nd table, but there were 4 or 5 empty tables, so it didn't make a lot of sense (and there were still empty tables when we left).  They finally squeezed all 5 of us onto a 4 top, which was fine, but sort of awkward.  Following this, they didn't take our order for more than 15 minutes, even though they really weren't very busy.  These were both mildly annoying and I wouldn't have thought anything more about it, but the worst part is that they included the gratuity and made it a presumptuous 20%, which was sort of the end for me.  I'd been there once before with a party of 6 and they did not include the gratuity then (which is usually the minimum for when they'll include gratuity, but is still traditionally only 18%).  I think they assumed we were unhappy and wanted to make sure they still got a tip (which we would have, but the whole point of a tip is for service.  Had I known you could just add your own, I would have done that a lot more when I was a waitress).   I just thought the entire visit was rude and left a bad taste in my mouth.  They made a point of saying \"please come back again\" when they gave us our check, but frankly I'm not sure why I would.  The food was good, but then there are plenty of other breakfast places with good food that have far better and friendlier service."}
{"text":"As a frequent diner at Cafe on Main, I must admit that I am a bit biased at this point.  I always go on the weekdays even though I have frequented it twice on weekends.  The difference being the crowds and the wait.  It's a pretty popular place. The omelettes are sizable and all ingredients are fresh.  The coffee is above par.  The breakfasts are great, the lunch menu sports some great sandwiches including a decent Ruben. Gina, the server and Jack of all jobs there is amazing...great conversation, pleasant, efficient, and attentive. My only request is that they made just regular fries...not those seasoned ones.  They're good but nothing beats a French Fry au naturale."}
{"text":"Nice service, decent price, very good food ! Gotta love the well run family resturants, they have a personal feel to them."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here for Sunday brunch whenever he visits. I love the Man Waffle and he's never had a bad omelette there; they're always perfect! Their Snickerdoodle coffee is the best. Not to mention the complimentary mimosas!"}
{"text":"So so so so GOOD!  Really might be the best breakfast/brunch I've had in Pittsburgh.  I've been there a ton to visit my sisters and we always try to hot spots (Pamela's, Kelly O's, etc etc).  The nutella/banana pancakes at Cafe on the Main are to die for.  Large portions (too large to handle but hey you have leftovers!), perfectly cooked pancakes, perfect sweetness.  The potatoes with onions have an amazing flavor.  The coffee was delicious.  And the service is excellent - really friendly - really down to earth place.  I come back here for brunch each time I come back into town now!"}
{"text":"Good food and fine people.  There breakfast is awesome, but their catering could be better.  I was very happy with the food, but my family was rather disappointed.  Go there for breakfast first and explore from there."}
{"text":"Pretty good! We came for brunch on a Sunday in the late morning. It seemed pretty busy, and an older gentleman directed us to our table in the front of the cafe after just a moment of waiting. He was quite abrupt with customers, not super friendly, and kept addressing our waitress with questions while she was trying to help us. That was pretty annoying, as our waitress was great, but her ability to serve us was happened by him not just letting her do her job.   Complementary mimosas was a fun surprise! I ordered a platter that included two pancakes, eggs, home fries, bacon, and ciabatta toast. The serving sizes are plentiful, so you could probably split that platter with someone unless you're really hungry. I normally house my breakfast food and didn't eat my eggs, half my potatoes, and one whole pancake. The pancakes are fluffy and great. The home fries are just large pieces of red skinned potatoes. The flavoring was nice and they were cooked well, but they would have been a lot better cut smaller. Coffee is pretty good. Service wasn't bad. I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Cozy breakfast spot with different offerings that your usual breakfast spot. Be prepared for a bit of a wait on a Sunday morning. They get very busy! The Man Waffle is definitely something to try. Also a complimentary mimosa is a nice touch during brunch. The only thing I didn't like is that my large cranberry juice cost $7 (or they charged me wrong.)"}
{"text":"Awesome Spanish omelet and the bacon is unbelievable!  Chef greeted us at the door when they opened and the wait staff is really friendly and efficient.  I'm coming here every time I come to Pittsburgh and you should too!"}
{"text":"Wow! The spicy omelette and red skin home fries are out of this world! Truly the best I've had."}
{"text":"(I sorta don't want to let the secret out...)  Cafe on Main is a Sharpsburg breakfast joint with a local schmocal feel , and that is why I give it 2 thumbs up.  I love a place where you feel comfortable.  The atmosphere makes you feel like you are in your own dining room having a meal with your long lost relatives.  Strangers chat like family and everyone says \"Hello\"  You are greeted with a feature board that always has sweet and savory items prepared for the day.  They have an open kitchen set up, so you can see items being cooked and the chef always gives you a smile.    Oh yeah, lets talk about the food.  There is so much of it and it is so good.  Everything is always so fresh, hot and made to order.  Eggs are perfectly cooked and the ciabatta is a great compliment to any meal.  I, personally, am excited that grits are an option for a side.  I had my go-to corned beef hash and over easy eggs.  I couldn't even finish it with my side of bread and grits.  A lot of bang for your buck.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and Aaron and Gina know my family just from coming here frequently.  The home fries are the best I've ever had.............I try to go elsewhere, but keep coming back!! I love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast spot.  Once we walked in we got greeted by a friendly, cheerful, jolly old man (the father of the owner) and he was great. He told us about the specials and just made us feel so welcomed.   I ordered the eggs benedict which were yummy! The poached eggs were done beautifully; the yolk poured out as I cut my eggs in half, just the way I like it and the way it should be. Their home fries had so much flavor and tasted good. My parents shared the mushroom omelette and french toast which were tasty as well.   The service was spectacular! Our waitress looked like she loved her job and her tone of voice, her attitude just made you feel a whole lot happier. The father of the owner came around and pretty much talked to every table. They told us about the owner's sister's restaurant close by since we aren't from around the Pittsburgh area. They were all so helpful and attentive.  Definitely recommend trying this spot!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe On Main twice now and I just keep wanting to go back.  When you walk in and see that the specials board is as long as the menu, how can you decide?  Part of me wants to go back every day just to see what new items are being offered....but then again, part of me is afraid to because it all sounds so good.  I've selected the Eggs Benedict special both times.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious, and you can tell that great care and thought has gone in to each dish.  The home fries were some of the best around.  Most recently I was there on a late Sunday morning.  Imagine my joyful surprise in learning that a complimentary mimosa came with my menu selection that day!  As if the fantastic food and great service weren't enough.  I can't wait to go back.  Drool creeps down my chin just thinking about it..."}
{"text":"We found this place using Yelp! We are always liking for options other than your typical chain restaurants around. Sometimes they are hard to find even In Your own backyard.  Look no further than on Main Street in Sharpsburg! Located right off the bridge headed to route 28. We were looking for a place on our way to Pittsburgh Mills shopping center. Also it's an Easy entry back on to 28 after your done.  Charming old building on Main Street provides for a comfortable setting inside. Specials listed on blackboard as you enter. They have some amazing offerings for breakfast. (See photos)   With so many different options, you are certain to find one for everyone in your party. we choose the pancakes with bacon, dippy eggs with yummy spicy, but not too spicy sausage, and the amazing omelette filled with roasted red peppers, provolone cheese, asparagus and ham. everything was delicious! The omelette was amazing! The potatoes were seasoned perfectly! We now can't wait to now try lunch if we are nearby.   Service was fast and efficient. They were not warm and fuzzy, but food was properly prepared and we never waited for refills. The only recommendation I could make would be to tell the servers to smile more! :) hence, the 4 instead of 5 rating.  Summary: Do yourself a favor and break away from the chains and go here! Who wants to really wait for 1/2 hour or more to eat at Eat-n-park anyway???? We didn't even wait here, just sayin."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. I would recommend you get here a little early because the place is small, but if you have to wait a little it is worth it. Priced very fair and the menu is great, not overloaded with too many items.   Give it a try you will be pleased."}
{"text":"I've been to cafe on Main several times. It's good. The waitress was friendly. Fortunately we stayed to find that out. Our initial impression this time was minus 3 stars due to the rudeness of front staff when you walk in. I understand they don't like to seat groups until all are there-all but one were there and one was on way. No, nada no way were we going to be seated until all were present. Once we sat down,  our table was so close to another.  A staff person was talking with the guests at that table. She would not step over to allow me to sit. We had to move the table and she still didn't step aside. I thought she might tell  us we couldn't move the table. Back to breakfast- it was good. We had waffles and omelets  with toast, fruit and home fries. The coffee was warmed up once but no refills  on water. The kicker is that at 25% tip was added to bill!  We were a group of 5.  It wasn't a 25% experience by far. When paying I asked if we could leave a cash tip. I actually had to ask !! We left a nice tip but it wasn't 25% !! Food may be good but it's better to be nice."}
{"text":"This is a fun breakfast spot with great food and excellent service. Yes, they have traditional breakfast fare, but they also have some amazing gourmet offerings that are delicious.  The portions are generous and the prices are affordable.  I am always greeted warmly and my order arrives quickly.  There's a local feel to this restaurant which adds to the appeal.  I notice regular diners who arrive to see their friends and neighbors, but I know they are also coming back for great food."}
{"text":"We recently ate here on a Sunday afternoon.  We had Peach Cobbler Pancakes.  Truly enjoyed these!  They were a thinner pancake with delicious peach fruit and peach syrup drizzled over the top.  We also tried the potato pancakes, but they were nothing special.  Service was good, the atmosphere was very family friendly oriented. Complimentary mimosa was a nice touch. Definitely recommend for brunch!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Saturday. Solid, unfussy menu. I was very happy with my mushroom omelette, and the coffee wasn't bad either. Very cute place."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. It's a little more creative than the usual breakfast food (and you'll pay a little more for that too, but it's all in the ingredients). I got corned beef hash and grits and I was pretty happy with it. Service is spotty, so budget a lot of time to be there, this will be a leisurely meal. It's kind of worth it though.  Side note: we were offered mimosas half-way through our meal. I didn't see them on the menu so I have no idea what their liquor situation is or if mimosas are always available."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good neighborhood café that serves up eggs 18 different ways?  I dropped in here a few weeks ago to have a hearty breakfast before attending a series of dance workshops at the studio across the street.  I glanced at the many specials before opting to start simple with eggs benedict (you can tell a lot about a place by how well they can pull off this dish) and coffee.  They delivered well on both counts.  That coffee was hot, good, and kept on coming!  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  The fresh fruit that went on the side was very good for it being an off-peak season.  As I glanced around, I could tell I was among locals, perhaps regulars.  Service was prompt and attentive.  While I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way just to dine here, I'll be glad to swing by when I'm in Sharpsburg for other events."}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast the other day.  Go early because the place fills up fast. It was quite hot in the restaurant.  The service was very good and the staff are all friendly.  I do believe the prices were a tad on the high side. $3 for a cup of coffee. Our breakfast with tip was $30 for 2 people. My waffle was nice and crispy but the gravy was overly peppered. Hubby had the spicy meat lovers omelette with grits and loved it!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice German omelette and grits. Nice atmosphere and a complimentary mimosa. Thanks."}
{"text":"food-average at best ,wife had pancakes-dry and chewy,I had a chicken sandwich-atleast 2 day old ciabatta roll and loads of olive oil dressing in the sandwich.say whattt??saving grace-fries! That speaks for itself.  service-POOR.we stood 15 mins to be seated while atleast 7-8 tables were empty.the server (who was doubling, tripling as other roles) chose to clean the tables before leading us to our table, which by the way didn't need clean up.Absent minded or plain insensitive? We almost left because of the server's attitude."}
{"text":"All I can say is FANTASTIC. The omelet I had was absolutely delicious. Great & quick service. Comfortable atmosphere. Very cozy. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Yummy food at a great price!  I walked into this restaurant with really no expectations.   The menu had a some interesting options for breakfast.   My waitress was extremely friendly and made sure to introduce me to the owner.    I felt very welcome.  There was a line but was seated pretty quickly in this cafe setting.  I ordered the German omelet with Potato Pancake.  The german omelet was a corned beef and kraut.  The mix was surprisingly very good.  The potato cakes were not great - after tasting the omelet - I had higher expectations.    The sour cream and applesauce provided me a oktoberfest memory that made me long for a stein of beer.  Though I was full and my big boy pants were stretch to capacity - I did order one apple spice pancake.   WARNING - THE BELOW COMMENTS WILL MAKE YOU IMMENDIATELY HUNGRY AND LONG FOR A STACK OF PANCAKES ...  Okay - maybe the above commen is over the top but the cake went down so fast - there are no pictures.   Maybe it did not even exist but oh boy - was it good.   I believe they sautee paper thin sliced apples in butter seasoned in cinnamon.  After the apples are softened, they pour their pancake batter.   The pancakes are thin.  Summary:  Atmosphere - nice - 12-15 tables in a small room.  You are pretty close to your neighbors but still a nice atmosphere.  Service - Great / Super / Friendly - My waitress made me feel welcome and ensured my food was hot and coffee plentiful.  Price - $9-$13 - I did order a pancake with my breakfast  All was awesome and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Other than the fact that you're probably always in for a wait because it's a popular albeit small local cafe, there is little to dislike about Cafe on Main.     First off, there are complimentary mimosas on weekends.  Secondly, the food is fabulous.    Their home fries are crunchy and toasted on the outside but soft on the inside.   They always have innovative specials on the chalkboard in addition to their main menu.   From lemon ricotta Belgium waffles to omelettes filled with items ranging from avocado to sun dried tomatoes, you are in for a treat.   The food is cooked perfectly, priced reasonably and there is plenty of it.   What more could you want?  Also, the gentleman who serves as host on weekends is a treat.  Chatty, social and just a little quirky, he makes your experience fun and interesting."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I had a Greek omelet and it was amazing. My bf had pancakes, sausage, and eggs. He is extremely picky and said that all three items were the best he has had in a long time. The service was fast. Our waitress was couteous. Limited seating so you may have to wait. Cute, country themed interior. I was told that the owners sister owns Cici's down the street. I wish this place was open more. I have been trying to eat here for a while!"}
{"text":"Overall: Awesome breakfast cooking, but service attitude left much to be desired. We felt rushed at the end and miffed with the overall dining experience.  This place has really awesome food, if you are willing to accept the somewhat aloof server attitude...  * Norwegian Benedict: Fantastic combo of perfectly golden poached eggs and smoked salmon, covered with a smooth hollandaise sauce that has just the right tartness and creaminess, delightfully paired with a small bowl of fresh fruit. $11. * Malibu Omelette: Hearty portion of scrambled eggs wrapping generous slices of avocado, mushroom, and spinach, paired sumptuously with delicious home fries. $10. * Pancake: Yum! $3 for a single. * Breakfast Sandwich: Very tasty set of scrambled eggs, cheese, and thick slice of ham held loosely between buttered and lightly toasted ciabatta bread. $5.  * Coffee: bland and served in an overly small cup (6 oz?!), with refills slightly difficult to come by. $3. * Hot chocolate: bland, despite being specially made and blended to kid's temperature. $3.  ----  What follows is borderline TMI on why we felt dissatisfied with the service we received.  Depending on your familiarity with the staff, YMMV, so take it with a grain of salt and a light heart.  If you are the establishment reading this, I hope it helps you in a constructive manner to figure out how add new clientele, or at least make the present clientele dine more happily.  Perhaps this *is* the Sharpsburg of Pittsburgh.  Perhaps it's been a tough year.  Perhaps we were just too different, too out of place.  Perhaps the servers have had a tough morning, what with the rain n'at.  Whatever the cause, we felt neglected from the moment we entered the cafe door into an ordering area bordering a fully-staffed kitchen of 5: no greetings, barely an acknowledgment despite my radiant smile to convey that, \"We came in peace, and very hungry!\"  The sign into the dining area told us to wait to be seated, so we did.  More than 5 minutes later, a managing lady finally came out to ask how many we had, and proceeded to get a table ready by cleaning up a just-eaten table, when we could see two other unoccupied tables.  She at least asked if we needed a high chair for the baby.  In contrast to the rest of the staff, server Lisa was much more attentive and all smiles. She came by with a drawing board for our older child, asked if he wanted crayons instead, and also to ask if we got our drinks ordered while the main server was busy elsewhere.  She brightened our day!  When the main server finally came by, other than one chitchat comment about our baby being adorable, she plainly asked for our drink order, to which we responded that we'd already given it...perhaps that's when it went south.  After our drinks were brought to us, she asked if we were ready to order; we told her we were, at which point she left to tend to other tables, only to come back a few minutes later to ask again if we were ready to order.  Our main server seemed less than patient and barely attentive when my wife was ordering.  In any case, by the time we placed our order, at least 15 minutes had transpired from our initial entry.  Food preparation took place quite promptly, and we had food on our table in a little under 10 minutes.  Very soon after we had seated, while we waited, my wife began feeding the little one, a process that usually took 15 minutes.  So when our food arrived, we were able to focus and eat, tending to the snack needs of the little one occasionally when he screamed a bit.  If the occasional screams bothered the staff or other patrons, they only protested with, \"Aw, what a cute baby!\"  Partway through our munching, the main server came by with our check, which seemed fairly normal.  However, what followed didn't seem quite the norm to us.  In short, less than half an hour from when we got our food, our main server came by to collect payment, saying something to the effect that a party of 9 was waiting outside and that her manager just wanted to close out transactions.  No kidding?!  We were not entirely finished with our food; and I'd only had ONE coffee refill, nothing close to the 300mg caffeine I required to operate.  I looked at a nearby 6-person table whose 2-party patron was nearly done.  I was a bit miffed at being rushed.  So while I took out my payment, I told our server that I felt a bit rushed.  She asked for my tip due to my card having a chip (really?!?!), and then told us that we could take our time, keeping in mind that the 9 are waiting.  Not wanting to keep a crowd more than twice our headcount waiting in severe hunger, we quickly up'd and left, with no intentions of coming back, however mouthwatering my favorite benedict.  Really, the server could have waited a few more minutes; I also would have happily paid at the counter.  In my model of restaurant service, this experience deserved a one star, had server Lisa not been there, and if not for the delicious cooking."}
{"text":"Always a great place. I usually get there JUST before it closes but no one ever fusses about it. Food is filling, delicious, very home style. Bread is excellent. I've got nothing but praise. One of the best breakfast places around."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place to date!  It's a little pricey, but worth every penny. They always have such great, unique specials (my go-to is always the Norwegian Eggs Benedict- comes with smoked salmon). The staff there has always been nothing but friendly for me, and I love the feeling of this little quaint spot!  Keep in mind that because it is a smaller site, it gets very busy during peak hours. Worth the wait in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch about a week ago. The food was pretty good but the service was a quite slow. We waited about fifteen minutes just to order. For what it is, I think it's a bit overpriced. I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! Had a goat cheese, zucchini, tomato, & spinach omlette that was giant and delicious. Had a side of fresh fruit-yum! Hubby ordered eggs/potatoes/bacon/ and blueberry waffle. Everything was so fresh and tasty. The staff was super friendly and made you feel like family. Will be back as much as possible!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in town! Their many varieties of omelettes are second to none - fluffy and FILLED with all kinds of good stuff! Also, they serve other delicious items. The coffee is good and so is the friendly service. Love this restaurant.!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in Pittsburgh. Very unique omelette creations. All specials are listed on a chalkboard when you walk in. Gina is a friendly and great server. Will remember you which is becoming a lost art. Very fast service and reasonable prices. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Service sucked. Manager too busy with cross word puzzle. Food has been better. Omelet was dry."}
{"text":"Adorable little brunch spot in the heart of main street Sharpsburg. It's decorated beautifully with charming garden decor that makes it feel incredibly homey. It is quite small inside (probably only 10 or so tables), so expect a bit of a wait on the weekends (they do turn tables over quickly though).  The food was phenomenal. They had a huge list of specials chock full of seasonal ingredients, as well as a comprehensive regular menu. We each couldn't decide what to get, so we went splitsies -- among the two of us we ordered the peach and brie stuffed french toast, banana Nutella pancakes, and an order of home fries -- and we shared it all.  Everything we ate was divine. The french toast was made with thick bread that was cooked just enough to give it a lightly toasted outside while still remaining soft and tender inside. The brie cheese was velvety and mild and nicely complemented the spiced, succulent peaches. Yum x 1000! The banana Nutella pancakes were also heavenly -- soft and tender, spiked with real bananas throughout, and covered with tons and tons of Nutella. It was sweet and sinful and everything a good breakfast should be. And let's not forget the home fries. They consisted of chunks of beautifully seasoned red potatoes that were cooked to perfection so that they had a nice caramelization on top, but remained fluffy and tender inside. We left completely stuffed and satisfied, with motivation to do little else for the rest of the day but nap ;)  Service was fast, friendly, and efficient. Our waiter was very attentive and even offered us a complimentary mimosa while we waited for our food. The owner's father chatted us up while we were waiting in line and after we were seated at our table. He was really friendly and seemed genuinely interested in getting to know us. That really added an adorable element of \"mom-n-pop-ness\" to this place. I do have to take off a star in this area though, because at one point he yelled a joke to us from across the room that contained an ethnic term that is outdated at best and at worst could have potentially offended someone. I know he wasn't trying to make anyone uncomfortable (I think it's probably a generational issue), but I'm taking off a star just because I think you have to be sensitive to that sort of thing.  Overall though, we had a great meal in a great setting, so we'll definitely be back. This is an awesome alternative to some of the more well-known and overcrowded alternatives in the East End brunch scene."}
{"text":"I especially love the italian omelette. Nutella and banana pancakes are delish. So they mix the banana with the pancake and cook it as such and generously drizzle Nutella on the top most pancake. Also the French toast is good but I was kind of sad I didn't see the Brie and peach option on the menu :(. It was good too. Even without he aforementioned. I haven't been able to walk since 3 hrs ago so hope you have good food coma pills handy. Try it out. I always do take out."}
{"text":"This restaurant made our family of8 wait 45 minutes while taking in smaller groups like 4 and 5 who arrived after us.  Small tables can be pushed together OR extra chairs can be squeezed in for the children in our group!!!!!!!!!!  The cooks are very talented and the breakfast meals were very tasty.  Somewhat $$$pricey though -for 6meals with coffee the bill was $130."}
{"text":"I jogged by here many times, and hadn't a clue about what was inside.  I took my family for breakfast today based on reviews I read here.  As mentioned, it is very small.  We had to wait a bit, but it was completely worth it.  For as simple as it appears from the outside, it has a great decor inside.  The food was fantastic!  My daughter loved the blueberry pancakes.  My wife and I both got omlets, and they were perfect in every way.  I don't know how they made the home fries as good as they were, but the did.  There are more unique omlets that I can't wait to try when I go back."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there today and it was fantastic. Great Food with unique selection of omelets, nice portions, wonderful service, friendly staff, not too loud (but it was full), plenty of parking on the weekend. I have found the best spot for breakfast without paying a lot for a fancy brunch. I would go back there anytime."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and restaurant. Food wasn't too bad. But, $3 for a cup of coffee is steep and $60 with tip for 3 people to get breakfast is pricey. Especially for sharpsburg."}
{"text":"This little spot is very accommodating and friendly. The host was very friendly and helped suit us with a table right away. Even though there was a line we managed to be seated in only 10 minutes. I'm sure the group behind us wasn't to thrilled to see us seated before them but there was only 2 of us and 4 of them so the larger tables were limited.   There was a small dining area when you first walk in . Only 3 tables mostly for 2 guest. The one we sat at could seat three but after order our food and beverages there was no more room on the tables. We ordered our breakfast in a timely manner. I took notice in the corn beef hash special. It came with the hash, sunny side eggs, and toasted ciabatta with grits. At only $9.00 i was very happy with the meal. My hubby ordered the Mediterranean omelette that also came with ciabatta and he ordered potato pancakes. Everything was delicious. The bread was perfectly toasted, the hash  was so delicious and not greasy, the grits had lots of flavor and weren't over cooked or dry. I LOVED IT!! the omelette had kalmata olives in it that made this dish burst with flavor and it was a pretty big omelette.   The main seating area only had about 9 tables so it's a pretty small place. But, the one thing i love about small places is the attentiveness that the servers have for you. They came back to the table frequently to make sure we were enjoying our selves and they even offered us complimentary mimosa's. i couldn't turn down that offer.   I especially enjoyed how the host came and sat at our table telling us stories from his past while also boasting about the great eats this place had to offer. He was about 70 and so generous to sit and talk with us about his restaurant. We loved the conversation and would definitely return again for sunday brunch. I only wish that this place would stay open a little later but given it's location i guess business would suffer more than succeed."}
{"text":"I hesitated to leave a review because I want this place to remain a secret! It is our weekly Sunday brunch spot. We joke that the food is everything you wish you could make at home, but 10 times better because someone else makes it! It is simply delicious. Our favorites include the breakfast sandwich, the Malibu omelet, and the banana pancakes. The homefries are the BEST I've ever had. The food service is prompt, so even when it's busy, which it often is during the weekend, tables turn over quickly and the wait is not long. This place does homecooking right, and we are so happy that we discovered it (via Yelp!) almost 2 years ago. We are proud to be Cafe on Main regulars."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my breakfast at Cafe On Main.  I ordered from the specials menu and had the... \"Mr. Tom\" Turkey Benedict. Which was homemade stuffing, roast turkey, cranberry sauce, and poached eggs topped with hollandaise sauce. It was delicious! One of my all-time favorites. However, the people at my table who ordered the breakfast sandwiches were underwhelmed. The sandwiches were small(ish) with ciabatta bread... the bread was really hard, once toasted, and it didn't come with a side dish. So they weren't as happy with their meal as I was.  My brother just moved to Sharpsburg, so I foresee myself eating here again."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast, everything was delicious! Service was great! Would definitely come back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"We came to Cafe on Main for Sunday brunch and didn't expect it to be so popular, but there was a 20-minute wait. (No problem; we just went snack shopping across the street.) When a table was ready, we were asked if we were okay with the table at the corner of the waiting area. With all the sunlight coming in from the window behind it and our stomachs growling, we said of course. There was even a hook next to the table for our jackets! I got the corned beef hash with egg and potato pancakes. Yum! Very oily, but hey it's breakfast. Boyfriend got steak, eggs, and home fries. He was annoyed that part of his egg was placed on the handle of his steak knife when it was served to him because it made the handle oily. Other than that, everything was good. Would return!

{"text":"I had a western omelet and it was the best I've ever had and I've had a lot. The homefries were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The service was also exceptional."}
{"text":"I'm not even a Pittsburgh native, and plan to move back to Philadelphia soon....but the thought of having to leave Cafe on Main makes my decision that much harder. I don't think I've ever liked a breakfast/cafe more. And trust me, breakfast food is definitely my thing. It's not only their fresh, huge, amazing omelets with the best cheeses and vegetable combos you could imagine. It's not there perfect breakfast potatoes or complimentary mimosas, or delicious ciabatta toast. It's not because it's one of the few breakfast places in Pittsburgh to serve Eggs Benedict, which is on my list of top five favorite meals. Actually, those all definitely add to it. But really it's just one of those places that I don't think I'd ever mind waiting, or sitting by the door when the dining room is too full. It's got character and you can tell everyone who works there seems proud to, even if there a little stressed out from a Sunday crowd."}
{"text":"Cafe on main has a delicious breakfast menu. Love the omelettes and eggs Benedict. It has a quaint small town feel with a great server named Gina. She should be running the place!"}
{"text":"We found Cafe on Main through a serendipitous drive. It was a great find! The omelets are amazing, and a complimentary mimosa was very welcomed.  Our server Marshall took great care of us.  We plan several return visits, despite a half hour drive."}
{"text":"Amazingly good monster-sized portions.  Fantastic hidden gem.  Cannot recommend enough.  Friendly service in a smoke free environment.  I am totally stuffed.  I need a nap"}
{"text":"This was our second visit, as we had stopped back in April for brunch and were highly impressed. In fact, of all the diners we have visited, it was arguably our favorite. Unfortunately, this time it wasn't quite as good.   First of all, I don't know if the A/C was broken, but it was very warm inside with little air circulation. On top of that, the waitress took a while to get our drink order, so I was nearly sweating before I had my first sip of water.  I went with the Tuscan Omelet, which surprisingly was a little bland. The ciabatta toast, however, was fantastic and the fruit was fresh. My wife's eggs were poached perfectly and her raisin toast was great, as well. She only had a minor complaint in that the side of fruit, while good, wasn't that large. They were busy enough that they had a busboy dedicated to filling people's drinks, so we never wanted for more coffee or water.  Since our first visit was so great, I will chalk this one up to just a bad day at the office. We will definitely be back I am sure, if for nothing else at least to order their ciabatta toast again."}
{"text":"Excellent Eggs Benny! This place is family run and the have specials everyday. The free mimosa was a nice bonus as well (I believe this is only on Sundays). My husband had a chorizo omelet that was made perfectly. We also loved the hotcakes!   We got there at 8:30 (also a nice bonus that they open early on weekends) and parking is free and easy.   It was so much fun to find a new breakfast place --I love Pamela's, but it was fun to switch it up and visit cute Sharpsburg. They are located really close to Bona Terra (another gem that I'd like to try)."}
{"text":"This was a great breakfast stop.  My husband and I love trying new breakfast places and we decided this would be one of our go to breakfast place when friends come to visit.  I had a tuscan omelet frim the special weekend menu which was delicious.  My husband had a Norwegian eggs benedict with salmon and he loved it. We're definitely going back and would recommend it for any breakfast foodie."}
{"text":"Cute little place, will gladly come back again.  Had the Norwegian Benedict and it was wonderful!  Hubby's western omelette was huge and perfect.  My son enjoyed the blueberry pancakes. They offer complementary mimosas today (although they seemed to lack any kick. Had to compare to my son's OJ to see if there was a difference).  Owner's father is there on Sundays and makes the visit a treat. Otherwise service would have dropped the rating down a bit. Our server seemed a bit unhappy)."}
{"text":"Consistently my favorite breakfast place in the area. The omelette specials always taste fresh and the old standbys are expertly prepared. Friendly service and very fair prices as well!"}
{"text":"Off the chart great breakfast place. Meat lovers omelet was superb and cooked just right. The ciabatta toast was awesome and toasted perfectly. The potatoes were honestly the best breakfast potatoes I've had in the city .I loved the spices and texture of them. Coffee was really good as well. Everyone working there was very attentive and super friendly. Would definitely go back again. The specials listed all sounded great. Will go back to try the place for lunch somerime."}
{"text":"J and I came here a few weekends ago for Sunday brunch. Easy parking on the main road on a Sunday which is always good. The wait was 20 minutes, so we put our names in and told the manager that we were going to take a walk. The manager said that he would note that and try to not skip us if we were back in 20 minutes. Not a lot of places will do this, so we were pretty impressed. We came back from our walk and were seated within 5 minutes. The room was pretty damn hot, to be honest. There weren't a lot of people in there, so the air conditioning was possibly not working. Which, on a humid Sunday morning, felt pretty muggy. Our waitress was an older woman who was pleasant, however we felt a bit rushed. She seemed annoyed that we weren't ready to order yet and came back twice in less than 7 minutes. J ordered his normal eggs, bacon, toast, and home fries. I ordered an omelet with tomatoes, cheese, and broccoli. Both came with ciabatta bread which was a nice surprise and pretty good. We also received complimentary mimosas which made my day! The food overall was pretty good and the manager was nice, which made our overall experience a 3/5."}
