{"text":"Oh My God the food is awful. I have it sitting in front of me right now and I cannot take another bite.  Why does the chicken shawarma taste like fish? and the combo doesn't say the chicken shawarmas are wraps and not plates. You would think $22 for two sharwarma combos would mean they are plates and not simply wraps? guess I was wrong.  Fries are freezer burned or something, they taste awful and we're not expecting much when we order take out"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone, I don't think 'Sam' really knows how to make a good wrap. The chicken was greasy gross, 2 small pieces of lettuce and dog-grade beef (which had chunks of falafel to fill in where there wasn't much beef) did a 2 sec grill & done.
I'll never go there again & I don't care that 'Sam' is back because his food sucks.
Cheers."}
{"text":"Casual and friendly establishment in Kensington with delicious food.  Really enjoyed my falafel plate!  Sam makes everything from scratch (except the desserts which he gets from a local bakery) and it's all healthy and yummy!"}
{"text":"Honestly, some of the best shawarma you'll find in the city. Owners are present and friendly and take pride in their food. Chicken melts in your mouth! Price is what you pay for. Worth it."}
{"text":"Overpriced, owner forces you to buy drinks by making the food spicy"}
{"text":"I had Sam's Sandwich (veggie) and it was delicious! Spicy but not overpowering, warm from the grill. The owner is very friendly and personable, which is great to see in the service business. He offered a sample when we first stepped in and treated us well. As for price- not sure what people mean by overpriced, it's standard for Calgary. I would go back again."}
{"text":"the food wasn't bad- but what a rip off.  My son and husband ordered the shawarma wrap for 9.50 and then they charged and extra $3 each for a smear of hummus and a tablespoon's worth of salad.  they did not mention that they were extra- they just said do you want this?  they said yes thinking it was included but it wasn't!  In the end their two raps totaled $27.00- a bit much for fast food."}
{"text":"In my quest to find some decent falafel in the Kensington area, I chose the Shawarma Station as todays stop. Upon entering, I was greeted by a friendly lady cashier and Sam, whose return from Lebanon has prompted a 10% off sale. I ordered a falafel wrap and was immediately asked if I wanted any paid extras ( I declined all). One thing I immediately noticed was intense inventory control that was executed by Sam.  He has making these wraps down to a science and does not give any more than the customer has paid for.  I was offered samples of beef and chicken which I accepted although this seemed a touch on the presumptuous side since I hadn't been to the shop before and I could have very well been a vegetarian.  To be honest, I wasn't overly impressed by the flavour and the texture of either sample.  While both Sam and the cashier were friendly enough, the \"My friend\" post fixing of every statement made by Sam got old fast.  The wrap was tasty enough but it just lacked the amount of necessary ingredients to be a filling lunch.  In terms of value, this place just does not cut it, especially compared to local competitors like Pepinos or Tenshi Sushi.  My search for the ultimate Falafel continues in the Kensington area continues.  Next stop might have to be Jimmys A and A Deli"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma is tasty. The Sam's sandwich with eggplant and falafel is OK. Service is friendly and fast. I will come back."}
{"text":"Easily one of my top 3 Shawarma places in Calgary. I usually eat here once a month. 

I love spicy food, so he makes it nice and hot for me, be careful if you're asking for it spicy! I can understand some people may think it's overpriced, especially if you're asking for an XL, but the best places in Calgary are all roughly that price. 

The owner Sam is extremely personable and outgoing and will more than likely give you a free sample of some of the meat."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious had the falafel wrap and the beef shawarma, and they have the best garlic sauce I've ever eaten"}
{"text":"This is a great joint if you're out late, and in a desperate search to satisfy your munchy. You won't be disappointed by their portions at all.

I'm guilty for loving shawarma mostly for the sweet garlic sauce, which is why I was disappointed with my experience here. The sauce wasn't very creamy or flavorful. I am at fault for not asking for extra, but my usual experience is that they automatically load it on. 

I'll likely gravitate back again for that late night out."}
{"text":"WOW, every time I come here I end up scraping my plate clean! The chicken shawarma plate is fantastic--make sure you try their spicy house sauce. I ordered this twice now, and loved everything about it. The first time I ordered the regular-sized plate, but subsequent times it had to be the large plate--their meat and rice is so well-spiced and presented!

I've had the lamb, too, and it was juicy, tender, perfectly spiced, and with enough salad and pickles to make me happy and well-fed.

The staff are very helpful and attentive, and they are quick and efficient at creating their amazing plates of food. I've never order take-out or delivery, nor have I ever ordered their wraps, so I can't comment on those, but it you want amazing shawarma platters to eat in their nice restaurant, this is a place I heartily recommend."}
{"text":"I really like the shawarmas here; they have plenty of meat, tasty sauce, and are well toasted. The owner is also very friendly. I have to give it 3 stars, however, because the food here is overpriced (depending on what you order it can easily hit $10 for a shawarma). The owner would need to cut the price by 20% to make it good value for money."}
{"text":"Yesterday I wanted a sandwich, so my boyfriend suggested we walk over to Shawarma Station. I was a bit apprehensive walking in because someone had told me some time back that the guy had tried to charge her an extra 2 or 3 bucks for a teaspoon of hummus. 

Anyway, I still went to check it out. While walking in, there was a 'Sam is back!' sign at the door, and upon entering, there was a huge blown up article about 'Sam's magic fingers' on the wall. I'm talking gigantic, like life-size. It was a bit 'Woah' for me. This was Sam overload, and I hadn't even met the guy yet. It had been a whole 5 seconds of me looking at the menu on the wall when this 'Sam' appeared and started asking us what we want, and when I wasnt sure, he started offering little samples of his meat. All well and good, because his samples were very tasty, but I hardly had a quiet moment to think of what I wanted to order because he kept going on and on about how his meat was the best in town and that we should try the mixed shawarma. He kept referring to us as 'my friend' and kept saying \"anything you want my friend, anything you want' and 'thank you very much my friend, thank you very much.' It was a bit too much even for me. Way too overbearing. 

We caved in and ordered 2 mixed shawarma plates, and 2 drinks. While making the plate, he kept asking if I want olives, if I want hummus, if I want tomatoes, etc etc. I kept saying, yes, yes, no, etc. In the end I had a plate with a little bit of salad, a little bit of hummus and a fair amount of meat. The 2 plates with 2 drinks came to $31.50. I was a bit shocked to say the least. My bad, for not asking the breakdown of all the costs? Because this was a bit ridiculous. 

Maybe this is not Montreal, but back there when I went to a shawarma place, I used to get plates piled high with salad, meat, and DELICIOUS garlic potatoes AND a pita for about 9 or 10 bucks maximum. This time, no garlic potatoes, no pita bread. And it was over 13 bucks for each plate. Did they charge me $3 for the hummus? Maybe I should have asked. But I shouldn't have to. The guy should INFORM me if something he is putting on my plate is going to cost me extra. 

The meat was tasty, but the whole deal was ridiculously overpriced. I would not go back again to pay $15 a person for a random fast-food/sandwich/shawarma craving. And Sam should really tone it down a little."}
{"text":"I like this place. Sam is friendly and kind (could be overbearing to some I suppose, but I like him!), the food is tasty and I find the portion size to be perfect. The grill press really helps make a pita wrap great, and the sauces are really good. 

Be careful of the spice - I ask of a 'little bit' spicy, and that is almost too spicy (and I'm not sensitive!). Overall a good expertise, but I do wish my warp was $1 - $2 cheaper; that would make the Station a destination... not just a 'oh I need lunch and I'm in Kensington' stop."}
{"text":"This was my last stop in Calgary. It's a small place, but the lines go out the door. Plates, shawarma, you can't go wrong with anything here. I had the chicken and beef shawarma. A medium is pretty big, good for sharing so you can save room for samosas and baklava. The shawarma wrap had tons of flavor, fresh veggies, grilled carved meat and best of all a grilled wrap. The grilled wrap kept it from getting soggy too quickly with all the juices and sauces. The chicken samosa was delicious. The chicken was flavored well and was shredded. It's too bad it's not freshly fried for the extra crunch. They warmed it up in the microwave . . . may be a better idea to put it on the grill press instead. I didn't get a chance to try the baklava, but they looked really good and it was the perfect bite. I intended to get some after I was done, but he line got way too long."}
{"text":"The food was delicious !!! Had the kefta wrap and my bf got the lamb shawarma and it was delicious she was so kind and even threw in onion rings and baklava ! Great service defintley coming back"}
{"text":"My go-to shawarma delivery place. Cheap, very generous portions and they always pack a few extra items for you. Sometimes I get an extra pistachio dessert and other times I get a few extra falafel balls. 
The shawarma sandwich could use a bit more garlic sauce but it's big and the meat is juicy. 
What I love about the Shawarma Station is that they have Ayran available: a salty yoghurt drink common in the Middle East. I usually order 5 or so with my order to keep handy at home."}
{"text":"While the owner is a lovely gentleman, the food there is ridiculously overpriced."}
{"text":"I walked in here in the middle of a sunny day stroll for a meal and ended up paying for a meal but instead got a snack. The guy at the counter was friendly enough to let me try a piece of beef shawarma, which made no sense because it was right after I had ordered it! So as he jazzed me up with his \"how do you do\"s I noticed he was lightly packing my shawarma. I don't know if this is the norm but for the large sized bread I barely got any veggies, sauce, and meat. Seriously I could have walked McDicks and ordered a snack wrap instead. Or I could have walked the extra 3 blocks to Falafel City!

Worse yet this tiny palm sized wrap came to 9 bucks. 9 BUCKS! Sabz and Thomas said it, this place stiffs you in the ribs, especially if your ribs were a roll of quarters. See? I've been stiffed so badly I'm barely making any sense. And I barely made sense before I walked into this place, so thank you for snowballing the delirium SHAWARMA STATION.

This place almost dampened my pleasant Kensington stroll. YOU DON'T MESS WITH MY STROLLS! Luckily I ran into an old friends who introduced me to some pretty friends and the day was salvaged."}
{"text":"The beef shawarma is one of the best I've ever had! I'm so glad that I stumbled upon this spot. The service was excellent and super friendly. The place was clean and in an awesome location. I'm definitely glad to have tried this place out!"}
{"text":"There is no better Shawarma in Calgary.
The secret recipe of Sam is the golden price of Kensington. There are 5 things this place has that no other shawarma in the city, NO, the country, has.
1. Tabouli
2. Tahiti 
3. Sam's secret chicken herbs
4. Sweet & Sour sauce 
5. The fact that they toast the shawarma in such a way it makes all other shawarma feel shameful. 
I'm not kidding, I will only eat at the shawarma station because for the past 10 years my heart has been shawarmad by Sam. 
I recommend the regular chicken shawarma with EVERYTHING on it. 
-Ben"}
{"text":"Excellent spot for a Shawarma in Kensington. My kids and I love to go here! They think it has the best chicken and rice for Shawarma spots in Calgary. Clean, friendly and fast. Good selection of sauces as well. Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Friendly people, they also gave us free ice creams :)! the food is a bit pricey but tastes good."}
{"text":"Just ordered a chicken shawarma and it was delicious.  :)  

It was a OK in size.  
The flavours were good.  
Spicy was spicy. 

Even though they were busy they were quick and efficient.  She even remembered to cut mine in half. 

The wrap is thin and crispy.  

I'm surprised with the low reviews and thought I'd wrote a more recent review."}
{"text":"After the raw chocolate event, Michelle and I were hungeeee.  Michelle spotted a shawarma place while walking to the event so we decided to make a stop at the shawarma station. 

It was about 9:10PM on a Thursday night, we were the only customers.  We were immediately greeted by the friendly man and women at the front and asked if we've ever been.  I haven't so they offered samples before I decided what to order.  The beef and chicken were fresh off the skewers and wow were they ever tasty!  I really enjoyed the beef because it had a hit of heat and the chicken was super flavorful.  
We both decided to go with a mixed platter which is a mix of beef and chicken that comes with rice, salad, hummus and garlic sauce. Sweet sauce was poured over as well.  We ate in but asked for them to be in takeout containers just in case we couldn't finish.  Like I said above, we were hungeeeee so we sat down and dug in.  I mixed everything together, yes everything.  The rice, with the salad, the meats and the garlic sauce all together.  MMMMMMMMMMMM!!!! I ate the whole container + some of Michelles beef because it got too spicy for her (baby).  Michelle really enjoyed everything though.  The combination on the platter was delightful, the garlic sauce was sweeter than other places I've tried but nonetheless super tasty.  The meats were cooked to perfection with the beef having a slight crisp to it.  Next time I'll ask for more sweet sauce, NOM.

Craving shawarmas and in the Kensington area?  Shawarma station is the place to stop!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and sub-par. 

This place is a pass. Visiting Calgary, I thought I'd pop in for a shwarma. First thing I noticed is that there was nothing on the spinners, as you would expect to see in a shwarma joint. I asked if the meat they were serving was from yesterday and the owner got very indignant and insisted that they come in at 6 am to cook the meat. I should have known this was BS, but I ordered a shwarma plate anyway. It was tiny, not fresh tasting, and like 12 bucks. They didn't even give me pita with it, though to be fair when I asked for some they gave me some stale pita, making a big deal about how it was on the house for me since I was visiting from out of town. He sort of implied that because I was from Vancouver I wouldn't really know much about Shwarma since we don't really have it there, which I thought was pretty funny. 

Anyway, the owner is pushy and overbearing, the food is meh, and way overpriced. My girlfriend had a similar experience. Should have asked her about the place before trying it."}
{"text":"Love this place for its excellent, super fresh and giant falafel wraps. It's been reliable for years. Latest visit, I got a Sam Sandwich, adding eggplant to a falafel wrap and it did not disappoint. It gets busy during weekday lunches, which is always a good sign. Best falafel in Kensington!"}
