{"text":"I'm a fan of Rachel's.  Like another yelper said- Vegas needs way more places like this!  It's a gourmet little breakfast and lunch spot, you order at the counter and there are some cute tables in and outside.  They have breakfast burritos, pancakes, sandwiches, wraps, burgers (beef, chicken), soups, pastas, and huge salads (spinach, curry chicken, cobb).  There is a nice selection of veg options and everything is fresh and high quality.  Pastries could be much improved on and I wish they served breakfast past 11 on weekends.  Mad props for having fresh brewed tropical unsweetened iced tea."}
{"text":"The service & food is always phenomenal. Thank you so much! I love coming here with my friends for a good meal."}
{"text":"I love Rachel's Kitchen! The atmosphere is very relaxed with an upscale feel. The service is fast and effiecient. I love the chicken caesar wrap, the 440 sandwhich and the onion rings are seriously amazing... Cooked to perfection everytime. 
The breakfast here is also very good. I had \"the favorite\". It consists of three eggs scrambled with goat cheese, sundried tomatoes, avacado, mushrooms and basil. The breakfast is served with breakfast potatoes and toast. 
I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone as I always do."}
{"text":"Went there today for a gluten-free lunch. Had the signature pasta with quinoa pasta and chicken it was awesome!!  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The juice bar was just what I needed after a great Vegas night! Invigorating and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to cater office lunch from. The food is delicious, fresh and healthy!"}
{"text":"I work close to this location and everyone is incredibly friendly! They always remember my name. I also have a few allergies, and they always get my order right. The one time it was not right, they drove to my house and delivered a new one. No charge. 
Besides that, it's very clean. Including the restrooms. I would definitely recommend going to this location."}
{"text":"Disappointed - Everyone makes a mistake at some point.  The way that mistake is handled sets the average apart from the exceptional.  Rachel's handled the mistake in an average fashion.  

We ordered an Acai Bowl, Fruit Bowl, Protein Scramble, coffee, and orange juice.  We sat and waited.  Then the Scramble was brought out.  The server asked if we needed anything else and we said, \"We are still waiting for the fruit and Acai.\"

A few minutes later, fruit was brought out.  Then we asked for the Acai.  She asked who took our order, we told her, and she left.  A few more minutes later she returns to tell us the Acai Bowl was not ordered and that I would need to come in to pay for it.

Upon ordering the Acai, I had to ask for a discount or some gesture for the inconvenience. She said, \"We don't offer discounts.\"  I know differently, but I just went along with it.  

Then it hit me:  I just paid $30 (and have been paying that much) for a simple breakfast at a place I've been coming to for quite some time.  And, they don't value my patronage.  So, not only will I find another breakfast place, I will no longer order their catering for my office lunches, and I will be sure to let my friends (and Yelp) know that this is not a place worthy of their patronage.

Note to the reader: while I read reviews on yelp all the time, this is the first time I have ever been compelled to write a negative review. That aught to say something..."}
{"text":"Myself and the crew from the Downtown Podcast had a delicious brunch at this convenient location.  All of the healthy menu options were the perfect balance to my mimosa. Kathy was such a great host and the service is great! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you live or work by Rachel's Kitchen you know it's a good to place for a fast healthy alternative.  Breakfast or lunch the food is fresh and delicious.  The atmosphere is simple, but it works.  The place is small in size and it's clear by the outdoor patio style tables & chairs they have indoors that they try to turn tables quickly.  Still, it is a great place to meet up with friends.  My favorites: the Wilshire smoothie, breakfast burrito, BBQ Chicken Wrap, and Tuna Salad.  If you are on this side of town looking for a place to eat, Rachel's Kitchen is great food serviced quickly."}
{"text":"Love having a Rachel's Kitchen in the neighborhood.  Service is top-notch and you can't go wrong with their curry chicken salad or the scrambled eggs with tomato & basil for those rough mornings.  ;)"}
{"text":"Nice clean place with outside seating, strong selection overall. A perfect lunchtime spot. A bit pricey but that's to be expected. Will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place . Their chicken fettucini is the best ever , I also love their smoothie . They give generous portions and its at a fair price . Not to mention , its healthy too . Their staff is awesome and very welcoming."}
{"text":"This location has been my go-to lunch spot for the past four days!  LOVE the convenient location just inside the Cleveland Clinic, delectable menu choices, and Rachel's always-friendly staff.  This is the way fast food should be!"}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is a lovely place to eat & enjoy a glass of wine! Great food in a casual environment."}
{"text":"My third visit here. It's expensive and the food is subpar to par! First two to-go orders tasted alright - breakfast burrito (sub par) on the first visit and then the breakfast wrap (par) on the second visit. This morning, I invited my daughter for brunch. As we were already enjoying our food (she ordered the chicken caesar salad, which she would've liked a lot if only they didn't put too much cheese in the salad), I found a short strand of hair in my food (I ordered The Favorite)! I'm not a stickler when it comes to stuff like that (I choose my battles in life!). I took it out and kept going and didn't even say anything to my daughter; and then my daughter's eyes got bigger, made a big \"woah\" and goes, \"Mom!!!! Look!!!!\" So, there she pulls out a short strand of hair out of her salad! Oh heck, I thought! Two strikes! I called one of the servers and told him what we just found. He asked my daughter if she wanted new salad, but by then, she already lost her appetite. The server just said sorry, and walked away. My daughter and I thought he could've just offered to credit our food or he could've given us a voucher.... something... We had to be home at a certain time, that we couldn't really stay at the place another minute, so we decided to just pack up. Needless to say, I felt JIPPED paying almost $35.00 for two meals and finding hair strands in both orders! Oh, and one more thing, the coffee beans in the coffee were not fully grounded! There were particles of ground coffee beans in my cup. Side note: when you order and pay upfront, you're automatically asked (by their computer cash register) to tip..."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Crowded, but so tasty. I had the BBQ bacon burger and the sweet green juice. Such a nice change from your run of the mill chain restaurant. A lot of reviews have commented on the fact that the burgers are only cooked medium or medium well, as a medium rare lover myself, I really didn't notice a difference. Somewhat pricey but you get what you pay for. If you want greasy and cheap, this is not the place you are looking for."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Had a BerryMania and you can tell how packed it was with fruits. Amazing service too!"}
{"text":"You have to make sure you stop at Rachel's Kitchen in Centennial Hills!! Excellent and healthy food! We love the turkey burger with sweet potato fries!! Stop in for a refreshing smoothie or an amazing brunch on the weekend!! Love the staff here!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but then I had some 2 bad experiences. 
 The first time I got a take out and when I got home I (about 15 min later) I opened the food box and my bread was wet.  When I say wet I mean wet like soaked- ughhh.

Since I had great experience in the past, I went again and this time I got  food poisoning and spend the whole day in the bathroom-double ughh. 

I must say one great thing about them is their juices and coffees I would stay away from their food though."}
{"text":"True disappointment. Bland food and long wait for it. The service was the only positive part."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday, Sunday for the first time w/friends. Ordering of food was easy & food was good overall. Potatoes came out cold & waitress thought our friend was kidding about getting new hot batch. She did oblige. My husband & I each ordered a meal & water; came to $27 which was quite pricey. May go back but no gua"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food . Great quality for the price . They catered our holiday brunch and were amazing . They worked with our budget and were so helpful and friendly . Everyone loved the food . Can't say enough about their service ."}
{"text":"I ordered to-go service from Rachel's Kitchen and I couldn't be more impressed!

The menu selection is great, offers everything from all veggie smoothies to a chicken sandwich. I opted for a tuna salad sandwich and a side salad. The food came still tasting fresh even though it had been driven about 5 miles from the store. The packaging was great and the food was still cold! 

If you're looking for somewhere with healthy options I would definitely go for Rachel's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in here for a smoothie, Vincent and Dakota were very cordial and welcomed me into the establishment. Smoothie was made quickly and was very good. Will return for seconds! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"You walk in and immediately smell cheap burned oil from the grill. Thought it was just a whoops that first time in the morning but no.  Every time we've been there. Would never order something cooked on that grill. They make great smoothies and coffee. Have to go to the patio due to the smell. Very unexpected due to their \"healthy\" focus. Staff great."}
{"text":"We had to wait to order until the girls (one short girl and the other with tattoo's) at the counter were finished with their conversation, no smile not even decent customer service - these people should not work near customers. They gave no help with what was good or what they would suggest just blank looks like my family was bothering them. We order breakfast burritos, oatmeal and french toast. The breakfast burritos were cold the actual tortilla felt as cold as the eggs, the oatmeal was dryed out however the french toast was delicious. No one came around to ask how the food was or if we or anyone else needed anything, again those two girls and one blonde only talked to each other never the customers. Do they not know that customer service can make or break an establishment?
Dirty tables that were not cleaned and the floor was never swept - we noticed this since it took close to 30 mins to get our food. Other customers were commenting on the 'piss poor service' as one gentleman said and another couple said 'how could these girls pass an interview'.
The food is lacking taste/flavor but even worse is the terrible staff. Maybe we will try a different Rachel's Kitchen location because this one is poorly managed and most likely won't be around very long. So disappointing since it was close to our house.
Guess I should have checked the reviews first."}
{"text":"About a month ago visiting me and my sisters went to get smoothies and this was the closest place on Fremont besides getting alcohol. Anyways I ordered 3 smoothies, my sister got a peanut butter smoothie and it was disgusting so we wanted to exchange it. The manager, can't remember her name but she gave us a $3 discount off instead of just exchanging it for free. So I still came out of pocket $5 for another smoothie. Because of that I will never be visiting that place again, overpriced $6/$7 for a smoothie. Might as well go to Jamba Juice and pay the same price for a quality smoothie with great customer service! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AT RACHEL'S KITCHEN!"}
{"text":"Good place to go and eat healthy! I went there and I ordered a hamburger. The portion is good, I was full by the time I got done with burger. The price is a little steep but it was well worth the burger.  The place is nice clean the customer service was great. I will return fora good healthy burger again."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I came here for breakfast with my girlfriend and her kids. The food is great! Try the acai bowl or the breakfast burrito. As great as the food was, the service was even better! They made us feel so special. Thank you Rachel's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love good coffee! 
Just discovered recently how great is the cappuccino here. Definitely like caramel  flavored coffee. 
So, when you decide whether to get only coffee or something else too, this is the perfect place to try. It's located in the beautiful Downtown of Las Vegas.
Besides coffee, there are many different pastries and various entrees to choose from.
After entering into the restaurant, you get in the line to the cashiers, where the drinks and meals can be ordered, and paid for. Afterward, the cashier gives you a number, what you place on your chosen table, where you will be served by waiters or waitresses.
Pretty easy process!
I visited Rachels twice last week, while I was doing business in the Area.
Both times I ordered a Cappuccino (large) and Chocolate Cookie (warmed up), and my friend ordered a Grilled chicken  Salad. 
According to my friend, the salad wasn't too bad, but unfortunately not very good either.
I absolutely loved the cappuccino and the cookie! 
I'm sure I will be back to try other items from the menu! And of course to enjoy the amazing coffee"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were exploring the Summerlin ArtWalk at The Trails Center and was approached by a Rachel's Kitchen employee. She handed each of us a menu and welcomed us to check them out for their grand opening across the street.

While browsing through the art, we read through the menu, looking through all their salads, pasta, wraps, sandwiches, and burgers. Their menu also includes a breakfast menu served all day, a kids menu for the little ones, along with a lighter menu for the calorie-conscious. Dunno about my coworkers, but I was hungry and won over by the sweet potato fries or onion rings. We decided to head over.

Situated right next to Kumon, the restaurant is well-lit and is bigger than it appears from the outside. You can order at the counter and they'll assign you a number so someone can bring your food to your table. The dining area is spacious, although the drink station is a bit hidden at the back. Their service is quite friendly and efficient too.

I had the cheeseburger with the 1/3-pound patty done medium. When I picked the burger up, it was practically dripping its juices onto my plate. Their sweet potato fries were made well, not too thick and still crisp. Yum. I really like that they have clean, healthy dishes that have this fresh vibe to them.

Might have to come by for a smoothie or one of their freshly squeezed juices sometime! It's a nice place to grab a typical breakfast, lunch, or brunch."}
{"text":"Delish! Enjoyed catering from Rachel's during our retreat with The Mill. The salads were so fresh :)"}
{"text":"A favorite Summerlin spot for breakfast, lunch, or (takeout) dinner.

Ready in 15 minutes: Favorites are the Signature Pasta or the Mac and Cheese (with mushrooms and onions).  All the breakfast items are excellent.

Tip: If Pecan Bars are in stock, treat yourself. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"I work not too far from this Rachel's Kitchen. Our office usually orders from here once a week, if not more. They do deliver which makes things a lot easier on us. When I do go in to either pick up take out or sit down, everyone there greets you as you walk in and are extremely nice. 

The food at Rachel's always tastes so fresh. Which i love. I'm also vegan and they have a really good veggie wrap and salad i'm able to order. The fresh juices are to die for, especially on a hot day when you don't feel like eating too much. 

The food does take a while to get out, but it's worth the wait in my opinion. They also have a nice breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, free WiFi, plenty of indoor/outdoor seating, healthy food, and it's delicious!!!  What more can you want?"}
{"text":"A few days ago we tried Rachel's as we are new to town. This place was a joke. Way too expensive for what you get. They have packed so many tables into this tiny space that it is awkward to just stand in line to order your food. We took our food to go because it was just too claustrophobic in there. When we get home there was no dressing for my salad, basically just a pile of chopped broccoli and my husbands wrap was no better. All of the chicken on the wrap was on one side. Just careless service and expensive prices. Very disappointed as it is hard to find healthy food around here."}
{"text":"Great spot in terminal 1 if you're looking for healthy juice, smoothies and snacks post Vegas binder."}
{"text":"I usually order Signature Pasta, generous portions. I've tried their fruit order and it was ripe and fresh. Long story short, it's a great place to eat fresh and flavorful meals. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I eat here at least a couple times a week. I love the healthy options and as a vegetarian I don't have any problems finding things to eat! My go-to choices are the Garden burger, sweet potato fries (so yum), acai berry smoothie and the signature salad. Oh! And the grilled cheese is heaven. Everyone there is always so pleasant. I call in my order the majority of time and my food is always ready when they say it will be. :)"}
{"text":"My Wife and Myself love this place! Great menu, service is excellent, tasty food and juices. A big plus is they deliver, although we sat in their dining room which was clean and inviting. 
What a refreshing little oasis in this mad city!"}
{"text":"Great fresh tasting food with some unique menu items.  I love this place but it is an expensive lunch spot.  My only issue is I wish I could afford to come here more often."}
{"text":"The food is good and healthy.  The chicken and barley soup was our favorite along with the teas.  They provide nice healthy portions and the wait staff was really nice.  The only downer is the place is really small and it's tough to find a seat."}
{"text":"Food was good, environment and staff were friendly - expected a little more for what I paid for but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"The food was very average, and pretty expensive. I got the mushroom cheeseburger with avocado, and my wife got a salad. Together our meal came to about $37 dollars. Neither large or small portions. Everything was just average. My wife's salad was nothing but stem from iceberg lettuce with a small portion of chicken and large amounts of cheese. The presentation and actual consistency in food was very poor. Customer service was great though! I'm giving two stars because of the over priced, average food."}
{"text":"Found this place when we just weren't in the mood for a bar breakfast. Great vibe and the employees make you feel welcomed.  PROTEIN LOVERS SCRAMBLE WAS AWESOME. Get fresh juice, a little pricey but well worth it.  Breakfast burrito was good, but a bit lacking in the fillings; ill try the breakfast wrap next time."}
{"text":"So I'm in vegas again for Chinese New Year with some friends and we stopped by Rachels kitchen for lunch.  We had french toast, grilled chicken sandwich and signature salad.  They were all delicious.  I don't mind at all to pay a little bit more to get healthy fresh and delicious food.  One thing that I should try next time I'm coming back here is juices."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Rachel's Kitchen with a great staff and amazing good. Special thanks to Efren for the great customer service!"}
{"text":"A great find! We loved The Favorite and the customizable omelet made to order. The ambiance is nice and food is pretty great as well. Portions were perfect for 3. Will come again!"}
{"text":"I love Rachel's Kitchen. My expectations were high from other experiences and this location doesn't disappoint.  The food is good and wholesome,  service is super friendly and fast. The atmosphere is nice,  especially when the weather allows us to sit on the patio. The only down sides are that the patio is in a parking lot and it's not as budget-friendly as I'd like. I get past it and go anyway. I guess I'm a happy regular."}
{"text":"Love Rachel's Kitchen! Not sure who Rachel is ;) but Caron & Kathy are the best partners I could ask for when it comes to catering orders. Thank you guys! 

Also, my personal favorite is the BBQ Chicken Wrap with sweet potato fries. Anyone out there that is not sure what to order... can't go wrong with this wrap. 

-Jeffa :)"}
{"text":"Our first time here, nice outdoor ambiance for weekend breakfast. I had \"the favorites\" and my husband had scrambled eggs with cheese and a side of bacon & avocados. You can't really screw up breakfast but they did. I was having dry scrambled eggs without seasoning or salt in it, and my husband had 2 burned bacons and very dry scrambled eggs with cheese. I'm not coming back here for breakfast again. Their customer service however, is ok, otherwise I'd give it a 1 star."}
{"text":"Good location. Easy to find. Staff is friendly and helpful. Knowledgeable about their menu. I like the unlimited fountain drink refills and that they offer vitamin water, not just sodas. 

First time I went, I had a smoothie only and it was pretty good. This time I thought I'd try a salad since I was there for a lunch meeting. But I was disappointed. 

If I were reviewing just the food, we'd be looking at 2 stars. I added the third because of the good points I mentioned above.

I ordered the Grilled Vegetable and chicken salad. The menu described my salad deliciously, but what came out really seemed like leftovers thrown together haphazardly with cross contamination from another salad I'm sure they mixed in the same bowl earlier. The menu on their website listed all of the ingredients, but I found items that weren't included in the menu description. Either the menu is incorrect, or the salad was mixed in the same bowl, or someone in the back made a mistake. 

The other issue I had was that the salad wasn't actually mixed well. I had been eating it for about 10 minutes before I found the zucchini and eggplant at the very bottom. By then I didn't want to eat it, because they didn't look appetizing.

The grilled vegetables were cold and limp, hence my suspicion that it was leftovers. The chicken tasted like it had been cooked and chilled the day before, as did the grilled veggies. The whole salad was bland, and there was barely any salad dressing at all. And again, the occasional stray item that wasn't supposed to be in the salad popped up every once in awhile.

I left most of the salad on the table when I left. I barely ate any of it. Shame, because it was a very large portion. But it just wasn't worth it. I came home and I'm making my own lunch.

Bottom line: I felt like I was eating a salad at a fast food establishment, not a mom and pop small, locally owned business."}
{"text":"Yes, this review is a novel  but I am beside myself! I've been to this location a few times because my youngest daughter loves their smoothies, but the service is always very nonchalant, bordering rude. My daughter's and I visited yesterday and ordered 3 of the same type of smoothie. Immediately after we tasted them we all remarked that there were a lot of seeds this time but didn't really think anything of it. A few sips later I got what seemed far too large and flat to be a seed and unfortunately , I was correct.  All 3 smoothies were FULL of small pieces of stiff plastic!!! I had both girls check theirs as I did mine to make sure before I went back and it was unbelievable. Of course I went back.  I showed the manager on duty several pieces of plastic inside of each cup and her brilliant  response was and I quote , \" Oh, it must be coming off of the cups.\"  Not once did she or the very unfriendly young woman who made the smoothies apologize. She offered to give us more smoothies in the disintegrating cups or a refund. I find it ridiculous that they were not more concerned about serving customers indigestible and dangerous product...unless it was done on purpose. In either case the situation and their response is UNACCEPTABLE ! I will not be back and I suggest anyone wanting a healthy FOOD option visit an establishment that actually serves food...not plastic."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are very good, leaving you with a \"clean\" feel. Deliciously light and satisfying. If you're going to indulge a little, swap the side salad for the fries, onion rings, or the sweet potato fries!

Breakfast is always great too. Who can resist a hearty breakfast burrito. Definitely one of my stables. Thanks Rachel's, you guys are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen. Possbily my favorite cafe I have ever gone to. I bring family & friends here so much we could start our own fan club. From omlettes to sandwhiches, wraps , & pastas you can find something for everyone here. They also do fresh squeezed juices and smoothies which are amazing. My \"go -to's\" are always the Chicken Tender Wrap & the Signature Pasta. I love the \"Incredible Hulk\"  smoothie. My only con would be that you can wait for a while after placing your order. Lunch there is VERY busy. Summerlin moms roll in with their tennis partners, students playing hookie from high schools, &  me.. the fan club. Everything is made fresh to order so be patient because what you get will definitely be worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been a few times and really enjoy going here. I have had the chicken sandwich with goat cheese and peppers, great everytime. I tried the grilled vegetable salad and that was delicious but too healthy for me. I want to come back and try their breakfast, it sounds really good. I also think they have nice people that are working, I have watched impatient people be rude and the workers are always polite so I make sure to tip them. It's hard to find good customer service in this town"}
{"text":"I really enjoy my experience at Rachel's kitchen located on trailwood. The staff is very friendly, helpful and informative. My favorite are the smoothies, wheat grass shots and turkey burgers with sweet potato fries. The ambience is peaceful, artsy and classy rolled into one. It's like walking through an gallery that offers wonderful food and service. It doesn't end there, the patio has a fabulous view of the mountains. You can choose to enjoy breakfast with fresh juice or watch the sunset over the mountains as you enjoy dinner. Rachel's kitchen is a real treat."}
{"text":"We got take out from Rachel's while visiting family in Vegas. The food was super yummy and the service was also good.

We ordered fettuccine Alfredo with mushrooms and spinach and it was terrific. We also ordered 2 salads and one has an amazing caprese basil and balsamic dressing that was to die for.

Cupcakes were pretty good too.

Try them!"}
{"text":"Great fresh meals,juices, and smoothies. To avoid the lunch rush best to go before 11:30. I prefer the sweet greens fresh juice."}
{"text":"Love Rachel's Kitchen and especially this location! The food is always fresh, staff always polite, and ambience always inviting. They are excellent for catering as well. They make ordering easy and delivery and set up are efficient and organized. So many delicious options on the menu...I love Rachel's Chicken Salad and usually get it in a lettuce wrap, which they'll do for any sandwich. It's definitely a spot worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I'm a Rachel's Kitchen fan and I am happy they opened up downtown. We used to frequent the one in Summerlin since we lived there and have always loved the food...especially the breakfast.

Here is what to expect every time you go...
1. Look at menu and have a hard time deciding between the good options.
2. Order is always taken quickly.
3. Find a table and prepare to wait a little more than you think you have to because they are making things fresh in the back. Sometimes this wait gets aggravating.
4. Food comes to the table and you get to enjoy the goods.

That routine is pretty much how it goes every time. I recommend the breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food, good customer service, and love the smoothies!!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"What a waste of $22. Me and my boyfriend decided to go here after seeing reviews on yelp. I got the curry chicken sandwich on wheat bread and he got the Mac n cheese. Let's start with the sandwich. There was so many greens on the sanwhich that I might as well have gotten a salad. It was thrown together and falling apart as soon as I picked it up. There was barely any chicken and most of it fell off when I picked up the sandwich. The fries were your everyday fries and the portion was tiny. The Mac n cheese was terrible. It was too liquidy. It lacked in overall flavor. He ended up throwing half of it away because he honestly couldn't stand it. Like I said before, WHAT A WASTE OF $22. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"WOW. So delicious!! Came here 2x during a 5 day business trip and couldn't get enough! Love the casual atmosphere.  Cobb salad was one of the best I've ever had.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Seriously the nastiest cheeseburger and onion rings I have ever had. Took one bite and threw it out."}
{"text":"On my 2nd trip to Rachel's...I experienced the same problem on my 1st visit....the wait.  The food I love, but the time waiting for a take out order was kinda crazy long.  It seems they are only able to make one order at a time instead of multiple orders at once.  Again, food is good.  But the prep time could use some help."}
{"text":"2nd visit, a bit pricey for 2 turkey club w/fries. Very clean...both visits register staff could use some customer service training not very friendly, guess its better than them being rude."}
{"text":"Good portion size so you may want to share. Breakfast all day. Home style food which is fresh & healthy. Catering available as well. Close to Green Valley Casino if you've had enough of buffets. Wraps, burgers, pastas, smoothies, beer, champagne, mimosas, fresh squeezed juice , sandwiches, salads, & soups what else could you ask for."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas a couple weekends ago, and needed a quick and easy place for dinner, way northwest side of town.  It had to be healthy, and couldn't take forever to get your food.  I really tried to be good, but then my dinner buddy got the chicken fingers.  Of the kids menu.  Two huge whole pieces of chicken, looked like it was breaded and cooked in house, and tasted even better.  (Check out photo.)

Previously, I did have a favorite spot in town for chicken tenders, but now that I saw Rachel's, I have a new fave.

There is another location in Summerlin.  I don't know if they are the same owner.  This one serves beer.

Just a little drafty now that it's winter, so sit along the wall left of the door."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Ordered two ultimate grilled cheese sandwiches to go when I went to eat my dinner, realized they had only given me one grilled cheese and one chicken salad sandwich. Problem is, I'm a vegetarian so I had to drive 20 minutes each way out of my way to get my correct dinner. That's not really what I'm complaining about, I'm really complaining that when I got to the restaurant to tell them, they never offered an apology and when they looked it up on the computer they said oh you were charged for a different sandwich. What difference does that make I want to know? I did not order that"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. The food is just OK though and the service leaves a lot to be desired. 

I get it, it's more of a fast casual concept than a full sit down restaurant but the food moves out at the pace of a sit down without the full service.

We do root for this place because it seems to be a local business."}
{"text":"Cool location and great service!

The house pasta was large. It had penne pasta, chicken, sun-dried tomatoes in a cream sauce. We split that among 2 women and the portions were still decent. Very tasty!

Soup of the day was cream of mushroom soup which came with some bread. Not too crazy about it. Perhaps it can use some more whole chunks of mushroom to give it some texture. Maybe the pairing of the cream of soup with the cream-based house pasta was just too rich.

The employees were friendly, attentive, and helpful."}
{"text":"10 dollars for French Toast that was terrible. How are you going to use Italian bread for French toast?"}
{"text":"Food was ok. From the name to its actual atmosphere was a little bit different...o I don't know what I'm saying...really..so full I can't think!
You gotta go there and taste it for your self!!
The food?? Don't want to be pointing out negatives when review things...because it seems as thought that's what we always dread to hear!
Why so negative???
Yes...the food was good...though I could have cooked the same thing at home...it's what sucks when you gotta rush out in the morning to work with an empty stomach!
But hey...try it!!"}
{"text":"By far this is my favorite local restaurant. I have never had a dish I don't like. The variety is awesome and the food is healthy and delicious - chef Juan really knows what he's doing! Yesenia is always polite, great customer service all around. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"On a Saturday morning, I was looking forward to going to This place. I've always driven past it & it looked like a \"healthy\" choice, considering their menu had wraps, salads & juices- so I finally tried it.

Walked in, ordered food & sat down- hoping my food would be able to satisfy my tastebuds. 
Not. A. Chance.

The food simply was comparable to cafeteria food I was served in high school. I had gotten the chicken curry wrap, which didn't specify it had raisins in it, or that my plate had literally 10 fries on it. 
My friend had gotten the French toast. His first impression was the thick slabs of ciabatta bread just looked like they were toasted & served with ice cold syrup. Of all things, how can you screw up French toast? I digress.


This place needs a good chef & they will survive.
Because, paying $$$ for shitty food, makes me so disappointed in the people behind the scenes of he kitchen. This isn't the first review that this is said.
Just saying."}
{"text":"Rachel's kitchen offers reasonably healthy and tasty meals. The wife loves the sweet potato fries. It is a counter service restaurant where it is normally quick to order but food takes a little time to prepare. They recently got rid of their low calorie menu which is disappointing but you can still be healthy if you pick right."}
{"text":"A quite yummy place to grab some brunch. The bbq chicken wrap was amazing! The penne traditional tomato basil pasta was simply deliciosa. I would definitely recommend this to you pasta lovers out there!"}
{"text":"Nice local place with healthy food options. I like sitting on back patio which has a zen fountain that creates a nice outdoor ambiance. Also a good alternative to the nearby competitor the \"Egg works\" restaurant which can have a solid waiting list, as it did this Sunday morning. I like the espresso bar at Rachel's as well.  I have ordered take out online without issues, everything ready and hot at scheduled pickup time."}
{"text":"We live clear across town but whenever we're in Green Valley we always enjoy a meal & mimosa at Rachel's! The food is always good & service is excellent. This is a hard working staff, the place is always busy yet they remain attentive to their customers!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Had a great first impression by having an employee open the door for me, and very customer friendly for my first time here as I gazed at the menu for 5 minutes.  I was asked if I needed help with a smile.  They were out of sweet potato fries but I didn't mind because everyone was so nice. Delicious chunky  chicken salad sandwich on a French roll.  I will be back again to try out the other smoothies."}
{"text":"I love Rachel's Kitchen. It's the best option if you're looking fr a place to eat at in the district. Their food is always fresh and highly addictive. My go to items are either one of the salads or the \"440 sandwhich\". The staff is always friendly and brings you your order. I've been meaning to try the breakfast because the menu looks delicious. The only minor complaint I have would be it's a little on the pricey side. I know they have really fresh ingredients so I can't complain too much. I still will continue coming here because it's so tasty though!

Also when the weather is nice you can sit outdoors with your dog which is a major plus!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute most favorite lunch spot on earth! The people who work there are amazing and they have excellent customer service! It's always welcoming when they know my order by heart and are always so sweet to my two kids! Hands down the best Rachel's location! Try the signature pasta, BOMB!"}
{"text":"First impresion was that this place was very, very clean. Counter-service restaurant with lots of good sounding juices on the menu, although it is not clear what is in any of them. Four of us ordered breakfast items: omelettes, eggs, fruits, toast, which were good. Went again a second time for salads, which were very ordinary and not at all worth the high prices. Go for breakfast and maybe juice; skip for salads."}
{"text":"Rachel's kitchen is amazing..food is great! Staff is always friendly.. And the patio is great especially with this breezy weather"}
{"text":"The best I can say was everything was just ok. I went for breakfast and ordered granola because everything else just seemed uninspired, nothing to get excited about. That plus a side of turkey bacon and a small fountain drink cost me $13 plus tip. The granola came with vanilla yogurt on top, which the menu did not describe. I was initially upset because I didn't want a parfait, but ultimately I was glad because the granola was so blah. There were a few raisins but other than that it was mostly just toasted oats... Nothing crunchy or even holding it together. My friend ordered Banana chocolate chip pancakes. It was a large serving but she ate less than half because  the bottom two pancakes were overcooked and a bit burned. It was clean and the staff was friendly although a bit slow. We were the only two people there and ordered at the same time,  but her pancakes came out about 15 minutes before my granola. The best thing was that they had unsweetened iced green tea."}
{"text":"Been coming to Rachel's Kitchen for over 7 years... Food is always fresh and the staff is friendly.  I can get in and out on my lunch hour with ease.  I use Rachel's Kitchen to cater events a few times a month, they do a fabulous job.  Try the salads they are delicious..."}
{"text":"Rachel's  Kitchen is a great place to eat and enjoy the beautiful District!  Everything is fresh and most of the people are super friendly...a few times some of the cashiers were a little short and not so friendly.  Overall, solid place to grab a healthy meal!"}
{"text":"First time and last, we are healthy eats and this food is absolutely bad.  Chicken salad sandwich and all it had on it was watery grapes no taste.  I don't mind the price but when I leave feeling they should have paid me to eat it that is not a good thing.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast...ordered the scrambled eggs with tomato and basil with a side of bacon...the bacon came out ice cold. My fiancé ordered the same thing, and he thought it was \"ok\". The smoothie was REALLY good and fresh. The cappuccino was \"meh\", and the cup was only full halfway. Not sure if I will come back :("}
{"text":"As other have said it is expensive for what you're getting, but the food is always outstanding here. Staff is very knowledgable and friendly. The orders do take a while sometimes, but I usually dine in and am not in a hurry. Overall a great place to have a light meal. Just wish it was more reasonably priced so I could go more often!"}
{"text":"The food was good. All was great until I found a pubic hair in my turkey sandwich. NO!!!! Why!!! I'm ruined forever...... Can't go back, maybe for a juice drink"}
{"text":"Please clean up the out side seating :) its still warm outside and i wanted a shaded place to sit but there was all this food and a water cup i personally cleaned up and the space inside gets crowded quickly.. expecially now that theres free wifi ! ;)"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but I could seriously eat here daily. Love the food, and the juices. Customer service could be a little friendlier, but I would still eat here every day if I lived right next door and had endless funds."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is really great! They are healthy & wholesome, as well as tasty & fast! They are a great little place for breakfast, lunch or dinner! They are opening another location soon off Tropicana & Grand Canyon (i think)! Try the burgers, better than you would expect!"}
{"text":"Disappointing!!

My wife and I ordered some burgers today. During check out the guy behind the register was super awkward almost like he got a crush on me or my wife. Anyhow. We ordered some burgers cooked medium. 

After finding a table outside we received our food. First they came with the wrong sides but that was an easy fix. The burger was over cooked (well done) almost dry. The bread was blackened on the bottom bun and the whole thing didn't have flavor. I would have taken the food back and had them make it again but I had to go to work.

The only reason I gave two stars is cuz you can tell the quality they use on there food is good. Now they just need to learn how to make decent food."}
{"text":"This place is so over hyped!  I've been numerous times trying to understand why I hear good things about it and it is incredibly mediocre.  Lacking in flavor and just darn uninspirational.  Plus they have odd ingredient combinations on some of their menu items.  I believe that the only reason that people go there is to show up in their work out clothes, expensive cars and pretend to be eating healthy.  Many people are fooled into believing they are organic and healthy.  They aren't organic and barely healthy.  I think it's also that Vegas outside of the strip lacks any restaurants that feel \"mom and pop-ish\" and they have that going for them I suppose.  I'd save your money and go somewhere else unless you just want to be seen with the \"pretty people\"."}
{"text":"Great place for delicious food and drinks. Healthy to boot! !! Had a great spinach salad.. Vanessa and Justina  were awesome! ! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Vincent Davidson, the manager at the North Durango location, exceeded my expectations today. Vince and Hannah( delivered our food) made sure that I was a happy customer. Thanks Rachel's Kitchen! We love your service and food."}
{"text":"An ok spot with usual breakfast suspects. Nothing we took stand out in any way, but nothing was unpleasant either. Add one star for service. They carry decent oatmeal, this is a plus. Took a greens and vegetables juice which turned out to be mostly cucumber. Place itself is rather uninspiring. Oh, and they don't do eggs sunny side up."}
{"text":"Rachel's food is usually refreshing. I love grabbing a Hawaiian smoothie before a flight. Just avoid the steel cut oats. They are watery and feel like you've been punished with gruel. We went back and asked for something to add in and they wanted to charge $2.50 for a side a fruit even though the guy asked if I wanted berries on it when I ordered. I guess it was an upsale. Smoothie was good at least. As a local I like to support local businesses."}
{"text":"Awesome options. Always a lovely and helpful staff- Yami makes the BEST Americano around!"}
{"text":"I enjoy that they have Gluten Free options. Not many restaurants do. Staff is friendly and food is good. A little  bit expensive for a cafe..."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast the other day, craving eggs and bacon.  I asked for my eggs sunny side up, which they refused to cook.  I was informed my only options are scrambled or medium.  I asked why and they said because of health regulations...gtfo you can get eggs any way you like anywhere in town!

Either they are lazy (perhaps) or their eggs are pre-made (likely)...simply cannot believe you are only allowed to get eggs only those ways, and I don't appreciate being lied to my face as to the reason why either.

Also ordered an iced coffee..do they brew coffee than chill it so you can have it over ice..of course not.  You just get a soda cup, fill it with ice from the soda dispenser and pour hot coffee over it, diluting the coffee completely in the process.  Indicative of the half-*ssed way they approach their business.  There are many fine, or even just average breakfast places in town that will feed you higher quality food for a fairer price.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The front counter people were extremely rude. They showed no enthusiasm whatsoever and were barking orders at me to move out of the way when I was waiting for a to go order. The wait time was almost 45 minutes as I watched other orders get made and stowed under the counter. They were not careful about bagging the order and sauce was everywhere in the bag - probably more in the bag by the time they were done then on the pasta itself. I would look elsewhere to eat and avoid the hassle. There are plenty of better places nearby."}
{"text":"I love Downtown and healthy food so I had to check this out.  Very nice environment.  Service was very fast and friendly.  I had a turkey burger with a side salad.  Burger was perfect.  I will definitely be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Start thinking HEALTHY and TASTY! This Rachel's Kitchen at the Ogden offers a sweet ambiance along with their great food. I can always count on checking the box that I did something good for myself by ordering with health and nutrition in mind. I had an incredible sandwich loaded with fresh grilled vegetables and a wonderful juice with fresh ingredients. The staff are always above and beyond friendly and helpful when selecting my meal.  I have frequented many times and they are always doing something fun for the community - last time they had a guitar playing background music. What a great addition to the downtown area. Try it! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I will never take my business back to Rachel's kitchen. Particularly the one located in the district. As I was trying to order my breakfast the cashier was not only helping me but helping somebody else at the same time. This made him take almost 10 min to just take my order. After waiting another 15 min for my food I walked over to coffee bean, had enough time to talk with some friends I ran into, and then returned and still my food wasn't ready. Finally somebody asked me if I've been helped and I pointed to a to go bag and said I have been waiting for my food and am pretty sure that is mine. The worker told me that was THEIR food. So after waiting a total of 30 minutes they tell me that the hold up was to make themselves food. Finally 5 minutes later I received my order to later notice that half of the bags were torn open at the bottom and leaking. Thanks a lot Rachel's kitchen at the district you will never have my business ever again."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is my go to cafe for a quick salad or sandwich and brunch on the weekends. All the workers are very friendly and the owners Chris and Stacey are always involved. I enjoy the large outdoor patio on nice days. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"They need to invest in trays to serve the food from. Currently they carry your food across the restaurant often with their thumb in your Bowl and they do not wear gloves. The food is good but the staff is not very welcoming or Friendly. It's ok for a quick breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"The food is great n the people are friendly... A little pricy tho but will deff go back!!=]"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying this place and I must say I was very impressed. The place was very clean and looked great. I was greeted with a smile and great customer service. The most important part, my food. It was fantastic. I love the garden pasta. It's a must try if you like pesto. I definitely will be back and I will tell my family and friends what a great place this was."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this restaurant on a Saturday morning. The staff was more than helpful and the breakfast burrito was perfect to split with my friend, as well as being delicious. I ordered an iced coffee that came with milk in it that I had not asked for, but the service more than made up for any shortcoming with coffee. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Don't come here to take your food to go. Walked in and order a salad to go which was pretty promptly made. Next it sat in the window for 10 plus minutes while I waited.  The guy putting together orders was oblivious he had a waiting guest. Finally another employee figured it out. I'll pass on this location next time"}
{"text":"Food is usually good but priced way too high! Can't stand when they let customer eat INSIDE with their pet dogs.!!No not service animals. Seen that at least twice so must be a usual occurrence."}
{"text":"This place is Great! Fresh food, tasty, healthy, what more do you want? :)
Really friendly staff as well ;)

Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I love Rachel's Kitchen. BBQ chicken salad and tuna salad are excellent, especially if you are trying to lay off those carbs. Also, the downtown location is great coffee and meeting spot"}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes for a juice, had to ask for it, who knows how long it was sitting there? And turns out they made the wrong drink. I don't like wasting food so I didn't bother taking it back.  Such a bummer, the food looks good and I like the idea of the place."}
{"text":"We ordered the mushroom burger w/sweet potato fries and off the light menu the veggie wrap w/salad. Also a side of onion rings. Our order was messed up, but that doesn't bother us as long as the food is good. Plus the guy that took our order was very apologetic and gave good service. I want to believe it is just this location that the food was disappointing. For the price, you would expect high quality food and it was the complete opposite. The $10 burger patty did not taste or look fresh (frozen patty??) and was a bit on the rough side (med.well, but it's ground beef!) and salty. The veggie wrap was more of a lettuce wrap because that is what I can taste the most of, even though it had other roasted veggies. The sweet potato fries were ok and the onion rings were good. The greens for the salad and burger also did not look fresh. Will not be going back to that location and will give Rachel's another chance at a different location. We've been to the Henderson location and that one was really good."}
{"text":"Can only review the acai bowl.  I've never seen an acai bowl like this before, some kind of brown sludge, I guess because it's blended with bananas?  No acai taste and not cold, just tastes like a lukewarm banana purée."}
{"text":"I've never heard about this place until my friend started working there. I'm very very picky when it comes to food &' was iffy on if I wanted to try it. I decided to get a chicken Caesar salad &' let me tell you.... It was DELICIOUS!!! The best chicken I have ever had in a salad. They cook it fresh &' then they slice it &' put it on top of the salad. The smoothies that they have are delicious as well. You can actually taste all the fruits in them. This place is definitely a great place to eat at because it's heathy &' the environment is wonderful. The staff is so friendly &' always making sure you're doing okay. Vanessa and Yesenia were wonderful. Vanessa helped me specialize my smoothie and Yesenia was very patient when I kept asking her what I should try &' what's good. They both are always so friendly &' always ask how my days been going. The customer service is beyond amazing. Love it here &' will always come back!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here often. I work at a business downtown and they are walking  distance. I absolutely LOVE the turkey club.. However, the last 2 times issues.. First melted plastic on my onion rings.. I gave it a pass.. Though I took pics.. Then I tried for the sweet potato fries they were AMAZING!! However, my turkey club had no bacon.. I wrote to them and they said \"what's club without bacon\".. That is the reason for the 1 star.. Not I'm sorry, or since you order so often, let us give you extra bacon next time.. Something more than \"what's a club without bacon\" would have been more of a professional and caring response.."}
{"text":"Justin was so friendly and nice. The vege burger was fantastic. Great atmosphere. The music was very Rock and roll."}
{"text":"First time here, busy Sunday, have a new puppy and wanted to socialize her a bit.  Tables were not getting bussed, I actually bussed ours so we had a place to sit.  Our order came quickly for how busy they were.  Food was okay, nothing exceptional.  Biggest issue was that the patio and the indoor seating areas were absolutely filthy.  The patio looks like it hasn't been power washed for months, between the filthy patio and dirty tables, we just wanted to get out of there."}
{"text":"Good healthy stuff, great smoothies, salads, sandwiches, and breakfast selections. I'm a vegetarian so this place is a nice welcome change around a lot of fast food and chain options around Vegas. They are good about modifying things on the menu too. THAT I like.  It wasn't over the top amaaaazing and different enough to give it 5 star, but it is good every time you go. You won't be disappointed. I recommend."}
{"text":"When I set my New Year's resolution to eat better and workout more (same resolution as last year), I was worried that I wouldn't be able to enjoy lunch out with my colleagues anymore. Working Downtown at The Mob Museum, it can be hard to resist temptation - thank goodness for Rachel's Kitchen! It's a great atmosphere with even better food, and there's something for everyone. I've tried several menu items and am never disappointed. The best part is, my coworkers can still have pasta or a burger (with more wholesome ingredients) and I can grab something off of the lighter menu. Short on time? That's no issue either. Rachel's Kitchen is not fast food, but a great, quick meal."}
{"text":"Casual, fast dining in a nice outdoor setting. I didn't even know people could go to Lou Ruvo if they didn't have business there, so it was a great excuse to check the place out. They have a nice outdoor garden where you can wander and see the sculptures after you finish your lunch. I had the grilled cheese. Very tasty."}
{"text":"I love the menu and the quality of this place. Been coming since they opened. Hands down one of my favorite places to eat BUT......one of my least favorite places to call and place and order. I have been a patron for years and can honestly say, the service is just plain BAD on the front end. I have walked out on occasion because they forgot to put my order in, or made me wait in a long line only to pick up my cold to-go food. It's like that girlfriend or boyfriend that you keep breaking up with only to go back to. Again, I'm in love with the quality and vast choices of healthy menu items and overall kitchen service, but just this morning I had to be placed on hold twice, (total time to place my order, 5 mins for 3 items?) Total wait time once I got there, 12mins after paying for it.  They also but my Acia bowl (cold) on top of my protein lovers scramble (HOT!) Attention to detail is lacking here. Well, sadly, we 'broke up' again today... I hope when or if I ever come back... The service problem is fixed! Thanks for listening.  Mike A. mike@utclv.com"}
{"text":"Had the turkey avocado sandwich and it was delicious. Peanut butter blast smoothie also great. Price is just too expensive. $30 for lunch makes it unlikely I will return."}
{"text":"Great food, I went here when it first opened, only downside was gave me cold fries but counteracted it by giving me a gift card. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was that I had the barbecue bacon burger multiple times, but once it gave me a stomach ache, and another time it made me hurl!"}
{"text":"The decor of the place is pretty nice. The staff was friendly and helpful. I ordered the BBQ bacon burger which was nice and came on wheat buns. The only thing I wished they did was ask how well I liked my burger cooked but other than that I was great."}
{"text":"Kathy Wilson and her team who run this location are amazing.  The customer service is unparalleled.  The food is always delicious and served to you with a huge smile.  The environment is welcoming and comfortable.  It is like you are home with friends just hanging out.  They other amazing thing about Kathy and this location is they are super involved with the Downtown community.  They are the perfect partner if you need catering for an event or just fun evening with girlfriends. I can not say enough good things about the staff and the food.  It is a guaranteed win!!! Trust me and just go :)"}
{"text":"Love Rachel's kitchen! This is my first time at this location which is by my house.  Food is the same great quality.  There is a great option for outdoor sitting.  Great service."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Good food. Fair prices. I now see why a lot of my friends rave about this place."}
{"text":"Was really pleased with my lunch experience at Rachel's this week! I've dined inside for breakfast but this was my first lunch at this new location. Enjoyed a terrific Cobb salad and iced tea on the outdoor patio. Salad was studded with plenty of chicken, avocado and other goodies. Not overly dressed with dressing. Just perfect. Love the iced tea and the outdoor patio is great. I'll be back for lunch."}
{"text":"While I was conducting some work in downtown Las Vegas,  I found myself on a short break and decided to have an early lunch.  I stumbled across Rachel's Kitchen thankfully, because it is slightly obscured, from the  sidewalk and roadway, by planter boxes.

Inside the cafe has somewhat of a retro vibe, with a healthy breakfast and lunch menu.

I opted for the Protein Lovers Scramble and I was well pleased.  The food was quickly prepared and fresh.  The scramble incorporated eggs, diced grilled chicken, bacon, spinach, and was topped with cheddar cheese. It also came with a side of wheat toast and some very tasty potato squares. 

The staff was very friendly and professional.  In fact the only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star rating is that two of the three coffee crafts were empty.

If you are looking for a light and healthy breakfast option to keep you going through the day, I would definitely refer you to Rachel's Kitchen."}
{"text":"My husband and I live pretty close by and decided to try this place out.  The sandwiches and pastas sounded good and they serve breakfast all day...sounded promising at first!  Who doesn't love breakfast food at dinner?!  Well...then we looked at the prices.  Holy smokes.  These portions better be good.  I ordered a breakfast burrito and paid an additional $1.50 to add bacon.  My husband ordered a BBQ bacon burger with onion rings and we split a small soda.  Total came to about $22.  Whoa...we could have eaten at a sit down restaurant for that price.  :\  We then proceeded to wait for 20 minutes or so.  It seemed to take forever.  When we finally got our food, we were a bit disappointed to see the portions.  My husband got literally 4 onion rings on the side and I expected my burrito to be a lot larger for nearly $10.  My breakfast burrito was just ok taste-wise.  I didn't like how it was pretty much all egg with hardly any salsa and I could barely taste the cheese.  For some reason the avocado wasn't spread out evenly throughout the burrito, just a big chunk of avocado on the end of the burrito.  They need to distribute the ingredients more evenly to balance out the tastes.  The part that really ticked me off was the bacon I paid an additional $1.50 for...The bacon was just tiny little chunks sprinkled throughout the egg and there was hardly any of it!  Seriously?  I paid extra for this?!  I couldn't even taste the bacon in it so I feel it was a total waste to get it.  Extremely disappointing and a total rip-off.

Overall, the place is just way too overpriced for average food.  We probably won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Quite a find.  Tucked away in a non descript strip mall is this adorable little eatery filled with the freshest ingredients,  cute little tables with an outdoor patio.  I had originally tasted the catered garden pasta which was the best pesto Alfredo I've eaten but it seemed like too much for a quick lunch.  So, instead we opted for the grilled cheese and the vegetarian sandwich.  Both came on thick sour dough bread.  The cheeses were of excellent quality.  The favors a terrific blend of old home and trendy.  The smoothy we splurged for with it was as good as any anywhere.  We will definitely go back.  I only wish there was one in the northwest area of town as we would probably become regulars.  Not to miss.  But don't tell anyone.  I don't want it to get overrun."}
{"text":"Still love coming here for lunch! Fresh food, calm atmosphere, and friendly staff. Plus, I'm never too weighed down when I head back to the office (as in, not falling asleep at my computer). Big fan of Rachel's chicken salad!!"}
{"text":"Rachel Kitchen is located a the base of the Ogden Condos, it's not that obvious to find but well worth looking for.
The staff was friendly and the food delicious.
I highly recommend having the \"Favorite\" omelette dish as well as the Acai Berry smoothie, it is to die for.
In an ideal world there would be more places like this and less Starbucks"}
{"text":"Love Rachel's Kitchen! Quality food and amazing customer service. It's my favorite place to go for breakfast/lunch, especially when I want something fast and healthy!"}
{"text":"While Rachael's Kitchen is in an ideal location, it is a textbook example of how a restaurant should not be run. The food is, at best, mediocre. The service, while cheerful, is inept. Since breakfast is offered all day, the three pancakes I ordered at 2:00pm were served at room temperature rather than hot, without butter. When I asked for some butter, the server cheerfully brought three rock hard cubes of ice cold butter. How can ice cold butter melt on cold pan cakes?

Coffee is offered light, medium, and dark roast. All the carafes except one, were empty, and from that I could only get one cup of light roast (although I wanted dark roast).and even that cup was cold. The manager apologized and promised that all the carafes would be filled with fresh hot coffee in five to ten minutes. When we finished or meal, almost an hour later, only one carafe of light roast coffee was finished and nothing else was being brewed.

My companion ordered an omelet. It was served tough, tasteless, and barely warm.

While there were several what appeared to be high school or college students running the restaurant, the whole atmosphere appeared to be disorganized if not chaotic. I asked if the owner was there, and was told she was not and only stops by perhaps once a week. I guess if one is an absentee owner of a business, leaving the day to day operation to kids, one should not be surprised to have these results."}
{"text":"When this location first opened I came here almost everyday for lunch. It was convenient and I liked the turkey sandwich I ordered. The price was a little high but still within a reasonable range. It normally cost me $11.65, approx., to get my sandwich. Later they implemented a military discount which brought the total to $10.65. Today I came in to order the same thing I've ordered since it opened almost a year ago and it the total was around $13.50. Seriously? First they don't honor the military discount because you have to be in uniform. First off, that's a pretty good way of never having to give a discount. Military families use the same source of income, at least i do. So if you give a spouse $1 off you're still giving that same military personnel a $1 off. What's the difference? It just seems very unfair to me. I wouldn't of been upset if it was just that. But now the prices have raised which I understand that's how businesses work. But $13 for a sandwich that's just turkey,  bacon, lettuce, and mustard?? Needless to say I will not be coming back. The people here are not as friendly as the previous staff.  Before when I came in they would offer me a cup for water and I always declined but today I was thirsty so I asked for a cup for water and when I got my receipt it had a charge for the cup. Really??? You're charging me more,  taking away a discount because my husband didn't come with me in uniform and now something I used to get for free is now $$."}
{"text":"Found this place completely by accident as we were trying to decide whether to eat over at Kings Fish. We were greeted with a friendly and warm personality by the manager Dakota. He was patient with us as we were indecisive about what we wanted. The food was delicious. We ordered the mac and cheese and breakfast burrito. Both were hot, fresh and tasty. Dakota's customer service went above and beyond. It's nice to see service like this, especially at the end of the night when the place was about to close."}
{"text":"GREAT place for breakfast. They have delicious vegetable and fruit juices. Their fruit is always fresh, not like the chain restaurant down the street, and the food is done right. Came upon Rachel's Kitchen after having to quickly leave Baby Stacks because the odor of grease was so strong and nauseating. Have enjoyed many items from the breakfast menu and definitely need to try lunch items since their wraps look good."}
{"text":"Great brain food after picking up a film permit next door and what beautiful building!!!  Love the Incredible Hulk smoothie."}
{"text":"I love this healthy and delicious place to eat when I visit Downtown. Rachel's is great for breakfast - love the coffee and specialty coffee options. My favorite is the scrambled eggs with tomatoes and basil. So simple and so well prepared. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, and I appreciate the wi-fi. Also a great spot for a fresh juice or smoothie for an afternoon pick me up. Have not tried lunch yet - that is for my next visit. I tell all my friends in southern Utah to stop by Rachel's when they go to the Smith Center or the Container Park."}
{"text":"The food is very refreshing. Just make sure you have some time on your hands. A little pricey but great quality."}
{"text":"This Rachel's is the best! We go here all the time and love the whole menu. The staff and service is excellent. We even get food to go and take it to work later."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.. I truly enjoy the bbq chicken wrap.... Ive since tried the signature salads.. Its fantastic... Love this place"}
{"text":"I'm having lunch at Rachel's Kitchen for the third time. And for the third time, I am very pleased. The options available range from breakfast to dinner, healthy to sinful, so there's always something new to try. Today I'm having the BBQ Chicken Wrap with a side salad (with romaine, spinach, cucumbers, shredded carrots, radishes and tomatoes). So many great ingredients! Top quality, for sure. 

Also, the service is impeccable. Each time, the server went above and beyond to make sure my experience was pleasant. I highly recommend Rachel's Kitchen for any meal, any time of the day."}
{"text":"The food is always very tasty! The customer service is hit and miss though. The younger staff seems to lack the old school customer service mentality. The food is good enough to keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito is great, however the rest of the menu is a bit lacking.  For a health food joint they don't offer that many healthy options.  Smoothies are good but their juice recipes really need work.  Vegaterian/ Vegas options are a joke. The service is also extremely slow, I've waited up to 30 min before for simple breakfast food with a slow steady stream of customers.  For what I ordered this made now sense.  I expected much better."}
{"text":"I love having a Rachel's Kitchen right by my house. This location has a cute little outdoor sitting area to which I took advantage on the perfect fall day in Vegas.  The food and service was great per usual from other Rachel's Kitchen I have been too."}
{"text":"On a road trip and in desperate need of something resembling healthy food, I turned to Yelp and was not disappointed. Yes, this place is a chain and inside an outdoor shopping mall (two things that are usually  deal breakers for me) but they have a good selection of food that seems fresh and was tasty.  I got the Wilshire smoothie and I tried some of my husband's Sunrise smoothie, they were both very good and made with fresh ingredients in front of us. Very tasty and refreshing, not watery at all like some places that use ice for filler."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come in here all the time.  I'm vegetarian and gluten free but he isn't, and we each are obsessed with several things on the menu. Everything is consistently delicious and the staff is always super friendly."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is quickly becoming the go-to spot for a great, healthy lunch in the Fremont East area.  Owners Kathy and Karen have put together an awesome staff and a perfect menu, and the result is consistently good, healthy fare.  I've worked my way through most of the menu, and the highlights (for me) are the salads, smoothies, and the omelets.  I live nearby, so I'm there often, but haven't grown tired of the food; could never grow tired of the lovely staff.  They have wifi, the place is immaculate, and  the seating is incredibly comfortable (unlike other spots nearby).  The crowd is a mix of DTLV start-up pioneers, attorneys from the nearby courthouse area, and tourists who prefer fresh squeezed juices (try \"Sweet Greens\") rather than being another snout in the Fremont Experience trough."}
{"text":"Someone brought wraps and salad from here and it is yummy and divine.  A fresh break from the touristy stuff."}
{"text":"The pear muffin is the best!!! Delicious band not dry and full of flavor. Perfect for a breakfast on the go. This will fill you up. So tasty!! 

The seats are super comfortable and the decor is very posh. I love this place. 10/10 will revisit"}
{"text":"This place is the bee's knees. The food selection is incredible and I've yet to be disappointed by anything I've ordered. The icing on the cake is that they always have a small, well thought out, selection of craft beers. Happy hour is most days from 4-6 I believe.  Staff is always super friendly and the food comes out quick. The atmosphere is great as well."}
{"text":"Such a fun spot on Sunday mornings for \"music and mimosas.\" 
There's a live band that plays outside of the cafe, creating a great ambiance. 

The menu has a wide range of vegetarian options, as well as those for the carnivores among us. 
All of the options are pretty healthy, and everything I have tried has been delicious(breakfast burrito, garden burger, grilled cheese).
Order the sweet potato fries as your side, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Used to allow dogs out on the patio - no longer.  Employee made that very clear today - will not be back.  If your policy has changed, that's ok - but I had no reason to know."}
{"text":"Wonderful place with great food and atmosphere.  My family of five thoroughly enjoyed the food and getting away from the strip.  The Fettuccine Alfredo was outstanding (not too cheesy as many have a tendency to be).  We loved the sweet potato fries as well.  The patio is beautiful and a great place to eat and enjoy the food and company."}
{"text":"We are visiting Las Vegas from Australia.  Rachel's Kitchen was fabulous. Just great simple healthy food.  Couldn't fault it"}
{"text":"This is a great, little place for breakfast...though they offer lunch items too. The food is fresh and it comes out quickly. They have an assortment of fresh squeezed juices, but I went with watermelon and it was yummy. They have gluten free bread, but it isn't well advertised, so be sure to ask for it. The Favorite scramble did not disappoint when it came out with gobs of goat cheese on top. Definitely a place to return and enjoy."}
{"text":"I always take people to Rachel's when they come to visit town!  I'm a health nut and this is a dream come true for my kind:)   I would definitely recommend any salad and the Energizer juice!   Service is great too, they are always super friendly"}
{"text":"Always a good place to eat! Chocolate chip banana pancakes are the best and the people who work here are so friendly!"}
{"text":"This place was perfect for breakfast. Just around the corner from El Cortez, where we were staying, Rachel's is a step above the rest and welcome change from the casino fare. Fruit was fresh, shakes were delicious, French toast was terrific with excellent bread, and the kids loved the side of potatoes. Service was with a big smile and she made our mornings. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out Rachel's Kitchen today. My husband ordrerd the \"sauteed mushroom burger with a side of sweet potato fries I ordered the half soup half sandwich entree and selected half turkey avocado with gluten-free bread and the vegetable chicken rice soup of the day. We were both impressed with flavor,presentation and customer service. We were able to check in on Yelp and receive a free glass of wine but we opted for a soft drink instead of the wine since it was rather early in the day.    We will be back to try more interesting dishes and smoothies!"}
{"text":"I ordered a healthy yummy salad.  I've enjoyed everything 
I 've had here but last time my daughter got the Alfredo and OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!  3 of us shared her Alfredo!  So so good!"}
{"text":"My team ordered in catering for here for lunch and it was amazing!!!!! Everyone on my team was extremely happy! Food was healthy yet delicious. Everything was seasoned very well. Will definitely continue to order lunch orders from Rachel's.

We had the pesto pasta which was amazing and so tasty! Also had a great fruit salad today also"}
{"text":"Clean Californian style cooking,  I had a sample of the curry wrap and it was good, i myself went for the lighter side menu and had a grilled chicken sandwich.

service was quick, some outdoor seating , meal was great.  a bit on the pricey side, but then its summerlin what do you expect.

ill be back"}
{"text":"I had been to the District almost every month but I have never tried this joint.

We patronized this kind of  recently popular & highly glorified & self-claimed gourmet healthy yet fast food style chain on 07/12/2017.

We ordered 2 very simple salad and yet to our disappointment:

Kale & pear salad - insufficient / incorrect pairing of dressing thus makes the salad too dry to eat.

Asian chicken salad - chicken fillets are over grilled and therefore they are naturally overcooked  and dry & charred too much."}
{"text":"SKIP THIS PLACE. Self serve with a factory taste and a Giant TIP JAR SIGN for no service and robot behavior."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is a wonderful place for brunch and the menu has something for everyone. As a local, I enjoy this location in Henderson and all of the shopping that surrounds it. Don't forget the happy hour specials for half-priced mimosas!"}
{"text":"I am a visitor to Las Vegas and got to eat at Rachel's kitchen.  Keep going back as the food is fresh and delicious.  Maybe on my next trip I will try another location."}
{"text":"Over priced, foods not worth it. I have been wanting to try this place for awhile,I'm truly disappointed."}
{"text":"First time I've been here first I order the salad it was pretty big portion thought it was going to be smaller after that I order the bacon BBQ cheeseburger it was delicious everyone was friendly and nice I love here"}
{"text":"Just arrived and was  greeted by friendly staff. Everything sounds tasty. I started out with the Incredible Hulk smoothie. It was very good. I shared it with my daughter and she enjoyed it also. The turkey burger was delicious;  juicy and perfectly seasoned. I had to get my mixed veggie salad to go. My hubby and daughter both loved their burgers. It was overall very nice. Clean and spacious. Great food. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Maybe this should be a 1 star but I can't be so hurtful I guess I came in for lunch last week it was very slow but the employees working that day were all new faces I have lunch here at least twise when Iconcome to Vegas the employees there this time seemed angry like they don't want to be there they just aren't welcoming at all they seem to be there to make a Pay check and that's it my food was cold I ordered the club sandwich with sweet potato fries I got like 15 cold fries  I asked for no tomatoes but still got them I didn't want to disturb the girl at the counter she just looked angry her atitud was just intimidating so I just let it go don't remember her name it started with a V I remember the Gm they had Liz she was awesome to bad she's gone"}
{"text":"This place is great. I love the wraps and potato spuds. Customer service is great, and no long wait times at all. The smoothies are also great!"}
{"text":"Fresh, very good, great service. Tried the Chicken Curry Wrap just for something different...Awesome. Reasonable prices, .I'll be back."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place at a health fair. I drove all the way to the SW side of town because the broccoli chopped salad is to die for...never had anything like it. Then I found out they have a Hendo location SCOOOOOORE. It's open for breakfast and lunch and always seems crowded. I don't get mad or complain about the wait - the staff is friendly and the food is definitely worth a short wait."}
{"text":"Nice little place next to gate D6. Ordered steel cut oatmeal with fresh bananas and strawberries. Looked like they had alot of good breakfast,  lunch and to go options as well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is awesome and I must say I am more and more impressed every time. The service is amazing, the food is great and I can't wait to return. Big shout-out to Vince for helping with outstanding service."}
{"text":"Consistently good reliable food at the Hualapai location. Always takes 15 minutes and is ready when I arrive for pick up. Good varied menu."}
{"text":"Ordered Cheeseburger with fries. Very dry could not see the cheese. 2 thin slices of tomato and a few pieces of lettuce, fries were undercooked and tasteless.Wife had
Rachels chickensalad sandwich on cibatta bread. There was no chicken we could
Find in the sandwich had mostly grapes. First and last time. Wasted $20.00"}
{"text":"Love this place! healthy options yet still tasty. They are pretty consistent quality wise. I like to order the cobb salad or the turkey avocado club with smoked chipotle mayo. Can never go wrong with either one. Staff is also friendly and helpful everytime I come in."}
{"text":"Rachel's kitchen, what a wonderful place to eat. I remember when I was young and they first opened it. I haven't stopped eating there since. The service is on point, and they make amazing smoothies. My granddaughter loves your food too. Thank you for Rachel's kitchen."}
{"text":"I'm in town visiting a friend and she took me here. Our server was awesome and I enjoyed my lunch and mimosa :) next time in the area I'll be definitely come back to eat here!"}
{"text":"Their peanut butter blast smoothie was delicious, great after workout fuel when you add a scoop of whey to it. Their gluten free French toast with potatoes was delicious too."}
{"text":"Fresh, simple, and delicious. The burgers are fantastic..so good that I keep saying I'm going to try other things on the menu but always end up getting a burger :) Friendly staff also."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is always consistent!  I enjoy their juice selection too; I am currently obsessed with Popeye's Secret.  I love that the chicken is hormone free, it makes me feel better about what I am eating when I'm out.  I haven't been in for breakfast yet, but that's Cheers to Rachel's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"We were scouting for lunch place in downtown and one of the crew from Rachel's Kitchen was passing out fliers to people walking by and since we were indecisive where to dine we just gave it a try. That pamphlet seems to work pretty well coz as soon as we waited for our order, their queue line was already about 15. 

I asked the server if what is good on their menu and obviously he pointed out the most expensive one which I realized upon done eating and checking our receipts. It's not that I complain about it but the thought of remind me how a server would really try to upsell a product to get more money on their pocket. Overall, it was a decent place and healthy choice."}
{"text":"Today was a special day for me at this place.  My mother's home cooking of French toast and crispy bacon was the best.  I walked in here today and ordered a side of crispy bacon and the French toast.  I was so pleased that I stopped and spoke with the front end service people and the cook after eating.  I thanked them for serving the best food ever.  Today my mother passed away and is now with God in Heaven.  I am so sure these folks will continue a tradition of serving the best food just like MOM. Thank you mom for looking down on us today to remembering what good food is for.

Thanks
Kevin"}
{"text":"I love the \"the favorite\" breakfast menu. The scramble egg went pretty well with the goat cheese. The basil and tomato egg was simple and delicious. It's a cute and delicious place for breakfast. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm soooo excited that there is a Rachel's Kitchen around the corner from my house now. It is tucked away inside the Hilton but it's there and I'm soooo happy! I will definitely be going there a lot more. Love Rachel's"}
{"text":"I live near by so I am always at Rachel's Kitchen.......Luuuucky (my Napoleon Dynamite voice)

Here are some of my favorites:
Energizer- fresh squeezed goodness
Chicken Mushroom Burger- perfectly tender, best you will ever have my friend
Ultimate Grilled Cheese- HOLY $&^% . its name says it all
Smoked Turkey & Avocado Sandwich- Mmm.Mm.Mm. The chipotle mayo is what sets it off

I really appreciate that this place is far from your regular commercial restaurant chains with heavily processed food. Rachel's has fresh, high quality food at a reasonable price. They tend to stay busy but the service is excellent and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Im so bummed!!! The Acai bowl is awful... not much acai blend... way too much granola (to the point where it was dry and i was basically eating only granola) also they chopped ONE strawberry and neatly placed it on top. They didnt have any honey drizzled on top (like most places do) or add different types of fresh fruits on top. I will never waste my money on this item again. Such a let down... I'll go a block away for my acai bowls"}
{"text":"Love this small shop in the District. Fresh, quick and delicious options at a reasonable price. Love the outdoor seating. Also very dog friendly."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had.  I was only person in the entire place, 6 people working and I still waited 25 minutes for a chicken salad sandwich."}
{"text":"Upon walking in first thing to notice was the very dirty floor. Food and bits of trash were scattered about. 

Loved the colors a bit sparse but comfortable 

I didn't really feel like I was in a kitchen. There were employees cleaning silverware and tossing dishes under the front counter throughout the visit. It should be renamed Rachel's dishroom. It was very loud and noisy from all of the dish work going on right next to where you order and eat. 

The food was good. Very tasty a bit pricey. The staff all smiled and was very accommodating and nice. Could have used a bit more kitchen feel and less i was in the dishroom. Doubt if would return. 

$3 mimosa was a good draw though and delicious. Maybe for that."}
{"text":"Great gluten free options. I has zero issues and highly recommend.  Bread was from rubys and was very good as well. 

Help staff was very knowledgeable and kitchen handled minimizing risk of cross contamination beautifully as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  They are always so friendly and have great tasting stuff for those of the vegetarian persuasion.  They also do fresh juices which is a huge plus.  My husband who is not a vegetarian even likes it."}
{"text":"Ah! I don't know what to say. This place has some great options for those who love simplicity and good eats. Their wraps are large and amazing. I love their alcoholic beverage options and happy hour is always a winner! Kathy and the staff are wonderful and ensure that your experience is going to earn your repeat business. There are various times throughout the year where they also host Karaoke at the Kitchen (usually a contest with prizes). If I didn't work so much, I'd be there more regularly but the good news is they have delivery to downtown businesses and residences. It's a win win place and in a great location The Ogden!"}
{"text":"I used to think Rachel's Kitchen was more like Sandy's Dining Room and would often bring out-of-towners here for a casual lunch when they asked for a little \"local flavor.\" I've always had a pleasant experience here until recently when I brought my mom, and ended up leaving with my tail between my legs because I was so embarrassed I'd hyped it up for her and then let her down! 

My mom decided to order for us - she wanted the Ultimate Grilled Cheese with a mixed green salad, and I wanted 1/2 440 Sandwich with soup. While ordering mine, the cashier asked what side she wanted, so she said sweet potato fries. The cashier handed my mom a number and we sat at our table, chatting and waiting. And waiting. And waiting. 

Friends, couples, and colleagues came, ate, and went while we sat at our table, with my mom commenting that this was probably not a good place for a work lunch. While we sat there, one of the runners came out and told us the 440 does not come on ciabatta bread like I'd wanted, so I opted for wheat - couldn't they have told us this while we were ordering and not 10-15 minutes later? The food finally came out and instead of sweet potato fries, we had limp French fries on my plate with no soup. We called a runner to explain and he promptly brought out an extra serving of sweet potato fries without taking my plate back - kudos for not having to make us wait even longer. When we inquired about the soup, however, another employee kept asking us for our number that we no longer remembered. She was finally able to pull up our check and said that I had ordered the 1/2 sandwich with a side - I didn't even know that was an option on the menu, especially since my mom had only asked for the sweet potato fries because she'd been prompted. It was like Seinfeld's \"No soup for you!\" except with less yelling :( 

I'd be willing to go back again because I think the food in my other experiences had been fresh and simple without feeling overtly expensive, but Mama K probably won't be coming along because she wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. I had the daily special Chicken and Hummus wrap. It was delicious. Pretty busy over lunch time. Nice patio out front and the weather was nice enough to sit out under the umbrella."}
{"text":"Just found this Rachels on my way to the Summerlin Post Office.  Very large inside.  Cant tell that from the outside. The food and service were great as I find with other Rachels locations.  The reason I'm writing this review is that I see they are doing a fundraiser on Sept 1 for the leukemia and lymphoma society, a great cause. I think that's awesome and hope they raise lots of $."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Healthy choices. Smoothies are sooo good. Try the Hawaiian Bliss. Coffee is meh."}
{"text":"This place is great. Yes, like other yelpers said, it is a bit pricey but it's good clean food not 15 seconds in a microwave crap. You get what you pay for!!"}
{"text":"Nice little place. We were staying at the Plaza and wanted to avoid the long lines and oversized portions of the breakfast restaurant in the hotel. This was a nice change. It's located off Fremont St. Order is placed at the counter and they'll bring you your food. Self serve coffee bar with unlimited refills. I had the breakfast grilled cheese that came with potatoes. It was delicious. Big thing for me, it was a normal portion. Free wifi and a counter overlooking the street with charging stations. Small intimate place. Saw a family at one table and the children were having fun with the lunchbox of crayons and coloring books provided by the staff. Nice choice to get away from the long lines, noisy venues, and Flintstone sized meals."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is delicious! They use great quality products! Great sandwiches , salads and shakes!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, yummy food, clean bathroom, and amazing interior! I've only been to Rachel's Cafe once so far, but I can't wait to go back. Ever since my first visit, I've seriously contemplated ditching my usual haunts from Manhattan.

I was at nearby Makers & Finders Coffee earlier in the day, but unfortunately, I was having difficulties with their wifi and actually really needed Internet access. After staying there for a couple hours, I decided to look for a new coffee shop in the area. Good ol' Yelp suggested Rachel's to me. Thank you, Yelp!

The shop is easy to miss if you're not paying attention, but once you step inside, you'll feel welcomed by the  decorations, and all of staff were very nice to me, i bother  this guy with a lot of requests and he always was very nice to me.
 I stayed for a couple hours and didn't have any problems with the wifi. Plus, I loved the music that they played.
As for food and drink, I got an iced coffee and a turkey  sandwich. The coffee was decent, but not the best that I've had. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich. All the ingredients were fresh, and they weren't skimpy with the fixings.

Looking forward to trying more of their food and sticking around!"}
{"text":"Had the Pear Arugala salad. This salad was delicious with the perfect amount of each ingredient including the dressing. Def going to be back to try other items that look great on the menu. Love that they serve breakfast all day. Sometimes you just want breakfast for dinner."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito was light & tasty, not too heavy.  The Protein lovers breakfast was great, grilled chicken, spinach, cheese - very good"}
{"text":"I have had Rachel's Kitchen twice and both times the food and service has been phenomenal. On both occasions I have used the online ordering which I love because it gives wonderful descriptions on every dish. When I got to the restaurant they had my food ready to go with no wait. I was helped by Ceanna who was great. She was very prompt, very polite, & made our experience very welcoming. I was very pleased with her excellent service. We got our food to-go and I must say it travels well. I ordered the Veggie Wrap and absolutely LOVE it! The vegetables were cooked to perfection and the eggplant and roasted red peppers are so yummy. Portion sizes are perfect; my meal was very filling and everything tasted very fresh. On my first visit I had the 440 sandwhich which is also VERY VERY delicious. I love that Rachel's has vegan and vegetarian options. They make it easy to eat healthy. I will return to this location. Thanks for being so great."}
{"text":"Smoothies are yummy... Sometimes a hit or miss. I'd say more consistent than the other locations... But COME ON $10 for a burger and you get 10 fries... Not the first time either. Other than that no complaints. But fix your fry PROBS!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and service and beautiful menus. Disappointing food. The portion of fries was almost smaller than the unasked for dish of ketchup served on sandwich place (ripoff in the name of design?) and chicken sandwich interesting but kind of a mess. Weak coffee and though it's not hugely expensive it seems like a place where packaging trumps substance. Should have went back to Cracked Egg- a drive from here and low key but wonderful real food that satisfies. Far different than this place. 

Not to pack it on but It seems a wasted meal given so many other choices. The sour dough tasted like white bread, the goat cheese like cream cheese and... I won't go on. Back to the Cracked Egg tomorrow."}
{"text":"Being in the service industry myself I absolutely can't stand horrible customer service. I had never been to this location and brought a friend who had never had Rachel's Kitchen. The girl working the front couldn't have been more rude. I work right down the street and won't be using this location again regardless of the convenience ."}
{"text":"I had a really poor, over-priced veggie burger here. The place was full and busy at 3:00 in the afternoon, so apparently it's popular. I'll give it another chance, but even the salad I sampled from my dining partner (since mine was so bad) was just OK."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for fresh juice!!  Carrot, cucumber & lemon!  And the breakfast was great as well!!!"}
{"text":"The employees are miserable here and consistently provide crappy service but I was a loyal customer because the food was good. However, my most recent experience with the food was a joke. I ordered an acai bowl and it was horrendous. It was loaded with granola and had a couple stingy spoonfuls of Acai at the bottom. They might as well call it a granola bowl with an acai garnish."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some great food anytime of the day then Rachel's Kitchen is the place. AMAZING customer service!!!!!!! Everyone is super friendly and helpful. The signature pasta is amazing along with the Chinese chicken salad. They catered our Christmas party and it was a big hit."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch. Kitchen lost our order, waited 30 minutes for food...  My kids were kicking each other with restlessness by the time it arrived. Got a quick apology upon delivery of food at the table, then nobody came around afterward. I regret tipping upfront. Felt really ignored.  2 thumbs down for today's service, they're normally better."}
{"text":"Clean environment.

I think its way over price for what they serve. 

I had the Caesar wrap but it was overly salty."}
{"text":"The tuna sandwich is the BEST!  Great fresh and healthy food.  This place is always busy and it's always great every time I go."}
{"text":"This place was great for any airport,  but ESPECIALLY compared to the poor food options at McCarran Airport. While everything else at this airport feels unhealthy,  this food was fresh, healthy, and had great flavors. 

After all the good-for-me food, I had to splurge on a brownie. Oh my goodness, I need the recipe! It was really gooey inside with chocolate chip pieces. The combination of gooey and chewy was on point. They're addictive!!"}
{"text":"Although I've been to Rachel Kitchen twice, I must say the food here is very organic and good. If you like eating healthy and your in the Centennial area, well this is the place to go or if you want a nice burger this is definitely the place to get a burger. The burger that I had here was very rich in flavor and mouth watering. And the employees here are very generous.
The only negative thing I have to say about this place is when you ordering it from home, the food gets soggy and very moist from what I'm told, it's best to eat it there."}
{"text":"We went here last weekend after working out. I've been to Rachel's before and have always liked it. There food is fresh and relatively healthy, so I'm not sure why I don't come for often. Anyway, we passed it on our walk home from the gym and decided to stop in for a bite to eat.

We split a 440 sandwich and a  spinach salad. I really liked the fact that they had the knowledge of  ingredients in the menu. Especially since we'd just got done working out and I was more calorie-conscious than usual. So Mario took care of us and also brought our food to the table with a big smile. He also recommended sandwiches from the light menu. This place has a great service. 
The salad was big and fresh.The sandwich was pretty good. It was  full of chicken, and the ciabatta bread is the best.

Rachel's Kitchen has really good, fresh salads and sandwiches. They're better than most chain sandwich places. Definitely my favorite place to get lunch."}
{"text":"Agree with the reviews about service. Our order took over 20 minutes and it wasn't even busy at all. Many people who came in after us all got their orders before us. Then to add insult to injury they put the mayo on the sandwich which we had asked to be left off so we had to wait for it to be redone. The french fries were also cold when they arrived. The manager came out and apologized and comped the one sandwich but it was still an unpleasant experience. Food was just so so. Then while we are eating our sandwich outside these two really nasty looking pigeons are going to town on the food left on the tables. It was so disgusting they were on the plates and bowls I went inside to suggest they clear out the tables. After a few minutes someone came out to finally clear the tables and shooed away the pigeons which then flew right over another diners table while they were eating. Thank goodness it wasn't ours! The fellow dining patron and I both mentioned we hope they have good dishwashers!! Anyway I must leave this place as the pigeons are going after another table and I can't take it anymore. Please if you are going to have outside dining clear the plates often!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I frequent the location on N Durango, so I have something to compare this location to.  The counter staff are friendly, the delivery to the table was done with a smile, the burger was over cooked, but otherwise consistent with Rachael's Kitchen quality.  The serving of sweet potato fries seemed small, but again very tasty.  
The lack of coffee in the beverage area was a slight bummer (great when added to their iced tea) but maybe people in the NW area drink more coffee, lol"}
{"text":"Love Rachel's kitchen. The food is awesome and healthy. Price is good and ambience is just right."}
{"text":"Amazing. The sweet greens juice is best juice I've ever had.  The food is really good too."}
{"text":"Occasionally, I try to undo all the damage yelping does to my arteries.  So...I head on down to Rachel's Kitchen.

My go-to drink is Sweet Greens with kale, cucumber, lemon, ginger, spinach, apple, etc.  Yes, it sounds revolting unless you're a hippie.  However,  I tell myself it's good for me (guh, who actually likes eating kale??) and gulp it down.  They have other, less intense juices like watermelon, if you're a wuss.

They also serve food and it's pretty good.  I enjoy the vegetarian sandwich.  It has goat cheese and I truly believe most things taste better with goat cheese.  They also have some great vinaigrette salad dressings. 

Also, randomly, they serve alcohol.  I'm tempted to order oatmeal and wine one day.  Maybe I'll head there right now..."}
{"text":"The place was clean, spacious and the staff was friendly. Everyone else in the restaurant ordered hot food and appeared to be please. I ordered the Acai bowl and was underwhelmed. The ratio of granola to Acai was 3:1. The only fresh fruits were strawberries."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have a new healthy restaurant near us. We have just been for the first time and we definitely be back. I was very happy with a tuna salad sandwich!"}
{"text":"I work down the street at the Mob Museum and its hard to find good food thats good for you. Rachels Kitchen @ the Ogden is the perfect place to eat. My favorite is the 440 sandwich. It is soooooo good. The staff and the owners are very professional as well. If you are ever in downtown las vegas, Check out Rachels Kitchen. Next I want to try their smoothies. :)
Try the Peachberry Smoothie its delicious!"}
{"text":"I am happy that Rachel's Kitchen opened a location at the Cleveland Clinic for a quick bites and outside shaded seating. It is just across from the outlets. And it's the same owners at the Ogden location so the service is great!  I like the grilled cheese, if you have a chance try it it's really good! :)"}
{"text":"Very good food and very friendly staff.  Really enjoy the sandwiches for lunch time.  They have an outdoor patio which is nice when the weather is good."}
{"text":"The chicken caesar wrap and sweet potatoes fries are delicious."}
{"text":"Place treats employees real bad. I was one head cook there be for they took over, The gm offered me a job and by law i had to take it, guess where he put in the dishwashing stion.

{"text":"Had lunch here with my mom and the chicken salad was delicious! Was helped by a very friendly Analisa who went out of her way to accommodate us!! Would def recommend Rachel's Kitchen!! :):)"}
{"text":"Not one for bad reviews, but Two stars for great service. JULIE is a superstar!! Food a complete letdown. Breakfast burrito was tasteless; no amount of hot sauce could help the soggy unseasoned filling. Pancakes are served with cheap sticky high fructose corn syrup probably straight out of a industrial plastic bottle. With this being a \"healthy\" establishment, an organic maple syrup is fitting for this upscale-ish priced cafe. Fresh pressed juice ok-"}
{"text":"Came here cause the kids didn't see anything for them on the menu at EAT. Kids liked the breakfast burrito and the pancakes. My wife got coffee which was seriously BAD. Honestly, these days there's just no excuse for having bad coffee. Asked them to make a fresh pot and it didn't help..."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Small, boutique sandwich shop with good selection of wine and quality food.  Fresh, yummy and filling.  I had the chicken tender wrap and the sweet potato side was delicious! 

Loved the free with with check in yelp.  Hannah (our cashier) was really helpful and the manager (I think- Vincent) was very nice and knows his customer service!  Highly recommend this to people in the area.  wish there was one where I lived!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is absolutely delicious!! I love how they have many options for different dietary restrictions as well"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast, blueberry pancakes were a perfect mix of buttery goodness without being over the top. Husband had omelette and it wad a good size. The only con is that it can get rather pricey if you want to upgrade to eggwhites and/or switch out fruit for the potatoes. At Cracked Egg, you can tailor your meal to anything you want and they won't charge you a dime to substitute or replace something with another. Potatoes nothing to write home, they are fried and not seasoned with anthing.
I do love the ambiance of being able to sit outside- they have the misters going during the day/night and theres enough trees right there to give some shade! Go for the pancakes and/or smoothies. Haven't been there for lunch or dinner, so can't comment on that. 
The fact that everything is made fresh though, and the staff is always friendly and you can enjoy the beautiful setting give this 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is the best Rachel's Kitchen in town. Very professional and friendly. The signature pasta and garden's pasta are both delicious and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Can't believe how terrible the people that work here are in the phone. Never in my life have I had to explain what I'm trying to order so much. Then to have them try and rip me off is just unacceptable.  I'm going to have to order breakfast from somewhere else now."}
{"text":"This is a great place for casual dining and fresh food. French Toast made with sourdough bread. Sounds odd, but its really good. Just had the lettuce wrapped cheeseburger- was really yummy. Vanessa was nice and helpful with explaining the menu."}
{"text":"Great wholesome, healthy and delicious. So healthy, though, that you'll need to add your own seasoning (salt, pepper, ketchup, etc). Here for the second time and will return. This time had egg white and spinach wrap, and my wife had sauteed mushroom cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. Good coffee, too!"}
{"text":"We came for breakfast and they were out of bacon. Burrito had recognizable ingredients and could have fed two. They were out of bacon. Blueberry pancakes came with a lovely side of fresh fruit. They were out of bacon. Coffee, service, location, were all fine. They were out of bacon. No bacon
Update 8/27:  The restaurant promptly contacted me about the review and offered  us complimentary breakfasts with bacon. I appreciated their quick response and very good customer service"}
{"text":"Coffee should be good being they use Peets. Unfortunately, they use so little of it it looks and tastes like dirty dishwater!!
The chicken noodle soup tastes like 3 times reheated canned Campbell's. The vibe of this place makes the customer think the food is healthy, but it's anything but. They don't even have fresh squeezed OJ."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. I came in one evening absolutely starving and no expectations but I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was amazing and were happy to cater to my allergies. I hate having to annoy people with my allergies but they are always so nice about it. Service with a smile. 

The food was great and I've been several times since. My husband is obsessed with their protein breakfast since there don't seem to be a lot of nice breakfast places around. We just came from Australia so breakfast is a pretty big deal and Rachel's Kitchen does it right!"}
{"text":"I've had their catering many times at our office. This is the second time that the chicken avocado sandwich has made me sick."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot to stop at when you are downtown and looking for a primo sandwich, wrap, salad or just craving a delicious smoothie (Peanut Butter Blast... yes please!) The \"Rachel's Chicken Salad\" is always my go-to, but I've been happy with everything else I've tried so far. I am a sucker for a good sandwich and the staff is friendly and always happy to offer recommendations based off your current cravings and dietary restrictions.

I've yet to try their breakfast, thats next on my list!"}
{"text":"A OK, nothing special or unusual. We had salad and two subs. My kid had pancake that she didn't want to finish. The fries coming with the subs seemed to be frozen, not fresh. The chairs we used were full with crumbles and they grossed me out completely, so I had to clean mine. Attention to details, cleanliness and fresher food could make a huge difference."}
{"text":"Pedestrian at best. For a \"healthy\" restaurant the only vegan choices they had for breakfast was a shake or oatmeal??!! Expand your menu"}
{"text":"Great service and great knowledge of the menu. Personable staff and great food! Will definitely visit agai"}
{"text":"It's really unfortunate that the food at Rachel's Kitchen is so good because lately their service has been downright terrible. I go to Rachel's Kitchen once a week for lunch. Up until today my biggest issue has been the cooks. Without fail, every time an attractive woman walks in, they call each over to the window to check her out and make comments to each other. I get that people might think that's a silly issue, but it's totally unprofessional. This is a restaurant, not a club, boys. Then today, it was pretty busy, but I ordered my salad to go and took a seat to wait. After about 25 minutes I went up to inquire about how much longer it might be. They had set my salad off to the side. The cashier just smiled and said, \"Oh, here it is. They must not have called your name.\" And by \"they\", I'm pretty sure she meant herself. No apology, no offering to refund my money, nothing. Just placing the blame on some mysterious person. 

So, there you have it. Great food, crappy service. I guess if you have all day to wait or want to feel good about the way you look by having the people making your food check you out, Rachel's Kitchen is for you!"}
{"text":"The food is great and they services is prompt. Finding a good parking space however is a complete different story"}
{"text":"I'm Visiting from out East but am staying on the strip and saw this place on Yelp and figured I'd give it a try. Nice and cozy little spot downtown. Customer service is great here--the owner was here today and was very accommodating ensuring that I was happy with my breakfast and my coffee--much appreciated !!"}
{"text":"Incredibly horrible service. Took 45 minutes to get food, which was just a sandwich. Never planning on returning to this location.  Even after the order came out,  it had a salad instead of onion rings and there was mayo  on it which I can't eat because I'm lactose intolerant. Staff is either incompetent or totally disregards customers"}
{"text":"Two words: Peet's coffee!!
Escaped the craziness of Fremont and found this great little local cafe. Delicious scrambles and fresh juices. Good music that wasnt too loud. Friendly employees. Came back a second morning just for the coffee."}
{"text":"The service was great, guy was very helpful by providing a vegan menu. But food was just not good. I had a vegetarian sandwich with fries and a acai bowl. The sandwich has roasted peppers, zucchini and eggplant. The eggplant was bitter and I had to take it out. The bread wasn't toasted enough to handle the vegetables and was soggy. And on top of that just had no flavor, maybe some hummus or vegan condiment might help? And the acai bowl had disappointing granola, if you could call it that. It was raisins and oatmeal. The acai part tastes like blended bananas, unripe bananas at that. And had hardly any \"acai\" flavor to it. Was just not worth it. The only good thing was the French fries and there wasn't enough to satisfy from the disappointment of the sandwich and smoothie bowl. I gave this place a second try but even going in starving I didn't find anything to satisfy my hunger. Oh I also got a juice and it was good but needed ice or at least colder than room temp."}
{"text":"Vanessa gives the best service and help when ordering! I love the juices here, and the food has a large variety."}
{"text":"The service was great an the food was amazing great place to come an the food is heathy witch is gray before or after the gym I love there smoked turkey avo sandwich"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  I like their juice and smoothies, but everything else is kind of blah.  But tonight was the last straw.  We went in about 30 minutes before closing tonight.  I ordered their grilled cheese and asked if they could add chicken to it, the girl taking my order said yes, and so I ponied up the $25 for two sandwiches with side salads, and sat down to wait.  We were the only ones in the place except for another couple who already had their food when we arrived.  I heard the cook ask the cashier about my chicken being added to the grilled cheese and she told him, yes that is what I ordered.  It took 20 minutes to get our sandwiches, while we were waiting we smelled burning bread and I assumed that, that had caused the wait.  We just got home and guess what's missing! No chicken! Not to mention that only one side of my sandwich was grilled! They must have burnt one side and just replaced it with a piece of un-grilled bread to save time...I understand we went in a little before closing, but for the price of the food, the amount of people there, AND the cook verifying my order you would think they would do better."}
{"text":"Went in around 10AM , I had the place all to my self I got comfortable and 11:ish came around and it got busy, service was great didn't wait long for my food \" I will definitely will go back 
The girls in the front ware friendly, that's always a plus ."}
{"text":"I had heard so many great things about Rachel's Kitchen that I couldn't wait to try it.  Unfortunately my experience was just ok.  The service was extremely SLOW.  I stood in line for quite awhile before my order was taken. The two girls behind the counter took orders, answered phone orders, made smoothies and waitressed food to tables. In my opinion, they were terribly understaffed.  I ordered the cob salad and went and waited for my food. The dining area feels like a fast food establishment. And I waited more.  Finally food.... I liked that the salad was offered with a variety of goodies, garbanzos, bacon, avocado, which seemed fresh and I very much enjoyed. The chicken, however was dried out and I ended up leaving most of it.  Disappointing. Not sure it's worth going back."}
{"text":"I have been going there weekly.  I ordered Lentil soup to go.  When I got home there were no lentils just broth.  So I threw it out.  When I went back asking to be refunded they said no.  I was told the Lentil soup was a puree.  Yet the menu never said that nor I was I told upon ordering.  The owner knew I was a regular yet refused to even offer another soup at no cost.  And worse I order several to go items each time I'm there.  I spend at least 40.00 per visit.  I'll never walk thru their doors again.  They do not respect their customers nor take responsibility for an accurate menu."}
{"text":"I had heard nothing but good things about Rachel's Kitchen. So, when a friend suggested we grab lunch there after a hike in Red Rock Canyon, I was sold.

I never realized it was counter service, but I don't mind a bit if it's it fresh and tasty. I was hoping for quick too because I was famished. I had the turkey club, which had smoked turkey, Swiss cheese, avocado, mixed greens, tomatoes and chipotle mayo served on sourdough bread. I wasn't sure which bread to choose so I asked for a recommendation, sourdough it was. 

The bread was really weak. The other sandwich components were fresh and tasty. I wish the mayo had more kick. I really didn't taste any chipotle. Perhaps the avocado overpowered it. It was a fine sandwich, but worthy of a $12 lunch? No. The sweet potato fries on the side were crisp and delicious. The highlight really.

I have faith that Rachel's Kitchen is dishing out better options than the Smoked Turkey Sandwich so I wouldn't hesitate to return. Next time, I'll likely try a salad. Those looked wonderful."}
{"text":"While traveling through Las Vegas for business I came across this great gem.  I grabbed a juice between appointments as well as some snacks for my meeting. The juice was fresh and the snacks were a wonderful mix of healthy sweets that didn't last long when they hit the table. Service was quick, friendly and made it easy to pop in and out."}
{"text":"The food is healthy and delicious! They have artwork for sale which is super cool. The staff is VERY friendly & informative."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The atmosphere is very fresh and vibrant. The food is amazing. The restaurant itself is very healthy, so you will find healthy and filling meals. They have everything from freshly pressed juices, smoothies, yogurt parfaits, sandwiches, wraps, pastas, breakfast - anything you feel like eating, you can find it here and it will be a healthy alternative! They only use natural and hormone-free chicken breast which I personally love. My favorites on the menu are the 440 sandwich, the fettuccine Alfredo and their salads (can't go wrong with anything you order though.) This place will not disappoint! I will continue to bring friends and family. Service is prompt as well! Even if they are slammed, it doesn't take me more than 15 mins to get my meal. Also, I have to shout out the owner - he is a doll! Stay cool and keep smiling! (Much love from the Costco girl! :)"}
{"text":"It looks cool in the reviews but the over look is very cafeie, the drink are nice but unless its happy hour they are over priced for a mimosas and some wines, the food is worth it not bad considering the area caters to tourist and the \"Ogden\" residents"}
{"text":"This is a great spot, mostly because when I was sitting outside enjoyng my lunch, I didn't feel like I was in Las Vegas.  There were young families and folks with their dogs and it was so nice to not feel like I was at a \"Vegas\" place.  The food is really good too.  I had a really good turkey club sandwich with crispy bacon and avocado.  The mixed green side salad had a flavorful vinigarette.  The menu has a lot of healthy variety that includes breakfast, smoothies, sandwiches, pasta and salads.  
The inside is small, but there are are also a handful of outside tables where you can do some nice people watching.  
I was staying at the Green Valley Ranch and this was just across the street - a really nice way to get out of the casino / hotel."}
{"text":"First thing first  !!!! I was recommended by Juan Morales the kitchen manager , my best worker i ever had , i don't have to  think it twice , we went this Sunday morning .the place it's pretty nice , super clean , they have nice music , TV , the patio is really nice with water fall , pet friendly , they have beer , wine , mimosas , smoothies , fresh juices , more than 5 different coffees , pretty good stuff  My mom had a scramble tomato's and basil and a energizer  and she loved it,  she's in love with this place now ,, i ordered a protein lover with egg whites and it was so delicious . we definitely coming back ........'
what else you need ? 
Healthy food 
Fresh juices 
Great smoothies 
Daly specials 
Caterings 
Preferred cards 
Plus a great customer service . 
I highly recommend this place  

Thanks Rachel kitchen !!!!"}
{"text":"Love Rachel's for breakfast and salads for lunch. Several healthy options.  The only thing I beg of is to step up their acai bowl game! There's so much potential there.  Come on Rachel, you're better than a little acai drenched in granola"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The food is fantastic. Service is usually fast but at sometimes can be slower than desired. The smoothies and juices are wonderful and fresh. Unfortunately the prices are pretty high. I get that the food is fresh and \"high quality\" it most certainly tastes high quality but it's still very expensive. The location has tricky parking, and the interior of the very modern and clean. Overall wonderful restaurant!

Edit: the fries here aren't that good. Not very crispy. Instead I suggest the onion rings. They are nice and crispy! Not really a bad thing for bad fries, but a plus for onion rings."}
{"text":"I'm a simple man. I like dark-haired women and breakfast food. Great hostess and staff, 10/10 would eat here again."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!  Fabulous menu, fantastic service and outstanding food.  I had the tuna sandwich which was absolutely delicious.  Will definitely be back and highly recommend.  Thank you for a great meal!"}
{"text":"The first time I ordered from here I got the Cobb salad and it was amazing. The second time I thought I'd try something different and got the curry salad, and to say the least, very disappointed. The chicken is good chicken, but the salad was plain lettuce and tomato with a vinaigrette dressing (which I thought was weird) and it did not go well with the curry chicken. Also, they added raisins to the chicken with onions, which made it sweet. It was just not good and quite frankly I wish I could get my money back (11-12 dollars for that thing). Regret it."}
{"text":"We took my two young children and some friends after the gym and were the only ones in the place. Had the protein scramble, and an Acai smoothie. Both were delicious. The wife was unhappy with here overly greasy grilled cheese.  The kids had chocolate chip pancakes which were slightly burnt on the bottom and macaroni and cheese which was good. I liked the food and would give it a shot during a busy time to see how they'd fare. The food came out quick too. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Nice place set in a nice area to hang out and walk around, good place to take the kids for breakfast and the food is good.

Took us a while to find it first, it's very easy to miss as it's in The District and has just a small sign.  The restaurant inside is large enough to handle the patrons and has ample outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Visited Rachel's for the first time ever on 1-16-2013 for breakfast with my wife.  Service was not the best, in fact, counter girl had somewhat of an attitude.  Ordered a burrito and a wrap.  When the food came, my wife asked for extra salsa and the same counter girl only offered us hot sauce.  So much for that...so the food to our taste was a little dry.  I was surprised to find Scotch tape on the paper wrapper on my wrap.  All the serving cups are advertising franchise opportunities...a little tacky I thought.  Next time they might be advertising for a lawyer...Need a Check?

All in all, ok.  I would much rather go to Jamms or Babycakes."}
{"text":"Normally I would give Rachel's a great review.  However, the last 2 times I have been to the one in Summerlin at the Trails the service has been terrible.  Had to wait 40 minutes to get my take out order which was a sandwich and chips.  Watched the workers at the counter run around like chickens with their heads cut off.  They couldn't keep orders straight, had a number of people asking for their orders after having to wait like I did.  Very dis organized.  And to top it off, they ran out of the chicken salad so I had to order something else.  Will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I stopped by last week after the gym to grab a smoothie i got the hawaiian bliss it was bomb. The prices here are fairly reasonable aswell. The environment here was pretty chill and pretty clean. What really stood out to me was there customer service. Tatiana helped me out and gave me a good recommendation she was also really nice. Forsure one of the better places in this area i'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Staff is amazing. Food is always good. The manager Efren is attentive to the customers and makes sure everyone is taken care of."}
{"text":"Rachels is just ok. I think of it as pricey cafeteria food. I've had multiple salads and the best one is the Cobb. The others are lacking ingredients. The wraps are also good but not great. The best one to me is the chicken Caesar."}
{"text":"I went to Rachel's Kitchen (RK) with a group of friends. We were meeting for brunch and it seemed a great place to eat something not terrible for us and catch up. I'd been hearing about RK and I suppose I came in with some level of expectation. Those in my party all loved their meals. Really loved. So much so that they suggested returning in a few weeks. I kept tasting my 2 hard scrambled eggs, thin toast, and dried potatoes thinking I was missing something. What we're they tasting that I wasn't? And then I tasted the breakfast wrap and was convinced this was not the place for me.  Again with the hard eggs only this time in a flavorless wrap. The food was overly simple and should have been piping hot and better seasoned. It was none of those things. I just found it to be dull. 

I'm glad there are many more \"better for you\" food options in town, but taste has got to part of the equation for me. I'm no great cook, but when I'm stabbing at my plate thinking about how I can make much better eggs and potatoes at home, it's time for me to walk away."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place.  We had breakfast there, and were not at all impressed by the food or the service."}
{"text":"I went Sunday morning to get a good breakfast,I ordered pancakes and coffee,Such a disappointment,coffee tasted like water and pancakes were raw.Everything bland and tasteless.
I never go back."}
{"text":"So I'm new to this Yelp thing, but decided it's time to write some long overdue reviews on some of my favorite places since I use Yelp all the time to find tasty foods in nearby and far-away lands!

I've eaten at this Rachel's Kitchen several times since it opened a few months ago.  I generally stop in when I'm downtown for a business meeting or to meet with the City or County.  Usually I just pop in for a quick smoothie since they're so good, but twice now I've found myself there around the lunch hour.  The place has a decent lunch crowd and it seems a steady flow of people ordering take-out.  I even noticed they have little delivery bikes out front! Very cool...unique to Vegas for sure!  Anyhow, both lunches I've gotten sandwiches (once the 440 and once the curry chicken salad) and both were excellent, with the 440 being a new favorite I find myself craving.  I got sweet potato fries on the side both times.  They get em crispy here and just ever so lightly salt them with what looks to be like coarse sea salt or something like that.  Maybe I'm the only one that pays attention to things like that??

Everything I've ordered has seemed very fresh and made with good ingredients.  Maybe some of the other reviewers caught them on an off day or when they were just getting momentum, but after stopping in here about 10 times, it's been very consistent for me.

On my next trip, I hope to give the mac-n-cheese a try...I saw someone eating it and it looked great!  I'm a sucker for a good mac-n-cheese!"}
{"text":"Justin and Abby were super helpful! Love the Cobb Salad here, the thing is massive. Tried a lemon bar while i was waiting for takeout and it was awesome."}
{"text":"This is our first time here. It's rather strange that it's part of the hotel, but it's for anyone, not just the hotel patrons. My son had the sautéed mushroom burger and it was fabulous. I had the turkey avocado sandwich. We both had the sweet potato fries, which we were happy they had in the menu. Everything was fantastic. Clean and great staff. Just wish the sweet potatoes were bigger portions."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken sandwich and it was so good! The only complaint would b that the restaurant is small and seating is tight.  I would definitely order food here again, but probably for take out."}
{"text":"This place was just OK. It was quite pricey and the pancakes tasted the same as any other place. I didn't like how my bacon was burned to a point were it was bitter and that they still served it to me like that. When I got up to return it, the guy in the front didn't seem to care although he ordered me another set. I don't see myself returning mainly because I didn't see anything special there or cared much for their service."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant and was very disappointed. Firstly, we weren't greeted as we walked through the doors. It was close to closing time but we still had at least an hour. As we were deciding on what to order, two more groups of people walked in. (They weren't greeted as well). Everyone was undecided. Finally we were ready and I let the cashier Yesenia know. She ignored me. Then I spoke a little louder thinking maybe she didn't hear me. We ordered a mushroom burger and fettuccine alfredo with chicken, and two watermelon juices. The cashier Yesenia looked back at the juicer and then said, \"the juicer isn't working right now.\" When I can clearly see it was taken apart to be cleaned and she didn't want to clean it or juice our drinks. Which was pretty upsetting. So we went with just food. The other two groups then ordered and another person walked in and ordered. Now am I not only upset about not being able to have a fresh juice because of pure laziness, we received our food last when we ordered first. The food was good but I'm not happy with this experience and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Place is ok. Had to ask twice for small things like extra butter and jam. The WifI also did not work  It is dog friendly on the patio. The food was nothing to rave about, pretty basic."}
{"text":"I've been here close to 30 Xs in the last 6 months and always have a good experience. Sometimes the food would take a little long or they'll forget to put a salad dressing in the bag but the quality of the food, cleanliness, and friendly staff are always on point. I recently noticed my rewards weren't tracking and reach out the the corporate office which gave me credit for all of my purchases. I love Rachels!

Favorite dishes: Cobb salad and turkey burger"}
{"text":"One of my top choices in Las Vegas for a fresh, tasty, and healthy meal. 

They also have smoothies, fresh juices, and pastries that are out of this world! 

So lucky to have this location at The Ogden downtown...really made a difference in my decision to move here."}
{"text":"Love the food and smoothies. My local spot! The wine is a plus! Great service and the patio is nice."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Rachel's kitchen. I love the location of this one, with the option of sitting on the patio overlooking the district. Staff is also friendly, and no matter what I order, I know it'll be yummy! My favorites are the Chinese Chicken salad and the wilshire smoothie!! Also, do not skip out on the sweet potato fries, they're delicious. Rachel's is always my go-to."}
{"text":"They advertise vegan but there's nothing that's vegan other than
 a bowl of lettuce. Forget about getting anything quickly even a  smoothie 20 minutes minimum... Really bummed..."}
{"text":"Rachel doesn't season her food 

Rachel over prices her food for the plain blane white folk food they offer - eggs super plain and wet when i ordered them scrambled well. Potatoes where simple fried and dry no seasoning. Tortilla wasn't warmed before hand so it tasted like it was right out the plastic bag.

Since when is salsa - pico de gallo? and you literally get half of a quarter spread of  avocado on the breakfast burrito 

For a breakfast burrito & bacon i paid 15 bucks and it was a waste i literally went to mcdonald's right after.

Their juices & smoothies seemed legit but over all waste of money and Rachel needs a spice carousel"}
{"text":"Last time I order a cesar salada ( no chicken ) and it was so good and huge portion to feed to people at a great price , then this week I order a pasta ( can't remember the name ) but it had egg plant , chicken , sun dried tomatoes on a creamy sauce and let me tell you .... it was delicious !!!!!!! I felt like I was at a Italian restaurant  I got full before I can finish and I still had so much left so I took it home   but again it was great price and big portion and their smoothies are a must too , the rest of the family enjoyed their lunch as well so definitely this is a place to try !!! So healthy and delicious"}
{"text":"The food was just average. The ingredients were fresh, but the tastes were  not outstanding.  The portions were good. The Cobb salad was packed with chicken, bacon, egg. The pasta was kind of heavy. It's a comfortable place to sit & eat a meal. It was more expensive than I would have thought for a casual restaurant. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it was ok."}
{"text":"For airport food this was pretty good...
The breakfast sandwich was a little cheesy and greasy for my taste - but it did keep me full for my entire 4 hour flight. 

The fresh squeezed juices and the coffee were both great.

The service was some of the nicest I've ever received in an airport. I usually experience rather surly service at airports. Not here!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! I eat here often and try something new on the menu every time. I've never been disappointed, everything has delicious!! So many healthy options as well as some indulgences ;) Friendly staff!! Use the app for easy ordering and pick up."}
{"text":"Great smoothies and juices. Not everything on the menu is totally \"healthy\" so the non-healthnuts will enjoy from their selection also. I have gotten chicken sandwiches and wraps and soup their as well. I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Phenomenal brunch int the district at Rachel's Kitchen. Thank you to the amazing staff for the incredible food!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat brunch at. Very friendly staff that is always helping and making sure you are satisfied! Vanessa is one of the best workers !"}
{"text":"The best lunch we get downtown arrives on a bicycle delivery basket. Perfect lunch food...not too heavy, not too light. Prices fair. We think the best thing about this lunch place is the fact the food is made from all fresh, high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I like Rachel's very much!  they have a nice selection of sandwiches, soups & salads, as well as smoothies.  Last visit I ordered the Club and it was huge, with lots of nice sliced turkey and bacon & avo.  I couldn't eat the whole thing!  The atmosphere is a little plain, but fine - comfortable and bright.  I think they have free Wi-Fi.  You order at the counter, and then they bring your food to the table.  It's a little pricey, but it is good quality.  The staff have always been very friendly.  A nice place!"}
{"text":"Here having breakfast with my friend having mimosas the best service Karen, Mia, and Vanessa awesome customer service"}
{"text":"This is the yummiest little spot for vegetarians, vegans, and clean eaters! It's well-priced, fast, and friendly! I shared the acai bowl and a veggie sammie with fresh watermelon juice!

The ciabatta bread is one of the best I've had! its so soft and served warm it was delicious so if you're ordering a sammie and you have options for bread id definitely get that!

Also, the acai bowl is more filling and substantial than most I've had. It had a lot of berries and granola with the acai so it would make a great little breaky in the morning too.

Lastly, the watermelon juice! It's so simple but they do it so well. It's so sweet (but don't worry, no sugar added!) and refreshing. I ordered one large and they split it into two smaller cups and added light ice and it was basically full!

Rachel's kitchen is such a pleasant little stop of a quick bite!"}
{"text":"They're always nice here and I like eating food that tastes fresh. This is the only place by where I live that is consistently good!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites! Rachel's is incredible. It's a place with nothing but good vibes. Service is good. This is your ideal lunch date or cute Sunday brunch spot. The food is healthy and always delicious. Be sure to try the roasted veggie and chicken salad...you'll thank me later ;)"}
{"text":"First time here...


The only reason I am giving it a 3 and not a 5 is because of my 1 question I had for the cashier.

The first male cashier I asked a question to about the Mac and Cheese was VERY helpful. And answered all my questions. 

The actual cashier who took our order GAVE me the wrong info.

I DO NOT EAT ANY FROZEN french fries , due to the fact that they have dextrose in them.

When I asked the cahier are the FF, frozen or fresh cut she said fresh. 
Indeed they WERE NOT. 

The atmosphere was nice , and the food was good.

But if your going to be a considered a HEALTHY restaurant you may want to use FRESH FF. 
The frozen have ALLOT of bad sugars.

I know it is more trouble , but better quality.

I think you may of just lost a customer.

If your FF are not fresh and NOT organic , how do I know ALL your other food is the same.

Sorry guys. I used to own a restaurant , I know what it is like..

There for  being married to a chef of 25 years for 13 years.  

I know good food."}
{"text":"I just love Rachel kitchen mainly because of their quality of food and menu has a little bit of everything from the protein breakfast to the bacon burgers,salad and angel hair pasta bolognese my whole family eats here at least once a week."}
{"text":"The hawian bliss smoothie was good, some what disapointed they did not have pickles for my burger and it was rather dry... guess its not much of a burger place... grabed some pear muffins for my roomate, picked off a small nibble, and it was quite good... will try breakfast next time..."}
{"text":"I'm normally a fan of Rachel's Kitchen, but tonight I was served 3 onion rings as a side dish. They were delicious, don't get me wrong, but for the price I expect a bit more."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite. Half price mimosas for Sunday brunch. Vast menu with choices for every taste. Staff can come across as uninterested."}
{"text":"Went to Rachels for Mothers Day....although there is not much seating inside we managed to snag a spot! My boyfriend and I ordered the breakfast burrito, french toast and watermelon juice! The French was fantastic and came with a side of fruit :) The burrito was good but would have tasted way better with bacon!! Im craving another watermelon juice as I type this!!! Will def be going back!"}
{"text":"Coffee update!!!! This location now sells Peets Coffee!!! Blows Starbucks away, no need to go there first. Rachels is your one stop for all your meals."}
{"text":"Excellent menu choices, fresh produce, delicious juices and smoothies, amazing people working there.  

I get a Sweet Greens juice every time..my absolute favorite.  This lemony juice packed with greens will kickstart your day!  The acai bowl is craveable(best granola ever!),  the veggie burger is one of my favorites, and the veggie sandwich is healthy, tasty, and fulfilling.  As vegetarians, we are always satisfied by our healthy choices. The other menu items look fresh and tasty also!  

The patio is lovely and the atmosphere is inviting.   The staff and owner are top notch.  If you haven't been, go there.  If it's been a while...go back and have a bite.  You will not be disappointed.   Oh!  And beer, wine and mimosas available now too!!"}
{"text":"Always fresh food and great service with a wonderful vibe, whether you're eating inside or out on the patio."}
{"text":"My company's office is located in downtown Las Vegas, and we regularly eat out at restaurants in the area. Rachel's Kitchen is our go-to spot for a healthy, yet tasty lunch that does not hurt your wallet. The location is convenient for meetings, and we love having the option of delivery (by bike!). 

A few of our favorites include the Protein Lover's Scramble, the Arugula Pear Salad, and ALL of their juices and smoothies.  If you have not tried them, we recommend you do so! 

In addition to making great food, Rachel's also provides outstanding support for our local nonprofits, and we appreciate what they do for the downtown community. Thank you Rachel's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"I was at the District shopping and wanted to grab some lunch. I was really excited that Rachel's Kitchen had gluten-free items. 

Went in with my mom and had the gluten free \"Breakfast Sandwich,\" watermelon juice, acai bowl, and a hot tea. 

The Breakfast Sandwich was good. It was two slices of gluten free bread, a two egg white scramble with basil and tomatoes. 

The acai bowl was not good. It was more like liquid than a solid. It tasted like banana more than acai. Also there is no gluten free granola so it was only acai/ banana liquid with a few strawberries. I wouldn't recommend getting it. 

The watermelon juice was yummy and the hot tea was fine. 

Overall, I like the place. It didn't knock my socks off for breakfast but they get major props for having delicious gluten free bread. 

I'll have to go back and see how their pastas and lunch menu items are."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was a good experience i well come back agin. Came in yesterday with my daughter we shared the turkey club sandwich with sweet potatoes fries both was great nice place and the food came fast and they employees where very nice"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's good quality, well cooked casual options with gluten free dishes too.  The gluten free options are especially good.  Highly recommend.  Service is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Wow I hope the food is better then the wait...me and my wife ordered 2 things scrambled eggs and French toast... It took well over 20mins...and there was about 7 cooks back there and nobody waiting in front of us...their excuse was they were preparing for some catering event...this allows me to assume that the management sucks...if you have 7 cooks in the kitchen and a ticket comes in as easy as scrambled eggs and French toast... And it takes 20 minutes that means someone is not delegating priority properly...

But its a nice place...the host was nice...but I would come back just to see if it happens again..."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food! Not the service! My food was yummy today! Got the pancakes with banana and I was pleased. Unfortunately, I will not come back to this location. I'm not sure why, but the hualapai and DI location is the only one that knows how to balance food quality and service. Been to this location three times now and service is just eww. I thought maybe my other visits were on \"bad days\"; however, I'm sure that's not the case. Slow food and staff here so don't be alarmed. I understand it takes time for the food to be prepared, but how long does it take to say \"Hello! Thanks for coming to Rachel's kitchen...how can I help you [without a perturbed visage]\" Not sure because I had to get the gals at the fronts attention...& I was never greeted or acknowledged, so someone let me know. I will go out of my way to hualapai and DI from now on."}
{"text":"I love Rachael's kitchen! You can't really go wrong anything you decide to order here! This is the best out of all the locations, btw. Nice environment and the taste is consistent  rather than some other locations. Today unfortunately I will say they messed up my To go order. Didn't notice until I was home and there was no going back. So I guess I'll say, check your order before you go because they won't."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, so many healthy choices and some not so healthy, it's perfect anybody can find something to eat, their juices (I have tried them all) are so good, and the smoothies, so tasty (I have also tried them all), it's my to go place everyday for lunch. Great burgers, amazing sandwiches, you can choose the kind of bread you want, they even have gluten free bread, big and plentiful salads, big breakfast.  I just love it."}
{"text":"Wasnt sure what to eat, but after checking out the menu we decided to try this place. It's located in the GVR shopping plaza.

Favorite thing is they offer breakfast all day...since its also my favorite meal of the day I knew we would workout.

One lame thing is the check in offer. The way it's worded is you get 50% off beer and wine. Turns out its only advertising for the deal they already have...aka happy hour m-f 4-6pm. 

I had the favorite. It's a scrabble with goat cheese and roasted tomatoes and avacado (my fav). Comes with a side of potatoes-9.75. Next time, I wanna try the acai bowl! -6.95

My husband got the meat lovers. It's cheesy with bits of bacon and chicken. He said he would get mine next time. 

We will be back, and trying different things"}
{"text":"We ordered a coffee latte and it tasted like milk only.
We asked to make more coffee taste, they charged their mistake. 

Very unprofessional attitude toward their milk taste coffee. Use some more dark grinds !!!"}
{"text":"Love to eat at Rachel's, but won't be going back again. Why is that places have to take advantage of locals pockets to be healthy. I think it's wrong to charge a $1.50 extra for egg whites and a additional $1.50 for replacing bacon for turkey bacon. It added an almost extra $7 to the bill for 2 people. The egg whites was what really got me though. I can go to plenty of other fantastic local restaurants that won't take advantage of being a healthy person."}
{"text":"Clean, fun colors, fun atmosphere. Good place to meet a friend, which is what I was doing. Fun fresh, healthy choices, and not boring."}
{"text":"Vanessa and the team was extremely pleasant!! Will come back as often as possible. Enjoyed the food and the service!"}
{"text":"Was just driving around when I saw this place.
BBQ wrap was very good....barely gave me any French fries though!! Got a smoothie as well that was good...not worth the $17 I paid though!"}
{"text":"I love this place !!great service and food is always amazing :]]] I love stoping by right after work, it always hits the spot. Great for ordering lunch for the whole office."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch yesterday. I work across the street, which is convenient. The place was very clean. The service was quick and easy. 
The food was delicious. My burger had great flavor, juicy and cooked to order. The french fries perfectly seasoned and crispy. My smoothie was perfect and cold. I like the outdoor seating. The weather is still nice enough to eat outdoors.  
I look forward to going again."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  We waited 40 minutes to get our food.  When it finally arrived it was cold.  There was only 1 other table when we arrived.  While we there the place filled up.  It seemed like the kitchen was not prepared for a rush. Next time we will go back to Mr. Mama's."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is always a good go-to. Sometimes, I wish the tables were a little cleaner but I know they get busy in between crowds.

This last time I went, the guy at the register was really helpful and I liked his substitute suggestion for the juice that I got. 

Food is always fresh and yummy - lots of fun spins on lighter options.

This location has good outdoor seating and some quiet spaces inside, although sometimes the tables feel too close together."}
{"text":"I had Rachel's Kitchen cater an open house/brunch for close to 100 people last weekend. Let me tell you..Tony, the manager, was FANTASTIC in handling everything we needed. I met with him about 2 weeks before the event to select the menu. His recommendations for food, the quantity, and presentation was spot on!  I ordered both from the breakfast menu for my early arrivers and from the lunch menu for my guests that arrived later in the afternoon. Tony delivered the food in two shift to make sure that it arrived and stayed hot. The food was exceptional!!  We had eggs, potatoes , bacon, French Toast(amazingly good!), breakfast wraps, sandwiches, salads, pasta, fruit salads and desserts. He also included paper goods, napkins, and utensils!  My guests would not stop raving about the food!  I would highly recommend using Tony and Rachel's Kitchen for an event!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed by the menu options, the food quality and the service.  You order at the counter and either wait for Take-out or sit down and have them bring it to your table.
This place is good if you are looking for quality salads, wraps, sandwiches or smoothies.  Their baked goods look great as well.
This is located about a block off Fremont, in the Ogden building.  Clean, bright and away from the Fremont chaos and weirdness.  Expect about $8-$10 for sandwiches and $5 for a smoothie.  A nice smoothie bonus is that you may add protein for $1."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken Caesar Wrap and it was DELICIOUS! So good I couldn't finish it! They threw in a special sauce that mixed the chicken and lettuce perfectly! Definitely recommend if you are looking for something healthy but yummy! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Very affordable breakfast. We ordered the Breakfast Wrap and Breakfast Burrito, $7 something each. The food is AVERAGE. 

The menu is very big, you will find something you like.

The juice selection is amazing, except they do not have orange juice (weird!).

We ordered a large watermelon juice $5 - SUPER AMAZING."}
{"text":"My first time here was on a saturday, during a musical live performance (I didnt plan it, just happened) I must say, that it was just delighful to listen to nice music while eating delicious food. Definitely nice place to go anytime of the day! Also the attention was perfect!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. I've gotten the Chinese chicken salad which is really good! But, extremely over priced. $14? It's not worth that much. Today, though, I got the acai bowl. Super small portion & the price wasn't too bad. Definitely lacking flavor though. As for customer service, it's not that great. I don't think any of the employees want to be there. Didn't really get a good vibe. I never do. All in all, food is okay, it's over priced & I'm not a fan of the customer service."}
{"text":"Been back many times since the original review. The expansion is great, so glad to have more space. The food is still amazeballs. Ended up speaking with the owner by chance who was taking our order (when does that ever happen these days?!!). Talked at length about his place and how they have big plans with The District (farmers markets!). Very cool guy. Now if only we could do something about the dang kids running around all the time and the draft that comes through the front door (find a seat inside to the right to avoid it btw)

Oh and how could I forget... $3 Mimosas on Sunday!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to lunch here on Sunday with a pretty large party. It's hard to eat with a large group because you can't please everyone... but this place was a hit with us all! Some of us ordered breakfast, and others ordered lunch. Portions were perfect, the food was spectacular! Personally, I ordered a turkey sandwich on gluten free bread with sweet potato fries. The bread was amazing and so were the fries. It tasted very fresh and healthy. I can't wait to try the other locations."}
{"text":"This place is super clean and good. It is definitely a more healthy place they have juices, salads, breakfast and sandwiches. If you have not given Rachel's kitchen a try. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always fresh, and terrific, the staff is friendly.  They are a great alternative to fast food, it is healthy, and the protein smoothies are awesome, try the peanut butter blast! It is out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"Mom loves the Turkey Club.  Dad wasn't impressed with the BBQ Bacon Burger.  It was dry, dad said, 'where's the beef' and wasn't fond of the BBQ sauce.  My 440 Chicken sandwich was super dry.  Also the goat cheese was not flavorful on it.  I needed to ask for a side of dressing to swallow it on the ciabatta bread.  

I've been going to Rachel's since day one, but ALWAYS get the Chicken Chopped Salad, or Turkey Club with sweet potato fries... Amazing!!  All four of us had soggy sweet potato fries.  The Turkey Club as always gets 5 stars, but as a restaurant that I love, I don't always want to order the same two items.  Earlier this year I tried a breakfast omelette that I wasn't impressed with, but thought, maybe breakfast isn't the way to go so I stuck to the same lunch items next time.  I wasn't yelping at the time.  

Posting pictures of my favorite CHOPPED CHICKEN SALAD & TURKEY CLUB!!  I highly recommend.  

I am rating only three stars because it's my third time ordering something new & not impressed with.  If I stuck to my original favorites I'd give a 5 star, but expect more from Rachel's. The menu is simplistic and I believe can be better than that, especially when it comes to a chicken sandwich on ciabatta and a bacon burger.  

Yesterday, September 27th 5pm the employees were wonderful, they get 5 stars.  I will be back to try something new again, hopefully or go back to usual the Chopped Chicken Salad.  Also checking in w/ an entree gets you a free glass of wine."}
{"text":"Rachel's is a great place to go for any meal! I love their Chinese chicken salad and the Signature pasta!! Their smoothies are delicious as well! My favorite is the Sunrise!! Not only do they have amazing food, they have great service. Everyone there is so friendly and ready to accommodate any needs you have! 
Delicious food and friendly customer service; what more you ask for? :D"}
{"text":"I had Ultimate Grilled Cheese on sourdough with fries (similar to McDonalds (unsalted) it was tasty, my wife had to 440 - she said it was \"ok\". I like that they serve Breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"Love this place - i always get the veggie chicken salad and carrot juice.  - a lot of healthy choices :) the customer service is really good here too."}
{"text":"Love all the salad choices here. You can also choose to add protein to your salads.
My favorite is the Arugula Pear!
Everything is super fresh and I love their Sweet Greens fresh squeezed juice.

Everything I have had here has been amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing....this would be a 5 star review for the health conscious costumer. Me? My taste buds do the rating.    3.5 stars.
  This is how it happened. I was dragged into this little place by a calorie counter, I watch what I eat, blah blah conscious friend that spends half of his life at the gym and reads every label or ingredient on anything he eats. Well I'm the opposite, the only times I go to the gym  is the day after my yearly doctors check up, the day my yearly membership is due and when I have plumbing problems at home and I need to take a shower. As for labels, I don't have time for that , I use common sense.  Good for you = tasteless, bad for you = delicious. So when my friend told me how this place serves very healthy options I was wishing I would've went to lunch with my fluffy friend instead.
  I ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and I was happy with it, not bad at all. It was rich and creamy and servings are large enough for two meals. My friend ordered a turkey sandwich and French fries. Yes, French fries, I don't get it either, but my friend explained to me that even with the fries, he was eating healthier than at any other comparable restaurant and that my pasta had too many calories, so I told him that I wanted to go to lunch not to a nutritionist. He shut up and I enjoyed my pasta.
  So if you want to go to a place that serves food that  makes you feel like you're eating healthy, Rachel's kitchen is the place to go!  The place is small and always busy  but I notice that you can fit more people here than at any regular McDonald's. Hmmm, maybe they are right. Maybe this food is really  good for you, everyone around here seems to be in shape...cool, another reason for me to skip the gym...I'll just go to Rachel's kitchen."}
{"text":"Yum! The Acai bowl here is tasty. They purée bananas with acai to form the base. There's also yummy granola and some chewy dried fruits too to give it some texture."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always good and the service is friendly and accommodating. I recommend their Acai bowls!"}
{"text":"Dominic? I believe his name is. Very informative and knowledgable on the menus. Has helped me make a great decision each time. Smoothie was amazing and so was the bbq wrap."}
{"text":"Don't know what all the hype is, Rachel's isn't good.  Been there 3 times and this is my last.  They say Albacore Tuna, I don't agree and it's filled with carrots, celery and whatever else, very bland and tasteless. I also think the turkey is processed.  The prices are high for what you get.  Everyone there is Hispanic they're speaking back and forth in Spanish not paying attention to the customers and not nice.  I have never been greeted nor thanked for my business.  Too bad I work in the building next door and it sure would be convenient.  Too bad Rachel!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend, will not return. Steer clear.

Ordered the French Toast and Bacon.

The bread they use for the French Toast has a tougher crust, so a lot of the batter didn't absorb into the bread. Making each bite kind of half bread, half french toast. It also wasn't cooked properly and had some parts which were basically just batter soaked bread.

The Bacon was cold and obviously not made to order. 

Sidenote: While I was waiting (which was a little longer than normal for breakfast) a lady cancelled her order because it took too long to come out."}
{"text":"This review is for the Downtown/Ogden location only.

Today I ordered lunch for my office.  We order for pick-up or delivery from this location at least once or twice weekly.  The service is always wonderful and you'll always get a smile whether you are in the restaurant or order delivery.

I ordered a Chicken Finger Wrap with onion rings and a Sweet Greens Juice.  Today's portion size was laughable.  There was more wrap than filling and only THREE onion rings.  THREE!!!  

A coworker mirrored my order and also had only THREE onion rings in her meal as well.  She was also unhappy with her wrap.  This got us talking...most of us have noticed a decline in food quality and quantity from this location.  Very dissapointing.  We all love Rachel's and will continue to order for lunch but I hope this review is read and the concerns addressed.  

We will give it a couple more tries but at this point there are too many other options to settle for an unsatisfactory lunch no matter how nice the employees are."}
{"text":"4 stars for cleanliness and food quality. 
3 stars for price for what you get. 

I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and felt like I should do yoga for the rest of the week. This place is a cute, neighborhood eatery. It has a casual patio sitting area (the inside is small). 
I like all the choices they have for breakfast and lunch. 
Apparently, the pasta there is the best, so will have to try that next time. 

My sandwich did come out a little burnt, no biggie, but would stock up on better bread for any and all sandwiches. 

If you're in the area worth the try!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches!  Just needed something healthy and light, and asked what would fit the bill. The vegetarian sandwich was recommended, and I endorse it fully. The vegetables were freshly roasted, the ciabatta was fresh, and the sweet potato fries hit the spot. Perfect place for a great sandwich. Would def go there again."}
{"text":"Awesome food that tastes good and is good for you. They also make great juices. I recommend the Popeye's Secret. Nice staff as well. Outdoor seating will be nice in the Fall."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast I had a turkey avacodo sandwich with delicious breakfast potatoes. Service is outstanding they take care of you a lot."}
{"text":"Loved this cafe! It's a great breakfast & brunch spot to hit up! I ordered the Sunrise Smoothie and thought it tasted a little bitter. Almost like it needed more sugar! Wish I would have tasted a better smoothie!"}
{"text":"They are awesome here, great food and delicious drinks! I came into town for 2 days,  got sick- they brought my drinks to my Hotel :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a delicious acai bowl from Rachel's Kitchen during a layover. Service was quick and it did not disappoint! Highly recommend and I will be back next time I am at LAS."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! They have the best Acai Bowl and we love their Banana Chocolate Chip Pancakes!"}
{"text":"This place is always a hit or a miss. This is what my take out food looked liked, Burnt fries and over cooked chicken. Not appetizing at all , which is really disappointing. Worse part is I have a ten month old with me so it's not like I'm going to take the time to drive back and have them remake it when she is hungry too and ready for her nighttime routine."}
{"text":"The location is very convenient. The food, however, leaves a bit to be desired. What's more, the prices are a tad high."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service!  My over medium eggs were done correctly. The bacon was great and the potatoes were favorable. Coffee was hot and the water glasses were always full. 

Highly recommended and will visit again."}
{"text":"Rachels is an excellent breakfast spot when u want healthy tasty and fast. Smoothies are great here!! Great service at this location!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! We went there on one of our first dates, made a few more trips, and went back on our one-year anniversary. We love the food, and we always enjoy sitting outside. 

The service is excellent and the people at the counter are always friendly and cheerful. Sometimes it's a little messy inside (like dirty tables), but it's really not bad at all. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I was in a hurry trying to find something healthy and quick to eat before my Pilates class at Galaxy Pilates so I yelped \"sandwich wrap\" nearby. Rachael's kitchen came up and I saw they had several different wraps, BBq chicken being my all time favorite, and they had good reviews so I came in. There was no line and I received my order to go guickly. I ate half my wrap in the car before Pilates class and it was Delicious! The lettuce was crunchy and the bbq sauce was perfect! Right now I'm here again I got the free muffin ( chose blueberry) from checking in to this location on Yelp, then the cashier let me know I can write a review for a free entre?! Dope. Muffin was warned for us, the outside if it was crunchy! Yum! Inside was warm and soft. We also ordered the energizer juice with HEAVY ginger! We got it and could hardly taste any hint of ginger. The lady was very friendly and took it back to put in an extra shot of GInger immediately. Friendly fAst service by all the ladies I've seen working here. Just got served our breakfast burritos. I got mine with egg whites of course :) I love mine. BF said his is \"not bad\" that means good. Good job! Obly downside- the chai latte isn't my favorite. Won't order this again. But A+ for everything else."}
{"text":"I just ordered off the yelp app through grub hub and it was a very easy process! Although they forgot my fruit the bbq bacon burger is to die for!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here, nowadays. I go a few times a week (at least) when I am home in Vegas. The food looks \"real\" - not sure how else to describe it. I'd say the meals are uncomplicated, you an actually see what is in them and how the food is made. You can eat quite healthy here, or go nuts with a gourmet grilled cheese or burger. 

Their burgers are a nice treat on gluten free bread if you can't do the normal bun. The sweet potato fries are damn near perfect. Everything I've ever tried here has been fantastic, including the banana chocolate chip pancakes (I had a \"gluten day\")."}
{"text":"We had been out all day and couldn't agree on what to eat.  This place had items to appease everyone's palate.  The veggie burger is a must!  Staff was really nice and even went above and beyond to ensure that my son had allergy friendly eats."}
{"text":"They deleted my first review because they said it \"wasn't representative of a firsthand experience\"
How's this for a firsthand experience?

I'm over in the South Summerlin area for work and look up what fast-er food options are nearby. Rachel's Kitchen shows up with two $$ on it, meaning it's not super cheap but it shouldn't be ridiculously priced either, so I expected to find something for $6, no drink. That's a reasonable expectation. 
When I get there, the parking is bad because all the spaces are crammed together, making it hard to park the company van (standard sized van mind you, not a giant box truck). 
I go inside and stare at a wall of words and prices that start at $9 each. 
A woman behind the counter asks if I'm ready to order and I say I have no idea because this is my first time and I don't know how it works. 
She then points to another menu, again everything costing $9 or more. 
I fumble around with the menu for a bit then ask \"Do you have anything that's not as expensive?\" whereupon she laughs at me and says \"we have a kids menu...\"
Okay, maybe for other people, that are ordering for children, that would be a good choice. But I'm not a child and don't want to spend $7 on a kids meal that is smaller than the adult portions.

Maybe the food is good, if you want to spring $9 + on a salad. As a poor working man I don't have that kind of money, and I don't appreciate being laughed at for asking for something that is cheaper, and I understand that a kids meal is cheaper, but it is not a substitute for a large mans portion.

Upset with the off-base remark, I left Rachel's Kitchen, walked down the parking lot to Subway and had a sandwich maker who was very polite and respectful. (I got a great subway sandwich at a good price and was treated with respect, where at Rachel's Kitchen I got none of these three.)

Maybe for other people it is a good experience, but for me it wasn't."}
{"text":"Have been to Rachel's Kitchen several times now, and every single time, I like it better. The food is fresh and organic. It's easy to find and get to (ground floor of the Ogden, right across from the El Cortez). The people are always nice. They don't care if you sit for a couple of hours catching up with friends. The menu is reasonably varied, and reasonably priced. It's not cheap fast food...It's quality food, served quickly, at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for breakfast! Fresh friendly and great service! Liked the menu choices and the prices were perfect for what you get! The environment is awesome, happy vibes happy people!"}
{"text":"Always consistently great no matter what I order.  Good, clean food .  Never feel like I have been \"bad\" here.  I had the tuna wrap this time.  Love it."}
{"text":"Great place off the beaten path. Easy walk from Downtown Grand and Fremont Street area."}
{"text":"Great food and choices. Little bit of a wait at lunchtime. Go with a friend!"}
{"text":"Our whole family loves this place. Great food, service and atmosphere. Seem like the place to be for lunch in summerlin. Chicken curry salad is my favorite."}
{"text":"What a gem of a restaurant with good food and the most amazing service. Breakfast and lunch items are good across the menu. Abby and Gabby really made every experience here something special. Any business would be happy to have employees working for them that care as much as these two young ladies."}
{"text":"Usually a restaurant that expands to multiple locations losses its quality, Not here at Rachel's Kitchen. Now it's made easier to enjoy the great freshness wherever you are. I usually find myself ordering the Albacore Tuna sandwich the most, it's just that delicious, but today I got the 440 Sandwich* and I fell in love all over again. I highly recommend this place to all my friends constantly, and no one has been disappointed, and that's including my very hard to please mother :)

*grilled chicken breast, goat cheese, avocado, roasted red peppers, roasted tomatoes & romain lettuce"}
{"text":"Just finished my fourth and last meal here.  Each visit the food and service have steadily gotten worse.  Today the grilled cheese sandwiches were burned, the onion rings were burned and hard, the service was non-existent.  We had to go up and ask for our drinks that were just sitting there getting warm, watched our food just sit while the staffer tried to figure out the order and put it on the tray.
Had to ask for an item we didn't get which was for a toddler who was cranky and hungry.  Then they brought the wrong item and we had to wait longer for the kids meal item.  All of this was done in slow motion.  Staff didn't seem to understand what they were doing or even care about it.

Very frustrating and disappointing since we have enjoyed the food and service at the District location, and were excited to discover this one which is close to home."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times already and felt it's finally time to review.  This place has something for everyone and feels like a farm to table type of place, but I don't think it is because it's a franchise.  I usually go to the one on Hualapai and the setting is quaint with a few chairs in and outdoors to enjoy a meal.

My favorite dish on the menu is the Signature pasta.  Basically it's like a pomodoro pasta with sun dried tomato, eggplant, mushrooms, and chicken.  But you can change to any kind of pasta you like.  A friend likes theirs with Quinoa pasta cuz it's gluten free... 

Other good dishes I've tried include their curry chicken salad sandwich and the arugula pear salad.  The salad is quite lite and the sandwich is on the sweeter side with raisins in it but has a touch of curry powder taste.  

Fresh squeezed drinks are also delicious."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast, the food is outstanding, and the staff was really friendly and helpful.  Love the music playing and the comfortable atmosphere.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick lunch. Soups, salads and sandwiches are their specialty and smoothies and veggie juices compliment the meal. Service staff and always very friendly and helpful. Franchise owner is approachable and willing to get her hands dirty to help. The price is fair for a health food place. Great outdoor patio for nice sunny days in the shade."}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was great! I found myself coming back again and again for more. The lunch dishes and smoothies were great. As time went on food quality went down hill a bit. Last time I went for breakfast was terrible. Eggs were cold and potatoes were soggy. If anything I recommend their sandwiches or wraps. They are pretty good, priced a little high for what they are but not bad for a quick lunch on the go."}
{"text":"If you are health conscious this place is awesome!!!! I have had the turkey burger, cheeseburger, and the breakfast burrito here. I watch my figure very carefully and am very picky about food. I love it here because everything is made so naturally and healthy! You taste the food's natural rich flavors unlike other places where a lot of food is over processed and over seasoned. Great healthy selection! I love this place! Friendly & great staff as well. Clean environment! A+++++!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Henderson,Nevada and a friend recommended Rachael's Kitchen. And I must admit there was no other restaurant, store, or establishment of any kind that beat the friendliness and service at Rachael's Kitchen. 
One woman in specific stood out from the rest, Cynthia, was incredibly helpful and patient with me especially since I had never been to Rachael's kitchen before. The freshly made vegetable juices that she recommended were awesome and tasted delicious. I made sure I went every day of my visit to Rachael's kitchen due to the great energy, atmosphere and wholesome food."}
{"text":"The food at Rachel's kitchen is absolutely phenomenal. I love the atmosphere and professionalism of the staff. I've been eating at this establishment and will keep returning. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Only tried a few smoothies and the chicken caesar wrap...but they were grrrrrrrrrrreat!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to eat but today was a really awkward & uncomfortable experience. I was having lunch with my mom when I couldn't help but notice the staff (this young mexican girl wearing a bun & bald mexican guy with a go-t), talking about every person walking through the door! I looked up from eating my lunch & they were awkwardly staring & laughing at me! I was thinking what the hell? Do they have a problem with me? I refuse to spend my money anymore, at a place were the staff are rude & make the atmosphere of the restaurant uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Such delicious fresh food! This downtown location makes it a prime place to get some healthy food. As most of you know, downtown is known for bar hopping and the famous heart attack grill. So if you're looking for some healthy refreshing food, Rachel's Kitchen is the place to go to make up for all the greasy dining! Great for vegans/vegetarians. 

I was craving some greens and needed something refreshing so I got the Spinach salad: It came with fresh baby spinach. bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, caramelized pecans & goat cheese tossed with lemon herb vinaigrette. You also have the option to add chicken or tuna. I added on the grilled chicken. The salad definitely hit the spot for me. The grilled chicken was perfect, not too dry and it went well with the goat cheese. To be honest, I'm not really a goat cheese/feta cheese kind of person, but it wasn't overwhelming as I expected it to be. There was a balance with all flavors and I appreciated that because I really don't even like dressing on my salad sometimes. 

For beverages I tried the Energizer it comes with beets, apples, carrots, lemon and ginger root. I absolutely love ginger in my juices because it always adds a \"ZING\" to the juice. I recommend this juice for people that aren't really familiar with juicing, its similar to regular juices and doesn't have that (sometimes overwhelming) green plant taste. 

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My co-worker bought me lunch and she got me a Cobb salad and she ordered a Chinease Chicken salad to go. Both salads were delicious! lot's of protein and veggies and very filling!"}
{"text":"Meh. This place is uninteresting and the service was very slow and not very friendly. They weren't mean, but it was morning and I could use some positive vibes.

I had a breakfast burrito. It was good, but not anything special. Plus it took so long that it was cold by the time it hit my table. It wasn't even busy in there so I'm not sure what the hold up was about. My fiance's over easy eggs were a little too runny too.

I like the concept of this place but it really missed the mark. Freshness is good but if I'm going to pay a few extra bucks I'd also like it to taste interesting and not bland.

Giving fresh hippie a bad rep over there."}
{"text":"Loved it! Went here for breakfast. Food was superior and very fresh with a great presentation. The service was outstanding. Very friendly and accommodating. Will definately be coming back."}
{"text":"Friendly service, but the food was terrible. The onion rings and smoothies were pretty good but everything else was pretty bad. My burger was over cooked and over seasoned. My husbands French fries had no salt or flavor. The Hawaiian bliss smoothie was great. We might give this place another shot before we write it off."}
{"text":"Had a BBQ bacon burger, fries, and a yummy cupcake=$15. Pretty good food. Not a very big menu but they had a few other things I would try.

This is a very cute cafe! Friendly staff and overall a good place to meet for lunch."}
{"text":"A healthy Alternative, food is OK have some good selection of sustainable foods more of run of the mill kind of American Foods."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Rachel's kitchen downtown often but first time at this location. Came for lunch and there was no line. Their menu is definitely healthier than most places which is exactly what I was looking for. I got a chicken veggie salad and it was pretty good. The ingredients were all fresh and the vegetables were perfectly roasted. You get a free glass of wine if you check in which I will definitely use next time !"}
{"text":"Later vice is super slow! Came in on a Saturday afternoon at they weren't busy at all. Still took almost 25 min for a smoothie?"}
{"text":"I honestly have never had a bad experience here... My husband and I go all the time. Tonight (9/11/13) we went in at 8:00pm (their website AND store sign say they close at 9:00pm). We walk in (mind you, this is AFTER all the storms have passed through- sky is clear, in fact), there are people who just received their food, and there is another couple that were almost done.. Total of 4 people eating inside. We walk in, and are INSTANTLY (and rudely) told \"were closed due to the storm\" um... WHAT?? What storm. I laugh and say \"you're kidding right? The storm is over\" and once again, the cashier says \"we're closed Due. To. The. Storm. Warning\". So we left. We probably will never go back to this Rachel's Kitchen, or any others. And I will not be recommending this place. It's a shame what customer service has come to. This place ant too special, and I can go down the street, and get the same thing, for less, with better service."}
{"text":"Not impressed. First time here we waited at the counter while they helped other people who came after us!  Several people kept acknowledging us but that was it. T

Next, we had to ask for coffee cups after ordering ... We thought they'd bring our coffee ... Nope. It's self serve. Hello. How does an order taker do that. 

Music too loud. But they turned it down when we asked. Coffees very good, but still waiting on the food."}
{"text":"Great for a light meal. Their sandwiches are very good, and I like the fact they make everything fresh so you can get it the way you want. 
It's attached to a hotel, but a separate entrance. 
The decor is simple, but quite nice. 
Recommended if you are looking for something quick, light and simple."}
{"text":"Big menu. All day breakfast!
I had a sandwich, Turkey club and my wife had the Tuna Salad. 
Both were fresh and very tasty. 
This restaurant is good if you are looking for something a bit lighter."}
{"text":"One of the only fresh cold press juice places I can find in this side of Henderson! Great service. Beautiful place. Highly recommend. Energizer, Caesar salad, and turkey avocado club"}
{"text":"The chicken and the avocado in my Cobb Salad were extremely tough. Not a big fan of writing reviews, but that was bad."}
{"text":"Soooooooooo good. Get the Caesar salad. The atmosphere is relaxing and the location is good. Right next to downtown, but not directly downtown. The Caesar salad was probably one of the better Caesar salads I've ever had and the smoothie was really refreshing too! Great place if you just want something quick and light."}
{"text":"Food isn't tasty but healthy which gives them 4 stars.
The setup is like fast food place.  No servers
Coffee is good
Fresh juice great
Salads better than most food there"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great and so is the staff. Everytime I come here they go over and above exceeding my expectations. Rachel's Kitchen is definitely my fav place to eat."}
{"text":"Our first time to a Rachel's-the chicken wrap was very good! Hamburger was good/ok. Onion rings phenomenal, fries were sparse. Service friendly but the wait was long! I guess that's what you get with fresh food. Prices are pretty standard or a little high, but I'd rather go here any day than get lower quality fast food. I'm sure they allow you to call ahead and order. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy good in an inviting atmosphere. Staff is phenomenal! I had the veggie burger and sweet potato fries and the carrot juice to drink. The carrot juice had just the right amount of sweetness to it! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent salad!!! So fresh and well made! Usually airport food is disgusting and vegetables all are silently rotten in plastic big jars. this place is a hidden gem! highly commended!! Their Ice-T is awfully bitter, it's a matter of personal taste....;) 
+ I took the smoked Turkey and Swiss Sandwich - excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite location , but still the same fresh yummy food! The sandwiches and salads are so delicious. I don't recommend the breakfast burrito as it is just egg and avocado. Their fries are amazing and always remind me of McDonald's. I got a turkey sandwich and it looked pretty basic and plain but surprised me by being really delicious and flavorful!"}
{"text":"I appreciate what Rachel's Kitchen brings to Vegas - really, I do.  Fresh, whole food in a casual atmosphere is just the kind of lunch place that was in demand.  The problem for me is that it's only ok and overpriced.  I mean, I'm ordering a salad or a sandwich at a counter for $10.  Already a little much, the food is just so so for it to be worth the price.  Still, I respect what they're trying to do and I know the Summerlin residents love it."}
{"text":"Their Garden's Pasta is my favorite!! I told the server that I'm addicted to this dish.

Instead of penne, I always ask the chef to use angel's hair. 

Perfect mix of sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, peas, chicken, pesto in the noodles, with some cheese on top. I love it!

Their fresh juices are amazing too, and let's not forget about the super delish pecan bar. 

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"+nice location 
+very nice stuff
+free wifi 
-ordered the vanilla cupcake and it tastes like pure sugar 
-sweet potato fries portion way to small
-salat, spaghetti, scrambled eggs and burger needs more salt, pepper- spices..

All in one its ok here but not for the prices.."}
{"text":"first time trying this place & I had the mushroom melt cheeseburger & skin cleanser juice. I had my order to go.

The burger was good although i wish there was more mushrooms to keep the burger juicy.

The skin cleanser juice surprised me in that it tasted exactly like carrot juice unless that's what it's supposed to taste like. I enjoy fresh juice,but when it tastes like veggies, which i'm not a huge veggie eater i don't personally enjoy it.

I'll try this place out again."}
{"text":"The 440 Sandwich with sweet potato fries is one of my favorite lunches. The salads are also great, and I can't wait to try the pasta dishes (and I will...one of these days).

I really like this location because it seems quicker and less crowded than the one on Hualapai."}
{"text":"I don't understand why they opened an airport location if they aren't going to highlight what they do well. Location limited to a ready-made assortment of sandwiches and salads, none of which are particularly interesting (chicken salad, grilled cheese, Caesar) and made-to-order smoothies. The snack box I purchased (crackers, apple slices, hard boiled egg,  and cheese) had an extremely generous serving of brie, but minimal other items to actually eat it, requiring you to purchase an additional bag of pita chips or pretzels, or let the cheese go to waste. Frankly, the smoothie I had was too runny and lacked flavor. For the same price, I had better (and faster) at the nearby Juice Express. Nonexistent service, employee had zero personality or interest in helping me, making suggestions, or making my smoothie."}
{"text":"We decided to try Rachel's Kitchen for brunch last week while in Vegas and we really enjoyed it! I found it while scrolling Yelp while laying in bed one morning and was intrigued by the raving reviews of the Peanut Butter Blast Smoothie. We thought we best check it out...

The Peanut Butter Blast Smoothie is not to be missed. Wow. We shared one and it was fantastic. Maybe not the \"healthiest\" smoothie I have ever consumed, but hey, were in Vegas, right? I will be back for another next time I'm in Vegas.

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and Heather had the Smoked Turkey & Avacado sandwich with a side green salad. Both were really tasty, nothing out of the ordinary but both very good. The staff here was awesome, and it's a bright, sunny spot to hit on a slow moving Vegas morning."}
{"text":"Nasty!!!!!!! My wife WAS addicted to this place when it first opened but they are opening locations around town so fast that consistency is a major issue. The burgers here taste frozen and cooked too long. When I place an order online I still end up waiting 15 plus minutes for my food after arriving. Seriously, McDs tastes better. My last order was wrong and yet again... Burnt! I will say that the eating area is always clean but the food and service should be more on par."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is really good. My husband and I always leave satisfied ."}
{"text":"Updating review because it seems they have corrected some of the staff issues:) good to see that they listen! Oh and... They have WiFi;)"}
{"text":"I have been waiting half an hour for me food. This is the first time I have ever been in Rachel's kitchen to eat and it will 100% be my last time. I do understand that it gets busy at times but it's no excuse to wait this long for food. They brought my girlfriend her food first and I waited another few minutes to receive mine. These are just practical mistakes that they shouldn't make. 
Foods not bad though."}
{"text":"ALERT ALERT!!! juice bar in an airport!! Fresh juice made here!! These are rare gems in airports, and so hard to find. fresh veggies and fruit in a juicer and made to order! This morning I had a kale, spinach, apple, cucumber, ginger, celery, and carrot! This is a new main staple for me! Thank you rachels kitchen!!"}
{"text":"I just love this place! Food is always consistently good and the staff is always friendly and helpful. My go to spot for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"I love their smoothies. It is a little expensive, but if I am craving a good smoothie this is the place to go. Great food too, all healthy options."}
{"text":"I have only been here during breakfast hours but I do have to say the breakfast food is good. However, unlike other places, I don't have a go-to dish at Rachel's. 

Rather, I have a go-to drink: the WATERMELON JUICE. It's my favorite and I consistently order it everytime I go to Rachel's. I know, I know...it's just watermelon juice and I could make it in my kitchen with some watermelon and a blender. But on lazy Saturday mornings I would much rather pay $4 for the friendly staff at Rachel's to hand me a large plastic cup filled with fresh, delicious watermelon juice than go to the store, buy a watermelon, come home, and make it myself. Don't judge.

This past weekend was my first visit to their new Hualapai location. They used to be off Town Center but apparently moved a few blocks away to Hualapai. The venue is larger than what they had at Town Center and they also have an outdoor patio that you can eat at as well."}
{"text":"Stopped by after the gym to see what Rachel's offered for breakfast. take-out. I ordered a breakfast wrap and added turkey bacon.  Any place that offers turkey bacon, vegan and vegetarian options is awesome in my book!  The wrap was amazing!  The food is fresh and hot.  Even though the food was perfect, my favorite part was the super-friendly staff.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very attentive staff and the food was very good. I had the turkey burger with sweet potato fries.  Fried were cooked perfectly and the burger was juicy and delicious.  They have us some free cookies to try that were also delicious."}
{"text":"I wish we had one of these in Illinois.  I had an omelette for dinner and it was awesome. It was their anniversary, so they were giving out free cake pops and free champagne, which was a nice added benefit. 

They offer healthy options, which isn't always easy to come by.  Staff is very friendly and quick.  And they also had live music.  Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"Consistently good food with a dash of healthiness! 

I have frequented the Green Valley location which I've enjoyed.  This was the first time visiting the downtown location.  Whether you are at the Container Park or on Fremont, this is close to both!

We stopped in for lunch.  Luckily it wasn't too busy so the line moved quickly.  I ordered the smoked turkey and avocado sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Delicious! The sandwich was thick full of turkey. They certainly didn't skimp on fillings.  I probably should've stopped eating when I finished half but it was too good! The sweet potato fries were perfect.  

There was a bit of a smell near one of the tables by the door.  Some of the tables weren't cleaned very well.  I'm hoping they can keep up with that a little better.  

Otherwise Rachel's food is always good and wouldn't hesitate to stop back in!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious Chicken Caesar Wrap this evening. Although, it was hard to decide on what I wanted to eat because their menu was full of yummy options."}
{"text":"Honestly, I feel like it is overrated. There are many people who rant and rave about this restaurant, but I really don't see anything special about it. I've had a few of the salads before, but they're too overpriced. The environment inside is nice though if you're looking for somewhere to stop and catch a breath of fresh air or relax during a lunch break."}
{"text":"Amazing! I worked with Liz and Nancy to set up a buffet lunch at the restaurant for my daughter's soccer team. We had a total of 40 players and parents, and everyone was superbly happy. Not an easy accomplishment. The food was fresh and tasty and abundant.  Everything was ready when we arrived. We ordered from the catering menu and had a variety of sandwiches, pastas, salads, smoothies, and desserts. There was not a single miss in the bunch. My favorite was the signature pasta, and the kids loved the traditional pasta, and the wraps and sandwiches. Everyone loved the desserts. The staff was very friendly and super helpful. I have set up many team meals and this one was by far the best. If we were local, I would do every team meal there, and if we return to Vegas, we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is good food. I like good food. Also, it's quite quiet here giving me the opportunity to hear my own thoughts :)"}
{"text":"We came here because it was the closest brunch spot to our hotel during Life is Beautiful. We had to wait an excessively long time to get our food, but keep in mind that they were COMPLETELY slammed with festival attendees, so it may not always take them a long time. 

The interior/decor is very nice. The staff and manager were approachable, helpful, and friendly. The dining area is very clean and tidy. 

The food is decent if not a little pricey for its quality, but it met our needs very well."}
{"text":"Yummy Salad the sweetest staff. Thank you Vanessa for your patience. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Rachel's kitchen BRAVO!!!

I am so far beyond impressed with your food. 

I ordered \"The Favorite\" and added spinach:) and it is delicious. I appreciate that it comes with hash browns and toast. The jelly for the toast is so very good. The quality of all the ingredients in the scramble, especially the goat cheese, is great. 

Luckily for Rachel's kitchen I live quite close, so I'll be coming around more often. 

So yes, 5 out of 5 for us healthy folks. Definately eat here."}
{"text":"Food is decent but overpriced. Had their '404 (or some #) sandwich with grilled chicken.  The piece of chicken was extremely small - and overcooked - very dry.  Avocado was good and goat cheese was tasteful. My kid had a grilled cheese - really good.  Average service.
Panera beats this place any day."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by for lunch today. While we were ordering a woman behind asked a young lady behind the counter a question about a salad, when she responded she wasn't sure the lady behind us had a rude comment, the cashier waiting on us immediately defended his coworker very kindly by pointing out that she had just started working there today and he would be glad to answer her questions when he was done waiting on us. 
I ordered a burger I normally cut my burgers up because I am weird like that, I found my burger was under cooked. Before I could even get out of my seat someone was right by my side asking if my burger was ok. When I explained it was undercooked she took it right back and had one remade for me. I am beyond impressed with the service and the the food! The sweet potato fries were some of the best I have ever had and the burger was delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here now rotting away. Waiting and waiting for an omelette and a salad to go. I'm the only customer here too. Not even another take out order. Every time I come here it just gets slower and slower. 

They've messed up my order during my past 2 visits here. Let's hope they at least get this one right. 

I hope the original founder of Rachel's, who built an amazing business in Summerlin, reads this. Get over to this location and crack the whip. The staff is slow and spend too much time chatting with one another. 

Oh, and the last time my order was messed up, I sent it back, and caught a nasty glare from a chef in the kitchen. Real welcoming and comforting. 

I just got to my office with the order and had to add...No wonder the order took so long, they were burning omelet. Dry and gross. 

This is my last time coming to this location."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen and Kathy saved our monthly breakfast program! Now, I am referencing the catering that she does for our non-profit. We get amazing breakfast burritos, roasted potatoes, yogurt parfaits, fruit, OJ and coffee all for a little over 20% less than whom we had before.The catering previous was OK, but just a basic continental with scrambled eggs. 

They also do lunches for us sometimes and their chicken curry wrap is a huge hit along with the Asian salads. Another pleasing aspect is the people and service. Wonderful to work with and always fix any issues immediately. 

Of course this actual location is great as well along with the one in the Lou Ruvo center. I've been to both a couple times. Thanks for saving the day for us at least once a month! So refreshing to have better food for less along with crazy good service."}
{"text":"Not the healthiest but good enough.  Strange vibe, like a chain but trying to not be cookie cutter. Quality of food was good, preparation was as requested.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The service here is phenomenal. Each time I come in' I'm greeted with a smile and short wait times. Healthy, sanitary, and quality tasting food. This place is a must-go for those who are addicted to eating healthy and enjoy genuine service. Furthermore, the layout is very spacious giving customers plenty of area to sit and avoid being disturbed. I take my family here a few times a month and we are never disappointed. In my last visit, I received a free watermelon smoothie complimentary of the kitchen as a result of being a regular customer. Overall, the staff is friendly and caters to your needs while the food is absolutely delicious and will have you walking out satisfied. No complaints and a five star choice for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Which Rachel's shall i choose?  Henderson welcomes a 2nd location of a wonderful restaurant.   

Located off of Warm Springs, it's attached to the Hilton Garden Inn.  Strange?  Yes.  But as I was sitting inside I wished more hotels I stayed at had a Rachel's connected.  Lucky guests!  The dining area is much much larger than the other locations of Rachel's.  Many tables, booths and patio seating.  If you're staying at the hotel they will also bring your food to the pool area.  Nice!  Friendly service and very accommodating.

I ordered the turkey club.  The overly stuffed and stacked sandwich is delicious!   Triple layers of turkey, bacon, swiss, avocado, lettuce, tomato & mayo.   Yikes!  I really had to compress it to take a bite.  But it's worth the hard work keeping the fresh ingredients together.  It also helps when you have tasty sweet potato fries on the side.  A great meal all around.

For locals and visiting hotel guests, Rachel's definitely has a great kitchen!"}
{"text":"I agree with a lot of the reviews.  It is always hard for me to choose what to eat because a lot of the menu is underwhelming.  
The grilled cheese was almost inedible.  It was so greasy and the quality of the ingredients were poor. I have been to healthy restaurants were the food has a lot of flavor and tastes much fresher, but the food here is always pretty bland. I think the reason it is so popular because there isn't an alternative choice. 

I do like the Popeye's Secret juice.  Hard to mess up on juice though."}
{"text":"For brunch this place does the job. Anything from pancakes to sandwiches to pasta dishes. Although good, don't expect to be blown away it is truly a hipper glorified Denny's. Must do's here are the signature pasta and the ultimate grilled cheese. They have fresh choices and alternative healthier options. With that said I would recommend it for breakfast over Denny's IHOP and or blueberry hill"}
{"text":"Located inside the District at Green Valley Ranch.. Rachel's Kitchen has never disappointed me!

Small, up-to-date, cute restaurant. Friendly staff and good service!

They have breakfast and lunch items to choose from! Wraps, sandwiches, pastas, salads, etc. My favorite items have to be their pastas -- either Signature or Garden Pasta, substituted with their gluten-free quinoa pasta! Very tasty, healthy food!

Suggested for your reps to bring this in the office for lunch meetings and such!"}
{"text":"So thankful! I was hungry and needed some real food- healthy clean style. 

This place was perfect- the hummus sandwich and fruit bowl were fresh and in a sea of restaurants that did not offer vegan options- I was sooo happy to have this place! 

Thank you to the kind employees who also on the spot prepared the hummus sandwich for me when there wasn't any available on the shelf to \"pick up and go.\""}
{"text":"I like this place, The Atmosphere is good!I reccomend this restaurant to everyone!Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is simply okay. It's not great, but I'm not upset that I tried it. 

I considered giving it two stars, because they completely forgot to give me the smoothy I ordered. I had to go back and ask for it, and then still had to wait a while to get it. I was almost done eating my meal by the time I finally got the drink. I decided to settle on three stars, because the salad was pretty good and the restaurant was decorated nicely. 

The have a pretty wide selection which is nice, and the portions are fairly large. The pricing is a little high, especially considering there is no table service. The selections are all pretty standard, and I wouldn't say that there is anything special about Rachel's Kitchen. It's a very average restaurant with okay food."}
{"text":"I love Rachel's Kitchen but sometimes I just have enough time to grab and go.  Here is the perfect solution and still all of my favorite dishes.  Loving the Lou Ruvo Rachel's where I can get lunch quickly when I am working at the RJ."}
{"text":"If you're looking for healthy food, Rachel's Cafe is it. Their only downfall that I can find is prices. You can easily spend $15 for one meal and then some , which for me on fixed income is hugely difficult. The service, however; is good I like to eat healthy when I can but this would not be my first priority."}
{"text":"I love this little spot. The iced coffee with almond milk is my favorite! The food is consistent and pretty good too."}
{"text":"I am officially addicted to this place, it seems I just cannot stay away. I tried it for the first time a couple months ago and I've been coming back nearly every week. The food and ingredients are always fresh. they offer freshly made juices and or smoothies. I love, love, love it! 4 stars only because it is a bit pricey but still worth the cost in my opinion."}
{"text":"I met the Moll-tern here for lunch since both of us had this place bookmarked for a while. The high ratings are definitely well deserved as the food was delicious and fresh and the space plentiful and clean. Also, I am loving the patio seating until it gets scorching hot outside.

I parked in the plentiful lot behind Lucille's BBQ at The District, and it was only a short walk form there.

I ordered off their \"Lighter Side\" menu and opted for the grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad. Both the salad and the sandwich were delicious. The sandwich had grilled chicken breast, grilled eggplant, roasted red bell peppers, tomatoes, romaine lettuce and reduced fat mayo. Clocked in at about 330 calories with the salad. Not bad for a filling, quality lunch. Calories well spent.

My only gripe is that the calories are only displayed on the \"Lighter Side\" portion of the menu.

This is a great go-to spot for a healthy lunch."}
{"text":"I agree with Matt S. below. His review was spot on. They appeared to be a new in business restaurant, so they do have much to learn. For one thing we ordered pancakes with eggs easy over. They said they cannot make easy over they would only make over medium. I agreed, but when they came they were easy over. They will serve you fruit with your pancakes. But I'm just not used to having my watermelon & cantaloupe dipped in syrup before I eat them. The prices were about average and the food was also just about average. I really did not see anything that would set this restaurant a part from the pack. It is a casual setting it is not a restaurant setting where you are catered to. It is somewhere between fast food and a restaurant in their atmosphere. But on the positive side they are very friendly and they have outdoor seating. I would guess that by heeding the reviews posted they will be a 4 star kitchen in no time."}
{"text":"I'm vegan so I was looking up restaurants that my husband and I could both enjoy (he's not vegan). This one popped up so we tried it. My husband had a mushroom burger which he loved! I had an Acai Bowl with a side of fruit. So so good! I also got an \"Energizer\" juice which I wasn't really a fan of. We went right when they opened and the place was very clean. They staff was super friendly and helpful. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I added some bacon to the 440 and it set it over the top.  Not a fan of sweet potato fries but these were just right and they complimented the sandwich perfect. A must eat for sure."}
{"text":"had the vegetarian sandwich and it was awfully greasy and fell apart. but the grilled cheese was good.

I wish they had more vegan/veggie options, but overall pretty yummy."}
{"text":"This is another great local spot for lunch.  I love their fresh/healthy approach to their meals.  The portion size is large, but delicious.  Also great covered patio seating and cute interior decoration."}
{"text":"I stopped by about 3pm and had a great cobb salad sans dairy, but they accomodated me by giving me some extra avocado!  The salad was delicious, fresh and I will be back to try other items!  The menu is varied and will appeal to all in your party- health nuts to burger fiends!  Give them a try!  I think you will be happy with your choice!"}
{"text":"So I went to a late lunch at Rachel's Kitchen today based at the Ogden, and I absolutely loved Adrian and Liz! They have wonderful customer service and are so willing to help. The chefs in the kitchen always wave and say hi and the food is off the hook. I have the garden pasta which is pesto and mushrooms and sun-dried tomato and I love it so much. I would have given five stars however if they had had desserts available. And I mean desserts like pies and cakes, they only have muffins and cookies. I would have given a five-star if it had a better dessert selection. But you've got to try their soup it's amazing and definitely ask for Adrian or lizz!"}
{"text":"Great food and gluten free bread was bomb. Green juice was perfect. Will be back often I'm sure."}
{"text":"Their food is overpriced and average at best. The service is also consistently slow."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food wasn't worth 38 dollars!  Tried twice but won't be back again!"}
{"text":"I ate here a long time ago meeting a couple of friends for brunch.  My sandwich was dry and tasteless and barely edible and my potatoes were cold.  I was underwhelmed for the price and avoid going back.  I just didn't get it except for a lazy, convenient place to meet and eat outside.  Location is the only appeal about this place.  I am not sure why people consistently say they like this place.  I think I also ate here another time when they first opened."}
{"text":"This quaint little place always seems to be busy.  Now I know why!  You'll find it in the middle of the District area.  They have plenty of seating inside with outside patio seating.  

The menu is filled with healthy sandwiches, wraps and salads.  Possibly more but I focused in on the salads.  I ordered the Chopped Salad Lite with Grilled Chicken.  Absolutely delicious!  The huge bowl was filled with so much that I actually couldn't finish it.  Usually I don't have a problem with that.  

The staff is very friendly and helpful.  This little treasure is going on my list of places to visit again soon!  

~ A friend of mine ordered some Sweet Potato Fries.  OH MY!  Some people find it weird that I don't even like sweet potatoes but the fries are a completely different flavor and ever so delightful!"}
{"text":"Love salads, so I'm bias to say I love this place. Nice aura of the place! Fresh food all the time!"}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is a great place to go for lunch. Really small, but nice and quaint.  Great sandwiches, salads, and breakfasts. Pretty healthy too."}
{"text":"Gotta love their watermelon juice. The only place I can count on to have the fresh fruit juice on a cold winter day!   As I was waiting for my order to be made I noticed there is something different about the place. There's more space.. There's more tables ..and chairs...there's actually more seating! Luckily the employee confirmed and  answered my question.. yes they did remodel and finished expanding it last month!  For a minute there I thought I was going crazy. Looking good RK!"}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is always a favorite of ours for catering events. At our last event, we called 3 hours prior to pickup to double a very large order. Kathy and crew kindly accommodated our crazy last minute request! As always, the food was amazingly delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"Ordered a tuna salad, satdown, after 15 minutes was told that they no longer had tuna. I complained and said that they should let customers know when they're out of a specific item at the time of ordering not 15 minutes later. I asked my money back and left the establishment.  Very bad service."}
{"text":"Great salads and sandwiches. The tuna fish salad sandwich is the tastiest in town and the signature salad is yummy.  But I'm afraid the prices.... are well..... pricey!! Staff was friendly and upbeat! Nice place for lunch!"}
{"text":"After a disappointing experience I returned to Rachel's to get my husband a sandwich. In my latest review I stated that Rachel's had cut back on child portions as well as fries, and that the fries were under cooked. Here is a picture of the turkey club with a side of fries. ( honest we didn't eat any!)This is the amount of fries you get with a sandwich side. Of all the things to cut back on, really. Fries have to be the cheapest thing on the menu, and the fries were under cooked. This was after I brought this to the managers attention. Feeling very frustrated! 
(Previous post below)
Very disappointed in Rachel's Kitchen! This is always my go to meal for my friends and family. We patronize this restaurant frequently.  Unfortunately, today I bought 4 kids meals and to adult meals.  I was surprised to find they cut the kids meal portion and still charge the same amount. So there are now only two chicken fingers in the child portion and a very small order of fries. When I asked about why there were hardly any fries, the attendant told me that the owner instructed them to decrease portion sizes. So I ordered an extra side of fries to share with the kids. When I got home with my meals, they were under cooked and mostly didn't get eaten. I also ordered a Cobb salad and Garden burger with a salad. The lettuce looked like it hadn't been washed and had dark specks of dirt or ? on the leaves. It was very frustrating as we usually get good service and quality of food. Guess I will have to find a new place."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side but hey, you get what you pay for. Cute green patio style tables inside & out. Everything looked so clean & new here. So my peach berry smoothie was delicious. My daughter didn't want to give it back to me. The signature pasta was so good. Not at all what I had expected. It reminded me of the pasta I make at home (that's a compliment by the way ;D) I was a bit let down the the chicken caesar wrap. It was tasty but the chicken was dry. :( And maybe the fries could've been better too. Just plain ol' fries. This place did get points for their choice of music. I felt like I was listening to my own iPod playlist while I was here. It definitely made me perk up and like this place even more. I can see myself coming back to try the other smoothies & burgers here."}
{"text":"Always friendly & fast service.  The wheat grass shots are prepared fresh when you order.  The country potatoes are NOT slathered in oil!! Yay!! The smoothies are so filling and full of flavor.  A healthy alternative to the run of the mill cafe."}
{"text":"Came in for a quiet Sunday breakfast with the BF. Location dining room is clean and well-decorated with bright and cheerful colors, and the fresh fruit salads and parfaits on display in the refrigerated case are eye-catching and make a good healthy impulse purchase.

BF works nights and is a heavy eater in the AM, while I usually don't have an appetite at all until the afternoon. He opted for the grilled chicken sandwich from the Lighter Side section of the menu ($13) while I kept it simple with a peachberry smoothie- wish the calorie count for the smoothies was listed, too, as I found it odd they weren't listed in the Lighter Side section, but the fresh-squeezed juices were, with counts.

My smoothie came out first and was flavorful and mostly creamy, just a touch icy. Portion was good, and I liked that it came with the domed bubble lid, so that the portion was not cut short by snapping on the flat lids as they are often served elsewhere. Nothing more annoying than seeing a giant, fresh smoothie being poured from the blender, only to have a heap of it get tossed out because it doesn't fit in my cup!

BF's sandwich was next- plated with a side salad with balsamic dressing. Salad veggies were fresh and dressing tasted homemade. The sandwich though, we had mixed feelings about: it was topped with grilled veggies (eggplant and roasted peppers?), and the veggies themselves were delicious. The chicken was in two small, flat pieces and was fairly dry. While the flavor was fairly good, this simply was not a $13 value for a sandwich. What we received did not justify the price. Having seen the product, this is not something I would pay over about $8 for.

I love to support local businesses, and especially ones that offer healthy options, but it really frustrates me to see places jumping on green/healthy trend and jacking up prices an unreasonable degree when their product doesn't justify it."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get and always busy.
I usually just go for the Hawaiian bliss smoothie. 
I can't make a better omelette or sandwich at home though. 
The staff is always happy and friendly. 
It's a nice spot to get lunch and sit outside."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my very first time visiting Rachels kitchen and i did not expect much out of this place. But, the staff there was so nice and always asked me if i was doing alright and if I wanted anything else. I had the chinese chicken salad and it is now one of mt favorite salads ever. This will for sure not be my last time here. Jessica and Yami were very nice and patient when i had any questioms and i hope i get to see them again soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is wholesome and delicious!. You can get fresh squeezed juices, plump onion rings, delicious pastas, and a table outside to people watch in The District. And not to forget, Mimosa's and wine! The staff is full of knowledge and very friendly! Thank you Rachel's Kitchen!!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place if you're looking for somewhere with good service.... Everytime we go the service just gets more and more downhill. 
My boyfriend and I come here a lot because it's relatively healthy choices and close to our house. The food is great. The service however is not. 
The past few times we've gone they've always forgotten one ingredient in our meals which is very very odd. Today I asked for a side of potatoes and they didn't give me one and said I didn't order one when they clearly heard me. But that might be because the rude manager cut my boyfriend off in the middle of placing his order so I guess she just wasn't listening. I ordered a coffee as well and the coffee machine was empty so we asked them to refill it and the manager said it would take five minutes but really it took 30 minutes and badgering them three times to finally get some coffee. After this most recent trip and how annoyed I got we probably won't be back anytime soon there are plenty of places in Summerlin we could go instead."}
{"text":"Walking in The District and wanted a fast inexpensive lunch. Read the reviews for Rachel's and thought it worth a try. You walk up to the counter to place your order. Lots of breakfast-all-day choices. But I felt like a salad so I went with the chopped salad ($11). The out door seating area consists of about 10 small bistro tables with uncomfortable chairs. The salad was a fairly large bowl of finely chopped veggies with a predominance of broccoli plus a little rice thrown in. Fairly flavorless. Not bad, just not good. Definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. I usually order online for pick up and things are smooth and correct every time. You can pay in store or online and pick up is super swift. The cafe is always clean and comfortable for dining-in as well!"}
{"text":"Such fresh and flavorful foods! My husband I I stopped in for dinner and both loved every bite!!! The customer service is also stellar!!!"}
{"text":"Rachel's is down the street from our office, so we go there often. But lately the quality has been going down. I ordered a turkey avocado sandwich, but they forgot the avocado. It was even written on the box and still missed it. The last two times we ordered carry out, there was little more than a handful of fries in the box. I thought the first time was a fluke. But it was the same the second time for me. Everyone in the office also had barely enough fries to cover the bottom of the box. Next time we decide to order take out, I'll recommend other places."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and healthy food!  Fair prices too.  I haven't had one bad meal here!  Must try"}
{"text":"The food is alright but not good enough for me to pay their prices. Flavor is okay, service is great, nice environment but I find it's just too expensive... example: bacon eggs & pancakes. They don't have a combo with exactly that, so you have to buy 2 separate meals (bacon & eggs) + (pancakes) and I can't see myself spending almost $15 on a small breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow! I am the Administrative Assistant in my office, and am constantly looking for the next great place to use when catering staff meetings. I just ordered through Rachel's Kitchen Henderson location, and am absolutely impressed! For just over $210, I was able to get an assortment of sandwiches, wraps, 2 salads, fruit and dessert to feed 15 people. This included delivery and wonderful customer service. Everything was delivered promptly (5 minutes early) and perfectly organized and displayed. My team was pleased, my boss was happy with the budget, and everyone's stomachs are thankful!"}
{"text":"Love the macaroni and cheese. Got some wine to go with it and the glass was small and not filled very full. On other visits I've ordered the french toast (yum!) and the breakfast burrito (meh..) I like that they have a flavored coffee, and the flavor is different every time and refills are free. Staff is friendly and service is usually pretty fast unless they are super busy. Seating inside is limited, but if the weather is cooperative it is great to enjoy the meal outside. The prices are a bit high for what you get, and some of the food is rather mediocre."}
{"text":"Grand opening at their newest location in Warm Springs. It's inside The Hilton Inn right across the street from Starbucks and next to the back side of Sunset Station. 
Jen and Gabby (Gabz) were two of the most wonderful staff members that they have. These two are the reasons why our visit today got better. 
This was our first time visiting Rachel's Kitchen....ever. When we were reading the menus trying to decide what to order, one of their staff members, Abby looked irked and impatient with us. Of course I told her that it's our first time at Rachel's and instead of saying something to the likes of \"Welcome to our place. Is there anything I can help you with?\" . We only received silence & a blank look. No smile. No acknowledgements of appreciation, nothing. There was a lady behind me and I was even the one who acknowledged her by saying: \"We're still deciding, why don't you go ahead of us and give your order. \" I DID THAT AND NOT ABBY, THE ACTUAL STAFF. She did not have the presence of mind to apply good customer service. It's as if we had to accommodate her & not the other way around. This girl was standing at the counter for the majority of our time there and not once did I see her smile on her own accord. She stood there with this mad, irritated look on her face as if we're bothering her. I think she needs to be rotated to work at another area, preferably at the back & let the staff with more personality and enthusiasm work the counter. No amount of \"free\" coffee or food can make up for bad customer service resulting in bad experiences by patrons. 
The food was good enough, we've had better. The Pancake, Chocolate chip and Banana flavored was too rich. We did not even touch their syrup to enjoy it with the pancakes. It somehow did not taste right. The Breakfast burrito is to my liking but there's really nothing to warrant it as my all time Rachel's Kitchen favorite. The fresh juices w that we ordered were great! Very fresh and very healthy, indeed. I recommend those to everyone. 
Not on my top list of the most favorable places to eat at. But maybe your experience will be better than mine. Best of luck to all of you."}
{"text":"The employees are usually very friendly and always willing to help when you ask. The best thing they have going for them is the unlimited organic coffee and tea refills. The place is also never super busy so it's perfect to get work done."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good coffee and nice service. There are a lot of great options to choose from, it was difficult to make up my mind!"}
{"text":"Rachels Kitchen is a great restaurant at the District. I have come for breakfast and lunch and not had a bad meal. I have tried the Breakfast Burrito which has a great combination of eggs, avocado, and swiss cheese and the perfect portion size. For lunch i have tried the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger which could be my 2nd fav. burger next to In n Out.
All the ingredients seems to be fresh with tons of flavor and the service there is great!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this is my favorite place to eat lunch with my girlfriends! We come here at least once a week and it always has great service. My favorite thing to get on the menu is a 440 sandwich, but the food isn't the only good thing, they have a great staff as well! I'm always well taken care of when I come eat here, always very friendly with a smile on their faces. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a quick bite to eat! :)"}
{"text":"Love the delicious food at this place! My faves are the chicken ceaser wrap and the chicken salad!"}
{"text":"One of the best grilled veggie sandwiches in vegas. I've had it a couple of times and it always tastes fresh. Service is fast as well and if you check in they usually have some sort of Yelp special going on."}
{"text":"I come here a lot .. 3rd time this week ! It took me 27 mins to get my pancakes today ! I watched pep that came in way after me , eat and leave !! Very disappointed ! I had a teaspoon of syrup w pancakes and no butter .. I won't b bk ! Totally ruined it for me !

I wrote this in the heat if the moment .. I have to say I was contacted by their corporate office and they are trying to make the situation right . Great customer service"}
{"text":"Went to rachels kitchen and I ordered the 440 sandwich,the chicken was really good,and the fries were fresh and crispy just like I ordered. My 13yr old  brother got the tomato basil pasta,unusual of him because he gets chicken tenders/nuggets anywhere , and to be honest I though I was going to waist my money and order the tenders for him...but im amazed with  the cooks,my little brother actually ate all the pasta!!!
We are totally coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in during the Mint 400 to order some lunch for the boys. The female probably sat on the phone in front of me for a good five minutes... There's no one else for the register?? When she gets off the phone there's a sorry and no smile. When ordering I try to get some smoked turkey and she tells me they're out of turkey (on an incredibly busy day for the surrounding area)... That's like going to the Burger place and they're out of burgers. Ok, so what's my next best option?? Her reply is \"ummm.. Chicken?\" That was her chance to make some recommendations or sell me onto something else. Disappointing for sure, needless to say.. we ended up with burgers from someone else and much better service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been eating here for years. Love sitting outside on a nice day and enjoying a salad or a burger or a mimosa! Everything is so fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"it was okay, nothing i would go out of my way for. Food was good but not great."}
{"text":"Word on the street (or at least \"word from everyone that I have dragged into this place with me at lunchtime\") is that pretty much everything on the menu is awesome. Sadly, I cannot confirm the status of other menu items as I am utterly and hopelessly in love with the Chicken Caesar Wrap - tasty with fries OR onion rings, but be sure to pack some minty gum if you go with the latter side dish.

A little on the pricey side as far as lunches go (my usual order comes out to $10.76 with tax), but a girl can only eat Lean Cuisine so many days a week before turning into a frozen food entrée herself."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome and healthy, but doesn't taste healthy. It's actually really good :) Since I moved in this area, we've been coming here twice a week. Even ordered some food the other day to my house, using \"BiteSquad.\" Customer service is top notch. They really take care of you! You can also expect the food to be Fresh and Delicious, each time. Try the Chinese Chicken Salad and the BBQ Burger :) Another great thing is that they serve \"Peet's Coffee.\" My favorite! Bring friends and family. Such a nice location, in the middle of Summerlin. Come try it out!"}
{"text":"Second location of a Rachel's that I haven't been incredibly pleased.

Second location that has terrible customer service.

Upon arrival the cashier never smiles, well neither did the rest of the employees I had encountered. Not only that, but it took over 15 minutes for a turkey sandwich with a side salad.  Amongst other guests who got up wondering where their food was as well. 

After finally receiving food and its delicious as always (side salad could use some love) I watched an employee also lacking a smile with her sunglasses and headphones and stand behind the register and do who knows what. Not a good way to represent your company. 

I'm just tired of the poor service and long wait times. 

Might have to start looking for a new sandwich place.. I might miss that Hawaiian Bliss smoothie!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Healthy, Gluten Free options, diverse menu, friendly staff, yummy juices.

My absolute favorite is the Chicken Salad sandwich! It's so good that after I discovered it I rarely order anything else there at all.

Sometimes I crave it!"}
{"text":"I work downtown and our office frequently visits Rachel's Kitchen for lunch. The food is always so delicious! I have ordered it for delivery and dine-in and we have never been disappointed. The staff is extremely friendly and polite, and the service is always pretty quick.

I've tried most of the items on the menu and have enjoyed each one, especially the pear and arugula salad, garden pasta, and they have the most amazing roasted red pepper soup (not served everyday). They also have a fun music session once a week that is a lot of fun. I definitely recommend Rachel's Kitchen to anyone downtown looking for a healthy, wholesome meal!"}
{"text":"Lovely spot. Staff is attentive, fast, and friendly. Food is fresh and tasty. Glad to have stopped here on my way out of the town. The owner was there and made sure we were well taken care of. Great place for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Meh.  Food is just ok.  It is a nice variety but not worth the money.  $7.95 for a yogurt parfait??  $9 for grilled cheese?  Fried potatoes look like Ore-I-da frozen.  No flavor at all."}
{"text":"Have heard about this place for a long time..Fresh delcious and healthy.. normally enjoy a great steak and potatoes when I go out even for lunch..But it was hot and I felt bloated. :) acai. Bowl and shake delcious."}
{"text":"Now that's a heavy pour! Food is great and the service is wonderful! Matthew is really friendly."}
{"text":"I have had \"healthy\" food from the Bay Area and I might have to say that I may have a slightly distorted high-standard but a standard nonetheless. With regards to Rachel's Kitchen, I would say that their food is mediocre. It is pretty ordinary and slightly pricey for what you do get. The juice is watered down and not as full/rich as I am used to (or how it should be).

The one thing that I would go back for (and have) is the Incredible Hulk shake. I am slightly lactose-intolerant so I appreciate when some food is dairy free. This one comes with silken tofu, peanut butter, honey, and banana and tastes like a PB and banana sandwich - THE BEST. Other than that, Rachel's is just meh to me."}
{"text":"I went to the one in Summerlin. Food was great, I ordered the turkey club with sweet potato fries. It was good. It takes a little longer to get your food.. but I expected that. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Love the favorite breakfast omelette. Food is hit or miss here I've had a some good and bad things but recently the front cashier lady was really rude when I was trying to order I have worked in a restaurant so I know what it's like so I try to be patient and understanding. I come in and their was no line and the front cashier lady was talking to a worker and she saw me come in and I was waiting for a good 8-10mim for her to finish her convo and then the phone rang and she answered it so I thought \"okay she'll put them on hold while she gets my order\" Wrong of course, she continued to take the order and it took even more about 6 min so I was like okay this is a little ridiculous so then she hung up and I said can I order already??? And she looked at me blandly and said \"sure\" so I was already mad about how badly she handled the situation knowing I was annoyed and after I ordered their was messy tables that weren't cleaned and she continued to chit chat to her coworker so I decided to sit outside even though it was freezing and wait till they clean a table. So disappointing because I like coming here and never had a problem before."}
{"text":"Great place to eat in downtown Vegas. It's a close walk from the hotels in downtown. Lot's of variety for food choices. Justin was very helpful!"}
{"text":"I love Rachels Kitchen- but I do agree with quite a few reviewers that this might not be their best location (Hualapai4LIFE) in terms of consistency. Let's be honest though- a bad visit to Rachel's kitchen is still substantially better than just about anything else in a few mile radius. I have gotten good meals and bad here, but the good occurs more frequently. 

When some friends came in from out of town and wanted a close place for a good breakfast I told them Rachels. They went and saw the outside, thought it was a hippy place and drove away. This prompted a heated exchange in which I questioned their honor, family lineage, and level of impairment. After a civil discussion they agreed to try it the next day and low and behold they thought it was awesome. Point being get past your skepticism and give Rachel's a try.

I have had a lot of things on the menu (I used to use a delivery service to get it for lunch pretty frequently) - so here are the highlights as I see them

Mac and Cheese- this isn't the Kid Mac at Outback (which coincidentally is also awesome) - its a more sophisticated \"adult\" (not in that way- get your mind out of the gutter this is a family show) dish- i.e. it has onions and mushrooms in it. I have downed probably 25 or more of these in my lifetime.

Signature Pasta- this is pasta in a tomato sauce with chicken and a ton of vegetables in it- great for convincing yourself you are eating healthy when you may or may not be. 

Garden's Pasta- don't be fooled- despite having Garden in the name this is not a vegetarian dish, it has chicken in basically a carbonara esque pasta. 

440 sandwhich- chicken and tasty tasty goat cheese (which is pretty strong)- not for the feint of heart.

Grilled Cheese- pretty good, although I would suggest subtracting all vegetables as an \"ultimate\" grilled cheese should not need them/they aren't a cheese. i know this- I put the ill in grilled cheese

Protein Scramble(again, mind out of the gutter)- this is a pretty good breakfast- recommend a side of bacon... or five

Pancakes- Not my favorite but certainly passable/better than most breakfast places pancakes."}
{"text":"I will never go again. I called in my order so I could pick up and wouldn't have to wait. The lady never gave me a pickup time and it was my fault I didn't ask, but you expect they would. So I gave them 30 mins and headed down there. When I arrived the food was sitting on top of a shelf near the cash registers and it was cold. I had also ordered a drink, and when I went back in to return the food, the gentlemen only gave me the $ back for the food and not the drink. When I made it aware that he didn't give me full refund, he replied \"you didn't bring the drink back in\" I was utterly disgusted with this place and its workers. Never again. I will go to the one in Summerlin and drive an extra 15 miles."}
{"text":"Such a good place for nutritious AND delicious food. Seriously, the food is good. Really good! Breakfast lunch and dinner. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I came back to try the breakfast selection after not being impressed on my first visit. I came in on a Friday morning with my wife. she ordered an omelette that had sun dried tomato in it. it was horrible. the sun dried tomato strips were inedible. Very chewy and you could not bite through it. the home fries that come with the meal are frozen.
the two breakfast meals, one coffee and one small soda plus a $3.00 tip came to $30.00 dollars. it was very noisy inside. I felt like I was eating in a cafeteria more than a cafe. for that kind of money I will just go to a resteraunt that isn't self serve."}
{"text":"This Rachel's Kitchen is right near my office so i have now eaten there plenty of times. Overall the food is tasty, but the service is not very good. Three times now, the kitchen has forgotten about my order, and it has taken them over 20 minutes to get my food to me... this isn't a fancy restaurant, nor is it a wait service so it should not be taking 20 minutes to get your food. The staff is not very friendly either. They joke around and laugh with their coworkers in the back, but when they are assisting their customers they can't even manage a smile on their faces, or a welcoming hello."}
{"text":"Located in the Hilton, we needed to nosh before our Vegas show at night. Hubs and I got the turkey and avocado sandwich on whole wheat toast - yum, fresh tasty and a good sandwich. Son got a burger, he wasn't thrilled said it was not juicy and dry with no seasonings. This place is in the Hilton, you order at the cash register and they deliver your lunch to your table."}
{"text":"Right down the street from work, so lately we've been ordering from our new favorite place. their smoothies are a must. Just today i had the Curry chicken Wrap and omg soooo good. check out the picture i uploaded.  sweet potato fries are also good. .  OH YES & THEY DELIVER."}
{"text":"Okay okay, I swear I'm not slightly skewed based on the name alone. Rachel's Kitchen is a wonderful casual and healthy place to grab a bite. I've been here numerous times for lunch and have always been pleased. Service is friendly and fast. They have a cute indoor area, but I adore their cafe seating outside. 
Everything is always fresh and dishes are thoughtful but very casual. I've had most of their salads and they are great. I also tried their grilled cheese and it totally fulfills your cheesy fix. 
I'm looking forward to trying them out for dinner some time. I also want to try some of their fresh fruit and veggie juices, possibly encourage me to do a cleanse.... for a day."}
{"text":"Love their fresh heathy food choices. Their staff are always nice. I wish there were more Rachel's Kitchens in the valley."}
{"text":"Yum! Great alternative to fast food...the garden burger was really good and had lots of flavor. 

I also love that they have a kids menu with items that kids will actually eat."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for lunch on 4/23/16 and both had the mushroom burger with swiss cheese and substituted the turkey patty instead of the beef patty. I made mine a lettuce wrap, my wife had the whole wheat bun. They were soooo very good. So good, in fact, that we came back the next day and ordered the same exact thing. The lettuce wraps are well wrapped and I didn't want to pull it apart to put any condiments on it and therefore ate half of it before I noticed there was no swiss cheese and no mushrooms! It still had an excellent flavor (although not as good as the day before), so I didn't say anything. I saved the calories and made up for it with the sweet green smoothie. So good. One other thing to be sure to do is ask for a rewards card on your first visit as we didn't get offered one until our second visit. Strange since it was the same cashier! All and all, a very good place to eat with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Exactly what a cafe should serve fresh food that doesn't taste overly processed. I'm looking forward to summer when its hot and getting a smoothie from here those looked like they would be fab. 

The only thing was the counter person messed up both of our orders by a lot and thus food was brought  to the table that we didn't order and we had to reorder and wait longer for the food. In the end it all got sorted out.

Yes, I will be back."}
{"text":"I love the quality of the food and customer service is always great, very healthy food as well. I always either get the turkey burger or grilled cheese sandwich those are my favorites."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious! Super friendly staff and the dining area was clean."}
{"text":"Ultimate grilled cheese was great!  Would have been a 5star but had to ask for napkins!!!"}
{"text":"It was a nice surprise to get a free glass of wine for checking in on Yelp! Food was great but I got a sandwich for like $15 which I feel is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have never had a bad experience any of the times I've been here or the one in Green Valley. All their freshly squeezed juices are amazing, especially the watermelon, my favorite. One funny thing about this place is apparently there is a difference between a breakfast burrito and a breakfast wrap. For all you bacon lovers, get the wrap. The burrito doesn't have any kind of slaughters animal in it."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner with some friends & while we were there waiting for our food order there were 3 men across from us & one of them was very intoxicated & sick.  The workers knew that the man was sick but the other two ordered food & then put it in a bag for take out.  Then when we received our order the man who was sick threw up all over the floor & table where they were sitting.  We were within 10 feet from it.  If you want to see a restaurant clear out it did.  Then the manager decided to call security.  The men finally took their friend who was sick out of the restaurant & then the workers finally cleaned the place after 15 minutes.  Then it smelled like bleach.  It was a terrible dining experience.  We also spoke with the manager who was working & she stated she tried to call security earlier & they did not respond.  She offered no compensation for the terrible experience we had to endure."}
{"text":"Chicken salad sandwich had more apples than chicken-wasnt very appetizing. Service was ok, food mediocre at best."}
{"text":"After I wrote my original review, they contacted me about this issue, which I really appreciate. A lot of places don't go the extra mile to make up for bad experiences, or even respond when things like this happen. So when they reached out to me, it showed they value customer feedback. Their food is great, and it's nice to know they're working to make their service equally as good."}
{"text":"Great food, but who wants to go to a restaurant in Vegas, in the summer, that has broken air conditioning?! This is something that seriously needs to be fixed!! How can you enjoy your food when it is that hot?!"}
{"text":"A wide variety of food to choose from . I think that it is good quality food for a decent price especially since it's a chain of restaurants from Rachel Ray . Just yummy ."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed. I expected alot more based on all the hype.  All the fries that came to our table were cold and soggy. My chicken sandwich was cold as well, and the chicken was VERY bland!  Both the Sprite and the Ketchup were amazing though!  I hope they can get it together.  DTLV needs some decent places to eat. Good luck.  Service was acceptable."}
{"text":"So I have lived down the street from this place for 2.5 years and never stopped in.  Why?  No clue!

I will definitely heading back here soon!

Rachel's Kitchen is a little restaurant located next to The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and is constantly humming with business!

My friend and I stopped in there around 1:30pm on a Saturday and it was rainy.  So it was JAMMED PACKED inside, since no one could sit outside.  We placed our order at the counter, waited for a table to leave & be cleared and we sat down.  They bring the food out to you!

We both ordered the Grilled Vegetable & Chicken Salad: romaine lettuce, eggplant, zucchini, roasted red bell peppers, yellow squash, tomatoes and cucumbers tossed with balsamic basil vinaigrette dressing.

Very good!  The portions are large, so definitely ask for a to-go box.

I can't wait to go back to try the Chopped Salad, Chinese Chicken Salad and some of their smoothies!  yum!"}
{"text":"Food is OK at best.  It is not organic but priced as if it is organic.  Wanted to charge me $2 extra for a juice because I did not want carrots in it, Whole Paycheck (AKA WHOLE FOODS) does not even do this, it would have been $6.50 for a non organic juice drink, I told them to keep their juice and I will never order again from them.

{"text":"Two stars for service. Have been ordering online for months and every time we have a 20+ minute wait time when we get there.  Why offer a time for pick-up button when you are never on time?  Under staffed for months now. Need to improve on that. Otherwise food and smoothies are great if you are willing to wait."}
{"text":"Overall this was a pleasant experience. The Chinese chicken salad was delicious. The burger could have been cooked a little better, but that may have been an ordering error. The staff were very friendly and the atmosphere was very clean."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying my family generally likes this place - especially the peanut butter shakes. However, yesterday afternoon our party of three noticed three lazy workers at the counter - one a supervisor training another... Long story short, nobody acknowledged our party for minutes until I finally said \"are you closed?\" Customer service was obviously lacking.

I'll go ahead and give it three stars because our previous visits were pleasant."}
{"text":"I have yet to order something I did not like. However, I would not consider it exceptionally delicious.. Just good. I usually eat here a couple times a month and the staff have always been super friendly. My main issue is their inconsistency in portion sizes. I usually order the Mac n' cheese and about every other time I order it I receive what I would consider a \"side order\" type portion. I can eat it in like five bites and its mostly all cheese sauce with hardly any noodles. On the other hand, sometimes I order it and I have enough for two meals. If their food wasn't so pricey I wouldn't be writing a review about it.. But when your Mac n cheese is close to $11, I expect to be full and to receive an actual dinner/lunch size portion of food. I'm not sure I'll continue to eat here because it is so aggravating to get home and realize you've spent $11 for a tin full of cheese sauce."}
{"text":"Food: AMAZING and it makes up for the horrible service. 

Cons: the service is horrible. The girls are so incredibly b*tchy it's ridiculous. If you hate your job, get another one. 

Sad. This place could be amazing."}
{"text":"I would just like to say that their CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD IS KILLER!!! I have never had a better salad! You won't be sorry you ordered it! Full of flavor and deliciousness!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Adriana and her team are the greatest ! I've used  Adriana and rachels for catering for years ! They do an awesome job !  The food is always fresh , delivered on time and they are very accommodating to my needs ! Thank you Adriana ! Thank you Rachels!"}
{"text":"In 100 degree weather, sitting in the courtyard was very relaxing - the sun peaked through the shaded and artful canopy as I marveled at the amazing architecture.  

I had the Albacore Tuna Salad on toasted Sourdough with watermelon juice and he had the Smoked Turkey & Swiss on Talera with watermelon juice.  The talera bread reminded me of ciabatta bread; and I wanted to try their gluten-free bread; but, they were out.

Fresh ingredients, thoughtful architecture - check it out."}
{"text":"I eat here over and over again whether it's to go or dining in. The last time I was in my food was fantastic- love their wraps! Only complaint would be a loud noise while eating inside, sounded like a compressor that kept going on. My friend was not completely happy with her arugula/pear salad, she said there were a few leaves that were not all that green. Otherwise the green tea was refreshing, and the service was fast. Cannot get enough of the caesar wrap (and sweet potato fries)!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites!!!  I love this place.  Take my word for it...I have scoured the Vegas area for a grease-free, all natural, and healthier restaurant to eat at, and rachels kitchen is at the top of my list!!  This food needs no further explaining, for it speaks for itself."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it never disappoints.  They've got a full menu that'll satisfy just about anyone.  I like healthier fare, while my wife is more into more unhealthy things.   

The service is always good and the food is delivered table in a reasonable period of time.  Combine that with a really convenient location and you've got my business."}
{"text":"I'd like to rate Rachel's higher however they have no consistency on their foods. 

Our food was marginal at best and one time you show up and food is proportioned decently and the next time you show up burger has a few tiny pieces of lettuce, a couple very thin tomato slices and a very tiny amount of avocado.

Something is definitely off if you can't make a good Garden Burger.

Won't likely be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Meh. Just average. The Cobb salad was good but it had too much dressing and was $11. The grilled cheese sandwich looked good on someone else's plate but I didn't taste it. The smoothie was yummy and the price was good. Again, average food. Most of it was expensive."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a bite to eat while roaming around The District, Rachel's Kitchen is the perfect place to grab something good for you and tasty all around.

I opted for the Veggie Burger which consists of whole wheat bread, grilled veggie burger, and mixed greens.  It comes with a huge mixed green salad drizzled in a fat-free balsamic vinaigrette.  My friend chose the BBQ Chicken Wrap which has grilled chicken breast, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, onion rings, and BBQ sauce wrapped in a spinach tortilla with a side of french fries.  Both were tasty, light, and made for a perfect lunch as we basked in the sun in the outdoor seating.  It was a picturesque afternoon.  Big perk is that if you have a pet with you, Rachel's Kitchen is the perfect place to eat outdoors with your little one!

If you're ever in the area, give this place a try at least once!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place! I even had a chance to speaking with the owner- she was kind and attentive. If you are looking for a healthy/light meal, stop in and check this place out. It is tucked away from Fremont Street, but worth walking off the beaten path. It is tough to find healthy food in the Las Vegas area, so I greatly appreciate this little spot on the first floor of a business building. One downside was they were skimpy on the sweet potato fries!! (Only reason I am giving them 3 stars.)"}
{"text":"First time eating here, delicious fresh food and smoothies. I ordered the ultimate grill cheese  and added bacon so good. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent omelette and sweet green juice. I got my juice without apple and added cayenne instead. Sooooo good. And the service was prompt and friendly. We are staying at the Ogden and I'm super pleased a great breakfast spot was this close."}
{"text":"The best grilled cheese sandwich!  Try it for yourself.  Good sized tasty salads.  Wine and art nights are fun."}
{"text":"First time here, staff was very friendly! Love the reggae music in the background :) the breakfast burrito was delicious! Cute little cafe, will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Pros:
* Lots of healthy menu choices.
* Tasty and well presented.
* Small, but cozy establishment with outdoor seating.

Cons:
* Slightly too expensive.

I live close to Rachel's Kitchen and have heard and read good things on yelp. I stopped by for a Sunday afternoon lunch. My girlfriend and I were one of two groups there. The other group was a fit looking father and his son. Since we chose Rachel's Kitchen for a somewhat healthy option, our dining neighbors were a good first sign.

We ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad and a BBQ Chicken Wrap with side salad to split. The lunch cost 24 dollars which I found to be slightly too expensive. The food came quickly and was well presented. The salad came in a large bowl topped with a lot of wantons and heavily dressed; a bit too much for my tastes. The fresh mandarin and cucumbers were tasty and almost justified the 11 dollar price tag. The wrap too was very saucy but the chicken and lightly crisped onion rings tasted great within the fresh spinach wrap. 

The restaurant was small but comfortable and the warm earth toned greens and browns were engaging and felt relaxed.

In summary, the food didn't disappoint and I would return again and try something else. If the food was slightly less expensive, 10-20%, Rachel's Kitchen would earn a 4 star rating from me."}
{"text":"Good food, but slowest service on the planet. I've been here four times and every time I think it will be different, but it never is. It's not even that busy! So if you are in the mood to wait, it's perfect."}
{"text":"Got takeout twice while at LIB. Breakfast burrito was pretty good, but the favorite breakfast was better. The breakfast potatoes that come with both meals were surprisingly good. Love that they have some healthier options like egg whites and turkey bacon."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and welcoming, all of the staff especially Hannah were very helpful for my first visit!  Walked from the hospital for a change of scenery and was thrilled with the quality of food. It was fresh and delicious and the Yelp special with a free glass of wine with check in is awesome! 

Definitely coming back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I still love this place but I was definitely let down today when I ordered their Acai Bowl...it wasn't even close to what an actual acai bowl is.

It was a bunch of granola with raisins drizzled with some sort acai mix that tasted more like banana than anything else and topped with mushy banana slices and strawberries. :/

So disappointed! The granola mix with raisins was super sweet and the overpowering banana flavor didn't help out. I will stick with what I have had before like their pasta and cheeseburger and wont be ordering their Acai Bowl again."}
{"text":"The service is soooo slow. They are friendly there and apologized profusely and gave me free desserts but come on. It's been slow the two times that I have gone. The food is good but I don't think it is worth the slowness."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is great. The food is always good. The portion sizes are more than enough to fill you up and the salads are fresh as it gets. 
The only downside would be that their prices are a little high."}
{"text":"Loving the location of this restaurant. The outside seating is also pretty nice when its not BLAZING HOT! I like the idea that they have fairly healthy things and unhealthy options as well! Its nice to have a healthier option, especially when your out and about. Menu is decent. Wish they had more options tho. People were kind and food was good :) So first experience was good overall. Want to try this place out again and really get a great feel. Pretty excited to come back again probably next weekend."}
{"text":"Vegas downtown has definitely benefited from having a Rachel's Kitchen open up. I'm not a big downtown person, but, if I happen to be in the area then I'll definitely stop by for coffee or an omelet or smth. Gourmet coffee, eggs, croissants and OJ, all fresh, what else is there to make a dude happy in the morning..."}
{"text":"The meals are expensive the portions are large, and the wait... Is excruciating! The 20+ minute wait and counting is making me very hangry!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good but some of the staff is not very friendly/ seem like they don;t want to be at work. At Rachels, I don't expect workers to behave like they work at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Such a GREAT way to start off my day! I got a BBQ Chicken Wrap and an Acai Berry Smoothie. Loved both of them! The wrap had a great combination of sweet and tangy flavors as well as a great combination of textures. I loved the smoothie even more. I'm personally obsessed with acai and it was a great way to replenish by dehydrated body after a day full of cliff jumping and hiking! 

In all, the place was adorable with a great ambience. I went during their prime lunch hour and the place was filled with suburbanites as well as an array of attractive businessmen and lawyers. A bit pricy for what they serve though!"}
{"text":"First time here!  Fabulous food. Fresh, great taste and reasonable prices. Had the soup special, mushroom. Delicious and you can tell that's it home made. Had the pear salad. Wonderful. And the smoothies are terrific. My wife and I loved it. Food made with love.

Just saw they're also at the Las Vegas airport in gate D, terminal one. If you have time, go!"}
{"text":"Love this place! When you're in the mood for something healthy and delicious this the place. Pretty good menu with variety and their fresh juices are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Rachel's kitchen is my go to place for healthy and delicious meals, the food & juices are always fresh. I love how their staff greets us as soon as we walk in and their customer service couldn't be better. As soon as I got their preferred guest card I never once forget it their deals are just so convenient. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat. Highly recommended it"}
{"text":"Great food and service. My favorite is the Rachel's chicken salad sandwich."}
{"text":"Banana bread amazing, acai bowl fantastic!  It's one of the only healthy places to eat nearby work, so I'm At Rachel's at least twice a month. Breakfast burrito & veggie salad I would pass on, overall pretty consistent with good food, juice & full coffee bar."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service,  former military, got out of the service about a year ago and put on some weight. Decided that i needed to lose a few pounds. Hearts about Rachels kitchen through a buddy of mine, and decided to check it out.  They have healthy options and it allows me to have different items,  not the same boring meals i make at home,  been coming here about a month. They even do catering,  had a company meeting and brought in rachels.  They delivered on time and the food was fresh, will definitely use them again! Can't wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"The signature pasta was delicious! So creamy and warm. My son opted for the kids pasta with butter, it says penne but I asked for angel hair. They messed up the order and gave me meat sauce and in less than 10 minutes, they gave him the butter sauce pasta and said to keep the meat sauce pasta. They weren't mean about anything and they made sure the tables were kept clean.
The muffins and cupcakes are healthier than an average place, here you can taste it. (The cupcake and muffins weren't moist at all.) I would stick to the entrees. 
The prices are expected and I wouldn't knock then down for that."}
{"text":"Really good customer service! Employee washed hands before juicing and put a glove on which was very reassuring :) great juices!"}
{"text":"It was just alright. The cashier didn't pay attention to us even when we are in the middle of ordering our food. Then the food came. My whole grain banana chocolate chip pancake was pretty good but the rest of the food that my family ordered (wraps & omelette) has no seasonings. Also their smoothies are pretty bitter. Can't compared to Skinny Fats. Sorry."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. I really like their protein scramble with no cheese. The restaurant is clean. They need new seating. The chairs are not very comfortable."}
{"text":"I would have given this location less than a 1 star if I could on the acount of the manager or so he says \"owner \" manny s. I have been going to Rachels Kitchen for a year and a half since i started eating healthier. But on this day i wanted to try something new. The chicken curry salad and wrap. I specifically asked manny s. How many ounces of chicken are in the salad,  he said and i quote. \"It has 4 ounces of chicken. My diet require i eat a sufficient amount of protein daily. So i decided to try it on his word. When i got home to my dismay there was a total of 1 ounce between the salad and the wrap. I immediately called the store to voice my concern. Over the phone he said to come back in and he would make it right.  But to my dismay for the second time he changed his mind and said i was a greedy person. And that if i didnt like the food there to never come back again. EXCUSE ME!!!!! WOW! Great business skills on mannys part. I have always loved Rachels kitchens food. But what i do know for sure is you don't treat people especially a guest who is paying tour salary like crap or give them that kind of lip service and disrespect. If i were to do that at my job i would be fired on the spot. And if any of my employees ever treated anyone like he treated me today, he would be hitting the pavement looking for a new job. It seems to me he lacks the skills to be a manager, and much less honor as a man of his word. No I will not ever go into the Hualpai location ever again. Because my money is good and hard earned to be disrespected by such a class less person. Im going to Greens and Proteins at least there nicer there."}
{"text":"Easy to enjoy such clean fresh food. This restaurant would be a great addition to any city.  It is wonderful to have restaurant owners who are responding to our community wanting more organic and healthier choices."}
{"text":"Fantastic food in a very comfortable place. Love coming here when I am downtown. Had a mushroom double cheeseburger when I was there. So good!!"}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen known for their healthy eats, is a hit amongst the healthy hearted as it is with the foodie fanatic. Everything here is fresh. We have been to the trails Summerlin location as well and it is what it is, just as it is as it is, at this location off Hulapai and Desert Inn. Came in to order food to go at around 8am on Sunday Morning (Super Bowl Sunday mind you) and it was surprisingly not busy as a lot of people catch breakfast here on the weekends as well. Atmosphere is chill and laid back. Nothing too special or gimmickry but a few touches of tile accents that gives it a simple eye catching decor. The food makes up for it with presentation and fresh ingredients. Size portion is reasonable depending on what you order.  The Garden Pasta is a hit with us ... A pesto light creamy sauce with peas, chicken and fetuccin at an excellent size for the price.  As for price...the items are reasonable priced as well with a few higher, but expected when it comes to healthy eats. Come check it out...it's refreshingly healthy yet deliciously scrumptious. 

P.S. - don't forget to check in for free muffins! & sign up for free member card to build points for free food each purchase as well as free entree on holidays and birthdays!"}
{"text":"Although I have been to the District a bunch of times, i've never stopped into Rachel's before. I've been to the Summerlin location in the past but I've always wanted to get this one a shot as well. 

I finished at the gym on Eastern and I was looking for a nice healthy option for breakfast. I decided to search yelp for healthy breakfast options and Rachel's came up so good opportunity to try it. I had a protein shake with me so I did not need any protein so I just went with the French Toast. It comes with a little bit of fruit on the side. They use old French bread for their French toast and it is super tasty. It was on the dry side which was perfect for me because that indicated to me that there was not a bunch of oil added. 

The flavor was really good. It came with some syrup as well so I used that to dip into. 

Great location, nice little place, several healthy options.

Highly recommend you give it a shot. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've always had a hard time finding a lighter food option in this city.

Thank you Rachel's Kitchen for helping me out. 

Spinach salad. Tasty yummy goodness."}
{"text":"Love the Energizer juice and the Smoked Turkey and Avocado Sandwich - they are my go-tos. SO delicious! Friendly staff, and a clean location as well. Rachel's Kitchen is top notch."}
{"text":"the food here can be inconsistent at times.  I do really enjoy their grilled cheese sandwich it is the bomb."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second try for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised! 

I have always enjoyed the lunch options, but the last one I had breakfast here it was an awful experience for a high price. 

Still a high price as we paid $37 (with tip) for an omelet, a 2 egg breakfast, and French toast. Omelet and 2 egg breakfast were delicious! French toast was a little different. Not the best that I've had, and felt like I was eating French bread with maple syrup. Lack of fruit came with the French toast as well. Overall giving their restaurant 4 stars for the hit or miss with the food. Some of their items are excellent while others are mediocre. Great place for healthier options but also give the option for not-so-healthy options, which works great for my boyfriend & I. 

Will continue to come here for now breakfast and lunch and try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome service makes this food even better!  The food alone is enough to come for.  But the amazing service and positive attitude here takes it over the top.  Start your day right by coming here."}
{"text":"We came in at 8 pm***This location was very clean and the staff was extremely accomodating. The food factor deserved 1 star plus the 2 stars for the staff. The signature pasta seemed like it was made earlier then microwaved. I know this because I've done it with the leftovers from Rachel's Kitchen/Hualapai location. 
My daughter got the breakfast wrap without tomatoes. It was basically eggs rolled in a wheat tortilla without taste. But the potatoes were yummy. 
The peanut butter blast was ok. Not too much flavor and it was overpriced for my taste. 
I don't have that many positive things to say about this Rachel's Kitchen. :("}
{"text":"Ordered catering sandwiches for a retirement lunch through ezcater.com. The delivery was PERFECTLY on time, and my team wad delighted with the lunch. One of our lunch crew is vegetarian, another gluten free, and two are emphatic meat-eaters. The sandwich tray had something for everyone (even bacon!) and the gluten free bread was delicious; no one could tell it was gluten free! The salad tgat came with the tray, too, was outstanding. I could not recommend Rachel's Kitchen any higher for catering; the added delivery service made it even more amazing!"}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen has NEVER let my family nor I down. We've tried everything from burgers to pasta to wraps to smoothies and ALL I can say is delicious."}
{"text":"The Skinny: wholesome cafe eats but so-so sweet breakfast offerings (3), service: it's counter service so don't expect much, wouldn't recommend for large groups because tables are small and can hold 4 people only(3), value: it is overpriced for what it is (2).

This is a local gourmet cafe spot  filled with yoga topped Mamas with their young in tow. Tables are small and are best suited to 4 people maximum - however even with 4 people, your knees will be knocking each other. 

We came here twice: once because we just missed brunch and had to order off their lunch menu, second time just for brekkie.

We had the curry chicken salad sandwich and their turkey club. For breakfast, we tried their french toast and pancakes.

The turkey club ($11) and a nice amount of filling and was standard fare. But really, how can you screw up a sammy that has bacon in it? (if you do, it's a travesty!) Loved the thin slices of bread but would have prefered real turkey breast (not deli slices).  The salad was pretty ordinary with a generic supermarket balsamic vinaigrette on top.

The curry chicken ($10) sandwich was okay, not enough curry flavour. The sides of fries were a little on the soggy side and not satisfying.

We returned for breakfast. Ordered a plate of chocolate chip/banana pancakes and french toast. Both plates came with a side of fruit.

First of both portion sizes are very Jenny (aka Jenny Craig) for the price ($8 ish). If you're looking for a good tuck-in with sausage and eggs with a mile-high stack, this is not the place to get it. 

The french toast was okay - the center was rather dry because the batter wasn't given sufficient time to permeate the bread. So it didn't have that luxurious eggy, fluffy center.

Pancakes were overly moist and not crisp from the fruit and chocolate embedded in there. Flavours were nice but it was hard to overlook the texture.

Overall, this place rates a low 3 star review and I don't feel the urge to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen has been on my bookmark list for a while now and I finally visited it a couple of months ago (bad yelper....but better late than never).  My first thought upon entering the Trailwood/Summerlin location was \"huh....clean space, nice colour scheme, but the decor was kind of sparse.\"  Less is usually more, but I thought that the walls could have used a *bit* more decorative love and/or larger wall art.  

Service was friendly and the food, which is the most important thing, was very good.  I had the garden veggie burger and sweet potato fries and hubby had the Cobb salad.  We enjoyed our meals a lot and were happy with the freshness, quality of ingredients, and overall flavour.  Prices may seem a tad bit on the spendy side, but 1) Summerlin location = $$ and 2) quality ingredients cost a bit more than mediocre ingredients.

I plan on coming back here to sample the baked goods and brunch items.  I'm glad that this location is so close to home!"}
{"text":"after picking up my contact lenses from my eye doctor's office, i decided to grab a bite at rachel's on hualapai but when i got there, there wasn't a single parking space to be found.
i suppose attempting to go there at noon was not a smart move.
then i remembered christie o. mentioning to me before that a new rachel's had opened near the trails so off i went.

i had no problem finding a spot as the center that they're located in has plenty of parking.
i think this rachel's location is my favorite so far because the dining room is spacious and roomy.
it's the same ordering system as the other 2 locations...order at the counter, get your number, sit down and your food is brought to you.
i always order the same thing, garden pasta, so this time i decided to try something different.
i had the ultimate grilled cheese on sourdough with a mixed green salad.
the gruyere, cheddar and parmesan were perfectly melted between two slices of doughy, grilled sourdough with the roasted tomatoes giving it that smooth sweetness through the sharp, salty zing from the cheese.
they've taken a childhood favorite and given it a little grown up flair.
delicious!

i really wish there was a rachel's closer to home (ahem, northwest part of town please!)
there's a center just down the street from my house that would be perfect!
=D
but i hear that they're opening another location at the ogden downtown which will be a nice addition to that area.
i'm so happy to see a local favorite doing so well and i will continue to be a loyal patron."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but was very diasappointed.   The menu didn't seem to be as healthy as all the hype.  I decided on a turkey sandwhich and a drink.   When I went to fill my drink with iced tea they were out so I asked one of the girls if they could make more.  She said it woukd take 30 minutes to brew. I wasnt in a hurry so I said I would wait. As she was walking away she called me something under her breath.   I brushed that off and waited.  I went up again to ask about the tea which was supposedly still being made.  I could see my food was ready but didn't say anything so I could see how long it would take them. Ten minutes later I got my food.   I have had better sandwhiches at home.  The bread was not fresh and seemed like a dollar loaf you would pick up at the store.  I never got that iced tea so my cup stayed empty.  I tried to go back to the counter to complain but the line was long and I was already irritated.  I complained on the website but never heard back."}
{"text":"This Rachel's Kitchen is superb in every way! I work nearby and many of our staff members order from this location. The food is always fresh and delivery is always prompt. Aside from the wonderful food and service experience, I'd like to also mention this Rachel's Kitchen is also involved with the surrounding community. Kathy the owner has a big heart and extends her restaurant and cooking skills to the nearby elementary schools. She held essay contests which brought the student winners to her restaurant to learn about healthy eating and she exposed them to foods they may not have been used to seeing in their everyday lives. She is a role model for our kids. We are so grateful for her restaurant and her kind, giving heart and her passion for spreading health, wellness and delicious eating."}
{"text":"We definitely will not be going back. We just finished our meals here at home. We had ordered a brownie for dessert specifically for my son. The brownie was not fully cooked and doughy towards the center. The only somewhat cooked portions were the sides of the brownie. We didn't realize until our son was begging for a drink frantically. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a week and the food is always fresh, staff is always pleasant, and the atmosphere is relaxing. I recently brought my dog to Rachel's on a hot summer day and ate my lunch at their outside tables. Staff surprised me by bringing out a dog bowl with water and ice cubes for my chocolate lab. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a healthier and affordable alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"TL;DR:
+  Location, freshly prepared foods
0  Gluten free options but they're not on the menu
-   Fresh juices not really \"juices\", lack of consistency in products

I was keyed up for some breakfast, but the buffet options in DTLV were just leaving me dejected.  Fired up the Yelp machine, and boom! Rachel's Kitchen pops up.  I wanted something delicious and healthy, but also was looking for some fresh juicing, as I needed to get some potassium to remedy some serious beveraging from the night before.

Imagine my surprise when it was a very short walk down the street.  Walked in, I was maybe the only person there around 8am on a Thursday.

Opted for the fresh watermelon juice and the protein lover's scramble.  I didn't see a mention of gluten-free bread or other on the menu so I told the cashier to leave the bread off.  She mentioned that they do, in fact, have GF bread, so that was nice.  The food took a bit to prepare, assuming as it's all made fresh to order. 

The scramble and potatoes were very tasty and the two slices of bread were standard GF.  I was not impressed with the watermelon \"juice\" - as it ended up being more watermelon-mash, and after the juice was gone, I had about 1/4 cup full of pulp - similar to when you get to the bottom of a slurpee and you have some thick slurpee-ice at the bottom.  I have had cold-pressed watermelon juice or even just juiced watermelon and was expecting less solid matter in my cup.

Prices were average or a bit higher, and I did enjoy the quality of food and the location - I ended up visiting twice more before I left town.  

Second visit - felt it took a longer than normal time to churn out a grilled chicken salad, but it was pretty dang good so I'll let it go.

Third visit - got the same thing as visit #1, only this time I got one slice of bread, which I didn't notice until I got back to the hotel.

Suggestions:
-Put your GF offerings on the menu, or state \"GF toast available\" or something
-More juice, less junk
-Unlike the juices, Rachel's needs more consistency in product served."}
{"text":"I love the food at Rachel's kitchen. Every time I visit Vegas, I need to stop here at least once. Today we ordered the veggie burger, chopped salad, smoothie, and eggs. Everything tasted great, the service was terrific and the staff is really nice and considerate. 
No trip to Vegas is complete without a stop at Rachel's kitchen"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out myself since I've heard many mixed reviews about it. I ordered the Acai Bowl, & it's bomb! Kindly requested for extra granola and bananas, and they delivered. The bowl itself is fulfilling, and I cannot wait to return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"A gem in our community.  The BEST mac and cheese in Vegas!"}
{"text":"They refuse to make eggs over-easy siting some health department code. However, this is the only restaurant I've been to, on the face of the planet, that has been mandated to hard cook eggs. Really?!"}
{"text":"A delicious breakfast definitely better than a donut.

Healthy and filling, their french toast, breakfast burritos and fresh fruit gave the good kind of energy that lasted the whole day.

I recommend all of their items on their menu too. Great food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I had the Sweet Greens juice, and the pear arugula salad. The salad was a huge bowl. My daughter had the kids Mac N Cheese and it was probably the best we have ever had. We love healthy options and this place serves breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"I had a tasty turkey sandwich with fries from Rachel's Kitchen for lunch on a nice end of summer day.  We decided to eat outside at one of the tables since the inside was pretty busy.  The food was fresh and delicious.  Price point was about average ($9 for my meal, water to drink)."}
{"text":"i've always been a fan of rachel's kitchen.
it's one of those places that you can always count on for a quick, easy, simple meal when you just don't feel like cooking.
i've been waiting for them to open on our side of town and now that they have, we've been going there quite frequently.

a few of my faves are:

grilled veggie sandwich on french bread
rachel's mac & cheese
garden pasta
signature pasta
grilled cheese
any smoothie or fresh made juice

the service is fantastic too.
they've even been kind enough to make me a completely customized smoothie.
i definitely wouldn't ask them to do that if they were slammed though.

again, i'm a fan of rk and will continue to be.

welcome to the neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"i rarely make it down to the green valley area being that i live all the way up in the northwest part of town.
but when i do, i love taking a little stroll through the district.
it's especially nice during the holidays with the big ol christmas tree and christmas songs piping through the speakers.
on this particular trip, i was hungry so decided to stop in at rachel's to give them a try.
sure glad i did.

i ordered the penne with tomato and basil.
the hubby ordered a burger with onion rings.
we even got a free muffin for checking in on yelp.

everything we ordered was delicious.
prices are reasonable.
service is friendly.

you order from the counter and take a seat wherever you want.
it's a small take out style joint so the seating is limited.
if you're looking for a full service, sit down eatery, this is not the place.
but, if you're looking for a tasty, inexpensive, quick bite, rachel's is just right!"}
{"text":"First time yelper here and can I say that these people working here were amazing as well as the food. They gave me a generous portion of food (had to take some home) and the female waiter frequently checked up on me to see if everything was okay or if I needed something else. Might have to start coming here more frequently."}
{"text":"Ordered the breakfast burrito and french toast. Good portion sizes. Fresh fruit. Smoothies very chunky. Tasted good, they just need bigger straws. French toast was okay. Was just three smallish slices of a roll and not actually normal slices of bread. Burrito was okay. Tastes good with some hot sauce."}
{"text":"I love This Place, food, juice and personal are amazing, and know they have wine!!!!"}
{"text":"Im really upset. I just waisted my money and I'm highly disappointed. I wish I could get my money back. I had 2 bites of my so called crapy cheese hamburger, my husband had a crapy turkey sandwich and we shared a salad.  (In fact I'm in shock by looks and quality of the food all around- it's terrible). What a joke and Rachael you should be embarrassed. You need to put more into the quality and taste of your food or your going down.  There was nothing right about what I got on my plate. What kind of fries are those ?!?!?- skinny little pre frozen shoestring fries that tasted like filmy grease and had a stale texture.  ( get rid of that pre frozen crap- fries have been around for what seems like forever - how hArd is it- it's freakin French fries- it's an American must know how to for any cafe that serves sandwiches/burgers - HELLO!!!). I felt like a child forcing myself to eat this crap (my punishment was that I spent way too much money here and I was regretting every second of it- I really wanted to cry- I really wanted my money back!!). I don't care how great your service is (which it was and seems to be what might be keeping them alive). but I came here to eat and eat really great food. The food should be at the very least, good. The food there was is just plain unacceptable.  The place is only capable of making salads. If that and That's it! Everything else should just be removed off the menu. And I wouldn't even count on them to make a great salad or be consistent  about it either. As it was not that good. What a big let down -better off going to Subway, McDonald's or Denny's. I'm telling you- this place SUCKS!!!! Low quality, blah, blah, blah, flavorless, and boring food. Not sure why they offer a rewards card - how silly!?!?! Only people who go back there are the employees."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful! service is sloooooooow. Don't be in a hurry and you will be fine. I have eaten in the restaurant once, too afraid of massive wait to try it again, and had food delivered 3 times. It was a weekday morning 9am and not busy when I had my wait experience, btw.

Food 5 stars: Service 1 star."}
{"text":"I frequently rely on the catering services and I have to say that this place is incredible. They go above and beyond the \"call of service\", so I highly recommend calling to cater your next event. The delivery is always on time and set up for you. The food is amazing and you can even order individual boxes lunches. I highly recommend any of their salads and the pastas. The signature pasta dish is a definite must try! If you're looking for a high quality meal with service to match, give them a call!"}
{"text":"Place is good to bring your pup on the patio. Food is healthy and delicious - a win/win. Some items are a little pricey for what you get. I like the location, being near shopping. Would come back when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Such a cozy little cafe. From patries, to smoothies, to gourmet burgers.

Came here with the bf around lunch. I had the Gorgonzola burger with fries, and he had the bbq bacon burger with the onion rings. The fries were nothing special at all. In fact, it wasn't really fresh. But the burger, I had medium well, was made right laced with a little pink hue. The shredded romaine lettuce was so fresh, it was crispier than a potato chip. unfortunately, I don't like shredded, for the reason it spills everywhere. I tried his bacon burger, it was pretty good- wholesome. Looks like they pick only the best quality in bacon. And yes, bacon has its grade-a's.

The customer service is ok, they pay more attention to their regulars and nothing really special for the noobs. 

i'd come here again to try out the pasta.."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this amazing little restaurant and what a gem.  The owner happened to be in the store this morning and was quite charming as well. The menu items warmed our inner foodie. The omelette I ordered (\"The Favorite\")had sun dried tomato, basil, mushrooms, goat cheese and Avocado. It was to die for good. My sister in law said that the Kale Berry smoothie was perfect and my brother said the potatoes were crisp and fluffy and the bacon should be labeled steak bacon LOL Everyone at the table was so glad we found this place. Next time we visit Las Vegas we will make a point of stopping in. PS Even if you are full, buy a Pecan Bar for the road, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Good eats, but slightly overpriced. Nice wine/beer options. Summer patio option is a plus! I've had their wraps and salads. Healthy, fresh, easy."}
{"text":"Sad visit for a Celiac. I ordered the 2 eggs. Which comes with bacon, potatoes and toast. Obv I went w/o the toast but then I also couldn't get the potatoes bc they are made in the same place as the chicken fingers. So I asked for extra bacon and they gave me 1 extra slice... I payed for an entire meal and got maybe half. Also the lowest they go on eggs is over medium. Just not really impressed after being a long time fan and a frustrated new celiac. Time to step up the GF game, Rachel."}
{"text":"I have visited this Location several times and I'm always happy with them! I love the freshness of their  food. I had the breakfast wrap and my friend had the breakfast burrito both served with yummy potatoes and they were both wonderful! I tried the acai berry smoothy and wow it was great fresh made. And you can add protein into any of the smoothies how great is that!  If your lucky enough to go there on a day they have tomato basil soup get it! It's the best!"}
{"text":"I am often skeptical of places like this because they usually make things too complicated, over priced and \"healthy\" but no flavor. I actually really enjoyed my food. 
Less than $20 got the Cobb Salad and the Acai Berry Smoothie. I expected them to be mediocre, however the salad is giant! I could share it with someone else or even grab a tortilla and make it to a wrap. The smoothie is also delicious! It is a little expensive but it's good quality ingredients!"}
{"text":"4 stars for great service, environment & food.
-1 for price. A leeetle over priced. Other than the $3 mimosa lol"}
{"text":"Cross off another Rachel Kitchen off my bookmark. Think there only have two more locations that have not had the pleasure of recovery meal or just good healthy living!!!! I must admit on this visit terms of the food not my best experience. I ordered the breakfast wrap something that first time ordering off the menu. I just found the whole wrap very bland. It was huge in size with more then my share of egg (you have choice or regular or egg whites) whites. Outside of the protein fell short on flavor and maybe should have stuck with the things normally order. You never know plus never had bad experience at Rachel. I was hungry so it did the trick but one dish not recommend. So much other good stuff on the menu be fine.

One thing that does stand out about this location then the other Rachel's. The little patio area out front with cover, ceiling fans, decent space, and on right weather day nice spot chill with friends. Usually one that just sitting out front of restaurant looking at parking lot nothing worth mentioning. Here not only do you have the mountains close by BUT best part is in the same shopping center have barre yoga/fitness gym. Course mostly girls but guys do yoga also. Point  being great spot people watch and hell if need motivation comes fitness seeing all health fanatics coming and going over breakfast/lunch/dinner. Inside feel like this location one of the smaller ones. The interior decor is consistent with the other Rachel's. The service consistent with the others never had bad experience.  At this location notice you get free muffin with yelp check in. Another plus one on this location besides for me really close by my house. So am sure be checking in Rachel more often."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and was excited that a friend of mine gave in to my suggestion to eat lunch here!

The menu has health food selections and even an additional area called the \"lite side\" for even a little lighter.  I ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad wrap without dressing and sweet potato fries.  They were very accommodating with my side request of no dressing.  The cashier was very helpful and cheery.  I love happy staff! 
Seating is plentiful as well, both indoor and outdoor.  As it was windy we chose to stay inside.  

The place was clean, very friendly with clientele and staff.  I would happily go back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"I thought I would give it a try because I like supporting local places. Terrible choice. I ordered a cheeseburger and my girlfriend ordered a chicken curry wrap.  I asked for the burger to be cooked medium and I got my burger back and it was cooked well done. The first bite I took it was the saltiest tasting thing I've had in a while. The only decent thing on my plate was the sweet potato fries. My girlfriend asked for no cucumbers in her chicken wrap but the mix is already pre-made.  We were told the cucumbers were small diced pieces. She opened up her wrap and there were huge cucumber slices and very little chicken. She was only able to have not even half an ounce of chicken.  This is the last time I will be dining here. What a waste of 20 dollars."}
{"text":"The last three times I have been here, the wait to receive our order has gotten more and more ridiculous. Weekend, weekday, doesn't matter. I appreciate having healthy options in my neighborhood, and a nice place to meet with friends, but 20+ minutes for a veggie burger and fruit (my standard order) is causing me to lose patience with this location."}
{"text":"I love this place! I eat here at least once a week and I love how fresh the food is! I always get my food in a timely manner and it is always so good!"}
{"text":"Not sure what people dig about this place.  The food was bland and it took forever.  If you like goat cheese though, you may like this place.  They put goat cheese on a lot of items.  Maybe they are milking a goat in the back.

Pretty crowded though so they are probably doing something right for someone.  I like the fresh juice option and the fact that the menu has some lighter items with the nutrition listed.  Although I'm pretty sure some of the nutritional information was wrong.  On what planet does a mixed green salad fat-free balsamic have 100 calories but 3.5 g of fat and a grilled vegetable salad with the same dressing have 159 calories and only 0.5 g of fat.  So dieter beware."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The asian chicken salad was amazing!!! Huge portion."}
{"text":"Decent food huge portions. The chicken ceasar wrap is a favorite among my friends and I. They have a good nutritional menu that adds variety to the menu. A bit pricey as well!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this location another chance, mostly because I love their food, but the service is terrible. I called an order ahead and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. I arrived in 20 minutes and was told they were backed up and to wait an additional 5 minutes. Of course, 15 minutes later my order is still not ready. It would be nice if they told people who called ahead that the kitchen is \"backed up\" so I could go elsewhere if I'm in a rush. Looks like I won't be coming back again. It should never take 45 minutes to make a turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"Food: average (breakfast burrito)
Drink: below average (energizer smoothie ... I could only drink a few sips, but i bet someone who likes that health stuff would enjoy it)
Serv: average speed
Music: excellent
Price: average
Other: that smoothie was interesting"}
{"text":"Wow!! There's a lot to love here! I had the Energy juice. It was incredibly tasty!! Beets, carrots, ginger, lemon, etc. I felt good after. I also enjoyed the mushroom burger with a side salad. I really liked the lean, healthy burger and multigrain bun. I'll order it again. My wife had the turkey bacon avocado club. She loved it but it was too much for her to finish. She said she would have preferred it with two pieces of bread instead of three, so we'll ask if they can do that next time. We sat outside and enjoyed the nice weather. The staff was great, attentive and kind. Love this place and we'll be back."}
{"text":"I like their grilled cheese sandwiches and french toast, but it seems like they give way smaller portions when you take out rather than if you dine in. Their prices are also a little high, so I don't visit very often."}
{"text":"I work right around the corner from here and I must say this place is simply amazing. I usually get the spinach bbq chicken wrap with sweet potato fries. Great staff, clean area and good location."}
{"text":"The beginning of fall in Las Vegas really makes you want to eat outdoors.  Rachel's Kitchen in The District was a good pick for us while we were out and about.  We recently went vegan so choosing the right place to eat with a non-vegan in tow can be exhausting.  I asked one of the servers there on what options we can have and she showed me on the menu what we can have and what we can modify to suit our diet.  I ordered the Tomato & Basil Pasta, my partner had the Veggie Wrap, and mom had Pancakes with a side of bacon.  Can you tell who is the non-vegan here.  HAHA!  

Let me tell you, the pasta essentially can be divided into 3 or even 4 servings.  It was so good that I had to pace myself and had enough leftovers for 2 servings for lunch for me and the hubby the next day!  The Veggie Wrap was good also.  Obviously I couldn't partake on the pancakes & bacon, but from moms' reaction, they were both good.  The pancakes were nice and fluffy and the bacon was crispy.  

Rachel's Kitchens' customer service is awesome.  Not only do their servers know what they are selling, the constant walk through by them outside kept us hydrated and our plates cleaned once we were done eating.  

I highly recommend this place for good eats, good drinks, and if you love people watching, their patio is the best place for it!"}
{"text":"Went her for the first time today and got my mind blown. They custom made my favorite sandwich ever.... Blt add cheddar and over easy egg. It was hot, fresh, gooey, everything you could ask for. Not to mention the REAL sweet potato fries melted in my mouth. Not even a full restaurant but the guy working was super attentive, bringing us the sweetest wheat grass shots I have ever had. I would give 10 stars if I could. Simply wonderful food and service. I live across the street I'll see you guys every day now. Thank you."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the Distrist plaza.  It's very clean, green decor, with outside seating available.  You go up to the counter and order first.  The menu next to the register has all of the details compared to the the large one above.  They make fresh juice!   I ordered the Popeye it had a strong taste of beets but tasted good overall. I chose the grilled cheese with onion rings.  They bring your order to the table.  The grilled cheese had tomato in it. The asiago in it mmm!!! It was perfect... Buttery toast with just enough crunch to the outside.  Delicious mix of cheese. The onion rings are thick and crunchy.  SO GOOD!  Only thing, they only give you 3 of them. I could eat a basket!  I'm craving it again already!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at some of these negative reviews since I stay at the Hilton every other week on business, so I'm constantly eating at Rachel's Kitchen. I'm always happy with my food here, large portion sizes, healthy and clean options, and I actually look forward to my meals here. I highly recommend the chopped salad with grilled chicken, the steel cut oatmeal WITH the strawberries and bananas, and any of the burgers on a lettuce wrap. There's also a nice sitting area that is great for setting up your laptop and getting some work done while you eat and not feeling rushed out by a server. The only thing I would say to improve on is that the meals aren't always consistent. For instance, one time my grilled chicken on a salad will be chopped up and the next time it will be in strips. Personally I like the strips better, so I think consistency would improve a regular's experience overall. Same goes for the grilled vegetable salad, sometimes the veggies are all chopped up, other times in strips (again strips are best in my opinion). Overall though, a great casual restaurant with healthy food!"}
{"text":"This place is great. It's very clean. Clean bathroom. Which is a must! The staff is very nice, however they are a bit on the slower side. 

I've had a few of their dishes: breakfast burrito, turkey sandwich, and the vegetarian sandwich. They are all pretty tasty, but the veggie sandwich was by far the best! 

Not a fan of the coffee it always tastes burnt, but their juices and smoothies are really good! Overall this place is pretty good, I mean I keep going back ;-P 

I don't recommend it I f you are looking for something quick."}
{"text":"Their prices and quality of food is better than what else we could find at the airport. We had the fruit smoothie, a lemonade and a salad, all fine."}
{"text":"I have been to a few Rachel's kitchens before but the service her was much better. The 440 sandwich was very good and my kids loved the Mac n cheese. I'll be coming back to this Rachel's kitchen again"}
{"text":"I was excited too finally check out one of the many locations for Rachel Kitchens. Really not just once but twice in the same day. Woot! Woot! I made little pre running stop looking for healthy smoothies or juice too kick start the day. They have pretty big selection comes too juices, smoothies, and goes on and on. I really enjoy the Hawaiian Bliss. All the drinks you can add protein powder for extra dollar either soy or whey. I added some whey loved it. Not sure all the ingredients just tasted light, refreshing with all the fresh fruit, and protein powder extra boast start running day. 

After the run came back for lunch with friend and running partner. Once again talk about  nice selection from salads, pastas, sandwiches, and more. I was feeling some pasta and carbs after morning run. So went with the Signature Pasta. It was good. The thing that stood out the most for me is the fact hearty till the bottom of the bowl. Not so much the chicken although too be fair nice amount of chicken in the bowl. The diced eggplant, other vegetables, and really nice tomato cream sauce that just right amount of sauce too pasta. The pasta never was drowning in sauce. Yet once get too the bottom of the bowl each bite still coated with the sauce. The portion size is GREAT! You do pay little extra maybe because everything more health conscious in mind. Everything tasted fresh, and getting healthy always good thing in life. Looking for healthy place too eat Rachel Kitchen sure is great spot! If not for all the construction going on in The District would say great place too sit on the patio out front, people watch, great meal, and great company great conversations good times. Now that I had my Rachel Kitchen fix look forward too checking out more of the menu. Best thing about multiple  locations one much closer too my side of town. Yay! 

The service and workers are fabulous. They great job of explaining the menu since it was my first time. We sat outside for lunch. Never felt neglected the whole time someone coming out checking on us making sure everything was great. Inside one of the best things with the high ceilings easy too have conversations. I like the colors interior nice relaxing, cozy, and feels like doing it healthy way."}
{"text":"It's sucks to give a three star - but I'm giving it for the food I had today at this particular location.  I ordered the Acaí bowl and the French toast.  

The Acaí bowl was more like a granola bowl - there was very little Acaí on top.  I've had this at a few other places and usually the granola is sprinkled on top - not a load full on the bottom of the bowl.  It was delicious that the banana was blended in with the Acaí, but then made it more room temperature.  :/  maybe I'll request not to be blended in next time ?

As for the French toast - the second I glanced at the dish I was confused.  \"Was this a baguette sliced up and dipped in egg?\"  Then I gave it a try anyways to see how it'll taste ... Not impressed :( I guess I like it the original way - with just a slice of white bread.  

I guess next time till just stick to what I know is delicious - their sandwiches and wraps !!"}
{"text":"Came here to have lunch with a buddy of mine. I'm not sure about the rest of the food but the pasta that I had was really good. I had the garden pasta. My buddy had something breakfasty that I can't remember what it is but he did say it was alright but nothing particularly stood out to him. 

I would recommend at least trying this place. I would probably go back but it's probably not something I would go out of my way to go for."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen Downtown is Awesome! The staff is awesome and they have awesome customer service! My company recently brought some visitors down for lunch and they loved it! We love the atmosphere and everyone here is always friendly! I most recently had the chicken salad which was delicious! Their fresh fruit is always amazing as are the desserts! Highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas, I am so disappointed in their food--everything is usually horrible and processed. Rachel's is definitely a good alternative to healthy food and not some SISCO brand frozen stuff. The food is okay--obviously more healthy than other spots, but its a little bland. I primarily go for their juices which are phenomenal. Plus they open super early which is nice to grab my morning juice and jam."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today, our party of 5, and received good food and excellent service. We had the chicken Asian salad, a BBQ bacon burger, pasta for the kids and an acai bowl. A little of everything. I liked the diversity of the menu. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I had the best tuna wrap from Rachel's Kitchen! Damn it was so good!! The only thing I would change is if they had the smoothies out at the same time as the food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Rachel's Kitchen.  The food is always consistent and one of my go to places to eat once an week.  Great healthy choices such as sandwiches & salads, but they have yummy burgers and pasta too.  My personal favorite is the chicken salad sandwich or the turkey avocado sandwich.  Definitely come and check them out."}
{"text":"Service was first rate, lunch was just great and there  was a very healthy menu with lots of choices"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Rachel's. We ordered quickly and had time to chat with a friend before being served our food. Food was good, fresh and was exactly as hoped for. This is a smallish place, but tables and chairs are inviting. Juices, smoothies and coffees are great. Perfect breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Got a bbq chicken wrap and it was disgusting I couldn't even finish half. Wilted lettuce, nasty bland chicken. I will never come here again. Slow service. Cold, sparse fries. My husbands sandwich was nasty too, he got the turkey club. Too much mayo, found bits of plastic on it. Cookie was terrible, hard and dry. Overall really bad. This location is a mark on Rachel's name."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite for an affordable, healthy bite! Who says you can't have it all? And the service, the best in the industry, the staff here are excellent, definitely the most courteous of all the Rachel's in Las Vegas!! BY FAR!!

Thank you Rachel's on N Durango!! See you soon!

#YUM"}
{"text":"Never been to a Rachel's Kitchen until one was opened by me in centennial hills. I've been there twice and overall I would give it 3.5 stars. The food is really good, especially for healthy food. They're chicken salad was as amazing as a salad gets! The second time I got a sandwich with a side-salad which was also very good. I do,however, think the prices are a slightly bit higher than they should be. They're basically like a fast-casual diner... The in between of a fast food restaurant and a casual diner. If they were taking my order at the table, refilling my drinks, and checking up on me every so often I would understand these prices, but they're not. Also, service is very very slow. It took about 20 minutes to make my sandwich... luckily I was in no rush. I mean I probably would come back here, but it'd have to be when I have all the time in the world and if I'm looking to spend money fast."}
{"text":"Great place ,if you are short on time very fast friendly service- the menu turkey clubs ,pasta like chicken Alfredo -fresh juices and some amaizing smoothly - the atmosphere is very warm .
Their customer service is all ways a 5 stars ,is always good for a quick lunch or a nice dinner if you will !!!!
I really recommend this restaurant ,very friendly staff !!!"}

I don't' know where I've been that I did not know about the Henderson location (in the District) but I'm happy I've finally gotten with the program.

Meeting one of my BFF's for lunch and on this healthy eating thing I've been doing, Rachel's Kitchen was the perfect choice.

Lean white meat turkey burger on gluten free bread served up next to a fresh spring salad and a side of avocado.. YUM!  Making lunch your biggest meal of the day, you can't go wrong at Rachel's Kitchen. Fresh ingredients, healthy choices, and food allergy accommodations you're speaking my language. 

Oh, and let me touch on their adorable outdoor bistro style seating options (as the weather improves here it's just perfect), and their friendly and attentive staff.

Thank you Rachel's Kitchen for making my lunch break most memorable and lets not forget about DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Cobb Salad is amazing but heck, so is everything else on the menu. 

With the recent discovery of my laundry list of food allergies Rachel's Kitchen is a sanctuary for difficult people such as myself.

I've tried this location in the past as well as the Henderson RK and both are consistently delicious.  I will say the West side spot has a one-up on friendliness of service; get it together Henderson."}
{"text":"Super breakfasts withing walking distance of downtown. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and hot when delivered.  The seasonings were a bit dull tho."}
{"text":"Food Quality : Breakfast or lunch there are healthy options available for me to get some good grub In my system here. From juices to shakes to healthy hearty meals.

Service: the service here is good no complaints. 

Location & Parking : this places sucks to park but it's not too bad just a cluster to get in and out of sometimes so hold ya horses."}
{"text":"Love this place. Can't go wrong with it. Has something for everyone. Californian style food and I believe a chain although not under the Rachel name. 
Juices are great & it gets busy so go early or find your sweet spot. They have outside seating too."}
{"text":"I love both locations, depending if I'm at GVR/District or 7 Hills/Anthem. It's great to get a fresh juice and I would be fairly safe in saying it's best juice for the buck, this far. But I'm always looking. ;-)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas.  Epically since I try to eat as clean as possible as often as possible. The protein lovers scramble is amazing and the fresh squeezed juices can't be beat. Pretty decent coffee too."}
{"text":"Whenever we need to cater in for a meeting we always choose Rachel's kitchen. The food is absolutely delicious, affordable and the staff does a great job at delivering the food and setting it all up. Ordering from Rachel's is a no brainer! 

We ordered their breakfast catering and their lunch catering. Everything was had and loved by all!! You won't regret catering in Rachel's"}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Rachel's for quite some time and have frequented just about every location in the valley. When a coworker wanted Rachel's for her birthday lunch, I reached out to this location to see if they could accommodate a large party around lunch time (they're always busy since it's a popular spot in the area) - and they did! There was no hesitation and Manny & the staff were great to work with to get our orders ready in a timely fashion (& accurately). I really appreciated how friendly everyone was and that they didn't make us feel like they were going out of their way with our large group during their busiest time of day. They made a quick lunch a great one for our work group and we're sure to be back. Thank again Manny & team!"}
{"text":"Food was very average and the inside wasn't very welcoming or cozy. Very cafeteria-esque. The food was a little over priced. But if I was really hungry and I needed something convenient I would go here again..."}
{"text":"Place is really good for healthy. Prices are a little high, but the food never disappoints.

I came here the other day for breakfast and ended up also picking up food to go for lunch.

I ordered an egg white omelette with chicken, spinach, sun dried tomatoes. Paid extra for fruit on the side. The omelette was great!

I also ordered a grilled vegetable and chicken salad to go. All white meat for the chicken breast. The salad was huge and delicious. I love the roasted peppers laid out on top. 

Shakes, salads, signature pasta, and wraps are all really good here!

Location is across from the D hotel. Parking on the side of the building that you have to pay for.

Definitely a great little franchise  for healthy food here in Las Vegas. Especially when out an about or on the go."}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat! Nice seating environment inside and out. Free wifi! Excellent food that puts a smile on my face!! Manager is very friendly!"}
{"text":"If you looking for fresh food that taste good, look no further. Everything location is consistent. Great food, great staff, Rachel's is a must, check out my pic"}
{"text":"My go to place to eat! Their service is fast and clean!! Certain days they have live music. Their food is always good! The location is great since it's in the district. Overall, this place won't disappoint you from all aspects."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the chicken Alfredo. If you know you will be running short of time, call ahead or order online."}
{"text":"I bought the 440 today, which was good, but the bread was soggy and the portion of French fries was so small. The customer service was not the best, the cashier was very stern and not friendly. I'm giving three stars because this place can do much better, but I do still enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"This is a cool & casual, bistro style eatery. I'm happy we are here today. :)

We Ordered:
Watermelon juice
Wheat Grass
Cheeseburger 
Chocolate chip and banana pancakes

The food was great, the interior design was tasteful, the music was calm and soothing, the staff was friendly, efficient, and professional. 

This place is sweet. We're coming back!"}
{"text":"Disappointing meal..when your soup of the day is Lentil, one would expect at least some lentils in the soup, instead it is a puree that looks and tastes like tomato. I also got a half a grilled veggie sandwich that would have been okay if the veggies weren't so wet that the juices oozed into the bread and made a mushy mess. Although this is close to home I would not make this a choice of places to come...ever."}
{"text":"Sunday and we wanted to try a new place other than our usual Lucille's, Panera and Cheesecake Factory. I've alway been intrigued by the constant crowd at this small place.
Sunday brunch and the patio dining was full. The inside was half full. We wanted to dine alfresco and waiting a bit till our order arrived was worth it. We got a spot. Yay! The nice november weather was perfect.

The restaurant inside was clean bytheway. Decor was simple but nice and welcoming.
Staff we're all friendly. Great service actually.

I ordered a Tomato and Basil pasta which was good.
The chicken soup with carrots and asparagus was also good.
We also ordered a cheeseburger with sweet potato fries - it was so so but filling. And the chicken salad sandwich with onion rings was great!

I took advantage of the free wine offer when you check in on Yelp. I requested for a mimosa instead which our the cashier guy gladly worked out for me.

The ambiance, the food, the customer service is over-all 5 stars to me.

I want to come back and try their desserts and coffee... And maybe some smoothie too."}
{"text":"I wanted a smoothie while visiting Cleveland Clinic.  Always wanted to see what the hype at Rachel's was.  Loved it.  Hawaiian Bliss smoothie..humm!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Rachel's Kitchen...let's begin by saying the front staff was lovely.
Sadly...I have to stop there with the positive...ordered a simple eggs and bacon (cuz my Dad just wanted simple)-requested over easy-reply from staff-how about over medium-ok...guess they have challenges with over easy....though every place I know is sticking an egg I tip of everything they can think of.
Me-The favorite-which wasn't...on both...cook must have forgot the eggs were in the stove...the over easy turned medium was fried. The favorite was drier than the air outside.
The plates were far too small for the serving.
My dad touched one bite of the eggs and I bussed my own table returning the plate to show them the eggs weren't touched but the rest eaten...response...can we make you two more eggs-me...ahhh no thanks...same cook and we're pretty much done.
To their defense..they also offered a dessert-which we took them up on.
I'm sure they have great sandwiches...but breakfast...no....too many other great cafes in the area that do breakfast right and how you like your eggs.
Sadly...was not impressed and actually disappointed and nothing strikes me for a second chance."}
{"text":"One of my favorites go-to healthy hot spots. I love their Acai smoothie! Must visit this place. So good!"}
{"text":"I am the pickiest, gluten free eater in the entire world. This place is absolutely phenomenal!!! I highly recommend EVERYTHING!!!! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is a solid breakfast option, and great fit inside the Hilton Garden Inn. Periodically meet a friend here for breakfast and found that they do most breakfast items pretty well. 

In my opinion, they don't do anything great, with the exception of maybe oatmeal, as crazy as that sounds. I've had breakfast burritos, french toast, eggs & bacon, and a few other things from Rachel's and none of them blew my socks off, but none of them were bad. Everything was pretty status quo from a breakfast standpoint.

When the weather is nice I do enjoy the fact that they have patio seating. That's always a big plus in my opinion. 

Now the oatmeal is actually something I might go out of my way to get here. I think the pic I'm sharing does it justice. Fresh fruit, bananas and strawberries, with some brown sugar - oy vey does it hit the spot. Generous portion too, definitely enough to be considered a full breakfast.

If in the area, give it a try. Their menu is served all day long, so you can do breakfast for dinner or dinner for breakfast or lunch for dinner or...ya'know. All of it!"}
{"text":"After all the hype I heard about this place I was truly disappointed . I eat breakfast out 3-4 times a week and will not be going back.
The only thing I liked a little was a muffin supposedly made on premises  ( Costcos are better)
Eggs potatoes and bacon were tasteless and toast was nothing to write home about. For my money The Lakes Lounge and Black Bear Diner are far superior.
Only a few people in restaurant with 4 people in kitchen and 2 in front behind counter.
Order at counter and they bring it to your table. They give you a paper cup when you pay and you serve yourself coffee.
Truly a disappointment .
Maybe a vegan would enjoy it more but I'm not one"}
{"text":"Over priced. Good smoothies. Small portion sizes. But great location. Healthy options. Friendly quick service. Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Management and staff were very friendly.  Food was great as usual.  1cheesburger, 1 sauté mushroom burger, and one BBQ bacon burger.  Coffee fresh, beer nice & cold.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"Always fresh and flavorful. Great concept and service. Having breakfast and taking lunch for the stop in Tonopah."}
{"text":"I had half a turkey avocado sandwich and the chicken tortilla soup.  I'd rather have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich from home... The sandwich small but OK and I wouldn't feed the soup to my dog.  $9.50... What a rip off!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for months during the workweek for breakfast and they simply make me feel at home. Comfortable interior, relaxing setting, fast wifi, quiet surroundings, and great service. The food is simple and well made. Breakfast selection tastes great along with their sandwiches. Healthy choices are aplenty here for anyone who is active and watching the waistline. The real reason I come here often is the great service. The ladies are very nice and attentive and go the extra mile to make sure you're comfortable. Thanks for opening up early and always making my work day mornings a little better."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst places I've ever eaten. I ordered the 1/2 salad 1/2 sandwich combo. The fries arrived cold. The chicken on both the salad and the sandwich was less than 1/8 inch thick and was so dry and over cooked it was like shoe leather. It literally drew the moisture out of my mouth when trying to chew it. We paid $30 for a hamburger, 1/2 sandwich & 1/2 salad with ice water. After looking around at the other tables, it appeared most people had only ordered drinks or smoothies. I can now understand why. I would never recommend the food here."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love it here, but I just didn't....we had breakfast and it was bad :(
I asked for the omelette well done and what they did was burn the outside of the omelette and the inside was undercooked.  The potatoes were ok, but my daughter had an acai bowl and that was terrible too....For $34 for breakfast for 2 people...I was extremely disappointed"}
{"text":"It was our fault to assume that this was a sit down full service restaurant. Despite not being greeted and just blindly being stared at by cashier.. We have this place a try. I'm glad that it Melanie is the one that look our order. She was the most cheerful thing in this restaurant! I had the protein lovers scramble. It was very average, nothing new, I can cook this at home food. My husband got some breakfast sandwich and it came in what seemed like grocery store bought bread. I'm sure the outside seating is beautiful but the inside seating felt like I was in a hallway. Don't really wanna be back again."}
{"text":"What a great place to catch a meal.  Their food, smoothies, and coffee are healthy, wholesome, tasty, and very competitively priced!"}
{"text":"I love the location of this Rachel's! After my gym workouts I can come and get a nice smoothie with fresh ingredients. I usually have the Wilshire and add spinach. The staff is always courteous and welcoming. I have gone for lunch and had the bbq chicken wrap and took the waiters recommendation to try the sweet potato fries. It was flavorful and a great life fare. Another plus is the serene environment and free Wifi. A great place!"}
{"text":"Best oatmeal in town. You have to try everything on the menus.... Everything is so good, all home made quality food."}
{"text":"My first time at this location! And it was great! Amazing service and the staff was knowledgable about the menu. Me and my girlfriend Lindsey were there for breakfast we shared the French toast!! It was a very soft bread with crunchy edges that was really good! I will be back soon!! If you are in the area check this place out!! Also I hear the lunch menu items are great too!! My friend lives close to hear and comes all the time for lunch."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast from here! My fiancé brought it home after the gym. I had eggs and turkey bacon. The turkey bacon was bomb.com!! He had an omelette with fresh avocado! The best was the French toast!! Must try it!! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"I had a pretty generic breakfast wrap (burrito) and a super delicious glass of fresh orange and carrot juice. My fiancee got a fresh watermelon juice, which was so well chilled and perfectly sweet that he has made me return several times since just to quell his cravings!"}
{"text":"Got a Cobb Salad to go. I had ordered online, and it (along with the other five meals in my order) was ready to go. It was well packaged and nicely presented, with a generous portion of ranch (which I do not recommend, nor did I, use all of). Other people got some of their sandwiches and enjoyed them. Overall, a great place to pick up food to go, and would probably be great to sit down in as well."}
{"text":"Food tasted ok.  Ingredients were fresh.  Ordered a medium cooked mushroom burger that came well-done and pretty dry.  The dining room is also rather boring."}
{"text":"best breatfast i have ever had. Only issue is parking as it is in downtown. I parked my car in takeout parking space and I was fined 20 bucks for over limit.
Careful when you park your car."}
{"text":"What a fantastic option for healthy satisfying food!  My whole family has been in Vegas for the last couple of weeks and Rachel's is far and away the first choice for our picky family. 

We accidentally ordered from breakfast for pickup at the Rachel's in Summerlin but ended up here instead.  The server was not fazed and called the Summerlin branch to cancel our order over there and had our food ready within minutes.  The food itself is very good and you really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great, quick, healthy cafe for breakfast or lunch. When you just want something healthy, this is the place to go, especially when you've been away from home for a week.  I went twice within a 2 day span, once for lunch and another time for breakfast.

For breakfast, I got Scrambled Eggs with Tomato and Basil. It was exactly what I needed.  Came with toast and some potatoes, but perfect breakfast to get my day started without being too heavy.

For lunch, I ordered the Signature Salad with chicken. At first it looked huge, but it was the right size to satisfy my appetite.

Everything on their menu actually looked really good, so I don't think you can go wrong with any of your choices.  Beats ordering from the hotel cafe or a local coffee shop! They even make fresh squeeze juices and smoothies."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for a sandwich. I am just not into the hype of this place. Sure its trendy but come on people. Food was ok. I just feel like it could be done anywhere"}
{"text":"I work nearby.  Finding great food at a great price and easy to get in-and-out are often not an option.  This new location is perfect!  The choices are still plenty and the service is exceptional, as always with RK.  I will definitely be back and have already spread the word to my coworkers!  :)"}
{"text":"I did not like the macaroni and cheese, it tasted like french onion soup. Coincidently that is the consistency as well. 

I still really like Rachel's Kitchen for their well-crafted salads."}
{"text":"Yummy quick healthy fresh and fair price. Short walk from freemont street. Everything you want in a tasty clean and pleasant modern restaurant. Staffed very well with a good variety of meals and treats including smoothies. Take a tiny walk from your downtown hotel and show them good food fast can be affordable downtown. You do not have to make yourself sick on a \"cheap\" buffet."}
{"text":"It has been 6 hours since I've eaten at Rachel's Kitchen and I've been feeling nauseous for the past two hours. I almost feel a little fever coming because I eat some messed up food from this place. The chicken in the wraps are not freshly cooked but precooked and served cold in the wrap. Mine was grilled and my date's chicken was breaded. WHAT??? Why isn't both of our wraps made with grilled chicken? Anyways, The meat was dry and probably over a day old and they probably didn't keep the food in a cold fridge to hold off bacteria because I'm starting to have symptoms of food poisoning.

1. Make food fresh and to order.
2. Don't think your customers are stupid enough not to know the difference between freshly prepared food and precooked.
3. LEARN TO HANDLE TO FOODS IN THE KITCHEN SO PEOPLE DONT GET SICK."}
{"text":"Working in Downtown Las Vegas, this is one of my favorite lunch spots! The parking is convenient, the decor and atmosphere are relaxing, and the food is HEALTHY and delicious. Whether I am ordering take out, or dining in, I always enjoy my experience here. I've also been on nights when they have live music for dinner and it has that feel of a cafe in downtown Seattle or Portland. I LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere,and healthy menu options make this place a great choice any time of the day."}
{"text":"I had the garden veggie burger which was very good. It comes with avocado which made it that much better. It doesn't come with mayo or ketchup so I had to get them on the side, other than that, I will come here again when I'm craving a good veggie burger."}
{"text":"Good smoothies and fresh juices. They have a very good grilled cheese sandwich and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"First time here. There are lots of signs all over the restaurant telling me that this is one of the best locally-owned restaurants in Summerlin, but I'm not that impressed. The food tastes really fresh. I got \"The Favorite\" a three egg breakfast meal with avocado, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms and basil. All of the veggies taste very fresh, but there is no hint of seasoning. The food tastes fresh and bland. Seasoning is important to me and this place just isn't doing it. It also came with American fries on the side and they are also not seasoned. They're lightly fried, but that translates to kind-of-soggy. The potatoes need to be crispier. The food certainly wasn't bad, but it's not the best food I've had in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Really love the convenience of  Rachel's kitchen at the Lou Ruvo center for brain health! 
Its centrally located and where else in Vegas can you dine  in a unique courtyard designed by the Famous Architect Frank Gehry?! The over head steel canopy  provides shade and aesthetic interest while enjoying your favorite menu item... The watermelon juice is one of my favorite items to order along with the veggie sandwich. This location is super convenient just before I hit the outlet mall or the World Market Center!"}
{"text":"Love love love me some Sweet Greens juice. I work at Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health and this place makes my brain happy. Service staff are exceptional."}
{"text":"Less than average everything...

The banana chocolate chip pancakes were so dense and there was really nothing special about the syrup that came with it. For the less than average taste and presentation, the price doesn't match. 

The peanut butter shake/smoothie was more so ice than anything. Lacked a lot of flavor and just wasn't anything of a wow factor. Add more peanut butter or milk or just redo the entire recipe. 

Thankfully the muffin was complimentary from checking in because that wasn't worth paying for either. C'mon at least do something right. They said it was baked fresh and coming straight from the oven. As I received the muffin it was room temperature. 

The only thing consistent here from my last visit is the staffs friendliness. 

My friends and I also noticed one of the employees walk out, then walk back in with 3 iced coffees and pastries from Starbucks in the same plaza. What does that say about the food and coffee here? 

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place and would gladly drive down to the Las Vegas Blvd for better quality tasting breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I liked the smoothie and sandwich. Got the Popeye and my girl got turkey and avacado she loved it. Yesinia was awesome, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great little local spot to eat. Love this place. It's right around the corner from my house."}
{"text":"I went here on Father's Day and the food was terrible. The eggs were so dry, they crumbled and fell apart when I tried to pick them up with my fork. The potatoes were cold and soggy too. The only reason I have them two stars is because I went there a few months ago and the grilled cheese was decent."}
{"text":"As a Practice Manager for a local medspa, we occasionally host events that need catering.  Yesterday was one such situation.  Manny, the owner was incredibly helpful with suggesting a menu for us.  And the food...wow...fresh beyond belief, incredibly tasty and healthy.  Everything from the wraps to the salads to the desserts were well received by all of our guests!  Rachels Kitchen was also great about providing all the utensils needed; not only eating utensils but serving utensils as well  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  I will definitely use them again.  And again."}
{"text":"I've never visited a Rachel's Kitchen before and stopped in to grab lunch while running errands. The dining room was rather empty so the employees were attentive and very friendly. I ordered the turkey club and they allowed me to sub grilled chicken for the turkey and i'm so glad they did. The sandwich was fantastic, warm, great crunch of the veggies and the mayo flavor (not sure if they add anything to it) with the avocado was perfect."}
{"text":"Since I (or friends/family members I have begged) have been here every day this week...and have pretty much survived Monkey Pox or whatever I have going on virtually on the following:

Acai Bowl: love, wish it had coconut. But I love it
Immune Support Juice
Popeye's Secret Juice (my go to: I have it almost daily anyway)
Sweet Greens Juice (zippy!)
Carrot Juice (orange!)
Wheatgrass 1 or 2oz shooters = grassy 
Tomato Basil Soup = CRAZY good
Cream of Broccoli Soup = not too creamy (in a great way)  and with some texture and carrots, I think
Red Pepper Soup (I think GF brought it over, today. Soothing)
Veggie Burger, held together well, no upcharge for a delicious, colorful side salad and great balsamic. 

Literally this is all I have had since Mon when the Ebola came over me at the gym and my trainer sent me home. Made a quick stop to see the ever sweet and lovely Brenda and once: called in and one of the guys brought my bag to the car so I didn't have to rock the furry Hello Kitty PJs (just call from curb) You can order online, too.  

So, clearly Rachel's deserves a bump up to 5*s for sustaining my life in a tasty and healthy way till I'm over Bird Flu. Glad some of my Yelp buds are checking them out, too because it really is supercalifragilistic. 

I, or one of my representatives will see you tomorrow. ANNND probably Monday. Open till 8 with a huge menu from breakfast all day to kids stuff, pasta, smoothies,  Vegan, gluten free = what I said in my first review before NyQuil shooters tonight. 

Told you I'd be a regular :)) Love, Christie O

{"text":"First time here . Great atmosphere.  Great place for a catch up with friends.  Food delicious.. will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Came here to hang out after getting an manicure at Miki Nail Bar (which is AMAZING by the way)

Blended vanilla latte with almond milk and half syrup - Awesome, the espresso is bold, but not burnt. No big chunks of ice, blended well. Not watery.
Blueberry muffin - Got it for free with check in. It's not your traditional muffin. It's a little on the drier side but it's not crumbly. It reminds me of like pound cake almost, which the drier outside. Still very tasty. Not sure if I'd pay for it, but awesome for free.

Excited to see places like this in Vegas! Coming from Cali, these are all over the place. Will definitely be coming back to try out more food."}
{"text":"My wife noticed this place on the way to our gate, and I went back I bought her the Immune booster. This is perfect for when you are ailing from a trip to Vegas. I'm not a fan of the green juice myself, but she gave it the thumbs up.

I could not help but notice that this place was nearly deserted while the Burger King next door had about 20 customers queued up."}
{"text":"Always friendly staff, clean and consistent food. My found my favorite so I come here for the same sandwich each time. Smoked turkey avocado. Excellent choice for something other than fast food. A little more expensive but worth it or the quality."}
{"text":"This place is on the top of my list in terms of breakfast spots. Delicious food, extremely well trained and friendly staff, and the owner herself isn't afraid to roll up her sleeves and serve you with a smile. The food is well priced and they have amazingly tasty combinations. My wife is in love with \"the favorite\" off the menu. I'm a standard eggs and bacon guy. Food comes in a timely manner. Their seating is comfortable. Their patio is dog friendly. They will serve your dog eggs in a plastic container and bring a dog bowl full of water. Again this place gets my two thumbs up. Couldn't be happier with this location!"}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is one of my favorite places in town for lunch or dinner. I love their sandwiches, wraps, and the signature pasta. I also like that I can get a glass of wine or a beer with my food!"}
{"text":"It usually takes a very long time to get your order. Even if you call it in 45 minutes in advance. So don't go here if you are on a time crunch or lunch break for work.  The staff is great and very polite, they are work their butts off, but there are just not enough of them. Hire more staff, please."}
{"text":"First I need to say that I have worked in many restaurants in this town since I was 15.  I am now 38 and a classically trained french chef.  So I walk in it looks nice, the tables need to be wiped down but it's lunch time and they look busy.  I walk up look at the menu and see that everything is $9 to $11.  Ok there must be something special about the sandwiches, wraps or salads that they charge that much for.  I order the Turkey Club, I am thinking \"ok for $11 maybe it is a Turkey Cutlet with some different type of mayo like an aioli  or cranberry or something.\"  Then my wife orders the Gorganzola burger and they ask how she wants it cooked she says medium.  So I say to myself \"wow, cool they are cooking to order instead of just shoe leather.\"   Then I order the Kids Pasta with Meat Sauce for my  3 y/o.  They asked me what side I wanted on my sandwich so I look up and they offer French Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, salad or Onion Rings.  I think \"wow I haven't had onion rings in a while I am excited I will get the onion rings.\"  My wife gets the French Fries.  We order three drinks and we are on our way.  Well we sit down inside and I realize they gave us only two cups.  So I go and ask for the third one that we paid for.  The lady who took our order hands it to me.  Then this Mexican guy says you already have three cups on your table.  I said no we don't we only have two and I ask him if he is calling me a liar?  He says no that I have made a mistake and that I have three on the table.  So now I am furious and tell him to come over to the table.  I count the cup for him and he says what about the water cup.  I said it is what they gave us for the lemons we asked for, for the tea.  I said we paid for 3 cups and I want three cups not two with a water cup.  And then he says sorry and goes back to the kitchen.  I am thinking wow are you kidding me that this guy is ready to throw down over a cup.  Then when it was his mistake he only appologises as he is walking back to the kitchen.  Then our meals come out. I look over my sandwich and there is nothing special about it at all.  It is lunch meat with lettuce, tomato and bacon on white bread.  They didn't even cut it they way a Club is supposed to be cut.  Then I notice my onion rings that I was excited about and there were only three onion rings. THREE!!!!!!!!.  Two of them weren't even that big.  So I ask the lady why I only got three onion rings and she says well that is our lunch portion and I reply well it certainly wasn't the lunch price.  Then she asks me if I want more and tell her no I don't want anything from this place.  Then of course my wife's burger is shoe leather and the best thing I can say about my kids pasta is that it had not taste to it.  They didn't cook the pasta in salted water and the meat sauce tasted so bland they probably got it out of a jar.  My whole experience here was terrible and I will never go back.  I work in the restaurant business and word of mouth is everything.  Well I will never have anything good to say about Rachael's Kitchen other than it is laughable that they are trying to franchise this place."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Rachel's Kitchen! Delicious food at a great price! My favorite dish here is the Chopped Salad! The staff is so friendly and always seem to go above and beyond to make sure your visit is a great experience! If you're ever downtown and looking for a healthy alternative without breaking the bank then you'll love this place!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great workers! Me & my boyfriend went in for a Sunday morning breakfast & got to play a little competitive game of connect four along with our meal. Love this place."}
{"text":"I visited this location over the weekend on a Saturday afternoon and to my surprise, it was completely dead. This was my first time at this particular location and it was a little hard to find at first. It's hidden inside of the Hilton Garden Inn near Sunset Station.

The service was great and the food was delicious! I ordered the Chicken Tender Wrap and my boyfriend ordered the BBQ Chicken Wrap. We also decided to share the Chinese Chicken Salad, which we ended up taking half of it home because the serving is huge! The dressing is to die for!

I was really satisfied with our food, however I did order an açaí bowl to-go and I was a little disappointed. The açaí base was really gooey and tasted mainly of banana. I couldn't taste the açaí at all. Also, the \"granola\" isn't your traditional crunchy granola that you'd find on most açaí bowls. I was a bit confused when I opened the bag to find a dash of raw oats sprinkled on top. 

Overall, we had a good experience here and will likely be returning in the future to try out the other options on the menu. Breakfast looks tempting!"}
{"text":"The food is OK. The online ordering is convenient, however buyer beware you need to request butter with pancakes, yeah it doesn't come with. I picked up my pancakes, got home and had to eat them without any delicious butter, for now on assume to request ice in my soda pop as well"}
{"text":"I don't really care for Rachel's Kitchen. It is simply conveniently located in places that I frequent. I only end up there because of my own laziness to try to go somewhere better which would not be hard. 

The breakfast potatoes are French fries and the Acai bowl was probably the worst I've ever had. I was tricked into thinking that it would be on par with other bowls I've had. It was not. 

However, I do like the atmosphere and the immune booster drink is really yummy. I like all of the juice options that they offer! 

I would not go here on purpose."}
{"text":"I will definitely be a return customer.  I got The Favorite. My dad got pancakes and a smoothie.  All good. Justin was super friendly and helpful.  The place is clean.  A perfect alternative to anything on Fremont Street."}
{"text":"This is gonna be 3.5 Stars. 3rd time at Rachel's Kitchen, 1st at this location. 

Rachel's Kitchen is good at leaving the guilt at the door in terms of menu. I enjoyed a light lunch of Turkey Avocado on wheat with the balsamic side salad. Some basic dining, nothing too flashy.

Everything was prepared nicely, the avocado and salad was as fresh as one would like and the turkey was your standard deli cut. There's a tangy mayo with some flavor.  Lunch was quick and easy.

The cashier was very friendly and the food came out fast during a fairly busy time of day. I'll have to update my review when I get a chance to sample more options."}
{"text":"I was very happy to see an eatery that has nutritional food choices! I was, however, disappointed to see the fast food type counter where orders are taken. I had scrambled eggs with tomatoes and basil which were great, served with yummy potatoes but store purchased whole wheat bread. Nice to have real plates and utensils to eat with, not paper or plastic. The atmosphere was pretty cold, no personality there, but the person behind the counter was polite, helpful, and very patient with another customer who took a long time to decide and order. I'll return as it was a nice place overall."}
{"text":"I love the selection at Rachel's Kitchen. From pasta and sandwiches to salads and smoothies, this place has it all-- and it's healthy! I typically opt for the Turkey and Avocado sandwich and it's always on point. Lots of meat and the avocado is always very fresh. I also love their fresh pressed apple juice... it seriously tastes like you're drinking an apple! 

It does get busy on weekends around lunchtime but, in my opinion, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried this place today, and it was very good. This is a positive addition to this area of town. We went for breakfast, and left full and satisfied. I had \"The Favorite\", a scramble with goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, avocado, and herbs. It was delicious. I love goat cheese but had never had it with eggs before, and now I am definitely a fan. The potatoes tasted freshly made and were seasoned and cooked perfectly, seriously can't go wrong with this dish. My friend had the breakfast burrito which was pretty big. She couldn't even finish half and took the rest of it along with her potatoes home. It came with freshly made salsa, and she gave it all two thumbs up. Her two grandsons had banana chocolate chip pancakes (which I was totally jealous of), and a burger and fries (at 9 a.m.--teenage boys are weird). He said the burger was nice and moist, and I stole some of his fries--yum, for sure. 

Service was fast and very friendly. The man who rang up our order and delivered our food came over to our table and talked to us for a while about the restaurant and some of the menu items. We appreciated that. I read a review that said the portions are too small for the price, but I would definitely have to disagree with that. We all had food left on our plates at the end of the meal, and we were happy and stuffed. As far as the price goes, as long as the ingredients are fresh and unprocessed, they can justify it. It's not fast food, and I don't expect to pay fast food prices.

I will definitely be back for lunch and a smoothie. I'm glad to have the addition of this type of place in the sadly ignored far N/W."}
{"text":"The watermelon juice is so refreshing!! We always go for the chicken tender wrap or the Mac n cheese. I love how they put mushrooms in the Mac n cheese, it gives it a nice flavor. The grilled veggie salad is also great! Portions are huge so two people could definitely share."}
{"text":"Service was very slow, every table was filthy and our food was cold when it was served to us. Very disappointing. They weren't even busy and it was Sunday morning. Most restaurants are packed for Sunday morning breakfast. We now know why there were so few people. Dirty tables and cold food do not make for a good experience. In addition, the staff seemed very disengaged and seemed to be \"going through the motions\"  They didn't seem to want to be there. We won't be back. :-("}
{"text":"I frequent Rachel's Kitchen a couple times a month, but last week was my first time at this location. The food was delicious and to staff was on point."}
{"text":"I love this place. Im so glad that I have this location so close to home. Love the fact that most of their meals are healthy. The location is nice and spacious inside. Even has an outdoor seating area. Its a cute spot to have, breakfast, lunch/brunch. The one thing i love the most are their freshly squeezed juices. The prices are pretty decent and so are the portions. I have no complaints with the service. Overtime I go I have been taken care of quickly and in a professional manner. I would def recommend this place to anyone whose looking for great food."}
{"text":"This location is very cute. I had the curry chicken wrap and was amazed by the spicy, curry burst of flavor! I was expecting a good wrap, but nothing as fresh and refreshing, with the cucumbers and veggies giving you the balance of flavor. The crisp, green salad I opted for was very good, with radishes, an unlikely choice in a house salad. A thumbs up on this dish! Try it!

I have been back about three times for that wrap - it's just that good!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this Rachel's for a while and get the same thing everytime, however this time the cashier was very rude and my chicken ceasar wrap was very dry and I was so disappointed"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything on the menu is delicious. Very friendly staff and AMAZING catering! The pastas here are some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Love the new location! Rachel's is always delicious! This one has a great patio and the staff is always very friendly! If you are in need of someone to cater an event all of the stores do an amazing job!!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious, large Cobb salad for lunch.  A little pricey, but very good."}
{"text":"We have eaten here now 3 times. Always wonderful food, great service and generous portions. They have a selection of coffees with almond milk, soy or regular cream the atmosphere is clean and modern with art work by locals for sale. The artwork has been different each time, so it is like having brunch in an art gallery. Recently we were at the Shriners golf tournament and had lunch at the Veterans Pavillion and it was free and donated by this wonderful small business. I say vets support this great business."}
{"text":"I'm extremely extremely upset right now!!! I ordered a vegan spinach salad and guess what?! There was bacon in it. I can't get the flavor out of my mouth after two full glasses of water. I'm not going to lie I was truly enjoying it until I hit the bacon flavor."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try something new after work. Decided on the turkey burger with sweet potato fries and was not disappointed. The meat was seasoned perfectly and the fries were delicious. I sat outside which was very relaxing, as the patio is a bit private with a small waterfall. I will be returning.."}
{"text":"I thought the food was very fresh and I loved how many options there were. This is definitely not a small cafe with only soups and sandwiches. There is a large variety of smoothies, juices, salads, pastas, sandwiches, wraps....everything! I think the prices are reasonable except for the smoothies and juices. I will say $6 for a smoothie is kind of pricey. But it tastes fresh and I would absolutely pay for another one soon! I would love to try their breakfast items."}
{"text":"I ordered Mac & Cheese.  They asked if I wanted onions & mushrooms, I said yes, and if I wanted it for there or to go, and I said for there.  After waiting for 20 minutes, I got neither onions nor mushrooms on my meal in a to-go box.  That would all have been ok, except the plain mac & cheese had no salt and tasted like warm library paste.

Come on, guys, these are easy things to get right."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! Starting with the food and ending with the amazing customer service. I always get the arugula pear salad but on days when I wanna switch it up I have a thousand options and with the help of Dee, Yami, Iris & Sebastian who take really good care of me all of the time, it's so much easier. Not to mention their preferred guest program is amazing I always get a new offer for free items. I love Rachels it's one of kind."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS LOCATION! It's tucked away in the Hilton Garden Inn, and it's such a cute location!  There's nice orange barrel seating and lovely large windows. 

The girls at the front are super sweet, and the food is delicious! I've been to other Rachel's locations, and this is definitely on-par with the others!

I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm such a fan!!! A little pricy, but par for the course for airport food. And Rachel's options are great! Healthy, varied, fresh food - I was seriously impressed. Their fruit bowl is a beautiful mix of like 10 kinds of fruit, and it's enough for 3 servings. Their smoothies are also great - I tried the \"hulk\" and it filled me up. I'd recommend this place to any hungry traveler."}
{"text":"This place is great. Every time I have been here the food has always been excellent and the service is equally as good. This is one of my favorite places to go. BBQ burger is my favorite but the club sandwich is a close 2nd."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out because it is walking distance from the hotel that I am  staying at
 My first impression? Great place! 

I was greeted before the door even closed behind me. The staff was very courteous and helpful. I  ordered the turkey club on wheat. It was absolutely delicious!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Healthy alternative to the typical highway exit fast food! Nice outside area in the shade."}
{"text":"First time trying Rachel's Kitchen and we're blown away. First off the portions are very generous leaving you with enough food for you to enjoy the next day. I ordered the signature pasta and the fiancé ordered the Chinese chicken salad. The signature pasta was hearty with lots of protein and delicious eggplant. The salad  had the perfect dressing to salad ratio and plenty of grilled chicken.  This place is a must of you want value and quality."}
{"text":"I had the Protein Lover's Scramble and it was okay, but could've been better. All the ingredients were here for a good meal, except it seemed like my food had been sitting there for quite awhile. I was with a group of 4 and the 2 that had breakfast wraps or burritos tough their food was delicious, but the two of us that had eggs thought they were dry and the cheese on top had formed that hard layer from sitting. When we walked in we had to wait about 5 minutes to place our order due to the fact that that there was only 1 person working at the register and they were putting in a giant delivery order. Our food then took awhile to get to us which I'm guessing had something to do with that. I'd be willing to try it again and guess it might be better, but this time it was just average."}
{"text":"Great place! The man who greeted me was so patient and helpful. I got the turkey sandwich on the lighter side menu and he had them make it how I wanted it and answered all my questions. The food was really good and healthy and I look forward to going back and trying more."}
{"text":"This is my favorite downtown spot. The owner's are AMAZING and so friendly. They make me feel right at home every time I'm there. This place is very child-friendly. My 2 YO is given a lunch pail with crayons and paper each time. The food is also awesome. The omelet is my favorite. And the watermelon juice is sooo good!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but so SO good!

I work nearby and tons of employees come here for the fresh foods. I've tried a few different things on the menu. I particularly like their salads. The reason for the four stars is because they did let me down once with the pear arugula salad. I'm a huge fan of this salad at other restaurants but the pears in the Rachel's kitchen salad were not ripe so they were hard and flavorless and overall the salad was a bit of a let down. I've gotten the Cobb and Asian salad and they were both AMAZING! 

I love their smoothies. I usually get the Acai smoothie which never disappoints but today I changed it up and got the Peachberry smoothie. YUM! Now I'm determined to try all of them. 

I tried one of their sandwiches for the first time as well and man, this is good too! I got the Rachel's chicken sandwich on ciabatta with a small salad as the side. You'd be surprised how easy it is to screw chicken salad up but Rachel's kitchen nails it! You can taste how fresh everything. REAL chicken! It makes a difference! Mmm!

The place is usually way packed and I always get food to go. They always pack it up nicely for me and the staff are always friendly there and somehow manage to keep it all together! If you are willing to spend the extra for the flavor and quality, try this place!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I have a satisfying and filling meal without feeling guilty or like I just indulged in \"restaurant food\". Everything is made with great ingredients, isn't greasy, and tastes like something that would really come out of your own kitchen. There's outdoor seating so it's a great place to hang out at the District when the weather is nice, or you can actually grab a beer here too for happy hour if you want to be a little good and bad at the same time while eating your chicken caesar wrap or wheat pasta.  Their green juice is awesome!"}
{"text":"Justin is amazing ! Best customer service. He was so nice. Really enjoyed the food and would highly recommend it. Super healthy. My friend jessica and I had a great time."}
{"text":"Healthy, delicious food!

The wife and I ordered a full Rachel's Chicken Salad sandwich.  It came with a side of fries but I believe you can substitute it for other healthier side options.  The chicken salad was very good.  The chicken salad had chopped apples and grapes, not something every other chicken salad has, but it was a great addition.

I ordered a half soup/ half salad.  The soup of the day was a roasted red pepper and tomato soup.  I thought it was just okay.  Good for dipping the bread that came with it.   My salad was the grilled vegetable and chicken salad.  
The salad could have used a little more of its dressing and the chicken was overcooked and dry.  

There are so many options for food here and everyone around us had something looking delicious.  There's indoor and outdoor seating and the staff was very friendly.  I'll come back again to try something new when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Just tried their Chicken Caesar Salad, and overall it was delicious. I ordered online and it's pretty simple-straight to the point. The dressing was creamy and very well flavored. They say they use non GMO chicken, it was a little dry but still well flavored. Very well portioned for what you pay. Will definitely purchase from here again."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE ???

Everyone here is so friendly service can be a little slow of there packed but I mean it is downtown and it's a GREAT place to go for lunch  

The smoothies are so yummy and FRESH it's great 
The food is very fresh and flavorful...... The tuna sandwich is yummy 

I usually come here after I work out and get my lunch I havnt been here that many times but I will be sxploring the menu? 

If your downtown check this place out"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for a catering order. Staff are very prompted. Orders are promised at the time needed, and their customer services is excellent. 

Items ordered-
Salads- Chopped and Signature
Sandwiches- assorted

All items were great! Team really enjoyed the lunch! Definitely coming back here for other items on the menu and trying out the breakfast as well."}
{"text":"excellent food including smoothies and plenty of vegetarian / vegan options. gluten-free bread available! friendly staff. love it!"}
{"text":"Great classic breakfast and healthy options. Very good food and the juice is amazing. Lacks nothing in service and the Restaurant is very clean. As an added bonus they have an awesome music selection while you eat."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food seemed good but that night my friend and her son and me and my son all got food poisoning from here. We got the Chinese chicken salad and soup and our boys had grilled cheeses. I definitely won't be coming back here and they are way overpriced ."}
{"text":"Expensive and plain, just paid 8 dollars for a protein shake, watched the girl make it wrong, and then when I said it was missing an ingredient they said \"nope\".. Took one taste and chucked it in the trash. Have been here several times before, it gets worse and worse, never going back."}
{"text":"First time going here today  

I got a little confused on the location so I did call it's in the funky looking building next to the world market center   

The lady at the front was friendly!!!

I got the spinach salad and the curry wrap 

I wasn't to found of the wrap but the salad was super yummy!!!! I'll totally go back"}
{"text":"The eggs a little overcooked but overall the breakfast was good. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the place was clean. Great music selection but a little loud."}
{"text":"Dakota truly went above and beyond to make our experience amazing. He was so patient and took the time to work with us to get exactly what we were looking for. Thank you! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"I go in to Rachel's kitchen all the time and order the grilled cheese. Not once have my mom and I gone there where they didn't screw up our order!! We always ask for no tomatoes yet one of the sandwiches seems to get tomatoes on them. It's so ridiculous considering we specifically ask them. Another thing I've noticed is the staff seems to not enjoy there job. If u don't want to be there then don't work there, but please don't walk around with a attitude. 
Overall the food is delicious, it's the customer service that isn't so great."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep returning here. The food and service usually takes forever, especially annoying because there's usually about many employees working... Standing around not doing much. The employees aren't very friendly. They don't greet you or check-in with you during the meal. I also don't like how they take out meals of the same party at different times - sometimes waiting 20 minutes at a time!"}
{"text":"A couple days ago I went to Rachel's kitchen for the first time. It was very busy and they had music on the patio with a beautiful arrangement to sit down at.  I ordered a protein shake because I was in a hurry. The protein shake came with peanut buttercups, chocolate milk and bananas with peanut utter and non fat yogurt. I asked for soy or almond milk, no peanut butter cups and add strawberries. They did just that. However they neglected to inform me that they have no sugar added so the sweetness was from the peanut buttercups/chocolate milk and when I would receive my drink it would be bland. 

After waiting 15 minutes for a protein shake I received mine blended to perfection. I tasted it and it was indeed what I mentioned previously (bland) .
I came to the conclusion myself about the chocolate milk in my computer buttercups for sweetness. Considering i.e. healthy and organic I didn't complain because the lack of sugar is good for me. However for others that go to this kind of restaurant the staff should be a little more explanatory  when discussing the ingredients in their smoothies so that other people don't get a Blance movie and then the complaining.

The menu had an awesome variety of pastas, wraps and sandwiches as well as breakfast bowls and entrées! All things considering it was a great ambience a very clean restaurant and I would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"I was stuck at home (at the Ogden) due to a knee injury and had very little ability to be mobile.  My husband was home with me, picking up the slack of the house chores since I was unable to really pitch in.  We ordered Rachel's for lunch and had it delivered to out door.  It was so yummy!  He had the Traditional Tomato Basil pasta and I had the Garden Pasta.  We even had enough for left-overs!  We also tried the energizer juice and the fresh pressed watermelon juice, both were tasty!  I love having good food in the building!  Thanks Rachel's!"}
{"text":"Ordered pancakes to go. Asked for extra butter.   Got home and no butter. Pancakes were ok but not great."}
{"text":"They are great here, sometimes better then other times. Food is always great! Service is always at least good and it never takes very long. They have great inside or outdoor seating. I love calling ahead and they always get my food right and have everything set for me when I get there. Dakota is an employee and if he's there when you eat there... You're lucky! He is very polite and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience."}
{"text":"Very delicious breakfast at a beautiful Place. sitting  outside is great. 
burritos and nachos with eggs are awesome. 
cappuccino and the juices are very good"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast, was looking for some healthy; steel cut oats, fresh smoothie and such. Had the steel cut oats....  still waiting on the juice smoothie.. finished breakfast and it still hasn't arrived!!  My traveling friend ordered 2-eggs with bacon..  eggs were just ok, she didn't finish them and they only had strawberry jam.. potatoes look like they came from a frozen bag of pre-cut breakfast potatoes.. very blah!!
Hard to find restaurant, it's located inside Hilton Garden Inn. 
If you really want fresh and healthy... keep looking."}
{"text":"What a disappointment, this was our first and will be our last time eating here. To start the girl who rung us up was very rude. We got there about 11:30 and beat the lunch rush but still waited 30 minutes for our food to come out. I order the vegetarian sandwich on ciabatta bread, when it finally came out it was on soggy wheat bread and cold fries. Christian got the veggie burger which had avocado and lettuce and nothing else on it, he also got the sweet potato fries which were also cold and lacked flavor. 
Dont recommend,  save your money, go else where"}
{"text":"My watermelon juice was tasty. The boyfriend's BBQ bacon burger wasn't anything spectacular, but it was definitely decent. Overall it seems like a nice place."}
{"text":"This place does a great job. Food is fresh at this location and they deliver downtown to our office all the time. Great for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Good lunch and breakfast spot. Great choices. I only wish their juices and smoothies were organic."}
{"text":"I've always loved Rachel's Kitchen. I usually frequent their original location in Green Valley, but I was in the area and wanted something healthy for lunch. 

They share a small parking lot with a few other businesses. So if you don't park right in front, there's a walk in store for you. Second, this location is tiny. I beat the lunch rush, so I was able to snag a table. I can only imagine the crowds during peak times. Other than that inconvenience, the food is amazing. I always get the vegetarian sandwich. It contains goat cheese, grilled zucchini, red bell pepper, onions and tomatoes. It's so filling that you would never think you were eating just vegetables. The chipotle mayo also adds a good richness to the sandwich. You also have a choice of sides which includes fries, sweet potato fries or onion rings. Their menu also consists of salads and wraps. There is something for everyone, even the picky eater. I do suggest trying one of their juices. The watermelon one is delicious and refreshing. 

I'm definitely a fan Rachel's Kitchen. I won't be frequenting this location often, but this is a definite food contender if I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"The food is merely OK. It's nothing special! The outside seating makes it. The service was lacking and the drinks weren't frozen. They actaully took longer to get than the food!"}
{"text":"Had a hankering for a fresh juice and Rachel's was the only legit place we could find in the area. Wasn't expecting it to be inside of a hotel but this place is super cute!! Staff was very friendly, specifically Victoria who helped us. The juice was delicious! Very glad that I found this place, I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My first time here... Just missed the time frame 7-11am for the free muffin with Yelp check in.  Not sure if I was starving or it really was that yummy! I had a 20oz peanut butter blast with added protein and a tuna wrap that comes with a side... I chose side salad.  Couldn't finish it felt totally stuffed.   The peanut butter blast tasted like dessert...totally satisfying.  The downfall is I have no idea how many calories it has...I can only imagine.  It's not in fitness pal and I couldn't find it on the Internet.  Wish they would list calories with their menu.   I did however find my tuna wrap w/side salad on fitness pal!  the tuna was very good however made my tortilla end soggy.  The seating was tight and during lunch on Tuesday was very packed.  They have outside seating however in 110 degree weather not my first choice. Good service...someone came around to check on us and another person came to clean up.  I'm surprise I haven't tried this place before and I can see myself going back."}
{"text":"I meet my best friend and colleague almost every week at Rachel's Kitchen on Hualapai.  The service is consistently gracious and attentive.  The manager is engaging and always comes by to check to see how our meal worked out.  The food is fantastic.  There was a time some years ago, when I was addicted to the freshly prepared parfaits (I would swing by on Friday and pick up enough for the weekend).  Currently, my favorite lunch choice is the Ceaser Salad.  Num, num!  This is a destination location!"}
{"text":"Absolutely unacceptable to wait 20+ minutes for a cheeseburger. This is why I suppose they ask for gratuity up front. Was unable to eat the meal I paid $13 for during my lunch break. Hopefully it microwaves well. Not r commended for anyone who has limited time."}
{"text":"It was our first visit and we were excited because we had heard great things about this place.  We went in the early afternoon and it was fairly quiet.  The staff was involved in their own conversation and didn't acknowledge us.  We let them know it was our first visit and asked for some ideas.  The girl at the counter just looked at us and said \"are you ready?\"  And went back to her conversation with her co workers.  The food was good but the staff needs to prioritize guests.  We won't go back for that reason."}
{"text":"good food just very overpriced! nothing really to say. Customer service was something to rave about, but the food was good."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at the Durango Rachel's Kitchen. Loved my sunrise smoothie and Chinese Chicken salad! Great menu choices and a great place to meet a friend for lunch. And we got wonderful service from Hannah. Super friendly and efficient! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to check out if you are on Fremont or the downtown strip. Music is awesome the staff is very nice. I bus just so happen to get hit right in front of this place it's very good try it !!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got pretty sick from the peanut butter banana shake. This place is over rated!"}
{"text":"Great lettuce wrapped burger!  Loved this place.  No wait and great pricing.  $13 for Bacon, Double Burger, lettuce wrapped with side salad.  Perfect Keto meal.   Great place for lettuce burgers."}
{"text":"For healthy food this is a must! If you aren't trying to stray too far from a diet or want guilt free food Rachel's Kitchen is the place! I got a sand which it was good and the ingredients fresh fresh fresh!!!! My favorite thing was the peanut butter protein shake wow wow wow.... If and when I workout or try to get on a healthier track this would be an awesome go to for a somewhat healthy dessert! It was freaking so delicious very very peanut butterery so if thats not your thing forget about this one and try another!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast scrambles and sandwiches. If this place was next to my work, I would eat here almost every day. It is really good."}
{"text":"First time at Centennial location. I tried something new to me: breakfast burrito and Sweet Greens juice.  Neither are for me. Burrito did not list onions as an ingredient but was filled with them. No real flavor to the eggs and avocado. Potatoes were ordinary. Juice tasted too much like celery for my tastes. Won't get these again. 

Typically, I like RK. Hopefully this location will be as good as the District one next visit."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a late breakfast or lunch place! The Acai smoothie is amazing and the egg scramble! Yum!"}
{"text":"I love that they have new hours. Definitely convenient to grab a delicious juice instead of coffee. The food here never disappoints. I really love their grilled cheese. Their breakfast potatoes are also a great side! I've tried a few of their juices and it's always so refreshing. I'm happy to support a place like Rachel's!"}
{"text":"Best food! Best service! I love being able to eat healthy and feel like family! So many fantastic options for breakfast, lunch and dinner!! & they have watermelon juice!! :))"}
{"text":"We got a couple items to go. I got the Cobb Salad with Cheddar Cheese instead of the Gorgonzola. It was absolutely delicious! I was nervous about the portion size die to most places that offer salads don't make the portions very large but this was a massive salad with tons of veggies. 

Mike on the other hand ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and instead got a regular burger with mustard on it. That was a bit upsetting due to him paying for a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and getting a plain one with tomatoes on it when you don't even like tomatoes. Luckily we had our own bacon at home, but that's not the point. 

The packaging on everything was cute and the nicely wrapped plastic fork and knife with the napkin neatly wrapped around them was a nice touch. 

Overall my salad was amazing and I will go back for it. It was just super disappointing not getting what you order."}
{"text":"I've heard mixed reviews about the place, but I was in a crunch and needed to have access to food quickly right after my workout. I ordered online for a 11:30am pick-up. The wait at the cashier was a bit long, but that's expected during a lunch rush. What I didn't expect was once I finally got my Smoked Turkey and Avocado sandwich and sweet potato fries, that everything was mushy and cold. I'm assuming they made my order as soon as I placed it and it had been sitting out for awhile. The flavors were there, but I was really disappointed by the state of my food. I haven't had any reason to go back since and I think next time I'm in a jam, I'll probably end up at Greens & Proteins instead. Maybe one of these days I'll try to order in person and see how it fares. 

This isn't a knock on Rachel's Kitchen, but their customers need to learn how to drive better and not randomly talk in the middle of the parking lot while cars are trying to pass through. This location is in a tight parking lot and Rachel's Kitchen is one of the first businesses in the strip mall entrance. They're always zooming out too fast, parking poorly in spaces, or backing out without checking if anyone is behind them. (sorry/end rant)"}
{"text":"Not very thrilled with these guys this visit. Ordered a Cobb salad and got more dressing than actual vegetables.  I will have to remember to ask for a much smaller quantity of dressing. Then I really hate that while paying for food or service that you haven't received yet the cash register is asking you to tip them. I will also remember next time to waive the tipping at the register and put an appropriate amount on the table when I leave.  This service was not at all friendly at the counter or after we got our food. Had to flag people down to get things that should have been automatic. And no one cared about what we thought of the food after we received it."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch here is always great.  Food is delicious and the juice bar is fantastic .  Friendly staff and comfortable environment"}
{"text":"I work in the district, so this place is right down the road.  We usually walk over to it.  I have to be honest I have only come here when I am on a work lunch.  The first time I went I got a burger with fries. It was tasty it wasn't cheap and it wasn't too overpriced.  The second time I got the chicken Caesar wrap.  This was amazing!  I mean it was just a wrap but it was a good sized tasty wrap.   I seen the other dishes from my co workers orders.  The pastas look pretty good too.  The best thing about this place is when it's nice outside you want to sit outside.  Overall the food is really good.  I have to say that the lunch prices are a little steep but at least the food makes up for it.  If you are ever in the district go grab a bite!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I ordered chocochip banana pancakes and immune booster juice.

Food
Juice-definitely fresh, nothing special same as you juice at home only the convenience when you need a quick grab and go.
Pancake-it's soft and moist but not balance tasting. I didn't like it that much and im a pancake-lover.

Ambience
Quiet and relaxing

Service
I didn't like the first reception to think they would be more welcoming since it's their grand opening. Abby was not in the mood for customer service as well the Manager(in pink shirt). There's not a lot of people to have an attitude there's probably less than 15 people? But I'm happy to have been helped by Jen who made the experience worth staying to try them out. Glad to have met Gaby as well who was so warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Best acai bowl in town. It's simple (3 main ingredients), refreshing, and always topped with the freshest strawberries. 

To be fair, I can't speak for the rest of their menu. However, when you get the same thing at the same place for several different meals with different staff at different times of day etc etc, and it ALWAYS comes out delicious, you have to give five stars. I'm a big time supporter of consistency! 

When I need a filling/healthy snack I will continue to come to this locations and continue to get the acai bowl!"}
{"text":"Gotta say this one surprised me. I was very hesitant at first to eat here but gave in. Food was awesome and its nice and relaxing. Very clean and service was nice. Even the trainee was very nice and helpful. Plus I was able to open carry my safely holstered handgun in here. Great place that will get my business in the future."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, spend your money elsewhere. I ordered over the phone for pickup. I get inside. Go to the sign marked pickup. Only to be ignored for 7mins before I asked the host. To which she responds \"oh no it's one line\". So why have a sign?! Makes no sense."}
{"text":"Love this place, I'm new to the area and this has been the only cafe that I've visited several times in the area. Everyone is super nice with great service which accounts for a lot in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wow! Love in the service, ingredients, and presentation in Downtown Las Vegas.

This is the type of place we need in Los Angeles

Great breakfast items served ALL day as well as other lunch and dinner items! I had the signature omelette it has 3 eggs, avocados, sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese! Great way to start your day.

We also had a wheat grass shot as well to top it off!

They also have fresh squeezed fruit and vegetable juices as well as delicious desserts.

If your not on the strip, you must come here for a great, healthy, meal!"}
{"text":"The service is good, the salads are decent. The free water is phenomenal! But seriously, I like the variety of salads they have. Too many to choose from."}
{"text":"Waaaaaayyyyyy too expensive. I paid $25 for Mac n cheese that I could make at home. And a tiny little turkey sandwich and a smoothie that was disgusting. 

I was looking at the prices, I was about to leave because it was so expensive for shitty food. Then the cashier was pressuring me into ordering so I said fuck it."}
{"text":"I got the chicken salad sandwich with sourdough bread and my boyfriend got the turkey bacon avocado sandwich and they were both perfect. The bread was spongy and tasted fresh. There was plenty of meat- didn't get overwhelmed with lettuce and tomato- bacon was the best I've had in a long time. We also got some juice. I got the immunization juice which tasted amazingly healthy and delicious and he got the watermelon juice -all was freshly juiced and you could tell. All of the food was super fresh and you could definitely tell with that too. I would come back. It was pricy just for 2 people ..but the quality of everything was well worth it. Eat good. Feel good."}
{"text":"I recently tried out Rachel's Kitchen for brunch, and am glad that I did.  The omelets definitely satisfied (they were large enough for both me and the boy to take some home), with nice combinations of fillings, and the berry smoothie was a lovely morning pick me up.  I also indulged with the $3 Sunday morning mimosas, the proportion of OJ to champagne was perfect.  

The only thing I left wanting was homefries small town diner style; cut potatoes cooked in a cast iron skillet with onions and seasonings.  These were the typical (fried?) cubes that the breakfast joints around here seem to love so much.  

But, potatoes aside, we were pleased with our choices, and I forsee wandering back and sitting outside eating my brunch on a warm spring morning.  I like the atmosphere and the service is always beyond pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is just fine when grabbing a quick lunch or meeting friends for a meal. 

The salad portion sizes are huge! I love it! Plenty of salad for one meal - normally have enough for a snack later on. Good quality ingredients and for the price, you can't beat it!

I love sweet potato fries. I only allow myself fries twice a month, and one of those times is sometimes at Rachel's. The fries need a little more salt and seasoning, but they're crispy and not soggy which I love. 

The menu has plenty of options for anyone who is indecisive but can't handle Cheesecake Factory sized menus. I normally get a quick basic turkey, bacon and avocado sandwich or one of their salads. Their dressings are great and don't taste like they're from the bottle at the grocery store. I heard they have delicious pasta too!

If you're gluten intolerant, they have gluten free pasta, bread, and plenty of options for you enjoy!"}
{"text":"Okay. I've tried this place 4 times now. I keep thinking that I must be missing something. It seems so popular. I've tried the tuna sandwich, two salads, and two different smoothies. 

Maybe my palate is not quite refined enough to appreciate the healthy food here. It just seems to come across bland and bitter to me. If you like \"healthy\" food you'll probably like this place. I can't seem to enjoy it though.

The worst part is that the food is fairly expensive. So I always feel like I'm paying an outrageous amount of money for something that just doesn't taste very good."}
{"text":"I order catering a lot for my work and I am always so happy when I find a place that offers great food for a great value. Liz recently helped ensure a breakfast order for 140 people was on time, set-up beautifully, and perfect. My guests were happy with the quality of food and went away full.  Plus it's so nice that they have options to accommodate almost any dietary restriction!! They made our morning and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The first couple of times that I've been here, I thought that the food were pretty good;  however,  on my last recent visit,  I thought that that the food was just okay.  The pasta was good but the chicken sandwich was just okay."}
{"text":"Just a elavator trip below my residence, Rachel's Kitchen has become my breakfast and lunch place. Food is good, breakfast is great and interior design is very hip. It's a bit pricey, normal pancakes, eggs, bacon and coffee will run you about $12 plus."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and the food is delicious.  
I had the signature pasta and it was excellent.   My date had the cheeseburger with sweet potato fries and really enjoyed it.  
I will definitely be returning to explore the menu which features a strong selection of healthy choices and fresh squeezed juices."}
{"text":"This place has a good atmosphere - the music isn't too loud and the staff is friendly. Their food is good but pretty ordinary. They make up for this by their extensive customizable menu items and selection."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Rachel's Kitchen since the original one opened up in Summerlin. Never had a bad meal there and the streak continues at the new downtown location. I'm loving this since it is really close to my place.

Today I stopped in for a quick lunch and had the Turkey burger and sweet potato fries and a Vanilla latte. The food was great and so was the service from the cashier and food runner. The vanilla latte was top notch...well done ladies!

One thing I pay VERY close attention to is cleanliness. The owner/manager (not sure exactly who she is) was constantly walking around organizing tables/chairs and cleaning the tables AND chairs. I love that, please keep it up, nothing worse than having to \"bus\" my own table and brush crumbs off the seat!  The restroom requires a key to access since this location is downtown and it shows they care about cleanliness in this department too; the restroom was immaculate and fully stocked with soap and paper towels.  I can't find any reason to rate this location anything but 5 stars...believe me I tried, even peaking into the kitchen ;-)

Thanks for opening up a location downtown and maintaining the consistency I've come to expect from the other locations!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the food, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. 

The times that I've dined the wait for the food was always very long. I now call ahead of time and eat at home. The atmosphere isn't worth the wait. 

I order catering quite often for meetings. Maybe about once or twice a month. The only reason I keep ordering from here is because he food is always a hit! The presentation is great and food is really fresh. BUT they always leave something out. I spend over $200 each time you think they would double check the order especially if i order so often."}
{"text":"We got catering from here to the Palazzo Hotel and we had the absolute best experience ever. First of all, we placed a lot of catering order during my bachelorette weekend and this was the only restaurant that actually delivered to the hotel room. 

We got the breakfast wrap platter for 12-16 people and it was perfect! I highly recommend this company if you're looking for breakfast to be delivered before a day of partying. It's a lot cheaper than any other breakfast restaurants in Vegas and plus it comes to your room so it's super convenient. Also, they include a lot of cream and sugar with your coffee so you don't have to worry about them forgetting it.

The guy that delivered the food was super friendly too!"}
{"text":"While I have been disappointed with their dry-omelette, I found new love for their smoothies.
 
Rachel's Kitchen had been my go to place for a breakfast with my girls when I need some break from home cooking. With a glance at their menu, you can tell they are focused on healthy eating. You can get most of dishes with a side of Fruit instead of French Fries. Service has been hit or miss for me...but once you initiate friendly conversation, they tend to be very nice and smiley.

Rachel's Kitchen has expanded their locations...you can find them downtown,  in Summerlin, and at the airport for example. Food and service has been average for my liking, but health oriented cooking keeps bringing me back to their convenient locations."}
{"text":"Love this place it great for a quick breakfast on a busy morning. Also the support the community as a sponsor of the summerlin north baseball league. Awesome place."}
{"text":"Great selection of healthy choices. Love that they have juice and pretty good options for gluten free. Love the new set up too"}
{"text":"This spot is much better than the Henderson location. 

This is a great morning work spot for meetings or a pre-meeting snack or beverage. The layout is cozy and comforting and it keeps the downtown vibe flowing. Plus, the service is organized and very fast. 

The food here can be either very healthy or very unhealthy depending on your taste buds choice. I only ordered a smoothie during my visit, but it was very fresh and filling. The Acaí Berry smoothie was my drink of choice this bad boy is filled with Acaí raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, pineapple, pineapple juice & nonfat vanilla frozen yogurt. This was my breakfast for the day and hit the spot, a great way to stay full and cool on the unusually warm April day. 

The WiFi here is strong and didn't stop or get funky while I was working. I began my day here around 10am and didn't until about leave until 12:15pm, which by the way, is when this place gets packed. I think the entire Zappos Staff has lunch here. 

PRO TIP: Get here before or after lunch and avoid the rush!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Rachel's Kitchen after a business meeting when I needed a quick lunch. Their menu was diverse and had something for every appetitte. I was impressed with the clean cafe and open kitchen -- there was nothing to hide. When I asked what the most popular items were, the server had no trouble telling me what was well liked by their regulars.

I went with the 404 Sandwhich. This...this was just such a delightful expirience, the eating of this sandwhich. Let's start with the perfectly grilled chicken. The server reccomended I add chipotle mayo and, man, was she right! It was the perfect kick alongside the cool goat cheese and roast red peppers. 

It came with a side choice and I went with the salad, which you usually can't expect much of. It was delicious. The greens and veggies were crisp. The dressing was yummy.

And, on top of all of that, it came out quickly and beautifully!Can't wait to go back and try more items! Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Happened to be downtown for a class and needed something healthy for lunch.  Rachel's was right down the road, so we drove over to get a salad.  I'm really glad that we did!  I had the roasted chicken and grilled vegetable salad.  I was originally put off by the price (around $14 with extra chicken) but was overall very pleased with my meal.  The veggies were fresh and the flavors balanced well.  

I was more blown away by the service.  It seemed to be taking a little while for my salad and I was beginning to get impatient but nothing excessive.  A woman came over (Rachel?  The manager?) and had the presence of mind to ask me what I'd ordered and immediately checked on it - that doesn't happen too often with takeout orders in my experience.  She was so gracious and wonderful.  Thanks for that Rachel's Kitchen - I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"We were staying at GVR and were recommended to check out Rachel's Kitchen by a friend. Let me just say we went back the next 2 days for breakfast every day of our stay! Loved everything we tried on the breakfast menu as well as the daily special Huevos Rancheros - we weren't disappointed!! Also love the free mimosa when you check in on yelp and the patio seating enjoying the lovely weather! Can't get enough!"}
{"text":"Long overdue review! I love this place and would definitely come more often if it wasn't around 20 minutes away from me. They have so many healthy, fresh options including burgers, sandwiches, pastas, wraps, salads, juices, smoothies and even breakfast options! Pricing and portion size is also really great. They even offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options. Some of my favorites include:

Smoked Turkey & Avocado Sandwich: 
smoked turkey, avocado, Swiss cheese, mixed greens, tomatoes and chipotle mayo. Served with either mixed green salad, french fries, sweet potato fries or onion rings

BBQ Bacon Burger:
1/3 lb. of ground beef, bacon, cheddar cheese, BBQ sauce, romaine lettuce and tomatoes

Garden's Pasta:
Fettuccine with sauteed chicken breast, sun-dried tomatoes, peas and mushrooms with basil pesto cream sauce

Signature Pasta: 
Penne pasta with sauteed chicken breast, eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms with tomato cream sauce

I have yet to try any of their salads, wraps or drinks, but will definitely do an update when I do!"}
{"text":"Met up a friend for lunch at rachel's kitchen because they have an outside patio and i had my little puppy with me.  It looked promising when we first walked in and i initially had trouble choosing what i wanted.  

My group ended up ordering the 440 sandwich, mac and cheese, and 2 different types of burgers.  The sandwiches and burgers come with a choice of side between fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings.  For the sides we added onion rings and french fries.  

The first disappointing thing was that we had to wait forever for just a couple of sandwiches, but that's understandable cause places get busy and it takes time to get your food.. Once we got our food I was expecting a lot more than what we actually got.. Each dish was about $10 or more and the food looked like something I could make at home in 5 minutes.. the 440 sandwich was suppose to have grilled chicken, goat cheese, avocado, peppers, and lettuce... I probably got one little slice of pepper and even less goat cheese.. the chicken was dry.. the onion rings.. they gave me like 4 little rings.. 
the other burgers and fries were also lacking in flavor and quantity.. the mac and cheese was the best thing we ordered but even that was lacking in flavor and was also dry.. all in all the food is dry and you don't get what you pay for..

.. save your money and time and go elsewhere.. it'll probably taste better too."}
{"text":"Very Very good food here. I had the Cobb Salad and it was delish!! 

I'll be coming here again for sure."}
{"text":"I'm not from this area, but my best friend lives in Vegas and every time I come visit, we go to Rachel's kitchen. I LOVE breakfast so if you do too, I highly recommend Rachel's kitchen. I've had their French toast as well as the protein lover's scramble. Both were amazing but since it was my birthday the last time I visited, I treated myself to some French toast and a mimosa. Their mimosas were made to perfection, a good balance of champagne and OJ. Really nice ambiance, really nice staff, and this place is CLEAN for being in downtown. That says a lot. Now, go eat! 

Rachael's kitchen, I'll see you in a month!"}
{"text":"This is place is awesome. Customer service is the best!!! Love the food and wine. Free wine with check in - how can you beat that?"}
{"text":"Always good with friendly staff. My favorite is the acai bowl with bananas; the steel cut oats are good too. Wish they had more vegan options but overall a nice place to sit outside and watch the (overly aggressive) birds."}
{"text":"A very nice place for lunch.   We are a couple of tourists from the east coast that found this place near Freemont street.  Abby was super helpful.   If we lived here, we would definitely come back for another visit.  We had a burger and a salad.   They we both very good."}
{"text":"Good food, I guess. But it is way over-priced and the service is pretty terrible. They're usually rude and very rarely actually get your order right. 

If you decide to eat here, do NOT pay online. Half of the time they're shoddy online system doesn't actually transmit your order. If you do order online, don't have expectations that they'll actually have your order. 

Also, always check your to-go order before you leave the store. 3 out of the last 5 times, they haven't given me the type of fries that I ordered."}
{"text":"It's walking distance from Container Park and Fremont St. I love the downtown vibe this location has. Same set up/decor and menu as the other locations. 
Orders were taken with a smile and served with another smile. My friend and I both ordered sandwiches with sides of fries. I ordered a pressed green drink. Food was right on with what I've had at the other locations. I like that- consistency- I know what to expect from a Rachel's Kitchen and that means something to me as a customer. I will definitely keep this location in mind next time I'm exploring downtown."}
{"text":"I don't live anywhere near this RK location but decided to stop by when I was in the vicinity. I do think the prices are a bit high- my green drink and veggie sandwich totaled 16$ but I do feel the ingredients are fresh and healthy so paying a bit more for a lighter meal that is satisfying and quick-- I think yes!!"}
{"text":"A nice little place to stop and refuel while you are out at the District. 
There is indoor and outdoor dining available. I like that the order was brought to the table. The staff was friendly and able to give suggestions in regards to what kind of meal we were craving.  I had the watermelon juice which was very refreshing. My grilled cheese sandwich and side salad were filling and tasty."}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times, but I have never been disappointed. Excellent customer service and ALWAYS amazing food. If you love yourself, order the acai berry smoothie and the Smoked Turkey & Avocado sandwich. Best items on the menu, as far as I'm concerned :)"}
{"text":"You ever walk in to an eatery and feel as if you entered someone's home?  Rachel's does just that.  

They have a small little place on Town Center Drive that is very clean, has friendly staff and great food.  Their chairs are outdoor patio furniture covered with different hues of blue tiles.  When you enter the staff great you with a smile, give you time to make your decision on what to eat, and help you out if you look stuck.  

I have to say that I really like their Ultimate Grilled Cheese -- three types of gooey cheese melted with freshly sliced tomato, and some home fries on the side.  Their home fries are dry, not greasy, and their grilled cheese is crispy but soft on the inside.  Overall, a great little meal that's sure to please.

Their menu isn't a book like some restaurants, but they have enough variety to make you take a few minutes to order something.  Their fresh juices are great, especially the watermelon, and they have fruit bowls and muffins for lighter fare.

Give Rachel's a try.  It's worth stopping by when you're in the area."}
{"text":"I live in a city of franchises (no thanks to all the tax incentives). Then Rachel's Kitchen pops up within walking distance. If you get off the 215 on Town Center and blink, you'll miss it. It's right next to the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.

A show like \"Check, Please! Bay Area\" (San Fran Bay Area show on PBS where locals showcase their favorite local restaurants.) would NEVER work in Vegas, but if there was a \"Check, Please! Las Vegas\" I would be on it with Rachel's Kitchen (Firefly would be a very close second). The Arugula Pear Salad $8.75 has got to be my favorite salad on the planet! It's crisp, made refreshing by the sweetness of the pear, savory with the slices of fennel, and rounded out by the bursts of goat cheese & pecans (I used to HATE goat cheese until I ate this salad. Now I LOVE IT).

The BBQ Chicken Wrap $9.95 is sweet and tangy all wrapped in Kermit green spinach wrap. The fries are real (like In-N-Out), not like the ones from McD's that have been under your car seat for years without molding.

Most of all, I love sitting outside, eating on those small tables with the mosaic tiles, and enjoying California'ish cuisine in Nevada. The food makes me forget that I'm sitting by a parking lot with no views."}
{"text":"I had seen Rachel's Kitchen for months and I always noticed there was a crowd there when I drove by which prompted me to make a mental note to try this place.  Fellow Yelpers also seemed to really enjoy it and who am I to argue with the masses?  So I headed over there for a little lunch and I too am now part of the chorus singing Rachel's praises.

The place is tiny but charming...as charming as can be in a Summerlin strip mall.  There are maybe 8 tables inside and double that outside so if you go at peak lunch hours, you may have a weight.  The menu is simple but thoughtful with a range of creative sandwiches, burgers, salads, pastas and wraps.  Perfect food for a sun drenched place like Las Vegas.  Im a sucker for a good burger so I opted for the Gorgonzola Burger and fries.  You can also get a small side salad or onion rings in lieu of the fries.  I found the burger to very good, not the best ever, but good enough to keep coming back.  The fries were average but stealing a glance at my neighbors table I saw the onion rings may be the way to go next time.  Speaking of the neighboring table, they also had salads which looked to be big and fresh.  I guess Ill just have to make a couple more trips back to see if my stomach agrees with my eyes.  

I like that you order at the counter and they bring it out to you...perfect for lunch because sometimes you dont want or need full service.  Soft Drinks and teas are also help yourself and help myself I did because when you have to sit outside on a 107 degree day, refills are a huge saving grace.  I also noticed they had a simple but interesting breakfast menu that looks worth exploring.  

Rachel's Kitchen is a nice alternative to a chain or having to go inside a casino for one of  their restaurants and all the production that comes with it.  Summerlin could use more little \"bistro\" style restaurants  like Rachel's...it really helps create a cosmopolitan type vibe that cities like Chicago or Seattle have.  Prices were a tad high, but what isnt 8-9 dollars these days anyways?  

Cant wait to take my mom here the next time she visits and I dont take my mom just anywhere so that should tell you something..."}
{"text":"This place had benefited from having a somewhat normal menu in a very hipster/trying to hard area of town. 

Prices are absurd, being it's the only place I know of to get a protein shake downtown, I have been known to grab one here every now and then. Things is, I get your standard banana/peanut butter protein shake and it's $8 bucks here when it's $5 at any other smoothie shop on earth. Needless to say, I've stop coming in.

I live downtown and I'm all for supporting local establishments, but when I go to a restaurant and ask an employee questions about menu item, I expect an answer, not, \"hold on, let me ask\". I hate that. Why don't you know your own menu, you only work there? 

I've had the turkey burger here, it was very forgettable, I've had an egg wrap here, it was even more forgettable. My wife has had the pancakes, i think she kinda liked it, but the other time we went together, she got the \"veggie burger\" or \"garden burger\" or whatever they call it and the patty was full of cheese tho the menu made zero attempt to make you aware of this. She ordered it without cheese. If you worked there would that raise a flag that this person doesn't want any cheese? And then wouldn't you want to make your customer who is paying $10+ dollar for a shitty meatless burger aware of the cheese riddled patty? The answer is no. Also if you worked there, you wouldn't have known about the cheese in the patty, cause no one that works there knows anything. 

They received an extra star for serving coke products, so keep in mind this is actually a one star review that got a much needed but undeserving boost."}
{"text":"I hesitantly agreed to eat here after reading the awful reviews on line... I'm all about healthy food so I figured we would give it a shot. The service at first was mediocre at best. They couldn't find the vegan menu but after a small search impressed me by calling another store to see what they could make me to eat that wasn't just a plain old salad. The wrap was pretty impressive. I had a small side salad and my boyfriend ordered breakfast for lunch. Large portions, they just took a little while to come out. I wasn't super impressed with the service at first and it frustrated me that I had to say something about it in order for them to have better attitudes but I am willing to give it another shot. Everyone is entitled to a bad day once and a while I suppose"}
{"text":"Perfect for everyone! Healthy menu with smoothies and salads as well as pasta and sandwiches.  My favorite is the breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"I had their breakfast burrito with potatoes & It was so delicious. They weren't busy at all and food came out fast."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.  

Our meal for 4 people. A cheeseburger. Soup. Two salads. 

Chicken curry salad. Wildly exceeded expectations. 5 stars for sure.  Highly recommend. 

Chicken and grilled vegetable salad. Solid 4 stars.  The house balsamic vinaigrette is stellar. 

Home made? Chicken rice soup. Tasted home made.  Really tasty.  

Excellent cheeseburger.  Crispy onion rings.  Very tasty."}
{"text":"Had them cater a party. Excellent food and excellent service. Wraps were favorite of most guests. Manager Abbey was great."}
{"text":"The food was okay, the grilled cheese was burned ;-)"}
{"text":"I went back and had the Huevos Rancheros again and it was delicious; fresh, healthy!  The staff was very attentive and my plate was served in a timely manner. I'll be back! Thank you Rachel's!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's simple. I like simple. It's the perfect place to pick up a quick lunch while downtown. The interior is easy on the eyes and reminds me of a bright little cafe. The menu has a selection of pastas, sammies, eggs, smoothies, salads and a 'lighter side' menu, where they keep those heathy items. The items I've had (turkey sammich, smoothie) aren't anything to write home about or to go into detail on, but they were exactly what the menu described them to be and I was completely satisfied after. Tack on online ordering, a check-in offer (50% off beer/wine) and local delivery (on awesome delivery bikes) and Rachel and I are destined to become good friends."}
{"text":"Always great . The food is consistently good and the staff is very friendly . After coming to Rachels for many years, I felt I should chime in on Yelp. the owner does a good job ensuring there food and staff are on point."}
{"text":"Their Acai bowl is icy crap and over priced asf. Go to bowlology. Don't waste your money here"}
{"text":"I had spinach salad with chicken like I usually do and she had arugula pear salad, the kids mac n cheez and juice like she usually do. The chicken was tasty and the bacon kicks that goat cheese off like whoa. I always eat my spinach faster than my toppings so I yapped the rest of  her arugula pear (all fennel and arugula by now) and twisted it up with my extra bacon, chicken and goat....

I sipped on my favorite juice...sweet greens and let Yami do her great customer service thing(like they always do). Shout out to the homie Sebastian!

I've been eating at the Trailwood Rachel's kitchen for years and it's my fav. I used to eat like shit and I credit Rachel's menu and fresh made juices for turning that around. I've eaten practically everything on the menu and loved most of it. This most recent trip was especially well executed.... so, my sincere thanks to the crew, see you for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after hearing about it from some friends. The counter and entrance area are nice, but the tables and seats are awkward and uninviting. The space feels like someone turned a patio into a cafeteria. Regardless, my group decided to order our food to eat there. 

I started off breakfast with the Skin Cleanser juice which is Cucumbers, Carrots and Celery...but I substituted the Celery with Apples, because - well, I hate celery...and it was delicious! For breakfast I ordered the oatmeal, which was a giant bowl of oatmeal with some fruit and brown sugar on the side. It could have had a lot more fruit on it, but I wasn't disappointed. My friend ordered the breakfast burrito and my dad got The Favorite. The presentation was lacking. The dishes came out with a side of potatoes, and the main dish, and it looked like it was thrown on the plate cafeteria style. At least throw some fruit on there that's cut in a fancy way, or a flower, or something that makes the dish look pretty. Thank goodness, the taste of the food made up for the presentation. The goat cheese on The Favorite is addicting, and the breakfast burrito was awesome.

Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be back to Rachel's kitchen, unless I'm ordering my food to-go."}
{"text":"Good was AWSOME. Had the tuna sandwich and sweet potatoe fries. Delish. Highly recommend this place, especially if you are keeping it healthy. Sandwich was big. Very good place. Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"I can always count on delicious food when I eat here but that's not even the best part. The service is always impeccable!! They constantly go above and beyond to create a great experience. I would highly recommend them!!"}
{"text":"I wish there were more places like Rachel's Kitchen that serve gourmet soups/salads/sandwiches.  

For value, I go to Sweet Tomatoe's, Jason's Deli, and Souper Salads.  But if I want something more yummy, I definitely head to Rachel's.

I usually don't order the same things but I can't help but order their Arugula Pear salad which also comes with shaved fennel, goat cheese, caramelized pecans in this tasty vinaigrette.

I've also ordered the Curry Chicken Salad and Grilled Vegetable. 

Make it an outting and walk the beautiful park across the street and if you go on a Tuesday, you can check out the Farmer's Market afterwards."}
{"text":"This place is great, it is a counter service little cafe place but they cook up fresh good quality food.  They have wraps, sandwiches, pastas, salads, smoothies, and breakfast.  My favorite thing there is the 440 sandwich which is chicken, roasted tomatoes and bells, goat cheese, avocado, on ciabatta.  Nothing is greasy and everything tastes fresh.  They also have a nice little patio out front to dine al fresco if it's nice outside.  It is kind of a scene being the type of place it is and being in the middle of summerlin but no big deal, there are usually a bunch of hot summerlin mom's to check out while you wait for your food.

Thew only down side is this place is a tad on the expensive side, everything from 9 - 11 bucks I think, if it was a deal I would give it a 5 possibly, there food does come with fries, salad, or rings so it is't too bad.

Overall a great place, the kind of place vegas needs more of."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen has great healthy food. Excellent salads, breakfest steel cut oat meal and great egg burritos.  I like that you can have your sandwich order as a wrap - they use whole wheat flour tortias. This location is convenient as they open at 6am. I do wish they had more soup selection though. And you can get points. This breakfest cost me $2 using my points"}
{"text":"Awful. Disappointed. The green valley location is great but this location on warm springs is so bad i wouldnt eat there for free. They got the order wrong, left our smoothies under the heat lamp, forgot my sons food and when we finally got it the order was wrong. The onions rings were burned and the rest of the food gross. The employees there are to busy cleaning their nails and checking their phones. They also over charged me and gave the wrong change back."}
{"text":"Had to wait over 20 minutes for two sandwiches! A Turkey avocado and a tuna wrap (no cooking involved). And once we got our sandwiches the fries were cold. Prices are way to high for the quality of the food and the (lack of) service. This place is a block away from my house and I'll never go back. The only reason I gave it one star was the food wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"I can sum up my experience today as \"A catastrophe of errors.\"

Walked in on a Saturday at 1pm. Three people besides myself inside the restaurant. Three employees behind the counter. I walked up to the register. I was not acknowledged or even looked at. One employee was on the phone and the other two were talking to each other with their backs to me. A minute passed and nothing. At that moment I should have realized it was going to be a bad experience. 

One employee eventually comes to the register and doesn't say \"hi\" or \"sorry for the wait\", but just says, \"for here?\"  (The one on the phone still feet away never acknowledging me).  

I ordered at 1:04pm. I ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich. I sat down. At 1:28 no food or service telling me they made an error. In that time several employees from the kitchen go behind the counter and talk relaxed to each other. Working is an afterthought to all of them. I go to the front counter and ask to speak to a manager because I have yet to get my food. An employee goes to the back and never returns. Another employee standing there eventually comes up and says, \"I am in charge right now, what's wrong.\" I said I want to get refunded and want to speak to an owner. She goes to the phone. Talks on it for two minutes and then hangs up. Then proceeds to go back to work and not acknowledge me again. I confront her and say, \"where is the manager.\" She said, \"he is not here and will be here in 15 minutes. You can wait for him.\" 

The audacity for her to suggest that I could wait after I waited 30 minutes for a grilled cheese that was never made. I walked out. I doubt I will ever return. 

I had stopped going there as often due to two previous health violations from the SNHD and poor customer service. Today solidified my desire to not return and make sure people know they have work to do."}
{"text":"Walked here after spending the morning with the kids over at the Discovery Museum. We were starving and craving something healthy! The staff was so nice and food was satisfying and fresh. It only has outdoor seating, so be mindful of the weather. It is shaded, so we enjoyed the outdoor dining. We tried the smoked turkey and swiss sandwich, caesar salad and tuna sandwich with a sunrise smoothie. Only bummer was that they were out of the first 2 things I tried to order. We will be back to enjoy lunch again!!!"}
{"text":"Very fresh food, great service.  Atmosphere is very noisy.  Recommend surrounding the juicer in a box.  This would cut down on the noise and make conversation over a meal easier."}
{"text":"Maybe have descriptions on your posted back menu
Ended up with the wrong thing because i forgot what i get is a breakfast 'wrap' instead of a breakfast 'burrito'.
Allergic to the avocado thats in the burrito and thats all my pregnant self wanted.
Ask thoroughly exactly what is in what you're getting or else you might end up itching."}
{"text":"I love the food and the service here! Julie is so sweet and super accommodating every time I dine in or take out! She makes sure my order is perfect and ready to go whenever I take out! I love the fresh food, juices and bake goods here! It's a cute and clean and everyone is helpful and the service is excellent every time. I would recommend this place for everyone locals and visitors! 5 stars for the service and 5 stars for the quality of food and choices."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is pretty awesome.  It seems to be busy a lot so I figured it would be good, but I generally have always gone to Whole Foods when at the District because I didn't know that Rachel's had gluten-free bread.  We finally tried it and then I realized that they have a really healthy menu.  I love that I can have a sandwich there with no gluten.  They also have sweet potato fries which is great for those who eat paleo.  The food was good, they have a lot of choices and a lot of drinks and teas to chose from.  If you order a water bottle though, order the small one because the big one is like a 2 liter!  They also have TV's there that play sports, so you don't have to talk to your man while you are there, or you can just leave him there while you shop.  Really good though, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Rachel's kitchen for a few years now and always had great service and food. But today when I came my girlfriend and I ordered a salad and a breakfast plate. The girl who took our order was extremely rude to the two of us. The way she was acting made us believe that she really hated being at work. Her attitude was unprofessional. Food was good though"}
{"text":"Dudeeee by far the best service out of all the Rachel's kitchens I been ! Mannnnn they give you sooooo much food ! They def not stingy with nothing and they actually don't come at you side ways like the other Rachel kitchen location workers !"}
{"text":"Awesome and quick , healthy choices with a friendly staff, have been there multiple times, very consistent!! Thanks Rachael's kitchen!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the 440 and the tuna salad.  Best tuna ever.  Food is much better dine in that take out but still a winner."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The staff is so friendly!' The food is delicious!! We eat here at least once a week. We have also had them cater a few of our parties and besides everyone loving the food! They presented it wonderfully!!"}
{"text":"I prefer this location due to its much bigger & cozier inside!! Very yummy food I recommend the chopped salad! So good! Gets 4 stars due to it being a bit pricey.... Well I guess all \"healthy\" food places are more expensive."}
{"text":"À bit overpriced. Gréat vibes because its Never too crowded. Tucked away by iHop its à very slept on breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I ordered the signature pasta for breakfast lol it is delicious, like to die for delicious omg. My friend has the egg and bacon breakfast combo and it's too 5 breakfast potatoes I've ever had. The staff is super friendly especially Vanessa  and the atmosphere is nice. Let's just say I'll be back"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found a place that both my husband and I can enjoy. He loves breakfast & I love healthy options. He was upset that baby stacks was too long of a wait for me since I had to go to work. So he wasn't looking forward to eating here. Surprisingly,  he loves the pancakes and kept mentioning then all day. Lol
I had the favorite which now is my favorite!
I forgot what was in it but it is what I would want in my omelets. Mushrooms, avocado, goat cheese.  I wish I tried the sweet potato pancake. It sounds amazing. I definitely want to come back and try everything else they have."}
{"text":"I ended up going to Rachel's for lunch because there are not many healthy options in the areas near the strip. 

The parking situation here is a pain and even though there is a spot to use a credit card, the parking machine only takes cash and coins. 

I sampled the tuna and curried chicken salad before deciding what to order. The tuna had an excess amount of mayonnaise and the chicken was dry. I looked at the menu for an additional five minutes because I did not know what to order and was skeptical because I did not think the food was up to par based on the samples. I decided on the chicken sandwich on the light menu and my friend chose the tuna even though she tried it as well and was not impressed.

The sandwich I had was poorly stacked and because the lettuce was placed on the bottom it became wilted. I did not enjoy the seasoning of the chicken which is all I could taste when eating my sandwich. My friend said her tuna was overly watery which made the tortilla soggy. She also thought there was too much tuna and additional ingredients were needed in order to combat the mushiness of the tuna.

Both times I have been to Rachel's I have found the food to be average and lazily made."}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy lunch as I drove towards Las Vegas. The salad that I got at Rachels kitchen was fabulous! On a bed of arugula and fennel, I had a super tasty tuna salad. It was very refreshing and satisfying, with a good portion size. 

In trying to find the restaurant, even though I had the address, it was a little bit challenging. The restaurant is actually attached to a hotel. I never would've found it just driving by! It was easy to park once I knew where to go, and the seating was very comfortable, in a large room with great air-conditioning. The atmosphere was pleasant, with nice background music and relatively quick service. 

The cost was a little bit higher than I would've liked, but for the quality of the food, it was definitely worth it. I would return in a heartbeat if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Sweet and comfortable spot with a nice atmosphere. Their menu has a great selection of healthy options ranging from all-day breakfast to signature dishes and smoothies. The food we ordered was delicious and I would happily return to eat here again. Good place to stop in and enjoy some food, especially on a hot summer day!"}
{"text":"Sure it's a nice brunch place at a decent price point, but aside from that, this place wasn't as great as it was hyped up to be.

I got a protein-infested breakfast. What I liked was that the ingredients used seemed fresh and tasted good. Aside from that, I'm really struggling to find what else makes this place stand out for me. There is no deining feature about Rachel's Kitchen aside from that it's busy quite often for reasons that are beyond me.

If a friend wanted to come back and grab something from here specifically, I wouldn't be against it. But I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to others based on my last meal. GIVE ME SOMETHING TO RAVE OUT, RACHEL'S KITCHEN!"}
{"text":"SUMMARY--delivery order--Rachel's got the order wrong--refused to redeliver or give full refund. Very disappointing.

After a long day at work--my kitchen being once again empty--I had a hankering for a cupcake (plus some dinner).   I searched GrubHub for \"cupcake\" and found Rachel's, located about 10 minutes from where I live. Maybe I should have driven over there. But I didn't. I ordered for delivery.

Selected that cupcake I was hankering for--plus a turkey and avocado sandwich, indicating no tomato, because I'm allergic. 

Long story short--the delivery arrived, the cupcake was missing, the driver told me the restaurant had not given him a cupcake. NOTE: I could've ordered from any number of restaurants---especially somewhere that would actually deliver a cupcake.

I called GrubHub.  Rachel's Kitchen told GrubHub they refused to send over a cupcake--apparently, they would have to pay the driver twice. I again told Grub Hub the only reason ordered from Rachel's was the cupcake, and I could easily have ordered elsewhere. It's not like the other item--a turkey sandwich (or whatever)---is that difficult to replicate anywhere else.

Twenty minutes later Rachel's changed their mind and told Grub Hub they would send over another cupcake. OK, great.  That's standard good customer service.

15 minutes after THAT I got an email from GrubHub indicating Rachel's had issued a refund on the cupcake.

Called GrubHub. Apparently although people were AT Rachel's and the driver told Grub Hub he was literally 1/10 of a mile from Rachel's, Rachel's decided NO, they would not give the driver a cupcake to deliver.  They offered me a refund (umm....duh?).  They said also I would take 50% off my \"next order\" with Rachel's.  Like I trust them now...? Like I'm champing at the bit to order from them again...?

SO then---I was starving by now---I finally bit into they turkey sandwich and....it's filled with tomatoes.   Call GrubHub again---they were super efficient and contacted Rachel's who said they were closed---and no, they said---they would not issue a refund for the sandwich I could not eat due to *tomatoes* slathered all over it. GrubHub even told them to look at the order--I had specified NO tomatoes.

It is interesting to read many of the reviews...a consistency is a mention of lack of attention to detail and a lack of \"smiling.\"  It definitely felt Rachel's customer service is not delivered \"with a smile,\" even just hearing about their decision-making re: their mess-ups with my meal.

By now...it was almost 10pm.

I had cereal for dinner. Probably better off without the cupcake---haha---but dinner would have been nice.  And tomorrow I have to untangle the financial SNAFU and charges to credit card, etc."}
{"text":"Not familiar with this area of town...being I live in summerlin...from the minute I walked in the staff was extremely helpful  (recommending items from the menu) and even received a complimentary mimosa for checking in!! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Healthy food but a little pricey.  The tuna wrap was just ok.  I think both were $10 each.  The Chinese chicken salad was better.  The lady serving us was very nice."}
{"text":"Love this place. We come here every time my mom visits. Recommend the protein scramble, veggie burger and quinoa pasta dishes. Good wine at a reasonable price and $3 mimosas on Sundays, yay! Love the location and the staff is great."}
{"text":"Awesome environment. Great food, good coffee, solid service. Justin's service was second to none."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying, I LOVE Rachel's Kitchen. I always go to the one in Centennial Hills, but I had started working in the Summerlin area and found this one and wow! First of all, they have a first responders discount which is pretty cool (as well as a military discount). They also offer a loyalty program, and the great thing about this location is they offer local artists paintings for sale on the walls! And it's changing all the time! I love that this place supports local artists! Great restaurant, great location!"}
{"text":"I love it here. The food is better for you than fast food, it's a pretty relaxed atmosphere and the employees are super nice. Plus they offer a military discount and rewards program. Since I discovered this place, I've been coming A LOT and I'm surprised it's never crazy packed! Highly recommend coming here. I usually pick up a smoothie for a little energy before I start shopping in the area."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place because I've always heard such good things. I had the chicken tender wrap and it was DELICIOUS! The tortilla it was in was so soft and the chicken was super crispy. I also loved the ranch they use in it! I was kinda bummed when they told me they didn't have honey mustard because I got the sweet potato fries and I love to pair them together. Kyle got the Cobb salad and it was super good as well! Everything it is was really fresh. Overall I would say it was a really great lunch! Will definitely be back I saw someone else's pasta and it looked yummy.  I'll have to try it next time!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Had the best breakfast! Ordered a freshly squeezed juice, and an acai smoothie that was so smooth and delicious! To top it off they were playing a Beatles album and it was just perfect!"}
{"text":"Good food, but a little noisy. I went for the first time after hearing many positive things from different people. It was packed and very crowded. I got the eggs, bacon potatoes and toast. The toast had no butter but was good. Eggs were a little overcooked. The potatoes were not that great and I'm a huge, huge potato fan. Not much flavor and a little greasy. The bacon was overcooked. If you want great bacon go to Original Pancake House.The coffee was adequate. It reminds me of panera bread, but not as good. I think this place has huge potential though. All of the people behind the counter were adequate, but not trained well on making eye contact with customer and being friendly. One stand out was a younger hispanic man with Koi fish tattoo on his arm. Very pleasant and smiled a alot,"}
{"text":"Sure nice staff! Coffee was great and the breakfasts we ordered where very, very good. They were super nice to our canine friends, too!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS ADORABLE!...

it definately reminds me a lot of my mom's old salad shop back in california. The ceilings are high and the tiled tables are round with a couple of booths on one side. They have a huge menu on the wall when you first walk in... but they also have a smaller one right infront of the register along with to-go & catering menus.

All the staff seem to work hard & try their best! Everything sounded good here so I couldn't just choose one thing... i got a free muffin for checking in & it was definately a LOT healthier tasting than I expected ahahaha.

CHICKEN CEASAR WRAP $9.95 - simple & light 

COBB SALAD $10.75 - love the size of the salad & definately come w/ a variety of flavors. Chopped tomatoes, grilled chicken sliced, Bleu cheese crumbles, avacados, bacon bits, eggs, & ranch dressing all over romaine lettuce.

KIDS PENNE PASTA $5.95 - simple penne noodles w/ tasty meat marinara sauce & the portion is enough for an adult to get full & also comes w/ a drink.

KIDS TURKEY & SWISS SANDWICH $5.95 - served w/ fruit or fries & it's served on a sourdough bread also comes w/ a drink.

BLUEBERRY MUFFIN (free w/check in) freshly baked everyday w/real blueberries. It was a bit too healthy tasting for me.

MOCHA ICED LATTE $4.50 - got this blended & it was good not too sweet overpowering in flavor

CHICKEN FETUCCINI ALFREDO $13.90 - even having this dish togo it was AWSOME probably the heaviest dish they serve but it was still not too heavy & addicting 

Overall it's a cute cafe style place to get some food that is simple & fresh"}
{"text":"I usually love RK, but the girl at the counter wasn't very friendly, and didn't even ring up my salad .  After watching my sister eat half of her meal I asked where my salad was. Oh, we didn't ring that up . Uggh, not cool at all."}
{"text":"These people forgot my order, then when they brought it to me they had cheese all over it. I'm vegan, and ordered from the measly vegan menu. I'm so over RK, and their passé employees who have an attitude of IDGAF. This is not the restaurant for that type of attitude, go work at McDonalds with that. Uggh!"}
{"text":"Shake was good , was looking forward to eat at this place for an a lot of great things but when I came and had a burger it wasn't wow and  my expectations were set to high"}
{"text":"Definitely not in love with Rachel's Kitchen, but something keeps drawing me in. 

T: Too loud
H: Have earplugs. Holy fucknuts it's so loud in here.
R: Read the menu for calorie counts. Some of the meals are in a healthy range.
E: Eat the Chicken Curry Sandwich. It's in the awesome range.
E: Eat the pasta not the pancakes. I've tasted the pasta and it is light and has a great garlic flavor. My banana chocolate chip pancakes had craters where the bananas must have fallen out or stuck to the pan. FAIL.

S: Sit in the chairs and not the bench against the wall if you have short legs. 
T: Tasty beverages. I will give them that.
A: Awesome cucumber water. Nice touch Rachel's.
R: Ridiculously loud music. Did I say that already?
S: Sit outside when the weather permits so you will have more space and won't be sitting close enough to strangers to scope their chunky earwax. 

Even though I feel they are VERY three stars I will absolutely be back several times because shopping makes this hippo hungry."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment ! I was the first one in and ordered eggs and bacon. Toast cold. Bacon cold. Potatoes a pathetic frozen pile of fried squares. WTF ? I guess this place gets rated by the lazy non- cooking fools in the Ogden condos."}
{"text":"I love Rachel's Kitchen. I am always pleased with the food and service. Great place for lunch. I come often. The smoothies are great. The Hawaiian bliss is my favorite! Also, their albacore tuna wrap is the bomb! It's not fishy and it's filling. I got the Cobb salad today and it was very good. The flavors mix well and the house made dressing is yummy."}
{"text":"Great variety of healthy FOOD! Everything taste delicious. Love that you can grab a healthy almond latte and or shake for the road. In addition, they offer a great sitting area outside."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen has a small selection wraps and burgers which are all pretty good. Where they really excel is with the smoothies. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"There were 4 people in the restaurant and it took my sandwich and salad 30 mins to be made. Ridiculous. Don't come here on your lunch break cuz you won't make it back to work on time."}
{"text":"Terribly slow service!  Painfully so.  And then the food was made incorrectly (onions when there were supposed to be no onions) and an acai bowl that was so dry I felt like I was eating chalk.  I'm not exaggerating.  It was so bad I will never go back!  When the young man gave us back our money for the sandwich that was made wrong (we didn't feel like waiting another 15 minutes), he didn't even give us the money back for the drink since we were leaving.  Classy.  And judging by the responses people are getting from their comments, I assume that Rachel just doesn't care about her customers anymore.  Good to know!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and although their food is good it is overpriced. I ordered the Acai bowl once and it was watery smoothie. Not very good at all. The only thing I really like are their salads."}
{"text":"(4) ~ very good fresh juices & smoothies...my favorite was the fresh Watermelon Juice;). Note: There's plenty of seating in the common area adjacent to Rachel's."}
{"text":"i really like this place , its clean and the food and drinks are fresh a def stop when in vegas"}
{"text":"Food: 4 stars 
Service: 2 stars 
Management: 1 star

The service is awful, but I think it's only because they're extremely understaffed. Why haven't the managers hired more cashiers? Why does management only have ONE cashier working mornings while the line is piling up 6 parties deep & 2 people are on hold for take out? 
The cashier seemed nice but stressed out and not as friendly as I'm sure she could have been if she had help at the front with her. 


Update:
I've come back a few times and ordered ahead  since I know it takes a long time to wait I store and even then I've had issues with food preparation. I finally decided to talk to a manager and she was very happy to help fix the issues. I really appreciate the good management response and I'll continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Tried the Trails location for the first time. Our visit was on Sunday for breakfast. The place was crowded with a few people ahead of us in line but it moved quickly. After ordering at the counter the food is delivered to your table. The refreshments are self serve so you can drink while waiting for the food. I guess the kitchen was backed up since the wait was longer then I expected. The nice background music and good coffee helped pass the time.
Our food was delivered with a smile and was followed up to check on our satifaction The Breakfast Burrito was large and very tasty. The breakfast potatoes (cubed) were nice and hot and the portion was larger than necessary. We will be back to try the lunch menu. This is another great choice in the Summerlin Village and we look forward to supporting a local business that seems to be growing."}
{"text":"This place is alright. I've never had anything that was spectacular or worth going back for."}
{"text":"I once passed up this location due to it being at the hotel. Don't make the same mistake we stopped in last night, easy ordering from my phone. As with the two other locations I reviewed it was excellent. My favorite is the chopped salad we also loved the grilled cheese. I wish Rachel's would contract with a food delivery company we'd use it weekly at least."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something special come here skip the chain restaurants that dot the district.  Original, delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"Service: the people that worked there didn't really seem too stoked to be working there. Not that I like working, but at least smile! The ice machine was out of ice for a while and one lady told a man that he would have to wait, instead of offering to get more from back. The other guy working there did offer to get more from the back for other customers. Food came out rather quickly after ordering, the place itself seemed clean.

Food: my daughter ordered Mac and cheese, it was not the traditional Kraft crap that other restaurants order, but it was not something I personally thought tasted very good. I had to a salt and pepper to make it taste decent (personal opinion). My daughter did eat it... My club sandwich was pretty good, I liked the avocado on it because if was freshly sliced. I would say it was just another sandwich. For the price I paid for both our meals I don't think I will be going back any time soon. It was good, but not great."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen offers a large assortment of items on their menu. I recommend their smoothies. They are very refreshing. Their service is good on most days, but I always have trouble ordering over the phone.
I ordered a chicken Caesar wrap with a side of French fries and I was slightly disappointed. The wrap was awesome. It was a good portion. But the amount of fries was sad, and I was not a fan.
I would give this place a chance again, but eating in and not ordering to go."}
{"text":"Yay!  This place is awesome! We'd been to the Summerlin location two years ago and we just ordered smoothies. They were good but the place was small and so crowded and we just never made it down that way again.Now Rachel has a place up here in Centennial. We've been in a few times and I LOVE it. So many options for those who have to be gluten free. :D  Sandwiches and even pasta can be ordered gluten free. Sadly, wraps, burgers and pancakes don't have that option. But I'm not complaining. It is so cool to have somewhere I can go and actually order a sandwich! 

Their 440 sandwich is soooo flippin good. I've also tried the smoked turkey and avocado. It was good but the 440 is just on an entirely different level. The protein lovers scramble is pretty awesome too. Very cheesy so if you are like my husband and like cheese just not A LOT of cheese, you might want to ask them to go easy.

Service is friendly, the prices are reasonable. Not really that much more than you'd pay anywhere else. The restaurant is roomy, bright and cheery. We'll be going back a lot. My goal is to try all their sandwiches but it will be difficult not to order the 440 again right away."}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place, that I had to check it out.

The people at the counter are super friendly and patient - especially since it was our first time there.

During our whole visit there, we must have been asked how we were doing at least FIVE times.  They people here really care!

I ended up ordering the \"440 Sandwich\" which is grilled chicken breast, goat cheese, avocado, roasted red peppers, roasted tomatoes and romaine lettuce. 

It comes with a choice of mixed green salad, french fries, sweet potato fries, or onion rings.

From just the sandwich I was pretty full.  I loved the peppers, goat cheese and chicken breast.  A refreshingly different kind of chicken sandwich from other places I have eaten at.

It may not look like a big establishment, but being in a corner retail space, it really opens up towards the rear of restaurant.  When I was last there, they were also building a balcony to where you can eat outside.

I hope to come back here again soon!"}
{"text":"While passing through Las Vegas, on our way to Reno, we stopped into this cute juice bar with some really cool bicycles in front. Since we had been driving all day, the nice lady behind the counter recommended a couple of 1 oz. wheat grass shots to give us more energy for the rest of our journey. She took great care to run the wheat grass through the juicer a few times to be sure she got every drop of juice out! I've had wheatgrass before but I don't remember it being this sweet. I don't know where they source theirs from but it was probably the best I've had. 

We also got a couple of their fresh juices. One with a green base of kale, spinach, cucumbers and ginger. The other had a beet base with ginger and other fruits. They were both really good and refreshing. Even my kids liked them. We didn't try their food since we were on a pretty tight travel schedule but we will definitely be back the next time we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever. We ordered fries with our meal and they were cold. I told the girl who brought them out. She only said do you want more? She never apologized and gave me a weird look when I told her. My husbands bbq bacon burger did not come with bacon. When I went to go to get a napkin I asked for a napkin and the girl didn't even say anything. I spoke with  the manger and she offered a cookie or a muffin. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Tried Rachel's Kitchen tonight for dinner and it was pretty good. I got the BBQ chicken wrap and my husband got the chicken and hummus wrap. Portions are definitely small for the price but the food was fresh and tasted good. I was not a fan of the smoothie we got (peachberry) It wasn't blended well and there was a lot of chunky fruit at the bottom. I'm glad we got to try this place but I'm definitely not in any hurry to go back."}
{"text":"I always stop by and get a smoothie for breakfast the staff is great and so very professional. I love how fast and efficient they are !"}
{"text":"Everyone is always so nice here, and the food is good.  Their fresh juices are ok.  I've had better but they are not bad at all.  What I really love here, though, is their gluten free bread!  When I order sandwiches at most places, the gluten free bread is hard and tastes stale, but I love coming here because whatever they're using, it's perfect."}
{"text":"This place is the worst!  The food is good but the staff there has a \"I don't give a $%*# \"attitude.  I waited 20 min for a salad and then when i got it - it was wrong.  I always have a wait there - even if i order and pay online.  When I called to let them know my order was wrong the young lady asked me \"what do you want me to do about it.\" Not a damn thing...I was calling to let you know so perhaps....just perhaps you can tighten up quality control.  I am not going back there."}
{"text":"I really dig this place. I always have come here because I live close by but since my life style choice has been changed to be a vegetarian, this place sticks out even more for me. They have so many options for me. Never noticed it before.
Staff was friendly like always, and place was so clean, as always lol. This place has it going, great food, friendly staff and a huge menu. You can always find something here.

I got the fresh juice with cucumber apple and pineapple. Man was it crisp and refreshing. Great flavor. Then for my breakfast I had a burrito wrap. I was only disappointed in two things. I asked for some of my egg on the burrito to be over easy so the egg would run all over the burrito. The cooked it over hard. I also asked if they could not cut it because it's easier for me to eat that way, but they did cut it \"/ the server noticed and asked to remake it but you could tell they didn't wana re make it and kinda hoped I would eat it that way. If your running food and you notice a problem you go back and fix it before it hits the table. Even though it wasn't my IDEAL burrito, it did taste good. Otherwise a very happy customer :)

Yelp check in: free muffin :)
Got a carrot raisin muffin, very good!"}
{"text":"I eat here about 3-4 times a week. Favs are the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich and pear arugula salad. Truly epic. I love the staff here, everyone is super friendly and very accommodating. The online ordering option on their website is very easy to use and convenient."}
{"text":"Was in DTLV for work and went looking for breakfast. This place was close to my hotel. I got a scramble with eggs, sundries tomatoes, goat cheese, basil and avocado. It was OK. Eggs were definitely over cooked and were tough by the time I ate them. The potatoes were on point though and cooked just right. Price was decent. Would consider going back and getting something else."}

missing ingredients.

overall rating : 1/2 star for there being enough seating for everyone dining.
...which should have given us a clue as to why it was empty & lifeless.

advice : better off making a peanut butter & jelly sandwich with a glass of orange juice 
then spend $40+tip for a 

bad / bland \"ray-nay kitchen\" experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this \"fresh\" place out! Food was very good, juices and smoothies are also great. Definitely, a good place for a quick, healthy bite."}
{"text":"I love Rachel's Kitchen! One of the best places to get yourself a healthy meal and a delicious desert. I love ordering their soup when it is available although I think the price is super steep if you aren't buying the Half n Half deal. I usually get a turkey sandwich with soup and never regret it. Lately I have been adding their brownie to my order and I love it soooo much. I do not recommend buying it if it's close to closing. The brownie could be rock hard, I was so disappointed earlier when I bought one to take with me to work it was rock solid :(. The place is normally clean and everyone is so sweet. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Rachel kitchen has been very sweet and thoughtful people working there and they make the best peanut butter blaster shakes can't get enough of those always clean courteous and fast service or recommend that place to anybody"}
{"text":"My order was incorrect and cold upon arrival. Paid twenty bucks for food and  delivery for a regular sandwich and cold fries"}
{"text":"Always good and always good for you. Consistent. The juices are pretty expensive but with the great food options, why would you want kale slime for 10 bucks any way right?"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointing: bland food, high prices, long wait and minimal service.

I walked in at 10am on a Saturday to an otherwise empty restaurant (sign?) and asked if the pastries were vegan. The waiter did know, had to ask the chef who also wasn't sure so they said they probably weren't. Then I asked if any of the smoothies could be made non-dairy and he said yes, some. After I asked about 2 possible options he seemed to remember there was an alternative vegan menu (with a handful of potential options) he could show me.

I eventually ordered the steel cut oatmeal ($5) with added strawberries and bananas ($2.25). I waited about 10 minutes for my oatmeal. My to go bag had everything I could need; unfortunately the food was not worth the wait or the price.

The oatmeal was watery and bland (even for my taste). There was 1 sliced strawberry and about half a banana sliced on top - that's it. The fruit was so flavorless I'm guessing it was frozen and thawed in the oatmeal.

I wouldn't recommend for vegans, maybe the eggs and bacon are better."}
{"text":"Yami always so nice and sweet to me whenever I walked in through those doors. This place is the best and is very very healthy and I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Food is great and the setting is chill....Away from the Vegas craziness to unwind. We ordered the Turkey Avocado Sandwich and the grilled vegetable and chicken.  Both were excellent. The portions were generous."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have amazing customer service every time I go. The food is amazing and fresh! Plus they have champagne which is a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"I think the first time I came to the location was a tough day for the employees. I gave it another try since the manager actually cared to reply to my review which I always see as a sign of active improvement on their part. This time I ordered online and the food was ready even before it was supposed to be. I was in and out quick and easy and the food was very good. Averaged out Rachel's kitchen is probably a 3.5 star restaurant but a high one at that."}
{"text":"The service the food was incredible. I haven't seen too many people with this kind of energy at restaurants. Big shout out to Justin for being kind and putting a smile on our faces. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"First stop in Vegas certainly didn't disappoint. The breakfast wrap was delicious, Justin was super kind and attentive, and my girlfriend loved that they had a juice bar and had juice that wasn't a super sugary, fruity over load but instead a savory and spicy green juice. 
Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"We stopped in at Rachel's Kitchen for breakfast, largely due to positive reviews on Yelp and in the local press. We couldn't have been more disappointed in our experience, and I am frankly shocked that anyone could write even a lukewarm review about this place. 

First, we found out that the advertised maple syrup was actually a sugary faux-syrup. Then the food arrived, and there was one disappointment after another. The acai bowl was room-temperature and lacking flavor. The steel cut oats were grainy and tasteless. The tea tasted wholly of paper cup. The old fashioned oatmeal was gummy. The employees were undertrained and the floor was covered with detritus and trash. Finally, my son developed an immediate stomach ache after eating the old fashioned oatmeal. 

I warn anyone who loves who loves good food, thoughtfully prepared, to avoid Rachel's Kitchen."}
{"text":"It was awesome, we had pineapple juice, veggie burger and signature pasta and everything was just amazing. Would definitely go back again !!"}
{"text":"I love their food, but their awful music keeps me from dining in."}
{"text":"So i went to rachels kitchen last night to grab 2 acia bowls for me and my girlfriend. That was honestly the worst thing Ive ever had in my entire life. There was literally a cup of granola in there. It was really gross and everything was melted and disgusting. If you come to this place do not order the acia bowl.

Can't wait to get a response from the person who runs the yelp saying \"sorry for this, we will tell the staff blah blah blah\""}
{"text":"So Rachel's Kitchen serves breakfast all day, so of course I had to try their pancakes; so phenomenal. My boyfriend ordered the bbq chicken wrap, and it hit the spot. They also offer soup, pasta, salad, and sandwiches. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Where do I start the soup very Bland no taste.... and broccoli slaw is not chat broccoli salad broccoli slaw is broccoli slaw you call it salad but it still is slaw turkey avocado Club very weak on the lettuce and the fries rubber"}
{"text":"YUM! Not sure if the quality of everything on the menu is the same as what I've ordered, but if it is, then YUM!

The \"Favorite\" was just so damn delicious.. I love Goat Cheese so that really topped this off. Avocados too?? Can't go wrong with that. The side of bacon I ordered, delicious as well. (but all bacon is good bacon, right?)

Will definitely order from this place again. (got this delivered, so maybe I'll dine in next time.)"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place as my friends had raved about it. I got a to go order with the curry chicken sandwich and a side salad. The sals was thrown into the same container as my sandwich and the sandwich did not taste good at all. Of course I didn't realize until i got home, otherwise I would have taken it back. So sad :("}
{"text":"Where to start, you walk into the restaurant and it's very well put together. The color theme along with the decorations and sitting tables with chairs are all very warm and welcoming.
I walked up to the counter to place my order and after having to wait several minutes for the cashier to get off a personal call to take my order I was already wondering if  made a good choice of going there, but from all the wonderful Yelp comments and suggestions I waited patiently. 
I ordered a kids Chicken Fingers with Fries for my little 2 year old and a Mac and Cheese for myself, with our drinks the bill came out $19.85. Hmm a bit pricey if you ask me for small meals. 
We sat by the window and waited, there were only 4 other couples in the restaurant waiting for their meals as well (which came in after us) but we were for some reason we were the last ones to receive our meal after waiting 28 minutes yes I timed it. I think the waiter realized that we had to wait a while and that my little man was really hungry since he ate his chicken nuggets even though they were still very hot, she offered us a cup cake and apologize for us having to wait. 
My Mac and Cheese was good I couldn't believe the portion size since it ended up feeding my little boy and myself with still a little bit left over. The chicken fingers and fries umm not so good, the Chicken was hard and was very Tuff my little man didn't eat much of it and his fries were soggy which he also wasn't too interested in. 
After being home for a few hours my little man had the worst upset stomach to the point I had to give him some medicine to calm his stomach and had to stay with him till he slept ( which is never needed for him). An hour after I started feeling the same stomach pains and both of us were sitting in the bathroom holding our stomachs and throwing up everything. I ended up having to take him to our local grocery store at 11 pm to get us something so that we could get some rest before our busy day ahead of us.
Therefore my rating is only 2 stars, Staff each probably could learn more customer service skills and the food well I won't be eating there anymore. All in all the concept of the restaurant is nice and the ambiance but that's about it."}
{"text":"As a result of our negative post, a representative from Rachel's actually reached out to us to offer an apology. This is a GREAT way to do business. Listen to your customers and respond to them!

Here is a condensed portion of their reply: 

\"Anthony,

On behalf of Rachel's Kitchen, I sincerely apologize for the experience you and your wife recently had at our Warm Springs location.  We always strive to please our guests with fresh and wholesome food and outstanding customer service; unfortunately, it seems like we fell short this time.

We've reached out to the Warm Springs staff to get a better understanding of how your experience unfolded, and Victoria, a FOH manager, would like to offer her apologies as well.  She not only remembers the details of your visit but shared in your frustration at the misfortunes.  She's putting together a plan to make sure our staff is better aware of checking on things like cold coffee, frozen butter packets, and incorrectly prepared meals.

................ First impressions are lasting impressions, so we understand if you feel some trepidation; nevertheless, we do hope you'll accept as we'd love a second chance to prove to you those great things you heard about us are true!

There was an offer attached to this reply, which I did not include here.

So, on behalf of my wife and I, Thank you for reaching out to us and offering to make it right. But more importantly, we appreciate that you contacted the restaurant, spoke to the manager, and took steps to correct the small oversights for future patrons! 

Anthony"}
{"text":"The food is amazingly fresh!! The service is awesome! Thanks Dakota! The breakfast burrito is sooooo yummy, banana chocolate chip pancakes rock!"}
{"text":"Tiny little haven of good food and smoothies in an airport! I found this in the D gates.

Happy, smiling, super-efficient staff cranking out the good food.

The Hawaiian Bliss smoothie is delicious with pineapple, banana, coconut pineapple juice and frozen yogurt.

Egg white or egg and cheese hot breakfast sandwiches (lots of cheese, so stick to the cold sandwiches if lactose intolerant). The eggs appear to be egg beaters. I'd give these sandwiches a pass in favor of the other, better options.

Fresh tuna salad, curry and other sandwiches with what appear to be an aggressive expiration for freshness.

Salads, yogurts and fruit, fresh squeezed juices.

Oatmeal with fresh berries comes with little cups of brown sugar.

Peet's coffee, organic green and passion tea, real lemonade and the best smoothies around, with or without vanilla yogurt.

This place is great."}
{"text":"Hi first off this review is based off customer service not the food.. Food is amazing. I  am a regular at Rachael's. Today however I made my order the server was extremely rude to me, short and nasty I was very offended that she treated me this way and treated every other customer as gold.. Why did she treat me this way I have no Idea.. Isnt my money as good as the next? Lady quit discriminating and get an attitude check!"}
{"text":"SO beyond dissapointed  with Rachels Kitchen. I placed a delivery order at 11:15 and was quoted a 30 minute wait time. When we had been waiting 45 minutes I called to find out if they were on their way. A very rude guy answered the phone and said my order had been ready and was waiting there to be picked up. When I said it was for delivery he said \"No its not\" and hung up on me. I called back only for him to answer again. He placed me on a 11 minute hold and the woman who answered said they would remake my sandwich and 2 juices and send them right out. It is now 12:45 and I just called back to find out they had not been sent out yet. What a fail! So dissapointed Rachels Kitchen. Get your ish together."}
{"text":"I've been to Rachel's Kitchen twice and both times were very enjoyable. The first time I had the cobb Salad (several months ago, back when gluten and dairy were part of my diet) It was delicious. I ate it out on the patio and enjoyed the nice April weather. 

I ate here for a second time this weekend. I ordered the Angel Hair Bolognese with gluten free pasta. It is a homemade meat (beef only) sauce. It was really quite good. I also ordered the Malbec. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this place offered wine. This time I sat at a table in the back and I was happy to find that they had a outlet near my table, excellent for charging my always dead phone. 

So far both times I've come in alone... I think next time I'll bring my tablet and catch up on my book, rather than sit on FB/Yelp the whole time. ha.

I wish they had a few more gluten + dairy free choices... but I'm sure I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Really good food... If you go there, you have to try the \"SUNRISE SMOOTHIE, and the\" HASH BROWNS\". They are to die for."}
{"text":"Too bad there are no 0 stars. They totally deserve the worse rating ever, I used to love this place and now I'm just fed up with their bad customer service and lack of accommodation. Every time I call to place an order I'm placed on hold for a long time just to find out that they \"can't do the grilled cheese sandwich and soup.\" I used to get the half sandwich and soup combo and the soup came with a side (three small pieces) of bread, I spent almost $20 dollars in just one meal just to be told \"we don't do soup and bread.\" That's it, I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Such an awesome place to come with friends and enjoy a meal. I love the food and the environment from this place. I recommend almost anything on menu!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the fuss is about - I thought the place was okay at best. The food was a little odd in recipe (not bad or anything, just different and not great). 

For example, the mushroom burger apparently comes on multigrain bread, whereas one might expect it to be on brioche at most restaurants. I understand that there is maybe a health-bent to it (and hey, I'm from Santa Monica, so all the more power to that!), but I certainly never got the impression that I should expect it to come out like that. The breakfast omelette too came out, well, just fine. 

Again, it's not something that I'd consider that terrible, but I just definitely think you have other options available, being that Vegas is Vegas and all. So why not go to those places?

GOOD: healthy?, free wifi, clean bathroom
OKAY: almost all of it
BAD: umm...odd bread choice?"}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars from me!  The service is always exceptionable. The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. I usually get the chicken wrap.  Portion sizes are above average.   Recently, I signed up for the rewards program and the girl remembered me from the previous week and added extra points to my account without me even asking her.  I thought that was good. Another time, I wanted home fries and I was not charged.  The parking is easy here.  Also, they have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Went today with a coworker for lunch. A lot of things sounded great, but the prices thru me off. I ended up getting a turkey avocado sandwich on sourdough with onion rings. The sourdough was not sour at all. It was like stale, thick cut white bread. The veggies were good and fresh, chipotle mayo was tasty, the meat was like cheap deli meat from the grocery store. For $10, I would have expected better meat and bread. I could have made a better sandwich at home. The onion rings were crispy and not greasy. My coworker had the turkey club with french fries. She also ordered it on sourdough and was disappointed in the bread and meat. She said it was the worst bacon she had ever tasted. How do you mess up bacon?! She said it tasted metallic. The fries were completely bland. No seasoning, not even a small sprinkle of salt. I would return to try something else if it wasn't so damn expensive. For $10 I can get better food, with a drink at Panera around the corner."}
{"text":"Curried Chicken salad or sandwich is good. Bar-B-Q chicken wrap is also a winner."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation and we were happy with our 1st visit!! 

Food:  Chicken Caesar Wrap was delicious! The balance of chicken to the salad was great! Not too much greens where you can't taste the chicken! Or, drippong with dressing. Love it 
Onion Rings had too much batter, otherwise I think it would be more tasty  
Fries: Skinny fries were good  

Service:  Staff was friendly and didn't give you an attitude when we asked to have our table wiped  We were sitting outside! 

Summary:  We will definitely return to eat here!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch later today and was undecided for lunch and ended up at Rachels. Timing is inconsistent. Some days it's faster and then other days are just so slow. 

At work, we get a lot of staff members visiting from other offices. I remember hearing one of the visiting directors that Rachels is always so slow. We can put in a phone order and still have to wait 15 to 20 minutes for it to be ready. By the time we bring the order back to the office, we have 5 to 10th minutes to eat before we have to go to our next meeting.

So although the kitchen needs help in their productivity, the front counter staff members are great. Prices are a little higher. Salads, sandwiches, wraps are good.

Today, there was no line when i arrived. I ordered the chicken tender wrap with fries. It was good as always but waited almost 20-minutes for my order.

Rachels, I recommend to work on your timing in the kitchen. Once I see the consistency, I will be more than happy to bump up to a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"3 stars is almost generous. I got the 440 sandwich. It had a paper thin slice of chicken. The sandwich was 95% bread and tomato. The sweet potato fries were just average. A Tommyknocker imperial nut brown for $4 is not bad, though. It's funny, I was on jury duty this day. I ran from the courthouse to this place to try it out and ran back. I would be reluctant to give it a second chance on the food. Happy hour might be a reason to come back, but even then, why would I? There are plenty of other, better places to get a drink. Too many options downtown for me to see myself going here again."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend always come and eat!
They seriously have the most healthiest food here, this restaurant has a great set up and vibe the people who work there are super sweet and kind. 
I lost count of how many times I've ordered food to pick up, I absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"At 10 in the morning you really don't want to eat fast food. So I spotted this place and all the juices and smoothies are ALL NATURAL. Made with real fruit straight into the juicer. They also have fruit bowls, salads, and chicken sandwiches. I had the spinach salad with this lemon vinergarette ....must try !!"}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is becoming a favorite Downtown lunch spot for me. I normally will come here when I want food that's tasty, healthy(ish) and that will keep me satiated throughout the workday.

I usually order the Chicken Caesar Wrap with a side of their sweet potato fries. Like the name suggests, it's a Caesar salad in a wrap. They don't get greedy with the chicken, which is sliced thick, and the contents aren't drenched in dressing. What I like especially like about the wrap is the option to substitute the flour tortilla for a wheat tortilla.

Their pecan and chocolate brownies are sweet and fudgey. They're a little on the heavy side, but they make the perfect, shareable desserts to top off a meal. 

Lunchtime is full of diners, making it difficult to find a seat. Plus, parking can be bit of a pain. Although, you could place an order for either pick up or delivery. 

Rachel's Kitchen is a great addition to the handful of local restaurants in Downtown that serve food that's delicious and made-to-order."}
{"text":"Running on an empty stomach, I chose to ditch grabbing a coffee to go and instead went for a smoothie at Rachel's Kitchen. 

I enjoy a good smoothie, but I tend to be picky. Added sugars are a big NO for me, and I'd much rather have my fruit smoothies sweetened naturally; in the words of Marge Simpson, \"Fruit is Nature's Candy!\"  I was told by one of the cheery staff members that there are no added sugars in their fruit smoothies (yes!), so that's a huge plus! I ordered a large Acaí Berry smoothie for just a little over $5.00. It's a blend of non-fat yogurt and several fruits, including blueberries, pineapple, and strawberries. It was neither too sweet nor too tart; perfect for a light breakfast or snack.

The Peanut Butter Blast smoothie is on my \"next to try\" list as well as some of their actual foods, like Curry Chicken Salad."}
{"text":"Ordered from y'all and will continue to! Whoever delivered the breakfast I surprised my boyfriend with this morning, I know it was Uber but still - you rock! And he loved it :) so thank you! Also met with John, the owner, who came into my work (TWC Construction) handing out menus and he was just as sweet as could be! So staff is great, foods even better, if I could do more than 5 stars I absolutely would! I've yet to have a meal from here I haven't liked and you can't NOT order anything without the Incredible Hulk smoothie :D"}
{"text":"Ordered from here two days in a row and absolutely love it !!! The incredible hulk smoothie is a new fav and once I try everything on the menu, which I intend to, I'll choose a favorite dish! I've had the Cobb salad - sadly it was missing avocado and that's what drew me to it but still amazing and then today I got the chicken tender wrap. L O V E  I T."}
{"text":"I was in here recently for breakfast the other day.  The banana and chocolate chip pancakes were very good.  I'd like to try them again sometime for lunch. Rachel's that is, not the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Love Rachel's Kitchen. Right down the street from where I work it's easy to call in and run down and grab. Veggie burger is delicious! Everyone is super friendly both on the phone & in store. One day we will actually have the time to sit and eat there. It always seems busy so I'm sure it's time I try some other options on the menu. Thanks Rachel's for being the perfect neighborhood go to!!"}
{"text":"Pricey for salad.  I got the grilled vegetable and chicken salad.  Veggies were grilled but cold.  Chicken was luke warm.  I was disappointed in it overall. Friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"As much as I myself enjoyed Rachel's, keep in mind the health factor. This place while delicious and menu offering quite a delicious range will not satisfy a salty, greasy breakfast palate. They have pretty organic straight forward meal options. For me....happy gal. Others in my party felt it bland but I think it depends on what your looking for. They offer straight healthy juice options, smoothies and sides are pretty original as well; that saying sans salt, seasonings. If your on board with that then give it a shot, my turkey/avo sandwich was awesome! So were my sweet potato fries. Should you be looking for an original breakfast with hash browns regular coffee and table side service...keep trailing on."}
{"text":"Signature pasta- 2 yuck :(
Steel cut oats- 4 :)  
Lemon cranberry muffin 4 baked daily
Reasonable prices, conveniently located in the lobby"}
{"text":"Wow, again! Imagine a Subway where everything was truly fresh and healthy! Can you??! Yeah...me neither. However, Rachel's Kitchen in Downtown LV, can at least give one hope for mankind.
I travel and in the US, especially LV, in the sea of All You Can Eats, Fried Meat chains, and 14 for 1 pizza, it's even more difficult to find heathy options. I'm not a vegetarian but like to eat plants when I can on the road. I often search out Vegan restaurants just for healthy options, like I did the previous night. Once again I left such a place disappointed at the lame choices and basic lack VEGETABLES in my $35 VEGAN plate of tasteless hipster feed. 
I'd eaten breakfast at Rachel's last year and just recalled being stuffed(!). Swung by this time for a lunch sandwich or something. WOW! Forgot the great choices offered! Ordered the smoked turkey/ Avo sandwich and took a chance on the side salad. No chance whatsoever with this choice! No typical US 3 leafs of iceberg/2 tomato wedges, and a crouton smothered in bottled Ranch, here!!! Hallelujah!!! A base of dark leafy greens, diced tomatoes, nice pile of julienned carrots, cucumber slices, with a soy based sauce (I think). Awesome! But, I'm pretty sure even my turkey sandwich had more vegetables on it than my \"vegan\" meal the night before! Nice pile of dark, fresh greens, tomato slices, and the avocado. I'm really not exaggerating. Even two choices of fresh made iced tea. Feeling healthy and stuffed again. I'm looking forward to breakfast here tomorrow before heading out."}
{"text":"This location is headed in a poor direction. The foods is ok. Nothing wow's me here anymore, but I haven't had anything so bad I sent it back. 
My complaint is that they have a major pest problem with the pigeons in the patio dining area. They have never bussed tables quickly here, and the birds have learned about it. Nothing grosses me out more than having these rats with wings dining at the table next to me. It ruined my breakfast this weekend, and the staff was not quick enough to fix it when it was brought to their attention. I'm sure if the Health Department was there when this happened it would have been a problem.
Clean it up Rachel's! You were better than this."}
{"text":"Rachels Kitchen was catered at my organization for a lunch meeting.

The food was good, tasty and the service was timely and I would order again. 

Fixable issues:  lacked plates, napkins and utensils. We ordered for 20 and got
10 everything.

Learning point:  the dessert tray had three different desserts all stacked on top of each other.  They stuck to one another so you ended up with globs of chocolate brownies stuck to a lemon tart.

I recommend this group - just ensure specifics when ordering."}
{"text":"I found myself really unexpectedly disappointed in Rachel's Kitchen.

All of the other locations get great reviews but I failed to see where all the hype comes from. The Ultimate Grilled Cheese... was not very ultimate. Thin-sliced white bread, some cheese, a couple tomato slices. I expected thick crusty bread and really quality cheese... what I got was like, boring kid's menu grilled cheese. I could have made something way better for myself at home for wayyyy less than nearly $8.

The french fries and breakfast potatoes are not made fresh, they are frozen. The turkey on the turkey sandwich isn't a nice piece of turkey breast, it's boring lunch meat. They use a light hand to apply seasonings so there is not much flavor.

The service is really friendly, though. That and the smoothie I had are the reasons I am giving 3 stars instead of two- the peanut butter blast is delicious and the non-fat yogurt it's made with at least gives me the illusion of eating healthily. Since this location is literally right downstairs, I will probably stop by in the future to pick up a smoothie, but there is nothing on the menu that I couldn't make a tastier, fresher version of upstairs for way cheaper."}
{"text":"Sorry Rachel, I have enjoyed your restaurant for years but not anymore. Tonights takeout dinner of Cobb Salad and kids Chicken tender meal was indescribable.  The Chicken tenders were so over cooked that it no longer resembled meat.  Cold fries, chicken on the salad was like cardboard. This happened about a month ago too. I think you may need to check on your cooks."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is its focus on healthy eating. I had a delicious turkey burger and didn't feel an ounce of guilt about it. My burger even came with a side of onion rings. I got three large rings: just enough to cure the craving without eating my suggested daily calorie intake in onion rings. 

The menu was huge and there were lots of things I wanted to try. I'm so excited to go back and try one of the salads I saw being served to other customers. They looked delicious."}
{"text":"We loved sitting on the patio yesterday his place was very flavorful and the staff was friendly! The ambiance is great and you can walk to the stores and green valley ranch after without moving your car."}
{"text":"I was happy with my food purchased at this location.  Even though it's basically a kiosk type arrangement I think it's still the best place for a meal at McCarran.  The signature salad and smoked turkey & swiss sandwich was $20.57 with tax.  Even if departing C Gates it just takes a few minutes to get here.  The location is on the directory in the middle of the food area...so easy to find.  Rachel's has 4 or 5 other locations in the valley so I was glad this one is at the airport.  Looking forward to my next flight!"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients, great variety and super friendly. Our family has tried soups, sandwiches, juices and salads all delicious. Great all around daytime food and environment!"}
{"text":"Skip this location at all costs. The Hualapai location has hands down better food and employees. The food at this location is always sub par, and the staff is ALWAYS very rude, short, and cold. I LOVE Rachel's Kitchen, but this location gives RK a bad rep!"}
{"text":"Ive heard such great things, so I expected great things. It was good, but not great.

To start, I understand that while people are preparing others foods, when you see two people standing there waiting to order, the least you can say is, I'll be with you shortly, or someone will be with you shortly, or hey, go screw yourself.....something! That kinda put me off, but whatever, I'm hungry, let's eat!

I ordered the grilled veggie salad. I was disappointed it didn't come with more veggies. The ones that were there were delicious! The roasted red peppers were not. I loathe jarred roasted peppers. Take the time and toast them yourself, it's easy and not very time consuming. I will say it was a nice sized bowl of lettuce, I liked that. The dressing was OK, definitely could have used some more, but I wasn't about to go stand there like an idiot again and wait for it.

My friends ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and a wrap. They wrap the wrap in lots and lots of paper. It took her some time to get it off (pervert, I know that you are thinking!). They also ordered 2 smoothies before the meal. One was a peanut butter one and it was tasty but too thick, especially for the straw they provide. The other was a banana kinda smoothie that while I dont dig the banana taste, it was much easier to enjoy.

My company, the absolutely FABULOUS Christina and Arvin, made the meal fantastic. I always have the best time with them and enjoy every minute!

I'd definitely try Rachel's again, I think I'm going for the grilled cheese next time. Sounds good.

Prices were Ok, service was........eh, and food was good enough for a return visit!"}
{"text":"This growing chain has some decent food when you need a quick meal in a pinch. They've got some healthy options, but I always go for the bad stuff. Like the chicken tender wrap with lettuce, tomatoes, and ranch and a side of fries. They have kid options too, like penne pasta. My kid got it with just butter and cheese and unfortunately it was drowning in both -- like a soup made out of butter. The chocolate cupcake was perfectly moist and chocolatey, but the pecan bar was dry, crumbly, and cold."}
{"text":"For a franchised business, this location is pretty good. I stayed in the attached hotel when traveling and wanted a quick bite with outshine to go out. Had a very basic Caesar salad but it was a large salad. It was also much nicer than your standard hotel continental breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"I'm just not into this place anymore. I was so stoked when it was being built and even after it opened I was a weekly regular. With nearby options like Burger King and McDonald's, I was excited to have a place that would be different and have a variety of menu options. The online ordering is pretty much useless. I place my order online because it is supposed to be convenient yet I still end up most of the time waiting in my car and having to go inside and get my food only to find out it isn't even ready. I have no issues with going inside and ordering something and waiting for it, but when a place offers online ordering so that you don't have to do those things and cut down on wait time and can't get it right it becomes useless. Then when I finally get my food it is overcooked. This wasn't an issue when they first opened however maybe because they are expanding around town too fast consistency is an issue. This last time my Omelet was yet again crispy and brown (overcooked) and hubbys breakfast burrito tasted awful (we used to eat these a couple times a week) and the tortilla was hard and the pancakes had a burnt flavor. The potatoes that came with my breakfast were dry and clearly came from a frozen bag. A lot of people think this is a \"healthy\" only food establishment... Wrong! After too many failed attempts... I give up!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Rachel's Kitchen, but honestly I was underwhelmed. The BBQ chicken wrap was bland and a little dry. I almost always clean my plate but it wasn't worth it to finish the whole thing. The sweet potato fries were decent, though. The grilled vegetable and chicken salad was drowning in dressing, rendering it almost inedible. The pancakes -- advertised as being light and fluffy -- needed to be lighter and fluffier.

On a Saturday morning and afternoon it can be tough to get a table as much of Summerlin descends upon this place. We lucked out and got a table right after we ordered. Too bad the food wasn't worth it. I may go back to give them another shot because other items on the menu sound good. I just hope I won't be disappointed again."}
{"text":"First time visiting Vegas and we were looking for a good place to eat. Came across Rachel's Kitchen. The staff is super inviting. I love the music that's playing, too. Food was delicious but my favorite thing about my visit were the 2 awesome girls who helped us. Both super friendly and smiley and talkative. If I ever visit Vegas again I'll definitely be stopping by here again!!"}
{"text":"It's 4 stars out of 5 each and every time. Very consistent. Close to home, easy carry out, good environment. BETTER environment would make it a 5 star. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I probably eat here on average once a week, sometimes more. And it's normally always takeout and only once has some part of the order gotten messed up by a side being left out.  

One morning we did an online order for breakfast, went to go pick up, and they apparently didn't get our order. They went ahead and took it, pushed it quickly through the kitchen, and we got a follow-up email from the manager offering us a free meal. We never complained or asked for it, so it was kind of like a surprise Christmas present.

Our go-to eats: Signature salad, 440 sandwich, club sandwich, and the fruit bowl. Their breakfast wraps are great, too. We did have a friend order the curry sandwich or wrap one time and was not impressed."}
{"text":"The service here is so much slower than the Centennial location. You would think being in a busier area of town it would be the same if not better service. The food is always good, I just wish I didn't have to wait 30+ minutes for the food."}
{"text":"I tried this place twice and the service was so terrible that it didn't matter how the food tasted.

Both times the wait to order was 8-10 minutes at the register, the staff was unfriendly and had no sense of urgency in getting orders out. 

The orders both times took 20+ minute. One time it was only smoothies we ordered. 

They brought the items out one at a time with long delays in between so everyone was served separately.

I enjoy the one in Summerlin but will never go here again."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was not. Very bland. Had the breakfast burrito and vegy scramble. Won't return."}
{"text":"I am usually a fan of Rachel's Kitchen however this time left me very disappointed. I ordered the 2 eggs and bacon meal with a side of fruit to go, and it wasn't until I got home that I didn't notice it was missing a key component...the bacon. The staff looked like they were too busy talking to each other and playing around to ensure a correct order."}
{"text":"not bad...sandwich was okay.  sweet potatoes good but no dip worth eating.  would not go out of our way to eat there...but it was okay for that day."}
{"text":"The food is always great and the service is 2nd to none. The staff is helpful and super attentive."}
{"text":"9/4/16.  This was the 2nd chance.  And they failed.  6 months have passed since my last unsuccessful visit.  Same issue both times.  Asked for one of the juices on their menu - Sweet Greens.  When made, its great.  The 3 employees behind the counter apparently had no idea how to operate the juicer.  The gal making my juice put the lemon and cucumber and ginger through the juicer, and then CRAMMED 6 cups of kale (2 2-handed large handfuls that she had to literally CRAM through the top of the commercial juicer) and lo & behold... NOTHING CAME OUT!  Ok, maybe 2 drops of \"green\"  -- so instead of thinking.. hmmm.  I need a liquid, she jams in about 2 cups, maybe 3 of spinach leaves.  And guess what... same result!  At this point I interceded and pointed out that she needed to put a fruit or veggie in like a lemon or a cucumber - something with some water in it to loosen up the kale and spinach.  The 3 of them behind the counter looked at me with complete blank looks.  They didn't understand -- the response was \"oh, do you want me to re-make it?\"  Keep in mind... at this point the juice looks like apple lemon juice -- no green to it at all.  I said, well, you need to do something to get the kale and spinach into the juice, try an apple - and literally, a blank look from all 3 asking again \"should we remake it.\"  I said NO and left.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"They serve delicious smoothies. Sandwiches soups or salads. They have sweet potato fries and breakfast all day. I love coming here for a fresh and healthy lunch."}
{"text":"I don't know why theirs so many negative reviews...but every time I come in the girls in the front counter are always nice every time I come in..they know my order (which is chicken Cesar wrap) and it's delicious as always! Thank you Rachel's kitchen and the girls in the front the short one Marisol and the tattoo girl I think her name is gabby.."}
{"text":"The wife and I love this spot. Nice location, great food and friendly service. Everything we've tried so far, we've really enjoyed. And we always top it off with two Acai Smoothies.
If you're in the area, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Rachel her self apologized and sent a gift card for the troubles of my last order at the store , that was EXTREMLY sweet and really made me change my mind on the restaurant ! I will defiantly be a return costumer and have other eat there as well ! Thank you"}
{"text":"This small kitchen has some great food from amazingly good burgers to healthy stuff like fruit bowls and salads. They serve a good breakfast and lunch yet I haven't tried the dinner yet. Try them out, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Very clean, delicious, and fresh. The best part was probably the friendly staff though. Thank you Justin for welcoming us in and recommending some great options. Looking forward to eating here again soon."}
{"text":"This place was awful. My boyfriend ordered a burger that was the saltiest thing either of us had ever tasted, and extremely unseasoned. I ordered a chicken wrap that had more cucumber slices and other random ingredients rather than actual chicken. 
When I asked about the ingredients of the wrap, the staff told me that it was simply pre made and they really had no idea what it consisted of. 
Needless to say I was disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"Hello All, 
Rachel's Kitchen has a little bit of everything you could ask for. It's pretty straight forward and a healthier choice to start or end to your day. 
They do take a little longer then usual depending on if they are busy or not. But we have been here many times and have had no complaints!! 
Always leave happy and full!

RIGHT: Veggie Sandwich made into a Wrap w/ Fries
MIDDLE: Oatmeal Cookies"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  We went there for breakfast; maybe lunch is better.  The nice things about the restaurant is the outdoor seating.  Very lovely.  And Peet's coffee.  Delish, as was the salsa.

We've heard good things so we were anxious.  They tout themselves as wholesome, so when breakfast came we were let down.  Immediately we noticed the potatoes.  Not at all wholesome -- right from Smart/Final, maybe Ore-Ida.  I expected freshly made there.  We both ordered omelettes.  Again disappointing.  Overcooked, with the cheese on the outside.  This doesn't allow the two sides to melt together.  

We might give it another chance for lunch.  But for a $28 breakfast, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I called ahead for a pick up order here and was very pleased with the service and quality of food. My order was also ready right when I got there and that made for efficiency while being in a hurry.

I ordered the chicken and roasted vegetable salad and the portion I received was incredibly generous. It was full of roasted zucchini, squash, eggplant, fresh tomato, cucumber and marinated grilled chicken. I didn't even have to ask for the dressing on the side because it was already there and it was a nice portion of the vinaigrette, not one of those baby cups you sometimes receive and have to ask extra for. 

I like this place because the food is always fresh and the portions are always generous. My personal favorites are the Cobb salad, the 440 sandwich, any of their delicious soups and the lemon bars. Their breakfast menu is also full of good eats.

Ordering for pick up or dine in this place is my go to for fresh food in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Was here yesterday and the service was beyond slow... my food order was wrong.... TWICE! The girl that took my order was nice, but that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this place. The food was.... forgettable...  I would've been better off going to McDonalds and saving myself a couple bucks. The service and the food is just not worth it."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday afternoon with some coworkers.  Four us ordered separately but right after one another.  One person got their food almost immediately upon sitting down but was halfway done with the second person received their ordered.  By the time the third person received their order I got up to check on mine as I was still waiting.  It should be noted that I ordered the same menu item as the second person to receive their order.  As I got to the counter to check mine came out FINALLY!  A fifth person joined us late into the lunch but ordered while I was still waiting for my item.  There's came out shortly after mine.  It makes zero sense! 

Ironically, this visit was almost three years to the date of my last visit and the experience was almost identical minus the fact that they were no where near crowded, there were no lines, and plenty of seating.  I like Rachel's food but if you want to eat as a group this is not a place I would risk going to for lunch.  Even though we ordered separately, we were all in line together, and at the time our group was the only ones placing orders.  Maybe this spot is a win for takeout but I won't be returning for takeout or otherwise unless this is a coworker choice, in which case I will probably decline the offer."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great compliment to the Henderson, NV Hilton Garden Inn.  We stopped into Rachel's after a night's stay at the Hilton to try the Served Anytime Breakfast.  Great greeting, friendly and efficient staff, Liz, the manager, stopped by our table a couple of times to check our satisfaction.  The food was excellent.  We had the Breakfast Burrito and the Protein Scramble.  Beautiful presentation and taste, and remember, this is not a full service restaurant.  A real asset to Henderson and to Hilton."}
{"text":"Their chicken caesar wraps are amazing. Rachel's has a lot of good healthy choices for lunch. Don't forget to try their sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Just waited 30 minutes for my HERE order. I was the only one in here when I ordered. Then they brought everything to go out to my family of 5. I sent my salad back to be mixed and put in a bowl. Part of the here experience. Super annoyed since I tipped well! No apology on long wait or serving everything to go."}
{"text":"It was nice to hear that Rachel's Kitchen opened on my side of town. I passed it by a few times as I didn't realize it was part of the Hilton, should have read some Yelp reviews first, my bad.
Their wraps and sandwiches are good and I enjoy splitting them for lunch with a friend so I can have a smoothie.
There are seats located inside, a separate part of the hotel, just off of the lobby or they have an outdoor patio area with umbrellas for shade. They offer a free dessert with a yelp check in as well."}
{"text":"We finally got to try Rachel's Kitchen one afternoon, and we were quite pleased with our first visit.

We shared a BBQ Chicken Wrap, Protein Scramble and an Islander Smoothie. The portions were pretty good size, and the sweet potato fries that came with the wrap were done to perfection. Quality ingredients, no shortcuts here.

The smoothie was very refreshing and naturally sweet...a perfect complement to our lunch. The service was awesome, and workers were very helpful with any questions we had.

Definitely returning to try other items from their MASSIVE menu!   ALOHA!!!

YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(72/100) \"That's A Wrap!\""}
{"text":"After trying Rachel's in Summerlin, I'm so happy we now have one in our hood!
Today was opening day, and we met up with neighbors Christina W. and Arvin C. for a little Din-din.

The Menu is exactly the same as all of the other locations, and last time I tried their BBQ Chicken Wrap and Hawaiian Bliss Smoothie. This time, I went with their Sautéed Mushroom Cheeseburger and an Incredible Hulk Smoothie. I don't know about you, but I like my meats pink and perfectly medium rare. Unfortunately, all burgers here are cooked Medium to Cardboard...You have been warned

The burger was okay, but Wifey's 440 Sandwich was very tasty. I will be back, not for a burger, but for other menu items. Welcome to the neighborhood Rachel's Kitchen!   ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"This is second time I've been here. I'm always looking for a place that serves healthy juices, salads and other varieties that are essential whole foods. This place has great selection and my favorite is their green juice. Staff friendly and very convenient location."}
{"text":"This place got great reviews on YELP, so i figured i had to try it. I ordered the BBQ chicken wrap and sweet potato fries. The wrap was tasty and the sweet potato fries  were crispy and not mushy like other places. The front of the store is all glass so you have a nice view of everything that is going on outside of the store. You can chill-out and watch all of the people walking their dogs, or watch all of the people jogging by. Its a nice setup. I would have given them 5 stars but the employees just seemed a bit disconnected. Maybe its because they were busy or because it was early when we ate their."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and made quickly. There are lots of healthy options on the menu and they serve breakfast all day! I ordered online and picked up and everything went very smoothly. 
There is a nice-looking covered patio outside that I would love to try out sometime soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered bacon cheeseburgers. The bacon wasn't drained or blotted. The  burgers were cooked unevenly liked they were nuked and kinda rubbery. Disgustingly greasy. Probably could have got a better burger across the street from the Heart Attic Grill. And the fries were cold. I hate cold fries. The service, however, was excellent!"}
{"text":"Rachel's kitchen is a quick fix for a healthy meal. 

I typically love their big breakfast with toast, eggs, potatoes, and switch out the bacon with turkey bacon. 

I also love that they have Acai bowls! 

This location is big, but the flow is decent. Meaning that even when it's busy I didn't have to wait a long time to get the food. It's also easily accessible by an easy exit on the summerlin parkway. 

I heard that they have unlimited mimosas too, but I have not had a chance to try. Next time!"}
{"text":"As much as I loved the food , the service was just so awful that I have to rate this 2 stars. The food was absolutely amazing :) I came here with a friend on 6/17/14 at 2 o'clock. We ordered our food and the two people up front just looked so miserable and unhappy. They acted like they were so busy too. There were very few people in the restaurant.  My friend and I both got wraps. Hers came out really quick. One of the girls then asked if everything was fine and we noted that I just needed my food. She then came back out with a salad. The salad was for somebody else. After waiting another 15 minutes , my food finally came out. I literally waited 28 minutes for a wrap while my friend had hers out in less than 10. I then asked for a side of ranch and that took another 5 minutes.  I was so frustrated and hungry that I actually went up to the kitchen and had to ask for the ranch. It's like they forgot about my order completely ! They didn't apologize once for their mistakes. The food was great, I was extremely pleased. Hopefully,  they work on their service some more however."}
{"text":"this location is so convenient and close to my home! I came here for a great Saturday morning breakfast. I ordered a mimosa and veggie burger. I accidentally spilled my mimosa and the worker was on it right away. he also brought out a new one which was extremely nice. The food is held to the same standard. I will always keep coming back."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, tasty healthy food. I've been regular here for several years as they have good food and are close. I like their lunch options, smoothies, and pastries best (oh and the always fresh and sweet fruit selection vs some places where fruit is either tart or over ripe)...all items I've had are flavorful, have fresh ingredients and I love the healthy options. I like several breakfast items as well, however 4 star is due to bit more seasoning needed on some breakfast items and some pasta items (my husband concurs). Staff have always been courteous, kind, warm smiles, and attentive. I've brought both in town and out of town guests to visit and they've loved items they've ordered here as well. I'll continue to visit."}
{"text":"\"Oh you wanted that to go?\" \"No I wanted to eat here but that was forty minutes ago when I ordered it. Now I have to go back to work before I'm late.\" \"No its cool. I can wait another five minutes for you to box it up.\" Update: I ordered a burger. Got a chicken sandwich. Fail."}
{"text":"Love this place. They make the best food ever. Costumer service is always fantastic. Love how it's just down the street from my house."}
{"text":"It's a really good place to have outdoor brunch this time of year (end of autumn). The atmosphere is great at a shaded table under lots trees with green scenery. The vegetarian sandwich I ordered today is pretty good. I really like they put raw onion, grilled eggplant, grilled tomato with little mayo sauce in it. Watermelon juice tastes really fresh and yummy. However, I don't really like the arugula pear salad I ordered today. It was a tad too sour and under seasoned (just need a dash of salt) to me. As a big fan of arugula salads, I didn't finish them today. It's a 3.5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"No chicken salad, instead of contacting me they filled half my order and charged my card through Grub hub, so I got food for 1 instead of food for 2, thanks guys that totally sucks.  If you don't have the entire order you should stop and not just fill what you feel like.

Chicken salad is a major item on the menu, and they don't have that many items on the menu, how do you run a business when you can't even provide the few things you indicate that you have?

The chicken tortilla soup had almost no chicken and the wrap that I did get was dry with little or no Cesar dressing.

This is the 2nd time I have had problems with this restaurant, clearly 2 for 2 is telling me something.  The restaurant can't deliver food or what you get isn't edible.

Update: the restaurant made amends and refunded my money, that's what you call treating you customers right, thank you."}
{"text":"This place definitely has awesome food. Everything tastes so fresh and they have decent portion sizes as well.

I had a fresh juice, Sweet Greens, and it was pretty delicious! I also had the turkey avocado sandwich which was amazing! My fiancé had the turkey wrap, my dad the chicken curry sandwich and my mom the chicken salad sandwich. Everyone loved their food and I can see us returning in the future! It was a great place to have lunch!

The only downside is that they don't have their drinks on the menu except for the wines and beers. We ended up getting bottled water because it was in the case and didn't think they had anything else to drink and didn't bother asking since it wasn't on the menu. Turns out they have teas and I believe lemonade and coffee. It would have been helpful if they put all of their offerings on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! They're good is always so tasty and the place is always clean. I go here for lunch on my break and they always make the food quickly and their ingredients are always fresh!! Staff is friendly and welcoming. The only downside I see it's parking since u have to pay $3 if u want to park close to the restaurant; however they'll give u a $2 discount from your order if u present them with the parking receipt."}
{"text":"We love Rachel's!!! Quality food for people that care about their health. Gluten free menu is plentiful with options. They have gluten free pastas. Fresh juices made to order. When we are in Vegas this is a must for us!!! Give them a try."}
{"text":"If you are looking for quality, healthy food in Vegas, this is the place.  The turkey sandwich tasted really fresh and delicious.  The sweet potato fries were so good that even my husband liked them (and he usually hates sweet potatoes).  And the smoothies were fresh made, sweet, and totally hit the spot.

The price was kind of high ($18 for the sandwich, fries, and one smoothie), but the ingredients did taste top notch, and the sandwich was big enough for two people to share.  I wish there was a Rachel's near my house!"}
{"text":"I love their food, but never use the online ordering! You have to wait a while for your food anyway because they don't look at the orders. I placed an order a hour before I needed to pick it up while we were waiting at centennial hospital and when I went to get it they hadn't even started it yet. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is always a favorite of mine, been eating here since they opened. Lately they've gotten very stingy on their French fries. But have awesome gluten free bread. Also, don't come here at sunset don't have blinds, so you'll be blinded by the sun! Get blinds for you doors!!"}
{"text":"I luv chicken salad from here. Usually split it with my daughter."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a new restaurant near my house, however this place was a huge regret. We were expecting healthy home made foods, what we got was a grilled cheese that was microwaved on ciabatta bread, onion rings and fries that are exactly like store bought frozen brands, an overpriced smoothie and a bland turkey sandwich that tasted like one you cold buy at a supermarket deli or gas station. The restaurant itself is small, uncomfortable with glass mosaic top tables that should be outdoors only!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Everything is priced reasonably and the juices are excellent. Staff is friendly and prompt. Haven't had anything bad here."}
{"text":"Hubby got the Asian Chicken Salad, which tasted pretty good. The dressing was light but had good flavor. Salad was romaine lettuce and good amount of chicken breast included. 

H had the kid's Mac & Cheese plain. A good amount and tasted good. Not your out of the box recipe. :)

O had the chicken tenders, which were very salty. They didn't look freshly made and they tasted dry. :(

Best thing I think was my fresh squeezed Sweet Greens juice--reminded me of my Mean Green juice recipe. It was SO good, it's been a month or so since I had fresh squeezed juice!  I added more ice and it was delicious!  I should've ordered a large. ;)"}
{"text":"Tacone left without a goodbye, and took its sauce bar and Kingston wrap with it. But when Rachel's Kitchen moved in, spiffed up the place with new seat cushions, cute tables and, most importantly, a wine menu, I had high expectations for a more sophisticated dining experience, food included.The service and atmosphere are outstanding.The staff could not be nicer.I'm a wee bit disappointed because the food's just okay. 

The most memorable part of my \"440\" chicken sandwich ($10.50) was the size of the red pepper. I believe they cut a pepper in half, roasted it, and laid it over the chicken. It was an unbelievable amount of red pepper. Other than the pepper, the chicken, goat cheese and avocado sandwich wasn't dressed up. It tasted like something I would make at home. Sometimes when I eat out, the food tastes better, as if there's a thin layer of honey butter spread all over everything.  

My husband ordered the chicken curry wrap and we exchanged halves. His wrap wasn't any better than my 440. 

The ingredients are fresh, the wine is okay, and the outdoor seating is lovely. I kind of wish they would have spiffed up the menu in the same way they spiffed up the decor."}
{"text":"Wow!  I just had an awesome breakfast and I am ready for the rest of my day!

I decided to try \"The Favorite\" breakfast plate because it had avocado, goat cheese & sundried tomatoes (my 3 favorite things). 

A very friendly girl brought the plate out to me so I didn't have to wait by the counter. 

The food was fresh, hot, and tasted great!

I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"We took the family here after playing at the Container Park. We loved the variety of healthy vegetarian, vegan, gluten free and omivore options. They were super kid friendly with my little ones, and have a nice variety of coloring options while waiting for food. The kids meals are huge- my kids could have shared theirs.. that's not a complaint ;) Overall, I am looking forward to trying more menu items and will return again next time we take the kids to the park downtown."}
{"text":"This place is TOTALLY GOOD. Rachel's kitchen is similar to wild flower. The warps and sandwiches are amazing. I would totally suggest this place. Rachel's kitchen is also for people if you want to eat light. I would totally with no doubt come back and tell my friends to come."}
{"text":"I can always count on Rachel's kitchen for delicious fresh food.  Staff is very friendly and ambience is unique and relaxing.  They are a little pricy, but you're paying for restaurant quality food. Everything is fresh and there are many healthy options.  My favorite is the Pear Argula salad with tuna, it has crumbled goat cheese, pears,  even fennel. .. simply delicious!"}
{"text":"I come to Rachel's quite often - it's definitely a favorite of mine living up in the North Las Vegas Area. They make great juices, sandwiches and wraps. I mostly order their excellent salads however! My wife and I will be coming back repeatedly."}
{"text":"I ordered some spaghetti with a side of chicken and when it came out there was absolutely no chicken. So I told them about it and they brought it back to me pointing out the cheese and told me that is the chicken. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Maybe the breakfast is better, but dinner was not great. Wife ordered the Angel Hair Bolognese which was saturated in a so-so sauce. Caesar salad dressing was also just so-so. I had the bbq bacon burger cooked medium and got well done. Burger tasted like a Japanese burger to which they use a filler so it's more like meat loaf. Just not great and not worth $10.50. The sweet potato fries were good and the Berry Mania smoothie was also good, so maybe we try it for breakfast , but we won't be doing dinner again any time soon."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for a quick lunch. The service was fast, which is something I highly appreciate. I ordered the Albacore Tuna Salad Sandwich, it was good! The portions was big and the taste was pretty good. I had a side of fruit with my sandwich which is a great way to end my meal. I'd come back to try their other sandwiches. The restaurant was clean and not very big. The only feed back I have is I feel that the tables and seats are too close to each other, so you're kind of like elbow to elbow with others."}
{"text":"I usually try to visit Rachel's kitchen once a month. The food is a bit expensive but very good!! Love the smoothies! The customer service is always friendly and greeted with a hello. Thank you and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went in today to try their açaí bowls and I was so disappointed. It was mostly granola and raisins so you couldn't even taste the açaí itself. Plus, it was such a small portion! Save yourself $7 and try an açaí bowl from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious food...a wonderful place to enjoy a healthy meal on the go, or eating in."}
{"text":"Everybody loves this place, but I just don't!  I'm sorry!  I hate it when everybody loves a place, but I just can't get into the hype.  Rachel's Kitchen is ok, but it would never be my first choice of places to eat.

Everytime I come here, I always think, \"Damn, this place is really expensive for what it is.\"

And then everytime I look at the menu and think, \"Ohhh, this sounds really good.  I'm going to like this.\"  

And then everytime I order I think, \"Damn, this place takes a really long time to make a freaking sandwich.\"

And then everytime I eat it, I think, \"Ahh man, this isn't that special.\"

And everytime I leave feeling mildly annoyed that I spent money here."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is clean, stylish, and pleasant. I went here with some friends before we watched a show at the Smithsonian center. I would come back again, but only when it isn't out of my way."}
{"text":"When we want a tasty healthier option when we eat out, we head to Rachel's Kitchen. Post workout protein packed drinks, meet and greet with friends over breakfast, fast call ahead lunches, quick dinners after a long day..  Rachel's has it all. Delicious food,  friendly service, and healthy options!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat, great food, great environment but.... Not enough seating outdoors. People bring their dogs, which is cool, but if you have an aggressive dog, you should not take them into a social setting.  If you can put up with the above a definite place to go and eat and relax for a  moment."}
{"text":"Great feel good cafe food style restaurant!!! The wife usually gets one of the wraps, and they are amazing. She is particular to the chicken Caesar wrap w sweet potato fries. We get the grilled cheese for the kid, and it comes with a big bowl of fruit. I am particular to the burgers and the wraps myself. They also offer great smoothies and they have fresh daily baked goods. I wish we found out about this place sooner, as it has become our go-to place when we are indecisive for meals."}
{"text":"Pretty good organic food! I didn't like the juiced drink I got, probably cuz it tasted so fresh! Didn't give 5 stars because the service was slow and the cook looked pre-occupied staring at women."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I've gotten the fettuccine alfredo and the 440 sandwich and both are fantastic. The only turn off is how long they take to make anything. You have to call in and order if you want to avoid waiting 30+ minutes. I've waited 35 minutes for a sandwich before which is simply not worth it, no matter how good it tastes. Definitely call ahead and order."}
{"text":"Update: we just waited almost 55 minutes for a salad and pasta. Really? I called the order in ahead since I know they take forever. Called in at 12:18 and told them I'd be there in 20 mins. Got there after 25 mins and no food. Waited until 1:05 to go to the front and ask where my food was. The front girl was embarrassed and got us our food ASAP and gave us a free cookie (looked awesome but was rock hard). All in all, Rachel's just isn't worth the hassle or the expense- a salad, pasta, and 2 soft drinks was $28+. ...and almost an hour wait (got the food at 1:11). I just don't think I'll go back anymore."}
{"text":"Things To Try:
- Arugula Pear Salad: Baby arugula, pears, fennel, goat cheese and pecans tossed with a lemon herb vinaigrette
- Sweet Greens Juice: fresh pressed kale, spinach, cucumber, celery, apple, lemon and ginger root
- Hawaiian Bliss Smoothie: Pineapples, bananas, coconut, pineapple juice and nonfat vanilla frozen yogurt
- Fresh Watermelon Juice 

Would I suggest that others go out of their way to try RK? not necessarily. However, if you live or work in the area, I would pop in. Their ingredients are fresh and I enjoy their fresh pressed juice and salads"}
{"text":"Quick brunch while waiting on car to be cleaned. Had a create your own omelette. I have to say this is the most over cooked omelet that I have ever had. The flavor is quite bland and omelette is lacking ingredients. Served With sour cream on top of the omelette. Should be on the side . Anyway I will not be back and do not recommend this place at all. IHOP would have been better so that is not saying much about this place."}
{"text":"We stopped in at Rachel's to grab a bit of breakfast while in Vegas. We tried the French Toast and an omelette. Both were very tasty. The French Toast was unique in that it was served on a sliced roll."}
{"text":"This Rachael's Kitchen is attached to the Hilton Garden Inn and is a community staple. I often come to this location for fast casual breakfast or lunch. The atmosphere is lively and the wait staff is courteous. During I recent visit I returned my French Toast because it was undercooked and soggy although the staff quickly responded and remade the dish. Overall my experience at Rachael's is consistently decent."}
{"text":"Finally!  I have been waiting for Rachel's to open in Downtown Las Vegas.  I was there are their first day and the food and service were awesome, especially since it was day one.  I had the opportunity to talk to the franchisees and they were so friendly.  They were the type of people you want to see do well.  I will be back often for the Signature Pasta or whatever I am craving. I highly recommend you try it out."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwiches are good. The parfaits are better. One size coffee. A little pricey."}
{"text":"Best healthy breakfast/lunch spot in Vegas! For very reasonable prices, Rachel's offers a wide variety of healthy food. I tried their PB smoothie, the fruity berry smoothie, the granola, Acai bowl, and chicken Caesar salad (over multiple trips). All delicious and satisfying. I highly recommend this place. They even deliver M-F (but unfortunately not on Saturdays)."}
{"text":"Ordered a peachberry smoothie tastes pretty good but at $6.50, it's overpriced. Might as well get a large pomegranate smoothie from McDonalds for under $4, which tastes the same. Got to mention though,  that I had a Popeye's secret fresh squeezed juice last week,  which was very good. Would come back for another visit."}
{"text":"Rachel's is a great place to go for a brunch  or a chill meal with no higher aspirations than making fairly simple, but delish food.  Most of the food is on the healthier side, btw. I \'ve been here a half a dozen times and always came away satisfied with my meal and the chance to sit outside on the patio.  There's pretty much always a stream of customers."}
{"text":"The breakfast was good but not quite great. The chocolate chip banana pancakes were terrific. French toast was good but the eggs and bacon didn't measure up. Bacon was way over cooked. The kind that disintegrates when you pick it up.
I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Black Coffee is really good here. I think prices seem a little expensive. I just had a cookie and called it a day."}
{"text":"Disgusting. My boyfriend and I waited almost 30 minutes for 2 smoothies and his tasted like a flinstone vitamin. It was also extremely liquidy, like juice. Don't come here, they have gone waaay downhill."}
{"text":"Fettuccini was soooo good.   Chicken in the Cesar was overly dry.  Love the guitarist on Friday night. Good variety in a casual setting."}
{"text":"Ever since I discovered this place I just cant get enough! I love that their food is healthy and simple and i love the fact that they have Turkey products, because I no longer eat Red Meat....my favorite things to order are their breakfast wraps, Turkey Burger and their Tropical Bliss Smoothie it is soo delicious!!! Server/ Casheir, Yaya is amazing! She is so sweet and kind and always has great suggestions when I'm being indecisive about what to order, her infectious smile and positive attitude really makes having breakfast there special....great job Rachel's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"The food was not good at all!

Came here for lunch one day and was extremely disappointed with the food. We ordered the curry chicken salad and the eggs scrambled for lunch/brunch. The Curry chicken salad was drowning and drenched in this thick sugary dressing that I couldn't even swallow the food, totally disgusting. The egg scrambles was mediocre at best and the bread was not very fresh, and most certainly came from low end grocery store. 

Service was very nice, and the bathrooms were clean, but I would never come back for the food!"}
{"text":"I always seen this place when I went to 24 hour fitness next door so I decided to stop in & see what they had. I ordered a sweet greens juice it was really good! Especially to have sooo many greens in it, they balanced the taste perfectly! The mood was peaceful when I came in (around 9am), very clean & spacious. The employees could've been a little friendlier but I guess that's what you can expect at 9am lol? Anywho overall I was really happy with the experience & will be returning. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars would have to be the prices they should definitely come down a little, other then that it was great!"}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is one of the best places to eat breakfast, lunch or dinner. They have great selections for food and even blended juices like watermelon juice. The staff is always friendly and courteous and they have plenty seating inside and out.

The location is great. The District is a great place to hang out and relax, do some window shopping, and chill with the kids at the water splash area.

Anytime we have family in town we always make sure to take them to Rachel's Kitchen!

FYI: They have a reward program so download their app and start earning points to work towards a free entree!"}
{"text":"Not my first time, but this review will be from my most recent visit. 

I got their chicken chopped broccoli salad which was just divine.  Amazing. The sauce is just so addicting. Loved it so much that I might just order it again the next time I'm there as well.

I also got the sweet potato fries, which were good but not great. They weren't very crispy and were a bit limp...

There's a good selection of healthy drink options for you to choose from. It was very hard for me to decide between a smoothie or a juice but I ended up ordering the skin cleanser juice, which was delicious and refreshing. Friend ordered the watermelon juice which I'll probably come back for...tomorrow lol...

The portions are a good size. I was very full and satisfied after my meal. 


Rachel's kitchen is great for healthy fresh delicious meals.
I recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"Wanted to love Rachel's. Cute decor & clean, but unfortunately for me, that is where it ended. I asked if the chicken curry wrap was sweet and was told it wasn't equal balance of sweet and salty. However, when I received it, it was incredibly sweet. I tried to pick out the chicken, but there were more raisins than chicken. 

The barbecue chicken wrap was very dry, with no barbecue sauce either in it or on the side. French fries also missed the mark and were undercooked. They reminded me of fast food fries that had been sitting around for a while. 

Cute, clean place with friendly staff, but the food was very disappointing."}
{"text":"The only reason I give it 2 stars is because my partner likes the smoothies and it has a lot of healthy options. I do think the prices are a bit high but I guess that's what you pay for healthy items. The most upsetting part was the \"acai bowl\". It had a ton of granola and only a bit of acai mix. It was more of a granola bowl with acai topping. It was really warm which made it taste weird. I was really disappointed and hungry once I left."}
{"text":"When you name your dish Signature Pasta. You better stick your foot in it! Rachaels is a cute, clean, and quaint establishment that boasts healthier foods.. Yes they have some green juices and salads but my dish with all its melty cheeses and loads of pasta.. Not so healthy.. I will say it was fresh tasting and loaded w garlic. It needed that certain je ne sais quois.. Wait yes i do... SALT! With it being a signature dish it shouldnt need anything! For that reason it gets a 3..."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying Rachel's and I'm so glad I did!

I met Ms. Fake-Up herself, Dana S, for a spur of the moment lunch and jaunt around The District. I had a hard time finding her in the restaurant because I'm not used to seeing her without all that fake-up lols. I was hungry but also trying to just be a healthier person (don't tell that to the peanut butter cookies I just snarfed) so I got a curried chicken salad over top a green salad. The green salad part kind of ruined it--personal preference...I just don't like vinaigrette and I didn't realize it had vinaigrette on it. No matter, though, because the chicken salad was good and next time, I'll get just the chicken salad with a sandwich instead.

Also got the watermelon juice. Yes, it was tasty. Yes, I can understand that it's winter and the prices have to pay for more than just the juice. But over $4 for this juice was really pricey. I will skip it next time to just save a little change. 

As for the other aspects of business--service, excellent. Decor, excellent. Dining al Fresco? Gotta get on that before it gets to be like stepping into the seventh circle of Hell outside. 

Skip Panera and come here. Actually go to Panera just for the cookies after lunch. 

No Danas were harmed in the creation of this Yelp review."}
{"text":"With a yelp check in you get a free glass of wine with and entree! Red wine goes great with the pasta dish! Ordered the traditional tomato  basil  which is my favorite!
Weekdays are fun and more casual because it is not as crowded as the weekends.
Being in the District, and the cool spring weather lot of doggies are around. Outside dining is an option if you would like to bring your fur baby."}
{"text":"We've been frequenting Rachel's Kitchen for quite some time now--even before the expansion & remodel . We mainly go there for breakfast at least a couple times a month on Saturdays and it's always enjoyable.  The kitchen staff knows our order and that I often substitute Gruyere cheese for the Swiss in my breakfast wrap as well as opting for fruit instead of home fries.  I also love their bacon Gruyere muffins- they are so delicious! The owner often stops by and chats with us and everyone makes us feel so welcome. It's really a great place to relax and enjoy a meal--you can sit inside or outside and people watch while sipping a smoothie, indulging in some muffins or their yummy variety comfort foods."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!  Great spot for one of those days where you are looking for a quick bite rather than going to a fast food restaurant.  

There were many options on the menu, but I decided to go for the Turkey club.  I mean cmon now, turkey, bacon, AND avocados all in a sandwich, I am sold! 

The portion size was decent!  Not too big and not too small!  It came with either salad or fries (I chose the more unhealthier option).  If im going to have bacon, might as well throw in the fries right?! haha.  

I'd definitely go back and try other things!  The smoothies looked good, maybe that next time!"}
{"text":"Love the location! Happy to have Rachel's closer to the strip. Happy hour 4-6 PM with 1/2 off beer, wine, and champagne mimosas!! What!! Hello downtown!! Also on Thursdays from 4-7 PM they have live music-wasssuPp!! Rachel in da house!! Food lovers! Healthy good lovers! Music lovers! Good ambiance lovers! Come here!! Ok that's all! Xoxo"}
{"text":"Always consistent... Loving the banana chocolate chip pancakes, amazing! My son loves them, great portions, and good quality! Love the fact that they have healthy options on the menu as well as a juice menu. Everyone is always kind at this place, very welcoming, and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Not the best RK location I've been to. The food took a while the last couple of times I went and it wasn't very busy. I also got charged for a water cup...I have never been charged for a water cup at ANY other restaurant. Next time I'll just run the water into my hands if they try to charge me again! This would have been 3 stars but the water cup issue lowered my rating."}
{"text":"Really good food and smoothies!! Friendly staff and cosy place! A recommendation when you want a healthy breakfast or brunch and staying at Fremont Street!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great and the service is just as good! Come here for lunch with girlfriends often! They also have a really great kids menu that my son loves!"}
{"text":"Rachel's kitchen has a wide variety of healthy food.  I work close and love to get lunch here.  The service is fantastic!  An order was mistaken and they kindly fixed the problem with no hassle.  They have a wide variety of options for everyone from meat eaters to vegans!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good, this place feels wholesome, healthy and classy.. maybe the name, location, people that frequent the place, decor and ambiance (can't put my finger on it). Probably a combination of all of them. Food is consistently tastey, staff is friendly and smiley :) and it's clean/comfy. 

One down side is it is slightly higher in price for walk in ordering, another downside are the windows, so bright in the morning and hurts my (sensitive) eyes."}
{"text":"Mimosas in the morning... what a great way to start off the day!  There's so many great items to choose from at this place.  To complement my mimosa I went with The Favorite which has eggs scrambled with basil, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, and topped with avocados and goat cheese. I figured why not go with an entree called The Favorite to go with my favorite drink :-)."}
{"text":"Love that they serve breakfast all day and serve fresh juice. Food is always so tasty and fresh. Love eating on the patio."}
{"text":"I went there with my girlfriend as I wanted to try something new and she had liked this place from before. I have to say, I was a disappointed, in the price and the food. The place was also a little cramped. 

I must admit the portion was huge and the greens were fresh. I had a goat cheese salad with grilled chicken on top. The chicken was ok and the dressing was a bit watery and under seasoned as well as well. I added some salt and it tasted better.

Did you know salad started from the romans who called it herba salta, meaning salted vegetables?

That's right, season your salads ;)

All in all I can see the place doing well, but I don't see me in any rush to try it again."}
{"text":"Third time is a charm!! We ordered gluten free mac & cheese & gluten free fettuccine both with chicken. When they came out the server asked if we have a gluten allery.... because both dishes have flower in the sauce. Mind you we confirmed that it was gluten free when we ordered.  They had to take back the meal and make us new dishes. 15 minutes later the 2nd dish came out and it was the wrong order. They had refunded us a couple dollars for the change in order initially and this time had asked if we want the dish remade.  At this point we have been waiting 45 minutes to get our lunch. .. so the answer was no thank you.  They refunded us for the pasta dishes. At least the watermelon juice was on point. Rachel's,  you let me down..."}
{"text":"I placed an order through Grub Hub. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich with sweet potato fries 

I liked the chicken salad. It was on sourdough bread, which I requested, but it was toasted. I didn't see anywhere on the menu where this was mentioned. I would have preferred to have the bread untoasted. 

The sweet potato fries were over cooked and cold. I understand it was a delivery order but maybe they should use different packaging. There weren't many fries in the box."}
{"text":"Love it - but it is too expensive ! Ends up @ $20 per person for a salad or pasta you pick up yourself at a counter .. Lower your prices"}
{"text":"Seeing Rachel's Kitchen near my gate was amazing. Ordered my usual huge Sunrise smoothie for $8 (they actually use real fruit)
Food items are prepackaged."}
{"text":"If you've had plastic surgery, idolize The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, and think your crap doesn't stink, then this place is perfect for you to congregate at!

***

Last month, my boyfriend and I came here with my mom, who recommended the place because of the convenient location and great menu selections. I was pretty excited to try this place out . The dining area was small but clean with a counter in the back to order at. The menu hoisted above the counter showcased alot of tasty sounding menu items and it was almost hard to decide on one thing. Nearly all the tables were taken and it was obvious that Rachel's Kitchen was a popular lunch spot. I ordered the Ultimate Grilled Cheese with a side salad, my mom ordered the Mac N Cheese and my boyfriend had a fish wrap. 

Everything sounds good so far, right? The entire time we were there, we kept getting the condescending elevator eyes with the snobby sneer from many of the other diners.. you know that stuck up look that snobby people give like they smelled something bad? There was one guy in the back corner table, with the spray on tan and tank top on showing what little of his youth he was trying to hold on to, that had a staring problem. Every time I looked up in his direction, he was looking at us. The women who took the table near us, with their obvious augmentation job and their haggard aging Barbie doll appearance, kept looking toward my mom and whispering. We weren't loud, or dressed inappropriate, but I think the sheer fact that my mom is plus size, that we weren't sporting the high end fashion and that maybe my boyfriend and I are an interracial couple had something to do with all the various stares. The pretentiousness and overall douche-baggery vibe that saturated the dining area made my dining experience uncomfortable. 

It's a shame that the clientele that day was bad because the food was really good and reasonably priced. Despite the delicious lunch that my party and I had, the unwelcome feeling by the other diners ruined any chances of me returning again."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with my boyfriend. Ordered the turkey club with fries and protein scramble. Sandwich was really good but the fries were cold and undercooked. I got full off the sandwich alone so I didn't care to have my fries replaced.

My boyfriend really enjoyed his protein scramble. Tropical iced tea was really good! 

Good food options and nice atmosphere whether you eat inside or outside. 

Would like to come back and try the banana chocolate chip pancakes and a smoothie. 

Friendly and quick service provided by the workers."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Went for breakfast and loved the breakfast burrito- with avocado!-, the lemon poppyseed muffin, coffee and juice! Everything was fresh and yummy. The decor is cute and there's outdoor seating with a view of some red rock. All around very nice!!"}
{"text":"The Arugula Pear salad is to die for!! Absolutely love this place and the chill atmosphere"}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side but worth eating here once in a while for a quick lunch date. Food takes a little longer but tastes delicious. Deff give it a try. Won't regret it :) 

And ask for their rewards card


For management: give out more fries at least"}
{"text":"I'll start off with my positive experiences and then my negative. 

I work downtown, so I often order food (to go) from Rachel's kitchen for lunch. The food here is delicious, I love everything on their menu. You can tell that everything is fresh. A little more pricey than other places, but you definitely pay for the quality of the food and it's worth it. The people that work
here are incredibly nice and polite. 

I'm giving two stars because half the time when I order to go, there's something wrong with my order. Either they forget to pack some of the food, or they totally give me a sandwich I didn't order. Sometimes my food is not made the way I wanted it to be made. It's just really annoying because it always happens. Sometimes I don't bother saying anything and sometimes I make them correct the order. Whoever is packing the food to go needs to pay more attention because the number of times all of this has happened to me is ridiculous."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE this location!  We use them often for catering for our corporate events and the manager is super accommodating and goes out of his way to make the events a success.  I definitely can count on this Rachel's to come through in a crunch.  And the food is a definite crowd-pleaser. Attendees often request Rachel's Kitchen for our events.  The food is always delicious and its nutritious too!  I love the sweet potato fries and the smoothies! YUM! I also like the vibe at this location--pretty chill.  I brought a group of my friends here and now they are hooked too!"}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times due to me going straight from school to work and this is the only place to get food in the compound. This is a good restaurant with very nice and friendly workers. The establishment is very clean and it's very relaxing. 

I usually get their Hawaiin smoothie and it is absolutely to die for. The reason I give it a three star is because the service isn't the fastest, which is understandable since it is made fresh, BUT still very slow considering whenever I go it's not busy at all. 

Also, I find it a bit overpriced for okay food that is a smaller portion. So far I've had the burgers and the sandwiches and their alfredo pasta, but I feel like I can just make that at home for half the price and for a bigger portion.

It's whatever though, because I can get over that when I'm really hungry."}
{"text":"Used to be a Mexican place. I like it better now. Dined outside with the birds, had a great chicken Cesar salad. Friendly staff, despite all the ink. Order at the counter, they bring out your food, some of the quickest service. I do not care about a wait staff or not, I just care about the quality of the food, the promptness and the atmosphere. I like them on all the above"}
{"text":"My review of Rachel's Kitchen in the District is long over due.  I have enjoyed many a meal people watching at this location!  When the weather is nice, it is a fantastic casual place to dine al fresco.  They serve breakfast all day, which I love, and have beer & wine.  I was worried that when the District added parking on the interior road, it would make dining outside less enjoyable but I have not found that to be an issue or bother at all.

On this visit to Rachel's, we started by sharing the yogurt parfait, which comes with fresh berries and their delicious housemade granola.  This vanilla yogurt parfait has the perfect mix of salty and sweet with a great crunch.

Then I got the scrambled eggs w/ tomatoes & basil meal.  This comes with toast and breakfast potatoes.  The eggs were fluffy and the tomatoes & basil were fresh and light.  I ate a couple potatoes, which were good, but I was already full from the parfait!

The BF got the sautéed mushroom cheeseburger.  He said it was fantastic, but since I hate mushrooms and swiss, I will have to take his word for it."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4-5 times and no one ever told me about the rewards card.. The normal girl that rings me out isn't very friendly nor does she smile much which is a huge turn off in any customer service establishment.
However! What saved my opinion on this place was Dakota! Absolutely incredible guy awesome personality and signed me up for the loyalty program and was very apologetic that no one else mentioned it.
I'm a manager and honestly this is what I strive to have my employees be like.
Great food and smoothies plus it's a healthy place to eat which I enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow finally I have found a healthy and great tasting place to eat! I have been a fitness and figure competitor for more than 30 years. It has been hard to find healthy,tasty and convenient places to eat! I love the staff. The owner,j Vince  is fantastic and keeps the place clean and in order! I have never waited long in line either! try it!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"If you like your food prepared fresh and aren't into processed garbage that's served at other establishments across the valley, look no further than Rachel's Kitchen. The staff is tremendously courteous and the service is consistently good. Everyone from Debbie to Adriana have a customer first mentality and it's what brings me back every time, but yes, the food is the star of the show here. A vast selection of items are on the menu ranging from Breakfast Wraps (my favorite! Add basil, avocado, and mushrooms), to Burgers. The Turkey Club is exceptional, as well. The Smoothies are blended well (I recommend the Incredible Hulk with Whey). I've been coming here for over four years now and have never once been disappointed. Others have tried to imitate what Rachel's has perfected (ahem: Daily Kitchen...) and they don't even come close!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a cafe-like place, but the atmosphere was more like a fast-food. Place your order, pay, then put your # on the table & they serve it when it's ready. One of the few places I know of where you can get a very tasty grilled veg sandwich (I had mine on French bread). The sweet potato fries where also great. Service was good, but it wasn't very busy at about 3pm & it was weird that there were 4 girls at the counter standing in a circle chatting away for the whole time we were there. The guys seemed to be the only ones who had anything to do. The manager doesn't seem to be too good at scheduling staff."}
{"text":"A Very generous size for a smoothie, nice and thick. I ordered the acai Berry . It's sweet and a bit tart."}
{"text":"Much better breakfast than anywhere in Green Valley Ranch. This place is in the shops out the Backdoor of GVR by the cinemas. Love the omelettes. Lunch menu looks good too."}
{"text":"Meh...Their mantra is healthy food. It may be because the food taste so poorly your throw most of it away.  I had a tuna fish remade sandwich and I couldn't finish the first 1/2 of it. Airport prices for such poor food was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"I seriously never thought of using the word \"wholesome\" in regards to yelping about a place... but there really is no other word to describe the food here.

So... every time bf and I come to Vegas, we make it a point to come here.  Not only cause his sister works here, but the food here is just short of amazing.  We take the drive from SD at about 3am, and end up getting here just in time for breakfast.

I always order the oatmeal.  Not sure why, but this stuff here tastes like it was not only made with love, but it is different and wonderful and just plain WHOLESOME.  They give you a huge bowl of it; enough for two, but I finish it like theres no tomorrow.  

I also order their watermelon juice.  Made from real watermelons, and its none of that artificial coloring/juices crap anywhere else.  Their banana pancakes taste just like Jack Johnson said they would.  (Lame joke.)

Its a little ways off of the strip, but if you ever find yourself in the Green Valley area, come here.  Its in a small shopping center with Anthropologie and Francesca's, as well as a cute little patio for you to eat in."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good,  lots of tables for everyone.  Love the lighter choices menu with calories posted.  I opened for the Veggie burger,  it's served in whole wheat bread and a side garden salad with balsamic.  It was great and there was no dairy in this burger also! 

My hubby opted for the eggs, hash Browns,  two peices of toast.  The hash Browns here nice because they were not greasy.  

I also had to have one of their fresh juices,  it had kale,  celery,  beet etc and was a great. Size at the large.  This is a must order. 

Thus is a great place to go for a healthy fast food option.  Price is slightly higher then your tradition fast food but definitely worth the calories and eating organic.  

If you are into gluten free they also have great pasta options for you."}
{"text":"Delicious, clean, modern, eclectic, artsy.  

The Cob salad is now the best cob salad in town.  I thought Peppermill was the best, but it just got beat out!  The iced tea is also the best iced tea in Las Vegas, super refreshing, maxed out flavor.

I have one suggestion about the Turkey burgers: make them bigger.  While they taste great, full of flavor, they are just too small.  I'd need three of them to fill me up.  And offer some cheese please.

FYI: Parking at this location is difficult and you will most likely walk.  Also the location off of Las Vegas Blvd and the Odgen is extremely difficult to find parking."}
{"text":"I liked the food and the prices. The place is cute but  small. The menu had a great selection it was just hard to find a seat with all the traffic going thru there. It was really busy and there were 8 of us so besides that it was good."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast but I'm sure the rest of the menu is just as good. Items are healthy and ingredients are fresh.  A bit on the pricier side but you get what you paid for."}
{"text":"i went here because i was looking to try a new breakfast place. When i got there i was kind of taken back because to me the name sounded like a cute little diner place owned by a gal named Rachel... but i accept that was my assumption... i loved that they had fresh juice... it is a little expensive but what fresh juice isnt??! I ordered the breakfast with eggs, bacon, and toast... a stable at any breakfast place and they made it there along with a full menu.  When it came out the eggs were so well done I didn't even eat them.. i had to repeatedly ask for butter and jelly... and my sister ordered a club sand which and the fries were ice cold.  I'd maybe consider this place for like a juice and a quick wrap... or might even walk there ...if i lived close... but it's just not my type of place and quite expensive."}
{"text":"Personally I love this place .. I come in at least once a week. They're open early so it's not uncommon for me to be here at 730. It's nice and quiet .. I typically get the favorite which is an inlet with goat cheese mushrooms and sundried tomatoes. Makes me happy every time!! They also have fresh watermelon juice as part of their juices and let me tell you ... better than aqua Fresca any day !! Like I said I'm a loyal customer so I'll be back next week"}
{"text":"Is it possible to find a functional time machine and un-Grand Open this horrendously bad Rachel's Kitchen [RK]? Ray Kurzweil? Where are you, pal? 

What would Ray have to hypothesize on this one? Surely there would be better uses of the technology; however, this RK is so bad ....

Smoothies are the one item on the menu that will not be royally fucked. If you are getting anything other than a smoothie, you might be fucked ....

Badly wilted greens in a to-go salad. Check!
 
The poorest excuse for a sliver of whatever the feature ingredient in aforementioned salad was supposed to be. Check!

A thimble size amount of sweet potato fries. Check!

Sweet potato fries being as cold as Dick Cheney's heart? Check. Check. Check. 

I am not that happy with this RK. Frankly, it fucking sucks. 

Two-stars because I am nice."}
{"text":"I love the food here and love the atmosphere as well. This place is on the district and feels like a little community when you sit outside. I love how this place has healthy food and the food is so delicious. I love coming here and sitting outside with my boyfriend and enjoy the weather while we eat pasta or salads or whatever we will be getting that night. I truly love coming here and getting the food. I would 100 percent recommend this place to everyone to try. I love how they redid the district and now it feels like a little village."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Racheks Kitchen but was just poisoned by gluten. I knew I should have followed my instincts and left when the server had a hard time finding the gluten free menu. Celiac disease beware  it's a cross contamination free for all in here

Also dirty tables and servers with tons of time to chat but not wipe up

Will not be returning"}
{"text":"I've tried this place multiple times and I seriously don't know how it stays in business. 
There's is nothing special about their menu. I haven't tried a single thing off their menu that made me WOW.
It's clean and the service is good but the food is just ehhhh and totally not worth the money."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Good food & good service! I got the chicken salad on sourdough bread with fries! Super super yummy!"}
{"text":"The food is above average, but my favorite part was the outdoor area for eating. Great if you want a cafe feel with good food. Staff was very nice and professional."}
{"text":"I was in the area and heard about this lovely place from some friends. I decided to come in and try something for lunch at Rachel's Kitchen. To chalk it up, not a bad place at all. There's a variety for breakfast and lunch options, as well as smoothies and fresh juices. 
I was torn between the chicken salad sandwich and the grilled cheese, but opted for grilled cheese and my boyfriend got a turkey club sandwich (which was huge)! Our sandwiches were fine, but the price kinda stung at me a bit. I'd definitely come back here for the juices and smoothies though. I ordered just plain ol' carrot juice and I loved that it's made to order and it tasted so fresh."}
{"text":"I got a gift card from the manager after reading my post.  That's good customer relation right there and so I updated my post for that."}
{"text":"Their food just taste so amazing and it's so reasonably priced it's hard not to give them a 5-star. Service is generally good and I don't have anything to complain about this place!"}
{"text":"After hiking Sunday, several of us decided to meet up at this Rachel's Kitchen.  I had been at one of the locations several years ago, but this was my first time here.

I was going to get a fruit bowl until I saw the Special of the Day was their breakfast sandwich and I went with that and a coffee.  The sandwich consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, and avocado on ciabatta bread.  It comes with a generous portion of breakfast potatoes.

After ordering and getting my coffee cup, I went to a large table and put the order number holder down and then chose my coffee from different roasts available.  

In a short time, the sandwich arrived and it was quite tasty.  The potatoes were OK.  Having a choice of light or dark roast coffee is nice.

There's a Rachel's Kitchen much closer to where I live so I'll be to that one when I return.  The company of hikers here made the meal!"}
{"text":"What to do after a strenuous hike with a friend  at Red Rock Canyon?  Go to Rachel's Kitchen and have some food to restore some strength.  After a hike on Monday, 1/30, that's exactly what we did.

I ordered the Curry chicken wrap and my friend got their multigrain pancakes with both bananas and chocolate chips.  The wrap is a chicken curry salad with romaine lettuce, cucumbers, and mayo in a whole wheat tortilla.  You have a choice of mixed green salad, French fries, sweet potato fried or onion rings as a side.  I, of course, took the healthy route and got the French fries.

The wrap was very good.  I also got some iced tea.  It's a serve yourself counter on the side.  They had regular and passion fruit.  The passion fruit tea was very tasty.

My friends pancakes were quite good he reported.  The pancakes came with a side of fresh fruit.  After a graveyard shift at a local hospital and a tough hike, the pancakes were enough to carb up his diet to keep going.

As Candace noted, the seating is close.  The tables are small and there are a fairly good number of them in that relatively small space.  When it's warmer. I'll have to go for breakfast and eat on the patio!

I've been wanting to try Rachel's for awhile and I'm glad I did.  Their new location puts them next to a Starbucks.  Does life get any better than that?"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! Healthy fresh eating and lovely people! I come her several times a week! Love the chopped chicken salad!"}
{"text":"Can you handle the following type of crowd: Summerlin housewives fresh out of a workout, lawyers with fancy leather jackets and Harleys, Glen Lerner, and magazine ready couples with their beautiful little children? If so, you can handle Rachel's.

It was very nice out so the crowd partook in the abundance of outdoor seating. Indoors, there were only about 8-10 tables so I am unsure how they manage on cold days since it was very busy on Saturday. It is a quick order type of place in which you walk up to the counter, order, take a number and wait for them to bring it out.   

The food was WOW OH WOW! I got the chicken curry sandwich and sweet potato fries. I was given the option to substitute a fruit salad which I declined. Even though this does not sound very healthy it was as healthy as one can make a sandwich and fries. The fries were crispy but not greasy and the chicken curry was so smooth.  

I stole a bite of hubby's breakfast burrito which was so good. It was not your typical greasy, fall out of the burrito type of breakfast burrito. The pico de gallo on it was so nommerific. 

I glanced over as the waitress brought the next table over a chicken Caesar salad which looked AMAZE!

The prices were about 7-10 dollars a plate.

If you are looking for healthy, delicious, quick dining, go to Rachel's!"}
{"text":"It makes NO SENSE that this place has any bad reviews. I eat out a lot and this is where I go the most, I've been here at least fifty times and I take all my friends here. I have never had a single problem. Actually one time they forgot the pear on a salad, and replaced the whole salad no problem. They are very nice here and want you to be happy. All the food is yummy and healthy with lots of options. Another review complains about the artwork- it's done by students at local schools and is always changing so don't be ridiculous!! This restaurant supports its community."}
{"text":"This little spot is great.  Place is clean, food is fresh and staff is friendly.  Our server Justin was amazing.  It was our first time and he gave us great recommendations on the menu.  Would definitely recommend this place to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Oh, Rachel's. Living at The Ogden, I've walked by the empty storefronts on the ground floor for the last year and a half, longing for the day when they would begin to fill up with tenants. You are the first, and you get a point for blazing the downtown trail. You also get a point for NOT taking any assistance from Downtown Project's totalitarian neighborhood monopoly.

Unfortunately - at least on soft-opening day - the food just didn't add up. I haven't been to Rachels' other locations around the valley, but my wife and I ate here twice today for lunch and dinner and each time we were disappointed in the food's blandness and lack of freshness. Frozen fries, frozen onion rings, frozen breakfast potatoes and a general lack of flavor pervaded every dish we tried. I'm being brutally honest here with the hope that things improve, because DTLV desperately needs more restaurants and I desperately want to like this place.

My wife did try a peanut butter smoothie, which was very tasty, with complementary peanut butter and banana flavors. However, ultimately, we didn't have anything here that we couldn't make upstairs in our apartment."}
{"text":"Ordered to go. Food was good, and cashier was friendly."}
{"text":"I'm getting hungry again just thinking about the delicious pastas I've enjoyed there. I've had the signature and garden pastas, both very similar and both very delicious. I was glad that I was able to fill up without feeling overly full or bad about it. 
Their juices are delicious, too. The watermelon juice is exactly what it says...you can't really mess that up, and it was nice to grab a pick me up from their Energizer drink which contains beets, apples, carrots, lemon and ginger. YUMMM.
All the art they feature is awesome and for purchase too! I'll be back on one of their karaoke nights. S/O to all their extra nice employees too."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here.  I got to know this place from apartment sitting since this location is not too close to my house.

The actual location is nice and very open. Every time I have been there it has been clean and the staff has been friendly. Outside dining is available, but I am not sure how useful in the summer.

I have tried the following and would order each one, again (and I have):

- Chopped Salad w/ grilled chicken: This is the ant-lettuce salad. It. Is. Big. A great blend of chopped broccoli, red cabbage, tomatoes, olives, garbanzo beans and mozzarella cheese with a nice balsamic vinaigrette. I added chicken for protein, but it really doesn't need it. 5 stars out of 5, for me.
- Cheese Burger: Standard cheeseburger, done right, I'd rate it 7/10. I usually get the sweet potato fries which are slightly sweet, tender with a bit of crunch.
- Breakfast Burrito: I love breakfast burritos and this is pretty solid. I'd give it a solid 80%
- Curry Chicken Salad Sandwich: Curry chicken salads are usually creative. This one was pretty normal, but the flavor is 'on point.' A solid b+.

I know this is a short review, but I am remiss in not finishing this sooner."}
{"text":"Always come here for the wholesome fresh and flavorful food. I always try something new cause there are so many yummy options! I recommend the Chinese chicken salad it is so good! Also I love the Caesar wrap and the signature pasta! Also helps that is it so close to home and in a good location. It is very clean as well and good music and art on the walls. I recommend my friends to come here!"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and taste great! Only problem with this place is its so slow.. They need more employees to prepare the food and also at the register. It takes 20 minutes just to get a smoothie. So for that reason I am giving them 3 starts for poor management"}
{"text":"I like the chopped salad and club sandwich.

Not necessarily \"healthy\" but wholesome.

The outdoor seating area is nice in the fall or a spring day.

I throw this in to the mix for lunch once and a while, but only on days that I have more than 60 minutes available."}
{"text":"They have a great fresh and healthy menu. Their salads and wraps are delicious. They have a fresh juices which I love."}
{"text":"The smoothies and fresh pressed juices are great. It's awesome to fine such a healthy place so close to Vegas. They are open early and have a good selection of breakfasts. I enjoyed the Hawaiian smoothie. I will crave one til I go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered to-go about 5 times and 1 Take-out order over the phone.
This was about a week ago when we ordered take out over the phone.  
We always order same thing. Turkey Club or Cobb Salad, Garden Pasta and Soup.

This time we ordered Turkey Club and Garden Pasta and Broccoli cream soup. Turkey Club was same but this time i ordered sweet potato fries instead of Onion rings because they only give you 3 onion rings.  Garden Pasta was disappointing because not only pasta was breaking like it's been sitting in the water too long and pasta was watery and half of the portion compared to previous togo orders. 

It makes me angry when food i order lacks consistency in taste and portion.  

Your Establishment isn't cheap but when you mess up take out orders it really makes people feel cheated and never want to go back.  We are no long ordering food from here because we feel that last meal was complete act of thievery or con or whatever. 

When you pick up your order ask them to show you the food instead of just packing it away so you can prevent this.... which you shouldn't have to... arrggg

I usually understand error or mistake such as wrong item and missed item and such because it could happen.  BUT when I can't get the consistent quality on food I do not go back because I do not want to gamble with food."}
{"text":"$17 for a burger, sweet potato fries and smoothie.  Yeah, that's a lot to be paying for this.  But we're talking about healthy eating and I'd recommend this place if you like to watch what you eat. 

However, I don't watch what I eat and I'd have to say this is pricey.  My last visit I ordered the Garden Burger with sweet potato fries and a regular smoothie.  As far as what I'd recommend, I can't really say.  Look at the ingredients and see what's in your diet and what's not.  Staff knows a lot about their items so you can ask them too.  They've screwed up my to go order a couple times but fixed it when I drove back to let them know.  And another time they forgot to put the protein in my smoothie.

I frequent the Summerlin location but before that I would have to go to South Summerlin for a Rachel's Kitchen visit.  I'm glad to see their business spread throughout different parts of the valley."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here around noon on a Sunday with our dog and took a seat outside for a quick lunch. The atmosphere is very kid and dog friendly and the place seemed really clean and efficient. I saw a lot of couples, families, and people in yoga wear (its really close to a few studios). 

We ordered:

Sweet Greens (fresh juice): (3/5) This one had kale, spinach, cucumber, celery, apple, lemon & ginger root. I usually make my juice at home with the same ingredients so I'm pretty picky about the balance. It was very celery/cucumber heavy with barely a hint of kale or spinach. Also, it had a hint of bitterness because they used unpeeled cucumbers. I did like that it wasn't overly sweet with excessive apple (some places do that).

Energizer (fresh juice): (4/5) This one had beets, apples, carrots, lemon and ginger root. I only had a few sips of this since it wasn't mine. It had good combination that didn't have a super metallic taste of beets and very little hint of the lemon and ginger.

Acai bowl: (3/5) Small bowl but fairly yummy. The acai and banana are blended together so don't go digging for pieces of banana, like I was trying to do. It was more like a bowl of granola with a topping of acai/banana blend so I felt like it was a bit pricy for what you get. 

Blueberry muffin: (5/5) Free muffin with check-in. Total score!! This muffin was amazing. Seriously. It's as if a super fluffy biscuit and a blueberry muffin had a baby. It is very light, full of flavor, and doesn't sit heavy in your stomach. 

Side of bacon: (5/5) Because, bacon."}
{"text":"I love this location! Food is always great and the customer service as well. Didnt give 5 stars since I dont agree with the \"tip\" as you pay, their cashiers who put in an order. You arent serving me at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I was staying at Green Valley Ranch and desperately in need of some good coffee (Starbucks actually opened there two days before I left). I happened on Rachel's Kitchen, and I found some quality coffee along with more upscale accompaniments like soy and almond milks. I chose the breakfast burrito with bacon and eggs, but there were many more vegetarian and innovative options as well for breakfast. While I found the prices slightly pricey, this is a unique stand out in an area with chains and fast food."}
{"text":"Great place, with a relaxed environment. It's a go to lunch spot. Their Tomato Basil Pasta and Watermelon Juice is a must!"}
{"text":"I love to eat there ! Will recommend on their grilled cheese ! Very good and tasty !!"}
{"text":"By far the worst chicken Caesar wrap I ever had in my life. I usually go to the one on hualapai but my mom wanted to  go to this one. I almost threw up on my plate, and maybe would have had the audacity to eat my throwup lol. That's how bad it was.

The one on hualapai is the best! That's where the magic happens !"}
{"text":"Love this little gourmet cafe joint.  Been coming here for years mainly for their pasta esp. The Angel Hair with Bolognese Sauce.  It is divineeee!  

Of course they're not limited to just pasta.  I tried their burgers, grilled cheese sammich, breakfasts stuff, soops, salads, and recently just discovered their BBQ Chicken Wrap.   I'm no big fan of BBQ sauce, but this one was perfect.  Filled with grilled chicken lightly toss in BBQ sauce, lettuce, and their famous Onion Rings.  Mmmmm~ MMM.  Remind me of the Western Cheeseburger from Carl's Jr, without that feeling of guilt of all that calorie intake.  Wash it all down with a cup of their Fresh Watermelon Juice and you have yourself a wonderful meal.

Only downfall is that price may be a little too moderate, but it is Summerlin.   Now would be the best time to enjoy lunch here since the weather is perfect.  Heck, even the air here feels like Summerlin!

I am 90% certain that Hours are from 7am-7pm

4.5!"}
{"text":"I love the food but every time I come to this location my order gets messed up. Being a vegetarian it has great options but not so great when they still put chicken in your pasta when you tell them to leave it off. I called in curbside pickup because I am on my way to work and now I am stuck waiting another 20 minutes for them to remake it, now I'm going to be rushed to work. Last time I was here I just asked the girl for a side of chili flakes I was halfway done with my food when I asked her again then she still kept doing what she was going them finally got the chili flakes after. I mean by that point I was almost done. Another time I was here I ordered my food on a spinach wrap and it comes out with thick bread. Like I said great food but yikes on the customer service and preparation they defiantly need to pay more attention to the customer I would have been livid if I didn't realize the chicken in my pasta. Very disappointed because they do have great menu options, but awed up dining experience almost every time I have been here or picked up to go. So if you come here just really pay attention and always check to make sure your food is how you would like it. Hopefully they pay more attention from now on, someone could be allergic to something and if you don't care and don't pay attention in the food industry you could send them to the hospital."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen - (McCarran Airport / Terminal 3)

Rachel's Kitchen located inside the gates of Terminal 3 is always a good option when you're looking for something quick, healthy, and not overly priced.  One thing to point out....the menu is scaled back significantly compared to their typical locations.  I got their breakfast sandwich and coffee for less than $10.  Price wise, this was a bargain compared to the other restaurants in the area.  Taste wise, just okay and shouldn't be compared to their actual restaurants outside of the airport.  

TIP #1:   Located at the D Gates"}
{"text":"Had this one bookmarked once I heard this location was opening soon.  Didn't even realize it was walking distance from the gym that I hit from time to time.  Also didn't realize that it finally opened.  

First visit was a couple of weeks ago and didn't put in a review because all I had was their Peanut Butter Blaster.  I had this minus the banana and added a scoop of whey protein. Simply delicious and a perfect post-workout since there's at least 30 grams of protein between the scoop and peanut butter. Had their Smoked Turkey and Avocado Sandwich on my most recent visit.  I had the avocado deleted and it was perfect.  Usually a turkey sandwich anywhere is bland unless you have condiments.  This sandwich wasn't.  The smoked turkey is a good touch and so good that I can't wait to come back for more.  Friend of mine had their Curry Chicken Salad.  She loved it and killed it so I know it was good.  

Rachel's Kitchen has a lot to offer.  From oat meals to burgers, smoothies to healthy sandwiches, you really can't go wrong dining here.  Service is great as usual and the restaurant is clean.  With this location so close to one of my gyms, I'm sure that I'll be back very very soon.  Word!!!"}
{"text":"Hanging out at The District and looking for eats that promises to be fresh, consistent, and affordable? Then you can't go wrong with Rachel's Kitchen. I've been to the Summerlin location and always received quality eats with great service. 

This location is little different than the other spots since it's located in a shopping mall.  There's a wide variety of food from smoothies, oatmeals, sandwiches, and wraps. My usual order is their Smoked Avocado Turkey Sandwich and their PB Blast.  On this visit, I got their Turkey Burger, Sweet Potato Fries, and their Peanut Butter Blast w/extra protein. The turkey burger wasn't as big as other joints, but was definitely tastier.  One thing about some turkey burgers is that they can get a little dry.  Rachel's is just perfect and almost taste like a real burger minus the high calories. My friend loves their Chicken Curry Sandwich and decided to change it to a wrap on this visit.  She killed it so I assume that was was good too.  

One thing about this location is that it's a little busier than the Summerlin location.  This location has a different vibe, but still has the great service.  I love the Summerlin location and may be a little biased since that's the location that I frequent.  Overall, I'm still a fan of Rachel's and will continue to pay a visit when I'm in The District."}
{"text":"Review update: Tried this place again and it was much better. Maybe because we skipped the veggie burger this time and went with the tomato pasta. It had good seasoning and came with enough for 2 people to share. As always, the fresh juices were amazing. (Sweet greens)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast based on the reviews here. The food was good, but not super flavorful. Great for a healthy alternative to the usual downtown grub. The service was great. Our guy made sure we were well taken care of. Very close to Fremont strip and walking distance from the hotel if you want to escape the deep fried twinkles and grab some fresh, healthy food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's next door my to my work so I order here pretty often... Food is always ready when I call ahead. Everyone there is so nice, helpful and efficient. I continue to recommend my family and friends here and they love it here as well. :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Everyone at my table was served 10 mins and was done eating, by the time the food was ready. Had to get my meal to go. Not sure what's happening with the timing, but doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok....I confess, I'm a huge fan of Rachel's Kitchen.  Always healthy, consistent in quality and so delicious. 

Today, I had the 440 Sandwich in a spinach wrap.  Truth be told, I was dreaming about this sandwich last night in my sleep and was excited to know after boot camp that it would be the next meal consumed. 

Oh....so back to the 440....grilled chicken, goat cheese (I think it is the goat cheese that really pulls this together), avacado, roasted red pepper, roasted tomatoes and lettuce.  The wrap makes it snug, which I like, but you can also have it on bread.  Delicious! 

Healthy, delicious and in DTLV (downtown Las Vegas)"}
{"text":"Kind of an oasis of relatively clean eating in a sea of relatively poor standard airport food options.  Based out of California, but located all over Las Vegas and patronized by the healthy set on the Las Vegas valley, this is a great spot to grab a quick healthy bite. 

Peet's Coffee is their brand of brew.  I grabbed a fruit bowl and a large coffee today, which set me back about $9.50 USD.  Pricey a touch, but the fruit bowl is really a great fruit bowl.  Not some skimpy thing with a few pieces of melon and pineapple and saying they are a fruit bowl, but blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, pineapple, watermelon, cantaloupe, etc.  And fresh!  Packed that morning, according to the label."}
{"text":"So much positive Chi in this place.  Does not have a corporate feel to it.  Always very welcoming when I walk in with genuine smiles.  Coffee is amazing"}
{"text":"I had 2 eggs and bacon. The eggs were not runny and the bacon was crisp like I like it. They have free refills for coffee I also liked the outdoor seating. Nice setup and inexpensive. You order at the counter and they bring it to you."}
{"text":"People seriously over do it with these reviews. Mac n cheese is not good at all, way over creamed, and taste terrible.  sandwiches are very sloppy, not much meat. And the fries...thanks for the small handfull of fries you gave me. I would give this half a star if I could."}
{"text":"The food is really good here but the staff is never friendly. I had stopped by to grab lunch to go and had my son with me. As I was walking out with carseat in one hand, bag of food in the other some employees were walking back in from the patio and couldnt even hold the door open for me when they saw me and and just let it shut on my carseat. Clearly my hands were full. Extremely rude and makes me never want to come back regardless of how good their food is."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Rachel's. I love a great cafe with an al fresco option, unfortunately Rachel's was a huge disappointment. The staff was dismissive and one girl was down right rude. The outdoor ambiance was amazing, but I really couldn't get over the careless staff. To compound the poor experience the food was just meh. We won't be back to Rachel's."}
{"text":"Went to Rachel's looking for a healthy fresh breakfast to start my day! That is exactly what I got! I ordered the breakfast burrito which was filled with fluffy eggs, cheese, diced tomatoes and avocado the burrito came with a side of diced fried potatoes (that were not greasy) and ketchup...very delish! I also ordered the watermelon juice and it was awesome! I would recommend this spot for sure. I heard they have amazing salads so I am definitely going back to try lunch!"}
{"text":"This is ridiculous! 20+ minutes waiting for a to go salad..... A SALAD!!!!!  There was only two orders ahead of me and I saw people behind me getting served first!"}
{"text":"Located in the Ogden building a block from Freemont Street, this place is great for breakfast or lunch and offers a couple great smoothies! I love their breakfast wrap which comes with potatoes on the side. Overall the food is good, the staff is friendly, and with wifi you can come there to get some work done too."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 2008.  It's reliable and always good, never changes.  I love everything I've ever had.  I like the pastas, they give you a lot and for to go orders, they package it in a foil container, which makes it easy to just throw in the toaster oven for reheating, as I use the microwave as little as possible.  I sometimes like getting the lunch combo when they have cream of broccoli soup for the day.  I also love 'the favorite' for breakfast.  All salads all burgers are good!  All juices!  I frequent here also because it's inviting for people eating solo."}
{"text":"With Vegas full of corporate chains ie Mcdonalds, pizza hit, subway etc it was finally refreshing to find a place like Rachel's Kitchen. The menu is full of great healthy fresh options which are hard to find in Las Vegas. The service is always great but when it is a little busy it might take a little longer to get your meal. Any of the juice options can be a little strong if it's your first time trying them. 

I recommend this place if your looking for an healthy alternative to the regular places"}
{"text":"First time customer today.. Inside the restaurant was very cute and relaxing, the young guy who took our order was very nice and helpful. Husband and I both got burgers and fries, so delicious! Just a tip, should add some pickles :) I'll definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Been to Rachel's Kitchen twice and unfortunately I'm not that impressed with the food (sandwiches here).  I had the curry chicken salad and my husband had the ultimate grilled cheese and both were average.  I will griped a little about the price because for the two of us with drinks, the total was over $30 -- That's a bit much for sandwiches,for the portion and the taste."}
{"text":"Around afternoon time they give a normal amount of fries for a meal. I think the night shift cooks are too lazy to make fries when it comes closer to closing time.  If you order at night they give barley any fries at all, maybe half the amount that is given for a normal meal. Start giving the right amount of fries for all times, instead of cooks being too lazy to make more fries, and I'll give a 5 star review. Simple!"}
{"text":"Egg white wrap on whole wheat, bacon, cheddar, avocado!
very yummy breakfast"}
{"text":"LORD HAVE MERCY! The signature penne pasta is something that I now crave on a constant basis. The dish includes a creamy tomato sauce with mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, chicken and eggplant, which makes for an amazingly tasty meal. I have finally found something worth coming to Rachel's Kitchen for. Guess I just wasn't too lucky my first 2 experiences, but third times a charm."}
{"text":"I went today for the first time with my I inlaws. They go regularly and love it. I thought the place was ok. The food was ok but nothing special in my opinion and the cost seemed a little high for what we got. 

I did like the outside patio though because we had my 17 month old with us. She doesn't like to sit still and would rather wander around. It wasn't too crowded so we were out there so the kiddo could walk around, enjoy herself, and not bother other patrons, and we could enjoy our lunch as well. 

I would probably go back with my inlaws, but it really isn't my first choice in the area."}
{"text":"I really like Rachel's Kitchen, the one here at The District has a nice, relaxing feeling. There's indoor and outdoor seating, outdoors being dog friendly. 

I have ordered the curried chicken salad, turkey burger, and Popeyes green juice. All were very tasty and fresh. My hubby has ordered the \"create your own\" omelette that came with country potatoes and toast, he commented it was basic, but filling. Another time he ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad which he liked very much. The watermelon juice was another pick which he said was refreshing. 

They have breakfast lunch and dinner items that are healthier in options elsewhere. Not really organic or GMO-free I believe, but there is a still a healthier feel in the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing Food!! Stopped by for a quick business meeting and had amazing smoothie and wrap!! Make sure you sign up for the Loyalty Program!! Staff is so great.. can't wait to return again."}
{"text":"My company frequently orders from Rachel's as it is in close proximity. I've personally placed orders about 15-20 times and only once was delivery available. I would like to point out I make these orders hours in advance, not last minute. 

Today delivery was not available so, as usual, and I had to go pick up the order. I called at 10:50 am and was told the order would take 15-20 minutes. I asked to have it ready by 11:30 (it gave them extra time) and I was assured it was no problem. When I arrived to pick up the order, SURPRISE...it was not done. I spent the next 30 minutes waiting past the time my order was promised. No one apologized or even acknowledged that is was late, no one cared. I asked if all of the food was correct and I was assured it was. 

The food was packaged horribly and it tipped over and spilled in my car (not due to my driving). Also, when I got back to my office I realized they forgot part of my order and this is not the first time this has happened. I drive back and again, no one apologized or cared they forgot part of my order. They seemed annoyed I was back to get the rest of it.

When I finally get back to my office and open the food and half of it was not closed properly and food was leaking and coming our of the packaging. One order with chicken was not fully cooked and still pink. The cheese on the grilled cheese was not even melted. We ordered fettuccine alfredo and added bacon and they forgot the bacon, however I still paid for bacon. Also, a couple bags of chips were missing. 

You'd think when you order close to $200 in food a couple times a month they could for once:
1. Deliver the food
2. Have the food ready at the time they promise - not 30 mins. late
3. Get the order correct
4. Pack all items ordered and paid for
5. At the very least apologize for the huge inconvenience they've caused multiple times


UPDATE: I was contacted by Rachel's Kitchen. The manager came to our office and brought us a dessert tray as an apology, which was nice. They also issued a refund on our order. I truly appreciate the gesture and we will give them another try sometime.

UPDATE: We ordered from them again today and the manager personally delivered the food and was super apologetic. The food was on time today and our order was correct. We truly appreciate their efforts and their sincere apology!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, they forgot out smoothies for the entire time we were there, refunded out money, taut was more of a hassle than anything. Please try to follow through on menu items, especially when it wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"The service here was quite excellent, but the food was some of the most bland items I have ever eaten. I would have expected me to enjoy some of this even if it wasn't to my exact tastes since I had been fasting for over 18 hours, and was quite famished when I arrived here.

Ordered the 440 Sandwich on wheat, which I was recommended by the staff but wasn't informed that it had avocado on it (I hate avocado, but almost all of their sandwiches have it). I ordered sweet potato fries for my side and a medium drink of Tropical passion tea (no sugar).

The 440 sounded delicious with goat cheese, roasted peppers, tomato, and lettuce on a grilled chicken breast (plus the avocado), but when I received this item, it was immediately apparent how easily it would fall apart. Not to mention that it had almost no flavor to it whatsoever.

The sweet potato fries were so bland that I had to salt and dip them in ketchup to have almost any flavor for them.

Sadly, the best thing I had was the tea...

Definitely a no go on the food here for me."}
{"text":"I visited this Rachel's Kitchen on Sunday afternoon when I realized Einstein's nearby closed at 4:10 on Sundays.  I missed it by 3 minutes so I drove around seeing what was nearby.  I had never heard of Rachel's Kitchen before so I decided to drive up to it and when my boyfriend and I saw that they serve smoothies I went in because that was just what my boyfriend wanted.  The place reminded me of a Panera where you order your food up front then take a number and someone brings you your food or you take it there yourself.  Nessa was very helpful to me figuring out the menu of what was offered.  She helped me customize a banana-blueberry smoothie for my boyfriend who waited in the car, as well as a 440 sandwich and watermelon juice for myself.  The 440 sandwich came with a choice of some sides and I got onion rings.  The 440 sandwich was chicken, goat cheese and avocado on a bread of your choice.  I chose ciabiatta.  The sandwich itself was decent and the onion rings were okay.  The watermelon juice was fresh from a juicer and Nessa made it herself in front of me.  For the price of the food it's pretty good, and Nessa's service made it a nice experience.  I'm sure I will come back here for a juice fix when I don't feel like making it myself."}
{"text":"Watermelon juice is yummy...bbq chicken wrap is yummy too. Thanks to my friend Brenda another good recommendation."}
{"text":"We enjoyed delicious salads on their wonderful patio. The service was fast. The food was fresh and well prepared. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"So today was my first time trying this place out, and I'm certain I'll be back.  I have a very sensitive intolerance to gluten ( I have celiac disease) so I have to be careful where I eat.  I am so glad they had gluten free options.  The one thing that really bummed me was that the sweet potato fries (that I love to devour) aren't cooked in separate oil from the breaded chicken, so they are contaminated and aren't gluten free. If they had separate fryers they would have a great addition to the gluten free menu.  But maybe one day they will and I can try them! But until then, I'll be happy with the sandwiches, burgers, pasta and calm, bright atmosphere (perfect for after yoga)!"}
{"text":"What is the big hype about this restaurant? The food has no flavor, the atmosphere is boring and cold and the staff has NEVER gotten an order right. The only upside to a wrong order is they sometimes have a \"no problem\" attitude and fix it. Salads have too much dressing, pasta is over cooked. I so wish my kid didn't like it here. I'm done and next time she craves Rachel's, I'm not going."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp while looking for good food nearby. We ordered to go and usually this takes away from the flavor, but not this time. 

We were happily surprised to find that the pasta, burger and salads we ordered were all delicious. Special thanks to the kitchen staff who were able to bang our food out in a timely manner with awesome quality."}
{"text":"My first time trying Rachel's Kitchen. Food was awesome and really generous portions. I'll definitely be back since I live here."}
{"text":"Most likely will not visit again. Overpriced for what you get. Slow service and cold food is unacceptable when there was one order before us."}
{"text":"I've been to Rachel's Kitchen a couple of times but I've never had breakfast. I've been eyeballing their chocolate chip banana pancakes so that's what I finally got. 

It was pretty sweet to me so I didn't need any syrup. It came with fresh fruit which I'm allergic to honeydew and cantaloupe but that's alright. 3 pancakes for 8 bucks...was it worth it? No. It was good, but not $8 good. 

I think for what you get at Rachel's Kitchen for the cost is not worth it. I'm willing to spend  money on great food, but I've never been impressed with this place unfortunately."}
{"text":"I love the ladies at this location! Yesenia is particularly helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, and provided the best customer service! 

The food and smoothies are super healthy yet still delicious. Also, bonus points for convenience. The complex this place is located in has everything you could possibly need-Smith's, gas station, European Wax Center, Starbucks. 

I'm definitely a satisfied customer!"}
{"text":"Meh. The quality and quantity of their food is definitely a let down, especially considering their pricing. Its just ok for most part. I guess in a town of corporate food chains this place is a nice change of pace though."}
{"text":"Everything was just , ehh, ok. Today was my first time eating here, and my wife raves about it, but I was hardly impressed. From the uncomfortable seating and tiny tables to the lackluster chicken breast sandwich I paid way too much for, I just couldn't get into it. My wife likes the burgers here but I found it dry and plain. The kids did like the Mac and cheese though. Good location and people watching. I'll probably give it one more chance some other time..."}
{"text":"My cousin lives nearby so we stopped to grab dinner one night. 

There were lots of things on the menu that sounded appealing. I decided to go with the \"440 Sandwich\" - I mean, you can't really go wrong with grilled chicken, goat cheese, avocado and red peppers, right? That was my thinking, anyways. The sandwich was good, but the goat cheese was the dominant flavor. I love goat cheese, so that was fine with me. The fries that came with my sandwich were pretty standard, but good.

My friend ordered the signature pasta, I think. I tasted a few bites and thought it was yummy. The tomato cream sauce could have maybe been a bit more tomato-y, but I still thought it was good.

The wine portions are tiny, so if you decide to drop $12 on a glass, just know you aren't going to get much of it.

If you live in the area, this would be a great place to go for lunch or dinner every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Well, the location is perfect, especially if you want to eat outside under the trees.
But for the prices, I wasn't especially impressed.  It was good, don't get me wrong, but for $26 - 2 people for lunch, eh, I could have made something at home that was better & way less.
The tropical iced tea was horrible, and this is coming from a very picky tea snob, so I think the average person might have liked it.  My standards are very high.  The service was fast & friendly & the restaurant was quite clean. 
I will give them props for having a few Gluten-Free items on their menu.  
Not sure I'll go back, but it was an overall nice-ish experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. It was very clean and had friendly service. We sat outside and the chairs and very comfortable with cute glass tile tables and a nice water feature. We had scrambled eggs with bacon. Eggs were a perfect consistency and the bacon was cooked perfectly. The potatoes that came on the side were hot and crispy. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Very good and healthy!  Coffee was so so.  Juices very good. Prices about a dollar too much.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"I took my nephew to have breakfast on Sunday and he loved it!  The staff was friendly and attentive.  The food was delicious and the price is right"}
{"text":"So upset, I love Rachel's kitchen, however today I ordered a to go meal and got back to my office only to discover that they made a mistake and gave me regular fries and not sweet potato fries! Lesson learned check your meal before you leave.
The 440 sandwich as a lettuce wrap- very good!!!


Update: I was immediately contacted by Rachel's Kitchen and offered a gift card for my faulted experience, that's great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"God. I'm spoiled rotten. When I moved back to Vegas after living in DC and San Fran, all I heard was how great, fresh, awesome and wholesome this place was from my BFs. Being in San Fran, you get so used to fresh and healthy and organic everything, you get so jaded, and take stuff like that for granted. In Vegas, there is not a lot of really fresh, organic FAST fare, save a Whole Foods, etc, so I jumped at the chance to try this place. After my fresh pedicure at Alexus Nail Bar, (which is in the same center) I ventured over to met my friend for lunch. First, I was shocked to see how small it was. I guess that is either here nor there, but every damn table was taken inside and out. And with the snotty Summerlin types. Ugh. But  I thought, ok...it's busy, that's a good sign I guess.  I ordered the turkey and avocado sandwich and a tea. Almost 15 bucks. Grrr. Then it came. Pretty small and unimpressive. Didn't look like it was made with any love, that's for sure. And it tasted like a preprepared sandwich at say, a Fresh and Easy or a Whole Foods. But wait. I liked the preprepared sandwiches from Fresh and Easy and Whole Foods a lot better. 
I guess I can say that I'm glad that places like Rachel's even exist in Vegas and are making the effort. For that, I applaud them. The last thing this town needs is another KFC or Taco Bell. We just don't have fast,  fresh organic food as readily available here from \"non- chains\" like they have on the coasts. I always had access to places like that, but here, yes, we have some of the best restaurants in the world on the strip, etc, but after that, you mostly have chains or non healthy fast food places. \"Healthy\" is just still not a buzzword here. So I guess I am a spoiled snob who just HATES that about Vegas.
As far as Rachel's Kitchen goes, I don't care what anyone says. This place does not live up to my standards for what you are supposedly paying for. You're better off getting a made to order sandwich at Whole Foods.
 Pass."}
{"text":"I tried to come here a couple of times but it is usually quite hard to find an empty table. I was able to come here at an in between time of 3pm and was able to score a table outside next to people lunching with their doggies. 

I decided to order their 440 sandwich and some sweet potato fries. I was also pleased to find beer on their menu as some fast-casual places do not always have that as an option. 

The sweet potato fries were delicious--cooked and cut to my person preference for sweet potato fries (no extra sugar on them, not too thick, slight crisp). The 400 sandwich on ciabatta was great as I love anything with goat cheese. 

It was nice to finally try out this spot in person as I have also tried it for office functions. Lovely wraps and I am a big fan of their salad dressing."}
{"text":"Great food, a little pricey but it does fill you up depending what you get! Watermelon juice is made fresh and tastes great!"}
{"text":"hmm... smoothie was ok. Nothing special. Chinese chicken salad was bland. At least the juice was fresh. They need to move the register next to the display case. The treats inside are easily missed and sort of an afterthough. So when it comes to deciding on grabbing a treat for after lunch you've already paid and decided to opt out. Especially since none of it looked fresh. Note to owner: you'll move a lot more out of that case if you move your register. The round tables and mountain of chairs make it feel a bit claustrophobic. Booths are nice though. Place is clean. Kind of pricey for a salad. Would've preferred a smaller portion on the salad and the spaghetti. This place is a star better than the other \"Kitchen\" with the same menu."}
{"text":"In my mind, there are three kinds of restaurants. 1. Restaurants that serve food that you could never recreate. 2. Restaurants that serve food that you could attempt to make, but it wouldn't be as good. and 3. Restaurants that serve food that you could absolutely recreate and it would taste just as good if not better. Rachel's Kitchen (ON WARM SPRINGS) is a category 3 restaurant. 
We ordered the turkey club on wheat, smoked turkey and avocado on french, and smoked turkey and avocado on ciabatta. At only $1 more the turkey club is slightly bigger in portion and a much better tasting sandwich. The sandwich is smaller when made on a ciabatta compared to the french bread. They weren't bad, but they weren't that great either. If someone asked me what a grocery store pre-made deli sandwiches tasted like, I would wrap the smoked turkey and avocado from Rachel's Kitchen in some saran wrap and give them that. I was not impressed. 
Free muffin with Yelp check-in- too bad the muffin was as hard as a rock! When were they baked? Definitely not today. 
Again, the food isn't bad, but for the price I would want something better. The restaurant is cute and the outdoor section is a nice place to sit if the weather is nice. If I come back, it'll be because I'm paying for the atmosphere and not the food. 
The Rachel's Kitchen at the District was better than this location."}
{"text":"Park more toward the West end of GVR- It's closer to the casino than toward REI. 
Nothing fancy, nothing extraordinary. However, Rachel's Kitchen is cheap, fast and pretty good. They serve breakfast all day, have sandwiches, pastas, salads, coffee and MIMOSAS. 
We ordered the chicken salad sandwich- 3/5 and the smoked turkey and avocado sandwich- 4/5. There was a huge amount of turkey in my sandwich! The chicken salad was boring. The smoked turkey had a nice slightly spicy kick to it. 
They both came with a choice of sides- order the sweet potato fries over the plain fries. 
Coffee was significantly cheaper than what it would be at Coffee Bean next door, but wasn't spectacular. However, the caffeine got the job done. 
It's a cute place to go for breakfast/brunch and the walk around GVR is a nice way to let the food digest (Not that their meals are heavy or their portions very big!)"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a DTLA food tour and it was one of my favorite stops on the tour. We sampled the chicken salad & a PB smoothie, but my favorite by far was their signature pasta. It was delicious! This was a pleasant surprise, considering I had them pegged for a typical cold lunch (soup/sandwich) type of place. I would have ordered more if it wasn't the first stop on our tour! I will definitely be going back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Good service and great location. Had their pancakes and a mimosa. The turkey bacon is the best! Now one of my go to for breakfast or brunch spots."}
{"text":"Love this place. We eat here often. I love the tuna salad sandwich and the cream of mushroom soup. All the food we have tried is always really good and the service is super nice."}
{"text":"Honestly, it's just ok. We've ordered two omlet dishes that came out pretty quick but were lacking spices and flavor in general. 

My husband's toast was super dry and cold, and my not-so-hot coffee was served after i finished my meal. 

So overall, I've had better experiences in other \"Rachel's kitchen\" branches and most definitely better experiences in better breakfast restaurants."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend here and I got the Curry Chicken Wrap with sweet potato fries. It was my first time and I really enjoyed the healthy meal. It was delicious. Love their Energizer fresh squeezed juice too!"}
{"text":"I heard this place originated in Beverly Hills and the owner opened a second location here in Vegas. Totally feels like Beverly Hills, with the mosaic tables and all. 

Rachel's Kitchen sits in the heart of Summerlin. When we got there, there was about twenty kids around kindergarten age, chaperoned by four women. Rich women who drove Navigators and such. 

My bf and I ordered a burger and a drink apiece, plus bf's soup and our bill came out to just under $30. 

The soup was a vegetarian split pea soup. It lacked that certain wholesome, salty, smokey, meatiness that meat gives, but I always appreciate a meatless alterantive ... even though tasty meat is so tasty ... 

Bf got a gorgonzola burger. He said it seemed healthy, fresh, and nicely portioned, \"a nice alternative to like, Chili's.\" They sub out Gardenburgers for any burger patty, so I got a sauteed mushroom Gardenburger with swiss. It was pretty basic. I paid $8.50 for that bad boy. 

The fries and onion rings were mediocre. 

I also got an Incredible Hulk, a smoothie with banana, PB, tofu, and some other stuff. It was a'ight. 

The lady helping us was super friendly and acoomodating. 

The place had about eight small tables, each could sit two adults or four rugrats. 

I'd like to go back and check out their pastas. Worth going back. 

Everything on the menu is under $10. But right under $10, ya know.

{"text":"Estuve para tomar un almuerzo ligero, probé un delicioso sandwich tostado de pollo y queso, muy rico, el pan era negro y con buena textura.. Lo acompañe con un Delicioso té con leche. La atención muy buena y muy lindo el local. Seguro que volveré para probar otros platos que se apreciaban muy sabrosos."}
{"text":"Afortunadamente encontré este local en el aeropuerto de Las Vegas y aproveché para disfrutar un rico café latte con un sandwich tostado de queso. La comida de este lugar es muy rica y fresca. La atención del personal fue muy buena. El local estaba impecable, y tenía una buena provisión de productos."}
{"text":"They catered an event I was attending and the sandwiches were really good.  I also enjoyed the salad that was provided and felt like the whole meal came together nicely. They had a good variety to choose from and the healthy options were great. I would definitely recommend them for lunch!"}
{"text":"This review is only for breakfast as I've never had lunch here. I've been to Vegas twice now and always look forward to going to Rachel's! This is a great spot for a healthier, low-key breakfast if you're staying downtown. 

It's counter service, but they bring your food to your table, so a win-win in my opinion. The wraps are so big they must have like 5 eggs in them, and come with the most delicious side of little fried breakfast potatoes. And multi-grain banana chocolate chip pancakes with fruit for $8?! It's a steal! Pancakes are rich, moist and full of toppings.

Smoothie and juice bar is a wonderful addition if you're looking to do a lighter option. They also have a selection of baked goods that I'm always too full for but look delicious!

Wonderful place and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Love love love! You can't go wrong with a healthy meal but don't worry they have treats too. Yummy grilled cheese and onion rings if you're in the mood. Always a great meal."}
{"text":"Just stopped by to grab a turkey club some Mac n Cheese and a wrap 45 minutes later I'm ready to go.  Pretty sure my food was ready for 15 minutes before they asked why I was waiting. Told them my name and oh yea here it is, way to make a customer feel special....."}
{"text":"We were in LV overnight on our way to Zion and looking for a more wholesome choice for breakfast. Rachels was perfect for our gluten free,  vegetarian,  low fat and carnivorous family members.  Tasty, interesting menu choices, well prepared and delicious.  And friendly service on top!  Loved it and highly recommend it,  especially the scrambled eggs with tomato and basil!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Rachel's Kitchen for a while, but due to not being near one, my visits were very infrequent. Now that I am working a few blocks away at The Mob Museum, I visit this one more frequently. On my last visit I had the breakfast burrito. The burrito is freshly prepared and I can taste the individual ingredients. I like the breakfast burritos here because they aren't overly salty or covered in sauce. I am a fan of the simple side of potatoes as well because I can choose what I put on them as opposed to them coming heavily salted.  

As I am kind of a coffee fiend, I like that they have almond milk as a self-serve option beyond your typical milk and cream! 

The location is nice because the dining area is fairly large, a great place for lunch (or in my case usually breakfast) meetings. The staff is friendly and attentive and the facility is one of the cleanest places to eat downtown. 

I am happy that I have a healthy option nearby that is also kind to my wallet."}
{"text":"We had a group of 25 women that had a get together here. We warned them ahead of time and they were completely prepared. Got confused a bit on where the orders went but that was to be expected. The service was faster than expected. The food was great as always."}
{"text":"This place was ok. I had a tuna wrap and it was just ok. I really liked my husbands Chinese chicken salad. I really liked my sweet potato fries. 
You get in line to place your order then they give you a number so someone can bring your order. 
For 4 people it was about $35. Not bad for the amount of food."}
{"text":"So if you like any additional flavor outside of the listed ingredients, this is NOT the place for you. 

Everything I got (Caesar Salad, 440 sandwich and the fries (reg and sweet potato) are very bland to my taste buds. Not just using salt isn't what I mean, everything I mentioned was $28. In the price range for lunch, I expect some sort of flavors, even if it's oil & fresh herbs. Or sandwiches that maybe incorporate more fruit and flavors to help bring out the base flavor of protein and vegetables being cooked and used. 

Ok I'm done. Just Not for me. IMO"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast / brunch spot. Good food and decent service. It's never too busy. They even have live music events now.  Great smoothies!"}
{"text":"the service is slow and the food is average. My fíance ordered the sauteéd mushroom burger medium well and I ordered the Bbq bacon burger with the sauce on the side. The burgers  were on whole wheat buns with fries as the side. The serving side of the burger was perfect, the meat was juicy and well prepared. The side seemed small but if you take into account the size of the burger I really could not have eaten any more fries. We got the tropical passion tea and sweetened it eith raspberry. Over all the lunch was ok but we probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Such a good find and in a great place near my work. I've heard of Rachel's Kitchen but never took the time to order from here because I normally bring my lunch. Well just happened that one of the physicians I work for decided to extend his hours on Christmas Eve and boy, us staff were not happy. He must of felt the daggers in his back when he'd walk past because he decided to buy us lunch to compensate. So, we placed an order for about 15 people and Rachel's Kitchen did such a good job.

We ordered for lunch but I was happy to be able to also order breakfast items as well (ha ha McDonalds). I ordered a Proteins Lover's Scramble. Most of my co-workers ordered lunches consisting of wraps, burgers and salads and some smoothies. Mind you by the time I got my food, I expected it to be lukewarm or cold but my eggs were hot and tasty in a heat insulating container. My meal came with home fries too. I'm not normally into potatoes (hash browns, etc.) but they were so good I decided to write a review! The eggs were real eggs, not restaurant egg product. I consider myself a food nazi which is why I choose to bring my lunch to work everyday but Rachel's food seems like quality worth paying for. I now know where I will be eating when I'm not prepared with my own lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a quiet Saturday afternoon stroll through GVR. I got the tuna wrap with fries, wife got a chicken salad with arugula and goat cheese, and we got a bowl of mac and cheese for the kid. 

The tuna wrap was \"ok\", the tuna salad itself had a little more large chunks of raw lettuce and shredded carrots in it than I cared for but it was still pretty good. They didn't ask what kind of wrap I wanted so I just assumed there was only one kind - it ended up being a whole wheat one which was fine. It made me feel like I made a healthy choice. :) The fries on the side were meh.. they were unsalted and tasteless. 

Wife's salad was ok except she wasn't really a fan of goat cheese. It is quite pungent and more of an acquired taste if you ask me. I would have asked to sub it with something else but to each his/her own.

The kid's Mac and cheese.. Oh my god it was delicious. He didn't finish it as it was a pretty large portion, so naturally I ended up eating most of it. It is a white cheese blend with mushrooms and onions in it. It's absolutely fantastic! Cheesey creamy goodness with the different textures from the onion and mushrooms. I'll have to order this as an entree for myself next time!"}
{"text":"I met two girlfriends for brunch this past Sunday afternoon, and wasn't impressed as I usually am.  The service was not quick or friendly.  The restaurant wasn't clean.  We pointed out a large wet spill next to our table to a girl delivering food,  and she shrugged and said yeah, we know about it.  Several of the tables weren't bussed or wiped down.  The pancakes were okay, but my bacon was burnt.  It won't be my first choice to go back to as there are several other restaurants in the same shopping center.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It was good to have a healthier place to eat. We got a turkey sandwich, fresh fruit and an acai bowl. Coming from Hawaii, I'm use the Acai bowls being like a frozen smootie with fresh fruit and granola on top. This was like a weird pudding with granola. It was not good. Of course it was in the airport so everything was overpriced."}
{"text":"Great spot for a healthy bite to eat! Love their Cobb salads and peanut butter blast smoothies."}
{"text":"Always love it here BUT a Suggestion #BrownRice option all day instead of deep fried everything per the doc who was grumpy this morning"}
{"text":"Never a bad meal at Rachel's Kitchen.  I had a grilled veggie sandwich on a French roll that was tasty and fresh and a vegetable soup with cheddar cheese that was simply out of this world.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Rachels I walk out with a very satisfied feeling.  The food is always tasty, fresh and healthy.  I had a veggie wrap that was just sooooo tasty.  The employees are always friendly.  I especially like eating in their outdoor cafe area."}
{"text":"I love the food here at Rachel's kitchen but the service at this particular location has been consistently unpleasant. I used to visit the hualapia location frequently when I lived on that side of town. Always friendly service and great food. After visiting this location and receiving rude service every time, I've decided not to go back. 
Today my girlfriend decided we should give it one more chance and the same thing again. I really don't understand it. The younger girls that work at this location are smug and rude and impatient and they act like they can't stand you for whatever reason. I am friendly to everybody and to have such rude service at a place you really like sucks. I even tip them 20 percent or more and still the same. If someone is rude to you I can understand a little attitude back but the service here is flat out rude for no reason. It's not everybody either. Just one or two that I am unlucky enough to have to deal with in my experiences here. So for me enough is enough and I have visited this place for the last time."}
{"text":"The staff is always nice and greet you right off the bat. I love coming for the food but mostly for the juices and smoothies. AMAZING! I love it."}
{"text":"Awesome healthy chain restaurant. Great choices and pretty decent coffee. Nice vibe in restaurant and have decent breakfast alcohol choices as well. Menu is great!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas I go here! If you check in before 11 am you get a free muffin! I always order the turkey club, you can't go wrong with this. But I can literally eat anything here it is all so delicious. On top of this the staff is amazing. Right when you walk in they greet you."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh. Ordered the Chicken Caesar Wrap with Sweet Potato Fries and the Acai Berry Smoothie. Food came fast, fries were hot & crispy and the smoothie was very refreshing. Restaurant was clean and quiet. Offer free wifi as well. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"One of my favourite spot in NW for a healthy brunch. 

Food is always fresh and tasty. I love the egg items and the fresh squeezed juices and smoothies.

Staff is always friendly, and the establishment is always clean and refreshing."}
{"text":"Rachel's kitchen is amazing! My friend recommended Rachel's to me and I love It! Vanessa's team is wonderful. Food and service was fantastic as always. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went here for my first time and it was amazing. Vanessa was so helpful with the menu and helping me with gluten free options!!! Defenetly going back."}
{"text":"I was in the Green Valley area and I had always wanted to try Rachel's having walked by many times. I was also lured by a feeling of healthy dishes on the menu.  I was a bit early and not too many people were dining, so I ordered a salad, received a number and sat down.  After 20 minutes of not receiving my salad I approached a Spanish gentleman passing my table and asked if maybe they had forgotten my order. He told me that they were busy getting a catering order out and my salad would be about 10 more minutes.  I told him that I did not have any more time to wait, and asked for a refund which he took are of. I really think they should make diners that are in the restaurant a priority."}
{"text":"I've dined at other Rachel's locations in town, but this was my first visit to this location. I found the staff as friendly and food as good as the other locations.

We arrived around noon and the restaurant wasn't very busy. The employees all greeted us and were ready to take our order. The inside of the restaurant was clean and orderly. As we ate the restaurant grew more busy, but seats are spaced enough that it didn't feel too crowded. 

I had a Chicken Salad Sandwich with sweet potato fries. There were several bread options. The chicken salad was a sweet version of the typical chicken salad with grapes and apples. I liked the flavor. The sweet potato fries were delicious as well. My friend had the Cobb Salad and he loved it."}
{"text":"I love this spot for a healthy meal that doesn't taste like generic healthy food. This location is conveniently located in The District. It's always one of the busiest spots in the shopping center. Good thing they have outdoor seating for nice days as well.

The menu options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all good. They have a wide variety of menu options including sandwiches, salads, burgers, smoothies, wraps, and pasta. My favorites are the Ultimate Grilled Cheese and the Signature Pasta. The Signature Pasta is a sizeable portion, those watching calories could probably make this into two meals. The Ultimate Grilled Cheese is a real treat and comes with yummy French fries. 

The restaurant is inviting and has a variety of seating options including tables, booths, and outdoor seating. Pricing is very reasonable and definitely not expensive for the quality. Food is made to order, but the wait is never too long.

I also love that I can get my husband to eat here. Usually he scoffs at places like this, but the food is even to his liking!"}
{"text":"Sometimes when you're in Vegas, you just don't feel well. Whether you had a rough night, or a completely awesome night, you need to come to this place to get some of the best, healthiest, yum food stuff around Fremont Street. There's really not much to choose from in this area - gross casino buffets, taco stands, pizza, or the ridiculous restaurant where you eat for free if you are morbidly obese. If you happen to like food outside of these categories, you MUST try this place. I was greeted by two women who I assume own the place, and was almost thrown off by how nice they were. They were literally so accommodating and knew everything about every item on the menu. They served my friends and I all with a smile, and that was something I did not expect. The food took a little bit longer than they expected, so they gave us free cookies! The food: SO GOOD. Everything was fresh, well prepared, and looked great on the plate."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but the food was very bland tasting.  It tasted like they didn't add any salt, pepper, or any other seasoning.   My brother and I had to pour hot sauce on our food so it had some flavor.   Disappointing when you go out to eat and could have made something better at home."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I like how you can order online and pick it up or you can eat in the restaurant. The sweet potato fries are bomb."}
{"text":"I was really sad when Daily Kitchen, through some nefarious lease issues, unseated Rachel's Kitchen and made them move to DI.  Their location at DI is next to a smoke shop and I dont need that kind of second hand action.  I love that this location is so near my house.  I love everything from a tasty BBQ burger to the bacon muffins.  I am glad they are also opening in my secondary hood. . . Downtown.  So now I can eat a little healthy when I am enjoying the hacker space."}
{"text":"I like that they are cheap wholesome food.

I really love the Parmesan Scone and Bacon Muffin.  They also have really amazing salads( I like Chinese chicken and pear the best).  I also like the multi grain pancake."}
{"text":"Came here for the juice. Trying to eat healthily for breakfast and lunch so I can be glutinous for dinner. Staff is exception. Max j. Helped me this morning. He was very polite and friendly. Great worker. Now I'm back for lunch. 
The juice is not too pricey.
6.50- 7.50$ 16-24 ounces. Glad I could walk here from the gold nugget. 

The sandwiches and pasta looks fantastic. Dying to come back for club sandwich. 
The pasta also looked bueno. 

I made a note of their vegan options cause sometimes I don't feel like eating meat. When we come back in a few months I'll explore the menu further."}
{"text":"Pretty good place, took my mom out for breakfast. They offer vegan and gluten free options. I had an omelet with was a bit over cooked which threw me off a lot. Mom had the favorite with gluten free toast and had an energizer juice. She was pleased."}
{"text":"The menu had a variety of items that I'd like to try I had the turkey club on wheat. The bread did get a little soggy by the time I got to my second half but still a good sandwich. All in all a good lunch spot."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty hard reviewer, so I'm giving them only three stars, but if I was to grade like most of the peeps in LV it would be four.  I like my food heavy so its almost always the pasta and its always yummy...but its also pricey and nothing \"special\".  I've gotten their smoothies and same thing.  Tasty, decent, nothing spectacular, but also pricy for me. So unfortunately that's why it gets only three stars.  Otherwise service is good, ain't got no beef with nothing else."}
{"text":"I wanted to really like Rachel's kitchen after my hospital coworkers rave about it. So tonight prior to work I stopped in for dinner. I order Mac and cheese and a sunrise smoothie. The smoothie was very good and tasted fresh. The Mac and cheese was a disappointment. The taste was spot on but the noodles were undercooked and gummy. I like the atmosphere and will visit agin I just won't order the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I don't really understand the hype over Rachels. It is walking distance from my house which I enjoy but the food is pretty basic. I could easily save some money and just cook at home. My friends like to come here for brunch so that's the main reason why I eat here. Overpriced for what you get. Three stars for the convenience of a breakfast place near me."}
{"text":"Mochas taste like water. Breakfast burritos are cold and bland, no flavor. And service is bad, go to Dennys."}
{"text":"Rachel's is the best place for a healthy lunch. Especially on a nice day where you can sit outside on the patio. Today Dakota was working and gave great customer service."}
{"text":"This review is for this location only. I eat at Rachel's Kitchen all the time (different location) and usually order the same thing, chicken Caesar salad. Went to this location and ordered my usual to go. When I went to add the dressing I noticed it looked different. Didn't think much of it. Put my salad together and when I went to eat it I noticed it smelled weird, kind of like bleach. I didn't eat it and threw the whole thing out. I love Rachel's Kitchen but I will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"Good berry mania smoothie ($4.50)  Only thing bad to say about it is the ice cream headache it gives you when you drink it."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent Rachel's Kitchen a couple of times each week because we can count on great customer service and consistency in the awesome quality and freshness of the food. Shout out to Dee who always remembers our juice order and our typical lunch or dinner orders!  She always has a smile on her face and makes us feel special!  We will continue to be regulars here!"}
{"text":"Downtown has become my haven of lunch time and solo time eating. I'm typically by myself during lunch time and I don't cuurrr! I am definitely an independent girl and can have a meal solo so downtown spots are perfect for that. I decided to give Rachel's Kitchen a whirl since I often went to the one in The District in Green Valley. Unfortunately The District got turned into The ROAD o CARS so I have been avoiding that area. I realize Downtown is no different, but The District *used* to have charm... not so much anymore.

Anyway, enough of my ranting - I like the fact this RK is Downtown. I like that it is in The Ogden, what I don't like is me driving past it twice looking for a place to park! *shakes fist* Well, I ended up metering, but I have gotten over that hump of going Downtown. So I meter. I don't care, pretty much every major city EXCEPT Las Vegas has meters everywhere for parking so I have come to terms.

This RK is set up quite the same as the one in The District with the great looking green-tiled tables and the nice snuggly cafe vibe. The employees were very sweet when I was here and offered honey/lemons for my tea and answered my questions regarding the soup of the day.

I really was hankering for soup/sandwich combo which RK has for $9.75. I say that's a decent price especially since you get a bowl of soup, not a cup. 

Turkey/Bacon/Avocado Sandwich (on sourdough) & Potato Cheddar Soup - The soup startled me because when it came out it was bright orange. I was like, \"What is this trickery potato soup?\" But, as I spooned the deliciously pureed potato and cheese into my mouth I decided it was quite delicious. I am sure the orange hue comes from copious amount of cheddar cheese, so ya know, fat girl status up in here! As for the sandwich it was a bit of a let-down. The bread was dry dry dry and did not have the richness I was expecting from a nice sourdough. I have a suspicion it was day(s) old bread. And there was an extra piece of bread in it which I didn't care for and removed. The turkey was all right and in my wold avocados make anything better, so it saved the sandwich a bit but not much.

Peach & Ginger Black Tea - I would come back for their teas to be honest. Sitting downtown sipping this amazing tea they have would be perfect on any winter day. I can't remember the name of the teas but the next time I go back I am writing it down in case I can get it for my own enjoyment at home.

Overall - Food-wise could use a little work. I hope when I go back the next thing I order completely redeems the dry bread. Ambiance, service, and overall experience was positive. Four stars it is for now."}
{"text":"It's official. Rachel's is officially a 5-Star place for me. I've been here now on three occasions and although my reviews before this one were not 5-Stars, I gotta push them up to the 5-Star mark.

Today I had the turkey and avocado sandwich with a side salad and a cup of water. The people working here are genuinely nice and professional at the same time. You can tell they all enjoy working here and are happy to put a lot of work into really good food.

The side salad is perfect in my opinion. Greens are crispy, dressing is perfectly portioned and tangy, AND they serve their salads wish sliced radishes! Who does that?! I hardly ever see anyone put radishes on salads! The sandwich was yummy too.

Menu is awesome and offers something for everyone. I will say I think it is a bit on the pricey side, BUT you are in The District. 

Honestly I just love Rachel's Kitchen and the next time I go I am trying one of the salads or the pastas!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've ever had! The southwest turkey sandwich with sweet potato fries is my new go to for lunch. Absolutely amazing! Whatever chipotle aioli sauce they put on there is great for the fries too. They also have an arrangement of fresh pressed juices as well. I love a good carrot juice!"}
{"text":"This is going to be my number one place to eat a healthy and wholesome breakfast in Henderson, NV,Rachel Kitchen is in The District which is a shopping center,there was a lot of work going on in the area,so it was like a maze getting her kitchen,you know you are there by the cute patio in front of the building,the place is not that large but a nice size to enjoy your meal,the staff was very friendly and helpful with our order,I had the french toast,with fruits and a side order of turkey becon and a cup of O/J,wife had pancakes with fruits,becon and a cup of watermelon juice,she said it was soooo good,the decor is pretty cool,there is one TV on the wall,I think there may be two restroom here,but I used the one of the left which the sign says male/ female only a stool ( so mens don't for get to lift and lower the lid) Oh they also have gluten free food,cleansing juice,protein and smoothies,burgers,warps,pasta,and salads,definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First time trying out this place. The staff was friendly and prompt in taking our order. 
I opted for the signature past and popeye's secret fresh squeezed juice. 
The place is clean and plenty of tables available.
From the Main Street, it's not easy to see if you have never been here. I used my gps since this is our 1st time.
Bonus - free blueberry muffin with Yelp check-in.
The food : excellent. Fresh and excellent taste."}
{"text":"Best turkey burger I have ever had! You can tell that they freshly grind the meat and form the patties, not frozen over seasoned patties I've gotten from most restaurants! I also got Popeyes Secret, also amazing."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is my daily lunch spot in DTLV. I order off the menu everyday and it never bothers the staff. You can't ask for any better than that. I usually hit them with the Gluten Free pasta tossed in olive oil, add peas, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes and chicken. No matter how busy they get during the lunch rush they always take special care of me. I'm pretty sure they'd to the same for all their customers so don't miss the Rachel's experience. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Cobb salad is my favorite! They are always busy thats how good their food is. What is way cool is going through their website order and pay and the pickup is quick."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Great food. Huge menu!  Friendly staff. Lots of healthy choices."}
{"text":"I like this place. They have a good menu and the prices and portions are not bad for downtown. Curry chicken wrap is one of my favorites. The salads are good and good sized. Staff is nice and wait is usually not too bad. Place feels a little crowded but nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  Expensive, yes, but amazing!  Let's just say you get what you pay for.  The restaurant is set up perfectly for lunch.  You order your food first, and pick a table.  They bring the food out.  We had the argula and pear salad, chicken mushroom swiss sandwich with sweet potato fries, and the kid's mac and cheese.  Our kids split the mac and cheese, and we still ended up eating it with them.  It was all so fresh and flavorful.  We will definitely be back for happy hour or one of their daily specials."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Stopped in for sandwiches and didn't disappoint. Will be back to try other stuff. Happy it's close to home"}
{"text":"I love Rachel's Kitchen because it's easy to be healthy here! A great example of this is when my husband tried to replicate a Denver Omelet and he asked for ham. The guy behind the counter said they don't carry ham so he chose turkey instead. My husband said it was still good! 

Roberto's Breakfast Burrito has been knocked out of first place in my book and replaced with Rachel's version! It had egg whites, avocado, salsa and Swiss cheese. It was light but not on taste the flavors came together to create a very crave worthy burrito! Yum!"}
{"text":"I went to Rachel's kitchen for the first time today after searching for some healthy options near my house. It was a bit hard to find simply because I didn't realize it was in the Hilton, and my maps didn't tell me either. Once I realized, I parked at the Hilton and it was easy to find. I ordered the grilled vegetable and chicken salad. It's similar to one they have at CPK, but cheaper. Still very delicious and the vegetables were all fresh, and the chicken had good flavor as well. Would probably try it with ranch next time simply based on preference, but the balsamic was super good! My boyfriend got the chicken Caesar wrap with regular fries. The fries weren't salted but I think that's probably intentional, however they were also luke warm. Not a big deal, fries are still fries. The wrap was fairly decent, good flavor but a tad soggy because the tortilla soaked up the dressing. I also ordered an iced vanilla latte and it was delicious! Way better than Starbucks. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other options and I'm glad to have a good healthy spot so close to me."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot, because the food is healthy; even though it's pricey. Lately, I have not been coming here, because the food has been taking a long time to come out when dining in. It took 25 minutes tonight just for the 440 sandwich (lettuce wrap) and they were not busy. It's bad just waiting for my food to come out, and then one of the workers came up to me asked if I had ordered the 440 sandwich wrap. I said yes, they said there's no more lettuce to make a wrap if they could use chopped lettuce. I said you don't have soup, because I tried ordering and  now you do not have lettuce. I said yes for the chopped lettuce. When my food came out they served a lot of hard lettuce which was cut up. My dinner was awful I was so unhappy that I am not coming to this location anymore. This location sucks and to put more salt in my wound. The employees were screwing around in the back. I could hear them talking and giggling. Apparently, they don't care about the customer(s)."}
{"text":"First of all I love that this location is open 7 days a week. This is one of the larger locations compared to some of the others in the valley. As far as selection they all are the same and consistent. You can find sandwiches, salads and soups along with breakfast items. It's really nice that you have the option to select your bread for your sandwich. They also have smoothies and freshly squeezed fruit drinks. 
My go to is the Rachel's chicken salad sandwich  on ciabatta and watermelon water. If you check in with the purchase of an entree you get a glass of wine so that's a bonus. The price is reasonable for the quality of food you're getting. 

I believe I read that they do bottomless mimosas for ~$11, so I'll def have to come back and try it out. 

Great place for the family!"}
{"text":"Rachel's s a great alternative for healthy foods and fresh juices and smoothies. Staff is always friendly and very prompt."}
{"text":"I was hoping for more. Rachel's Kitchen wasn't good, wasn't horrible......
I had the cob salad and my husband had a burger....... both were okay.... not bad, but definitely nothing special.
Doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"Not sure if I want to give it them 2 or 3 stars.  Last week they did a great job delivering lunch to our office.  Food was fresh, warm and quite good.  Today's delivery seemed to be slow, but on top of that my meal was COLD!  So disappointing because I know they could do better.  My food was so cold that the onion in my union ring was cold.  They forget to bring 1/2 of our order and it was it took over 2 hours to get to us."}
{"text":"Overpriced and average. Sure I really could sum up this restaurant with just those words and that is pathetic! I mean what happened to the niche market of little mom and pops places where you could get great food at a decent price? Now we are stuck with places like this flooding the market charging outrageous amounts for food that isn't even good forget getting something great. I mean literally this is like trash on a plate it sucks I have no other words to explain biting into a big lump of nothing then you look at you bill and wonder just what the heck you paid for! Stay very far away from this place you never know if you get too close to the restaurant they might just charge you for breathing the air around it or something I mean dang this place was just super pricey I'm still stunned by just how bad it was."}
{"text":"The curry chicken wrap was really good! Everything tatsted fresh ill be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few different times and had a little bit of everything. Of all dishes definitely stop in for the pasta, I've had every one on the list and they're all amazing. Garden pasta and the Mac and cheese are my favorites. Burgers and sandwhiches are mediocre. About the same as you would get almost anywhere else. Everytime I go I get a water melon juice, always fresh and definitely tasty.

They're good for to-go too. I feel like it's always the same guy I talk to when I call in to order and he's so friendly! Parking situation is a little annoying, try not to come during a busy time or you're stuck parking closer to the animal hospital and walking, not bad but not ideal."}
{"text":"Located at the airport in Las Vegas, Rache's Kitchen is an excellent choice if you are looking for something healthier, and filling. I like their Acai bowls and usually get them for breakfast when I'm in Las Vegas. Delicious! The granola that is mixed in is splendid. It has some pieces in it that are almost like rice cereals that give a nice puffy crunch. The bowl had blended acai, fresh fruit, granola, and chocolate. They also have a variety of Teas, but my personal favorite is the Morrocon Orange Peppermint.

AIRPORT:  LAS"}
{"text":"All the dishes I got with chicken in it was extremely dry and overcooked. I can cross this place off my list to eat. I had wanted the pasta but at the time of day that I was there it seemed like a bad choice

The environment is nice and the service was great. The food was just subpar."}
{"text":"Great chicken Cobb salad and the smoothies are amazing!"}
{"text":"First time here, my friends always snap pictures of there food from here so my girlfriend and I decided  to try it. My girlfriend ordered the chicken tender wrap and I ordered the mac and cheese without mushrooms and onion. Both dishes were really good! The staff was nice and helpful. We will be coming back to try the breakfast next!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here to get a couple of juices and smoothies.  The place was not real crowded when we arrived, our order was taken quickly, however, the drinks took forever.  There were some people who came in after us who seemed to be regulars and they received their items before we received our juice.  Not sure what the issue was with the juice, but this is a place we would go back to, no question....."}
{"text":"Twice in the past week we have been to this place and the juices are AWESOME!!!!  The smoothies are good as well and the food compliments.  It has been a while since we were here before these last two visits and it was great to see they expanded the inside and really made the place look nice.

We have always enjoyed the food here and now with the juices & smoothies, this place is one at the top of the list.  They have great food, great customer service and a place you should try.  

In closing, I have never had a bad experience here and doubt I ever will....A must to your list..."}
{"text":"I wanted to let you know about our experience at Rachel's Kitchen, today. The food was fabulous and we ate outside in the GV District , very pleasant. However, I would have purchased your unique fruit juices, if I could taste one. When asked the employee she said they did not offer samples, too bad. My husband and I would have purchased 2. Not being familiar with your reciepies, samples may increase your sales. I ordered the Cobb Chicken Salad and a pecan dessert, my husband had a lite salad and chicken sandwich including passion teas. Nice day to dine outdoors in the GV district."}
{"text":"I. Love. This. Place.

Whole, healthy and DELISH!!!

You can feel good eating here and I'm not just saying that!

Their juices are bomb at the right price too!! :D"}
{"text":"Am a regular and so is my daughter. Have tried most of the menu & it all is fresh and tasty (as well as healthy). My favorite is signature salad with chicken. They have amazing staff and many repeat customers. Nice to have a neighborhood place to grab a quick bite where the staff remembers me and I see friends quite often."}
{"text":"Juice was really good. Had the watermelon juice. The breakfast sandwich was too cheesy."}
{"text":"Bad day at Rachel's today.  When we walked in on a busy Friday lunch, half the tables were reserved.  We waited while four tables were cleaned to actually get a table.  When I finally got my medium well cheeseburger, it was RAW.  Still waiting for them to correct it.  Doubt it will happen before my meter runs out!!

They did bring us a brownie!!!"}
{"text":"Tried Rachel's kitchen for the first time today since my husband was raving about it. I have to say I wasn't impressed. I had the half sandwich and soup of the day. The soup was supposed to be chicken and rice, but really it was veggie soup with a small amount a of chicken and I couldn't really find the rice. The sandwich was the 404 something and the chicken was over cooked and dry. For the price I felt it wasn't worth it. I wasn't even able to finish the soup since it was mostly a clear broth. Not sure if I will try again."}
{"text":"Ya know, it's NEVER a pleasant experience to get 3 bites into your grilled vegetable sandwich and bite into a broken half of a toothpick....and ya the SHARP END TO!"}
{"text":"I recently met up with an old coworker here for lunch. It was a weekday around noon and there was plenty of open tables and no wait to order. The location is a little bit hidden, it's located on the side of the Ogden building. 

I decided to go with the chicken curry salad. The flavor was great, not too much dressing on the salad and a good even balance of ingredients. The portion size was huge. I couldn't even finish the whole thing. I also loved that they had a few different flavored tea options and fresh juices. 

I'd definitely be back again and love this location since it's pretty central to the entire valley."}
{"text":"Yummy! I had curry chicken salad sandwich with sweet potato fries. It was seasoned right to my taste and of course, I love the flavor of curry. A bonus to this was when I checked in with yelp, I get to have a free pastry.. since I was there around 6pm, there wasn't many to choose from, I end up getting their big fat chocolate chip cookie which was delicious. I went to the gym a couple hours later to burn off that fat cookie that I ate! 

I want to come back and try other things there at an earlier time."}
{"text":"Very likeable small chain that features fresh ingredients, delightful variety and stellar service. Have been here to drink coffee while watching a salad (with salmon substituted) enjoyed and devoured. Think of the new kinds of fare Starbucks is offering, now imagine a real kitchen making a lot of this happen --- plus a larger range of items. Breakfast is served all day, and people looked happy the couple times I showed up. Good place for parents of younger ones, or just people needing a quick bite that won't cost an arm and a leg. Yes, it's reasonably priced. While there is table service, per se, you do have servers bring your food, after ordering it from the counter. Tip at time of purchase, or as you leave. 

The bakery stuff looked great --- yogurt parfaits, muffins, cakes, et al. The first day I showed up, there were lemon poppyseed muffins that looked perfect. However, the next day, when I came back, they looked just OK. They were smaller and didn't look as big and vigorous. The server told me that they had a different chef today --- and I was glad to hear that at least there is some human touch to all this. She either took pity on me, or perhaps the smallish muffins themselves, and stuffed a second one in my bag, without me even knowing. Very sweet. I, um, should really go back to that tip jar and make an adjustment.

Located in a mini strip with a Curves, a Nutrition Blast, a pet care store, Nail salon --- this place looks well-suited here. And the food is darn good, too."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, and awesome. Lots of gluten free options and the fresh squeezed juice and smoothies are phenomenal. I've been here several times and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"We love Rachel's Kitchen! Peanut butter smoothie thing is crazy addictive and perfect on a hot Vegas day.  I get the protein scramble // large portion and lots of goodies like bacon and chicken and the salsa is super yum! I also love the grilled cheese // I get this on gluten free bread and add bacon and turkey (BACON!) 

This is a really cute spot to grab a healthier breakfast or lunch... If you eat inside, the cafe style/feel is nice and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"For breakfast..

Overpriced & average average average!!! 

Omelette, bacon & coffee $15.67 

Would have sooooo been better from an ordinary diner."}
{"text":"Rachel's kitchen is a little cafe in Summerlin near the I-215 on S Towncenter Dr. It is not very big at all.

The dining area has about 10 small tables maybe. There is a counter where you order your food and then the server brings it to you. They also offer seating outside. I always get the chicken sandwich and a salad. They have plenty healthy items on the menu to choose from. That's why I like this place. They have good burgers too.

If you want a healthy quick lunch, stop in here."}
{"text":"Yummy and fresh. I had a grilled veggie sandwich with goat cheese on a ciabatta roll. It was delicious and filling. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Rachel's Kitchen out of all the other locations. Their food is always on point, their juices are always good. Their food is consistently good (the other locations - not so much). I go here weekly and love it. The food is very fresh and the staff is fantastic! Once of my favorite places for lunch for sure!"}
{"text":"Hubs is running the Revel marathon tomorrow- needed to eat well/ light- popped into Rachel's for chicken Caesar wraps and acai bowls - Wraps were generous and tasty - served with sweet potatoes fries - plus!!!
They need more fruit and lees granola in their acai ... just sayin ... Service was kind and quick - happy belly!!!"}
{"text":"One of my usual spots I go too when I'm feeling like eating a little healthy. 

Environment: this place is located in the beautiful district. The restaurant itself is opening seating outside and inside. The ceiling is really high up and gives a very open feeling with the large windows. Most people who come here look like are coming from work, working out, or bringing their kids from school.

Service: the staff are all very friendly. You order at the register and get a number. They bring out the food and drinks pretty quickly. 

Food and drinks: there are sooo many options here. You can get wine, coffee, mimosas, and smoothies. Their food menu is also very extensive from pasta to brunch foods to sandwiches and wraps. All of these options are delicious though and the entrees are decently sized so you are never too full and never hungry.

Overall, I enjoy coming here for lunch on the weekends to enjoy the district area with some healthy and fresh drinks and food."}
{"text":"So far pretty good! I had the angel hair bolognese & Fresh Berry Chicken salad... so fresh tasting! Place is clean, friendly & great tasting!"}
{"text":"After a very late dinner prior eating at In N Out, and a long drive to northern Arizona ahead of us, we wanted a hefty and healthy late lunch before the trip. We were leaving Fremont Street and I Yelped for some healthy lunch options and Rachel's Kitchen was nearby and highly rated.

I ordered the tuna salad, a cup of coffee, and my bf had the salad with the grilled chicken. 

Our salads were YUGE and insanely delicious. The would have been much more pricey in NYC. Definitely one of the better meals out here during our trip! The place has a complete downtown/financial district lunch vibe, but wasn't too insane when we went. Definitely kept us happy and healthy for the long haul!"}
{"text":"It was a good spot for lunch. Nothing stood out as being spectacular but everything is good. If you're in the area and need a solid bite to eat, you should absolutely stop by this place. It won't do you wrong!"}
{"text":"Quality food with great service and a fun, clean environment! They have delicious fresh squeezed juices and smoothies! If you are looking for something light to eat I recommend the Arugula Pear salad, it's my favorite dish. This location is by far my favorite. The staff is extremely helpful and kind. Wonderful store manager by the name of Vince. Great brunch place!"}
{"text":"Generally they are pretty good but this last time I went here for a pick up order they made two small smoothies when I ordered two large smoothies, and completely forgot to make the other one..."}
{"text":"Rachael's is a wonderful place to meet a friend for lunch or an afternoon glass of wine.  Most of the year, it is very enjoyable to sit outside and enjoy The District, although since they added the street down the middle where you can drive and park, I am not sure how that has affected the ambiance of sitting outside.  They have lots of healthy and delicious choices on the menu and I always feel good about the food I eat when I am here.

One of my favorites is their thai chicken salad."}
{"text":"The curry chicken salad is amazing.  Very good place for late lunch.  Was going to have the chopped salad but broccoli is the only green."}
{"text":"This was such a lovely spot. Located on the side of Hilton garden inn. You can enter through the hotel or from the outside. My boyfriend and I stopped here for lunch and were delighted. The quite resort feel of the restaurant left us feel relaxed, as if we took a small lunch vacation. If your looking for a small getaway (even if it's just for an hour at lunch) this place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Fresh Fruit Bowl.  Very  Good.  Large OJ.  Very Good.  Fast service.  Decent Price.  Better than Fast Food."}
{"text":"Not only are the prices OUTRAGEOUS, but the staff had zero personality. They messed up on my husbands order and had to take his food back after we waited about 15 minutes before it was served. 

We both ordered chicken wraps, which seems like a relatively easy food to make, but it took a very long time before it came to our table. The server was nice and she was apologetic about the order being messed up, but it was rather frustrating that we had waited so long and now had to send it back.

If I had to give the owner a piece of advice I would say to move the blender to the back of the restaurant. It was right up front next to the order station and we had to repeat everything we said and the guy who took our order would never speak loud enough over the blender so it made for a very confusing ordering experience.

We won't be back - the cost of 2 wraps and 1 shared drink was $25. It was good, but not that good."}
{"text":"Sat here for a business meeting.

The service was good, the food was not that great.

I hot the spaghetti bolonese.
 Not that good.

Probably will come back for coffee"}
{"text":"Service was slow waited for my smoothie for like 20 minutes.
My wife liked her smoothie I didn't like mine at all"}
{"text":"We come here all the time to grab lunch or dinner.  Today we decided on breakfast and were very happy!  Yummy food and $3 mimosas!!  Happy Saturday"}
{"text":"I love the fresh salads that they have here...it's still in semi construction about a month before its really finished...friendly and fast service...great place to meet up with some girlfriends for a light lunch...just glad it's only down the street from me..."}
{"text":"This is a good resource for food, but service is SLOW. Since this is at a hotel- it should be mindful that travelers may need to make flights, etc. I eat here monthly and now realize it is not only the day or the crew- it is their norm. I've sat at my table for 10 min now and no coffee, juice or water. I ordered and paid already. They typically bring the food out and then I remind them of my drinks- every time. Then it takes another 5 for my drinks. Terrible."}
{"text":"I regularly go to Rachel's for breakfast and lunch! Food is always great as well as customer service. Vince and Vanessa always go the extra mile to make sure everything is just right. I highly recommend the breakfast burrito and the chicken Caesar salad wrap"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and overall it is amazing. The BBQ chicken wrap and hulk smoothie are my favorites. It's also a plus that they serve breakfast all day so a late lunch can include pancakes or an omelette. 

The only thing I haven't enjoyed was the sweet greens juice. It was incredibly bitter and made me sad. I usually love green juices but I would not recommend this one. 

This place is definitely worth a try if you've walked past and wondered about the constant line that is often times nearly out the door."}
{"text":"I was struggling with how to describe this place when having lunch here for the first time with coworkers. Eventually I decided that \"bistro\" is the best way to classify this restaurant. A very Summerlin feeling bistro. Hopefully that makes sense for you Vegas residents. If not, then another way to put it is that it's a smaller, bougie version of Panera Bread.

The food was okay. I had the turkey club, which had smoked turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, avocado, romaine lettuce, tomatoes and mayo served on three pieces of sourdough bread. The portion size was good. I like that I had a choice of mixed green salad, french fries, sweet potato fries or onion rings with my sandwich. Whenever sweet potato fries are an option at a restaurant, I go with that.

Food was a bit pricey. $11 plus tax for a turkey club. Because of that fact, Rachel's Kitchen probably won't join my lunch rotation. Not a bad restaurant, but nothing special."}
{"text":"This location is convenient to home for me located within the Hilton Garden Inn. Friendly service and typically the food is decent. This past visit they got everything wrong, although it was rung up correctly on the receipt. Unfortunately by the time I got home and realized the order was wrong, they were closed when I called back. (Closed at 2pm due to the holiday). Very disappointing with the lack of attention to detail.
I'll be back but will be sure to check everything before leaving with a takeout order."}
{"text":"I love the concept of Rachel's Kitchen and the service is always good.
The problem I'm struggling with is that the food is inconsistent and ok at best regarding things I've tried so far.
I enjoy the salads. Love the smoothies and fresh squeezed juices.
Sandwiches have been hit or miss. Sometimes the sammies have been bland and that's a statement for me because I usually feel food is over salted etc.
I've had the plain fries twice and both times haven't been flavorless and cold.
Soups are tasty but it lacks texture. The 4 times I've ordered the soup of the day- it's completely puréed like baby food.
The most disappointing was this evening. I ordered a burger cooked medium. It was dry and over cooked, well done. I love my burgers still a little pink because that's where the flavor is to me. You overcook the meat and you lose the flavor and the juiciness.
So I'm on the fence...."}
{"text":"I ate the Chinese chicken salad today, and the dressing was addictive.  The chicken is cooked really well, and the mix in of cucumbers with the greens and carrots was a refreshing touch that I don't usually see in a Chinese chicken salad.  I also ordered cookies and cupcakes for my business accounts to go- they offer the cupcakes individually and can box cookies together for you, but they do not sell in bulk unless you order ahead of time.  I love the coffee at Rachel's also.  They are decently priced and have a variety of options to please most palates- from juices and smoothies, to breakfast foods ($12 bottomless mimosas on Sunday for brunch), and salads/soups/sandwiches for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Always delivers on tasty, healthier options for lunch. Had the pear arugula salad (chopped walnuts, citrus dressing, bold cheese, thinly sliced pear and arugula) add chicken- yummy! Also ordered the roasted tomato red pepper soup, and it was yummy without feeling like it was made with too much cream. Chunks of red pepper in it. Also really enjoy their coffee- offer vanilla almond milk and other unique, healthier options to cream. Yum!"}
{"text":"\"Best burger ever\" said the person who hadn't eaten in a month. But seriously, this burger was horrible. It had a taste and consistency of meatloaf. The meat was either borderline sour, or it was the seasoning that looked funny. The bun was just over the edge on the left half of the bun(betcha didn't know that there is a left side and a right side to a bun). This after they took my $10.49, which included the $1.75 up charge for fruit, which consisted of 4 red grapes, 2 little pieces of pineapple, 6 pieces of honeydew and and 30 dice sized pieces of watermelon.  And to top it off, my plate sat in the order window for 7 minutes. So the burger was almost cold.

I get people want to have a place that they can \"rave\" about, but this isn't it. I'm likely not their key demographic as that appears to be housewives and teenage women, oh and those that don't seem to get how rude it is to let their children run around screaming at the top of the lungs."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! I wish they'd open one in LA. I was so happy to find this place in the airport, amongst the throngs of greasy and unhealthy food options. Their juice menu is HEALTHY, not that fake healthy that a lot of places offer. I got the sweet greens and it was literally the best kale drink I've ever had. The girl who helped me was super friendly too. Will be back next time I'm in LV!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Ultimate Grilled Cheese with Bacon...I was expecting more honestly.  And the cost...hmmmmm a little over my budget."}
{"text":"Updated: The store contacted me via message here afterwards in January 2018 apologizing and offering to check in with the location to work on the issue. They also offered a gift card. However, I never realized I had a message and missed it. I still think that was very kind of them. 

Great food, but the customer service lacks. Always preorder, walk in after time given and can see our food ready and still always wait at least 15/20 minutes while they do other things that don't need to be done at that moment. By the time we get home our food is always super cold and condensation soaked. Same issue no matter when I go in or how not busy they are. I never mind waiting, but they need to learn how to prioritize and work together. That said, I go back because I LOVE the chopped broccoli salad."}
{"text":"Had a nice omelette which was really good, however their way OVER PRICED, with SMALL PORTIONS. Not sure if I'll be returning."}
{"text":"My friends and I came in around 1/1:30 on a Saturday afternoon after attending the women's march! It wasn't busy at all, only a few tables occupied. You order at the counter & they bring your food to your table. 

Their menu is geared towards being healthy, I think. Lol. I opted for the albacore tuna salad sandwich on wheat bread with sweet potato fries! I wish they toasted the bread first but it was good! The fries were also tasty, very crispy, and I didn't feel as guilty eating them. Haha 

So when the guy delivered my food to the table, he said that it didn't look like they gave me enough fries (& I agree, I know it's a healthy place but you should still give out an appropriate portion size) so he's going to ask them to make me a new batch. I thanked him & appreciated that he would do that. However, he never came back & gave me another order... I didn't ask for it since I thought that would be rude but anyways just wanted him to stick to his word. Lol"}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen has been on my bookmark list for a while. So when I got stuck at the D gates at McCarran and hadn't had anything to eat for hours I thought hey, why not give them a try. 

I was not impressed, not even a little bit. A prepackaged sandwich and a cup of orange juice here was almost $20 and to be honest it wasn't all that. I did eat it...after all I was starving but having to pay out so much for mediocre food left me disappointed, especially after what I've read on Yelp about their other locations. 

If you're stuck at the D gates and are hungry, there are several food choices to choose from. I can assure everyone that after my experience at Rachel's Kitchen, I will take my growing stomach and keep on walking to find someplace else in the terminal to eat. 

Overpriced, blah, boring, and disappointing. 1 Star. I cant give them any less even though I want to."}
{"text":"The turkey club was really good! We ordered fries with it, not bad. Also ordered the Peach Berry Smoothie which was so tasty! And it didn't contain banana (which I hate) so that was an added bonus! Over all really good food, healthy menu selections, they serve breakfast all day (which is a must for Vegas considering you never know when breakfast time might be for you!) vitamin water on their soda fountain, and outdoor patio seating. Will go again!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times, everything is super yummy! Have tried salads, sandwiches and smoothies all delicious. Awesome and friendly service all the time. Really glad this place is close by."}
{"text":"For the service I get, this place is super overpriced for food that I can get at panera much cheaper. Also, who closes at 8pm??? Especially in Vegas when most people work late!"}
{"text":"Great place....good environment, variety of food and delicious food! My kids love this place. I can get the tasty food that I enjoy and my kids can get their favorite penitentiary butter and jelly. This place is perfect for family. Business meetings. You name it, I am pleased!!!!"}
{"text":"Rachel's kitchen at trailwood is the ONLY Rachel's I'll ever go to. The food is ALWAYS delicious and made hot, never a wait, and one of the most important things is that the customer service is AWESOME! The whole team is always cheerful and sweet. Sebastian, Iris, Melanie and our favorite Yami. 

We look forward to seeing Yami when we visit.  Most of the time she's our waitress and She is always so helpful and will go out of her way to make sure we are happy. 

Rachel's is definitely one of my favorite places to go to for a fast delicious heathy meals. Thank you all for your hard work! :)"}
{"text":"Shout out to Rachel's Kitchen, for amazing service and the most friendly accommodating staff! Hospital staff discount is appreciated! And thanks for making delicious smoothies"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch all of the time and I never have any issues with my food. I haven't dined in yet but the staff that I have encountered has been helpful and kind."}
{"text":"The food was okay, not on my list of favorites. The cost was pretty pricey for the amount of food that you get but I guess it's because it's right in the heart of downtown Vegas. The staff was friendly enough and recommended the pasta and Mac & cheese so that's exactly what we got. I ordered the watermelon juice to drink and the Mac and cheese with added chicken for my meal. 

The watermelon juice was warm when it came out, had to add ice cubes to it. Warm watermelon juice? Not good. The Mac and cheese was very small. I'm not a big eater at all but I ate up what they served and was still hungry. My fiancé got the angel hair bolognese and a smoothie and the bill came out to $40. Pretty pricey for a small meal. I tried my fiancé's bolognese and it wasn't anything special. Honestly feel like I could've cooked that meal better myself. I'll save myself the trip and the money next time around."}
{"text":"I just ordered the omelette at the location located in the Hilton Garden Inn in Henderson. It was way over-cooked (high heat) and I only received a few diced potatoes and one slice of toast.  For $10, your'e better off going to the International House of Pancakes just a 1/2 block down the road.  The Quality & Value at Rachel's is not there.  The menu is very limited as well. This restaurant is a three star rating at best and not the four stars as currently posted."}
{"text":"I recently stopped in for lunch with a few co-workers. After browsing the menu for a moment we ordered two Chinese chicken salads and one chopped salad. 

Close to twenty minutes later the Chinese chicken salads came out, but I was informed at that time that they were out of the chopped salad. I had a difficult time understanding why it took nearly twenty minutes of waiting to be told this? Moreover, my co workers got their food and I was left to figure out something else to order. 

Rushed, I hurriedly decided on an alternative, chicken salad with no chicken. 

The salad itself was OK, nothing to write home about but also not horrible. Speed of service as far as how long it takes to get food out could definitely improve. Prices are a bit high. 

All in all, this is an OK spot which is why it has earned my 3 star, \"meh\" review. Everything could have been much better but it also was not horrible."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for the first time and will never go back. I ordered the chicken curry wrap with onions rings and the chicken finger wrap with fries. I also ordered two smoothies. Total for those four items came to $34. I then left a $6 tip. After I paid, the girl at the register was very rude. She made the smoothies and nodded at me rather than carrying them to my table where I sat waiting for the remaining items. For $6 dollars, I served myself.... When I finally got the food, there were only 4, seriously FOUR onion rings with the wrap and handful of fries. I'm talking about less fries than a small fry at McDonalds.... Please see attached photos. Terrible value for the price paid. I won't be back... Ever...."}
{"text":"Ok, so we love this place, and get delivery at least 2-3 times a week to our office for lunch. Their fresh juices are to die for, salads are stellar, burgers are awesome, pasta is killer, no paninis unfortunately, only cold sandwiches. Why the 3 stars - just found out that their meat ingredients are generic store quality and NOT antibiotic/ hormone/ GMO free which should be the standard at healthy place to eat. Who knows what's in the meat or even veggies, scary thought, wonder why I didn't think of it sooner, just assumed they were using the best ingredients NOT. Hope they are reading and will take action!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and fresh. No lines at 11 am on a Thursday. My omelette was good but a little bit over cooked and dry. It was still ok so I didn't make a big deal out of it. What was the MAJOR issue. When someone ordered any fresh veggie juice the machine they used made the entire place roar like a construction zone with a jack hammer. It was really overwhelming and the table next to us said the same thing. Very upscale clientele and a very good experience sans the noise. I'm sure they sell a machine that performs the same at half the decibels."}
{"text":"We were in the area at REI and dropped into Rachel's for a light lunch. I ordered the Chicken Curry Salad and the BF got the Acai Bowl w/ peanut butter (it's our weakness)! Both of those hit the spot! Even better, we got a free glass of wine for checking in! I didn't want the food or wine to be over!"}
{"text":"Love love love Rachel's. Always so fresh & tasty (every meal and juice I have ever ordered has been terrific). Restaurant is aesthetically pleasing and clean, staff is very friendly. I only have one request: PLEASE CONSIDER ADDING A LOCATION CLOSER TO LAKE LAS VEGAS! We are dying over here for good restaurants without having to drive 10 miles for a decent meal and without breaking the bank.(hint: The new Cadence shopping center going in where flagship Smith's is being built would be ideal!!)."}
{"text":"This place has a fresh look and fresh ingredients. I tried the breakfast sandwich since it was on special for the day. It came with small fried potatoes. The sandwich itself was good, but it was missing something. It would've been much better with some sort of sauce like an aioli. Otherwise the food came very quickly and it was hot and fresh. The ciabatta  bread was soft, and the avocado was fresh and green. There is an airy outdoor patio, with ceiling fans and music playing. They serve breakfast all day. This is a nice breakfast/ lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Just OK but overpriced.  Had the protein scramble which was yummy but potatoes and toast were not special compared to other local breakfast chains in town.  Sweet greens juice was good but small juice was 16 oz;  8 oz is sufficient and would help cut down price.  Another disturbing thing is that although it touts itself as a \"health conscious\" restaurant, only about 15 items on the menu have nutrition information.  This makes me wonder about the other food items and how healthy they may or may not be."}
{"text":"Only reviewing my available bowl. Acai bowl was okay. Kind of goopy and too much granola w the proportion. Gal helping us behind the counter was cool though."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is about this place.  I've been here a few times and each time I leave I say this is the last time I'm coming here. The only reason I've returned is because of lack of options...but this is the last time.The food is over priced and under flavored and the service is poor. The staff doesn't listen to requests but has side conversations with each other rather than paying attention to you the customer. I wouldn't recommend it...nothing special."}
{"text":"Sweet, flavorful and creamy, the smoothies here are the best I've tasted in awhile.  I was feeling a bit exhausted and the Acai smoothie perked me up and was quite refreshing. The young woman who made the drinks was friendly, polite and fast. My boyfriend and I plan to return to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Average quality for the cost, but of course you're paying for the convenience of having a restaurant in your hotel... I went twice. For breakfast I had the goat cheese omelet which was actually really delicious. I love the cheese they selected: creamy and awesome. Eggs perfectly cooked. The potatoes on the side were soggy and cold so I agree with the other reviewer that they might be frozen. I don't expect fresh potatoes... Frozen isn't a problem for me, but they should be cooked thoroughly until hot and crispy. For lunch I got a veggie sandwich on ciabatta and again - it was a soggy mess. The bread was falling apart it was so waterlogged. My advice to the restaurant would be to toast the bread and/ or make sure you dry the vegetables to remove excess water so that doesn't happen."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow. You'd think getting a smoothie would be the quick option, but it takes 15 minutes for some reason to run the blender. (I timed it.) And that's after you wait to order because only one of the four people behind the counter wants to take orders. They were not busy, but I watched them completely lose a guy's order for a burger. Not recommended."}
{"text":"It was one of those days, didn't feel like cooking but also didn't want to have junk food. Husband found this place near us and he ordered takeout. The food was really good, I had the mushroom burger wrapped in lettuce and the kids really enjoyed their wraps with fries. This is a must if you want quality food and you want it fast."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service! The manager checked in with our group to ask about our experience! Love it! No Apple pay = sad face"}
{"text":"I come here often to have lunch during work.  This place is very consistent as far as service and food quality. I am in love with the bacon avocado turkey. I haven't tried anything else and I come here regularly. (That is how good it is!) Usually I order online which is so convenient, and reliable. The associates greet you with a smile and are alway helpful with the menu options. Believe it or not the onion rings are really good here.... Very fresh and crispy. The seating area is Cafe style and very clean. Take your friend to lunch here!"}
{"text":"French toast is pretty awesome!  Nice variety of coffee... Always well-stocked and piping hot :)   The rest of the menu is OK, I don't love it but all of my friends seem to like it a lot (for whatever that's worth).  I do like that they use fresh, good quality ingredients in their food!  I'm not thrilled about ordering at the counter, but employees are all very friendly and do bring the food to your table.  They serve mimosas in the morning... if that's your thing, it's a cool place to go."}
{"text":"I'm always walking around The District after eating out at a different restaurant and I finally got to try this place. I looked up the menu and also went through a few pictures and reviews on Yelp to see what people liked/disliked. 

I got the same item both times I've been here - BBQ chicken wrap and it's been terrific both times. You get to pick a side so I got French fries. One time I came for a açaí berry smoothie which was $6 for the smaller size but it was definitely worth it. I would come here for this smoothie every chance I get. The second time I saw that if I checked in online I could get a free wine so I got a mimosa! 

There's both indoor and outdoor seating and lots of different healthy food options and drinks. I can't wait to be back and try a pasta!"}
{"text":"Listen, I love whomever Rachel is and the food from her kitchen. I've never ordered something that I didn't enjoy. 

That being said, I also do not like leaving negative reviews unless they are helpful. So hopefully this is.

I have now had three separate instances where the customer service I've received has been horrible. I'm not one to ever ask for anything for free, but when you forget the chicken on a to-go salad order, (when actually ordering extra chicken) then take the time to call once you're home and notice, and still they are just like \"sorry, you can come back\", it's really frustrating. This isn't the first time I've had sub par customer service from them, and it's just really sad, as it makes me not want to come back.

There's a saying, \"people will forget what you said, but never how you made them feel.\" This location of Rachel's Kitchen made me (a frequent customer) feel like my dollar is all they want from me.

I'm sure I will venture into this location again out of necessity, but dang-- we live in Las Vegas-- customer service is everything."}
{"text":"love this place! one of the few restaurants in town with food that i'm not having second thoughts feeding my child. good food, good service."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot.  I had \"The Favorite\".  Three eggs scrambled with goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, avocado, mushrooms and basil.  I remember hearing the tune of \"These are a few of my favorite things\" running in my head as I read the menu.  It was excellent, I had a great experience.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yikes! Went to Rachel's Kitchen and wasn't to happy. Ordered the cheeseburger meal for the husband and a friend, one got the salad ,other got it w fries. The bun was slightly burned and the meat tasted so processed! Husband was not even able to finish the burger as it reminded him of those Bar S frozen burgers he had in college when on a very tight budget. \"Yes,it was gross he said!\" followed by is complaint that he didn't get that many fries. Husband added, \"My smoothie (Hawaiian Bliss)was good though. It was,  I had a sip of it . Next, Friend weighed in with his opinion saying,\" yeah it wasn't that great and he won't be going there again.\" Ok, finally my salad, Grilled Vegetable & Chicken the presentation was very nice, however the  grilled chicken was so dry, I literally almost choked right there in the restaurant. I wish this place had not disappointed me so bad, but it did. I will say the staff was friendly however, we will not be returning :(."}
{"text":"I have been to Rachel's Kitchen twice and I have yet to be disappointed. The first time I went, I had a Smoked Turkey and Avocado sandwich and it was pretty good. It wasn't my favorite sandwich ever, but the ingredients were very fresh. I loved my Hawaiian Bliss smoothie though. I'm a fan of different textures in my drinks, so the coconut in my smoothie was great. The second time I went to Rachel's, I had their Granola with Yogurt and Fruit. It was delicious! I highly recommend this if you're a granola fan. I definitely plan on stopping by again to try more of their menu items."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is always a fave! Great food with lots of healthy options! We're in the healthcare business and when we have meetings, their food is a preferred choice. Chinese chicken salad is a personal favorite"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places! The location is great and the patio is perfect for a quiet little date. The staff is very helpful and patient. I found the food really tasty and they have plenty of healthy items on their menu."}
{"text":"Very casual atmosphere with a good, eclectic menu. The homemade soup was fabulous. My burger bun was a little chilly or the rating would be higher. But it's a definite place to go back to."}
{"text":"Fantastic gluten free bread options and service. I had a fabulous turkey club and my wife had a sinfully delicious gluten free grilled cheese sandwich with turkey. Both served with sweet potato fries. 

Equally important as the food was the service. Catherine helped two handicapped people in wheelchairs who were apprehensive about eating here. She made them feel welcome and ensured they could done in comfort. We were touched and impressed by her compassion."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Places like this were fairly common in LA, but in Vegas they are hard to find. Good, health-conscious food. I had the chicken salad sandwich and she had something with goat cheese and roasted red peppers. Both were great. Wish they had fresh lemonade but I won't take a star for that. But seriously, we need a good arnold palmer to go with lunch."}
{"text":"My friend and I ramdomly picked  this place for breakfast the other morning. There were so many choices that I stuck with something simple and got granola with yogurt and fruit while my friend opted for an egg white and spinach wrap. I was surprised by the portion of yogurt and granola definitely couldn't eat that much in one sitting, but it was awesome especially since they use nonfat greek yogurt and the granola had raisins, cranberries and currants yum!!! The wrap also looked pretty good and my friend definitely seemed to enjoy it though she suggested they could've have put a little less tomato since it was so hot that juice was running out every time she took a bite. I would definitely have to make a plan to go for lunch. Until next time yelpers stay eatin and stay full."}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed in this place. My mom was sick so I decided to get her a FRESH salad and this place was close to my house. When I got there, their system was down, so I wasn't able to order for 10 minutes. On top of that, when it was fixed, the woman at the register didn't even bother to tell me. A guy had to come up to take my order. Poor customer service. I ordered the Signature Salad and it already was not worth it with the ridiculous prices, costing at about $8 for a simple salad. Some salads even sold for $12! Basically, they gave me a pre-packaged salad that made my mom throw up. Everything was old and soft and I came in there, looking for something fresh. I went back in, complaining, and they gave me a new complimentary salad. I appreciated that but this place is not worth the time or money. I will never be coming back here again. Ever."}
{"text":"It was our first time there and the food was good. My wife as usual did not get the extras she asked for in her order. She asked for avocado in her wrap and blueberries in her shake and did not get either. We did not complain but did advise the staff when they asked us how our food was. If we go back, we will make sure to check before we start eating."}
{"text":"Amazing.. ordered from grub hub and was at my house in under 20 minutes.  Not only was it healthy but it was the most delicious thing i have eaten.  Got the bbw chicken wrap BLOWN AWAY!.."}
{"text":"We drive by Rachel's all the time and today we decided to stop in. Two smoothies, a tuna sandwich and fries. $22... I don't know what I expected. The menu board does say the tuna sandwich is $9.95... The value is not a $10 sandwich. The smoothies aren't anything to brag about either. Especially considering the ingredients aren't listed on the menu board but rather on the menu at the cashier station. Not convenient. Also, it's 85 degrees and they kept propping the door. It was so warm. Finally, my daughter (5 y/o) was very vocal about how strange it was that the restroom was only for one person so that's probably good info to know! I don't understand the raving reviews.  The place seemed understaffed and overpriced. I don't see us returning."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast sandwich the other day. I had seen it on the specials board before. Though it wasn't their special today, they made it for me anyway. It hit the spot for sure. I love the avocado they add, good luck getting that added to your sandwich at your favorite drive through breakfast spot. Plus you can order online or call in a order. So you can get in and out as quick as any drive through. Great food and wonderful employees with great customer service. What else can you ask for? Also their patio is dog friendly and they even will bring out a water bowl for your four legged family members. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Located in the Green Valley District.

I usually go here in the morning when I want the protein lover's scramble, which consists of egg, spinach and some bacon.

They have chairs seated outside in case you wanted to enjoy some sunlight. The District is a nice place overall.

Checked in and got a free glass of wine. Not sure why people are complaining about a free item."}
{"text":"Haven't really tried anything from this place but their fresh juices (which were great by the way) but my two stars coming from the service and price of this place. If you are in a hurry don't even consider going to this place because they will take at least 20 minutes for you to get a juice/smoothie. The workers there are very slow, even when i see my drink by the kitchen window, they still take more than 5 minutes to give it to you. Only reason why keep coming back to this place because its more convenient for me to buy than to make my own juice. 

Did i mention that this place is also a pricey? I got a regular oatmeal with strawberries and banana for $7! without the tax."}
{"text":"I really really really enjoyed their fresh juice, and I loved that you can get a free muffin with your Yelp check-in, but I have to lower their rating because of the freaking acai bowl I ordered.

Our whole group came in for breakfast and I opted for their green juice and an acai bowl. The green juice came, loved it, everyone loved their juice, they were really good! And then my acai bowl came....

First of all, it was really small. The acai blend was really liquidy and thin. There wasn't all that much of it since the granola they added took up the entire bowl. The granola is gross. Straight up. There was no crunch, no flavor, just chewy oats, and there were a million and one raisins in it. I honestly could barely taste the acai - it tasted just like bananas honestly so they must not have added enough acai. There were some strawberry slices on top but nothing could compensate for the terrible granola. The granola to acai ratio was just insane and why does there need to be so many raisins?! It was a miserable breakfast experience and I had to force myself to swallow each bite.

While the juices I recommend, I was just too disappointed by my acai bowl :("}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to find this great spot while in town for a soccer tournament.  We actually ate their twice during the weekend and loved all of the food we tried. I'm a vegetarian and had lots of options to choose from while my husband (non-vegetarian) and kids were all very happy with their meals. Finding a place that serves fresh, tasty, food is a huge bonus when traveling with a family of 5.  

Super friendly staff.  Interior was clean, bright, and airy...had fun looking at all of the local kids' artwork!  We will definitely be back the next time we're in Vegas...wish we had one closer to home."}
{"text":"ok so just went here again....the food came out fast and fresh but it wasnt what I ordered and since i got it to go i didnt realize it until I got home. However,this salad I got is really good...lol...oh rachels its a love hate relationship....I appreciate the follow up on my first review as it shows a desire to satisfy a customer...shows me a lot...next time try and give me what I ordered..haha...damn good salad..whats it called i wonder? :)...im gonna give you a verbal 3.5 stars for an excellent salad...if you get my order right next time ill bump you to 4 stars"}
{"text":"I adore the food and the wonderful service.

I have been to this location many times. I will surely  be back."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Rachel's kitchen this month; yum! I got the barbecue wrap and it was delicious! We sat outside and I never knew that the District was so pretty. Great staff and great atmosphere, but I would have to say it was a little over priced. It was pretty expensive for one wrap + fruits and a drink."}
{"text":"Not a fan , driven by a few time and finally decided to stop and give it a try. Walked in and kinda feels like a cheap unorganized  Panera Bread , tables scattered all over no privacy when eating and weird. We made our way to the counter to order, the menu and order area is kinda strange lots of options and no clear selection  of what they do best ( all over the place with options). After a few min looking threw I went with what seemed a bit expensive burger and fries and the wife went with a BBQ chicken wrap. We then made our way to our table and waited , and waited , and waited like 15 min ( not a fast food joint but still felt to long). 

The food 
My burger was ok , not great but ok , the fries we good. I got the mushroom burger, it all tasted fresh and ok.

The wife's BBQ wrap was lacking BBQ , as in they forgot to put any BBQ sauce on it. It was literally just some chicken tenders in a wrap. Both her and I were not fans. 

So all in all , it's not good it's not ok, it's an average attempt at a want to be trendy healthy joint. But it's not!!"}
{"text":"Awesome healthy food, and terrific friendly staff! There is a wide variety of healthy food choices and everyone was so friendly. I was visiting from out of town but I will come back if in the area. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"One of my regular morning spots, thanks to the reasonable pricing (for DTLV), great staff, and yummy smoothies and juices."}
{"text":"I took my family to Rachel's Kitchen this morning. We were looking forward to a nice breakfast on the patio. They had been open for 15 minutes but the patio wasn't open so we had to eat inside. It may seem like a small thing but Rachel's Kitchen charges a premium for breakfast food. I feel like the atmosphere should be complete and ready for breakfast service when the doors open. People who work in/own restaurants know front of the house management is key."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The restaurant has a very inviting and relaxing atmosphere which is also highlighted by the great customer service. The açai bowl is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"How can you not love this place. The food is unbelievable, staff is super friendly and the location is really nice and quiet. This place gets super packed during lunch hours though and it sucks that it's a small venue, but apart from that i have no problems with this place. I recommend the breakfast burrito, garden pasta and the smoked turkey and avocado sandwich"}
{"text":"Didn't know it was here. Love it. Liz and Abby were great. They both recommended the garden pasta and it was amazing"}
{"text":"A nicer alternative to starbucks overpriced and overrated coffee. Try the organic coffee."}
{"text":"Very good. Healthy juice and smoothie options. Also food is very fresh. I do believe the price is a little high but I do understand because the ingredients are very fresh. The chicken on my salad had awesome flavor and the goat cheese on top added a great flavor as well. I would compare this place to a panera but more fresh. Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Food is great and their smoothies so delicious!! The prices are a little high, but it is wholesome food. I plan on coming back. I may just pick up a smoothie on my way to work. Staff was nice and helpful explaining the menu.

5/23/14

Ate here again and got the BBQ chicken wrap. The chicken was dry and hard and would hurt my mouth to chew. My husband's fries were soggy. Despite the food being bad the manager made it right by refunding our money and offering us a gift card. The food is usually great. I will stay a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Absolutely unacceptable! If zero was an option....
I ordered a chicken Caesar wrap and split it with my boyfriend. We both got food poisoning. Got sick that night and we are on day 3 now! It is affecting me at work and my day to day life. Now I am chasing my refund. Poor service. Will not be returning. Its a shame because I thought this might be my new go to."}
{"text":"The food is decent. The staff are friendly. The red wine, however, is ... only served cold at Rachel's Kitchen. 

We checked in to receive a free glass of wine. We chose pinot noir, and I was handed a cold glass. 
When we asked if they had any room temp bottles, the manager's response was, \"all of our alcoholic beverages are served cold. We do not serve anything room temp.\" 

Interesting. 

So we got a plastic cup to warm the wine. Definitely a first."}
{"text":"TIP: If you don't want to wait the 10 minutes it may take to prepare your food/drink, order online ahead of time.

This Rachel's Kitchen is much bigger than the one on Hualapi (Spring Valley). My co-worker and I went there around 3:00pm so the place was pretty empty. I ordered my usual Sweet Greens and an oatmeal cookie, and my friend got the Peanut Butter Blast Smoothie. Man, his drink looked good, but I'm limiting my dairy intake. I decided on doing a juice fast every Tuesday, so I'll be back here once a week. I hope that sometime in the future, they will consider using dairy alternatives for their smoothies."}
{"text":"Hey, I finally found a place to go to when I too lazy to use the juicer! They make their greens juice (Sweet Greens), the same way I do. Five and a half bucks for a large juice - I think that's reasonable for the convenience of not having to make it yourself. I rate this place 4 stars on the juices and drinks, (not to mention that the drinks here are a couple of bucks cheaper than the \"other juice place\" on Flamingo and 215).

We had breakfast here once. I ordered a breakfast wrap, and V ordered the breakfast burrito. Hmmm... they both looked the same to me, but the breakfast wrap costs 50 cents more. Both tasted a little on the plain side, like it needed more seasoning or something. Breakfast potatoes were nice and crispy. 

This place always seems crowded no matter what time of day I go, but the service was ok, nothing to complain about. The other plus is that it's only a 3 blocks from where I live. I'd come here again to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"I really want to give Rachel's more stars, but after giving them many chances I have to sadly say that we won't be returning again.  Every time we come here they are super slow and there is no one in the restaurant.  The last time we called in an order thinking that may help the wait, and it was completely wrong.  They remade the grilled cheese and it took a super long time just to get it.  It shouldn't have been that hard to make a grilled cheese.  All of the food that we have tried has been good and fresh, but it's just not worth the hassle.  For the price and how long it takes we can go to a number of nice sit down places in the area and get excellent service."}
{"text":"Just don't ask for orange juice.It will run you over $5 for a plastic cup."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to remove stars for this recent visit to Rachel's Kitchen. I came in, ordered something to go, and it was taking a long time for it to come out to me. I asked about it 30 minutes later and found out it was just sitting there at the pick up sign...no one bothered to tell me the food had been ready for who knows how long. THEN when I brought it back to school IT WAS THE WRONG DISH. I really like the food here, but I am definitely going to wait a while before coming back."}
{"text":"Happy to have found a healthier meal option right in our neighborhood.  Rachel's Kitchen offers fresh sandwiches, burgers, wraps, pastas, salads, and smoothies.  You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table.  There are a couple tables inside and some more outside.  We've only been once but the sandwiches my hubby and I ordered were fresh and delicious.  We look forward to going back for some more."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place since my last visit out to Henderson, and let me tell you...it exceeded my expectations. Their fettuccini Alfredo was sooo good. It came with mushrooms and spinach. The sauce was super fresh and the spinach was perfectly wilted into the cream sauce. Their Chardonnay was a good pairing with the pasta. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant;  eat in or take out place.
The Signature Pasta has become one of my Favorites along with the french toast and the aragula pear salad. 
The Service is amazing as well Adriana and her staff are very friendly and welcoming.
I truly feel at home eating here.
Thank you guys! You are the best...keep up the good service and food."}
{"text":"Wow!
Food Quality - Perfect
Ambiance - Great considering it seems low key, but it works.
Serving Size - Just right
Healthy - Has some really healthy stuff and some not so healthy.

Overall - I like the food choice, the quality, the health choices. I think it will be a great place to continue to go and if you have pets, you can bring your pet and eat out side. Cannot beat that!"}
{"text":"Great place! Come here all the time we love it. Awesome food and drink options and great service with an awesome staff!! Will always keep returning"}
{"text":"I dined at Rachel's for lunch today. Ordered the turkey club on wheat with onion rings and a peanut butter shake. The woman who took my order was pleasant and helpful when I had questions. I've been here before and waited a long time for something to-go. But today I didn't wait very long at all to receive my food. I beat the lunch rush by just a few minutes though so I'm sure that played I to it. Everything was delicious and the music is always great as well! #classicrock I will return!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Really nothing special, food is ok at best, more crowded than it should be. I have a friend who frequents this place for milf watching and that's about all this place is good for. Gave two tries and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Yes, the food was great! Also, Vince was very helpful. I was very surprised to see the granola and homemade salad dressings Great service!"}
{"text":"I come here about 3-4 times a week. Always have to order an extra side of fries but the quality and size gets colder and smaller each time. Might be the last time I visit here for a while. 

Also be the last person to order in line. Watch and see, the person who orders the same thing as you will get the order first."}
{"text":"I had breakfast take out for the first time. I have to say I was not impressed. First strike...My order was messed up. I mean c'mon, you cant get breakfast for one person right? I called and spoke to the manager and while she was polite about it, her idea of resolution was not really satisfactory given what they charge for breakfast there. I had the breakfast that they call, \"The favorite\". It was $9.75 plus tax for a very mediocre meal from a storefront restaurant. They barely put in any of the ingredients the eggs are supposed to contain. I got ONE piece of bread, and it was not even buttered, nor was there any jelly in the bag.  I really expected more from a ten dollar breakfast. I will not be returning there."}
{"text":"Eaten breakfast twice now at the District location of Rachel's Kitchen.  As many note, there are several tables so you can dine al fresco.  Very nice, they are located near trees so you get some shade as well.  I imagine it wouldn't be comfortable at noon when it's over 100, but in the morning for breakfast it's great.

I've had the breakfast wrap and the protein scramble.  The wrap is a whole wheat wrap with bacon, eggs, cheese, and tomato.  I had them substitute the housemade salsa for tomato.  This was solid, but not spectacular.  The scramble on the other hand was excellent.  Spinach, bacon, chicken, with melted cheese.  Will definitely get this one again, the chicken and spinach are great together.

Breakfasts come with potatoes, which are diced and fried.  No seasoning, which is very annoying.  It's the weakest part of what otherwise is a very good meal.  I liberally use pepper and hot sauce on them.  You can substitute fruit for $1.25, which we did the second time we ate here.  Melon and pineapple mostly.  It's a good serving size.

The wife had the favorite scramble, which has a bunch of veggies and goat cheese.  I generally like anything with goat cheese, and this was no exception.  The sun dried tomatoes were really good in there.

The toast with homemade jam is a must.  Very good strawberry jam and good quality wheat toast.  It's a very solid breakfast for a good price in a nice location.  Hard to beat that..."}
{"text":"The food is good.  The staff needs some CS training.  Better leadership and this place has the potential to be a winner.  The staff is indifferent. I placed a togo order at the counter.  What I ordered and what was on the customer facing screen were different.  I pointed it out and it was corrected  and double check.  the bill was $60.  there is a automatic tip box on the interface.  I selected 15% as it was just a togo order.
when I got home it was still incorrect.  I called to let them know there was a glitch somewhere between the register the kitchen and the customer. the girl on the phone was incapable of understanding what I was saying.  she kept reading me what her ticket said.  I finally hung up.
the food will not disappoint.  the service may raise your blood pressure."}
{"text":"Surprises are rare in the lunch arena where speed and cost are the norm. Therefore it was a very pleasant surprise to get a truly imaginative tuna salad freshly made with organic ingredients! Nice tasty light dressing. Portions tend to be large, so either share or get a to go box!
One minor irritation which seems to be also happening at lots of Starbucks is loud music over the speakers. Guys please keep the sound down or preferably off. 4 stars"}
{"text":"I took my two small girls to Rachel's Kitchen for a fun lunch today, and it was just delicious.  I had the vegetarian sandwich on wheat with a side salad, and the girls had the mac and cheese.  From the roasted red peppers, to the cucumbers, to the pasta, it was easy to tell that all the ingredients were fresh, and I loved that (a rare occasion these days if you ask me!).  The service was friendly, and the atmosphere was conducive to being with or without the little ones (would definitely also go to Rachel's Kitchen with friends or with my husband).  Oh and the girls wanted to try the watermelon juice - HUGE hit with them, they drank the whole thing!  Great experience, had to share.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, great food and service.  Very comfortable place to have a really good meal and take a break from the heat and crowds.  Thanks Rachel!"}
{"text":"An informal gathering of breakfast goers on the weekend and Rachel's Kitchen in Summerlin is suggested.

It's set up more like a fast food restaurant - you head up to the counter to put your order in and they give you a number and you take your seat.

I ordered the Breakfast Burrito \"Scrambled eggs, salsa, avocado and swiss cheese wrapped in a flour tortilla, served with breakfast potatoes.\" ($7.25) and was surprised with how boring it tasted.  Although it had other fixings in it, it just tasted like eggs and nothing else.  I only ate half and brought the rest home (to jazz up for later). The potatoes were uninspiring as well.

The Husband ordered something from the breakfast menu too and was disappointed as well.  We can't even remember what it was, sadly enough.

Maybe it was our mistake that we both ordered two of the most boring items on the menu and that's why we were left disappointed.  Maybe you'll have better luck with their lunch items?"}
{"text":"Literally the best experience. 
Customer service is a 15 out of 10. 
Food was great. And they were able to give my group so much information and cater to our bodybuilding needs. 
The best. 
Hands down."}
{"text":"I've had lunch at the Rachel's in Henderson and enjoyed it but I was pretty disappointed with the breakfast meal I had at this location. It's called the Favorite - but ugh, it wasn't what I was expecting. It's scrambled eggs with avocado, mushrooms, goat cheese (which I'm a big fan of), among a couple other veggies which I can't remember right now. The breakfast potatoes were not cooked all the way for sure. The toast - it's just toast. The service was good though. It didn't take long for my food to be ready and I was asked if I wanted additional condiments - in which I asked for jelly. It was too expensive for breakfast for it to be that gross. I think I'll just stick with Eggworks or the Bagel Cafe and not come back here for breakfast again."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this location b/c it's convenient and they offer quite a selection for gluten free vegetarians and vegans. This is my 3rd time here and until the rating for this spot becomes better, I won't be rushing back.  Clearly after my last visit and the reviews I was reading, this place needs a makeover in management and staff.  My friend received a credit from corporate when she became extremely ill after eating their eggs for breakfast. Their email was so apologetic and being it was only her 2nd visit and she loved it the 1st time, it encouraged her to give them another chance so we chose to dine for a quick lunch as we only had 45 mins to spare.

I arrived 1st and the seating was limited and the tables weren't wiped off yet but I hurry and grabbed a spot for the 3 of us. We ordered our food at the same time and then sat at our table and shortly came out the fresh oj which was immediately sent back b/c it had a weird taste and after her last visit, she didn't want to chance it.  Then after a little bit of time my veggie burger came out but was missing it's avocado so the employee went back and got me a side order and then I needed silverware. Then once I took my 1st bite, my Garden burger was so cold. Not cool off cold but never was cooked enough cold. They use the Garden Burger brand so I know the patties are frozen but what a disappointment! I paid $10 for a cold veggie burger with tap water and felt like it was a waste of money. And then to top off our visit, the rest of my party was still waiting for their food after I had finished mine.  They were waiting for so long one of them had to ask twice about it. It finally came out, they hurried and scarfed it down and we went out the door.

Again I had high hopes for this location but it seems like the management team is lacking in training their staff to accommodate and prepare for their potential high volume. Don't send out half cooked food missing toppings and don't send out 1 order when the 2nd half take a 20 mins to be delivered. They have potential but until the kinks are worked out, I see more poor reviews coming."}
{"text":"Service always sucks. I don't think I've ever seen any employee SMILE here. I love their grilled chicken and veggie salad but tonight I tried their Acai bowl. It's 90 percent granola with raisins and dried fruit, 9 percent blended Acai, and 1 percent fresh fruit. Disgusting. Major fail Rachel's Kitchen! Granola is supposed to accent the Acai- not be the main dish. I was so unbelievably disappointed. Will never come here for an Acai bowl again!"}
{"text":"Tried twice.    So blah.   Expensive blah.....food tastes like the place looks....Boring!   I just don't get it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely satisfying Protein Lovers Scramble for me today. The Chinese Chicken salad is getting top marks too! If only is it was springtime or a tad warmer to enjoy the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Good food, ok prices but total Yuppie-ville (Summerlin location at least, I mean what can you expect). Haha. Usually get The Favorite for Breakfast and the Curry Chicken Wrap for lunch. The Favorite is simple. I really enjoy the goat cheese, avocado and sun-dried tomato mixer, topped with some Chalula. I don't feel over fed or gross afterwards, so that's always a plus. The Chicken Curry wrap is delicious, I highly recommend.

I still need to try their smoothies. I hear they are pretty tasty. 

Oh yeah, I will say their tables with the benches do sort of suck though. The bench is built too high for those tables, making it a little uncomfortable to eat at (you've got to hunch over to get to your food) They probably should have taken that into consideration when designing the joint."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, asset to Hilton, with welcoming efficient staff.  The menu is vast, covering all areas of taste.  Our selections exceeded expectations both in quality & quantity.  A sure \"come back\" to when in Henderson NV.  The mgr. Liz made it a point to visit our table, personalization that is too rare these days."}
{"text":"I wish I could get excited about Rachels. I've eaten there over the years and I love the seating outside and when they had live music it's fun. Now the food. Bland bland bland. If you get the comfort food I/e toasted cheese sandwich etc it's good. But the salads ,wraps and sandwiches are so tasteless. 
Breakfast is decent but they insist on cooking eggs with high heat and burning them.
Prices are towards the high side. I wish they would get someone who could add flavor and they would have a winning combo."}
{"text":"Had breakfast this morning with my wife. Breakfast burrito was great. Eggs cooked , not burned. Potatoes spot on. My wife's Açaí bowl was runny and oatmeal had raisins. That needs to stop. Raisin do not help the runny Acai. 

Staff was nice and prompt. Only real complaint, the music. Was hip hop club. At 8am it's too much. How about some light music or even holiday music. 
Will order to go probably next time if this crap is playing."}
{"text":"Love the variety in the menu here. Fresh squeezed juice and the salads. Breakfast menu looks great too, will have to try it!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today. I was really looking forward to it because I had heard so many great things about Rachel's kitchen. After eating here I cannot imagine what they were talking about. The food was less than mediocre. 

I had Rachel's chicken salad sandwich and sweet potato fries. The fries were cold. I mean very cold, like they had been sitting for 30 or 40 minutes cold. The sandwich should not be called chicken salad. There was barely any chicken. Basically you get diced apple pieces, sliced grapes and mayonnaise, with a tiny amount of chicken here or there. For $9.95 cold fries and fruit on stale bread. No thanks. 

I do plan to go back. I want to give them a second chance just because everyone else seems to enjoy it. I think I'll try breakfast next time. Maybe it is served hot. Wish me luck."}
{"text":"After a whirlwind trip in Vegas I found myself wandering around D Gates looking for food. I was tempted by some of the airport standards but decided to see what was hot on Yelp.

The nearest and best rated place I saw was Rachel's Kitchen and after reading some reviews I decided to give it a go. Fresh juices and ready to go food options is what laid before me. I grabbed the Curry Chicken Salad Sandwich and ordered up Popeyes Secret juice. The was no line and my juice was whipped up faster than Popeye could pop open a can of spinach.

After I paid (email receipt ftw), I took a sip of the juice and could literally feel the satisfaction in my body as the toxins I've absorbed by simply walking through the smoke filled Casinos started to dissipate. I had to restrain myself from slamming the juice in one go.

Next up was the sandwich. Damn was this good. Best grab and go sandwich I've ever had at an airport. Hell, one of the best things I've ever eaten at an airport period. A little heat from the curry and all the deliciousness you'd expect. Towards the end of the sandwich it started to fall apart but what's that saying? If it doesn't get all over the place it doesn't belong in your face. I loved it and Vanessa, thank you for making this sandwich. It was great.

To sum it all up, if you're looking for something fast, tasty, healthy and amazing, Rachel's Kitchen is your place to be. Also, look for the sandwiches made by Vanessa. I haven't had any others made by someone else but so far she has me over the moo. 

Update: 5/10, found myself back in Vegas and just had to hit this place up again. Nothing but goodness. I had the same sandwich as before but went for a different juice this time, Sweet Greens, and it was just as amazing. It reminded me of a juice I would do at home except I would just up 2x habanero for an extra kick at the end ;-)"}
{"text":"I didn't want to stay on the strip for lunch so I took the kids out for a little drive. We ended  up at this little restaurant and everything was delicious. We had an albacore tuna salad and pancakes."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch last week and decided to order the chicken salad that all my friends rave about, I have to agree it was phenomenal, the service was excellent, I believe my server was Robert, he was very courteous and polite, the place is very clean, I would highly recommend it for a good healthy meal!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been into Rachel's Kitchen in a while. I remembered that they served smoothies and I had a craving for one. I arrived about 20 minutes before noon and it was only slightly busy. 

I waited for the two cashiers to finish with their customers and then approached the young lady that was on the right register. She looked at me and then picked up the phone. The other cashier was still taking people's orders and I just stood there and waited. The young lady finished with the call and said to me pointing at the other cashier \"( insert cashiers name) will help you shortly.\" So I still waited. Then that cashier almost walked away, but he noticed I was a bit annoyed and asked to take my order. I already knew what I wanted which was a small Berry Mania Smoothie with whey protein. 

So I sat and looked at my phone. Out of the corner of my eye I see someone start to make my smoothie. She had to exit the smoothie making area to the dining area several times to get ice and other things I wasn't sure. It just seems terribly inefficient. My smoothie took 15 minutes to make. That just seems crazy. Rachel's was kinda busy, but there was plenty of staff working. 

Then when I actually got my smoothie it was bad. The whey protein was not mixed in at all and was gritty. For $7 I expected better. 

It makes me really sad to write this review. I will go back for other things on their menu, but maybe just no smoothies. As for the experience with the staff hopefully they will get some better instruction or maybe just some people that show they care."}
{"text":"Great salad! Had a spinach salad and it was yummy! Service was nice and Analisa was adorable and helpful."}
{"text":"Great place. Everything's taste delicious, healthy for easy quick breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Whether you're having salad, sandwich or smoothie they have it all & super delicious!!!! #YumYum!"}
{"text":"Good Eats!  Their juice blends are always a refreshing stop during the day.  The salads, pastas and sandwiches are good & tasty!"}
{"text":"Great food, healthy and non-healthy too. Nove patio. Service a bit slow on busy day, but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to have this good food catered.

Wow. I'm not a big sandwich guy, but this place really went above with taste. The salad was extremely generous with the chicken. The sandwich was also packed. Tasty with enough food to satisfy me? (I'm always hungry). 

Definitely looking forward to stop by."}
{"text":"When I visit new restaurants for the first time, I typically find one or two things that make it less than a five star experience. In this case, I could find no flaw. One of my fellow diners made a special request which they did without question. I had the cheese burger and fries. It was fantastic. All who dined with me for lunch enjoyed their food. It was a great atmosphere and they have free wifi which was needed for the meeting we were having there. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Love this place, everything is so fresh and healthy, you can also get fresh juice by your choice, Great for breakfast and brunch.
Definitely will come back and recommend"}
{"text":"Another convenient location!  This time, they moved into the bottom floor of the Ogden in downtown Las Vegas!!  My company is moving downtown in September and it's nice to know there's a Rachel's Kitchen around the corner.  On this visit, me and my work team came for a quick lunch before our quarterly company meeting.  

I love the look of this restaurant.  No matter which location, you will be treated to a nice, clean bistro style restaurant.  This location has little round tables and high bar tops lining the front window.  The front counter is truly the star of the show, has a huge menu for your convenience and a viewing window for pastries.  The staff is friendly and very attentive.  You order, pay, grab your number and find a seat.  Your food will be brought to you when it's ready!  Super convenient :)

For lunch, I got the same gourmet sandwich I get in every visit:  The turkey club on wheat bread.  Smoked turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, avocado, romaine lettuce, tomatoes and mayo served on three slices of your bread choice.  For me, what makes this sandwich is the avocado and mayo.  I love a sandwich with both.  It ties it all together and because of that, it's the best for me.  The turkey is nicely smoked, they give you a lot of slices and makes this sandwich super flavorful.  For my drink, I always get the Wilshire Smoothie.  It's filled with peaches, bananas, pineapples, fresh squeezed orange juice and nonfat vanilla frozen yogurt.  I always add kale to it for my serving of a super food.  Such a great smoothie, blended with all my favorites!!  Definitely a must try.  

Overall, a great bistro place!  Remember, on Sundays, mimosas are only $3.  I hope my review has enticed you to visit.  If you're looking for clean food with great service, come check them out.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in to get an Acia Bowl and found out that they have removed them from their menu. Panicked me because I love theirs with some fresh brewed tea in the mornings. The women behind the counter was great and told me the were still able to make them. What a relief. Place is super clean and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Our recruiting team decided to have our monthly meeting at Rachel's Kitchen to spend a couple of hours at the District.  I'm glad we did!

One things for sure, this place is busy!!  Rachel's Kitchen is perfect for the District and really attracts a lot of people.  Young people, families, little children, there were so many people here.  I could tell that the food was going to be good.

I decided to get the Smoked Turkey and Avocado sandwich on wheat bread.  This sandwich has smoked turkey, avocado, swiss cheese, mixed greens, tomatoes and chipotle mayo with a mixed salad as my side.  The sandwich is huge!  I appreciated the huge chunks of avocado.  The chipotle mayo really married the sandwich together.  I also loved the balsamic vinaigrette on my mixed green salad side.  No wonder why this place was packed!  The food was great :)

The service was top notch as well!  Everyone was so attentive and more than one server kept visiting our table to see if we were doing great.  I definitely think you need to get your butt here.  You will absolutely love it.  Great new joint in the District at Green Valley."}
{"text":"Quick breakfast to start the day.  Food is fresh and tasty. Everything is prepared to order so it takes just a few minutes to get your food. They have nice indoor and outdoor seating in a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Average food, average menu, average everything. Not really a \"kitchen\" -- more like a smoothie and juice bar with a large grab-and-go case, and some sandwiches. For an airport venue, it has a good presence and benefits from well thought-out branding, although it borders on mom-and-pop just because of the disconnect between the branding and the actual experience. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I havent been to the four other locations, but excited to have a new food option in my hood. It's exactly what I expected - healthy cafe fare. Meh, for some, a positive for me. Nice to have the option to go somewhere and eat clean if I want to....or not and get some fries with it. 

The BF and I decided to share: 

Curried chicken salad sandwich - this had nice flavor and enjoyed the pear (? or green apple) and raisins in the mix. We chose French bread, but it came on a ciabatta shape instead, that's OK though. We picked sweet potato fries as our side and that was standard, but solid fare. 

Angel Hair Bolognese - anytime I see bolognese I do want to try it. This was more in the \"meat sauce\" catagory than bolognese with carrots, celery, peas, etc. in it that other spots do. It was a rather large bowl and came piping hot! Decent homestyle sauce though. 

It's counter order, get a number and DIY drinks so there isn't \"service\" to rate, but they we're friendly at the counter. I've seen in other locations reviews that it was \"pricey\", so I was actually surprised it was prices I was fine with. $9.95 for a sandwich and side didn't seem outrageous to me when a shitty chain diner like Denny's is charging about that. 

I'm sure we will be back. I hear so much about their juice and smoothies that I definitely have to pop in for one soon as well as more of the menu. Good addition to the area, we don't really have a little cafe up here."}
{"text":"Had lunch here. Very good food!.. Wasn't expecting the quality to be so good!

Polite helpful staff also. Well worth the small increase from a fast food franchise place! Much better!

Plenty of items to choose from also. Pretty crowed when we arrived but the staff handled it very well. 

You need to try it. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Want a great salad?  Try the arugula pear salad at Rachel's!  Very tasty, and filling.  I always leave feeling healthy!  Smoothies are pricey, but all in all a great spot!"}
{"text":"Fanstastic Food! And Great service! Been here in DT Las Vegas for 2 days and have eaten here for breakfast twice!

What I ate: Sautéed Mushroom burger! Excellent burger at a very affordable price!

Definitely recommend this joint!"}

{"text":"Im working in Henderson today and decided to use my trusty Yelp App to find a quick place for lunch. Much to my surprise, I see Rachel's kitchen pop up .. inside the Hilton Garden Inn on Warm Springs. Ive dined at the summerlin & downtown locations and like their menu. Besides, there is no herd of people here or lines to stand in here ... which is great for me! Todays fare is a fried chicken wrap with sweet potato fries as a side. The food was quick to the table. Fries were like room temp, not hot or even warm. They play classic rock in the dining room so that earns 1 star all unto itself. The wrap is what i expected. The dining room is wrapped in windows so plenty of natural sunlight here. They deliver and I think they also cater but not 100% sure. The server asked if i wanted ketchup but got sidetracked and totally forgot me. Oh well.... not perfect here but really who is??"}
{"text":"Met four other friends here to check out a new place for breakfast. Though we arrived at 8:30 a.m., we were able to order anything off their menu all day long - a nice perk. We were met with smiles and welcomes by their courteous staff. Our breakfast choices were plentiful and very tasty. The food was delivered to our table in a very timely manner.  Prices seemed quite reasonable. I'm a big iced tea fan and they had green tea and tropical passion iced tea to chose from. The decor was comfortable, refreshing and inviting. I personally LOVED the background music playing as it reminded me of my younger years! When I asked my friends how many stars they would rate on their first visit to Rachel's Kitchen on a scale of 1 to 4, they all said 4 stars. Enough said."}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast on occasion. The food is always fresh and you get exactly what you order (nothing fancy) it's a bit pricey but the food is good enough to keep me coming back"}
{"text":"This place has awesome food, and good prices. Highly recommend!!! Vince was really great, and handled everything perfectly. Will return and will recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Rachel's kitchen is located in The District @ Green Valley Ranch.

I always see Ms. Christie O. checking in this place at her location in Summerlin so I decided to give it a try with my girlfriend.

We ordered;

Spinach Salad- To die for! It is composed of spinach, bacon bits, nuts,

Chef Salad with the insides of a Rachel's special- Not on the menu decided to invite my own! haha! really deli-sh as well. It consists of chicken apples, and other healthy stuff.

Garden Pasta- Not really fond of it it had peas yuck.. But when i tasted it , the sauce it was cooked with was good.. just did not like peas.. hehe im sure you guys will love it.

Buffalo Chicken Wrap- wrapped in a tortia based texture, and in the inside of it it had lettuce, cheese, chicken, flavored with BBQ.. It was ok too BBQ tasting for me.. hehe  know i should have known it was in the name.. haha!

We wanted to try the popeye drink but it was not available kinda bummed out, but will be back and hopefully they will not run out.

Overall, I love this place, I feel good clean and healthy eating here.. There are so many options for everyone for health fanatics and for burger lovers, the menu has a little bit of everything that will fit everyone's foodie desires..

TRY NOW!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"I wanted a breakfast burrito with fries instead of Potatoes O'Brien. The clerk said they can't do that because of a policy. She said I could order fries on the side. I asked to speak to a manager, as it didn't seem like a situation that a restaurant would say \"no\" to. The clerk responded, \"I am the manager.\" How unfortunate. This is an example of a customer service failure."}
{"text":"I love coming into Rachel's Kitchen and whenever I come in Tatiana always provides excellent service! She's attentive and has a beautiful personality! Not to mention the salads and the vegan burger are mouth-watering!! The sweet potato fries are to die for as well :)"}
{"text":"This place was pretty much empty on a busy Thursday afternoon in the shopping center, and I can see why.

I got the Chicken Curry Salad sandwich, and unless your idea of curry is mayo mixed with celery and carrot shreds, you'll be disappointed. Sweet Potato fries were flimsy and soggy, I don't even know what happened there. Topped off with the unfriendly and unhelpful staff, definitely not coming back here."}
{"text":"First time here because one of my other favorite healthy breakfast spots ran out of what I wanted. VERY impressed and will make sure that I come back on a regular basis. If you haven't tried the Acai Bowl I highly recommend you do so."}
{"text":"Pricey yummy upscale diner food type stuff here but what you can also get is a watermelon smoothie.  

A watermelon smoothie that tastes like a real watermelon. 

Like seriously, surprisingly like a real watermelon.

Like I was with someone who was in Vegas two years ago and had one and insisted on bringing me here to have one. 

Watermelon.

No artificial flavoring, just watermelon.

{"text":"Rachel kitchen is nice organic cafe with smoothies, sandwiches and coffee. Service is speedy and very friendly environment. I been going to this spot since it opened. I just can't believe that I never left a reviewed about them. Only thing I would like to see if they would change the menu or do sandwich of the month to keep me going there. 
I mainly go for a nice smoothie. But wish u would crave their food.  Hope this review helps your Business."}
{"text":"I got the Fettuccine Alfredo w Chicken and the Banana/Peanut butter smoothie with a friend. The Fettuccine Alfredo was not as bad as I thought it might be. I love Fettuccine Alfredo but always feel afraid to order it anywhere because most of the time, it turns out pretty bland. I actually quite enjoyed it here. I also never get it with chicken because the way chicken in this dish seems to come often is this smokey-type prepared chicken and I don't like it. But this was pretty different and I thought it was good. 
The smoothie was good, but it's something you can make at home easy-peasy. Buy a blender."}
{"text":"Waited 20 mins for my Acai Berry smoothie today. Just a smoothie. Took them 15 minutes to acknowledge my order. I understand that you might have a large order... But I have ONE smoothie. ONE. It does not take 20 minutes to make a smoothie."}
{"text":"Really great service!! Great garden burger :) we had a big group of 6 and they served us quickly! Best place to eat after Ragnar vegas exchange 6"}
{"text":"Rachel's kitchen over off trail wood is the best! The staff is my favorite and the food is absolutely amazing. I eat here at least every other day. They should create a salad and call it the Lindsey salad since I'm always changing things and adding to them. :) Great place always something different to try.  I could eat here for every meal. My choices are Caesar Salad with Grilled chick and the macaroni and cheese!"}
{"text":"I want to like Rachel's Kitchen more than I do.  To me, this place should be a slam-dunk.  They offer fresh food and healthy alternatives to the normal restaurant fare.  However, there are a few things that really bother me about this place.  Let me elaborate.

The first problem I've encountered is inconsistency.  I like going to places where I know that I can order the same thing more than once and get, well, the same thing.  Sometimes I get stuck in ruts and return to places over and over for a particular menu item.  That's how I know whether a place is consistent or not... and this place isn't.  I have ordered the same wrap (a BBQ chicken one) a dozen or so times.  Sometimes it absolutely blows me away.  Sometimes it is flavorless and skimpy on the filling.  Since I never know which way it is going to be prepared, I usually opt for other food places while I'm at The District.  The prices at Rachel's are similar to Panera, but at least I know how my Panera will taste.

Secondly, the service is somewhat lacking.  At times, I've been greeted with a smile.  Other times, I am greeted with a huff.  It goes along with this consistency issue that seems to be a theme at Rachel's - I like to know that I'm not going to be punished because the person taking my order is having a bad day.  

Lastly, some of the tables are TINY.  Like, barely large enough for two people to comfortably fit their orders on the tabletop.  Last time I visited, my fiance ordered a salad and I had a wrap.  Once you added drinks and utensils to the mix, it was a cramped mess.  Between the crowded tabletop and the fact that the table was scooted waaaaay too close to the line of people waiting to order, I felt claustrophobic and wanted to leave.

When Rachel's is good, it's some of the best food around.  When it's not, it feels like highway robbery.  I really wish this place would live up to its potential!"}
{"text":"I've come in here a few times for breakfast and I have always left full and satisfied! The employees are always friendly and happy to assist with any menu questions. The atmosphere is light and welcoming. The food is fantastic, I recommend the omelettes with potatoes on the side...yum! Check them out!!"}
{"text":"We arrived for a late lunch around 1:30pm today.  The outside was about half full but all empty tables were dirty with dishes.  We went inside to order and had to wait some time to get someone to help out.  Once the order was completed, we had difficulty finding a clean table on the inside, being that they were all dirty also.  We had to go back to get a cup for the drink we had purchased.  No lids available.  The table we finally sat at needed to be wiped down.  The staff were all talking and walking around trying to find a man a place to plug in his phone to charge.  They were not helping the other people waiting to order.  At this point, it became comical.  No sense of urgency was seen at any point while we were inside this establisment.  It's a shame.  After this experience, I will no longer want to patronize any of the Rachel's kitchens in the valley.  The food wasn't anything spectaular and the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Wonderful little spot in the district! The food selection is great. I got half veggie Sandwhich with sweet potato fries and a fresh cup of tomato basil soup which was perfect for the cold gloomy day!! And for a pick me up their energizer juice is delicious with hints of ginger. The staff (boys) were just sweet as can be and really caring. When my sister needed to plug to charge her phone they hid it behind the counter. When I was dying of sneezing due to an allergy attack they brought my napkins without me even having to ask!! Serious customer service right there!! They were awesome! This place is great!"}
{"text":"Breakfast with my daughter and nephew. They serve Peet's Coffee which is a plus. Also mimosas and wine. I ordered the protein lovers scramble and it's delicious"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Rachel's kitchen! Located in the District at Green Valley Ranch, Rachel's offers healthy affordable breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

They have a decent selection of beer and wine that won't break the bank -like usually Vegas pricing. 

They have a beautiful outdoor dining area that is pet friendly and has shade during the summer. 

Come by and have breakfast with a mimosa on the patio! You may run into me!"}
{"text":"@RachelsKitchen_ A colorful place. Good food. It was recommended by a man who owns a parking lot nearby in the Fremont Street district.

The breakfast was standard for the price. No flavors were bold or stood out. The onion rings were big but scarce. They made the plate look large there were so few. Smoothie: Eh. Unimpressed. The ingredients looked fresh. 

I had a great conversation with one of the delivery guys. He rides a bike toting meals. His tips go into the tip jar to be divided up with the rest of the staff. Bummer he rides all over in rain and heat and has to share his tips with the other employees who stand at the register in air conditioning.

There was no regular black iced tea. There were several teas including green tea. Not regular black tea.

I recommend giving this place a try. It offers an extensive menu, from breakfast to sandwiches, and is a different option dining experience for the area. It seemed a little forced and stuffy though. Visit for breakfast. You'll be glad you did. I was glad. Hunger is the best spice."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. 

Employees are friendly and prepare food fast. 
Dining area has a nice style to it, and is kept clean and orderly. 
Food is fairly priced, and tastes great, I haven't had any hiccups. 
My favorite is the protein lover's scramble."}
{"text":"Feeling better, having dinner with david. Our server Adrian was wonderful, i want to give him a personal shoutout for super customer service!"}
{"text":"I come here just for the watermelon juice! We also come here a lot for breakfast. I always get one of the two breakfast wraps. I love them so much that I can't force myself to try anything else. The breakfast potatoes are really good as well! We definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"I've tried several items on their menu (smoke turkey on lettuce was the latest) & it's always been yummy! I love that I can eat great food that's well prepared but that I don't feel sluggish after. I also love that it's close by my job & I can order online for pickup. Two thumbs up from this girl!!"}
{"text":"My first time to Rachel's kitchen...lots of my Yelp neighbors were makin a big deal out of it, so I figured I would give them a go when the time was right!

The items I've tried so far :

440 Sandwich ($10.50): Grilled Chicken Breast, Goat Cheese, Avocado, Roasted Red Peppers and Tomatoes, and Romaine Lettuce. Good, healthy sandwich lol. It felt a little spendy, but you are paying for fresh ingredients in a health conscious restaurant...so it kind of comes with the territory. 

Hawaiian Bliss Smoothie : Pineapples, Banana, Coconut, Pineapple Juice, and Non Fat Vanilla Frozen Yogurt. This was probably my favorite shake out of the 3 I've tried so far!

Sunrise Smoothie : Strawberries, Bananas, Fresh Squeezed OJ, Apple Juice, and Non Fat Vanilla Frozen Yogurt. 2nd favorite...yum :P

Peanut Butter Blast Smoothie : Bananas, Peanut Butter, Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups, Chocolate Milk, and Non Fat Vanilla Frozen Yogurt.  I think they compensate for the peanut butter, since that shake was a little more \"runny\" vs the others.

Oatmeal Raisin Cookie and Chocolate Chip Cookie ($1.50ea). Good cookies...they probably go light on the butter and sugar here. Juuust sweet enough, but it's definitely a \"healthy\" cookie.

Overall it is a pretty good deli style setup for quick eats that won't make you feel guilty eating it afterwards :)

Check out the pics :"}
{"text":"Highly upset. I've given this particular location multiple opportunities. Firstly, the sweet potatoes are never fresh. They're always warm, never cooked to order. I ordered a burger this particular day and it was flavorless. Tasted like nothing really. What made me upset the most is the fact that the lettuce that was on the burger was all stems. Wtf?

Update

I was contacted by the manager or owner I'm not sure. The issue was rectified. He apologized and sent me a gift card to give Rachel's Kitchen another try. I did and I ordered the same exact thing. This time there was actual lettuce lol and it was flavourful. The fries were actually hot. So I am very pleased and will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Rachel kitchen has become my go to place for a nice healthy meal that doesn't break the bank. The fact that I can get a free muffin each time I check in is always a plus (bc those things are BOMB). The sandwiches are always made with the right amount of avocado and I always wish I had more of the sweet potato fries.

Don't forget to check in!"}
{"text":"A clean establishment. Food seems to be on the healthier side. A little spendy but not outrageous. I went for lunch and ordered the turkey burger wrapped in lettuce with a side of regular fries. I haven't had many turkeys burgers so I don't have much to compare to, but it was juicy and pretty tasty. The fries are skinny just like I like but they were pretty cold when served. I went back a second time and ordered the same thing and the fries weren't as cold but still not as hot as I'd like. The meal was a little over $9 and I felt satisfied when I left."}
{"text":"My brother was craving a breakfast burrito. When I yelped \"breakfast\", I found Rachel's. The pictures had a huge impact on my decision to choose Rachel's along with the reviews, of course.

Once I arrived I thought it was a good location. It's very accessible and easy to find. When you walk in, it feels inviting. That's always a good thing. 

While I waited for my order I looked at menu and honestly, I thought everything seemed so delightful. Including the smoothies and juices. 

When I arrived back to my place and opened the box containing my breakfast burrito, it looked delicious. The presentation in the box was neat. The breakfast potatoes were on the side of the burrito while the burrito laid wrapped with Logo wax paper. Nice!

I took a bite and that's all it took for me. It was great. It was fresh. Guacamole was fresh and bacon was crisp. Simply perfect. 

I would definitely return when I'm back in town.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Located in The District this is going to be our go-to place during our visit here this week. Clean restaurant, outdoor seating, and wide variety on the menu makes it easy for everyone in your party to find something. Order at the counter and they bring your food out to your table. Great service overall, the food coming out was on a slow side so allow time for that. 

Smoothies = awesomeness. Really - they are amazing. You have to get one. 
Wraps - also good; curry chicken had interesting (in a good way) flavor. 
Salad - Caesar w/ chicken was huge and tough to finish. 

Looking forward to going back for breakfast or a light evening snack and a drink!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is always so fresh and good. It's always my first choice! Chicken tender wrap and sweet potato fries are so good. You won't feel guilty for eating out when you come here! Yesenia was so helpful with describing the menu and helping us make our minds up with all the amazing choices!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped by here for brunch after having their food catered to my work numerous times. I created my own omelette and my boyfriend got the protein scramble with some fresh juices. I got the sweet green and he got the carrot juice. Everything was really good and well prepared! I'll definitely be back, especially for the juices."}
{"text":"Picked up 2 dishes to go the other week.  Friends recommended Signature and Gardens pastas, and they did not disappoint!  Both dishes were tasty, reasonably sized and priced ($13).  Checked in on Yelp and got a free muffin; 3 different flavors to chose from.

The whole menu seems reasonably priced.  I'd want to try brunch and def return for pasta.  

Thanks, Rachel!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a great stop for a coffee or a meal and in a perfect location. The food is delicious. My favorite menu items are the smoothies. The atmosphere outside is great for co-working and enjoying a lunch break. Also, they have parking-which is hard to find downtown."}
{"text":"Excellent greetings by 3 different employees upon entering. I appreciate great service. While they are still in opening stages, training new employees, and etc. The food was excellent and the service was warm, inviting, and friendly.  Thank you also to Bri for making the kids feel extra welcomed and comfortable!"}
{"text":"The staff here REALLY need an attitude adjustment. Why am I being stared down and given dirty looks while ordering? This place is empty for a reason I guess, and judging by the other reviews other customers have experienced the same \"friendliness.\" Too bad because they make great smoothies and sandwiches."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently stopped by Rachel's Kitchen for lunch after a friend recommended their heathly food and good-for-you juices.
I had a delicious chicken curry wrap and my husband had the albacore tuna sandwich. The salad and the chicken curry was very tasty. My husband LOVED the albacore sandwich and we both shared the immunity booster juice. (Kale, carrots, and other yummies)
We highly recommend Rachel's Kitchen  to anyone who would like a healthy alternative for a good and satisfying meal.
Also, the manager was very kind and professional and the kitchen staff was very friendly. The restroom was in the Hilton hotel portion of the restaurant so it was very clean."}
{"text":"Las Vegas needs more places like Rachel's--little cafes with a pleasing selection of sandwiches, salads, pastas, smoothies and breakfast. I am always looking for this type of place, but it seems as if Jason's Deli is often the only answer. Jason's, however, doesn't make you feel cozy, and they use their soup as a pasta sauce (a little weird) so I am glad I found Rachel's.

It is a small space decked out in warm orange and green with about 10 mosaic-covered tables. There is also classic outdoor Las Vegas seating, and by \"classic\" I mean you get to sit next to the parking lot. They only offer counter service, so you place your order and get a number to sit on your table. Overall, I would say the atmosphere is pleasant and clean.

The service is also pleasant. The lady behind the counter was super helpful. Special orders do not upset them, as I overheard her working with every guest to substitute this for that or give a side of this. Likewise, she told me if anything in my pasta dish was not to my liking they could leave it out. 

The menu offerings are all likable. No, I didn't eat them all. I just meant they sound like I could eat them all. Some highlights include a chopped salad with broccoli, red cabbage, olives and garbanzo beans, a garden burger, a beer battered fish wrap, curry chicken salad and mac & cheese. They also have banana chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast; I need to try those out. 

I had the Signature Pasta: penne with sautéed chicken breast, eggplant, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms with a tomato cream sauce. It was the most expensive thing on the menu at $11.50, and I must say I am a bit disappointed it did not come with a little salad. (Prices are bordering on a bit too much, but the wraps, burgers and sandwiches all come with salad, french fries or onion rings.) To drink, I had their passion fruit iced tea. Bonus points for having a creative iced tea, and I also noticed that their selection of hot teas is whole leaf. More bonus.

The pasta came out piping hot; several minutes into eating, I was still having to blow on bites to cool them down. Hot food makes me happy, so that was a good thing. The combination of flavors was pretty scrumptious, and I scarfed down the entire bowl. 

I am definitely a fan for a quick lunch! It is fairly close to my hood, so that helps. I will definitely be exploring more menu items, i.e. pancakes, in the near future."}
{"text":"The food is awesome- however, over priced without a doubt. I appreciate their tasty vegan menu options. 
That being said... is there a commission offered for hoarding the ketchup? Seriously though, I ask for extra and get a single packet :-/"}
{"text":"I always look foward to the aruglia pear salad,  its delicious!! perfect little cafe to get great food and enjoy the atsmophere, Im listening to soft beautiful music, definatly a must try, great food!"}
{"text":"I tried, I really did
First time I had a breakfast wrap and it was good, it filled me quickly and tasted better then a Mcdonalds breakfast.

The second time we went in the employees were a little impatient as we weren't sure what we wanted and we kept asking questions, (don't worry, we didn't have anyone behind us in line so I didn't annoy many others) we settled on 2 chicken salad wraps and a Cesar wrap.

I hate saying but I wasn't impressed... the wrap was a little stale and the flavors were a little lacking.

I really wanted this to be great as the variety is above most fast food joints and the healthy options seem wonderful 

I should give them another try...

If I do, I will let you know"}
{"text":"I've come to this location a few times and I love their turkey club! Its a huge sandwich and I usually only eat half! I love to pair it with onion rings with a side of chipotle mayo! Its delicious.. I love coming in and seeing the friendly staff always greet me and ask how I'm doing .. Come to Rachel's kitchen, they won't disappoint !"}
{"text":"I have been meeting a friend here for breakfast every time I come to Vegas. We love the wholesome food selection and the outdoor seating on nice mornings. The food is really consistent and I have had a variety of breakfast items on the menu. The service is generally good. You order at the counter and the server brings your dish out to you. No follow up they I've ever seen. This time, my son had ordered a smoothie that we had to return to ask for and he was disappointed in his meal, the protein lover's scramble.  He felt the portion was small and that it had a very small amount of chicken and bacon in the meal. The Protein Lovers Scramble is 3 eggs scrambled with chicken, bacon and cheddar cheese. 

My friend and I each had The Favorite:  3 eggs scrambled with goat cheese, spinach, sun dried tomatoes and avocado.  We had the seasoned potatoes with it as well.  We both were happy with our plates.  I thought it had very good flavor and the portions were good for us as well. 

We checked in and got free, super large muffins as well.  I didn't try one, but the consensus was that they were delicious!

I will come back to Rachel's again. It is a bit pricey but I like the healthier options available."}
{"text":"When my business and life partner originally booked us a spot at this unknown (to us) little cafe in Old Vegas I was very skeptical as most are. After all its our human nature right? Well, what an experience we had from the moment we were greeted by the friendly staff and throughout our visit. The seating process was quick and easy, the ordering process was painless and the staff was nothing short of amazing! 

The FOOD- Wowza was this a great option for a clean and light meal and so amazingly fresh. Everything was prepared fresh and to order. I would make it a point on any trip to Vegas to eat here again! What an awesome experience and awesome staff. Thanks Kathy for a wonderful experience! 

Hope to see you soon!

{"text":"I like the concept, but after 1 visit a month ago I can't say we've really been itching to go back. 

Signature Pasta ($11.50)
Penne with chicken breast, eggplant, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms with our Tomato cream sauce. 

Hmmm does that say cheese anywhere?! I was doing no cheese for Lent and was pretty upset when I got my take out container home and saw the entire thing was covered in thick goopy mozzarella. Cheese issues aside, it wasn't particularly special - especially for the price. 

BBQ Chicken wrap ($9.95) - husband got this, again wasn't overly impessed. 

The saving grace was the reasonably priced and AMAZING smoothie -

Hawaiian Bliss ($4.50) - pineapples, bananas, coconut, pineapple juice, NF vanilla yogurt. YUM (but if you follow my reviews you know I'm a pineapple/banana/coconut slut, so I guess me liking this isn't all that surprising!). 

They do have $3 mimosas on Sundays so hopefully I'll be back at some point to try the breakfast with a mimosa! Additionally, I've heard the patio seating is doggie friendly - a major plus ."}
{"text":"This is a good place to have a terrific lunch although they serve breakfast as well. The food was FRESH and super tasty. This place definitely stands out from your average sandwich/wrap/salad joint. 

I had the pleasure of tasting the \"440\" Sandwich- very satisfying! Your choice of bread, [I WOULDNT CHOOSE THE FRENCH BREAD AGAIN though, only because all the ingredients kept slipping out and just plain made a mess of everything] comes with CHICKEN, AVOCADO, SWEET RED PEPPER, LETTUCE, TOMATO- DELICIOUS. You get a choice of onion rings, sweet potatoes, or fries. I tried both the ONION RINGS AND SWEET POTATOES, but the sweet potatoes take the cake! YUMMY. I also tried the WATERMELON JUICE - it was good, but I didn't get what everyone was raving about in reviews- I mean, it simple, just plain watermelon juice. If you try it, make sure you ask for ice in your cup! 

What I enjoyed most about this place is that there's a variety of items on the menu- something for everyone- pasta, burgers, hummus, dessert items etc.. I wasn't too fond of their seating arrangement and the place is really small. AND sadly the service was not very good as they completely forgot to make my friends order- ON THE PLUS SIDE: they gave him a free dessert for the mistake. I would come here again and recommend it to all my health junkies :)"}
{"text":"The juice was phenomenal! I ordered carrot juice with ginger, apple, and celery. It was a perfect combination. All of the food is super fresh with lots of healthy choices and the restaurant was cutely decorated and very clean. 

After your meal I also recommend checking out Roy's liquor store next door. The owner is very friendly and knowledgeable about his products. It's the type of place where every customer is treated like family."}
{"text":"This restraunt location is the worst. I never go out of my way to Yelp review businesses but the prices of the food $27.39 for two salads and sweet potatoes fries was silly but the 25 minute wait to get 2 salads and an order of sweet potato fries was a joke. Who ever owns this restaurant should take note of the reviews concerning the average good with a ridiculous wait time. I will NEVER dine at this place again.

{"text":"I loved their pasta! They do not jip on pasta and they taste super fresh. Def plan to return and try their others dishes because they seemed fresh and healthy."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place a little hard to find. Inside/attached to Hilton garden hotel. 
I got the smoked turkey on ciabatta  - excellent! Subbed for the fresh fruit bowl - good portion. Also got the Hawaiian smoothie which was also good.
Loved spending the time in their enclosed patio eating area. Service was kind as well."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch today. Jeanette helped us when we got there . She was wonderful great suggestions. Love my veggie sandwich..  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid place to eat. Fresh, quality ingredients that you can taste, and generally a very polite and friendly staff. It's not a place I'd recommend for a quick bite to eat, however. It's located on the bottom floor of a nice condo tower, right on the corner of Downtown Las Vegas and Bum Central. Don't be surprised to see a homeless person sleeping on their patio. 
The environment inside is very clean, although a bit cluttered in the seating arrangement. It's more like communal dining at your own, separate table. Their bathrooms are always spotless, which is a clear indication that they value cleanliness. They even bus your tables for you (on a side note, I'd recommend using glassware for dine-in guests to save on waste. You're already bussing the tables and washing plates and flatware). 
Back to the food. Huge menu done right. Again, I cannot stress how fresh everything always tastes. They cook everything to order, and the menu boasts some familiar foods with an upscale twist, without the upscale prices. Everything is very moderately priced considering the quality of the food, service, and atmosphere. 
I'll make sure to come in and support this business when I come back as a tourist. 
Thank you for the food, and the memories - this was the first place my partner and I went for breakfast together. 

Get the 440, by the way. It's my favorite sandwich here."}
{"text":"Great DT Vegas location with a very friendly staff, clean and trendy atmosphere. The food is fresh, healthy and so yummy! I scarfed down \"The Favorite\" which proves why it is the favorite and when I go back I am sure to get it again! Can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"I brought my mom yesterday morning with my dog to eat at Rachel's Kitchen at The District. Maybe because it was a combination amazing weather and ambiance at the restaurant, I thought this place is definitely worth updating on. 

I ordered the Grilled Vegetable & Chicken Salad with the Turkey Avocado w/Bacon Sandwich to share. The chicken was thinly cut and grilled with the perfect charred taste. My mom and I enjoyed the other grilled vegetables like the bell peppers and zucchini that came with the salad, it was really refreshing! When I ordered the sandwich, the cashier asked if I wanted 2 or 3 pieces of sourdough bread and of course being so hungry i asked for 3. The bacon slices they used were actually the thick kind, not the really thin flabby strips that you find at other sandwich stores. We sat outside with our dog and enjoyed our food with the perfect weather. 

I am really impressed how much has improved at The District, the additional parking in front of the store, additional seating, and cleanliness really makes this place such an enjoyable place. Few differences that would make me choose to eat at Rachel's Kitchen rather than Panera Bread is the friendliness of the staff, freshness of the food especially the salad, and being able to see the shops and people walk around while you are eating. Also I wanted to note is that the staff is friendlier and the wait time for your food was faster (yes it was busy) compared to the other Rachel's Kitchen locations.

Great job Rachel's Kitchen staff :)"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! Can't complain about them always being busy since their food is so good, it's worth the wait! They have the best customer service and go above and beyond to make sure I leave with a happy tummy! The place is always clean and they have clean bathrooms too (which is a huge plus)! Thank you Rachel's for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"Just left this place. There were about 3 other customers in the restaurant but no one was at the register to take my order for 2mins. I made eye contact 3 times and shouted English and Spanish to some Mexican guy whose job was to  make sandwiches  in the back.  He didnt acknowledge me or at least communicate that someone was on their way to take my order. He hid behind the little opening. The food and service is usually good here but I don't know if the 3rd string is working today WTF!"}
{"text":"Gave this place 3 honest tries. 3 different items, 2 different times of day over a month period. The food just doesn't taste that great. 

Omelette... Burnt, small portion, with frozen style cubed potatoes. 

Tuna melt... Flavorless tuna salad, and needed more salt mixed in.

Burger... I'll post a photo... If that's medium well, I'd hate to see well... Maybe if I buy enough well done patties, and put them into a trash compactor, they'll turn into man-made diamonds! Fries were limp and definitely the cheap shoestring kind (suggestion - put them in a separate breathable bag for to-go orders, so that their own humidity doesn't make them into a soggy mess) 

Pricey for this quality of food, and they probably justify it because they have a juicer behind the counter, making them a \"healthy\" place that can charge a premium. Take your money elsewhere for a better lunch or breakfast experience..."}
{"text":"I've been to the Henderson green valley ranch location several times and the food and service are always really good. However we planned on going to this location today for Togo  since it was more conveniently located to where we live and I was completely dissatisfied. My boyfriend and I ordered breakfast burritos. The breakfast burrito has sour salsa and drippy eggs in it which caused him to have food poisoning and was sick to his stomach the rest of the day. I will never go to this location ever again and now we are stuck with having stomach pains and disgust."}
{"text":"Where can I find the nutritional information? All reviews on Rachel's talk about calorie smart eating and healthy food, but I can' t seem to find the calorie content anywhere. 

Thanks!"}
{"text":"I really love Rachel's Kitchen. My go to is the chopped salad, it really is sooo good every time! I go to Rachel's often because it's fast, convenient, and really good! I will admit there have been times I've ordered things I didn't love, but overall  Rachel's is very good. I think the green tiled tables and seats make it unique and it's part of what makes it Rachel's. The service is great and the restaurant is always clean. The Summerlin location is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Ordered food for pick-up, asked to use restroom first. One of the employees left the mens room, and entered the kitchen. Not only did he leave floaters in the bowl, but the sink was bone dry. Never again."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Nothing to really rave about but it was my first time so I would definitely go back and give it another chance. They had lots of options...burgers, sandwiches, wraps, salads, smoothies. Cute little place in a nice area of town :)"}
{"text":"Listen I was living in green valley Henderson for three years and going to Rachel's in the district basically the whole time, I've tasted all the fresh juices  around the area I can even name them but won't, Rachel's is the best, I moved to the Vegas strip and crave them so here I am"}
{"text":"Food that tastes like it's homemade, but the downside is that it so cheap you actually make it yourself. You can get cheap coffee, but there's no flavored creams like vanilla. You'll be better off getting coffee from the 7/11 down the street. There's fruit smoothies are plentiful. Decent place, but be prepared for low expectations."}
{"text":"My work ordered Rachel's Kitchen for lunch one day. Prior to ordering, I called and asked about the vegan options. The person on the phone was very polite, patient and knowledgeable. He was able to answer all of my questions regarding the menu. They were able to make anything on the vegetarian menu vegan. I ended up ordering the veggie burger with a side salad. It was delicious! So tasty, but not oily or greasy. I definitely like that Rachel's Kitchen provides healthy items on the menu. I have not had a chance to eat inside the restaurant. But when I do, I will update my review."}
{"text":"Excellent meal & awesome people!!  The staff is welcoming & helpful.  Loved the Acai smoothie & bowl!!"}
{"text":"I am a preferred customer (their loyalty program) I regularly order a smoothie from here, as I work nearby. I have had their salads before as well, and although super fresh, they were nothing special.. especially for the price. I felt as if they were skimpy on the ingredients. They'll give you a large container but barely any lettuce/toppings. So I thought I would try a wrap and see if things were any different. 
Today I tried the  Caesar wrap. On the menu it is a chicken Caesar wrap, so I asked for it with no chicken, not a problem they said. 

My order was over $11!! For a Caesar salad wrap!! It was the same price as it would be if it had chicken in it! This is not a standard practice in the food industry and i would never pay this price for a simply Caesar salad wrap. 

The wrap was completely soaked in dressing that it was dripping and the wrap was beginning to get soggy. I still ate it because I was hungry and needed to get back to work, but I would never order food from here again. I'll stick to my morning smoothie."}
{"text":"Rachel's kitchen at the district in green valley ranch is a breath of fresh air. The menu is so clean and inviting. The food is modern and health conscious. I think it needs a bit of tweaking to give it that extra push to robust flavor. It is a definite spot to go if you want good food in the sea of processed giants."}
{"text":"I've walked/ driven past Rachel's Kitchen at The District or their Summerlin locations.  Their menu seems like I couldn't get a triple bypass after eating here so I never bothered giving them a try. 

After a hearty brunch at a cafe nearby, I was craving for a smoothie real bad so we went here. I normally get anything with strawberries but I wanted something with Nutella...or chocolate. They don't have anything with Nutella so, I got Peanut Butter Blast (chocolate peanut butter cups, bananas, peanut butter, chocolate milk and non-fat vanilla frozen yogurt).  I'm not a fan of chocolate peanut butter cups but if it's in smoothie form then, it's not too bad. It wasn't as thick as a smoothie should be but the taste was great. The friend got an oatmeal raisin cookie and a Sunrise smoothie (strawberries, bananas, OJ, apple juice and non-fat vanilla frozen yogurt).  The consistency was perfect and you can tell real fruits were used.  We waited about 10 minutes for our smoothies.  You can add protein powder to your smoothie for $1. The cookie was crisp and not a lot of butter was used.  That's a good thing, right?

They have lots of healthy options such as salads, turkey burger, sandwiches, wraps, soups and fresh fruit juices.  I'll definitely be back to try their wraps or sandwiches."}
{"text":"Love Rachel's kitchen.   Don't love they forgot my avocado in my chicken goat cheese wrap.   
I'll forgive you this time ;)

Rachel's is a staple at the district.  Fresh. Clean eating.  Can't get better than that.   

Tried the angel hair with meat sauce for the first time.  Delicious with fresh parm


The chicken wrap with goat cheese was delicious.   Fresh. Tender and juicy.   

Brownie.   How can you go wrong."}
{"text":"I have been to both Rachel's kitchens in town. They are both great but this location seems a bit better and has a few more options... They have a daily special which is always different if you happen to catch it on a berry salad day... Get it!!!! It is the best salad I have ever had! If not... All of there salads are delicious... You can't go wrong, huge portions, and healthy too!"}
{"text":"The food is terrific and staff is great! I have tried almost every salad and each one is delicious in it's own unique way... The only sandwich I had was the \"440\" it was okay but I would stick to the salads... I love to sit outside with my dogs and enjoy the great scene of the district..."}
{"text":"I ate here with a friend, and I plan to come back again because there are so many items on the menu that I want to try.  I had the tomato basil pasta, and it was so yummy.  The portion size was good, too, I thought (for the price) - not too much and not too little.  I like the outdoor seating option, too (though we did not take advantage of it).  The District is a beautiful place to be, so if you're in the area, stop by!  The food and the scenery are both very worthwhile."}
{"text":"I love the way they make chicken curry , very authentic with the raisins. The sweet potato fries are very good . When I am in the District , I like to eat here if I don't have a lot of time . It's very fresh and fast . The service is very friendly and accommodating ."}
{"text":"Ordered a catered breakfast for a group of 14.

The price and quality of food we received was excellent however the \"extras\" are why this review loses a star.

We had bacon, eggs, home fries and toast yet we were only proved two serving utensils (one spoon one tong). We also ordered a muffin tray that was half empty. Not full size muffins but minis, and again no serving utensils. Toast with no jelly and no add on option offered for additional fee either. 

Being that this was a breakfast being taken to our clients we needed the \"extras\" to be on point. It's a bit embarrassing when our clients are searching their own office kitchen to find items to serve our catered breakfast."}
{"text":"And now... for my 500th Yelp review! Congrats, Rachel's Kitchen! 

I was so excited to hear that there was a Rachel's coming to this part of Henderson! While I love the District, this area is so much more practical for shopping and errands. This location is off the lobby of the Hilton Garden Inn. There's a beautiful fenced off outdoor area with tons of seating. The inside is bright and spacious, and so comfortable compared to the other locations. Nice plush booths and great tables and chairs. So much cozier than the iron chairs with the dirty seat cushions and the tile top tables at the District. 

The staff were very friendly, but there were some hiccups with our order. They graciously offered us a pastry while we waited and corrected all the issues appropriately. The owner helped me grab a high chair, which was nice because my hands were full. 

The food was delicious, as always. We have the Rachel's reward card, so we got a BOGO meal today. Make sure to get one of these cards if you dine here often, as the rewards rack up nicely. We often get rewarded with a free smoothie or meal. 

There's also a small bar area in this restaurant, which I think serves as the lobby bar to the hotel. There was loud cheering when a game was on, so don't be surprised if this turns out to be a mini sports bar LOL. 

My biggest suggestion would be to make sure changing tables getting added into both the women's and men's bathrooms if they want to be completely family friendly. I understand it's a hotel lobby primarily, but it's now also a family friendly eatery and there needs to be a place to change the little ones. 

Will be back often!"}
{"text":"I've been here a zillion times and never reviewed... that's crazy to me! I come to Rachel's so often craving their Chinese Chicken Salad and the Rachel's Chicken Salad Sandwich. Breakfast is good and is served all day. I love their juices and smoothies, too. I feel like portions for stuff like their sides of fries vary. Sometimes I get a handful, and sometimes I get a plateful. No rhyme or reason. The lines are so freaking long so much of the time, and the seating against the wall is so darn uncomfortable. If you sign up for their \"preferred guest\" program you'll eventually rack up free meals, and occasionally get random freebies like coffee, smoothies, etc. There's a check-in for a free glass of wine."}
{"text":"I had RK for the first time on Saturday. My co workers and I (all 6 of us ordered online) it was so awesome. We came in they had our food ready, didnt have to wait."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Rachel's Kitchen for over 10 years and will continue. They have been a Summerlin go to spot for years. Although I miss their old location up the street on Town Center I still go to the current location on Hualapai. The food here is pretty tasty. Looking for breakfast? Well I would say try the \"Protein Lover's\" or \"The Favorite\" I also like the Granola and Fresh Squeezed Juices. If you're looking lunch try one of the salads, sandwiches or wraps. My choice in salad is the Arugula Pear. The Smoked Turkey Avocado is my go to sandwich and the BBQ Chicken Wrap is always good. When it comes to Pasta you have to try the \"Signiture Pasta\" it's very good. The food has always been consistent over the years and you have plenty to choose from, including quite a few healthy selections!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here with my family. The atmosphere was great, the staff was friendly, but the food is honestly mediocre. I had the breakfast wrap, which was nothing special. Pretty much your basic breakfast wrap. It tasted like something I could've made at home and save money.

The potatoes however were magical. Perfectly crispy and warm. I just wish the ketchup added something special, but nah it's just your good ol' basic ketchup.

I also had the juice Popeyes Special, which contained apples, spinach and other fruits/veggies, but it tasted like sweetened dirt. It wasn't pleasant to me at all. But if you're into wheat grass juices, you might enjoy it.

We ate outside because it was only 9:30AM but it started getting really hot. It would've been nice if there was mist or something to help cool the customers who want to eat outside. But maybe that's the District's problem and not Rachel's Kitchen.

Overall, I would probably come back to try other menu options because their menu is pretty big! Hopefully I will be more impressed next time."}
{"text":"I know it's going to be a good day when we make a Rachel's Kitchen visit. Gourmet sandwiches & wraps really just hit the spot. You can customize them too with your own choice of bread and side! Pretty awesome if you ask me. Here are some of my favorites:

Curry Chicken Salad Sandwich- An amazing twist on your regular chicken salad. I love spices, and this sandwich definitely is full of them. Hubby has to put up with my curry breath after I eat one of these lol.

BBQ Chicken Wrap- The secret behind this wrap is the onion rings! They go so well with the bbq grilled chicken and romaine lettuce. It's served on a green spinach wrap which helps all the ingredients come together (literally!).

Rachel's Chicken Salad Sandwich- Reminds me of my mom's homemade chicken salad, and anything that reminds me of her food is always delicious! This is Hubby's personal favorite, but I love it too. Apples & grapes are a great addition to chicken salad.

Whatever you do decide to order, you seriously can't go wrong here. Everything tastes so fresh and wholesome. The best part is that they use all natural & 100% hormone free chicken breast! Their baked goods are also made fresh daily. For a yummy treat, get an Incredible Hulk Smoothie. Bananas, peanut butter, soft silken tofu, milk, and honey all blended together... You can thank me later. :)"}
{"text":"I have finally tried Rachel's Kitchen again, but at this location.  Usually I went to the Henderson location because I used to live near there, but now this location is literally down the street from my house.

I went here with my mom and we were not too impressed.  The workers are ever so friendly and we took our time trying to order because my mom didn't know what to get.  But we ordered the Chicken Alfredo pasta, the tuna sandwich, and I believe I got the peanut butter and something smoothie.

We received our order and my mom tasted her tuna sandwich and she hated it.  My chicken Alfredo was good and I liked it, I would definitely  order it again if I ever chose to come back here.

However, what really gets me is the prices for the food.  I cant help think how expensive they are.  All three items cost me about $36! All i kept thinking was I could have gone to M buffet. LOL. 

With that being said, the place is nice, has a lot of space, and it has a cute out-door eating area."}
{"text":"I have only been to Rachel's Kitchen no more than five times. 

I have mix reviews about this whether if I should give it a four star or a three star.  Then I settled with a three-star because after tasting several of their food by munching off with my friends and my food.  I believe their food quality is mediocre and the price for the food, I believe is a little too over-priced.

I recently went to Rachel's Kitchen and ordered a Turkey Club Sandwich and the price was a little over $10 or $11.  For the taste of the food was not worth it.  I'd rather walk further and went to panera bread instead.  

With that being said, I am no hurry to come back to Rachel's Kitchen, i would try other options first.  

TIP: Check-in to rachel's kitchen and get $3 off mimosa on sundays :]"}
{"text":"A quick bite before doing errands can land you in a pinch and with a belly full of fast food. Instead of the drive thru, I opted to go into Rachel's Kitchen to get a wrap and a smoothie. The use of mayo in the wrap could be lessened, or cut out, but otherwise the food was good. The smoothies are on the sweet side. The use of frozen yogurt makes the drink more of a dessert than a meal supplement. Getting the Acaiberry smoothie without made all the difference. 

The employees are always helpful and friendly. The initial greeting once you walk through the door sets the pace. They gave me time to look over the menu, but was ready to when I stepped forward. 

The menu is broad and takes some time to navigate, but with a few modifications the food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I love Rachel's Kitchen, but this location has terrible service. I ordered online for a 6:10 pick up. Arrived at 6:10, the restaurant had 1 other person in it, and my salad wasn't ready. I ordered two more entrees while I waited. And waited. And waited. 4 other people came in, ordered, and were served while I sat there. After 45 minutes, our food was done. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"A little pricier than I'd like, but non meat options are often times far and few. Also, the alternative to the regular bun was just plain wheat toast. 

I ordered a grilled garden burger, which I thought was pretty good, but not particularly special.  The patty on this one looked like it had quinoa mixed with the other vegetables, which was cool, but I was sooo hungry, I felt like there was barely any patty! Cereallly, that patty is like so thin. Anyhow, the avocado added to the sandwich was an awesome idea! Avocados over everything. Every sandwich comes with a choice of salad, fries, or sweet potato fries.  I got the sweet potato fries, which were also good...as normal? They're pretty hard to mess up lol. But maybe I'm a hefty eater, I just thought the portions were small. Oh, I also purchased the Triple Berry Smoothie! (See?? So famished!) And I thought it was refreshing and not overly sweet. I also appreciate that they can omit the yogurt. 

All in all, decent lunch spot. Prices range from about $8 up (my 16oz smoothie was $6), and I thought that the portions could have been larger considering the price tag, but that's just me.  I will probably return as they are in the neighborhood of my usual whereabouts if I tire of the my regular go-to's."}
{"text":"I ordered half sald but it was still big.  My daughter had tomato soup, it was excellent.  To order food at the counter, all staff are friendly and nice.  We loved there."}
{"text":"Got catering service delivered! Service was definitely fast and efficient. Their tuna wrap and chicken sandwich were scrumptious! The salad was fresh and the dressing was very light and tasty."}
{"text":"I was looking for a coffee place with breakfast burritos and found Rachel's Kitchen. Bonus: their menu is so plenty of options for me.
The people behind the counter were friendly, helpful, and welcoming, and the atmosphere in general was relaxing. My impression was that the team behind  cares very much about creating an experience that their customers will love, and that was certainly how it was for me. Fantastic food, it seems like everything is made from scratch.
Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place's smoothies are amazing! The workers were nice and cooperative. The smoothies were a healthy and decently priced alternative to the other fast food restaurants. And a huge plus was that they had vegan options. You can just tell the workers to change some of the ingredients and they'll happily oblige. 

After drinking the horrible tasting smoothies at Juice Express, I wish I knew about this place earlier before experiencing bad service from there. If you're traveling to Las Vegas and going through the airport, check this place out! Tip from a common traveler"}
{"text":"Expensive for how plain the food was. I was pretty disappointed. Got the tomato basil scramble... Nothing special. Could have saved some $ and made it better at home"}
{"text":"This place is amazing  to get good healthy menu selection in town. The food are delicious! Everything on the menu is amazing. I have no  complain withbtgere menu. Also, the staff there are friendly, helpful, and professional what they do. They were able to help me with my orders when I could decide what to order. I would recommend this place to my friends and family. Come check out Rachel's kitchen. You won't be disappointed with the service and food...."}
{"text":"Had wanted to try out Wild next door but it doesn't open until 11 am. Rachel's kitchen had a great menu with lots of options though! Everything seemed fresh and they had lots of healthy options.

I opted for \"the favorite\" omelette and Justin got the BLT sandwich with egg and fries.

The omelette was awesome- I loved the mixture of sundried tomatoes, avocado, goat cheese and shrooms! The homefries were lacking- they seemed to be the store bought kind. Justin enjoyed his BLT also!  We also ordered the berry smoothie.  It was made with frozen yogurt instead of soy milk which made it creamy and frozen!

I also had an iced coffee with soy milk but it wasn't the best.... Too much soy milk and the coffee had grounds in it that settled to the bottom.

They currently have an awesome yelp deal for half off any alcohol. Woohoo! Great way to attract customers! Unfortunately, we had to road trip afterwards so no mimosa with my brunch!

I was glad we came in before the lunch rush- this place seemed like the place to be!  Definitely worth trying out for fresh food worth the prices!"}
{"text":"This place is good!!! I love restaurants with healthy options and this is one of them. I don't like that they serve cheap fruit. Melon and a 2 grapes is not really my idea of \"A side of fruit\" that's pretty much just a side of melon. 

P.S. Can't wait to try a burger here. They looked pretty good!!"}
{"text":"I have always liked the food at Rachel's kitchen, however for the third time in a row I experienced VERY poor service. I work about 5 minutes away. Waited half an hour for my salad to come out. When I walked up to the counter, it was sitting there. I asked to take it and was promptly told it would be brought to me. Almost 10 minutes later, it was brought to our table. I asked the young lady if I could get a to-go box as I no longer had time to eat at the restaurant. My request was forgotten, a few minutes later my boyfriend went up the counter to get a to-go box for our salads. REALLY disappointed! Normally I would consider this a fluke, however, this is becoming a trend. Consistently awful service, regardless of the food makes it difficult to come back to this location. Hopefully, management reads some of these reviews and does an assessment on related staff."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. Everything was so fresh and tasty. Just perfect for a relaxing, healthy breakfast at a great price. Highly recommend the French toast and breakfast burrito. Sounds like a heavy breakfast, but it was perfectly portioned. Yum! Two thumbs up on the fresh juice too."}
{"text":"Had trouble placing order with the website. So called it in.  Walked in, paid, walked out.  Loved the ultimate grilled cheese with sweet potato fries as a side....love, love, love.  Always made to perfection.  Some day, I will have to try some of the other breakfast items.  I'm sure they are all good."}
{"text":"Only been there two times but I love their food. A little pricey but it's good and quick :) first time I got the Mac and cheese and it was a good size portion! Really rich but was really good. It had onions and mushrooms in it but you can substitute stuff and add bacon! Next time I'm going to try it with bacon. This time I had the breakfast burrito with potatoes. It was delicious !!! I love it! Had avocado and salsa and Swiss cheese and eggs in it! The potatoes were pretty good too. I also got the sunrise smoothie, which I really liked that too. Definitely a good spot for a quick breakfast/lunch. It all seems really healthy too. The salads look amazing! I'll have to try those next :)"}
{"text":"This place is great the food is always fresh and I love to sit outside when the weather is nice. I thought I would not like the new district with the parking but it was not as bad as I thought. Go for lunch or brunch you are sure to enjoy this place"}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and found my new favorite breakfast place. The food was delicious and the staff is happy and helpful. Great place in my new neighborhood!  Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went to Rachel's kitchen late Thursday night. I ordered some eggs which were delicious. Then I started on my salad. Out came some kind of bug. Obviously I was not going to eat the salad. I will inform my adult students about what happened. Friends will here about it. It's a shame that the people in Rachel's Kitchen were not more careful. I want clean food."}
{"text":"Took too long...we just ordered a juice. They messed up 1st time and had to make another. I have a nutribullet and make all my blends with it. I much prefer the pulp/fiber in my drink. Ill stick to making my home blends....good for those that don't like to buy produce and make your own creations. But it's cheaper to just buy your own anyway...."}
{"text":"Very tasty. I went for bring with some friends and had the breakfast burrito with bacon added. I can't usually eat a full burrito so I asked if they could only use two eggs, this was a great choice because it was still a big meal! Potatoes on the side were fluffy inside crispy outside. Great food, not the fastest service since it wasn't very full. 

I will definitely return here."}
{"text":"Good selection of fresh food. We had the Smoked Turkey on Ciabatta bread and BBQ chicken wrap. Both were really good."}
{"text":"I usually go to the one at the district, but my first experience here was great. Very nice customer service and great options. I enjoy the mushroom burger and chicken Caesar salad. Great place :)"}
{"text":"I'm always down for a lunch date at Rachel's kitchen! It's a favorite spot of mine to meet friends and enjoy a meal that doesn't mean indulgence overload.

Food: there's a wide selection of fresh juice, wraps, and sandwiches and the like. You can grab larger meal and a glass of wine if that's your thing that day or you can get a small juice and a salad if you're wanting something lighter. I LOVE the pear arugula salad and add chicken to it - thank me later!

Service: everyone at Rachel's kitchen is super friendly. The service is consistent from the person who takes my order to the one who brings my food. They always are accommodating with adjustments to meals.

Environment: situated in the District on Green Valley, RK has areas inside and out to enjoy time with friends and family over a meal or quick bite. When the weather is amazing, outdoor seating is limited because of the nice atmosphere on the patio. There's never shortage of places to sit inside either. 

I'm a fan. I come here a lot. They take all of my money for that pear arugula salad."}
{"text":"I went into Rachel's kitchen and tried to order an omelet without any of the sides associated with the meal - no bread and potatoes. Joe, the cashier, told me this would be no problem. When I started to order toppings, he told me they would be extra. I asked Joe to clarify - what I was ordering then was just scrambled eggs? Joe said that was right: it was scrambled eggs. 

So I ordered scrambled eggs (topped with cheese) and coffee - but was charged the same price ($9.95) as if I ordered the omelet with both sides and 3 toppings. When I protested, Joe look flustered. After a few minutes of fidgeting, Joe reached out to his manager for help - but I was so over it by that point I just walked out. 

This is not cheap food. The customer service here is beneath what one would experience at cheaper places - like Chipotle - and a lot worse than IHOP, where the omelets are cheaper. In a word, it sucks. 

I will not be visiting another Rachel's if I can avoid it. This once fresh and great brand has fallen on hard times because of complacency. Sad."}
{"text":"Very nice establishment. It is really clean and quiet. There is an outside patio as well which is a nice addition. The food was fantastic, I had the garden pasta and a vanilla pear muffin (which I got free by checking in on yelp!). They were delicious and tasted very fresh. I have used them for catering as well and everyone loves it! Definitely worth checking out especially if you are trying to eat a little healthier!"}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times. We pre-order their food for occasional meetings at the office. Every time I arrive to pick up our order, I have to stand in a long line. Why don't they have a 'Pickup Only' window? 

When it's finally your turn, you're foods not even ready. Even though, you ordered it hours ago. So now you get to stand off to the side in a separate line with other irate customers. 

When you do get your food, it's disappointing. By the time I get back to the office (which is right next door), the food is at room temperature. They should consider wrapping things in foil before putting them in boxes. Or use better containers. They had my burger in one of those eco-friendly fold up boxes. Hooray for saving the environment. 'Boooo' for me. 

Today I arrived and miraculously there was no line. I stood there like a moron though, while workers stared from behind the counter, but said nothing. Awkward. Finally a short girl greeted us after making eye contact several times and saying nothing for a moment. It was a very listless greeting, like someone who just really hated their job. They gave me my order, then I left. When I got back to the office, guess what? Room temperature food. I ordered a mushroom cheeseburger with onion rings. They gave me three onion rings. Three. I get that's it's a place for health conscious people, but really? If you're going to serve some not-so-healthy onion rings, then at least offer the standard 5 or 6 in my meal. Also, who puts mushrooms over the cheese? And really. . . Diced lettuce? The burger overall was puny, rubbery, and cold. The onion rings were cold.  

I will say this though. . . they have some really good smoothies. Only thing worth getting so far."}
{"text":"I like Rachel's food, but they're very stingy. I ordered the chicken sandwich and fries for lunch. After taxes and delivery fees I paid almost $20 to get a handful of fries. It's a wonder why people end up at fast food places. They pay $5 and get enough food to fill them up..."}
{"text":"Great burger & sweet potato fries. Also had great service today from Dakota. Even brought my little one a yogurt parfait. Will be back."}
{"text":"Vegas is very far behind on the health train, so Rachel's Kitchen is great for the area. My only gripe is the lack of different flavors on the menu, and the price...my egg white omelette with avocado and fresh fruit cost $15. And also, there is no green juice or smoothie on the menu.

But negativity aside, healthy places are a necessity around here and Rachel's gets the job done."}
{"text":"Met some friends for lunch and had a wonderful time. The food at Rachel's kitchen was excellent. We had the mushroom cheeseburger and the Chinese chicken salad. Rochelle the counter girl was very friendly and the GM Elizabeth came by our table to make sure everything was great...which it was."}
{"text":"The staff is extremely friendly and their customer service is excellent. The acai berry smoothie is perfect and they have a peanut butter smoothie that has the perfect blend of ingredients. They also have one of the best turkey burgers in town."}
{"text":"I saw a friend post a picture of her food from here and it looked delicious. My boyfriend ordered a caesar wrap and I got the signature pasta. The wrap with fries was delicious. Perfect price for its size. The pasta had some flaws though. Super saucy and not enough cheese. And it's took forever for us to get our food!!! We were about to go up and complain but right then we got our food. Customer service was swell which helped me forget about my meh pasta and long waiting. If you're in the area then I would recommend Rachel's kitchen, otherwise it's not a place you would go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Love the food, service and rewards program with my  preferred guest card. I eat everything on the menu and juices are awesome.  I never noticed any music in the place  to be annoying so I'm not sure what the other person was talking about. I highly recommend it you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Equivalent to cafeteria food. I was the only one in the restaurant and placed a to-go order of a cheese burger and angel-hair bolognese. I was very disappointed when I got home. This place should be called Rachel's Cafeteria because it reminds me of the food they served us in the High School cafeteria."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is yummy and service is excellent! The albacore tuna sandwich was delicious."}
{"text":"I had a work breakfast here this week, and was really pleased by everything that was ordered up.  For starters, everything just tasted fresh and like it was made right then.  Their fruit was (surprisingly for me) the biggest highlight, as everything just tasted good, and wasn't mushy like some fruit selections can be.

Their breakfast wraps were also really great, with a few varieties mixed in there, and each tasted great, as did their french toast bread sticks.  The lady who brought everything was incredibly nice, and made sure that we had everything we needed and then some.

Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience, and a nice way to break up a busy morning of work.  I'd like to go back and try it when I have a little more free time, but the initial impression was healthy, fresh, and delicious, which is ideal for me as I'm trying for 1015 (fingers crossed) to eat a little more responsibly.  But at least it is close to work, so I can perhaps try them during one of my lunch breaks for a burger or sandwich."}
{"text":"This place has been good so far. A better choice of eating offered. I will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen in the District at Green Valley Ranch is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas.  Like many things in life, you get what you pay for.  If all I wanted was filler meal for $5, I might settle for a sub.  Rachel's is nothing of the sort.  

I had the much reviewed 440 sandwich.  A quick list of the ingredients including the red pepper and goat cheese indicate the excellence.  I am a big eater and found the sandwich and onion rings quite satisfying.  

Jessica had Arugula Pear salad.  She enjoyed it very much.  I tried it too and found it to be of a high quality.  We shared an excellent smoothie made of nice fruit ingredients.  

The location in Green Valley is excellent with nice outdoor seating.  Many dog people found it to be an accommodating atmosphere too.  All in all, I highly recommend Rachel's Kitchen for a top notch lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I know I will get lynched for this, but I was very, very disappointed by this place. My number one issue? Premade veggie patties. Factory grade. For seven bucks? No. This place boasts healthy choices, but doesn't make its own veggie burger? I myself stay away from them because they are full of soy and sodium, and I hate, HATE seeing them on a menu anywhere. But whatever, they have other things here that look great.

So I got the Breakfast Ultimate Grilled Cheese. Most certainly not the most ultimate grilled cheese I have ever had. The bread was soaked in grease, and the cheese was not good. It had small tasteless tomatoes on it that didn't add to the flavor at all. The only thing I enjoyed off that plate was the potatoes. 

I also got a Peanut Butter Blast smoothie that was pretty darn good, though not very peanutty, still very refreshing.

Perhaps I just order the wrong thing, but really as far as veggie alternatives, they are quite lacking. Maybe it is just this location, Downtown, but I was left baffled at this supposedly great healthy place."}
{"text":"I am visiting from California and we came in to Rachel's after a baseball tournament and the salads are amazing.  They use all fresh ingredients and the grilled chicken is all natural and so good.
Loved it!! Will definitely be back before I leave. 
Wish we had a Rachel's kitchen in the OC."}
{"text":"What can tell you, Rachel's Kitchen is the best. The chicken wrap in my opinion is the best around and the their smoothies are awesome."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a Saturday breakfast here. The chocolate chip pancakes and huevos rancheros were delicious. The Hawaiian smoothie was ine of the best I'd ever have. Nice local spot to grab a fresh meal"}
{"text":"Very good.  I loved the Turkey Club sandwich.  The Incredible Hulk was somewhat misleading.  For whatever reason, we expected it to be green and not taste like peanut butter.  

But overall, the food was great and the staff was very friendly.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Cafe is tucked into a nice corner of the shopping center. Really nice atmosphere and very clean. Staff is helpful and friendly and they do deliver your food to the table if you are eating in. I ordered the chicken Caesar wrap with fries. Food was very good. I can taste the quality in the ingredients. Chicken was very tasty and the dressing tasted homemade. Big wrap and good amount of food also. You get what you pay for. I would recommend this place and was very satisfied with my visit as being my first time here."}
{"text":"Discovered this little gem thanks to a good friend of mine. The location appears to be extremely small and cramped inside, but the beauty of being in The District is that you can eat outside when the weather permits and they bring your order outside to you.

As a vegetarian, they do have a few choices for me. There's the Vegetarian Gourmet Sandwich and the Ultimate Grilled Cheese. They also have a Grilled Garden Burger but as a creature of habit, I always get the Vegetarian Gourmet Sandwich. I love the way that it is prepared and the veggies are always super fresh, juicy and delicious! I am also a big fan of their fries! :) Next time I visit, I have to get out of my comfort zone and try the grilled cheese or the burger. Both sound really good!

I'd recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a good sandwich. I also found out by accident that there's one just five minutes from my house in Summerlin. Have to hit that location here really soon. The only downside outside of it being pretty small inside is that it is a little pricey, in my opinion. But it's worth it."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. I ordered my pasta and sat down. There was only one other couple in the restaurant so after waiting about 20 minutes I started wondering where my food was. I saw the cook showing the cashier my ticket and asked if he still needed it. They obviously forgot about me. I was furious. I asked them to make it Togo. Ten minutes later it was done. This is the second time I have had a bad experience here. I will not return. It's a shame because the food is really good"}
{"text":"Today's lunch choice was Rachel's Kitchen and let me say... It was like eating a Julia Childs meal without all the butter and well without anything like Julia Childs would make.... It was awesome and healthy.

We have decided at work to order nothing but good foods for now on and the first choice was Rachels Kitchen. I Personally had the \"440\" This amazing mound of goodness has the following ingredients:

Grilled Chicken Breast 
Goat Cheese
Avocado
Roasted Red Peppers 
Roasted Tomatoes
Romain Lettuce. 
On a crispy chibatta roll with a fresh salad with a balsamic vinaigrette

As you can see, No mayo or any sauces but between the goat cheese and avocado you do not need it. 

For those of you that know me, I am not a huge sandwich person and this was one heck of a sandwich. I would invite ole Rachel into my place any day to come whip up one of these bad boys!!

Another plus was that the entire order was made to perfection No mistakes and not just sloppily through in boxes like some other places we order from. Knowing that this is the first time we have ventured into our new healthy options folder, I think Rachels will be a consistent part of our lunch schedule especially since the menu seems to offer tons of healthy alternatives to a Double Double heart stopper or a quick Cardiac quesadilla!!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Surrounded by unhealthy choices all over at the airport, this place is a breather. I tried their Acai berry smoothie and the extra zing of pineapple made it taste amazing."}
{"text":"I usually love Rachel's kitchen because of the food, location Etc but I think they need to remove the French toast off their breakfast menu. first off, I'm all for the nontraditional French toast... but it didn't taste special. they used some kind of thick French bread cut too thick .. and barely dipped in egg wash and milk. there was no flavor and the fruit was not ripe... 

if I wanted to eat less than mediocre, I would've just eaten at the drive through McDonald's, which the pancakes are to die for compared to their French toast. 

banana chocolate chip pancakes are amazing though! big shout out to the hubby for ordering it otherwise I would've starved!!!! sorry Rachel's kitchen but take the French toast off the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Got the tomato soup and salad and both were good. The hubs didn't like what he got though. I felt the prices were a little high for what you get. I would definitely go back and try something else. The staff were friendly and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"Absolute love Rachel's Kitchen! I also love that it is 3 minutes away from the hubby's work, which makes it easy thinking of where to go for a mid-day date...aka lunch break. 

However, I can only base my review on the items we order/have ordered. A Caesar salad is not the healthiest of choice when it comes to salads...but by gosh there are leaves in it for crying out loud--healthy enough! I am an absolute Caesar salad finatic and a huge critic. When ever we frequent Rachel's I opt for the Caesar chicken wrap. Honestly, one of the best Caesar wraps I've had, thus far. Gosh knows how much Caesar wraps I've explored. 

I love that it isn't dripping in sauce and that all the ingredients taste fresh and crispy. My husband thinks their chicken is a tad dry, but I absolutely love it. I don't think it's as dry as he thinks. The chicken used are hormone free, free ranged chicken...even better! There are different wraps to choose from (wheat, flour, spinach...), but if you don't special request your wrap of choice don't expect them to ask unless it is an actual option for that item. 

Their wraps come with a choice of French fries, sweet potatoe fries, onion rings, or kettle chips. I'm about the ying and the  yang...I'm already eating something healthy, drop me some french fries. Their fries are portioned small, not greasy, and more on the skinny side. I like 'em anyway. 

We've also had their bbq chicken wrap which is definitely good as well! Same thing, not soggy, fresh vegetables, no overwhelming amount of sauce in the wrap and pretty tasty. 

You can actually turn their salads/sandwiches into a wrap as well. My husband did this for their Rachel's chicken salad. It was deeeelish!!! It's a chicken salad but with grapes and apples diced in there! Definitely recommend you trying that as well.

I only have tried their smoothies once. Twas the sunrise. It was a little on the disappointing side because it was a little watery. Not even smoothie like at all. One day I may try a smoothie out again, but I only go for their wraps so then again...maybe not. That'll be a mood. 

I personally don't like bringing the whole family here because it's basically like 10/11 bucks per person. My boys end up hungry an hour later. They're typical filipinos who need their rice + ______ to feel satisfied. The husband and I...we're usually good. I mean, you are eating here with a purpose so you should know going in that you will probably be hungry an hour later. Hahahhaa. 

I would certainly recommend trying the place out especially if you are health conscious or on the road to weight watching. I love that when you dine-in they don't serve your food on paper plates (I don't have anything against paper plates whatsoever). Seeing your huge serving of salad in a real bowl just looks classier. They do offer vegeterian options and you can certainly request changes to your meal to make it vegan friendly if applicable. We don't have much places, if any, in the northwest side of such type of business to size them up to another location. Fortunately for them.

Note: it's best to try them dining-in first. If you order out and have a ways drive, your fries will sog and your wrap will start diluting the sauce...you may not get a good first impression that way. Unless, you plan on eating it to-go  in the next 5-10 minutes after buying it.

Definitely kid and stroller friendly!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots, but decided to come for dinner. Great turkey burger. Great service. 

Minus one star because the acai bowl was 3/4 granola and 1/4 acai and starwberries. That was the only disappointment."}
{"text":"This is a recommended lunch place as they have a variety of sandwiches, wraps, burgers, and pastas.  The prices are about on par with their quality (about 8-12 dollars a meal), so there are no surprises there.  The only thing I would be aware of is that the location is a little small so they have few tables - which are also small.  However if you can stand the heat (or it isn't summer) there is plenty of seating outside.  The food is good and there is enough variety on the menu to keep you coming back to try something else.  I plan to go back several more times."}
{"text":"Seems dumb that they have a high protein but also high carb meal.  It would be great if they would give you the option for a veggie or fruit for no additional charge since I end up throwing out the bread and pototaoes.  +12 bucks already seems really high for just meal and a coffee.....feels like they should have more healthy meal options for breaksfast."}
{"text":"Delish! Everything I've every had there has been really good, fresh salads and wraps to my kids PB&J. I find it annoyingly busy during lunch hours so when I go I plan to go early or later. Mimosas on Sunday while listening to jazz outside. The district doesn't have that much going on but this place makes it a worthwhile destination. I do agree with some other reviewers that it is a tad overpriced."}
{"text":"Really good clean food with great customer service - I absolutely will be back here when in the area"}
{"text":"I ordered two breakfast burritos and an acai smoothie to the travel lodge by the circus circus.
The food was delicious! The delivery lady was very nice and delivered the food about 15 minutes before the expected delivery time. Definitely recommend and will be ordering from here when we come to Vegas again."}
{"text":"Great spot with delicious food,
Friendly staff and good vibe.
The pasta Alfredo is delicious!
Their free wine is a great perk too, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. 
Outdoor seating when the weather is nice.
Polite customer service.

Gotta love a place that offers military discount 10%!

The food is always fresh and made to order. Needed something light so a wrap was our choice.

We did a Yelp ck in and got a free glass of wine, that is amazing! 

The only draw back is the order took a while to come out but it tasted good so I still gave them 5 stars. 
Places like this are better than fast food!"}
{"text":"Best customer service ever!!! Abby and Adrian were MORE THAN helpful. . I was STARVING & never been here before... so many things on the menu, starving to the point where I didn't feel like reading the whole thing just wanted food inside me lol i told them what i was craving, but was also on a diet.. they gave me exactly what I was wanted!! 
Something as simple as customer service totally just made my day! 
Thank you both!"}
{"text":"Our go to spot for a quick and high quality meal. Awesome burgers, wraps, salads, and sweet potato fries and a much better option than most fast food places!!!"}
{"text":"Great. A real surprise and delight for an airport carry-out stand! Everything is very fresh, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find Rachel's Kitchen at the airport! In a sea of fried food and pre-packaged questionable looking sandwiches, a healthy option was exactly what I wanted after a week in Las Vegas. Rachel's had a great variety of smoothies, sandwiches, salads, and healthy snacks available. I grabbed a spinach salad for my plane ride-- it was topped with fresh mushrooms, tomatoes, goat cheese, and bacon with an herb vinaigrette and was fresh and actually really tasty. I wouldn't have even known that it was airport food! Will definitely be looking for Rachel's on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I experienced Rachel's Kitchen for the first time tonight since it opened in our building. I ordered the turkey sandwich and my wife got the chicken caesar wrap. The turkey sandwich was good but it wasn't anything amazing and definitely not worth the hefty price tag for a regular  turkey sandwich with some avocado. Its something that can definitely be made at home. my wife said that the chicken caesar was ok but nothing impressive either. It really makes me dissappointed because I feel like there aren't many good restaurants downtown yet that aren't located in a casino or for the ones that are great they have limited hours. This place also has limited hours.. it closes at 7pm on weekdays and 8pm on fridays and saturdays. overall not impressed."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent customer service. Shout out to Yesina and Karen. Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute worst! I have given it a fair chance 2 times now and both times it's been awful. the burger was overpriced and tasted bad. Strike 1, today the smoothie I ordered made my stomach cramp up something serious! Either it's a nasty kitchen back there or the preparations are not sanitary. Get it together Rachel's kitchen!! Awful, wouldn't recommend it to anyone!!"}
{"text":"I must say, I was kind of disappointed when I actually saw the restaurant from the outside, but once I was in my perception was quickly reversed. I ate breakfast Sunday morning and it was so fast. I had enough time to make my coffee, sit down and boom there was my food. Extremely skeptical due to the speed but it was amazingly delicious, the avocados were very fresh and everything was cooked to perfection, even the toast! 5 of 5, may eat here every Sunday for the rest of ever!"}
{"text":"My company catered with Rachel's kitchen for two weeks and it was delicious every day !!"}
{"text":"Glad I tried this place out.  I had heard it was good but always got the impression it was a vegetarian type restaurant.  Not so!  On my two trips I have had an excellent burger and a pretty tasty turkey wrap.  They have a very varied menu including soups, salads, burgers, and even some alcohol.  Glad this place opened so close to my office!  It should be a weekly visit.  The prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great-tasting fresh food that is served by young professional and extremely nice employees, this is your place. During our many visits to this location we repeatedly received an outstanding service from Corbin, Khalani, and Grant. These guys always make our experience pleasant and enjoyable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Service from Justin was quick and friendly.  Food was fresh and tasty.  Coffee was great!  Parking was a little challenging until we drove around. Look for parking when you get a few blocks away."}
{"text":"I love this location! I usually order them to go through grubhub and my kids love their grilled cheeses. my husband and I usually get the smoked turkey and avocado. It's our fav! Every time I've come in for a lunch date by myself or with friends. The staff is super friendly :) Vanessa was my cashier last time I went and was very polite."}
{"text":"Consistently good food in a casual relaxed atmosphere.  The food is fresh and well prepared by a friendly staff. A wide variety of foods are available from salads, chicken salad sandwiches, burgers and wraps.  

The sides range from fries, sweet potato fries, fruit, etc......  This is just an honest place with good food that I enjoy going to. Two thumbs up and four stars."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The staff is sweet and welcoming and the menu looks amazing! The Incredible Hulk smoothie is incredibly delicious! My new favs!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The bacon & eggs with country potatoes was excellent!  Plus any place that has a turn table & a bunch of records is my kind of place.  They were playing The Beatles when I walked in:)  I will definitely be back next time I'm in Sin City:)"}
{"text":"I'm absolutely in love with the food here and not to mention its great location! The food is so fresh and there is something for everyone --salads, breakfast, pasta, sandwiches and a great selection of smoothies and juices. The staff is also extremely friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Great smoothie for breakfast after a night of gambling and drinking.  Very refreshing and hydrating. I had the Wilshire smoothie hubby had the Hawaiian bliss and a macchiato.  Great pick me ups."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  I've never had something I didn't like. I always feel good after eating here. But come hungry because they offer healthy portions too! You can't go wrong with their signature salad or chicken salad sandwich."}
{"text":"The newest location is right next to my gym, so I'm a happy camper.  I love their oatmeal with strawberries and bananas, a great post-workout meal paired with iced green tea.  There's something on the menu for everyone.  Great service, great food, great googly-moogly.  Happy New Year!"}
{"text":"Rachel's is a reliable establishment for delicious, fresh food.  I had breakfast here yesterday with a couple of friends after a bike ride through Red Rock and we weren't disappointed with our meal.  The new, bigger location is great to accommodate all of the regulars who started to pack in after we arrived around 11:00am.  Among the three of us, we had the Ultimate Grilled Cheese sandwich, the Breakfast Burrito, and a spinach, mushroom, and Swiss cheese omelet.  The food was delectable as usual and I especially enjoyed the refreshing iced green tea that they offer (my bladder was working overtime to keep up with the multiple refills).  I only wish Rachel's offered hash browns because I'm not a big fan of the seasoned potatoes, but beggars can't be choosers.  Great service, good food--we'll keep coming back for more, just like all of the other Rachel's fans."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen, the Sequel, is just as good as the original on my side of town.  I appreciate having one that's located right down the road from my workplace in Hendertucky.  Fresh, healthy, wholesome food is certainly on the menu, but if you're like me, you go for the artery-clogging Ultimate Grilled Cheese sandwich.  Hey, I had sweet potato fries instead of the other, evil kind, so that's got to be a little redeeming, right?  Anyway, I don't feel guilty--it was GOOD and I enjoyed every bite.  I also liked the fact that when I checked in on Yelp, I had the option of receiving a FREE cookie or muffin--I LOVE free things!  I'll be back and maybe I'll order something with green vegetables...or not."}
{"text":"Able to eat clean here.     I like their breakfast burrito, Turkey avocado sandwich and their soups.    Customer service better depending on locations.   Little pricey on some items."}
{"text":"The  Breakfast burrito, Turkey n avocado sandwich w/salad n lemon poppy muffin was well made, good quality, tasty n body felt good after (not heavy, greasy, or artificial yet full).   Friendly service."}
{"text":"Breakfast options (omelette is light and fresh, breakfast burrito is filling and tasty) and salads (pear salad is so excellent, from the fresh ingredients to the balance of flavors) here are excellent, but stay away from the sandwiches and wraps (bland and overpriced for the most part, barring the tuna salad which is actually unexpectedly wonderful). The pesto pasta is actually good as well, but can be hit or miss and often way too oily.
Service is friendly, atmosphere is nothing much to report on, open and airy, crowded most weekends and at lunch. It's overly priced for what it is, but welcome to Summerlin.
Definitely not an awful place but I can't drag my husband here anymore, he's been disappointed by overpriced, bland sandwiches and burnt coffee too many times."}
{"text":"I went to Rachel's today on my way out of Las Vegas. I needed to stop at REI and then needed to get some food quickly before leaving town. The BF and I each got a sandwich, he had the chicken club and I had the 404. My sandwich was good, but not great. The ingredients were good; however, they let you choose your bread, I chose wheat thinking it would be a wheat roll of sorts....it was like sandwich bread from the grocery store and it did not hold the sandwich contents in and got soggy quickly. This was pretty disappointing. The BF liked his sandwich, but, again, did not like the bread. The sweet potato fries were kind of on the bland side. Also, the portions were huge and for a place that looks 'healthy' the portions were definitely not healthy. I thought it was just ok...I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"I hate givings horrible reviews, I really do.  I have for sure have had better food. 

Bland food.  

I got a chicken salad and it was really dry, the filling kept falling out and on top of that they didn't give us enough forks.  Seriously, they only brought my husband utensils because he had a salad.  

My son had chicken strips, we had to cut the chicken and again not enough utensils. So we shared my husbands fork and knife. 

We had to ask for more napkins because the only napkin came with the only utensils they provided.  

As far as the facility, the tables are wobbly, and while we sat here we noticed they don't clean up right away or for that matter shortly after their guests leave.   

The tv was on and after awhile sit was only a blue screen."}
{"text":"12/27
Went back to get a salad, service was slow and they still messed up the order by making it to go instead or dine in. The Cobb salad we got had TONS of meat and avocado, huge plus there. If I rated this place on the Cobb salad it would be a solid 4/5, but again, 2/2 orders messed up may inhibit me to come on a day I'm in a hurry vs wanting to sit and relax. 
------------
TERRIBLE: 
My husband ordered my food and showed up at the 15-20 minute window. Nothing was ready. His order was never sent to the kitchen, therefore they rushed my order of cheeseburger. The burger was supposed to have no bun and only cheese, nope came with the bun. So they said just scrape it off, well that also takes all the cheese off. Took one bite of my plain burger and it tasted like bad meat.  I called and the manager said it tasted bad because they rushed my food and next time my husband should just allow them to cook it the right way....I'm sorry, 50 minutes should be sufficient to cooking a cheeseburger and he told me they kept giving him the runaround instead of just owning that they hadn't even started the order. Poor taste, poor quality poor communication. The manager said she comped the bill and offered him two free entrees, I think I'll pass on a free bad meat burger."}
{"text":"Update: 6/20/17

My husband decided to pick us up breakfast. My egg white veggie omelette came with bacon! Not just one piece, but many. Not happy. When I called the manager acted as though I couldn't be right bc she \"checked it before it left\" and remembered that the first time the cooks made it with whole eggs and not egg whites. Ummm, why would I waste my morning calling about bacon in my omelette? So then I got annoyed and told her to give me her cell and I would gladly send her pics. What's really annoying is that when I said there was bacon, after initially not believing me then she had the nerve to say \"well is it just one piece?\" Ummm no, there's many pieces which you would not be able to see with all the avocado that was on top of the omelette. Really annoyed with her reaction. I'm not a \"customer is always right\" but this place has a defensive attitude about their own shortcomings. 
She did comp us one omelette, which I know my husband will use but I will go without this place. 

--------------------
Won't be back. 
I am a huge RK fan! I've been going for years to various locations in Vegas. With that being said, my favorite spot is the one near town center and Summerlin parkway. 
I came to this location the other day around lunchtime to grab food on my way home from yoga. The place seemed full outside but was only about half full inside. The manager took my order and when I handed him cash with exact change for my order he gave me coins back and I was puzzled why I didn't get $10 back. He asked me what was wrong and I told him I gave him $40.12 so my change should be $10. He looked so confused. It took a few people to help him and I finally got my correct change, but not without him appearing to be annoyed. 
I waited next to a gentleman who was also waiting for his to go order and they brought his out to him...several minutes later they waved me down to go pick mine up...odd. Usually they walk the food over to you and when I questioned why they would do one thing for one client and another for me the gentleman working didn't seem to understand English very well and just kept saying \"I don't understand\". He later apologized and said they were \"really busy\". So the crowd went from okay to too busy to walk the food out to clients in 3 minutes????
THEN, I open my food containers and I'm missing both sides. The manager told me I was supposed to grab the chips...and how would I have known that? I thought their kettle chips would be homemade. So then he had to send my sandwich back for them to add my fries which they didn't give many and they were all limp and cold. 
The manager then proceeded to tell me \"that's why it's always a good thing to check your food before you leave\" Yeah I guess when you're disorganized it is good. I know the RK that I usually go to will open your food up in front of you to confirm your order, as do most places. I rolled my eyes and the manager asked me what was wrong and I said I didn't appreciate having to get up several times for my food, once for my juice and once for my food, while others were served their food. I also thought the entire visit seemed very unorganized and the manager just seemed to have a chip on his shoulders. Not once did he smile at his staff or clients. 
I love my RK but I will leave this one alone and stick to my usual spot, even if that means driving out of the way. At least the people smile at the one I frequent."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen in the District is a quiet little cafe down the main drag. I particularly enjoy breakfast at about 8 am on the weekend. The other shops are not open, the outdoor seating is shaded, and it provides a nice, quiet place to sit and catch up with friends or loved ones.

Rachel's offers many different options for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and I appreciate that their food is prepared fresh and not out of boxes. Many of the entrees come with the option for fresh fruit as a side. I like the proton scramble (includes chicken breast and spinach) and also the two egg plate with bacon and toast for breakfast.

The staff is friendly and helpful. If you have questions regarding an item they are more than willing to assist you. This place is a small hidden gem, and a favorite for some quiet breakfast."}
{"text":"Went here on 02/21/14 with my sister, her boss, and our security escort as we were merchandizing some stores all over the airport. Unfortunately, Sammy's didn't have a table for four open, so we put our name on the waiting list, but checked out Rachel's Kitchen instead. 

There is a severely limited menu at the airport. It's mostly drinks here. 3 of us got the 440 chicken sandwich with rosted red peppers, ciabatta bread, goat cheese, romaine and tomatoes. We all asked for it tosted and they were all very cold in the center. 

The girls behind the counter had zero training in customer service. Horrible attitudes and flippant behavior. My sister's boss, Erica,  is a pescatarian and asked if they could make her a tuna sandwich. They told her that they were out of tuna. Erica said, \"I am purchasing this tuna salad that is already in my hand that I pulled out of your cold case. Can you put this on bread and make it a sandwich.\" This apparently was a confusing request to them.

When asked if we should go sit down, they snipped that it was going to take more than five minutes (okay...) so that we should go. 

Anyway... good food, horrific prices ($10/sandwich alone) and the chick with the wrist tat and monroe piercing needs to be a bit less short with customers."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying when you check in through Yelp you get a FREE GLASS OF WINE! So, of course, I got my free glass of wine and ordered the turkey club on wheat bread which was delicious as always. They have a variety of sandwiches, soups, salads, and smoothies here. They also serve breakfast all day! The outside seating is wonderful for evenings and those rare days when it isn't 1000 degrees. Oh, and not to mention when I went here Conor McGregor was here!! You know,  that Irish dude that fights, who is probably the most famous UFC fighter right now. Needless to say, my experience here was FANTASTIC."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! They have great healthy food.their service is wonderful and gracious.thank you guys for making my experience great every time! Awesome place to study too :-)"}
{"text":"Our office was having a lunch meeting and planned on ordering from the Rachel's Kitchen on warm springs since it was closest in proximity to our office. We called the day before to inquire about delivery options and were told any orders over $60 would qualify for delivery. We then asked how much advance notice they needed to place a delivery order and were told \"eh, whenever\". Based on this information, orders were collected from our team members through out the remainder of the day. Before closing out the day, I attempted to place the order on the website, however only pick up orders could be placed directly through the website. If you are requesting a delivery order, it directs you to Grub Hubs website, for which I attempted our order with no avail. Any time you selected a pasta option, the website made you chose gluten free before continuing. Not wanting gluten free, I aborted the order and figured I would call in the morning. First thing this morning I called Rachel's Kitchen back to place my order. I let the snotty girl on the other end know that I was calling to place an order for delivery. Immediately she shot me down stating \"they don't do delivery!\". She must have heard me catch my breath and then corrected herself \"well, only for orders over $60\". I let her know that I was ordering for 9 people and I was sure it would be over that amount. Snotty girl then replied \"well, for what time?\" I let her know it would be for a noon delivery. She again, shot me down stating they did not have that time available and only had a 10am slot open. Yeah. Not going to work for a lunch order! I referenced the conversation yesterday and her reply was that I could speak to the manager, so I did. Victoria was just as snotty as her employee, (lead by example I guess) asking if I was sure I spoke with this location. Then asked if she had already talked to me yesterday! Um no! I wouldn't have subjected myself to such rude customer service two days in a row. She offered no help with her \"oh well\" attitude. I let her know that we would re consider our lunch options and ended the call. This is the first time hat we have encountered such an issue with placing a lunch order and will be the last from the location since I threw the menu away."}
{"text":"We have lunch at Rachel's multiple times a week at work and I've never had a bad experience. Food is always well prepared and tasty as it gets for a quick lunch! I'd recommend Rachel's to anyone and everyone"}
{"text":"Great food. Great options for everyone. Vanessa is amazing at helping you out. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food, quiet little place to come eat for breakfast or lunch. Acai smoothie they have is delicious!"}
{"text":"Umm, apparently I've been living inn a bubble for the past year or so as I had noooo clue a Rachel's Kitchen opened up in the District @ Green Valley Ranch. 

I love this place with all their deliciously healthy food and they sell beer and wine! I can't wait to go back with my girls and have mimosa's and sit outside before it gets too damn hot. 

I had the egg white omelet w/ a side of turkey bacon. Yum Yum Yum. They boys got sunrise smoothies, and breakfast wraps which they devoured in no time. Probably cause they were hung over.  

Just watch out for for the long lines that can form, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"first time today and what a surprise! ! they have live music. I ask one of the girls and she said is every Sunday.... 
Me and my wife we both had some soup perfect on these weather, next time I'll try one of the pastas.."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious gluten free pasta!!! THANK YOU!! Huge portions. Very filling. Wonderful staff - and relaxing environment. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Rachel's kitchen is one of the rare downtown restaurants serving fresh ingredients,  passed the Fremont Street fast food row of restraurants. Its a great spot for a quick business lunch. Healthy salads that are tasty and beaufiully presented.  Welcome change to much needed small group of restaurants in downtown that are not in the casinos. Great place to have lunches and breakfasts delivered for meetings. Rachel Kitchen's food has alwasy left my staff satifsfied. 
Most of all is the smily and warm greeting you get from the owner Kathy. Thank for your warm welcome and wonderful food."}
{"text":"This place is so good!! It's nice to finally be able to get real food in Vegas! They are very willing to substitute as need. The owner is so friendly she thanks her customers for coming. Wow haven't seen this done in years!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, Staff is Awesome and a nice outdoor seating area. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Our first time eating here...big disappointment.  First of all the coffee was so weak it tasted almost like hot water.  The breakfast wrap with eggs and bacon was very soggy on the outside, and had no flavor.  The potatoes were okay. My boyfriend's pancakes were very doughy inside and undercooked...he didn't even eat his.  Cost $30."}
{"text":"My wife and I LOVE this place! The staff are friendly, and efficient. The food is outstanding; quality, portions, selection and price. I've been in during some of the busiest times and watched the staff crank out order after order with smiles on their faces and a determination to get it out quickly, and get it right every time. I'm hesitant to call attention to their divine Oatmeal Raisin Cookies as they only make a limited quantity daily and, well, I want them for myself!!! They are the bomb! The Chocolate Chip Cookies are pretty spectacular too! I have never had a disappointing meal at Rachel's Kitchen Trailwood!"}
{"text":"Came here this morning and ordered the breakfast wrap to go.  Was very disappointed.  There was barely any breakfast potatoes that came with my order.  My wrap was supposed to come with eggs, bacon, cheddar, and tomatoes.  Barely any trace of tomatoes or bacon at all.  Very bland.  I had to fight to get the paper they put around the wrap off because it was sticking very bad.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is always a quick and easy lunch fix. I ordered the Tuna Wrap with mustard instead of mayo. The tuna was a bit bland and needed more salt but overall I liked the wrap. It was simple and healthy! I usually like to get one of their pastas for dinner but ya girl is about to go to Hawaii and needs to lean out. 

I ordered sweet potato fries that were slightly undercooked and lacked some crisp but I still ate every last one lol. They still tasted great. 

The ladies that work there are really nice. I have never had an issue with service there. It makes me mad that Rachel's closes so early because I always find myself craving it at dinner time."}
{"text":"Great for Breakfast and lunch, we enjoyed the pancakes, the favorite and the bacon cheese burger. BTW, you can order from the breakfast menu anytime of the day. Friendly staff and great location by Green Valley District."}
{"text":"Really pricey for average food I can make at home :( I do like the fresh pressed juices though but overall basic food at s large price .. :("}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times now because of the rave reviews from friends and yelp.  Each time I'm grossed out and I don't want to finish my good.  I've tried the sweet potato fries, turkey burger, and chopped salad.  All were bad, especially the salad, which is basically just broccoli and garbanzo beans thrown in a food processor.  Only good thing is the cheap wine during happy hour."}
{"text":"Ate here today with my family for the first time. The staff was nice and atmosphere was relaxed. The food wasn't terrible but it was not good either. Kids had chocolate chip banana pancakes which were ok. I had huevos rancheros which was edible but not good. My husband had the breakfast burrito and didn't like it at all. He only ate half of it as he didn't like it enough to eat any more of it. We won't be eating here again and wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is great. Try the Pecan bar and the BBQ Chicken Wrap!"}
{"text":"I came here for my lunch break with my girlfriend, and it wasn't busy. We ordered two pastas, and it literally took 40 minutes. The service needs to be improved, as when I asked what the status of the food was, the response \"the pastas take a while to cook. Should be bout soon.\" Mind I didn't ask her like, \"WHERE THE HELL IS MY FOOD?\" I was just asking for the status. I know I'm not obligated for an apology, but how it was said without it, just sounded justified like I was in the wrong. 

Another one of the ladies asked if we needed anything else, I asked for a to go box since my girlfriend didn't finish her food. After waiting 10 minutes, I had to go up and ask them for a to go box. Why would you even ask us if you weren't going to get it anyway?

Service needs work, however their food is amazing. If you want to try this place out. I would definitely order to go so you don't feel obligated to tip. My girlfriend tipped 20% for two people and this is the service we got."}
{"text":"My husband and I love to brunch at Rachel's Kitchen on the weekends. Not only did they expand and have tons of seating now, but they also have an awesome outdoor seating area and live music on the weekends. It is a great little hang out place in the spring and fall when the weather is perfect. Now, on to the important stuff...

The blueberry pancakes are my personal favorite and they come with a side of fresh fruit. My current addiction is the Wilshire smoothie. Their smoothies are a bit runnier and more juice-like than other places, but they are still super tasty. They also have a great regular breakfast of eggs, toast, potatoes, and bacon. The potatoes seem to be oven roasted and aren't greasy at all. That's the thing I really love about Rachel's kitchen, everything is done with your health in mind. I have only had lunch here once and my sandwich was nothing special. The onion rings were delicious, but there were only about 3 or 4 of them, which was disappointing. 

This is a great place to relax and enjoy a meal that you won't feel guilty about later, so go grab a seat on the plaza and be serenaded while eating some delicious food!"}
{"text":"So happy they finally opened! We need some cool healthy places to eat Downtown!
After working out at the gym, I pop over and get a healthy fresh juice. Juice Bar is diverse and lots to choose from. Haven t had breakfast or lunch there yet, but its super busy the few times I have gone in for a juice. Wait time for a juice? Less Than 5 min of my time. Suggested parking, dirt lot across from The Ogden, fast and easy."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to breakfast gem.
What the heck happened?
I ordered an omelet with spinach and Swiss cheese. First of all it took forever and they were NOT busy.
This is what I found when I returned home.
This does not look appetizing by ANY stretch of the imagination."}
{"text":"Rachel's has become a weekend breakfast tradition for us at the gym down the street. We all meet up there after our workout for some great food and a great place to relax and chat. Everything that I have tried has been fantastic! I have had the omelets, protein scramble, and chopped salad with tuna. The staff is very friendly and even though the prices are a little high I still love eating there every weekend! Great place!"}
{"text":"I come here twice a week for breakfast with my Mum. AlwAys have great service & good but today's service by Nia was exceptional! Try the curry chicken salad sandwich on ciabatta. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot find. There are so many yummy options that it was hard to make a decision between breakfast or lunch. I ended up ordering the veggie sandwich on a ciabatta roll with sweet potato fries. The combination of fresh grilled veggies (eggplant, zucchini, roasted red peppers, squash, red onion and tomatoes) and goat cheese were mouthwatering. The sweet potato fries were good, not too soggy and not too crispy. I used my yelp check in offer and chose the lemon, poppyseed muffin. Wow was it good. I had to stop myself from eating more than half because it was so delicious. The lemon was a great add to the mix. 
I'm hoping to try this place again soon. This time for a salad or breakfast!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I usually go here for lunch but recently I tried their breakfast. I had their breakfast burrito, french toast and fresh fruit. It was a great way to start my day, to say the least. The fruit was crisp and the burrito had so much flavor! To top it off they had Cholula sauce. MmmmMm... The french toast were freshly baked and tasted like cinnamon. Every thing was so delicious. I will definitely be back and try some of their other breakfast goodies."}
{"text":"A great change of pace to grab a bite when you're in the downtown area.  Nice atmosphere and very friendly employees. I had the curry chicken wrap and really enjoyed it.  Also the sweet potato fries are great too.  
I am looking forward to going again and highly recommend if  you are in the downtown area.  I have to go back to try the smoothies next."}
{"text":"I just love this Rachel's kitchen 
For the 3 years I've been coming here I've never taken the time to tell my foodie friends on Yelp how absolutely fantastic the food and service is here!

MUST TRY !"}
{"text":"Sorry guys but BIG failure today... First of all we get there to pick up from ordering online and the guy at the front barely looks up from his list of receipts and acts like we're interrupting him.. I know this is a small busy  store but going through paperwork in an area that should be reserved to expedite orders is like a waiter counting his tips in public find somewhere else to do this.. Secondly a very long black hair in my wrap found .. And.. I'm done I don't like sharing bad reviews I really don't but I'm really disappointed"}
{"text":"Went to lunch with gf. We split a sandwich and were charged a $2.00 fee for the split..for a sandwich!!!!
Sandwich was messy and we were given no silverware. Food was on a scale of 1 being terrible and 10 being awesome was a 5. Kind of pricey for the quality."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. Pear chicken salad and the signature pasta was great. The curry chicken salad was a big miss for me. Seems as though there's many pieces of pear in the chicken salad mix and minimal/ almost no chicken? Besides the missing chicken the curry spice mix with all the pear didn't seem to pair well and just ended up tasting very odd. And to top it off the salad came with a balsamic dressing on the side which made no sense. The fresh juice is a plus."}
{"text":"I ordered the regular cheeseburger and did not care for it all.  It was dry, had a strange after taste to me.  However, my hubby tried it and said it was good.  He also got the Sautéed mushroom burger and really liked it.  The onion rings were fried nicely but 5 onion rings came with the order.  It's a healthy serving of them so that was a plus."}
{"text":"Had lunch today at Rachel's and was completely disappointed with the cleanliness and unfriendly staff. There were dirty plates on several tables, trash and food all over the floor, and it took forever to get our food. How long does it take to make two sandwiches? At Rachel's it takes nearly 30 minutes. The staff did not greet us nor did anyone crack a smile or thank us for our business. The food was decent however it takes more than that to gain repeat customers. Sweeping the floors, washing off the tables, and having a friendly staff would make a world of difference for this place. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Rachel's is my favorite place to get a healthy meal. People here are fantastic. You should try it out. Thank you, Vanessa!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and fell in love! I got the energizer juice and shared a salad with my friend and was delighted by both! Staff was so friendly it made the experience that much better. Can't wait to come back again"}
{"text":"They now serve beer and wine or you can Bring-Your-Own with no corkage fee!

Cool offerings:
Rotating daily special dishes. 
Pet friendly patio. 
Delicious smoothies! 
Serves Peet's coffee & Tea. 
Tasty salad options!
Breakfast is served ALL DAY!"}
{"text":"If you like fresh and tasty food, this is the place for you!!!! Literally everything on the menu is good! 

The missing fifth star:
On average it takes 20 minutes from when you walk in the door until the food is in front of you. If you are on a budget or a time crunch, this is not the place for you"}
{"text":"Ok I dont normally write poor reviews but Rachels Kitchen at the District Village Walk was such a let down.  The general feel was old and scruffy with the atmosphere and male staff no better!

Seating is uncomfortable and floor is all old and looked dirty.

I ordered the meat protein breakfast scrambler; picture uploaded too.  Well all I can say was the toast was nice!!  Seriously the place was miserable and so was my food; it really looked like it had just been scooped out of the pan grease and all with no presentation.  

I dont know maybe im spoiled going to Corner Bakery and Panera where they really look after you but this place just didnt cut it.  
To top it all off guys that work in the kitchen were glaring over and just walking around the floor on there phones.  As for the prices; well there are on the high side....lol... will not be back!!"}
{"text":"A friend took me to this place for lunch date, and it was pretty good, they have nice patio which you can bring your dog to (which is a plus for me) and their food was good had the Chicken Ceaser Wrap, pretty good. They also have good staff and friend people working there, the food preparation took some time to get though, but it was worth the wait, we will attend again."}
{"text":"Awesome place and great service from Elizabeth, Sebastian, Joe & Liz !! 

Over all great team and food is delicious"}
{"text":"The team at Rachel's Kitchen is amazing! I've been a customer since day 1. Love the food, awesome service, and really happy that they do so many community events like wine tastings and live music sessions!"}
{"text":"Could be 5 stars but they need to fix a lot of things. I got a breakfast burrito which was a 'not bad' $5 burrito...too bad it cost $7.25. It was supposed to come with avocado in it...I only counted 3 little pieces :(

I also asked if they had salsa, to which they responded \"yes\", but when I asked for it with my burrito I was told I had a choice of Tabasco or Tapatio's...hot sauce. That's not salsa :(

Lastly, the music playing was awful! I don't understand how the workers didn't snap!"}
{"text":"Im sorry but very mean and rude servers/cashier!!! 
Made a face when i was trying to decide on what to order for my kids and there was not even a costumer next to me! I know when to hurry up but seriously very rude staff!! Even made our orders to go even though i didn't say so!!! Change your staff!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I've enjoyed my food each time. I like the food options they have. I've tried quite a bit from the menu from the salad, burger, sandwich, wraps, and even the pasta. The quality and serving size is perfect for me. This place is more of a treat for me though because the price is a little bit on the high end. I do wish they had more lunch combos or something so I can come more often."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly delightful! I would like to see more wine and drinks including beer and ciders in the selection. The sandwiches are good! And it's fun that they make smoothies!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Rachel's kitchen for years. I absolutely love their food. It's great quality, innovative and delicious. The only problem I've had with them over and over again is my order coming in wrong. I usually ask for \"no mushrooms\" on my pasta and about 50% of the time if not more the order is wrong. I have a sensitive stomach for mushrooms and they make me sick. I just spent $20 on lunch and it's very disappointing to open it when I'm back at my office to see it's incorrect, again! 
Aside from control check, I think they're great but this time it's made me upset enough to say something about it."}
{"text":"We noticed Rachels Kitchen driving through this parking lot off Durango and not sure how long it has been in this spot we decided to take a risk and go try it out and never hearing about it before our son said he had ate here and he liked it for the smoothies and salads.

We noticed there is a small outside seating area with small bistro style tables.and inside
Café style setting.
Everyone was friendly when we walked in.
There were a couple of tables with people eating at.

We did not know what they had that was good so we both decided on getting  the Turkey Club ~ Smoked turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, avocado, romaine lettuce, tomatoes and mayo .
We noticed they serve a lot of salads and wraps and healthy drinks.
So they are geared more toward being a healthier place to eat at!

We enjoyed our visit and the food was fresh and good. The only thing I thought was the prices were a bit high but you get what you pay for and that is Fresh

I think we would go back and try something else.  The salads do look good. I read some of the negative reviews and I would say I am sure every place has their bad days we didn't see anything bad other than a few tables that needed to be cleaned off.
No biggie!
Why not Try it for yourself and you decide."}
{"text":"This place is super fun!  And they take pride in the quality of food!  I loved how it's \"upper scale\" food, but order at the counter.  I had the curry chicken salad wrap with a side salad.  The side salad was super simple and delicious with the balsamic vinaigrette.  The curry chicken was super tasty and I would get it again.  My friend had a chicken sandwich with goat cheese and a beautiful roasted chili on it.  Looked great and I know she enjoyed it!  Healthy portion of chicken on it!  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food was just ok, but the service was horrible. I get in there and there is a couple in front of me. The girl behind the counter told me the girl at the register next to me can help me so I move over. Wait about ten minutes, while the girl who told me to move to the next counter is going around cleaning and then getting something to drink for herself. The whole time I'm there waiting, and she hasn't said anything to me so I finally go back to her. Then she helps me. That is beyond ridiculous, so I order, then the food took forever, there was only two people in front of us, whatever about the time, the customer service by the employees was so bad I would never come back here."}
{"text":"Food is very healthy, smells like fresh cut veggies right as you walk in.  Only drawback is that the items for what you are getting is slightly expensive ( at least the breakfast items) but all in all if you are in a hurry, good place to stop, I would find somewhere else for breakfast though."}
{"text":"Lately I've been in this smoothie mood. Since I was in the area I decided to give theirs a shot. I ordered the Peanut Butter Blast. I think it was close to $5. My 3 year old daughter wanted to try it first. Right after she takes a sip she starts spitting it out! On me! Yuck.. I asked her what's wrong and she kept saying it was yucky. It was surprising cause she's never done that with other smoothies. So, I tried it next and boy was she right! It was terrible! The worst smoothie ever (sad to say). It didn't taste like peanut butter or any if the ingredients that was suppose to be in it. I don't know how to describe the taste besides terrible. Ended up tossing it. Waste of money.. Maybe it was an off day to go? Friday.. The staff wasn't friendly either"}
{"text":"This place has great healthy foods and the staff is awesome! Ask for Adriana or Cecilia at the counter and tell them Alex Simon sent you. They'll treat you like royalty!"}
{"text":"Incredibly expensive for exceptionally mediocre food. Portions are decent size service is good; last time I went in they served me a different salad from what was ordered. The manager comped the meal, well done but I still didn't get what I want. Again food is decent but sooooo overpriced."}
{"text":"Heartbreaking for me to write this review because I ate at Rachel's kitchen at least once a week, but what happened today was unacceptable. I ordered the Cobb salad to go and got it home and ate most of it and see a beetle inside of it, STILL MOVING. It was the most horrifying dining experience I have ever had. If it had been any other mistake I would be able to look past it being that I have had so many good experiences here, however I'm just disgusted and probably won't be eating out every again! Didn't know stuff like this actually happened! They gave my boyfriend who returned the salad a $20 gift card but I still will not be back
UPDATE: THE MANAGER OFFERED US WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A $20 GIFT CARD - WE TOOK IT TO ANOTHER LOCATION IT WAS NOT A GIFTCARD AT ALL IT WAS A \"CLUB CARD\". THE MANAGER LITERALLY SAID \"YOUR NEXT MEAL IS ON US.\" and said there was $20 on the card. What a liar!!!!!"}
{"text":"First thing in the morning, I love coming down to the District (8:30am)

Today we decided to try Rachel's Kitchen - after hearing a few good things from friends. 

So after browsing the menu I decided to try the Acai bowl and Sweet green freshly Squeezed juice. 
The juice was light and very refreshing - just how I like it. 

The Acai Bowl was a little too runny for my liking. I should have checked as it did say \"Purée\".

I guess I'm just used to my Acai Bowls with more of a cold and frozen like consistency.. this one was not. 

The bananas were not visible... I guess mushed in with the Acai.

The granola was nice and sweet, but smothered in the Acai.  

So that's why the lower than normal review. 

Service was great.
There's plenty of seating inside and outside
And it's clean.

I think next time I'll try something else though."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. No coffee was brewed.  No milk on the counter.   It was only 10am. There was like 3 other customers in the place.  I finished my breakfast,  never even received my coffee.  The girl that we helping us,  heavy set blond girl had nothing but attitude the entire time we were there. I always give people the benefit of the doubt and I thanked her when we ordered and paid but she kept that energy through out.  I ended up finishing my breakfast and still not receiving my espresso.  I asked for a refunded which I did receive, passed on the coffee. The experience overall was negative. The breakfast burrito was good otherwise. Forgot to mention I am a local,  not a tourist so this really irked me even more."}
{"text":"Great! Not many places to get a fresh cold pressed juice in Vegas but this place has you covered."}
{"text":"Good eggs and bacon. Coffee too. Friends' red beet juice drink was great but acai bowl was loaded with sugar.

Totally tripped me out that every single car on the fancy shiny polished concrete driveway in the lane out front of the cafe sounded like it was peeling out at 2 miles per hour. Go there, and you'll hear what I mean."}
{"text":"Fremont Street is a strange kind of food desert. Everything is frozen, or fried, or full of hidden sugars, or all three. 

After staying in the area for a few days on a work trip, I felt desperate for the kind of food I make at home... dark greens with minimal dressing, nuts and fruit. My hubs wanted a breakfast burrito.

I opened up Yelp, and there it was. Some other Rachel before me had opened a kitchen here. And there were salads, and they were good!

The food was inexpensive relative to the quality (less than $25 for the two of us) and there was a young woman singing and playing guitar while we ate. I don't always like live music, but her voice was really good, and it was really nice. 

If you're in the area and craving some whole food, this place is worth a stop."}
{"text":"I called asking for nutritional information about some of the food on the menu. They said they didn't have any nutritional information. Based on the fact that this place is catering to a certain demographic it seems like that would be readily available to the customer. Without it I really don't trust the food. I would like to know what is in my food and how much of it I am eating. This could be another Red Velvet Cafe situation (they were misrepresenting the calories of their food). Not worth it to go without knowing what I'm getting. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"This is probably my go to breakfast joint in DTLV. I love their fresh ingredients and how if I get a omelette with bacon and avocados, they deliver on hefty portions of each. The staff is really friendly, always willing to throw in homemade salsa if you ask. They are also helpful when picking out a juice or smoothie made to order. The restaurant is always clean, colorful and inviting. Pro tip: If you check in you on Yelp, you get 50% off of beer and wine."}
{"text":"Nice casual place.  Very friendly staff.  Many choices for breakfast and lunch. I had the omelet with spinach, bacon and mushroom. It was delicious. They also have the turkey bacon option.  My husband had the chicken Caesar wrap.  It was fresh with a generous portion of grilled chicken breast, crispy lettuce and tomatoes. Make sure to try one of their homemade muffins.  We had the orange cranberry and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend last night for dinner and had their signature pasta. It tasted fresh and had both lean protein and delicious veggies. I also had a chai latte which was yummy! The prices are okay...wish they were a little cheaper, but outside of that this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"A great and convenient place right next to work! Everything I've ordered has been great. Nice attentive staff. Beautiful children's artwork inside."}
{"text":"I love Rachel's Kitchen! The staff is always very friendly and the place is well kept. The prices are reasonable. I was lucky to get a free muffin today with my order."}
{"text":"I especially love the curry chicken wrap. My husband enjoyed his mushroom burger. Service is friendly, and quick. Place is clean. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Busy place though, so allow for time. Well worth it! Their fresh juice is amazing."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a smoothie after a grueling morning. The place is like the Tardis. Dr Who fans will immediately understand what I mean but for Less nerdy Yelpers, I would describe Rachel's as being a lot bigger on the inside than it appears from outside.

It is very clean, the staff are smiley and efficient and my Acai Berry smoothie with soy protein was tip top.

I'm going back for real food, maybe one of the delicious sounding breakfasts on the menu and I will update my mini review."}
{"text":"A very quick visit after a very long hike in weather too hot. I should know better, but a recommendation of a smoothie at Rachel's was welcome.

Very nice little place on Hualapai with a ton of parking. Indoor and outdoor seating is available and even at 3-00 on a Saturday it's busy. Lots of wealthy suburbanites with fancy watches, cool shoes and expensive haircuts are the main clientele. Beautiful salads and delicious looking sandwiches are to my left and right. It's not cheap but they have very good natural ingredients and the portions are ample.


Oh, my berry smoothie was excellent. I'm saving up and I'll go back for a sandwich."}
{"text":"The food here is super good, very healthy and very fresh.....highly recommend

I had the French toast. It was really interesting because it was made out of some sort of baguette, at first I thought it was going to be crunchy.  But it was so moist! it was really delicious!"}
{"text":"whenever i feel i need to eat healty, i go for this restaurant. almost everytime i come to Las Vegas, first thing i do is picking up a cold pressed juice called sweet greens at the airport."}
{"text":"I've been to Rachel's a few times. The food is decent, but the prices seem to be high for the portions. I ordered onion rings on the side of a sandwich & I only got 3. What I like about this place is the location and atmosphere. When it's warm out, its an ideal place to grab a salad or sandwich & enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"I mostly come here to grab a smoothie to go, but I have sat in for breakfast a couple times and it's always consistently good. I've tried several smoothies and they're all delicious, and for breakfast they have a crazy amount of options to satisfy anyone's tastes. Another thing I really love about Rachel's kitchen is the service - every time I've been in the employees are genuinely friendly (not fake friendly like you get in most places in Vegas) and have made small talk with me without being overly talkative. Great place to head to if you're looking for a healthier option, for any time of day!"}
{"text":"I am a local around the area. Wanted to come in for a smoothie. Showed up 5 minutes before 3pm and the doors were already locked. There was one persons still ordering and I was just stared at when trying to open the door. I understand wanting to leave but if your hours are till 3pm I expect to be able to come in at 3pm. Dumb. Say goodbye to my daily service you could have had."}
{"text":"Very good, very fresh food. The smoothies are so good as well. I like that most of the items on the menu are unique. It reminds me of a food place in NorCal that I was a regular at. 
Check it out!! Btw- I love the smoothies."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about Rachel's Kitchen.. 

My friend stated the salads are really good and she would pick one up for me.. and bring it back to work for for me ..looked at the menu on line and I had her ordered a Cobb Salad with the dressing on the side..the oil & vinegar dressing..

It was one of the worst salads I have ever had.. the Grilled Chicken was burnt & so dried out .. I couldn't even cut the chicken.. with a plastic knife..it was so hard ..I couldn't even eat it.. I tossed the salad in the trash.. $10.00 plus tax what a shame..

I could get a better one at Jack in the Box for half the price..

I know it was Christmas Eve.. but how hard is to Grill a piece of chicken.. that was like not burnt & hard as a brivery disappointed...
Will not be eating here again..

Adrian the manager.. at District is a real asset to the company. He really cares about what the guest experience means...
I did return to Rachel's Kitchen at Warm Springs Location.. it was average experience the food okay.. the smoothie was outstanding.,"}
{"text":"Great location at The District, and nice outdoor seating area! Didn't get to enjoy that during my first visit here, with the temp being around 50. I had the spinach salad with tuna & it was delicious & a huge portion! Definitely big enough for 2. I did my best to finish it, but fell short.
The tuna was seasoned which added to the great flavor of the salad. The goat cheese and mushrooms were so yummy! My dining partner had one of the pasta meals and said it was very good. 

The indoor area was not what I expected. All the furniture is patio/outdoor stuff, which just looked weird. The space is very open, with a high ceiling. It lacked warmth. Perhaps this is due to it being more of a quick serve eatery then a stick around & chat after your meal place. They do serve alcohol, beer & wine, and as of this writing there's a yelp check in deal for free glass of wine with entree. Cheers to that!"}
{"text":"reat food and smoothies! Portions were just enough.G"}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is pretty average in my book. A lot of people hyped it up to be this amazing place and it didn't turn out to be that way at all. I went a few days ago for lunch and it was kind of a struggle. First off, it was hotter than normal in there. Then, we had to wait in a pretty long line in the heat of the restaurant. Finally, when we sat down, there was hardly any seating and it was super cramped. It was a very uncomfortable experience all around. I may have gone at a bad time, but I personally didn't have a great time.

The only thing that's going for this place is the food. It seemed to be super healthy and it wasn't too bad tasting either. I got a breakfast burrito and it was actually a lot of food. I would say the food is the one good takeaway from this place."}
{"text":"This was my first and only experience at rachels kitchen. I've heard a lot of good things about this place and was excited to try it out. 
At first, I ignored paying 5.95 for a kids meal that only consisted of a very small amount of fries and 2 chicken fingers. My other options were to pay the same price for a grilled cheese or a pb&j. 
I ordered a burger and was happy because I was allowed to substitute the fries from a list of about 5 options. I choose the onion rings only to find out it came with a total of 4. 
I did enjoy ordering at the counter and having my food brought to me when the time came however. 
Bottom line, a bit pricy and you don't get that great of a quality of food. I'm sure I'll skip it next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Friendly service, healthy looking menu too. I ordered a omelette, take note it comes without cheese, don't forget to add it because it's nasty without cheese lol they were kind enough to add it afterwards and made a world of difference. The immune juice was very good, people need to understand that healthy and fresh isn't cheap therefore stop bitching about the price people. I juice at home and vegetables aren't cheap especially organic so please stop! Rant over

Overall nice experience, thank you Rachel's Kitchen I escaped from babystacks"}
{"text":"One word: delicious!

I really enjoyed coming to this cute cafe. I saw the good reviews and wanted to try it out. It's hidden and located inside of the little hotel by sunset station. Definitely need to look for it or you won't find it. They have tables inside and a little bar. You can also do to-go. 

Since it was our first time the cashier really helped us out on what to get. I decided to get the chicken Caesar wrap which was DELICIOUS! It was a huge portion and definitely the healthier route. It comes with a side and I chose a salad. We also got a smoothie, which I forgot what it's called, but it was a combination of orange juice, strawberries, and bananas and was soooo good. And to top it all of my boyfriend got the acai bowl and it was super tasty. It came with bananas, granola, and strawberries. 

Definitely a place to try out! I got a club card so that I can rack points the next time I come back."}
{"text":"My sister lives in Henderson and so when I am in town we often go to the District to eat and/or shop. I found this little gem on my last trip. I ended up going there twice during my 4 day stay since the food was so good. 

First time was on a Sunday afternoon. I had the Gorgonzola burger with sweet potato fries. Both were excellent. The burger was juicy and cooked to perfection. The cheese on top gave it a really great flavor. I am a sweet potato fries fanatic and these were not the best ever, but pretty good just the same. I also had an ice cold beer with my meal; glad to see they had some good bottled micro-brews. The combo really hit the spot and I left extremely satisfied even though I was ravenous when we arrived. My friend got the spinach salad and when I tasted it it was also very good. She also took advantage of the $3 mimosas they offer on Sundays and said they were perfectly made. 

When we went back with my sister a couple days later I decided to try a salad since that is what they are known for. I got the arugula and pear one and it was delicious! A lot of texture and crunch. It had a bite to it from the arugula but the pear balanced this with a little sweetness and the goat cheese and fennel added an extra flavor dimension. My friend got the same spinach salad (she liked it that much!) and a Bellini which she said was not nearly as good as the mimosas. My sister had a wrap and regular fries. She said they were good but nothing special. I think the best items at this place are definitely the salads. 

I agree with some reviewers' comments that the prices seem a little steep for what you get. But the quality of the food and the excellent service make it well worth what you pay. Sitting out on the patio on a nice day, this is a great place for a ladies' lunch or even a brunch/lunch date. We did notice that on weekdays this seems to be a haven for mommies/nannies with little ones in tow. But on the weekends I agree with the other reviewers that this is definitely a dog-lovers hangout."}
{"text":"Rachel's is a great spot with indoor and outdoor seating. They have sandwiches, salads, pastas, wraps and smoothies. 

When I checked in I got a comped glass of wine and I enjoyed it with my curry chicken salad, which was absolutely amazing.

Its at the District at Green Valley Ranch so there is ample parking available.

The service is great. You order at the counter and take your number to the table and they bring the food to you. The portions are a good size, not huge and not big.

My salad was $11 and felt worth it because they used spinach and mixed greens."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  Not only is the food great, healthy and ALWAYS FRESH, the service is amazing.  They have the best potato soup I have ever had!!  The atmosphere is wonderful as it is conneceted to the Keep Memory Alive Event Center at Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health which was designed by legendary architect, Frank Gehry.  the views are amazing and so is this great cafe!  Do yourself a favor and visit it.  What a cute place to have lunch in Symphony Park!"}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is almost always a solid bet. Food is pretty consistent, service is decent (most often with a smile), and location is great when it's nice outside; inside is a bit cramped. My go-tos here are the signature pasta, either turkey-based sandwich, or the breakfast wrap & burrito. They're great about substitutions (I do some weird stuff with my orders sometimes, or \"creative,\" if you wanna be nicer about it). Bottom line: not my absolute favorite breakfast/lunch place in the world, but one I'll keep coming back to. Bonus: they have a liquor license and use fresh OJ in their mimosas!"}
{"text":"Great little place for fresh food that leave you feeling great. I had an omelet with spinach and avocado, wheat toast and a green juice. It was one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. I juice everyday and the juice that they served was great. You go in and order and then they bring the food to wherever you are sitting. The food came quickly. The place was nice and clean. I will definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"This place has something for everyone. From smoothies to burgers to pasta, they have it ALL! I work right next door and didn't feel like driving to find lunch, so I decided to walk over and see what all the fuss was about (from coworkers.) The lineup to order was alittle weird at first because people were on both sides (lining up across the dessert glass and in front where you had just walked in) so after stumbling abit and making sure I wasn't cutting in front, I finally found my place and ordered. I was originally going to get the Angel Hair Bolognese but I wasn't quite sure what exactly the sauce was and even if I would like it (the cashier tried to explain it the best he could, but sweet dumb me still didn't get it), so I ordered their Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken. Now, I either missed it completely or it didn't mention it, but there IS mushroom in this dish and I didn't figure that out until I got it. I wasn't going to ask them to remake it or anything since it was my error, so I just ate around it. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC as far as taste goes. The restaurant was clean and gave it a really nice, home feeling to it. Akin to going to a family member's house to eat. I also would highly suggest grabbing one of their Lemon Bars. I tried one for the first time and absolutely fell for it, it was heavenly. Waitstaff was very nice (I wish I had names, I would praise them so highly.) If you're ever around and looking for a place for a quick bite, I would definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"After countless referrals to Denny's, we discovered this great diner off the beaten path. Fantastic breakfast wrap!  5 Stars all the way for both food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Service is good. 

Food is meh. 

My salad was doused with dressing, they forgot my avocado, then when I mentioned it, they said it would be an up charge (even though they forgot). 

Juice was mediocre. All around, mediocre. 

I don't want no mediocre."}
{"text":"The food is definitely delicious, but expect to pay a little more than you would for the same meal at another restaurant. I also ordered a sandwich from them that was not listed as having nuts. When it arrived at the table, I saw the nuts and was immediately disappointed (as I am severely allergic to tree nuts). But upon seeing my disappointment, the server apologized profusely, and had them make me something new on the spot. Very nice! Also love that they deliver :)

EDIT: Come to find out, the issue with the chicken salad sandwich I ordered was an honest mistake, and none of their sandwich contain nuts. So the menu was not incorrect in the listing of ingredients, it must have made it way into the sandwich on accident!"}
{"text":"The food and service here has been consistently awesome. It's incredibly nice to go and have a fresh and healthy meal without having to cook it yourself at home. I've had both the turkey burger and Chicken wraps here and they've been awesome. Their sweet potato fries are one of my favorites. Even their kids meals are big enough for an adult. My toddler enjoys the grilled cheese and big bowl of fruit every time. This has definitely become our families go to place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I stopped into this cute place for a quick breakfast bite. It cost 8 for a simple breakfast burrito which I thought was a little pricey. I ended up waiting 33 minutes for it. Three ingredients: egg, bacon, and potato.  They were nice staff but did not warn me the wait would be so incredibly long. I could have made it myself in half the time. I was disgruntled and let them know politely and they said sometimes things go a little slow in the kitchen. I was VERY disappointed they did not offer me even a cupcake or anything to show they genuinely cared about the frustrating delay.   Summary was a 5 minute order took 6 times longer than expected and they simply said sorry, things like this happen sometimes.  Boo!!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for healthy, quick bite to eat in downtown Vegas. Enjoyed a fresh and \"lite\" turkey sandwich and a yummy, not so lite, lemon bar. Both were fresh and good.
 Next door to El Cortez hotel, with funky bikes parked in the front."}
{"text":"It gets two stars as staff tried. I took my kids here instead of IHOP-BIG MISTAKE. The menu is pretty limited even if it looks like it is large. Prices aren't bad but you shouldn't advise a mother of a 4 year old that the French toast is only a couple of dollars more without saying IT IS ON LARGE PIECES OF FRENCH BREAD. 

I am on a zero carb and zero sugar diet, I asked about substituting potatoes (see dried out nasty potatoes pic) and toast (no butter) for avocado and was told they maybe could give a few slices. So I brainstormed and asked about bacon-the only truly good part of the meal-at least on the side.

The omelette said to be \"PROTEIN LOVERS OMELETTE\" with chicken (so I thought-I think I found a piece) had burnt bacon in it, was cold when served and the cheese was dry-see photo.

I always drove by and thought-hmmm I should try it there...NOPE-wouldn't ever go back. 

Now add insult to injury as any mother knows an iPad can be your best friend-problem is not only did their WiFi  it work but when I told them they didn't seem too bothered.

Before o forget I asked for water having seen bottles out of the corner of my left eye-but they gave me a cup-so I went to the self serve drinks-only found Vitamin water-looked and had to ask apparently it streams through the lemonade part with a button in front for \"just water\". They may have mentioned that. Also though she comped me the milk for my daughter I did actually order it.

Finally when leaving I asked for a to go box-I figured maybe the kids would eat some of the French toast later-they gave me the smallest plastic box I just said f-it-flung what I could in and left-leaving my daughter's sippy cup of milk-which they seemed to know but nobody bothered coming after me to point out (this is usually at really great service places) and when I walked in they knew exactly why I was back.

That's off my bucket list at least."}
{"text":"The best healthy place to eat in Downtown Vegas.  Love the location (so close to Fremont Street), the menu and service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Love eating at local spots like this. It's clean and we got good service. The food was healthy. the waitstaff helped us decided on what to order."}
{"text":"Great food, fast friendly service, and always clean. Great cafe style dining with healthy options!"}
{"text":"My ladies and I decided to have a nice girl's day out, so we headed to Rachel's Kitchen for brunch. 

I was a little disappointed to find out this place was a stand up and order at the counter type joint. I'm not embarrassed to admit it. I like waiter service!!! We ordered and found ourselves a TINY little booth to accommodate us. The table was abnormally slim and not very practical. 

Heat kept wafting from the kitchen area, which I found a little annoying. I ordered the grilled cheese and a watermelon juice. My friends ordered the breakfast burrito. The food was pretty good, not nearly good enough to be worth the somewhat hefty pricetag, but I digress. The food was fresh and my friends loved the potatoes, although I found them to be a tad soft and underseasoned. I loved my fresh watermelon juice and highly recommend that, so refreshing. Whenever I see that on a menu I have to order. It's my favorite. 

All in all, I've had better, but this place will do in a pinch. I'm definitely not itching to go back and if I'm in the area again I'd probably try any number of other restaurant options. Good option for healthy eating, though."}
{"text":"I've been to three locations and as far as service goes...their workers could use a shot of personality. They weren't rude, but not very welcoming either. At one location I ordered a smoothie that took a good 15 minutes. What's that about?  They get three stars because the food is always on point. I've tried their burgers, salads and smoothies. All have never disappointed me."}
{"text":"Food was good and came out quick. The service was excellent. I had an issue with my order which was fixed immediately and my check was adjusted for it. The employee even came back over to check to make sure everything was ok"}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy and most important to me - made to order. I am willing to pay more for a freshly made meal or smoothie than a machine or microwaved one!! 
Great lunch place to have a business lunch or catch up with a friend."}
{"text":"I frequently made the trek over to the Hualapai location, but now I don't have to.  OK, it wasn't that far, but the Trailwood location is now so much more convenient.  It has become a  regular stop for the kids and I after our weekly visits to the Summerlin Library.  

I have yet to try something on their menu that I do not like. You can't go wrong with the Grilled Chicken, Ultimate Grilled Cheese, or Turkey Sandwiches. The sides options of fries, sweet potato fries, mixed green salad, or onion rings round out the meal. But, my absolute fave is the Chinese Chicken Salad.  And just for kicks, I'll switch it up every once in a while with the classic Chopped Salad.  The best part however, is the fact that if I have a napping baby in the backseat, I don't have to risk waking him up by getting him out of the car and back in.  I can simply place my order over the phone and pick it up curbside, and be on my way.  And I have yet to try it, but ordering online looks super easy and convenient too. 

My kids also love the smoothies, as do I, but I have recently become a fan of the Popeye's Secret- thanks to Christie O's frequent pics and cheek ins :)  This fresh juice blend of apples, spinach, carrots, celery, beets and parsley just hits the spot and puts me in a healthier state of mind.  Thank you Rachel and Rachel's mom!

The service is always friendly and the restaurant is spotless.  I am so glad that Rachel's Kitchen offers such healthy and tasty options, helping me keep my new year resolutions!"}
{"text":"Love this place, excellent food and service...always fresh and delicious! Highly recommended!! The pasta and pear salad to die for..."}
{"text":"My favorite place for salads and lunch. It's so yummy, everything is so fresh and quick! I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Directions: 
We had trouble finding this place. So, I decided to post directions from my experience. this place is located at the D gates. As soon as you exit the tram at the D gates, if you follow the directions, you will end up taking an escalator. Please take a left and then  take the first right. After walking few feet, you will find Rachel's kitchen on the left. 

Now time to talk about the smoothie and fresh watermelon juice that we ordered. We ordered a peanut butter smoothie. I am not a big fan of peanut butter, but my friend insisted that we should try. The smoothie also has banana in it. Everything was perfect except for the raw banana they added to it. If it were ripe, the taste would have gone to another level. However, it still tasted fine and we managed to finish it. 

Watermelon juice I got here tasted just like the homemade one. I can say it is made from fresh cut fruit, no sugar, no water and no ice. Just fresh watermelon. If you are looking for healthy options, I highly recommend getting a watermelon juice. I am glad I ordered the biggest size they offer. 

Will go back again if I end up traveling via Vegas airport."}
{"text":"I like coming here when I want to pretend I'm eating healthily. Nothing in particular on the menu is necessarily any healthier than anywhere else, but the fact that they serve Acai bowls makes me feel like they MUST be better for me, right?

Service is fast and friendly, counter service. 

The food is good, even if the portions are somewhat small. I do think the ingredients and preparation taste like they are higher quality, so I don't mind the smaller portion sizes. 

They do have a rewards program (my favorite!) but you have to ask the cashier for some kind of card to sign up for the app, which I was too lazy to do. They should make their rewards program easier to sign up for. 

The booths against the wall are terrible. If you sit in the booth, the table is way too far away from your mouth, and if you are spill-prone as I am, this is just an accident waiting to happen. On the other hand, the chairs paired with these booth tables are way too tall, so my thick-thighed boyfriend couldn't get his legs under the table. Switching seats didn't help, either, because the table was also close to the high booth seat."}
{"text":"Rachel's Kitchen is consistently good. I typically get the Chicken Curry Wrap.  My hubby likes the Turkey Club. All the portions are a nice size. Their salads are great as well. I've never tried their breakfast."}
{"text":"I love Rachel's! The food is always fresh. Sweet potato fries are my favorite! & the service is always great. They're also super friendly."}
{"text":"We are locals and have a handful of breakfast places we always love. Were looking to add to the places we like to go, and we have always wanted to try this chain after seeing it in the district. So as first time customers we hit up the one closer in a hotel on warm springs.

Good coffee. Free wifi.

Food is good but wow....we were the only order up and it took forever. 

Also, no one smiles. 

We probably won't be back because the staff atmosphere and wait time is kind of a debbie downer. 

Maybe we'll try the district one but this one is a dud."}
{"text":"I really like Rachel's Kitchen and recommend it to a lot of friends who are looking for good wholesome food around the Green Valley area.  I love coming here for lunch when I'm in the area.  And, they recently expanded so they're twice as big now which is great!

The food is delicious and really fresh.  You really get the feeling they pride themselves on their menu and quality of ingredients.  I usually get the spinach salad with chicken.  It's excellent and really filling but light.  Their smoothies, especially the peanut butter blast, are just sweet enough and light enough you don't feel too guilty ordering them.

I did have an unfortunate experience there last time.  I ordered the sweet greens juice (fresh kale, spinach, cucumber, celery, apple, lemon & ginger root they juice themselves) and the grilled garden burger.  The juice tasted like I was straight up sucking dirt up through a straw and the garden burger wasn't very flavorful at all.  I think I just ordered the wrong things, but that meal made me sad.

Even with that previous experience, I'll still go back to Rachel's Kitchen.  Next time, I'll just be more aware of what I order!  The friendly customer service, quality of ingredients, and deliciousness of most their menu items definitely outshine one bad experience there.  And I'll still continue recommending this place to others, just not the sweet greens juice or veggie burger!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot at The District for a quick bite to eat. I've had many items on the menu (as you can see in my uploads), but my favorite is hands down their sweet potato fries. I know, random. 

I seriously haven't had anything bad here, so I doubt you can go wrong regardless of what you order. And the service behind the counter is always friendly. 

The only downside is it can get pretty congested. I'd suggest sneaking a corner table if you have someone that can snag one for you while you order, or grab a table outside on the patio."}
{"text":"We needed to not eat more gross food on the strip so we went looking for breakfast. Our GPS lead us here and what luck! I ordered \"The Favorite\" it was so good! My hubs had eggs and bacon and that bacon was amazing. We also ordered the Sunrise and The Hercules smoothies. So good! This was probably the healthiest and most satisfying meal we had in Vegas. I really wish they had a Michigan branch!"}
{"text":"Had the acai bowl here one time and it was okay. It was a bit too sticky/watery for me. I like how this place is super convenient and down the way from school. Have been here a few times since it's one of the more healthier places near school. 

Over day there was a sign on the wall about mimosas so  a friend and I asked the cashier about it and she said she didn't know they even had that as an option. I pointed to the sign and she was confused so we didn't end up getting that. I thought it was strange how the sign was there but the cashier didn't know about them serving it."}
