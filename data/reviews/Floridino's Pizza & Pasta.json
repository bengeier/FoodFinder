{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at this place, and I've been coming here for over 10 years now. As you've already read, the pizza muffins are AWESOME and the calzones are huge. Great atmosphere and great prices. Also have a small bar if you're trying to catch the game."}
{"text":"Our family has been going here for years!  Kids love the calzones.  They taste great and they are HUGE!  I love the Pizza Muffins.  Great family atmosphere and the service has always been very good.  Great food at affordable prices!"}
{"text":"Floridino's is one of my go-to places in Chandler. I've always received quick and friendly service, and their prices are great. I took one star off of my review because their sandwiches aren't very good, but that won't stop me from coming back and ordering other items off of the menu. Their breadsticks are a must-have!"}
{"text":"I was starving and I'd never been there before, so I thought I'd try it out. I ordered the Greek salad with chicken and my mom ordered the Steak sandwich. We waited about 15 minutes for the food and when it came, it looked.... Unappetizing. But wait... The taste was....even worse. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, I don't know. I've never had such awful food before. The chicken in my salad was obviously microwaved breaded leftover chicken. My mom said her sandwich was like a overly salted frozen steak-um sand which. It was worse than bad fast food. I told the waitress, who was the only redeeming quality in this place, and she said she could take it off our check or bring something else. She was really nice, but by then my appetite was lost and I was scared to try anything else. She told the owner, who came to the table, and I explained that the food was awful. He said there must be something wrong with me, because he's been in business for 9 years. Yes, there must be something wrong with me because I like quality food. I really don't know they stay in business when the owner is so rude and their food sucks....  The only good thing about this place was the wait help (I forgot her name, the young lady with dark hair) and their kid's menu chicken Parmesan was decent.  SIDENOTE:  After leaving this review mistakenly under the Floridino's in Chandler, the owner of the Floridino's in Chandler left me a message informing me that they ARE NOT the same. The Floridino's in Gilbert has a different owner/management and they refuse to change their name.  Sorry about that Floridino's in Chandler. I wouldn't want to be affiliated with them either..."}
{"text":"i love that they have the buffalo sauce option for pizza. My favorite it the veggie pizza with buffalo sauce, although my husband is addicted to the pizza muffins. We just recently tried the white pizza muffins and WOW. They are filled with cheeses and garlic sauce. Since we only order pizza there, that's how I'm rating them. The reason I mention this is because we tried their pasta options once and it was severely disappointing (as in, tasted like pasta from a can). But that's not why we order from them. GET THE PIZZA!"}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good, I wish the crust had more \"chew\" to it. Toppings were very lite. They use sausage balls, I assumed being an Italian restaurant the sausage would be homemade."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and its just ok for me.  My mom calls this joint \"the white head place\" because its chock full of seniors. But if you qualify for the senior discount and you have your coupon for buy one get one that is pretty awesome. Adjust expectations to just ok and you will not be disappointed. The service is good, its clean, the food comes relatively quickly. I'll continue to come here."}
{"text":"Had a working lunch at work where pizza muffins were served.  I wasn't really hungry but tried them out...WOW!  Freaking home run.  I'll pick these over traditional pizza from now on.  Can't wait to take my family here."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always fairly busy. I can't resist the pizza muffins, and now they have a few new types I need to try.Usually get pizza , so I can't vouch for much else. Very nice non chain place."}
{"text":"The wait line is really long so be prepared but the food is excellent and the pizza muffins are excellent. Also service is great"}
{"text":"I miss your pizza muffins and I miss your calzone's.  Great place to slip in to watch the game.  I miss you."}
{"text":"Yummy! I was pleasantly surprised by the quality in the pizza they make here! I ordered a large with fresh basil, onions, garlic and olives! What a combination! I would definitely recommend this place if you want to get away from main stream and try a little homemade!"}
{"text":"It was our first time at Floridino's. We had excellent service. Our waiter was a tall older man. He was very knowledgable, kind, and helpful. The Alfredo sauce was excellent, although it was a very small portion on a large plate. The salad was small, not cold, and cost extra. The spaghetti with meat sauce entree was good but came out looking like a child size portion. Our bill came to $41.00 ( plus a tip of $10.00) and no beverages. We went home and were still hungry because of the small sized portions served. Not really worth $51.00 !! We we not be back or recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not bad... Service was good, fast and friendly. We had the pepperoni pizza muffins, which tasted pretty good but I wish it had a little more filling. The meatball parmigiana sandwich was good too, great meatball. Normally wouldn't mention Caesar salad, as it's pretty standard wherever you have it, but I thought the croutons just tasted great, nice seasoning and a good crunch on them. Also had the bread pudding, which was good as long as you ate each mouthful with the ice cream, but we didn't finish it because there wasn't much ice cream on it. The lunch specials look like a good value, will definitely come back and give this restaurant another go."}
{"text":"I had heard quite a bit about this place so went to try. Even on Tuesday night it was packed, that gave me hope that food is really good. But when we ordered the food, I was disappointed. Appetizers - muffin pizza was delivered after the main course was served. Pasta Alfredo was ok, not at all something to die for compared to few other chain restaurants or even other mom and pop restaurants. They charge extra to add salad and bread which was odd as all other restaurants for the same price of approx $14 will include salad and bread."}
{"text":"Great service. Food was pretty good. Love the crust on the pizza. Dessert was also delicious. Table shared a cookie sundae & it was very sugary sweet but we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza- lunch size 7\" pizza and a drink was only $4.25.  Service was extremely efficient- great for lunchtime.  Very busy om a Friday afternoon.  You can add a small salad for only $1.50."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch at 11:45. Was on a wait list for about 7 minutes. We got a seat and ordered off of the lunch menu. Very well priced and food was excellent. I also ordered a half dozen of the pizza muffins. AWESOME!  Great local restaurant for Italian food. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ate the Deluxe Calzone and it was delicious, not to mention big. Prices are very reasonable. I plan to go back."}
{"text":"The Floridino's on Alma School is not connected to this restaurant in any way.  The owners of Floridino's in Chandler opened this location back in 2000, but they sold it over ten years ago, and it has sold a few times since then.  The food and menu are different, and the current owners have NEVER trained as a franchise or paid for a franchise, and unfortunately the Chandler Floridino's ends up looking like they are the same company, because the owner in Gilbert is using the name due to a technical loop hole in the paperwork, but it is not only shady business practice to do this, it also hurts the reputation of the owners of the Chandler location who have worked for over 15 years to build their business to the success it is."}
{"text":"Try the pizza muffins.  They were awesome.  Other than that, I can't say much else about the restaurant.  It is very low key and has a lot of customers from the neighborhood.  This is a good place to knock down a few beers and grab some snacks (i.e. pizza muffins) after work."}
{"text":"You can't beat this restaurant for a place to take the family - great atmosphere, great food, and great price.  The wife and I go here every couple of weeks.  Only problem we have found is it seems like more and more people are discoving how great this place is so it can get kind of busy.   HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"The name is no longer Floridino's and don't confuse this place, now called Floridema's with the better restaurant in Chandler. Prices are too high for the quality of the food and service is mediocre at best. They should change the sign on the front of the building. This is not Floridino's!"}
{"text":"It's a small place, kinda crowded, but not in a bad way. Best calzones in town! Service is usually good and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I have been to Floridino's many times and have loved every experience! It's a small family restaurant great for everyone. The location is a little far for me but definitely worth the drive. The atmosphere is wonderful and makes you feel at home. Customers always look satisfied to me and happy. Very kid friendly, but also has a bar and sports shown on T.V for adults. Prices are very reasonable, not expensive for how delicious the food is.         The service is great every time. Employees are always very welcoming and servers are quick with drinks and food. The only thing is that they can be very busy on weekends. Each time that I have been, I have been seated fairly quickly for a party of two. However, for larger parties, I could imagine waiting a bit longer. But I can say, it would definitely be worth a small wait! Servers are always very nice, patient, and helpful. Whenever I finish a drink they are always quick to get a refill. And they always make sure that you have everything you need, which is great.     Finally, food! I have only ordered their pizza muffins, because I just fell in love with them the first time, and have never wanted to get anything else! They are absolutely amazing. I have tried three of their flavors and love them all. Definitely a great food to share with other people. I am always so full after eating and always satisfied. They also have the best dessert! Their baked cookie and cannoli are so good. Both very sweet and savory. If you have never been to Floridino's I highly recommend that you try it out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here was really bland, I'm not sure why there are so many good reviews... And yes, we tried the pizza muffins! Maybe I was expecting a real Italian restaurant but it was extremely casual. For example, the salad is iceberg and the dressing comes in a to-go container with a lid, and they use the red plastic baskets for everything.  Not what I had in mind! I wouldn't recommend going here if you're looking for great pasta!"}
{"text":"Real good italian food. Their lunch specials are such a great deal and you can't go wrong with any of them. I especially love the complementary bread they give you with your meal."}
{"text":"Visiting from Houston Texas was recommended here. Really good food!!! I fell in love with the pizza definitely returning"}
{"text":"Simple, excellent food with awesome service. Not only is the food good, but they are the example of what businesses should do to give back to the community that supports them. They do multiple fundraisers throughout the year for area schools and non-profit organizations. Large events are a must do here, cant beat the prices for banquet style events. Great job Floridino's!!!!"}
{"text":"Best chicken Alfredo ever!! Love the creamy sauce and the delicious soft bread that comes with it! Their pizza is also great! Love love this place :)"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp, I decided to try this place last night. I placed a to-go order and when I got there to pick it up I was pleasantly surprised by how busy it was and how much it smelled like the little places we used to eat in Chicago.   The good-  The hostess person who rung me up was extremely friendly and checked inside all my boxes before putting them in bags, to make sure my order was correct. I can't tell you how much I appreciate that.  The delux steak sandwich was the BOMB. The steak was tender and plentiful and the veggies were just right. The pasta salad is phenomenal. It doesn't seem to be much more than pasta, dressing, and cucumbers but it is DEEEElish.  The pizza muffins~ Very good and not was I was expecting, although next time I will skip the sausage and ham combo and make my own. The dude ahead of my got bacon, onions and ground beef and I was wicked jealous.   The Meh-  We ordered a kid's spaghetti, which was pretty straightforward. The portions seemed a bit small as another poster mentioned. Although I did not actually see a regular sized order of spaghetti, the kids meal was kinda meager. Although if you go on Wednesday when kids eat free, you couldn't complain. Incidentally, someone also said it is busy on Wednesdays because of this... Thursday was packed so I can't imagine what it would be like when free food is involved.   The bad-  Meatball sub was a huge letdown. Meatballs were just little frozen generic subway-esque disappointments.  The portions. That pasta salad was to die for but I only got a couple of bites of it, which made me sad.   Overall, we're down to give this place another try. We definitely wanna try the pizza and antipasta."}
{"text":"Eh...  The person who took our to go order was nice, and it's decent priced...for that a 3  But my sauce on my raviolis was just bland maybe out a can with no seasoning, I paid extra for meatballs and got two small ones. I'm guessing my pasta was put in bowl then sauce over cuz they were all stuck together.  Not great but not bad, but I feel like I'd put more Italian effort into then them and I'm German."}
{"text":"Ok food and price but not real Italian food, if you are looking for arthritic food, don't let the name fool you"}
{"text":"We hosted a bridal shower here and everyone was a pleasure to work with.  We had the option to choose from several different tablescapes and they executed it perfectly!  The food was delicious and I didn't have to worry about anything.  Do not hesitate to hold your event here!!!"}
{"text":"Always great food and service. Kids eat free on Wednesdays too which was a nice surprise.  Been coming here for years, never disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a decade. The spicy chicken pizza & the pizookie can't be beat!"}
{"text":"The first time I had their food was when my boyfriend picked up a to-go order for us. He ordered the pizza muffins,a Cesar salad for myself and an Italian sandwich for him. LOVED every part of the food my salad was fresh and tasty. They make their own sauces come to find out, their salad dressing and marinara sauce are superb."}
{"text":"First time dining here and it was ok.  The ziti was decent and my friend said the lasagna was decent as well. Unsure if I will go back."}
{"text":"The cheese and the pepperoni on my mini pizza glisten, taunting me to dive in. I scarf down my pizza in a matter of minutes and rub my belly, thinking, 'I'll have to do a few more crunches tonight but it was well worth it.'  This is the usual battle I have when I go to Chandler's Floridino's for lunch with the gang where it's always a struggle to avoid the calzone, which is seriously the best calzone I've ever had in my life.    Floridino's is one of my favorite lunchtime destinations because the service is good and the pizza is dyn-O-mite. And you can get a  mini pizza and a drink for under $5 during lunch time. Lunch doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"Love the food and value! Portions are reasonable for the reasonable price. Food quality is very good.   This is the second time Dustin was our server. He detracts from the awesomeness of the food and restaurant. Both times, he will take the order and disappear or stands by the POS station. The other servers came by and filled drinks. This time we had to walk to the kitchen window to get a an entree corrected (served with marinara instead of meat sauce). He dropped off the bill. We had to hold up the payment folder w card to get him to take it. If I get him again, I won't come back. So sad."}
{"text":"I really like their food. I recommend the calzones and the pizza bagels. Pretty good price for one person and its very filling.  I would have given this four stars but the service is kind of iffy. Sometimes the service is really good and sometimes it's eh."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place. We picked it up for dinner one night. I had meat raviolis. Tasted just like Chef Boy r D from a can. Yuck."}
{"text":"Pizza muffins are amazing. We also like lasagna and and anti pasta salad. They also gave pazookis!"}
{"text":"The patrons here look like they are all on the same bowling league. Now before you think I'm being snotty, there's something very comforting about a blue collar, good food, family restaurant.  I've had the baked spaghetti and it's delicious. The wine selection isn't very good, but they serve cold beer.  I would recommend this place for a lazy week night dinner."}
{"text":"Where has this place been my whole life, or least in my lifetime of using UberEATS?! It has been by far the best food I've ordered. I will admit, that they got my order slight wrong, but it was a blessing in disguise because the chicken alfredo was delicious. But what was even better were the buffalo chicken muffins. Fear not, they aren't as spicy as the description may seem. The portion was enough for me to eat three meals throughout the week and it heated up just as good as day one. I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Hot yummy and friendly staff!  Always a great neighborhood eatery for a great price."}
{"text":"Restaurants like this ladies and gents are why you don't need to be married! Great job folks!!"}
{"text":"So...since I first ate fresh brick oven mushroom and onion pizza with my Daddy in a little dive on Peachtree St. in Atlanta in 1972, I have had this thing for pizza.  (Yes, I had eaten it also at the only Italian restaurant in our area - Gargano's - it was good, but not like that one!!!) I love it.  No other way to put it.  So, when we find a place we like, we don't want to change.  Well...we had our favorite NY style pizza in the town we left in Cali last year - Rocky's - and had no hopes of finding a place with the same home-town, delicious vibe.  BUT, we did!!  At FloriDino's in Gilbert.  We come back here at least once a month, and I even tried lunch  - good deal, too.  I'll just break it down quickly:  1. The prices are quite reasonable, especially considering....(keep reading...) 2. The portions are incredible.  We share...everything! 3.  Pizza Muffins were invented by a genius and man, oh, man - they are good fresh,        leftover, 5 days old...whenever. 4.  The bread sticks/cheese sticks are quite yummy. 5.  The calzones are ginormous and delicious beyond the imagination - especially       the White Calzones.  Oh heavens!! 6.  The pizzas are excellent - any way you like them. 7.  They make a decent Caesar - big enough to share. 8.  Tiramisu was huge and delicious and the cheesecake was good, too. 9.  The service is great, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere       congenial. 10.  Family style seating, bar seating, cozy booths and table seating. 11.  ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Hidden Gem!  Service is fabulous, the pizza is best I've had in a long time! Baked spagetti will put you over the edge!"}
{"text":"This a review for the location on Guadalupe and Baseline.  It doesn't seem to be on Yelp.  Anyway YUM!  The second we walked in my mouth watered it smelled so good.  We were sat down immediately and the service was great.  The salad was eh but edible.  The pizza muffins were divine!  We ordered six and they brought 8 which is always fun.  We devoured them with the yummy Bruschetta type sauce that came with it.  In addition we got cheese ravioli with meat sauce and chicken fettuccini alfredo and breadsticks.  The breadsticks were good though a little dry for my taste.  But in general  YUM YUM YUM!!!  The best Italian I have had in the Gilbert/Mesa/Chandler/Tempe/Awatukee area by far!"}
{"text":"Been here about five or six times.  OK food. OK service. No Italian beers on tap and not that many in the bottle.    OK atmosphere.  Just wish they would replace the worn out padding in the booths. Wouldn't hurt to adjust the booth lighting so you didn't feel like you were the guest of honor at a KGB interrogation.    My wife loves that giant cookie and ice cream dessert thing.  It's an old stand by kind of place that you can count on for a good meal with decent service.  They do a good business here and are busy everytime I drive by."}
{"text":"I had never been to floridinos before booking my grad party with them.  I went off yelp reviews, price,  and location.  It was amazing!  The food pleased even the pickiest of Italians (not exactly traditional, but delicious nonetheless)and was priced great.  Lindsay,  the banquet coordinator was helpful and gave great guidance (the baked spaghetti is not to be missed). Even though almost everyone came,  we were still left with a ton of left over food,  which the server helped us pack up.  I can't wait to come back and sample some other things!  My favorites were the baked spaghetti and pizza muffins! Thank you again for great food and service!"}
{"text":"Just visited again last night. I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! Greatest calzones ever. Yum, yum, yum."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some pizza, so I yelped it and found this place about a half mile from my house. I just moved in and have been looking for a place in the neighborhood that I could frequent and not have to spend too much.Pretty sure this is the place for me.  The pizza muffins are awesome.  I also got the steak sandwich, which was delicious. My wife had the veggie lasagne, which she liked. I thought it was just ok, but I can't say I'm at huge fan of veggie lasagne in the first place. The salad was pretty basic, but I don't go to restaurants for salad. All in all we were both happy with what we ordered.   The service was great, especially considering how busy it was. We went on Monday night, which is senior night. If you're over 55, it's buy one get one. I think every old timer in the entire city of chandler showed up. But we only had to wait about 5 minutes to get a table, and got our food about 15 minutes after we sat down.  If you're in the mood for simple but tasty food without a bunch of fluff, hit this place up."}
{"text":"The margherita pizza was delish!! My friend had the pizza muffins with jalapenos, YUM!  Nice family place but we went with friends and stayed for two hours, didn't feel rushed at all.  I will definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"Every meal that I have had from this restaurant has been fantastic. However, it is no exaggeration to say that I'm absolutely addicted to the pepperoni pizza muffins! I would eat them over pizza any day from any restaurant. Although it does make me sad, it probably is a good thing for my waistline that I now live on the west side of town!"}
{"text":"As everyone else said the calzones are great!  Gets busy during lunch, but they seem to be used to it.  $7 for a calzone and a drink is a great price too."}
{"text":"This is, as far as I'm aware, THE casual Italian place in Chandler. There's been more than one occasion where myself and a group of friends can't decide what to eat, and have gone here by default. We all get calzones (which are a bit greasy, my only complaint), which are always huge and hot. There are plenty of choice for the stuffing, so everyone gets something they like. They've just expanded to add a new dining area, which was good since before we'd occasionally have to wait (gasp!) for a few minutes to seated. So no, don't go here if you want fine wine and fancy Italian dining. But do go here otherwise."}
{"text":"Stopped into Floridino's for lunch with 3 other friends today. I've been here a few times in the past, and today I wanted to try something other than the pasta. We were put on the list for a 20 minute wait, which I thought was reasonable, as the place seemed pretty packed for lunch. No biggie.  Got our seats easily within the quoted time, and sat down and ordered a round. We got our beers very quickly, and also were brought waters without asking, which was nice. Our waiter did not seem like he brought his \"A\" game, or even his \"B\" game today, as placing our order seemed forced and uncomfortable. We waited about 15 minutes for our food, which I think was pretty normal, as there were three calzones, and one sandwich. The food was fantastic, and when we asked for more marinara, the waiter brought us some right away.  When the check came, the waiter simply dropped off what looked like the check and immediately left. About 5 minutes later he came back and we asked for him to split the check. He took the check over to the bartender, and had the bartender split it, which I thought was rather strange, and looked very upset about having to split the check. Another 5 minutes, and we got the separate checks back. I got up to get my own box while waiting for the checks because who knows how much longer it would have been.  Food - Fantastic. The calzone was amazing. And more than I could finish. Price - Very reasonable. With tip it was $12 for a calzone and a beer. Service - Bad. It seemed as though either the waiter hadn't waited tables before, or just really hated us for showing up.   I'm giving two stars based on service. I could easily see giving 4 stars with a good waiter."}
{"text":"The garlic knots are a must. The calzones are the best I've had. There is just something about the cheese that makes you not want to stop. And the baked lasagna is superb. The price is right and I have enough leftovers to last me another 2 servings. The service is okay, but everything else makes up for it."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and the pizza is superb! Crispy, flavorful, and savory. Pure heaven. I've also always had really attentive and courteous customer service. It's nice that they have the banquet hall for larger groups...each time I've been, it's with about 20+ other people. The restaurant is super accommodating!"}
{"text":"First and foremost the food was good and the wait staff friendly. This was my first time here so I went with a couple of menu items that received raves on Yelp, the pizza muffins and pizza.   I was a little disappointed in the pizza muffins, maybe because of all the hype I was expecting something that could not be achieved by a pizza muffin. It was good, but not a must have good. You might want to order these for small children as their dinner, or order them before you leave so you could pack them in the kids lunch for school.   The pizza, a large special, was one of the better pizzas that I have had. It actual had dimension; one might say layers of flavor. This will be one of the pizzas that I will start ordering instead of delivery because the place is so close.  The restaurant was casual and very open and was just a little too loud for my liking. It was very busy when I went at 7pm on a Sunday. Take a suggestion from me, and use the takeout."}
{"text":"We read the great reviews on Floridino's and so we decided to give it a try. Well, wasted money and calories!  Worst pizza ever!  No flavor at all.  A frozen pizza would have been better!  I'm only giving it a star because it forces me to!"}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best value for Italian food in the East Valley. went to dinner with the family last night and enjoyed their homemade pizza muffins in a variety both flavors including barbecue chicken and pepperoni and sausage. the wait staff is extremely friendly and spend time making sure that your experience is a good one! everything on the menu is delicious and I will be returning often! I highly recommend floridino's to anyone looking for that Mom and Pop experience at a great price."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years. I would eat there after getting out of Erie school. My parents took me there now I take my kids. Always good hot tasty food . great salad and calzones. Will visit again and again. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout of lasagne and chicken parm.  The lasagne was ok, the chicken parm tasted previously frozen and the side pasta like Chef Boy R D.  Would try the pizza or calzone next time but not a fan of the dinners."}
{"text":"I thought I had a find, but look at all the prior reviews!   I just don't understand why they aren't all fives.   Maybe because this is a family style place and not a yelpie-yuppie date night joint.  I live too far away to visit regularly and have only been the once.  The wife, kids and grandkids all loved our varied orders and the pizza is outstanding with a just-right hint of yeast.  If gas prices ever come down again I will be making special trips to this place."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time and was amazing. Tonight was not super great.  Got chicken parmigiana and it was a chew frozen chicken patty. Also got the chicken primavera and it was good but not amazing. Also realized after we paid that we got charged almost $5 extra for one of our meals.  On a plus their bread sticks are amazing but not described very well. I bet the pizzas and calzones would be amazing if they are made with the same bread.  Our server was super nice and very good. Just wish the food was better.  Would recommend sitting outside as their AC is not working very well."}
{"text":"I had a HUGE Meat Calzone with a Coke. Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  I've been going here at least once a month since 1998.  Often it has been a weekly lunch spot.  During that time I almost always ordered the 2 item calzone which is big and a great deal with drink.  Occasionally I order some pizza rolls if I am not as hungry.   They are also excellent. They often have big crowds especially on Thursday or Friday at 12 so get there a little earlier to beat the rush.  They usually have a large crew working and the servers are quick and efficient so even if there is a little bit of a wait, it's worth it and it won't be long.  I guess it's been a while now since they expanded their square footage which helps with those busy days.  I can't understand how anyone can criticize the decor??  WTF?  Maybe those people actually enjoy all the crap on the wall at a TGIF's.  I go there for the food."}
{"text":"Floridino's is a great place to go for authentic Italian food. I love love the pizza muffin. It's so tasty and super reasonable with the price. I am also a big fan of their Antipasto salad. So glad to have a local, authentic restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"They were incredibly accommodating and the food/service was awesome. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious pizza around downtown chandler. The pizza muffins were my favorite.  The staff was super friendly!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot. Great food, good prices, and no bullshit service. Pizza muffins are my favorite. Keep it up guys. Go in early,n place gets packed"}
{"text":"Pizza muffins are what brings us here.  They are awesome.  Good salads and great service as well.  Atmosphere is cozy and relaxed.  Good for families."}
{"text":"This place is like a time warp. You know in E.T. when they go out, how dated and weirdly old timey everything looks? That's how this place looks. Certainly not a place to go when you have to impress someone, as it is clearly meant to be a comfy family-style restaurant.   But I am a family style kind of gal so this place was right up my alley. The food is tasty, plentiful and affordable. We had the greek salad, large pizza with green peppers, and manicotti with meat sauce. The greek salad was your standard greek salad, kind of overpriced for how much you got and I would likely pass on salad next time. The pizza was huge and delicious though, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that instead of little strips of green bell pepper, they finely diced the peppers so you get pepper in every bite. A slightly floppy, awesome NY style pizza. The manicotti was very rich and heavy and far too much for one person to eat on their own - I should have known better, considering it was stuffed to the gills with an awesome cheese mixture. The meat sauce was flavorful and had a bright tomato and fennel taste.   Service is fast and efficient (though leaning on the perfunctory side). The restaurant is clean with a dive-y kind of atmosphere, but I wouldn't have it any other way. You really get the feeling that you are in a well-loved neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Yummy Italian. Inexpensive.  Not too much seating though. Pizza rolls & calzones are awesome!! Would be a great place for lunch too!!"}
{"text":"The pizza muffins and pizzookie were real good. Service was on par for a busy night. I'd come back again if I'm in the area. There should be one in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Good spot to eat and was not too loud. Service was good as well. My cousin got a fettuccine alfredo and I got their pizza muffins. The prices were affordable as well."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to get here is their spicy chicken pizza muffins! Wow!!! I have been addicted for the past 8 years and has never been disappointed! We have taken all of our friends and now they are addicted! Great customer service!!   Their side of bread or side salad is not the greatest or their water but their pizza muffins will change your life with marinara and their home made ranch on the side!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've experienced in a long time. I sat for 40 minutes without a server coming over to ask what I wanted to order, and then I asked for a manager. A blonde/redhead named Sarah came over and gave me the biggest attitude. She kept saying \"I don't know what you want me to do\" and did nothing to resolve the situation. I left without being helped by anyone. Completely disappointed since this was my first time coming here, and I didn't get to try anything. Don't come here if you can help it."}
{"text":"LAME, I came for an internet special and even after showing it to my server did not honor it due to the fact that no manger was available. BAD REVIEWS ARE A BITCH!"}
{"text":"nice local italian. great people. real food. great quality, reasonable prices. no negatives at all... I go a few times a week and have never been disappointed. I would recommend this resturuant to anyone...Dema, the owner, is always there to welcome you. servers are attentive, professional and knowledgeable"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I wanted pizza for dinner, and a quick Yelp search showed a highly-rated pizza place practically across the street...there wasn't even a second thought.  And we were not disappointed!    We had a margherita pizza and coke, and got out of there full and happy for less than $15.  Service was good; they weren't very busy and the server was attentive and available.  The restaurant had a good \"pizza joint\" vibe.  The banquet room off to the side looks like it would be a great area for large groups or parties.    There was a lot more on the menu I'd like to try, everything looked great.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"They have my kind of casual service.  Never overly happy- in your face- bombarding service.  Your waiter asks if you're doing OK a couple of times and if you need anything after that, you just tell them. It's a small place, so they will always be near by. I always enjoy this honest to goodness Italian food.  I've had the eggplant, the fettuccine Alfredo, calzone and the Sicilian cookie dessert . . .all amazing!"}
{"text":"First-timers: Get the two-item calzone, and arrive at the restaurant as close to opening as you can if you want to get a table with no wait.  To expand on that, the calzones here are huge and perfect. The outside of the calzone, instead of being an obstacle to get to the filling, is delicious in its own right. The filling choices are pretty extensive and include more unusual items like salami and spaghetti.  If you are a returning customer or just have a bigger appetite than most, try the pizza muffins appetizer. This can work as a meal or appetizer, depending on the group size. 12 for $5 is an amazing deal. These have meat, cheese, sauce, and bread in every bite, and they are simply fantastic.  Everything I have tried at Floridino's is great. The bartender and servers are friendly and give that extra something that makes the customers feel special."}
{"text":"Service, awesome.   Food, great.  Tried the special.   Great pizza.  Thin type crust, good sauce, and affordable for a large.  Parking is great.  Fast seating.  Just do it!"}
{"text":"My family loves to go here on Monday or Tuesday, which is family night there. Pizza muffins are awesome!  W have been eating here for the past couple of years."}
{"text":"We came to the restaurant after a Sorority meeting - with a pretty large group....15.   Castaneda was the waitress and handle our table plus one other large party of 7 and was amazing never skipped a beat.   I had a pizza which was great but other guests had calzones, lasagna, pasta and everyone enjoyed each bite of their food....I probably wouldn't have ever picked this restaurant driving by but if I am ever in the area again I would definitely come back and bring a friend!"}
{"text":"Food and service is always good.   I have never been disappointed.  We love their pizza muffins and  calzones.  Also their antipasto salad."}
{"text":"This isn't just a Yelp review, it's a love letter. We went to the Phoenix Bridal Show last month, and Floridino's was one of the vendors. There were quite a few food samples, but their samples stood out. The fettuccine Alfredo was the best I've ever tasted, hands down. And the lasagna was loaded with beefy goodness. We had been sharing samples, but I actually grabbed my own separate samples.  We drive 40 min, one way, to try the food tonight. This restaurant isn't fancy, but when your food is this good who cares?!?!!! We asked friends to join us, but weren't sure how many would be coming. I didn't make a reservation. The wait staff was very accommodating. In fact, there was several tables available to accommodate large parties at any time.   For a Sunday, the restaurant was packed! It must be a popular choice for Sunday dinner. We ordered the pizza muffins and they didn't take very long to come out.  They were a little bit smaller than I had imagined, but chock full of flavor. The lasagna was just as meaty as the sample we had at the bridal show. I had the pasta primavera-the sauce was just divine. We also shared a cannoli, and it was just perfect.   Btw, why are you still reading this? You should be at Floridino's right now. Just go already! We're planning a wedding vow renewal and will be contacting Floridino's to be the caterer. This was the first but definitely not the last time we'll be eating here."}
{"text":"Because of my Chinese background, I've had a lack of some serious food initiations... ie.  I never tasted a Pop-Tart til college, and I never had pizza rolls until here.  This is one of those restaurants the local neighborhood likes to eat at, and if you aren't a local, you'd only swing by b/c there is something you extremely like.  We are definitely the latter and this is our order for 2 people:    1.  Pizza rolls (comes w/ ham & sausage... a sliced up calzone w/ less chesse) 2.  Antipasto Salad 3.  More pizza rolls for taking home ..."}
{"text":"It was the first time I've been here and the service was outstanding, the food was AMAZING and tasty, the atmosphere was nice, but... You walk out hungry! The portions are ridiculously small and the price for it is not descent at all it's pricy for the size they give you. Someone needs to notify them to make there portions a bit bigger. The next dinner I had the next day was McDonald's and that was 3 times as more filling then this. That day I went to floridinos I went hungry so I had to stop at another restaurant to fill me and my family up. We won't be coming back there."}
{"text":"I went here on 4th of July on their $4 pizza muffins deal.  We were seated within 15 min on 4th of July, granted it was 2 PM. I was pleased with the wait time. we ordered the pepperoni and combo pizza muffins for $4 per dozen along with a large antipasto salad to share.  The salad was very wet and drenched in sauce, but it was very tasty and tangy, and the pizza muffins were soft and doughy. I enjoyed all the items and the price of the items bumped them from 3 to 4 stars. I would come back again for good and inexpensive Italian food."}
{"text":"Simply fantastic. The only problem I have ever had coming here was that I never want to get anything new. My usual is always so good and consistent that I can't stray away. I've had samples off friends plates and it's always great.   I have always had the BBQ chicken muffins. If you've never had their pizza muffins, stop whatever you are doing and head straight their now. They're amazing. The other pasta dishes are also very good.   This is a popular family restaurant, so expect to wait for a bit on a weekend evening."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out some original pizza muffins, fettuccine alfredo, and baked manicotti. All were delicious! The alfredo sauce was rich and creamy. The pizza muffins were a hit with my son who normally doesn't like pizza. We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Solid performer in the fast Italian take-out scene.  Can't go wrong with their calzones.  You can already tell if you've read my reviews that I love the combination of spinach and mushrooms so that's what I always ordered in mine!  The tomato sauce and cheese are not overwhelming and the serving is generous.  The ex always got a meat calzone and he said \"no\" when I suggested Floridino's for dinner.  We may have tried the pizza once, but we decided after that to stick to the calzones.  Service is pretty fast and reliable from what the take-out perspective, which is how we always ordered.  I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could.  It's good eating, but nothing in the \"WOW\" category that would grant it 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is a regular for me. If you've had GREAT Italian, this is not that. It's GOOD, it's VERY reasonably priced. The calzones are excellent and I'm not sure you can get a better lunch for a cheaper price almost anywhere. Service is great. They are always busy. Quite frankly the worst thing is that parking spots can be tough if you drive a big truck -- ahem-- but other than that it's great. I love it. I go there once a week, it's like comfort food."}
{"text":"My first time trying this place and I love it! It's inexpensive and delicious! I love the sauce because it is light and not thick and full of pepper like other places. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"It was my day off. A breezy 70 degree day and I had a taste for an Italian sandwhich.  I've heard this place has killer lunch specials and to my surprise it had killer customer service too.  For a quick lunch eat quickly became one of the best treated dining experiences.    Mellisa was my waitress. A smiling blue eyed warm person whom made me feel like I was back in my grandfathers italian kitchen chatting with an old friend.    She recommended the chicken parm and I added a cheese slice, I'm from Chicago so I am always curious about a restaurants pizza.  The chicken parm was huge. 10 inch bread stuffed with chicken sauce and cheese. I took half of it home.   The slice was good a cross between New York style and artisan pizza. A great butter crust.    I also had a lemonade which was perfect for our door seating and the patio.     Check em out for lunch. You won't be disappointed in the quality for the price."}
{"text":"Solid, cheap, delicious Italian.  Good calzones, baked spaghetti, and Alfredo (don't forget to add chicken).  Excellent for takeout as well."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Great prices and excellent service.  Loved the chicken park and butternut squash ravioli ."}
{"text":"I LOVE Florindino's. Their food is consistently good, especially the pizza muffins! Their ranch is house-made and delicious also. 3 stars instead of 5 because although I have come here many times, I had to stop a few months ago after I couldn't take the grumpy hostess they've had for about the last year.   Still worth coming, just don't let the person seating you turn you off from the rest of the experience!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the Monday night specials.  Food was good and price was cheap!  Service was great and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 11 people and as far as I know all of the food we ordered was spot on!  Of course, we tried the pepperoni muffins and they are pretty freakin good... I ate 3 or 4 .   The reason I took off one star is because the Italian wedding soup I ordered was not hot... At all. I didn't send it back because it was edible and I was hungry. I also noticed the stopped refilling drinks after the check was paid...   Worth going back for the muffins but nothing else I tried (soup, pizza, chicken parm) was worth going back for."}
{"text":"Just went there for dinner again.  What happened?  Pizza was downright lousy.  Crust was awful-sausage not tasty at all.  Completely forgettable."}
{"text":"Always so amazing at this place. The nice servers and the food made with love. Just can't beat the prices and the atmosphere.  Our server Ryan was so kind and helpful. We ordered fettuccine Aioli with chicken, a veggie bowl and baked speghetti with meatballs. Also ordered the house special muffins. Too die for!! Absolutely must go to place when u want Italian food that is deliciouso...."}
{"text":"Steady. Good food. Great prices.  I have had many calzones and they have been detrimental to my health.  If I were to choose one to end my life, I'd choose Floridinos.  Not that it's unhealthy, it's just my lifestyle. Don't judge, I like flavor and flavor is not salad."}
{"text":"Second time tonight at Floridino's. It was even better than the first. The original pizza muffins are a must order. They are so good i should have made them my meal. I had the baked spagetti with italian sausage.  The sausage was the star. It was spicy and delicious. My boyfriend had the italian deluxe sandwich served hot. He was very happy.  The service was great. This place gets packed. Be prepared to wait if you get there after 5:30."}
{"text":"This place is very overpriced for what you get. They charge extra for extra sauce...really? A huge calzone with a tiny side of marinara??? I think that's being a little cheap. Will not be returning. It's the things like that are very annoying and make me want to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Couldn't decide between the Gluten Free Pasta/Pizza( as the pizza was amazing the first time). So ended up getting both. They were both just amazing. The Gluten Free Pizza is the best I have had in the last three years that I have been gluten free!!!  Also wanted to tell you that your staff is amazing. Their customer service is out of this world. The other day my hubby got a pasta and didn't really like it and no questions asked , she apologized and took it off the bill.  Today we sat at the bar and the two bar tenders/servers were just unbelievable. They managed to balance serving all of us at the bar, checking out all the pick up orders, and answering  the phone for pick up orders and questions on wait times... Never did the the smiles leave their face and still gave us some one on one attention. I just wanted to take a few minutes and send you some positive feedback.   We have our new neighborhood place that we will be Frequenting a lot more ."}
{"text":"We have been here several times as a short walk from home.  We bring friends and family.  Service is friendly and food is delish.  Outside dining in good weather is a treat."}
{"text":"Biased in my opinion, but the food is excellent.  The go to's for me are pizza muffins, calzones, steak sandwich, baked spaghetti, zesty bread, chicken alfredo and Caesar salad.  Great for a lunch stop, bring the whole family for dinner or have an event in the banquet room.  Great prices, great food!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The service and the food is wonderful  Very good value  Everything is delicious  Especially the pizza"}
{"text":"So it was my first time trying pizza muffins and this place is my new top pizza place!!! I got their buffalo chicken half dozen muffins. And I thought it might not be enough and I was wrong; it was perfect in every way~ Oh and the price is super super super affordable. I also got their Cicilian Sundae and that was bomb also. My time there was amazing so I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Most reasonably priced, and delicious Italian food in Chandler. They serve pitchers of beer too! Bonus! Pepperoni Muffins are the bomb. Definitely on my list of places to go out for dinner from now on. Great low key vibe too :)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this place is poppin!  Whoa...  I met some friends there on a Friday night at 8pm for dinner and the place was packed!  Next time I'm going to make a reservation for sure!  We all started off by ordering the pizza muffins.  And just as I read on the reviews from other yelpers, they were delicious!  Full of flavor, delivered hot to the table and the marinara sauce was a great addition to the muffins.  They brought out ranch as well, which I thought was a nice touch as most individuals choose to have ranch with their pizza products.  For dinner I ordered a calazone.  It was made well, it was reasonably priced and I topped it with some extra marinara to add a little more saucy flavor to mine.  It was a big portion and I took 1/2 home.  This place will definitely be a place I frequent for some italian food in the neighborhood.  I highly recommend coming by and trying out the food here!"}
{"text":"So I have very much disliked any food I have had here. The teachers I teach with really like it though so I end up coming time and again because of them. To me, the flavor of all the entrees is just not very good. Haven't found a meal I like yet."}
{"text":"Not my favorite pizza. Just a little bland to me. The Sicilian cookie on the other hand saved this trip for me. If not, it wouldn't have gotten 4 stars. The service was great and they were really fast. Guess the pizza muffins would have been a better bet. The 6 dollar large on a Sunday though was hard to ignore."}
{"text":"Total fan for life.  My car battery died en route to pick up an order I placed, and it was well after Floridino's closed when AAA completed my roadside assistance. I sped over there to see if they'd still be open so I could at least apologize in person, and lo and behold, my order was still there, AND they remade it since my fiance called to update them what was going on.   Superb service, food was awesome when we finally sat down to eat. We ordered a small side salad (I think they upgraded me, another kudos),  a half dozen pepperoni pizza muffins and a calzone. The pizza rolls were buttery, just enough cheese and a great chew, and the GINORMOUS  calzone was inhaled in 1 sitting by my fiance.   Take it from an angry, pizza lovin' New Yorker, this is yummy stuff with outstanding service. Support your local joints, come visit Floridino's!"}
{"text":"Worst Chicken Parm ever (including frozen meals) but very good pizza.  I give it 2 stars. If you are an Italian place it is not acceptable to have terrible Chicken Parm...Sorry"}
{"text":"The pizza muffins have been our \"go to\" here but last night we decided to change it up a bit and order the family bucket of fettuccine chicken Alfredo based on Jenny Y's testimony. Oh boy was it insanely delicious ! Probably the best I've ever had. We ordered the size that feeds 4-6 and it fed 4 very hungry teenage boys and 2 adults...AND we have plenty of leftovers. A great deal, for $39 you get enough pasta, garlic bread and salad to feed a family, and then some ;) Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian places! The prices are right, the food is oh so good, and the service is great!  I usually order the pizza muffins as an appetizer and get a white pizza calzone... yum!  If there is room leftover the desserts are fun too!"}
{"text":"We had pizza here last night and it was awesome. Taste great less filling, lol, great customer service, fast pizza turn around time, friendly staff, Reasonable price, good quantity"}
{"text":"Very good local restaurant. It is smaller and very busy so on Fridays and Saturdays you need to get there early to get a seat for dinner hours. It is worth the wait.   Excellent food and great service"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza! Their portions are a bit small for the price, but it usually tastes pretty good. Can't wait to try their breakfast menu soon!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you.... I am from a part of California where I grew up with a lot of friends with deep Italian roots(food to be specific)... they take pride in their home cooked meals, and as a child I was the beneficiary of enjoying those authentic Italian meals. I've never loved food more than Italian. I've lived in Arizona for years and this place takes me back to that place as a child. This restaurant is amazing and what I love the most is your staff. All smiles and they make me feel at home. Thank you, Florindinos, you are truly amazing"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Get the pizza muffins if you go! Also great place to have a party, I had my 16th birthday party at Floridino's and it was great! Great food and service!"}
{"text":"This is not my first review of Floridino's.  I was very close to never eating here again after being served \"understuffed\" calzones 3x in a row.  The outside corners contained nothing the last three times I dined there.  The saving grace for this restaurant is the Pizza Muffins.  They are excellent.  The pizzas are really good as well.  I'll stick with one of those two when I go there.  My daughters love this place, so I can't avoid going there.  I gave an extra star just because my kids love their food.  Step your game up, Floridino's!  Do some quality control with your calzones!"}
{"text":"Ordered the calzone lunch special. Wow! It was big! It even came with a soda with free refills.  Crispy crust and just the right amount of cheeses and sauce. Yum! Definitely a good deal."}
{"text":"This is my place for great thin crust NY style pizza. Fast, cheap and super yummy. My whole family loves this place. We usualy get a cheese pie and a sausage pie. Both are 18'' $13 for the cheese pie and an extra two dollars for the extra topping. We get our pizza here every Friday."}
{"text":"Nice people, nice atmosphere, nice food. Would recommend to anyone working in the area and looking for a good lunch spot. They were quick to take our order and brought out the food promptly"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and wanted a pizza/pasta type of establishment for lunch.  I found this place via yelp and it was a great success.  I had the primavera alfredo and a small pizza (personal size).  Both were just what I was looking for.  Very family-friendly, casual.  Service was very good, and they were busy on a Friday lunch crowd.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Calzones are huge and delicious. Pizza muffins are a must! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I eat their pizza muffins on a weekly basis. They are great when served with their ranch sauce. Yum"}
{"text":"So many have raved about the food however I just don't see it!  I did not order the pizza which was the item that I was told to order.  Sorry, was not in the mood.  If your pizza is that good the rest of your menu items should be the same.  I ordered the eggplant and chicken parm.  Smalllll portions that was in no way homemade. The side of meatballs (that they charge an extra $2.00)  were out of frozen bag bag of mini meatballs that you can get in any freezer section!!!!! Even the \"muffins\" were so, so.  Olive Garden (really not a fan of) puts them to same!"}
{"text":"We eat here often! Amazing large calzones! The crust is fantastic and is so good!  Great place with great service!"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure what the fuss is all about. We probably made the mistake of getting the margherita pizza which was pretty much cheese pizza with tomato slices and a little chopped basil. I expected slices of mozzarella and full leaves of basil. The breadsticks were bland and disappointing. My husband said papa johns is better and he hates papa johns. Even the bread pudding was just okay nothing special."}
{"text":"The pasta sauce could not be more bland. Nothing special at all about this place. Our service was slow. The table we were at was in really rough shape. Have no idea why people think it's good. If you like Spaghetti O's you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Floridino's has many good attributes, including their service, their location, and their innovative dishes. The servers engage us and show real interest without sacrificing speed or quality. Floridino's is located in a low traffic strip mall so there is plenty of extra parking spots for when they are crowded. I have never experienced a time where I drove around searching for a parking spot. I simply pull into the lot and can find a parking space that is widely available. Floridino's has two delicious and unique dishes: calzone and pizza muffins. The first are the Pizza Muffins, an appetizer better described as pizza rolls. Bits of sausage, ham and cheese are rolled up in fresh-baked pizza dough and paired with a side of pizza sauce. The other must-have menu item is the calzone, which ranks among the best, and probably biggest, in the entire Valley. Out of any venue in Arizona, I believe Floridino's does an excellent job at being a one of a kind, Mom and Pop's restaurant."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in my decision to come here instead of going to the Floridino's in Chandler. I learned only after that the two locations are not affiliated in any way, however they have some of the same menu items. I have always gotten the pizza muffins. I've only tried a couple of other things from the menu but keep coming back to the muffins because they're so damn good. Needless to say, this location completely fails at the pizza muffins. I ordered two dozen ham & mushroom for myself and my boyfriend and every single muffin was primarily pizza dough...hardly any toppings. My friends also ordered the original pizza muffins and complained that there was hardly any toppings on theirs. They're also more expensive at this location. I ordered take-out and the girl that rang me up was very nice but that was the only good experience I had here. I won't be returning due to the quality of the food. Do yourself a favor and go to the REAL Floridino's in Chandler--the quality of the food and the price is seriously unbeatable!"}
{"text":"This place is Chandler best kept secret...but the word is out!  You might wait an hour on a weekend if you don't get there early...but it's worth the wait!  We love to come here for lunch or breakfast...the staff is great, the food is out of this world!  You have to try their pizza muffins!  Our favorite is the buffalo chicken ones and we love their Greek salad, but everything on the menu is amazing!  For desert, they have the Italian cookie, although they call it something else, but it's so yummy and the prices are great!  We love this place!  It's one of the few places our whole family can agree on..."}
{"text":"I went here and had a wonderful calzone and cookie covered in ice cream!  The calzone was huge.  The place was clean and family oriented with plenty of space between tables.  It was great for a group dinner!  Service was good.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have only ordered delivery here.  But let me tell ya, these guys are on point!  My deliveries have always been spot on.  Extra this?  Less of that?  Delivered.   I love the cheese pizza and antipasta salad.  I asked them to leave out the cheese on my salad (cause it's gross to me) and they subbed extra meat!  I love you guys!!!!    Fan for life"}
{"text":"I had the pizza muffins. They taste like pizza, really good pizza. Yummy and hot with marinara and ranch dressing. There calzones are delicious. There pizza rocks and lots of specials every day! Seniors Monday 2 for 1 dinners. Hurry on over for some tastes of Italy!"}
{"text":"Great crust on pizza and calzones good local joint."}
{"text":"I picked up an XL BBQ pizza, an XL pepperoni pizza, bread sticks with cheese and small chicken Caesar salad.  The pizzas had a lot of toppings and good sauce but I am not a big fan of the crust, which is really important to me.  If it isn't as good in the morning cold I won't go back.  The bread sticks were good.  The Caesar salad was ok, nothing special.  One thing that was strange was having tomatoes in it, I have never seen them in a Caesar salad before."}
{"text":"They are our go-to for excellent Italian food! Very affordable food, wine, and dessert! I love their homemade lasagna and we always get a cookie with icecream for dessert! I highly recommend Flordino's in Chandler!!"}
{"text":"Just moved to town and decided to try this place out. We loved it!! Service was great, our server was very friendly and helpful. Food was delicious!! I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I love to support local family owned businesses that run a great operation and knock it out of the park!   Floridino's gets it done on all operating levels.   This is a place you can go to on a date. If they call you back for a second date, they might not be a gold digger. So remember;  \" \"Jumpman , jumpman, jumpman, them boys up to something  She was trying to join the team I told her wait   Chicken wings and fries we don't go on dates!!\"  Sorry I digressed. So back to the question at hand..should I go? Yes.   I read review after review and all were positive expect someone that actually said they ordered from Grub Hub and she thought Olive Garden was better. That girl was just ridiculous. Rate grub hub down not this place you ninny.   Ordered the lasagna and it was really good. The sauce was very tasty and just the right amount of cheese. For a $1.99 got the Caesar salad and it was decent. I like lots of garlic in my dressing but that's me. This is a good little salad with fresh tomatoes.   The bread was sooooo good! I was using it at the end of my meal to clean my plate of all the remaining sauce. It's like a pull a part bread and not a traditional bread stick and I loved it.   Next item ordered was the Fettuccini Alfredo with veggies. The sauce was very tasty and never clumped or separated or was oily or greasy. It was just a very rich, creamy and smooth Alfredo sauce !!!   Kids personal pizza with a drink was an extreme value. So this restaurant is very kid friendly as far as single moms and dads going somewhere nice to enjoy a nice dinner out. Or just families like the Brady Bunch that want great food and are value oriented.   They have glasses of house wine that are a good value and I even saw a Malbec on the list.   I also like that they support local breweries like SanTan and Four Peaks but also have Mich Ultra.   The service was great. Most of the servers  were younger kids, but they were all about being attentive and providing a great overall dining experience. They are the frontline of any good restaurant. Hats off to management for training your staff so well. I always say smiles are free and accomplish so much.   You've captured me as a new customer and I will be back soon when I want to carb out!! Lol."}
{"text":"A very homy place, really a pride of Chandler. Nice and accommodating service crew from the moment you step in to the time you finish your meal.  Two signature food you must try: the calzone and the pizza muffins, there is a third one and it is already inclusive with the two orders and i'm talking about their marinara sauce which is just a bomb of greatness. As you try these flour-based items, take the time to taste the richness of their fresh baked bread, yeah, it's that good.  Bread and tomato - if you can't enjoy its creations on an Italian restaurant, then i say look for another one because these are the very basic ingredients that make an Italian cuisine unique. Try their spaghetti with meatball and you'll know what I'm talking about.  The place is almost always packed, so be be patient and be rewarded with a delicious meal. They have Seniors Night, Kids Eat Free and Lunch Specials, at any rate i still consider their pricing affordable and reasonable. Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my all time favorites. I've been coming here since high school (over 10 years).   Get the Calzone!! So amazing. If you haven't been here give it a try for some great Italian food!"}
{"text":"My family loves to go to Floridinos. It's a great place when we all get together (about 18 of us) or when we have family come in from out of town. They can always get us seated in a reasonable time and are quick with the service. It's a very low-key, no-frills type place. We usually just get a few pizzas and share. The white pizza with chicken is my favorite! I love garlic and the white sauce has a nice roasted garlic taste to it. The regular red sauce pizza is great too. If we are over on this side of town for lunch we like to come and get their lunch special which is a personal sized pizza, salad, and I think it comes with a soda? Not sure on the soda part. Either way the food is always piping hot, the salads are crisp, and the staff is always friendly. There've been times when I knew we were being loud or a bit obnoxious but they've always been helpful and kind. Great service, great food, great prices."}
{"text":"Just an average restaurant. With the exception of the baked spaghetti, which is fabulous, the food is not very good. Pizza is tasteless because the dough is unsalted. Salads are watery and mostly iceberg lettuce. Decor is plain. Looks like the interior of a diner more than that of an Italian restaurant. Service is good, although nothing special."}
{"text":"First of all, I've never lived or been to NYC so my review might not be helpful at all to the ultimate pizza lovers.  I usually like Papa Johns or Round Table Pizza so that should tell you my lack of expertise on pizza.  Now, if you still want my review, here it is...it wasn't my favorite.  Would we go back? Probably, NO.  If you want good Italian, try Vincitorio's.  *Shrimp Scampi Pizza......yeah...no, it definitely wasn't for me...it was more like hardened pasta and tiny, pre-cooked shrimp on bread. *Calzone - pretty good. *Decor - I'm definitely not used to the \"authentic NY\" style...."}
{"text":"We have been eating here since the 90's. Great food, love the pizza rolls. This place can get very busy during lunchtime, and weekend nights."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now recently to try it again. The first time was a rather busy time and I get the quality of service was lacking due to the rush. Of course we had a bit to wait, no big deal. And service was slow. I get it, the dinner time chaos.  The second time I went,  it was not during a rush and it still took a while to seat us and I was staring at several open tables, took a long time for the waiter to come by and take orders. Food is good for the value, typical Italian place and items. Though in the effort to be inventive, the doughy treats they created looked tasty on the table cards but it did not cook all the way through on our order and ruined my appetite. Both times the service was lacking and unfortunately I won't go back now. Not only for that but the restaurant itself is super small and they try to cram as many tables in there as possible. It's super hot inside too when it's packed. The ambiance for me in general was awkward and uncomfortable, you're so close to your neighbors so it felt a little invasive for me to be so close to strangers."}
{"text":"The food here is great and they have several reasonable lunch specials.  RIght around $5 gets you a drink and personal pizza.  Service is good and if you sit at the counter, you can bet that Mike or Chris will be there to greet you.  I would definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"We had a Floridino's by our house that closed so we started going to this location (it's owned by a different person than the one on Alma School and the one that closed).  It used to be really good, but the service has gone down so much.  If I could give zero stars then I would...it was that bad.    Took a long time for our order to be taken, waited and waited for food...about 45 minutes later we were given our bill before our food arrived, then our appetizer and salad came after we finally got (and finished) our pizza.    When I asked for a manager the waitress got an attitude and refused to get him, so I walked up to the bar where he was to tell him of our situation.  He said that they were busy (um...four tables is NOT busy) and that he didn't really care.    I told him we would no longer come to his place after being regular customers for years.  He said, \"Oh well, I'll still be here anyway.\"    Food is great, so we will only be going to the original location from now on."}
{"text":"Definitely try the pizza muffins! The interior reminds me more of a family restaurant, say like a Denny's, rather than an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I always leave floridino's happy and with a feeling of always coming back soon. Food is great, and I recommend the pizza muffins for sure. Service is always top class, very polite and helpful. They also have a lot of tv's so you can catch any sports games you want. It is a spacious place and can fit a large party."}
{"text":"I live in Mesa and wandered in by chance.  I am always treated like royalty and so is my family when we eat here. I am always surprised when I read super bad reviews of this place...and the people also mention the \"other\" place with the same name.  I went to the other place and enjoyed a meal there.  They were good....but seemed like less space. If I were the Yelp readers, I would try this place for themselves.  And for the person who complained about tomato sauce being on their food(they were allergic to tomato sauce)...why would you go there?....I am also prohibited from having tomato sauce...but in an Italian place I would order a salad without tomatoes and have breadsticks.  No sense setting yourself up so you can whine about the inevitable. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We just returned from Europe and swore we would never eat Italian food at a chain restaurant again.  we searched for a family restaurant with good food.  We went to Floridino's and had pizza and the pizza muffin appetizers.  Everything was delicious!!! We went early, they were almost full, a good sign.  The girl up front was friendly sat us right away and told us her favorites to order.  The service was excellent.  we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place, went there a lot. But my 4 year old daughter was throwing up the meat sauce lasagna from this place all night every hour for 6-7 hours, starting 5 hours after she ate it. She is fine again this morning, but went through the seven levels of hell last night. I called them this morning and was extremely polite considering the situation, sharing what happened and asking if anyone else had shared issues with the food last night. They were very uncompassionate, saying \"we are well versed in food handling\" and \"yeah a lot of people are getting sick lately\" like she had a stomach bug or something. She had a stomach bug for just 7 hours, exactly 4 hours after she ate your lasagna? Come on guy, I know you're not looking to take liability, but you can at least express a little concern about my child (and at least ACT like you're going to be more vigilant) if you're going to avoid taking responsibility. It's not like she had a $3000 hospital bill I was asking you to pay for, or like I was being rude or yelling. A lot of families go there, and I just wanted to give the restaurant a heads up so they could do whatever they needed to do for this to not happen to another sweet little kid again. Poorly handled aftermath AND food poisoning. My advice? Stick to the pizza rolls/dryer food items if you insist on going there. Stay away with the littler ones until they have a bit stronger stomachs!"}
{"text":"I've had Floridino's pizza muffins for lunch many times when I worked nearby, but have never dined-in (or tried anything else).  We decided to give it a shot and made the 35 minute drive!  When we arrived, there were a lot of people out front and sitting inside, we figured there would be a wait, but surprisingly we were sat right away.  Our waiter was friendly and answered all our questions.  We ended up getting the pasta with spicy pink sauce, a pizza, and chicken pizza muffins.  The pizza and pizza muffins were good (as usual).  The pasta was just ok.  We asked what made the pink sauce spicy and were very surprised to know that it was Sriracha.  I thought we were at an Italian restaurant?  Sriracha?  Really?  The sauce was also fairly bland as well.  Pretty underwhelming to say the least.  I think we'll get pizza muffins if we're ever in the area again, but most likely won't get anything else or dine-in."}
{"text":"Great food!  Wonderful atmosphere!  A++++! Pizza is great!! Wonderful to find a great Italian restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Good food, cheap, family owned.  Not much atmosphere, but the food and the prices make up for it."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here and the waitress was super nice and friendly. The cheese garlic bread sticks were very good. The downside....the pizza. It was soggy and greasy. Normally that doesnt really bother me however that plus the weird tasting sauce just made it sub par."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing and family friendly. For any new customer, I recommend the pizza muffins!!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard pizzeria. My family loves the pizza muffins.  The pastas and pizzas are great too.  We've never had a dish we didn't like."}
{"text":"Let's just start off been coming here since 2001 getting the same thing over and over again chicken Parmesan and a side of Alfredo it never gets old Hot food great price don't forget to order pizza muffins bomb.com"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing but if you want to eat today and not tomorrow order ahead of time. The service is very slow. The waitress didn't seeing to be moving with any hustle."}
{"text":"The special calzone is so yummy! I have been looking for a place that served their calzone with mozzarella cheese and not ricotta. Got to say this place is great! The cheese, marinara sauce and bread of the calzone-Amazing. :)"}
{"text":"Food was awesome as always and we seated in a fast manner. When we had 9 in our group.  Jeff gave us excellent service we were very pleased."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great value, and my wife may leave me for the chicken wing rolls.  Highest recommendation I can give..."}
{"text":"I was there last night for a group event and in the plus column there's the service, the huge private room and the service. On the minus side was the bathroom. I'd rather the bathroom smell of clean because it's clean than reek of aerosol deodorizer because it's not.  I can't say much about the food as we only had the choices provided, which were good. Someday I'll have to try the calzone everyone raves about."}
{"text":"Excellent food and prices! The lunch specials are fantastic. All the employees are super fun and give your experience and comfortable, familiar feel. I love eating here!"}
{"text":"I looooove this place. Super yummy personal pizza that fill you you up without leaving you stuffed. Such nice people, and they just recently updated it as well."}
{"text":"This is a favorite of ours when we don't want to spend a lot of money but still go out and have a nice time.  The employees at Floridino's are so friendly and welcoming, you'll feel part of the family immediately.  Just as an example of how affordable this place is, the last time we were there we had a half order (6) original pizza muffins, 2 bottles of Stella cider, 1 Sun Spot draft, and one 12\" pizza with sausage and mushrooms.  Total before tax and tip was $23.25.  Can't beat it.  I can see why they've been around as long as they have, and get as busy as they do.  Good food & drinks and always great service."}
{"text":"Try the pepperoni muffins and custom calzones."}
{"text":"My parents have come here about three times and finally convinced me to try Floridinio's. The pizza here was so crispy and flavorful. They wood- fire their pizza and it comes out hot it was so tasty too! It's definitely the best pizza I've had in a long time. What really made the trip worth it was the bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream- it was perfect for the cold weather. The only reason this wasn't a 5 star review was because of the service. The service wasn't bad! It just wasn't great. 10/10 will return."}
{"text":"Real deal Italian food in the Arizona Suburbs ain't the easiest to find, but Floridinos is always my go to! I love this place, have been coming here for years since I lived in Arizona and every time I come back for visits home! Their lunch specials can't be beat, the prices and flavors are amazing! I love their baked spaghetti and any of their pizza muffins are awesome! Be sure to expect a wait if you come during the lunch or dinner rush!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Floridinos!  We have been eating here for 14 years.  We started eating at one of their other locations in Northeast Mesa (since closed) and now go to the one in Chandler (the original location).  I've always ordered the manicotti. It's delicious and I always eat half and save the second half for lunch/dinner the next day.  My husband used to eat the special calzone at every visit but has recently started trying new things.  The environment is casual and family friendly.  It's always busy and you often need to wait for a table.  You can call ahead to get your name on the list but they do not take reservations.   Hands down favorites - PIZZA MUFFINS.  You will not be disappointed.  We go with the regular cheese muffins.  They are amazing.  Ask for a side of ranch and sauce to go with them.  Everyone raves about them.  We take many out of town guests and family members - definitely a hit.  Second favorite - PIZZA COOKIE DESERT. heaven.  need I say more?  Our kids beg us to come here for special occasions because the desert is amazing.    I'm also a big fan of coke products and love that Floridinos has them!  Bottom line, if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive, family-friendly restaurant, try it out. Kids eat free on Wednesdays too!"}
{"text":"After reading multiple Yelp reviews on this business, I decided to come here for the greatest hits: Pizza muffins, Calzones and Antipasto salad.  I thought the pizza muffins were interesting and a great alternative to bread sticks or garlic bread. They were loaded with TONS of sausage and ham and came with 2 different dipping sauces. Although a little greasy and re-heated, I appreciated the novelty factor.  On to the entrees, the small Antipasto salad (5.99) was absolutely filling for a one person meal. I didn't find it any different from any Antipasto salad I have tried before, but I think people love it for the dressing - which had flavor but A LOT of oil (more than half of the total dressing). The ingredients were fresh but there is nothing out of this world about iceberg lettuce and dry mozzarella.   The calzone was larger than a newborn baby and hotter than Phoenix in the summertime. Although the corners are mostly (if not all) bread the taste was very good and overloaded with tasty insides. The spinach ham combo my friend ordered was pretty satisfying and this meal could easily be split in 2 for tasty leftovers... if you can stop eating.  I found the teenage staff to be friendly and cheery but the bathroom needs massive help. Only one stall and really unpleasant smells, the female employee who had just left the bathroom as I entered left wet paper towels on the handles of both exit doors... covering the entire area for me to hold on to and pull. Just.... disgusting, especially from an employee who should be trying to keep the establishment clean and good looking.  All in all, good but not great. Its pretty affordable so if this is your price range, I think you can make it work and still have a tasty meal."}
{"text":"Good simple American Italian food. Prices are great. Service is pretty fast.  Avoid Wednesday night as it's Lowery organ test night. Loud old-time music. Not sure why."}
{"text":"I must've come here on a bad day considering all of the other glowing reviews. I've got two things to say about this place:   a) It's very affordable. b) Up until I visited this place, I thought pizza was like sex. That is, there's no such thing as bad sex. Well, the Floridino's pizza just kinda laid there.  I should probably try it again, even though my first visit was underwhelming. One more minor note, this place also has a full bar and it's the first thing you see when you walk into the place. Not sure why that survey question has been answered differently by every other user."}
{"text":"Another visit this time for business at lunch. Great deals at lunch from $3.99 which includes a drink. Service was great. Not rushed but attentive. Calzone was large and delicious and the pizza never fails. We will definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"Their calzones, salads, and pizza muffins are great!!! There pastas are okay, nothing special but still good. The atmosphere is very quaint and intimate. Perfect banquet room for a party or shower (I have been to both there) and the pricing is very good. The staff is always friendly as well. I have been going here for about 7 years and I will continue to go!"}
{"text":"This is a cool hangout spot if you're looking for a casual meal. I had the original style pizza muffins which were just okay, though they're what this place is known for. My calzone was a bit dry. Food is decent but not spectacular."}
{"text":"My review won't give a full representation as I was there for a painting event. The event was fun but it's hard to eat and paint.   I ordered their healthy choice. It wasn't bad and was priced reasonably.  It would've been nice to have salt for the veggies but again...we weren't at a table with those offerings. Between painting, I took bites but mostly it was cold by the time I could eat. The red wine vinaigrette lacked flavor so I switched to ranch which was good.   The people near me had the pizza muffins and said they were great."}
{"text":"In regards to pizza, this place is a solid 3.  I'd rate them a bit higher if they had delivery, but they don't.  It's probably the second best buffalo chicken pizza in the Chandler area(Rush Street is #1).  Their side salads are probably some of the best side salads you'll find at a pizza place.  Overall, good size pizza for a good price."}
{"text":"Mmmmm Floridinos! The calzone is the most amazing thing on the menu and I have yet to find a comparable calzone anywhere else.  In fact, I ate the whole thing and then felt so guilty that I had hike up to Siphon's Draw the next morning.  Fair trade off, I'd say!  Our group of 4 also enjoyed pizza muffins and salads, and all left happy and full.  A great, local pizza joint!"}
{"text":"One of the best fettucini alfredos I've had.  Ordered take-out on the last leg of my road trip because I just didn't have the strength to put on real pants and eat in a restaurant.  -Fettucini alfredo:  Delicious!  The sauce didn't just taste like cream and it had a good consistency.  Too many times I've had this dish and the sauce is like a soup.  The sauce actually stuck to the noodles! -Original style muffins:  I didn't want to leave this place without sampling their pizza menu.  A half order of these muffins seemed perfect!  They have a stellar pizza crust and the toppings were pretty delicious too, very good cheese. -Caesar salad:  What was I thinking ordering a salad?  Maybe the lack of leafy greens on my trip compelled me to do so.  They could've chopped the lettuce into smaller bites and well...SKIP!"}
{"text":"Meh! After reading the reviews and the number of times the wait was an hour or more, I expected much more.  The pizza was not much better than Dominoes. The pasta was ok, and the service left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Worst Italian food I've ever had. I've given it two tries and Everything I had was incredibly bland and tasteless. I tried the salad, spaghetti, meatballs, ravioli and Alfredo -not one dish was good."}
{"text":"My family LOVES thsi place! It's the only place my husband will get pizza from. We often do take out. Orders are ready in about 20 minutes or so. Pizza Muffins are AWESOME and so are the Calzones!  Great atmosphere when dining in as ewll. Definately recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"This is probably our most liked small Italian restaurant, and I can't remember over the past 6 or 7 years when we ever walked out disappointed in the food or the service they provided.  Although we have tried about everything on the menu over the years, their Pizza Muffins, Greek salad, and cheese bread seems to be a family favorite.    My favorite is their ravioli for a dinner size, or their Italian sandwich with a side of spaghetti for a slightly lighter portion.  Their Calzones are huge, pizza is great. Just makes me hungry thinking about it.  Whatever your taste, I don't think you can go wrong here.  Priced right.  Highly recommended for keeping me and my family so satisfied over all the years."}
{"text":"I'll get right to it. The portions are small. I ordered spaghetti and received a small dish with two small meatballs. You have to pay more if you want more meatballs. The only reason I'm giving this place three stars instead of two is because the service and ambiance is great. For the price, I could have had a far better meal at one of the regular places I frequent but my wife and I wanted to try a new Italian restaurant. Maybe their pizza is larger, better priced and tastier. The spaghetti really didn't taste all that great and my wife stated that her dinner was small and didn't taste all that great for the money. We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for business lunches, group meetings and family outings. The place has a very comfortable feel to it and the food and service are always good and consistent. Love the great lunch specials!"}
{"text":"This has been my go to spot for years. The food is homemade and delicious. My favorites are the calzones and the pizza muffins! Sooo good. I don't live in the area anymore but visit whenever I'm in town. This restaurant is a true gem, keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Sorry... I don't see what all the  fuss is about. I found the food to be fair. IMHO they use a lot of convenience items in the kitchen.  To the ownership, good food doesn't come out of a box.or a can  The service was very good"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to visit when I am in Phoenix.  Try the breadsticks with cheese and you will crave them forever more."}
{"text":"if you are looking for fine dinning italian and like speciality pizzas or creation, this place would prob be just a 3.  if however you are looking for a good italian place to have a pizza, a calzone or some nicely cooked wings, this is the place for you.  They have giant calzones.  come for lunch for their lunch special, a two toppings of you choice calzone and a drink for like 6.25 :)    Had their pizza and its pretty good too, it does not taste like a chain pizza like dominos and papa johns.  freshly made with good ingredients so its hard to mess it up :)  if you come here expecting olive garden, u will be pleasantly suprised.  if you come here expecting chain store food, u will be impressed.  I think because they get so crowded at lunch, it kind of makes it impossible for them to keep food and reuse them/ reheat it, and the ingredients will always be fresh and not sitting in the fridge for so long.  so, dun expect this to be a palce to move to chandler to, its not that great, but its very good enough to make your choice to move to chandler bearable and adds variety to your choice of places to eat over in the chandler area."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat while my car was being worked on up the street.... Not one person acknowledged me. Sat at the bar for 10 mins before I had to ASK for a drink/menu.... There were 4 tables in the place. Not busy by any means. The old lady working was Incredibly rude to say the least. Margret was very nice, she could tell I was getting heated from sitting there and not being helped. I work in the industry therefore I'm a phenomenal tipper. All I wanted was a beer and a salad.... Going to gecko.  I visit the one in Chandler often, the food is delish and the staff is very attentive. I recommend going to that one. Don't waste ur money here."}
{"text":"Love it here. A great place to hang out with friends and family. The food is always great, and the service is always fantastic."}
{"text":"I love everything here from the pasta to the Original Pizza Muffins. All of the employees are always super friendly which makes coming here even better. It can get pretty busy, but it is always worth the wait. They also send us text messages with coupons. Overall, we love this place!"}
{"text":"My family  absolutely loves this place. Everything taste delicious and the prices are reasonable. And don't get it Sicilian Sundae because once you do you'll be addicted.  I've tried many things on the menu, and I would be hard-pressed to say which one is my favorite since they are all so good.  And of course, the staff is always on point."}
{"text":"These reviews are cracking me up. They must be family members who are trying to keep this place in business. Please, do not go here if you want anyone to take your order or even acknowledge your existence. And more importantly if you want to enjoy a good pizza. YUCK! I have never seen employees walk in as miserable to be somewhere as I saw them walk into this gross, smelly, boring restaurant. The dude answering the phone at the bar actually rolled his eyes at the person trying to make a reservation for 14. We went out of our way to come here; what a waste of a pizza night!!  Awful experience, and even worse food! So bummed we spent any money here. Won't happen again."}
{"text":"I'm from New York so its really hard to find authentic Italian food!! i will say this is one of the many places i like to go and eat!! i tried the pizza, eggplant and butter squash ravioli and they were amazing!! i would come back!!"}
{"text":"Such good food and great Service! They have weekday specials. I usually do take out the food is always fresh and Hot! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pizza, again???  Oh, well, what else can a 5 year old ask for on a Saturday night!  We tried Floridino's (or Floridema's)  on Guadalupe Road.  We've been there before and enjoyed their Broccolli Calzones.    The interior is a little dated, but clean.  It wasn't very busy, but that's fine with us.  We ordered a 14\" White Pizza and a KIDS MEAL personal pepperoni pizza.  Just have to have root beer with all that!  The pizza came piping hot!  The crust is so light and airy with a crunch that you'd expect on the bottom.  My son ate half of his personal pepperoni pizza and loved it.  Saturday was Karaoke night and my son has no shame!  He sang Journey's \"Lights\"...  LOL!  Being his parents, we just dated ourselves...yikes!  I should start playing Skeleton Witch in the van to be more hip...is that an \"in\" word?"}
{"text":"I recently had my sister's babyshower in their banquet room and the event manager took such great care of us from our beginning communications all the way up until the day-of. There was a nice large-screen TV available for our slideshow to run on, very nice table linnens provided, and even extra tables when we needed them. For the price, food quality and time availability, this was defintely the best deal in the area for our get-together! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love Florindinos with all my heart. I've been going here since I was a kid and still have their pizza frequently. Lovely family restaurant with staff that has been there for years. Their pizza muffins can be personalized and delicious!"}
{"text":"Pizza Muffins! If you go here, order a dozen. They're pinwheels of ham, sausage and cheesy goodness! You wont be disappointed. TRUST!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot. Very affordable and family friendly. Portion sizes are huge. I love that they have specials throughout the week. Kids meals are very affordable. My favorite thing off the menu is the chicken alfredo. My favorite appetizer are the pizza rolls, the ranch and marinara for it are like crack. So yummy!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try the pizza muffin because everyone is talking about it (on Yelp too) but overall its really just okay. There isnt anything special that they add to it, its just pizza in a different structure. The regular ones have sausage inside but nothing really special about it.  The pizza was average, cooked perfectly fine but flavor combination of toppings and crust was just decent. Definitely solid pizza but nothing that stands out, sort of like the Pizza Muffin. If you want a safe pizza place that will not disappoint but wont blow your mind either, this place is fine for it."}
{"text":"I've tried to like this place because I live close.  The prices are reasonable and the staff is extremely courteous.  But... I've tried numerous pasta dishes and found them all lacking.  The red sauce is too sweet, the Alfredo is bland, and the \"pink\" sauce tastes  somewhat like spicy nacho cheese.  Which might be ok on tortilla chips, but not butternut squash ravioli.  My advice: stick with the pizza muffins.  They're great!"}
{"text":"My now wife and I had our first date here and we have  frequently visited the restaurant over the past 8 years to the point that a few of the staff know us and always say \"see ya next week.\"    Last night, we had Floridino's cater our wedding. My wife and I would like to thank you so very much for helping make our special night that much more magical.  Sarah was amazing to work with and made the whole process incredibly easy for us.  Thank you, again."}
{"text":"Started off with OK service the waiter we had was pretty rude and inappropriate. Other than that the food was really good my husband and I both ordered calzones (which were enough to fill up four people). I would recommend going to this place for fast Italian food but not the service."}
{"text":"Always a treat. The only thing that I can complain about is how crowded it is, but hey that just means its good! We always get their pizza rolls with ham in them. They taste amazing and make amazing leftovers too. They alone are enough to make a meal. I've also had their pasta which tasted very good. I do wish they would make it a bit brighter in here, though."}
{"text":"Best calzone around.  Great lunch menu.  Able to support large groups well.  This is a locally owned community friendly restaurant.  Did I mention the calzone?  Nom. Nom. Nom.    Awesome to see fixes to large group service.  Have had multiple large groups on busiest times recently and the service has been FLAWLESS!"}
{"text":"Great for lunch!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this place for lunch.  Go here often for lunch, they're quick and have GREAT lunch values.  The calzone is HUGE and you can get it (along with a drink) all for $5.99.      It always gives me at least 2 meals.   Along with being a great value,  the food is also very good.    I did not give the 5th star because I really think you need to have all aspects of your resturant be great to be rated  5 stars.  I planned a going away party for a coworker recently and he wanted it to be at Floridino's.  I called to talk to them about out up & coming lunch going away party/meeting and discuss # of people to confirm they would be able to accomodate us.   The guy told me he can write us down but they get very busy at lunch and he cannot guarantee us a table.   Having been there for lunch on multiple occasions I can confirm they get VERY busy.     I can understand if a company does not accept reservations and I explained that to him, but I was bringin 12 people down there  for a work lunch and we couldn't wait for 45 minutes, if they couldn't accomodate a party that size over lunch that was ok, but I needed to know.   We ended up going and got seated just fine, but I would certainly not say the planning staff was easy or all the pleasant to deal with.       I'll still go here for lunch often, but would shy away from any bigger group outings here in the future."}
{"text":"Decent pizza and great antipasto salad. The thin crust pizza lacked in flavor. Not enough sauce or toppings even though I ordered extra cheese and pepperoni. But it was good. The antipasto salad we got to accompany the pizza was definitely the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"For some strange reason I was craving fettuccine alfredo so instead of going all the way to Olive Garden or trying alfredo from some random place like California Pizza Kitchen, we decided to try take-out from FloriDino's. We'd ordered pizza muffins from here before because we live in the area and didn't want to drive all the way to the Chandler Floridino's for them. (The pizza muffins are not as good at this Gilbert location, by the way)  Well, we were less than impressed. My boyfriend got the baked spaghetti with meat sauce and I got fettuccine alfredo with chicken. I tried the BF's baked spaghetti and it was just okay. My fettucine alfredo was totally BLEH. The noodles were overcooked, the sauce had no flavor and the chicken was grey! Chicken isn't supposed to be grey, right? I had to add a couple shakes of my own parmesan cheese, salt, pepper and garlic powder to even give it a taste! Needless to say, I did not eat the chicken so I can't really comment on it's flavor.   I don't plan on coming back here and will be driving to the Chandler Floridino's for my future pizza muffin needs."}
{"text":"We had fantastic catered food. There was a hiccup with the order that caused an inconvenience but we were compensated more than fairly. Can't wait to try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The pizza muffins are fantastic - get those and an antipasta salad with a glass of wine and you will be happy!!!  The antipasta salad has lots of vegi's, salami, cheese, and a fantastic italian dressing.  The pizza muffins are rolled up pizza dough, sausage or ham, cheese, and they give you 2 dipping sauces with them.  The pizza and pasta are also good at Florindino's.  Great mom and pop family local Italian restaurant that you must try."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is consistent and high quality, and the prices and service are excellent. They are often busy and the actual restaurant decor, etc. is nothing special, but you are there for the food, right?"}
{"text":"It's so nice that there's still hometown restaurants. And especially this one, it is so delicious! Favorites -spicy chicken salad, sausage and mushroom pizza, pizza muffins, calzone, and their lasagna is to die for!"}
{"text":"The place is always packed. I don't get it? I've been there twice in the last two months and both times have been less than impressive. Overpriced for the puny portion sizes. And salads are sliced iceberg with toms and cucs plopped on top.  At least the waitress was great."}
{"text":"Worst pizza we have ever ordered. The crust was plastic like and tough. The pizza was not cut into slices and the toppings just slid right off because the sauce is so watered down. We will never get pizza from here again. We were so looking forward to having pizza today and bummed it was so bad."}
{"text":"Extremely average. I was a little disappointed based on the yelp reviews.  I just got a small pizza to go for lunch and here are my overriding impressions: -The pie itself was incredibly underwhelming. It could have been something from my old university cafeteria. Really greasy, cheese that slides off the base crust, and a decidedly rubbery crust.  -Located in a strip mall in a part of town that time seems to have passed by. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the theme is continued inside the restaurant. Just uninspired.  -Understaffed... maybe. I stopped in at 2pm, and there only seemed to be one person serving the entire dining area. That said, he helped me as quickly as could be reasonably expected.  Now, it's true, the prices are pretty good. AND I didn't try the calzones which so many here have raved about. In any case, I'm not motivated to return here any time soon."}
{"text":"Pizza, good Zesty bread, good Spicy chicken salad, good Pass the plates and enjoy!: )"}
{"text":"Great food!! Nice little family restaurant.  Been going there for years, always a great experience.  Owner Dema always great us with a smile."}
{"text":"Today we had a going away luncheon for a coworker at Floridino's. Most of us ordered off of the luncheon menu. For around $7 the items were a great value. Even though they were slammed at lunch time and we had a large group, we had excellent service.   I had the two item calzone with sausage and ricotta. It was just ok. I just thought it was dry and didn't have a lot of taste.   On a previous visit i had the Pizza Muffins. They were awesome! I would highly recommend those instead of the calzone."}
{"text":"This place is my family's favorite.  We eat here once a week. I love the atmosphere, and the feeling of being part of a big Italian family when you're out for dinner. The service is great the prices are low. We love it here."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up.  I tried a white pizza which I enjoyed and a pepperoni for the kids. Pepperoni was a little greasy looking but a lil dab of the napkin and it's just fine. Besides it's pepperoni theres bound to be some grease.This place was very busy when I stopped by that night. Looked like a great place to go to with a friend to have a beer n watch the game or even to bring the family and friends out for dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is usually good. Pizza is fabulous! Eggplant was from freezer n def not fresh. Sauce is decent but from now on will only order pizza...."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place!! The pizza roles are amazing. I've had the pizza, calzones and cannolis all of which are extremely delicious."}
{"text":"Food is very reasonably priced and also pretty good quality. They open at 11 and have some great lunch specials. Definitely worth a dine!"}
{"text":"This place is nice and all but when a family of seven comes in with three children one having to be in a high chair and you put us in a booth in the back corner and expect us to squish together is kind of ridiculous.  Need to find some employees with more common sense than that. All I have to say."}
{"text":"Delicious. Great service. Wonderful choice of Italian favorites and specialities. I love the bread they serve with the meals. Nice atmosphere and didn't have to wait to get seated. My husband has trouble walking and we were able to park right in front of restaurant."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and me went to Floridinos on the weekend lunch time. We got seated quickly and our waiter was very friendly with us. I got the spaghetti with meatballs which is my favorite Italian dish and she got the penne with spicy meatballs. Needless to say, Floridinos never failed us again! As always, the dishes were tasty and with the right amount of tomato sauce.  A weekend lunchtime well spent at Floridinos. We will be back"}
{"text":"Not my first visit here, but it's been a long time.  Got the two-item lunch special calzone.  Basically it's like a pizza folded in half.  I found the flavor to be fine.  Not spectacular, but fine.  I finished mine.  Portion was reasonable, though they could put a bit more \"toppings\" inside.  Several bites were just bread.  Can't say I'm a fan, but their food is OK.  Far from the best Italian restaurant around, but not bad."}
{"text":"This was referred by a friend. Thought it was fairly good. The service could use a bit more training and the wait was a little longer with when literally nobody in there was a bit mind boggling but I have to say the food was great. The Jr calzone was amazing. We also ordered these little pizza muffins that were way good. We will definitely come back here for the calzone and maybe the pizza (which I hear is great)."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest here.  This is my third terrible experience this week eatting out. And this is one of my FAVORITE places. Its one of the few great locally owned restaurants that has diet coke. The baked spag and pizza muffins are amazing. 2 of my all time favorite foods that I can only get here.    But I feel the need to report a problem.  This is the second time this has happened sour cucumbers in the salad. I know I'm a pain in the ass  because I always ask for extra.  And the service is great in this place. One of the best in the city. But this is the second time this has happened.  Once I can understand but twice.  There is simply no excuse.  And too top it off tonight our eggplant was raw. I know it was busy and accidents happen but the cucumber thing really angers me its gonna be a long time until I go back.   I feel very guilty giving this place one star but I'm upset."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza joint! Great lasagna.. Salads, breadsticks, and top notch desserts"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Love the pizza knots. Always busy and great environment. I do wish the staff was a bit more more friendly at times. Not that there mean but sometimes pretty dry. Love the food."}
{"text":"Gonna advertise yourself as a pizza and pasta joint you better figure out the pasta part of the occasion.  Had the chicken parm.  Worst.  Ever.  Pasta with a sweet Chef Boyardee like sauce, small piece of chicken that was obviously pre-breaded and frozen.  The chicken was cooked but the breading was basically just gummy and uncooked.  Bad.  The \"pizza muffins\" are a joke.  I hope their pizza is actually good.  Sure, price is cheap, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The family and I love this place.  Services is always so friendly, the owners are super nice and like to talk with the patrons.  If you go, you must try the pizza muffins - yummmmm.    My personal favorite besides the pizza muffins are the calzones.  Very large, perfectly cooked and you can add what ingredients you want.    We all think the pizza is very good.  They even have a white sauce pizza that even my kids enjoyed.    This is a can't miss place"}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. So much so that we catered them for our wedding. Nothing but good things to say! Reliable, affordable, and great customer service. Will be using them over and over and over again!"}
{"text":"Florindinos is my favorite Italian food spot!  The baked spaghetti and salad are outstanding here, maybe even delectable to the point of being worth a longer drive from another city even!  Portions are good Prices are more than fair Device is usually pretty good  This place gets literally packed with people!  Definitely worth a taste!"}
{"text":"Floridino's is one of my favorite lunch spots!  They have awesome lunch specials and the food is always good. $5.99 for a ginormous calzone & a drink - yes, please! No matter how busy they are, the service always seems to be quick and the servers are friendly.  I've never had anything here that isn't good. If you've never been here, do yourself a favor and order some pizza muffins. You'll thank me later :)"}
{"text":"A must go for Italian style foods. The dishes were large and delicious.  Loved the sauce and the pizza muffins.  Ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and the sauce was awesomely thick. Highly recommend Floridino's to family and friends.  Look forward to another visit."}
{"text":"Average quality, barely, and lacking in taste and originality. The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.   There were a lot of families here... they must have cheap kids menu or something."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Brought my girls here for the first time!!  They NEVER disappoint! We had the friendliest waiter and it seemed he read our minds on anything  we needed before we asked. The food was delicious!! You HAVE to try to pizza rolls!! The salads are HUGE, we shared one with all 5 of us. This will definitely be one of our favorite spots!!"}
{"text":"Great parking, easy access to the highway, amazing food- their male bartender working was cold and abrasive. Wouldn't smile, wouldn't greet me, acted like I was mentally ill for asking if they served hard liquor, wouldn't change the channel for me- had a female do it for him instead like he was to good to acknowledge that I needed help.. Etc. I recommend the place- if that tall, dorky and moderately handsome fella isn't working."}
{"text":"Such a great first experience, calzones was huge and so good! Not bad for under 10$! My wife and I split it and it was plenty for dinner. The non happy hour beer was priced well, $5.50 for a half pitcher."}
{"text":"I love this company, always on time and I have never had a bad experience at Floridino's. Their staff are friendly, and they know my name/regular order. I have never had a bad experience at the Chandler location!"}
{"text":"I had Floridinos cater my daughters wedding in 2012, and it was a very good experience. My son is now getting married , so I thought I would reach out to them again for a quote. I was very disappointed that after leaving 3 messages for the catering department, I never did a call back."}
{"text":"This place is a family favorite! Very casual, great prices, excellent food. Their dishes are simple and comforting. Just a well rounded restaurant. We don't even live in Arizona but when we come to town we always make room for Floridino's.  First things first, order the antipasto salad as a starter. Their calzones are a must. The fettuccine/w chicken is consistently delicious and you can never go wrong ordering a pizza. Don't forget the pizookie for dessert. Yummy, yummy for your tummy!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite! Food is amazing, staff is prompt and courteous, prices are great and it's locally owned by a family that supports the area!"}
{"text":"The food is good , our server was wonderful!! The hostess was one of the rudest people I have ever met!! If we hadn't been waiting with a large party we would have left!!  I will order take out from there but won't ever go in again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an affordable banquet hall for an occasion, this is the place to be. My family reserved their banquet room for a baptism, which fit about 50 people. Their food is good, especially their pizzas! Their service is wonderful as well.   I am all about supporting local family businesses. This place has been opened for years ever since I was like 7 years old (from what I remembered) and it is still around. That tells you something, people just enjoy coming here because of their food and service!"}
{"text":"A new date night spot! Me and my husband were looking for a good Italian restaurant besides Olive Garden and we were VERY happy we found Floridino's. We ordered the breadsticks with cheese and they were some of the best I've ever had. For our entree's we both ordered calzones and like a previous reviewer, we too thought they were \"understuffed\" but still very good.   The prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly. We'll definitely try them again and hope our calzone's are a little more stuffed next time!"}
{"text":"I got chicken parm with ziti. I like this place for fast italian food. I usually bring it home and add seasonings though as can be a little bland. I like the free bread they give but ask for a side of marinara."}
{"text":"This evening we decided to embark in to a local take out adventure. My wife and I had an incling for Italian. About a mile away from our home in Chandler we are always driving by Floridino's. We decided to give it a try.  My wife had the raviolis with meat sauce and I ordered the baked spaghetti and asked that they add a chicken cutlet into the bake. I also asked if they had any good appetizers for us to share, the gentleman on the phone recommended there pizza biscuits so I figured I'd give them a try. The cheese raviolis were tasty and the meat sauce was rich. My chicken spaghetti bake was very cheesy. The chicken was a 3+, not garbage but could have been a bit moister. I was very impressed with the pizza biscuits; they were very greasy but thats probably why they were so good.  Overall we were really impressed with the food and the order was prepared in about 15 minutes. I definitely plan on including this place in our everyday choices of regulars we enjoy."}
{"text":"Lots of hype but zero flavor. Lots of food but low quality ingredients. I was really looking forward to eating there too! I don't know if the cheese was imitation or just really really bad. My plate was overflowing with food, which I like but not worth our families time or money. VERY DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! My favorite Italian place. The kids love the spaghetti and raviolis, and we adults have liked everything we have ordered. Great atmosphere, and service as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here!! The pizza muffins are delicious!!! But coming in today, on a Sunday, when it's not too busy, my girlfriend and I chose to sit at the bar so we could both watch the baseball game. After getting drinks we were completely ignored by the guy behind the bar. He took a few phone calls, looked at a few menus with another staff member, but never asked us if we were ready to order, if there was anything he could do for us, didn't even look our way. I asked to be moved to a booth, and we were. Our order was almost immediately taken, and before I could finish this post we had our salad. I'll still get food from Floridino's, but from now on it'll be take out, and it'll be much less frequent."}
{"text":"Had a couple of pizza rolls & some salad on Plant Nite. Food was tasty. Service was fantastic. Floridino's has it down. I wish this was closer to home. Kudos to management, back of house, & service. I will come back when I visit the East Valley."}
{"text":"Great pizza good pasta. The pepperoni muffins and bar b que chicken muffins are the greatest things on the planet. They are so tasty. Staff is super friendly and helpful, they went above and beyond to make my 7 yr old daughter feel special."}
{"text":"We just happened to be driving by and we were hungry so we popped in here. The parking lot was packed and after eating, we know why! The atmosphere is very welcoming, staff is outstanding and friendly and the food was amazing! We ordered the sausage and ricotta calzone, combo pizza and original style pizza muffins and they hit the spot. Service was fast and friendly, food was great and the cost was reasonable! We will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Floridinos was OK.  The atmosphere is definately nothing to write home about, but I somewhat expected that.  We started with the Pizza Muffins and some \"famous\" breadsticks.  The pizza muffins were outstanding!  If I ever came back, I would eat only these!  The breadsticks were definately not \"famous\", they were nothing out of the ordinary.  I ordered a white calzone, which was pretty good, but I thought it was very strange that a chopped up breaded chicken patty was used for the meat?  This place makes it's own handmade alfredo sauce, but we get pressed meat on a patty when it comes to chicken?  Very Strange!  The calzone was average, with way to much dough in proportion to the filling.  One dining companion got the Egglplant Parmesan, and said it was terrific, the other got a salad.  The salad was pretty disappointing as it arrived in a very small bowl, and again was filled with a chopped up pressed meat breaded chicken patty.  The highlight of the evening was the Sicilian cookie dessert, this probably redeemed the whole meal.  It was SO good!  A warm half-baked cookie topped with ice cream, whipped cream, and hot chocolate syrup.  Next time around, it would be pizza muffins and cookies for me!"}
{"text":"Just got back from lunch after church on Sunday. It tells you something when the place is packed and people are waiting outside. This place is a gem in a fast food world populated primarily by chains serving the same ol' stuff. This is a legitimate neighborhood eatery churning out food not found anywhere else...yahoo for diversity. This was my 3rd time back and I had never tried the pizza muffins and decided to give them a shot. Oh baby, an order of those and a salad is a GREAT meal! Unfortunately I ordered a calzone to split with my wife....too much food! But, was it ever good! Everything has that handmade, mom and pop look ...and taste...to it which is delightful. I may even go back for Senior night if I can find one of the BOGO coupons out there. Definately a place to put on your dining experience list. Highest praise!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was 14 years old, and this place has yet to fail me. The service, the food, the atmosphere... everything is absolutely amazing. Anyone who rates Floridino's less than 5 stars needs help. Thank you Dino's for the amazing food and service!!"}
{"text":"My family and friends and I have been eating here for a long time!  This place is never a let down.  The food is top notch, the service is excellent, and the employee's treat you like family.  I have never had a substandard meal nor bad service.  You don't want to miss the Pizza Muffins.  Honorable mention goes to the Deluxe Calzone and the Antipasto Salad.  The pizza is really good too!"}
{"text":"We have been to this location 3 times.  The first time there we had lunch & the restaurant was practically empty. The second time there was to pick up a pizza I ordered online. When I got there they said they did not get the order. The person behind the bar checked their computer & saw it. He apologized & started making the pizza. We were given complimentary water while we waited. There was a \"band\" of 2 old men singing at the front of the restaurant & it was pretty busy. The third time we were there they were about to close & the waitress was very friendly. The pizza is what I would consider New York style because the slices are very large so I either have to eat it with a fork or fold it to eat by hand. The calzones are very large (as you can see in a picture from a fellow reviewer). They do have a large patio but since it is AZ I am not sure how much use it gets. I have not seen anyone seated there in the three times I have visited."}
{"text":"Does not disappoint!  Found this place on accident and it is my new favorite place in Arizona!  Worth the wait!  Great service.  Great food.  Don't miss the yummy bread pudding!"}
{"text":"I love Floridinos. Food is good and service is great every time we go. To the reviewer talking about fake reviews.. sorry but they aren't! I have had QT pizza and as far as gas stations go it's the best but it isn't better than Floridinos. Besides pizza though this place has some other great dishes like the baked spaghetti and pizza muffins. Also, the bread that comes with the pasta is always delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool little place with some unique menu items, like pizza muffins. Service is very friendly.  Our white pizza with chicken and spinach was pretty tasty and the crust was nice and flaky. (Most of) my party seemed to enjoy their meal and it would probably be a place we'd visit again if we lived in the area."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new Italian restaurant to go to and ended up at Floridinos.  We had a large party and did not have to wait too long.  Our server was excellent, god was good. Loved the pizza muffins. Restaurant wasn't fancy but the food was good, service was great as were the prices. Definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Delicious food; excellent service; bargain price.  What more do you want?  I guess I would love for the calories not to count when I eat there.  We had the pizza muffins to start...super good...better than I thought they would be...I dunno the name threw me off..  Then  I had the chicken parm (my go to item) and the cheese was just so perfectly melted on my delicious cutlet of chicken!  yummm..  My bf loved his meal too...I don't remember what it was but I do know we both had stuff to take home...  tasted just as great the next day...  The service was wonderful....like the best I've had in a long time anywhere!    The tab was the same as had I used a groupon elsewhere except I didn't even have to use a groupon...they are just so well priced!   Love this place.  I am for sure going to the gym..and then going back!"}
{"text":"We come here a lot. My kids love their pizza and calzones while I opt for the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and we share an order if the jalapeño cheese bread!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"This Is a great place to get some quality italian good without breaking the bank. With prices of their plates usually around $7, this is a great restaurant to go to if you want to get the most bang for your buck. Portion sizes are great and the quality if the food is also very good. Not super fancy or anything super special, but it is quality food at a great price."}
{"text":"Wonderful family style dining.....chef modified my pasta primavera to fit my super picky taste. Very nice staff. Great cheesecake! Will definitely be back when passing through agai"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Floridino's for many years even though I didn't live in the area. It was one of my parents' favorite restaurants so we would come here nearly every time I visited. Even after my Dad passed away my mother would bring us here when we visited her. Now they are both gone but my middle daughter lives in Mesa so we come here occasionally. I finally bought a mobile home to stay in when I come to visit my grandchildren and it isn't too far from here.   I recently found out Monday night is senior night, buy one, get one free or if you are by yourself, half off one meal. I've been here twice recently and enjoyed both meals. When you get half off your meal you can splurge and order something else with the money you saved. The first time I got a glass of Chianti and the second time I got a Greek side salad.   I was extremely impressed with the service, especially the first time. That waitress was so sharp that when I realized I needed something I glanced up, saw her working across the room pretty far away, and the instant she glanced up and caught my eye she started over toward me. I haven't had that happen in years. Unfortunately, my experience in too many places is at the servers wisk past you without making eye contact and if they do glance your way they act like they didn't see you. Why is that? You would think they would want to provide good service to get a good tip. The second trip wasn't quite as good, I had a man who started out great but then it took forever before he came back to see if I need anything and bring my bill and a to go box. I think they should have all servers trained under the gal I got the first time. Maybe I will start asking to be seated in her area.  I don't necessarily think this place has the best Italian food I've ever had but it's always decent and I will probably keep coming back here just for the sentimental value of remembering my parents in a place they enjoyed so much."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's really good Italian at a great price. I've had nearly everything on the menu and it has all been great every time. My regular meals are the Lasagna with spicy Italian sausage, garlic bread with cheese, pepperoni pizza rolls (muffins)?, their pizza is also among the best. Super tasty, I've turned probably 20 people onto this place over the years, ALL are now regular customers. We drive a pretty long way round trip to go here on the weekends when we go..... Luckily the place is \"kind of\" on the way home from work, so about once a month, I'll stop by and pick it up for a dinner treat for the wife and I. The place is always clean including the restrooms, (one of my pet peeves). Like Italian? You'll love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and gi-gan-tic portions really make this pizza place rock! Try the foot-long calzone, or the antipasto salad that easily serves two.   Floridino's is almost always busy (which is generally a good sign) and the tables are rather close together, so perhaps take-out is a better choice."}
{"text":"Here we go again.... well it started with as an office party as do many of these places we go too.  So we were in a rush for lunch (only have an hour and the bosses were eating too).  The staff nice and friendly very helpful and had some pretty good jokes at times.  We were a party of 10 and we all want our food and drinks FAST, and FAST is what we got... This place ROCKS... food was very good and the portions were HUGE, they have these little pizza rolls that are made like cinnamon rolls they were really tasty... I always order the Calzones because I can't even finish one and there really good.  The food came out Hot and fresh and fast as can be.  3 different folks helped to bring it out, so that we could all enjoy our meal together.  5 stars...  I would have given them a 6 if there was one.  Oh and did I mention, we all paid separately and that was not a problem for this guy he was knocking us out.  Clean, descent parking, friendly staff and good food ... \"fa-get about it\"  \"Emoneyblue Approved\""}
{"text":"I have tried the chandler location, but had not been here yet.  Taste is pretty close to the original. The prices and lunch deals are different Mc but it's still a good value. Great calzones and the Pizza muffins are . Very nice find so you don't have to drive to chandler. 5 minutes away from my house means that I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I eat gluten free and as many of us know, gluten free products usually don't taste nearly as good as their wheat counterparts but this place has by far the best gluten free pizza I've ever had. The prices are also great! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for a few years now and hadn't tried this place until recently. I needed an emergency pizza, and it is in walking distance for me. The pizza was really good, so my girlfriend and I decided to go there and try it out. It's a nice place, and they had the football game on, so I'm already liking. Then I find out they have Santan Sunspot Gold! Hello! Really? You had me at Sunspot! You mean I can walk 5 minutes and enjoy a Sunspot? OMG! If they can fill growlers I'll really flip out!  Ok, on to the food, did the pizza muffins, since I ate like 5, I'll say good! She got the 3 cheese ravioli and I got the antipasto salad. They were both superb. We got the brownie dessert, and went home and lapsed into food comas. My only small complaint was that the lighting seemed a bit bright, but the service was really good and prompt. The waiter knew the menu and was very personable. The gf is already asking when we can go back. So it's a winner. I also run into friends here and see a lot of them checking in. This will definitely be a new regular haunt."}
{"text":"LOL I must have been in a food euphoria when I wrote this as I referred to my \"husband\" whom I was already separated from and divorcing ... weird.  In any event, I've been back several times since and am addicted to their amazing baked spaghetti with meat sauce.  Always take 1/2 home but it is soooooo fantastic especially with their garlic \"bread\" which is basically pizza crust.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"First timers and just fell in love!  The pizza rolls are to die for and we just had cheese this time. Spaghetti and meatballs, butternut squash ravioli and salad...wonderful!!! And we will be back!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!!! I've ordered this pizza over and over, consistent and doesn't disappoint!  Great price fast service and delicious, this is our go to Friday night pizza! Yum."}
{"text":"My wife is from Chandler and every time we come out here to visit her family I always look forward to grabbing a calzone here. Also can't forget about the pizza rolls for the drive back to San Diego. I'm hooked to both of  them so much I've never really tried anything else. Anyways, highly recommend the pizza rolls!"}
{"text":"I had the regular spaghetti with marinara and meatballs. And the meatballs were good with the sauce but the sauce alone with the noodles was HORRIBLE the marinara sauce tasted like packaged ketchup from in n out! If I were you I would just order the Alfredo like this old man was raving about in the restaurant or have the famous baked spaghetti but I've had way better! I'm never going there again customers were giving me weird looks... So overall my experience at this restaurant was uncomfortable and the food tasted like a frozen meal cooked in a microwave! Do not eat here!!!! I'd rather eat a gas station mexican breakfast burrito"}
{"text":"Pretty standard Italian food in my opinion.  We went for my friends birthday and had a party of about 24.  She had called ahead to let them know we were coming, and when we got there they wouldn't seat us until everyone was there.  Then when they did seat us in a little section in back, they wouldn't let us push tables together which just made for awkward seating.  The service was great though.  Drinks came out quickly as did the food.  The food isn't anything special.  We had a margarita pizza which was fine, but I've had better.  The greek salad my friend ordered looked blah.  Iceberg lettuce and WAY too much feta cheese.  My BF said he got a stomach ache from the pizza he ate.   This is my friends favorite restaurant.  I don't think we'll ever go there unless we're attending an event."}
{"text":"We recently had lunch here.  The food is very good, but the restaurant is far from perfect.  1.  We arrived at noon yet it was very warm.  According to a sign on the door it said to close the door to keep everything cool.  It seems they have a/c issues.  2.  We both ordered calzones.  My girlfriends order was wrong.  The waitress says the cook has often gotten orders wrong.  We had to wait 10 mins to get correct order.  3.  There was only 1 waitress.  There was a large party.  Trying to get her attention was a challenge.  4.  I only got 1 napkin and could not get any more.  You would think a pasta place would have more napkins??  5.  Even though our order was wrong we were charged full price, nothing was comped.  We were also charged $1 for ranch.  We were never told the ranch cost money, and most places give you ranch for free  6.  The bathroom was really gross, but ironically cooler than the eating area.  With so many good restaurants in Gilbert I see no reason going back to this place."}
{"text":"Known for originating the pizza muffin. The staff are the best around, and there's very little turnover in this friendly and welcoming neighborhood place.   Prices are reasonable and quality is very consistent.   The local paper has a coupon for buy one, get half off on another entree. But, really no other local spot beats their lunch prices.   I recommend the meatball sandwich and the spicy Italian sausage calzone."}
{"text":"This place is amazing my family and I come here about 2-3 times a month and we have never been disappointed. The staff is VERY friendly and the owner is always there he always comes and asks us how our meal is, we have never had anything close to a bad experience here. And the food here is even better the pizza is the best in town if not the best in arizona. We will always be customers of this place even if we move out of town we would make the drive just to have a good meal. Thanks guys you rock."}
{"text":"This place isn't even Floridino's!  It's now Dema's, though they never changed the sign.  I'm pretty sure they are leeching off of Floridino's established good name and reputation.  If you follow the ACTUAL Floridino's on facebook, you can read about it.       at one point, I actually liked this restaurant until I found out how many issues they have had  with health inspection and sub-par dining standards.  Now I'm just disgusted... Also, in the 2 years I'd been going there, I noticed a high turn-over with the staff.  And sadly, it seems the service has really suffered because of it.          They give a bad rep to the wonderful Floridino's on Alma School and truly aren't even half as good.  Their only saving grace is the sweet older Italian lady who waitresses there.  The only reason they get even one star is because she's wonderful, the kind of service you come back for.  I just wish she worked at a nicer restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  The pizza muffins, Sicilian sundae, and spicy chicken pizza are just orgasmic.    The service is great and the owners are always doing fantastic deals and staying in touch with their customers on Facebook.  They actually read their feedback and respond personally, which is amazing.  And sometimes they'll have cute deals like \"Tell the host \"Steve is amazing\" and get 20% off.\"  =)    Great service, even better food.  Don't be confused with the knockoff Floridino's on Guadalupe, they're not affiliated, which is why you won't find the same satisfaction and heaping portions.    Floridino's on Alma School, best dining in the valley.  five stars all the way around!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner!  Be sure to try the original style muffins as appetizers. They are awesome."}
{"text":"A huge two-item calzone with a drink lunch special is delicious and a great deal. Great service too! We love Floridino's!"}
{"text":"Good prices, decent food. It should be noted on the menu that there is meat in the pizza muffins, but it is not. As a vegetarian, this would have been vital information to know. My calzone was alright, nothing special, but I might return for a pizza. Will update when I return."}
{"text":"Amazing food, always great service, don't usually have to wait too long for a table at dinner time. Try their pizza muffins, you won't be disappointed. They have awesome prices too. My fiancé and I eat here quite often and are really looking into their catering for our wedding."}
{"text":"Love the food, staff is friendly. Have eaten their for years and the quality has always been at its best. Never have had a bad experience. Buffalo chicken muffins, skillet cookie, calzones..... well I can keep going and going are all a must try. The only negative thought I can have is they don't deliver!!!! Still can't go wrong with take out or eating in. Have to place them as one of my top 3 favorite places to eat in the valley."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious here!! I've had it all and love it all. They also have kids eat free on Wednesday's and are always running deals or specials.  Cheap, homey, delicious. One of mine and my husbands 3 dinner places that we always pick."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere, quality food, friendly staff, decently speedy service.  I first came here when I was in high school and it was great even then.  Now, it is a frequent work lunch spot.  It's slightly small and generally packed and lunch time, but waits are never horribly long.  Your typical menu of pastas, salads, subs, but the thing they're famous for is their monster calzones.  SERIOUSLY, you must come here and try one.  The crust is lovely, the fillings are always flavorful.  And they are just HUGE!  So do yourself a favor and bring your friends.  This isn't the place you'd take your significant other, because it's lacking in atmosphere.  But if your main objective is to chow down on calzone, you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"The reviews are pretty spot on.  I ordered a pizza and those yummy little pepperoni muffins.  The muffins were amazing.  The pizza was . . . just ok.   I've had many friends tell me that Phoenix just isn't a pizza area and mostly everything is mediocre.  I'll agree with that.  I chose ham and roasted chicken for toppings.  The ham was extremely salty, thin, and watery.  Not really appealing. The chicken was also salty.  The dough itself was kinda limp and not really my style of pizza.  I'm sure better options exist for pizza, but I haven't found one yet.  I was impressed with the service though.  The place was PACKED on a Saturday night.  My waiter was quick, attentive, brought refills often, and the food was out pretty quick."}
{"text":"The place was pretty empty for a Sunday evening.  That is probably why the waitress was attentive to us. I ordered a lasagna which was good but small for $10. The entire plate was smothered with sauce but only a little bit in the middle was the actual lasagna. Their pizza was good but the other dishes aren't worth $10+. So the service was good but I didn't get my money's worth for a simple dish."}
{"text":"Excellent value and yummy eats!  Very good pasta dishes and the bread and marinara was great too.  I added a tossed salad for $1.79....great price.  Many happy people eating pizza, which looked great, and several others coming and going with takeout."}
{"text":"Well I ordered a calzone~ it was delicious. Nice staff. Very busy, which I did not expect at all. Fairly friendly and they have a little bar as well. I had the privilege to be sitting next to the manager's wife. She was able to clarify that this is a family owned business (20 years or so) and the owners are still very much a active participants.  I used to come here with Joyce, an old colleague of mine that has since passed away. Which was my motivation to come in to begin with. A little reminiscing. I will say not much changed ~ and that is such a good thing. Apparently it gets a bit slower and quieter senior night. Can't believe it, but I'll need to call and find out when that is again. Monday's I think? But don't take my word for it. Call and check it out yourself!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants in Chandler (better than Olive Garden) The food is always delicious and the portions are great. You will leave happy and the unlimited bread sticks are phenomenal. And cant go wrong without the bar, and the restaurant is now more spacious ."}
{"text":"Kids eat free on Wed. We usually go on Wed, therefore. They are often packed at dinnertime.  At first, I had a hard time finding something I liked--I didn't like the pizza, and I didn't like the fact that the salad was full of iceberg lettuce. I finally found my favorite--their alfredo pasta primavera with chicken. My hubby and son like the pizzas, and my friend loves the meatball subs. I haven't tried a calzone here, but I hear they are good. The bread that comes with the pasta is wonderful, as long as it's not cooked too long.   We mostly get great and friendly service here, and they have coupons in various places. Found one in a Mexican free newspaper that my hubby got. Found others on the Chandler town calendar you can get at the library or parks and rec.   Other good things--our 1yr old likes tomatoes, and they let us order just tomatoes for him. We've never been charged extra for a bowl of cut-up tomatoes for him.  AND the cookie sundae? mmmmm...fantastic. Baked chocolate-chip cookie w/ vanilla ice cream and whipped cream and chocolate sauce on top, to share.  Also, there are TVs with sports on scattered throughout, as well as at the bar area (where you can also sit and eat).  Something to improve on: often they forget to ask if we need a high-chair or booster seat; then we have to ask and I feel like I'm imposing because they are always so swamped."}
{"text":"Had our staff Christmas party here and what a great job they did!!! Beautiful decorations were provided...surprised us. Server did a great job accommodating 20+ and they allowed us to bring in our own desserts. Their food was delicious...fettuccini alfredo to die for and lasagna, not for me, but everyone else raved."}
{"text":"Well my daughter and I went in for lunch. We arrived at 2:13pm. We were seated and the table was not too clean. The hostess came over and asked for our drink order. I asked which lunch specials came with a drink she then informed me that the lunch specials were over at two.  I told her I thought the lunch specials lasted till four. I asked her if they would honor the lunch specials since it was only 13 minutes after two and was told no. I explained to her that I would leave if I didn't get the special, She shrugged as if she didn't care and we walked out.   The sad part is that I eat at this place three maybe four times a month. The food is great and the staff is always friendly. I'm really disappointed. I hope they were happy that Wendy's got my $16 for lunch."}
{"text":"Standard Italian restaurant. I'm more of the healthy type, and was sad to see that salad/side salad with any entree wasn't included. Manicotti was good but simple, good wine prices."}
{"text":"What's OK:  I don't go to places like this for lasagna, pasta, or your typical generic Italian dishes.  They are usually a waste of an order 90% of the time anyway, and Floridino's is no different.  Those dishes are just fine.  The pizza is... OK.  Sandwiches... not bad.  The good here is value.  The prices are what they should be when you go out somewhere and order a plate of spaghetti.  But you aren't going to order that anyway, right?  What you need to get is an antipasto salad, some pizza muffins, and absolutely a calzone.  I'm not coming here without getting a calzone, they are great.  Combine that with the reasonable prices and locally-owned, family friendly atmosphere and I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Amazing food,  amazing customer service,  clean. If I had one complaint,  they are often very busy,  but they still do a good job getting people in and out."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid, it's soooo delicious! I usually order the Ziti Alfredo pasta with added veggies, comes with a large size of freshly baked bread. Mmmm!! My boyfriend gets the lasagna and says it's \"the best he's ever had\" Oh and you HAVE to get the pazooki (large warm cookie pie with ice cream on top) at the end. My sisters and I use to fight over that thing, it's so dang gooood"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for lunch before working out at crunch. The calzones are huge and great. For the calzones you can get 2 free toppings. This restaurant also has incredible pizzas that are excellent."}
{"text":"Great pizzas and Greek salads, $8 for a large on Sundays! The best cannolis...yummm! Friendly family atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have never been to a pizzeria that is literally packed all the time. That already says a lot about this place. Excellent food and service. We order pizza here every week and we love it.   They have a private party room that is booked every time I'm there. Looks fun!!  We'll keep coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Prices were good, didnt have to wait for a table after stopping in with my family on a late saturday afternoon. HOWEVER, I kept it pretty simple with the chicken parm and was thoroughly disappointed. I think Chef Boyardee made the sauce, it was that bland and distilled of much taste. I am willing to go back for their lunchtime sandwiches on a recommendation and because so many people seem to like the place, but it may just be they havent had decent italian food in AZ much! Just because its got a decent Italian name for the restaurant does NOT mean its worth a visit."}
{"text":"OMGoodness!!! Food was SO good!!! AZ native and my first time here, don't know why I waited so long!! Original Pizza Muffins were delicious and so cheesy! Caesar salad was fresh and crisp, 10\" Supreme pizza was perfect for 2 people (6 slices) and NOT GREASY!!!! So hard to find a good pizza place in AZ! I can't wait to come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Floridinos on way home from work for some take out. Staff was very friendly and food was excellent.  Ordered the pepperoni muffins and and the lasagna with a couple of meatballs and both were great. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Came here from California looking for some pasta.  Great pizza muffins and breadsticks. Good service too."}
{"text":"This is just a great family owned pizza joint and I love it! The pizza is always hot bath and really really good with lots of tea. I have not tried the pizza muffins yet but I hear they are to die for! I think I will have to try them on my next time around. But honey let me tell you the pizza will make you slap your mama! And the service is awesome too I normally like to sit at the bar get a glass of wine or beer and have my pizza there!"}
{"text":"When I saw pizza muffins mentioned in other yelpers reviews I had to check it out for myself.  The boyfriend and I headed to Floridino's for a late lunch on Sunday. It didn't take us long with the menu because we were there for one thing - pizza muffins of course! We ordered a half dozen and a caesar salad.  The food came very quickly but when the server put down the muffins I was surprised. While they looked great, they did not look like muffins. I was expecting a popover type thing. This was more of a pizza roll cut into slices. But like I said, they looked good so we dug in. Each slice is loaded with cheese, sausage and ham and it's served with marinara and ranch for dipping. They had a good flavor and were very filling.  The chicken caesar salad was good too. Lots of chicken and croutons, which I like. We got the small and it was plenty for two people.  In the end our bill came to $10!! (We didn't have drinks) Only $10 for real? Awesome! There aren't many places that aren't fast food where two people can get full for $10. What a killer deal."}
{"text":"Food was decent, not fantastic. We did the muffins, calzone, and a couple pastas. Nothing bad or over the top. Cleanliness was about a C-. Very crowded. Friendly staff. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Floridino's is a great place to come when you have a craving for Italian food!! Located in an unassuming shopping plaza this definitely seems like a hole in the wall. I hadn't been here in several years since I've moved to the Bay Area now but it was just as good as I used to remember.   The calzones here are out of this world and a really good value especially for lunch! Lunch special for a two item calzone and a soft drink is $6.89!! Another must order are their pizza muffins mmmm... basically like a cinnamon roll except filled with delicious savory ingredients. Don't forget to get extra marinara sauce because it is tangy and warm. The pizza muffins are Cheesy, fluffy, and doughy and everything you love about pizza in a 'muffin'. I haven't had that many of the other options here but did try the fettuccine alfredo with chicken breast which was on point. Cheesy goodness with tender chicken breast that just melts in your mouth, it even comes with a side of breadsticks!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have delicious pizza, pasta, and beer.  I don't know what they put in their pizza muffins, but the thi"}
{"text":"Tried a small (10 inch) white pizza with black olives & feta cheese . ($11) The crust was soft and chewy but very light ! The white sauce was perfect with garlic and spices . I would definitely order pizza again , next time I want to try one with their red sauce . My bf ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce ($5.99) it came with a basket of garlic bread that he said was fantastic . The spaghetti looked pretty basic to me but he seemed to love it. Bottom line ...good food,  great prices . *** They run senior specials on Mondays, kids eat free Wednesday's ***"}
{"text":"This was our first time there. Service was good. Our waiter was pretty attentive.   The pepperoni pizza muffins were fantastic.  Crispy on the outside, gooey and delicious on the inside.  I expected them to be fluffy and bready like a muffin, but they were more like tiny pan pizzas.   I had the eggplant parm. The eggplant was battered and fried to perfection. Not greasy or floppy like some places do.   My husband got the baked ziti. He thought the sauce was bland,but he tends to like his food spicy.  He loved the bread they brought out with the meal, whereas I though that was bland.   The kids ravioli must have been good because my 5 year old ate every last bit, which is rare for him. My daughter ate every bit of her fettuccini Alfredo.   Overall, it was a good experience. Food was decent. I'd go back and make a meal of the pizza muffins.  4 stars because the host clearly saw that we had a baby, and didn't offer us a highchair. My husband had to wander through the restaurant looking for one."}
{"text":"SO good! The white pizza is my favorite and the best white pizza I've ever tasted! I love Italian food and I'm very picky but this pizza is one in a million. It's a great place to go in a group because you can order a bunch of different pizzas and it's so cheap! It's a great family place as well. I highly recommend this place especially if you like pizza. It is kinda hidden. The outdoor patio is super nice especially when it's cooling off. They also have amazing carbonation in their drinks!"}
{"text":"Great food, drove all the way from Buckeye to try the pizza muffins. Friendly atmosphere and amazing Italian food. I will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite family Italian.  When dining for Six it can get pretty expensive especially for Italian.  NEVER HERE. Prices are very fair and portions are good.   Favorites are Pizza muffins and Calzone is best in Town.  Pasta dishes are great. Never disappointed and always satisfied."}
{"text":"Great pizza, wonderful pasta, and the best manicotti too. It's your typical cozy neighborhood Italian restaurant with great food and it's a well kept secret. Very busy every night but extremely fast and you are never kept waiting"}
{"text":"Pizza muffins hands down are the best thing on earth! Growing up in chandler this is mine and my family's favorite spot! Their beer selection is amazing! Pasta, salads and pizza of course you can't go wrong. PIZZA MUFFINS!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this location expecting it to be like the Floridino's in Chandler. Two totally different restaurants with the same name. Food is extremely bland at this location, water tastes like mud, and the restaurant is filthy.  Chandler location is the total opposite. Excellent tasting food and great atmosphere. Go there instead!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. One of my favorite places to eat. Their pizza muffins are super delicious! The only reason I gave this a 4 star and not a 5 was because one time I had went and I ordered the spaghetti. Most of the time its delicious but the last time it was like chopped up noodles that were cold in a square form. It was like someone cut up the noodles and put it in a container then put it in the fridge for a while and then microwaved it for 30 sec before serving it to me. Other than that one time everything was great. Employees are super nice and its just like a nice relaxing place to eat."}
{"text":"I've been back a couple of times recently since my last review.  They've raised their price slightly on the lunch special, but the calzones have been much better.  Whatever they changed originally, must have been corrected.  Still a great dine-in lunch for the price and the service is still very good."}
{"text":"The banquet room was perfect for our daughter's graduation party. They set it up to our specifications, the food was delicious, and the service was excellent. Thank you for helping to create a very memorable and joyous event."}
{"text":"It was so hot when we sat down at 8:30pm, we asked if there were problems with the AC. But it turns out the owner turned off the AC when he went home that night, 2 hours before they closed. The pizza muffins and the pizza were burnt. The server was very nice and doing her best. There is no affiliation between this place and the Floridino's on Alma School. This place was not good and not having on the AC, when it's in the 90's already is crazy."}
{"text":"The food here was really good.  Their pizza muffins are yummy!  Definitely recommend trying them and my fiancé raves about them.  I got a simple pasta dish that was delicious and he got a salad.  We both enjoyed our meals and will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been in that parking lot a 1000 times and never ate there... That was my mistake. Enjoyed this little place a lot. From Lindsey the waitress whom was very kind and took great care of us, to the Fettucine and Spicy Chicken Pizza. Okay the booth seats need padding... but I didn't go there for padded seats, after all i have padding there already (lol).. I went for dinner. It was much better than I expected and I have to say that we'll be ordering ahead and picking up on the way home from work for dinners. That pizza was the best buffalo style pizza we've had and we eat it about once a week.  This is a BIG THUMBS UP!"}
{"text":"I had my rehearsal dinner here and the staff was fast and accommodating! Beautiful banquet room! Food is SO good!"}
{"text":"I work less than a block from this place and go here all the time.  The food is good and there is always plenty of it...  A very nice local watering-hole and family restaurant.    The lunch specials are the best.  I can eat till stuffed and get out the door for less than $10.  The lunch specials are popular, so there can be a wait to be seated.    I love the baked spaghetti here so much that my wife and I had this catered for our rehearsal dinner.  We fed 35 people for less than $300, and everyone really enjoyed the food.  I HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Always get great service and no matter how busy it is there is never a long wait after you place your order . :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a Paint Nite party.  Bought the Paint Nite on Groupon and ended up here because we liked the painting that was being offered.  We had heard from a few people that the pizza muffins were a must so we were excited to try them.  We had the original and spicy chicken pizza muffins and they were just OK.  Nothing wowed us about the pizza muffins.  To be fair though, that was all we ordered so I can't speak to the rest of the menu.  Our server was very nice and attentive but a couple of people behind the bar were a little dismissive of us when we tried to order some drinks.  Overall, this was a decent place a Paint Nite event (nice, large side-room) but we weren't wowed by the pizza muffins as we were expecting."}
{"text":"Hands down the best manicotti in the valley and for more than fair price. If not in the mood for pizza or pasta the oven baked, open faced, super steak sandwich is absolute spectacular!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Pizza muffins are to die for. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with spicy pink sauce which hit the spot. Both of my friends had lasagne and had nothing but praises. I recommend Florindinos. Our waiter Randy provided great suggestions and was very attentive."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing when it comes to pizza and pasta!! I really recommend this place to anyone who is in the mood!!!"}
{"text":"Had this for a breif meeting and it was so great! The house salad dressing had so much flavor. &the chicken pizza rolls so tasty. Nothing not to love about this place."}
{"text":"Famous for their pepperoni roles  (muffins ).  Original Italian sauce and really great tasting cheese on ziti. Incredibly friendly service.  SanTan beers.  AND they have an event room.   Decent Italian food."}
{"text":"Had the calzone and the pizza rolls as recommended by my coworkers. They claimed the food was amazing and it was really good, but I think there's places closer that I'd rather visit and it's just as good."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Excellent prices.   Amazingly excellent Pizza Muffins!"}
{"text":"BOMB!!! There pizza muffins are to die for!! I literally order them for pick up like twice a week!!"}
{"text":"super excited to find an Italian place that does delivery and carry out.  all three entrées were delicious and my favorite by far was the baked spaghetti.  food was perfect temp by the time I got home and the food was ready exactly when they said it would be, which is impressive for a busy Friday night.  store is located in the Mesa part of chandler but the food was top notch"}
{"text":"I'm standing in line at Whole Foods for our family Friday pizza night with a have mozzarella and pesto and half veggie pizza ready to rock and roll. This woman behind me in line mentioned that the pizza smelled good so I offered her a slice.   We got to talking about pizza places around the valley, Pomo, Cibo, Bianco's, etc which tend to be more Neapolitan style pizzas. She told me how good Florencias was which when my wife and I were in Florence Italy we definitely missed  their style.   We decided to check this place out and the pizza is authentic. The sauce on the margarita pizza was extremely flavorful and our waitress was great. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 4.8 stars, but only because there is nothing special about the atmosphere, it's really plain.  Other than that it's perfect.  The only thing I've ever ordered there is the calzones, because they are amazing.  I've heard from others that everything is great though, especially the pizza muffins and the bazooki dessert.  Being a calzone fan, whenever I go to a restaurant that has calzones, that's what I will get.  Floridinos' calzones tie for rank number one currently, and I've had calzones from about 10 different restaurants.  These ones are really big!  This time I got a ham, pineapple, and ricotta calzone.  I can usually tell the food is great when I close my eyes while eating it because it is so good.  My friends say it looks like I am making out with my food.  The service was great and quick, I was surprised at how quickly they brought our meals out, and I was in a group of 8 (That said, it was around closing time so they had less customers and probably wanted to get rid of us...something that can be advantageous at most restaurants).  Also, they have a lot more space as they recently added 2 good-sized rooms.  You can't beat the prices here either.  I got my 3-topping giant calzone for less than 8 bucks I think.  A very friendly and attentive wait staff.  Insider's Tip: They have some amazing lunch specials, Mon-Fri, 11-2.  The best is a 2-item calzone with a drink, only $5.75."}
{"text":"Amazing food all around! Service is always good and there pizza muffins are to die for I've been coming here since high school and it's always delicious"}
{"text":"I have been back a few times since my first review. The first time I must have had a bad day or the cook did. The pepperoni pizza here is the best in Chandler. Staff is very nice and efficient."}
{"text":"Two words: Pizza Muffins.  This was one of the first restaurant I tried in Arizona when I came out to school.  As I'm from Chicago, I'm semi-critical on Italian food. Floridino's is simply to die for.  Good for broke students on a budget, you can get 6 pizza muffins and a side salad for $6. I've had some of the pasta there too and it's delicious.  Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Not impressed in the slightest. Terrible customer service. They messed up on my food order and didn't care to resolve the problem and charged me extra. My waitress was snobby and rude. Overall I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Hmmm.  Usually I only leave 5's and 0's...  I guess I have to adapt and make my rating more applicable.  Food was awesome.  Seriously...Compared to what my mom makes...pretty spot on.    The service (Gina) was impeccable.  Can't say enough good things about her  So...with my new rating system, I give this place a 4.  I definitely liked the food and the service.  But compared to Dominick's (which is a 5), i can only give this place a 4.  Even thought value for the dollar is waaaayyyyy better here.    UGH! I feel so guilty.  I love this place.  But it's in a strip mall...  sorry...  But seriously people, if you don't want a snobby dinner and want to have great \"muffins\" and service, come here!!!!"}
{"text":"Floridino's has really good food! I usually enjoy the ravioli with Alfredo sauce and it is awesome. The owner used to be a customer of mine at my old job and was always so nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Solid sicilian style pizza. Super friendly staff. It's a large dining room with lots of capacity. They have craft beer and wine, too."}
{"text":"Calzones are huge and delicious. Love the deluxe/meat calzone and the white/spinach. Bread/dough is really good and their red sauce is really tasty too. Hubby's favorite is the pizza muffins (which are more like pizza rolls rather than muffins). He makes happy food noises as he eats them. :)  We typically pick up food to go, but  have eaten there several times too. Your typical family restaurant. They have a few TVs up and I think are trying to catch the happy hour/sports fans. Servers are friendly."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. On the outside and even inside this restaurant isn't exactly aesthetically pleasing. The place was packed and people are everywhere. They have more tables then they know what to do with. Don't give up though the food ends up being worth it. The wait really wasn't that long for being a Friday night at dinner. Waiting is somewhat of a cluster though. You have people all over the place waiting. It was a cluster for sure. They should work on that. Once seated our waiter was friendly and accommodating. We all heard the pizza muffins were to die for and they lived up to that for sure. I wish I would have just eaten a bunch of those for dinner. They ended up being better than my main course. I wouldn't be surprised if you were full after those though. I ordered a pizza and it was decent, but nothing worth ordering again.  The people I was with ordered the calzones and absolutely loved them so next time I will have to get that. They seemed a little small for my hunger on a Friday night but not if you ordered the pizza muffins before. Overall this place was pretty good though. Definitely get a good amount of food for what you pay for. I will come back."}
{"text":"Most things I've tried here I liked. The baked lasagna, a spaghetti and pepperoni calzone, pepperoni rolls, and the breadsticks with cheese and jalapeños are all really good."}
{"text":"The pizza rolls are pretty dern good. The calzone is just ok. We were told the meatballs and breaded chicken is not made fresh which is a disappointment to me. Its good but when going out, Id prefer fresh made ingredients. Its good for a quick and inexpensive dinner. Haven't tried the pizza. Husband has had the baked spagetti which is pretty good."}
{"text":"Take a walk with me. Close your eyes. Picture a cinnamon roll. Replace the dough with pizza dough. Now, replace the cinnamon with cheese and any topping you can imagine. Finally, instead of dipping this in frosting, taste the home made ranch and marinara sauce. That, my Yelpers, is a Pizza Muffin.   Besides the Pizza Muffins, their Italian food is quite authentic. I have had a little of everything, and I have yet to find something I don't like.  The staff is great. It reminds me of a Chicago bar where everyone knows your name, except they really don't know your name. They are extremely friendly and always willing to give you suggestions.  For dessert, the pizza cookie is a must, and after all of that, you can walk instead of roll out of the door, I will applaud you."}
{"text":"They usually have a wait but its understandable once you taste the food. Everything is very tasty and fresh- especially the red sauce- so good! I liked the neighborhood feel to the restaurant and the vibe inside feels welcoming and friendly. Service was good, food was great, and I'm excited to get back for another dinner soon!"}
{"text":"This place is the definition of that down home family owned restaurant. Have been here multiple times and service can vary. To get a true test of this place come during lunch time to not be disgruntled to leave during dinner rush hours. I have not had a bad meal here and take out is also a good way to go \"call it in\"."}
{"text":"So much food for the price. Great variety of Italian food, salads, pizza. The atmosphere is very family friendly, although they do have a bar seating area. Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Not even close to the Original Floridinos (the one on Alma school and chandler).   To be honest, the only reason we go to this place out is to tease our taste buds, and save some gas being in Gilbert and all.  Food and meh at best, and a little pricey.  We just need more itailian restaurent in Gilbert,"}
{"text":"The pizza rolls at this place are absolutely to die for. I live in Seattle, every time I visit my boyfriend in Chandler we make at least one stop here. We usually create our own dozen with bacon, ham, and pineapple.  110% recommend."}
{"text":"We dined here many years ago and I have no idea why we let this place fall off of our radar. We were looking for something different the other night and found Floridino's on yelp so decided to give it a try. There was just about a 20 minute wait, not too bad for a Saturday night and a party of five. Our waitress was friendly and efficient and the restaurant, although a touch dated, was clean and comfortable. Tables in the area we were seated (just to the right of the entrance) weren't smashed together so you actually had a little elbow room to enjoy your family and your meal. The food didn't take long to be served and drink refills were done promptly. My family raved about the Alfredo sauce and my daughter very much enjoyed her pizza. Guess we'll be back. Thumbs up from this fam!"}
{"text":"My family and I have frequented this family owned gem for as many years as I can remember. The food is always consistent and delicious (we love everything from the pizza rolls and pastas to the awesome sandwiches). The establishment is casually quaint, clean, and always welcoming with great service."}
{"text":"First time here. Yelp reviews gave me high hopes. I was going to try either the highly reviewed calzone or interesting pizza rolls. Looks like a cinnamon roll with cheese and pepperoni in place of cinnamon. I opted for the calzone. I am thinking this was premade waiting to be cooked. The ingredients were a little light. I was expecting more. The cheese was mostly absorbed into the bread. The pepperoni and sausage were average. The crust was very thick, very heavy and doughy. It was cooked although very dense. The ranch dipping sauce was very good. The pizza sauce was nothing more than sauce from a can. No spice, nothing added, just red sauce. If Yelp had 10 stars this would be a four. I might try again to try the pizza rolls. For this review 3 stars; the lunch price was awesome."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and so far I can say it's the Calzones that keep me coming back..  I've had the various pasta dinners, which were ok.( not bad, but not great either).  However, I have been going lately about once a week with a coworker during lunch and their calzones are delicious every time.  Reasonably priced especially during lunch hours (5.99 for a two item Calzone with a drink). Can't beat that.  And every time I have really enjoy my experience from the service, staff, and quality of the food. I have recommended this to other friends and will continue to do so.  Definitely a good place to go and support a local business."}
{"text":"Great food at a relatively cheap cost. Cannolis are amazing here!   I usually order the ziti with meatballs.  Orders come with fresh bread."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times and every time the food is 5 stars all the way just wish they were closer to us.  They also have great lunch specials"}
{"text":"Floridinos Pizza NEVER disappoints!! Great pizza, salad and these little appetizer rolls that were the perfect compliment!! So good"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza muffins, very unique. Great family environment, highly recommended......"}
{"text":"Most amazing Italian restaurant!  I live easily 20 minutes away from this location (all freeway) and I will make the drive every time! I even pass a different Floridinos location to come to this one.  Any item on the menu will never disappoint, but  2 \"must have\" items are  Pizza Muffins, a starter  Baked cookie, a desert   I love everything about this place. The staff is friendly, food is to die for.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Came for the first time tonight for their $6 large pizza special. My hubby and I got half cheese half pep. We also ordered the pep pizza muffins. Everything was fresh & delicious. Love love love their sauce. Prices were so reasonable. Waitress was pleasant. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Here in AZ for vacation and trying to stay away from chain restraints and try some local spots!!! This place is hands down amazing .. prices are great, service is fantastic and food is delicious! We had the pizza, chicken Alfredo, and spaghetti  !!! I am definitely coming back here on my next trip back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Chandler so I need to rebuild my list of great spots.  I ordered online tonight for Floridinos and it was a great experience.  Online process was easy. I ordered spaghetti with meatballs, pizza muffins and a drink.  I drove up at 6.30pm on a Saturday night and the parking lot was packed.  I thought oh no - I'll have to wait but I didn't wait at all.  Food was hot and ready with a separate pick up line.  Spaghetti was really good but I've been living in PA and the pasta there is better.  Pizza muffins were incredible.  Plenty of food for less than $20.  I will recommend it to others and go back again for pick up.  Too many people too close together for me to want to eat there."}
{"text":"I have to say, its so nice to find what I consider, a great family resturant.   They have a great menu selection, and the atmosphere is relaxed and warm. Great family dining.  Being that its an italian resturant, I feel that they serve all of the great traditional italian food, with out the \"chain resturant\" feel.   Calzones, Pasta, pizza, salads, etc.  Great full menu, with lots of selection!  They also seem to have quite a variety of wine to choose from as well!!  I love it!  Now mind you, I only had a greek salad when I was here, so my experience with eating off the menu was limited, but it was tasty, none the less.  Its a great casual enviroment, and the resturant seems to be well kept and clean.  Warm, friendly staff members, with a lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have finally lived!  My boyfriend and i came here sometime last month.  It was the very first time I wanted pizza more than him. We had been looking at pictures online all morning! (I swear this man could live off pizza, So I definitely get my fill).  We went on lunch and the place was packed.  I was so excited about this place I actually teared up a little when we had to walk away with no pizza rolls. This time we made sure to order ahead and once we got there - there were actually seats so we stayed and ate.  The manager was a super friendly awesome guy.  Really enjoyable to talk to.  The food was amazing! I was so happy to have made it.  It seems the same people come there all the time and give me the feeling of being in a small town Mr. Deeds like pizza place.  Also.. I didnt have one but the size of the Calzones are ridiculous (HUGE!)!  I'm coming back for those!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here in Saturday night and it was packed. It was a 20 minute wait for two. We got a couple of drafts at the bar, which was full so we were standing by the bar...drafts were $4....My wife asked the man working behind the counter, who was taking care of to-go's if we were in the way because we were clearly standing by the service Area and to go counter because it was just that packed. He immediately said no and struck up a conversation and discovered that Jeff was one of the owners.My wife asked if they had wings , which they did not but he immediately suggested the pizza muffins and because it was our first time there hooked us up with a half dozen. This was totally unnecessary but very much appreciated. We were sat in our estimated time and our server introduced himself and seeing we already had an app and drinks asked if wanted another round of drinks and   walked us thru the rest of the menu. The Buffalo Chicken muffins were awesome and filling so we went with a medium 12\" pizza with sausage, pepperoni & mushrooms. The pizza was good ....better than all the chain stuff...Dominos etc...not Grimaldi's or Bianca's but not that price either...this is a great neighborhood place serving a good meal at a good price."}
{"text":"Just got delivered from uber eats, what a great value. I got the Greek salad and a small pizza for my son. Pizza was amazing and my salad was very fresh!  Try them out"}
{"text":"Service is great, waitress is fantastic.  Pizza muffins are a perfect idea, you could just have those and be happy but you would be missing out on a great pizza."}
{"text":"As some one who has been coming here for years, I can tell you the items on the menu are hit and miss. My family loves the baked spaghetti, pizzas, calzones, pizza muffins, and eggplant parm. I've had several of there other pasta dishes (eg: alfredo) and was not a fan. You just have to know what to order from there. The pizza and calzones are awesome!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  I ordered Chicken marsala with a side of spaghetti.  The cutlet was basically chicken fried chicken covered in marinara that tasted like it came from a can.  It was topped with a blob of mozzarella.  The spaghetti had the consistency of Chef Boyardee spaghetti.  I ordered a pretty standard beer but received only 3/4 of a pour because the bartender said they were out (at 5:30 pm?) with no apology or offer to try a different beer.  I know why people like this place: it has a convivial atmosphere and low prices. But enjoying the taste of the food?  I don't know."}
{"text":"Grew up just a few blocks away from this place and never went in.  Don't let the outside fool you!  Tasty, family-friendly pizza joint.  Seems to be a family running it.  Food was above average and the service was great.  Even the pretty picky stepdaughter enjoyed it!  We went for plain cheese because my New Yorker husband always has to start with a plain cheese \"pie.\"  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Driving into the packed parking lot, I knew I was in for a treat. And even though the place was jam-packed AND had some private party going on, everything was great.  Being new, I asked the server -- and my dining companion -- for a recommendation. First impressions count! I received the calzone, which was as massive as advertised. Then again, all calzones are pretty massive. Now, it's hard to screw up a calzone. These guys don't go for fancy. Good bread, normal ingredients and sauce on the side. It was delicious.   My dining companion ordered something strange called \"pizza muffins\", I think. Very odd. Very tasty.  I ate half my calzone and took it to go. My kid ate it the next day and wants to know where I got it. But he took my leftovers. So until he pays his own way, I just may hold that information from him."}
{"text":"I second bob r.'s assessment. This place is a super family restaurant - really casual atmosphere. Humongous Calzones, and of course the kids loved the pizzas. I recommend trying their 'White Pizzas' Dee-lish! One thing I really look for when going out is good service and Florindino's was superb, our server was friendly, happy and really took care of my kids - With service like this and good eats on top of that (and a fair selection of adult beverages) This is definitely going to be put on our 'regular' list."}
{"text":"This place has great food at reasonable prices so it is no wonder it is always busy. The white pizza is awesome but I like to get the calzones because I can have something different then the rest of the family and the price is reasonable. This time we tried the pizza muffins and they were great!  No shocker!"}
{"text":"I went here on high recommendation... I was told that I would want to move from Scottsdale to Chandler to be closer to this restaurant. Well... I am not moving. I did enjoy it though.  First off, I ranked this place a 3, but it's very nearly a 4. My only issue was the grease. Their food is greasy. It's tasty, but greasy. We ordered a small pizza, famous breadsticks with cheese, and baked spaghetti. The baked spaghetti was supposed to be the best thing I've ever eaten. It was good. The breadsticks were good - it would've been nice had we known the baked spaghetti came with breadsticks - we wouldn't have ordered a separate side.  The table was filled with mounds of bread and cheese. We ended up needing 2 or 3 to-go boxes. I had to soak up grease with napkins. The peperoni was flavorful though. The pizza was delicious. It wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was good.   Nothing was bad about this place - it's very much an authentic classic pizza joint. The place was clean (didn't check out the bathroom though) and smelled of pizza. The staff was nice (though they forgot the meat sauce we ordered with our pasta).   If you live in the area, it's a solid choice. If I lived nearby, it would be on rotation. I won't be going out of my way to eat here, but I will eat here again. Nearly a 4 star rating here. I only wish I didn't feel like I just ate a lump of fat and washed it down with a glass full of grease."}
{"text":"I ordered pepperoni pizza muffins & lasagna for carry-out around 7:45 on a Sunday evening.  The lasagna was just average to me...I didn't care for the sausage in it.  The pizza muffins were good.  I don't think they were as fresh as they could have been but that's probably because I made a carry-out order about an hour before closing on a Sunday night.  The customer service was great and parking was easy.  I may come back to try a different item off their menu."}
{"text":"They have great pizza rolls! There is definitely some good american Italian food here. Whenever I go to Italian places I always order Chicken Parm. There's was the worst I've ever had. It wasn't unbearable but the moment I took a bite I wish I ordered something else. Chicken tasted like it was the frozen kind that was just thrown in the microwave. Didn't taste crispy and fresh like I expected. But our service was good and everything else about our meal was decent. I will be back for a select few things such as decently priced pizza and the pizza rolls."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, just as we remember.  GET THE Deluxe CALZONE, perfect.  And split it with someone so you have room for a SICILIAN SUNDAE!!!  Great service on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"I went into eat dinner with my girlfriend I ordered my food with no tomatoes because I am extremely allergic.  And I made the aware of my allergies.  When I got my food it was covered with tomato sauce.  I sent it back by the time my girlfriend finished her food I still did not receive my food after waiting 30 minutes my food still was not ready so I tried to just pay for the food that had already been eaten and be on my way. That was not the case however. After asking to pay I was yelled at very loud by the owner. Who was mad I arrived at 8 when the store closes at 9. Then after screaming at me he charged me for my girlfriends food and the food I had not eaten.  Needless to say I wont be returning"}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free pizza and my husband really enjoyed his salami/olive pizza too. The small anti pasta did not disappoint. That thing was loaded! This might be my new go to gluten free pizza."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Love love pizza muffins and the cookie!!! Great service every single time!"}
{"text":"Tried their pizza muffin for the first time which was delicious.. My friend ordered the lunch calzone and drink for $6 and got more than her money's worth.. The waiter was nice and kept checking on us.."}
{"text":"My first choice for a \"way-homer\" pizza.  (That's a pizza I pick up on my way home from work.) Since Floridino's is in my neck of the woods, I will call ahead before I start my commute home, order my usual (double pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage), and swing by to pick up my pipin' fresh pie.  Have always been pleased with the quality of the pizza here, in particular, the crust. This pizza works best when slightly reheated in the microwave. The crust retains that perfect chew.  Judging from other Yelper's reviews, I should stop by and dine-in sometime. The pasta and the pizza muffins look worth the visit."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years without issue, but our last two visits we have received horrible service...  We went in on Christmas Eve Eve and after a few minutes wait got a table in the back. We sat there for 10 minutes without a server even acknowledging us... until I finally went up to the hostess stand to ask what was going on. It then took another 5 minutes to have someone come over and it didn't get much better from there. Our waitress was very nice but I've never heard a server apologize so much, not just to us but to the tables around us. She comped our dessert and we brushed it off as an isolated incident and her having a bad night...  But then we came in yesterday....and our server was even worse. Noah was rude and inattentive and I felt like he was mocking me when I asked for extra ranch dressing. (That he never even bothered to bring.) None of us received a drink refill the entire visit. And I asked for to-go lids for our ranch/marina and he never came back with those either. We had planned to order dessert but he set the check on the table and disappeared before we even had a chance to ask. Easily lands on my top 3 worst dining experiences in my lifetime...  I really hope this isn't the new norm for Floridino's."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my sister on Friday, Dec. 29, 2017 for lunch. They have awesome lunch specials. I had never been to this establishment before and after this experience I will definitely be back. The place was packed during lunch hour, but we were greeted & seated immediately by friendly staff. Our waiter was very attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu & prices. I had the calzone at the lunch special price but dinner sized portion. The food was fresh, flavorful and tasty. Amazing Italian comfort food. Upon completion of our meal, we were offered dessert, but had to pass due to being stuffed. Overall, great price for quality food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in my \"hood\" and I had heard good things about the pizza muffins so I had to give it a try.   It was busy on a Friday night but we only waiting about 10 mins for our table.  The servers were on top of things as far as I could see.  Our server was at out table in two seconds taking drink orders.  Since it was our first time there I wanted to look over the menu.  He gave us sufficient time and then he was back, took our order, and salad and breadsticks for my daughter arrived in about 5 mins.  The pizza muffins were right behind........ahhhh....these are like crack to me.  I'm instantly addicted!  Little wheels of pizza dough with chesse and ham, fresh and hot and gooey.  YUM!!!!  I should have just made a meal off the pizza muffins but I had to try the pizza.  My daughter had a Jr. Pizza with her favorite topping, black olives.  She gave it a big thumbs up. I tried one with sausage, salami and mushrooms.  The dough was soft, cooked to perfection and has a nice flavor.  The toppings were generous.  It was good and I took the rest home.    It seems as thought everyone there were regulars, locals.  The service was fast and friendly. I thought the prices were very resonable. When we were ready to leave my daughter needed a to go cup for the rest of her drink.  Our server kindly obliged and brought her a to go cup.....filled with more of her drink!  We will be back!  I'm sure I will be craving pizza muffins very soon!!"}
{"text":"Yummy, real Italian food, it's our go to place when we are visiting Arizona. Definitely a place everyone needs to try from the baked spaghetti, alfredo cheese ravioli, and the famous pizza muffins you'll leave full and happy, oh little tip grab a to go cup they are massive!"}
{"text":"The service at this location ROCKS! From the front door straight thru the kitchen. The venue is cute and quaint and offers a trellis vine covered patio that was largely unused at the early hour that I visited, (11:30am), though I could see myself and a few friends chatting it up while sipping bar favorites and eating pizza muffins, SOON.. The server told me that the establishment has been there for 13-years (+/-), so I know it's not new, however it is greatly under used. Can you say \"party of 10, 12, 13?\" I can. Easily. So yes, I'm making plans for this place as I speak. The service is good, the food is good and they have ample room. It's a recipe for a good time waiting to happen!"}
{"text":"Called GRUB HUB to deliver some good ol' authentic Italian food from Floridino's. I had a craving. Grub Hub was quick in the delivery but Floridino's let me down with the authenticity factor. I purchased the chicken Parmesan with spaghetti + 2 additional meatballs and it tasted like a frozen meal from the grocers freezer with authentic marinara sauce on top and mozzarella cheese. A frozen meal from the grocers freezer. The meal was only $10 on the menu plus the meatballs and delivery fee added up to a price too steep - when you're just craving authentic Ma & Pa Italian cuisine. I hate to say it, but I've had better at the commercial chain OLIVE GARDEN and they don't claim to be authentic at all."}
{"text":"We used to love floridinos but our visit today put a bad taste in our mouth. I wanted a light lunch so I chose a bowl of their Italian wedding soup. I was incredibly surprised when I was brought a bowl the size of a thimble. When I inquired if this was a bowl the server mumbled something and walked away quickly. The soup itself was nothing to write home about the little pearl noodles were basically mush. Everyone else's food in my party was up to par with their normal standards but I was put off by the size of my my meal. At the end we inquired again if this was really a bowl and the server got a little snippy and said \"yes! I'll show you a cup for the size!\" He proceeded to bring out an even smaller thimble and show us that indeed we had been given a \"bowl\". For comparison, the \"bowl\" I was given was the size of a normal soup cup that one would receive at a normal restaurant.  All in all everyone else's meal was delicious and of normal size but their soup size choices were extremely misleading and I would caution anyone to order their soup."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've reviewed Floridino's and I have been here a lot of times since my last review. Bottom line, they never have messed up my order. The food is always great and cooked/seasoned very well. The baked spaghetti is my favorite pasta dish. I always get either meatballs or a side of spicy Italian sausage with that order. The buffalo chicken pizza muffins with bacon are my favorite appetizer although you can't go wrong with the amazing original variety. Other favorites that are top notch and melt in your mouth good are: baked lasagna with a side of meatballs and/or sausage, fettuccine Alfredo, calzone, chicken Parmigiana, baked ziti and baked manicotti."}
{"text":"Pizza Muffins are awesome, but Pizza is more like Pappa Johns. I prefer an authentic NY Pizza with crispy crust."}
{"text":"Had lunch today 4/29/15 at floridino's and ordered large antipasto and a medium pizza with mushrooms and sausage. This place was a real find in Chandler Az. The antipasto salad was fresh and full of flavor. Very large portions and we had to take some home. The pizza was a surprise as well.... great sauce and delicious crust. The service was excellent and engaging. Friendly folks with plenty of room. To avoid the crowd a late afternoon lunch or early dinner is a perfect time. We will be regulars."}
{"text":"Excellent informal Italian.  Service great headed by Mike, the manager.  Everyone friendly.  Easy location.  Fast when on the go.  Lunch specials affordable especially with large families on budget."}
{"text":"This location is the worst. There was only one staff member there and he was an older gray haired man. I got his attention to send an order of muffins back because there was a hair in my food and he argued with me for 5 minutes trying to convince me it was a pice of cheese when it was very obvious it was a looooonnnggg black and gray hair. Service was very slow and un bussed tables everywhere. Also had to keep asking to get a refill of water.. Wont be back! I recommend the one in Chandler."}
{"text":"I am beside myself right now.  My server was incredible but cleary intimidated by the owner...in fact fearful of this rotten human. I have been a small business owner for decades..I get that their can be issues... Cockroaches dancing on my chicken, salad, bread and wine?  Is that cool with you?  Not with me, however, I understand it can happen in a food establishment. Owner came out after being requested of three times, I just wanted him to get the giant bug off my table as my purse was on table and I didn't want it to crawl in..Finally he comes out and.watches the flying sewer roach walk across all my food (i was sitting outside) after watching him for about 2 minutes...grabs the bug out of my wine, places him on his arm and says \"this bothers you?\" Allows the huge roach to climb all over him.  (DISGUSTING)  \" Why yes it does...my plan was to take my leftovers to work tomorrow.\"  He says \"And now, you are not going to take the leftovers?\"  \"No, that bug crawled all through my food.\" He let's the bug fly free in the wind with a brush of his hand and walks right back into the kitchen. server brings my bill and says the owner was nice enough take the meal off.  okay BRAVFRICKINO!!!!!!!!!!  but replaces it for a bill for the wine.  He told the server to tell me that I drank more of the wine than the roach did.  I told the adorable server who was so embarrassed, I was not going to pay the bill..She explained that she would be fired if I did not.  Just like she told me when I asked her originally to get the owner/manager when the bug was on my food.. I paid the bill and tipped her handsomely and told her she needs to find another job as she is very good at what she does.  My experience was horrible, but the way the server reacted was more than concerning...Kind of like how a battered woman would react. Btw...this occured two weeks ago...has taken me this long to make sense of what to write...stunning, and obviously this dude has a screw loose.  Andddd after posting this all over facebook and telling every single one of my clients, and will continue too...One of my clients/friends contacted the original Floridino's...The owner there was embarrassed for this man's actions and offered to make it right..Now that is customer service...These two businesses are not at all affiliated.  Do not go to this resturaunt...Many people left after witnessing his condescending nature..I was left furious for the evening...Try the Floridino's on Alma School...I've heard they are very very very good...and I already know the practice excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I highly recommend trying the pizza muffins (both the original and the pepperoni). Unfortunately, our experience was overshadowed by EXTREMELY poor service. And on the night we had out of town guests? We won't be back..."}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times now and it has always been a good experience. The pizza biscuits are a great starter and the service has always been great for us."}
{"text":"Came in during Valentine's Day had great service from all the employees food was exactly how I like it and done just on time even though it was a busy day. I'll definitely be back when I'm in the mood for great food!"}
{"text":"The pizza muffins and caesar salad were both really good! The pizza was pretty good, too, but nothing amazing IMO. My only complaint is that the service could have been better. It was okay, but I felt kind of ignored in favor of the regulars. When I left, none of the many employees standing around said bye or even smiled, which I found odd. So don't go here expecting to feel very welcome, but at least you'll get pretty good food! I'll probably be back at some point, but maybe I'll get it to go."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I would absolutely return.  The environment overall was OK. Nothing stood out but it was good enough to have a good eating experience.  The pepperoni roll/muffin/whatever appetizer was delicious. It was not quite as good as the similar offering from Old Chicago, but it was still great. They had great deals on beer, which they served in a mini-pitcher. Wasn't even happy hour and I felt like the price was great.  The table all enjoyed their food. I ended up ordering a pasta dish that was absolutely delicious. I would return again for that alone."}
{"text":"Now this is the real deal of a local pizza joint with flavor.  Another review stated the calzone is not completely filled with stuffing at each corner, that is still true..a lot of wasted space and I don't care to eat simply cooked dough.  I too most likely will refrain from this menu item, but all else, well you cant go wrong and for my military buddies they have a military discount.  I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Love this place - Pizza Muffins are the best....- updating my review 11-16-16 I have used their catering services many times - Just used them for my daughters wedding this past weekend.  Sarah and her staff were outstanding - they served Pizza Muffins for cocktail hour - received rave reviews for them - buffet line food was outstanding - they provided table service clean up efficiently and politely. I received feedback from many, many attendees telling me how great the food and service was. Thank you Sarah and the Floridino's team for helping make it a great night!"}
{"text":"Popped in the other day.  My wife ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and I got me a chicken caesar salad.  Where to begin?  Lets start with portion size.  We weren't looking for some hefty size portion, but if this was for a grown man, they would have laughed and said thanks for the sampler.  The meatballs were pretty small too, and probably came from a restaurant supply house.  The sauce tasted exactly like they opened up a can of crushed tomatoes and heated it up.  Very bland, no flavor or visible herbs/seasonings.  I'm not a gambler, but I would bet this was a purchased sauce... and being a family owned business, this was quite unexpected.  My salad came out quick... too quick.  My chicken wasn't hot.  It had been sitting around a while.  That made a big difference in taste.  In my opinion, Floridino's has a great chicken caesar salad... BUT only if you get fresh chicken.  Specifically ASK for fresh and hot chicken!  I will.  As we walked out, I noticed a boxing gym in the same strip mall area.  I gots ta check that out."}
{"text":"Great service! terrible food, a shame.  The Ceasar salad had the wrong type of lettuce, wrong dressing. Came with tomatos!  Lasagna bland and mushy!  And why. The Tv??!"}
{"text":"First let me say, thank you for the friendly staff and managers . You guys were awesome. The food is awesome. Especially the cheesy bread sticks! Everything was great overall ."}
{"text":"We have driven by here numerous times and always see a somewhat FULL Parking lot,, We decided to try this place out..   Figured 1. Get pizza, if they can do pizza right,, we come back.. Wife got Egg Plant Parmigiana..   Service Excellent, Wait time for food, Great, not too quick, but not too long.  The Food: Pizza was fresh, and the bottom had a light Crunch which i like.. I often put pizza on a frying pan to get that crunch with left overs.. Not the best pizza by far, but in the top 5 i would say for Chandler..  Egg Plant Parmigiana, Wife loved it, and has ideas on making her own version... Egg Plant isn't really one of my choice plates, so i wont say yay or nay..  Prices were a little high, close to what you would pay at Olive Garden, Red Lobster (not that i go there), or similar places.. for the variety, i will come back, but if i just want pizza, the budget will decide, and for these prices, i will easily go to NELLO's instead..  Great restaurant,... I would recommend but be specific on the expectations."}
{"text":"Always great food. Unique offerings w their pizza rolls and calzones. Their baked dishes are sometimes large enough to share.  The one thing we aren't fond of is their garlic bread. It looks like pizza dough flattened out and baked but it's so flippin' dry and lacking of garlic and butter that they try to put in it. They need to make something better. I know they can because of their pizza rolls and other doughy offerings.  Overall it is a great neighborhood eatery that has awesome food , quick service and a Mom and Pop feel. Come as you are!!"}
{"text":"Comfort food at some of its best. Portions are huge for the price you're paying, and the calzones are absolutely monstrous. If you can actually eat a whole calzone by yourself, you're a hungrier man than I.  There isn't a whole lot of seating, so consider takeout if you're in a hurry to eat or need to feed a particularly large group."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got the special to go the other night. The wait was reasonable especially because the dining room was pretty full. The special came with a tossed salad that I was slightly dissapointed with because it was just a box of iceburg lettuce with what resembled tomatoes cubes,  but its ok I came for the pizza.  The special also included cheesy bread sticks which weren't bad, but nothing to write home about and the sauce that came on the side was meh. But that's ok because I came for the pizza... Now the pizza was surprisingly tastey. Awesome thin crust and the toppings were plentiful. I would definitely come back for the pizza but probably leave out the extras. Side note.... I was pretty disappointed they didn't have wings, probably take away a star for that."}
{"text":"We eat lunch here at least once a week. This place is always crazy busy and that's because everything is delish! Take a friend and split a deluxe calzone and a spicy chicken salad. Everyone raves about pizza muffins and they are great too. I don't know anyone who has had anything they didn't like. Prices are really reasonable too."}
{"text":"Great family pizza joint.  Liked the ambiance, fun and welcoming.  Had lunch...Food was above average.  Will definitely come back for dinner some time."}
{"text":"Two words: huge calzones. Okay one more word: cheap! This place is good quality neighborhood Italian food.  I have heard the lunch specials are great too. I did try the pizza rolls - they're awesome but definitely not the healthiest.  Its been busy every time I've stopped in to pick up my order. Have never dined in. According to other reviews the bar is friendly."}
{"text":"Very good little Italian place!  We are from out of town and this was a nice little gem. The pizza muffins are awesome. Just order 12 instead of doing 6 and then getting 6 more like we did!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been a couple times now and we always leave wanting to come back sooner rather than later. The pizza muffins are as good as advertised, you'll be tempted to order 6, but 12 is the better option, always. We really enjoy the atmosphere, which is friendly and feels like a family run, welcome to our home feeling. We brought our 7 month daughter and staff seemed happy to accommodate our needs. I went with the chicken Parmesan sandwich which was tasty, the bun was light and crispy. Hopefully we don't forget to visit again before too much time passes."}
{"text":"First time here to benefit Wildhorse Horse Ranch!  Great food and service. You have to try the \"muffins\"!"}
{"text":"Giving it a 4 stars cuz I fell in love with the pizza muffins.  Yeah I said it  I love these things that remind me of a really good cinnamon roll  only made with pizza dough and toppings.  Yummy..    Our waiter was very nice and our food was delivered in a timely manner.  The salads looked good, didn't order one and it's a good thing.  I was stuffed after eating half of my calzone.  Yeah they are pretty big.    Hubby got the ziti with meatball and he really liked it.  Better then our other favorite place that's just up the street from here.    My calzone had a lot of mozzarella cheese but very little ricotta but the fresh tomato and spinach made up for that.  The red sauce wasn't the most spectacular I ever eaten.  Next time I might try it inside my calzone and see how I like."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! Our server, Angie, was also such a treat!! The food was  so reasonably priced and I will definitely come here again!!"}
{"text":"It is one of my favourite pizza places. I like their white calzone. One of my many Saturday rituals. They get really busy sometimes due to special offers for seniors and other such occasions."}
{"text":"Good food- okay service ( depending on server)- great portions ( except lunch menu).   I have introduced some friends to this little eatery and they have all loved the :  -pizza muffins -calzones -lasagna  those are definitely the best as the other dishes are just okay. All in all- for the reasonable prices and great tasting italtion foods...it worth the calories and the savory bites!"}
{"text":"Great place .  Our favorite Italian restaurant since moving to Chandler in 2002.  GREAT service, wonderful food, huge portions - everything's good - especially after they expanded their floor space."}
{"text":"I usually get the food here takeout, and have only eaten in once.  The pizza is very good, and better than what you'd get form a delivery place.  The calzones are gigantic, and well worth the calories. The white pizza is one of my favorites, but don't sleep on the red sauce pies either. The pepperoni is great, tho every once in a while it has a bit too much sauce."}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch. It was decent. The lunch was affordable and the staff was friendly. I had the lunch calzone special. It tasted ok, but I got very little filling. I had ground beef and onions, but the majority of it was just a cheese filled bread pocket. I should definitely come back and try something else, but I was a little underwhelmed by the calzone."}
{"text":"Ok...so we all know (or at least I do...) that the Floridino's on Alma School is really really good. Not only is it good, but it's cheap!    The BF and I decided to try the new location and to our surprise it is not really the same restaurant. I think it has different owners (?), the menu is different, the prices are higher, the food is not as good, and the service is lacking to say the least. I was SO disappointed. The restaurant itself is a lot colder feeling than the original, with weird lighting and is strangely quiet (the place wasn't empty, but it didn't have that bustling with business feel or sounds like the original has). Our waitress did not smile and seemed genuinely angry when we needed a minute to decide on food and when we told her we were sharing. Not real cool. We shared a salad, breadsticks, and a calzone. The salad was fine (but the dressing tasted slightly off from the other restaurant), the breadsticks are totally different....like thicker and hard.... the calzone was bigger, but the dough used was not as tasty as the dough at the original location. I still gave the place 3 stars because the food was decent, but, needless to say, I would never choose this location over the original.    PS: The BF asked me if it was fair to compare this location to the original (because, honestly, if there was not an original and better version I probably would have given this place a 4) BUT I do think it's fair because even if it is different owners, they are using the same name and so, in my opinion, they should have consistency in their menu, prices, and service..... Just sayin....."}
{"text":"The BF and I went here tonight and it was AWESOME!!! This place is a cute little family restaurant that has comforting food for extremely inexpensive. We shared an individual salad, which was fresh and had an abundance of cucumbers and tomatoes...also, the house italian dressing was very tasty. We got an order of breadsticks, which were good, nothing wonderful, but something I would get again. Then we shared a calzone with pepperoni and ricotta cheese that was very good. The calzone crust was golden and delicious and the sauce was also very good. But you wanna know the best part? Our very filling dinner cost 12$. That's right. 12$. That is crazy ridiculous! We will definitely be back here... this may be our new go to pizza place, so hooray for that!"}
{"text":"Our family absolutely loves this place! Their food is so good, and their prices are amazing. If you go, you've got to try the pizza muffins, the pazzo salad bowls, and the butternut squash ravioli is amazing. When I'm there I also buy a big tub of their ranch dressing that they make there, it's so yummy."}
{"text":"Good Italian.   great fresh pizza sauce and dough! me and the wife order the sauce and the dough by itself on occasion cause it's so good and only 3 bucks! then we add our favorite quality ingredients. we love it here, and visit occasionally.  The good things that Floridinos does is that they have some good fresh food: bread, pizza, sauces, pasta  Some not so fresh things we stay away from seems to be the chicken in any form, it tastes good, it's edible, just not fresh. Have not tried it all the food but you'll figure out your likings if you go here regularly. You notice that a lot of things are just heated up in the oven when ordered making food a bit soggy and pasta a bit dry and crunchy  The customer service here is awesome! Smart people, nice, quick, you name it. Service is great.  To go orders ate great here to. I love getting orders to go all the time"}
{"text":"Had another Great Quick meal here. The calazone with mushrooms' olives & ricotta Cheese. Delicious! As luck would have it they were also televising the EPL Arsenal Vs. Tottenham Hotspur match. I lingered here alittle while longer to watch. While enjoying the game, I had a few good blonde ales from a great local brewery and really enjoyed my calazone. This is a nice little local place to eat great food on the go and enjoy a few surprises as well. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Cody the waiter is worth the price of admission.  He was so different from last night's waiter (at the Blue Adobe) it was ridiculous.  He's got a very good attitude and a cheerful, funny patter.  I'd ask for him.  The Pizza muffin was very good, the meatball sub outstanding, and that sundae with the brownie was obscene.  Bread pudding pretty dang good if you like that kind of thing. You don't need all of the things you think you need, but you won't regret it.  Got right in and the place cleared out at 7:30pm on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Service was great all around. Drinks and food were pretty low in price. But the food was bland / just okay - we had the butternut squash ravioli and chicken parmesan. The \"spicy\" pink sauce that was on the ravioli was not spicy at all, it just tasted like alfredo with maybe a little marinara sauce mixed in. The marinara on the chicken parm and accompanying ziti was just plain marinara, practically flavorless.  The original pizza muffins were, however, very tasty.   I can see the appeal for large families looking to take their family out for dinner without breaking the bank. But if I have absolutely no desire to eat leftovers, I'm not likely to return."}
{"text":"Excellent Sr Citizen deal on mondays after 3!! Get there early, but worth the wait. Staff is always pleasant and friendly. We come at least twice a month and have never had a bad or even so-so meal. Their monthly specials are worth trying...yum!! The baked spaghetti is excellent"}
{"text":"Q: How did the hipster burn his mouth? A: He took a bite of his pizza before it was cool!  Yeah, I went there.  I also went to Floridino's which has been around since 1996!  And once you walk inside, the carpet squares, the dark green lighting sconces and wall paint, and the dim lighting will prove that clearly.  It's a bit dated but it's quaint!  Business had a constant steady flow, every table was taken, and the staff was fast and efficient.  So since it was our first time going even though my homie Linh L. has been harassing me to go, I wanted to try a little bit of everything.  Here's what we got:  * ORIGINAL STYLE MUFFINS [Stuffed with ham, ground beef, Italian sausage and fresh mozzarella cheese], 1/2 Dozen for $4.99: - Yum!  That fatty sausage made each bite so decadent and juicy and I love that mozzarella cheese.  Te ham and ground beef just makes every bite all the more flavorful.  * PEPPERONI MUFFINS, 1/2 Dozen for $4.99: - When is pepperoni ever a bad thing?  Get these.  I think I might even like them more than the Original Style Muffins.  Then again, I am a pizza fiend.  * BUTTERNUT SQUASH RAVIOLI [Half moon shaped pasta filled with a fresh blend of roasted butternut squash, ricotta and Parmesan cheese. Tossed in our Spicy \"Pink\" sauce], $12.59: - Holy moley, that's a lot of sauce!  As soon as the waitress set the plate down, a waterfall of spicy pink sauce splashed onto the table.  All good.  I was a bit curious though as to why I got square ravioli instead of moon shaped ones but no biggie.  I still ate every single one of those butternut squash filled pillows.  It was deliciously sweet!  I also enjoyed the slight heat from the dish.  Spicy sweet?  Yes please!  Presentation isn't cute but oh well.  * SPECIAL CALZONE [Pepperoni, ham, onion, green pepper and mushroom], $10.49: - I didn't even get around to trying this.  The onion looked raw though so I was a bit put off by that but it was a generous portion and smelled amazing.  All in all, I'd definitely come back to Floridino's for their delicious muffins.  I want to try all the flavors!"}
{"text":"So we went to Floridino's because I read somewhere that they were rated the best Italian restaurant in Chandler.  I try not to expect too much when I go to a restaurant like this because it is subjective.  My wife and I went for date night.  We ordered a lot for 2 people with intentions of taking some home for leftovers for the week.    I have to say that Floridino's isn't over hyped.  The food was excellent and the service was better.  They had a floater that seemed his only job was to get people refills on their drinks, this is a nice touch!    If you are thinking about going, don't be a dope like I was and put it off.  Reward yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is packed every night! Get there early and hope you can get a seat because you'll be in for a treat!  One of the best pizza's i've ever had in my life.  The flavor and taste of the bread was amazing.  Their sauces were very good along with their toppings.  Looking forward to coming back and trying more of their dishes.  K"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME Great prices plus the pizza muffins are to dine for!  I have been coming here for years.  Expect a wait if you come on weekends since the place does get packed!"}
{"text":"You cannot find a calzone like theirs anywhere! Trust me, I've tried. I live in California now and often crave this place and can't have it. So I settle on other place and it turns out... I do not like calzones unless it's from floridinos. So now I just go when I visit chandler. Would love if some of my friends could ship me one!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Floridino's. The pizza is always on point and a calzone will change your life! They are always super friendly. You can tell a lot of love goes into everything. We order from there nearly every weekend. Especially during football season."}
{"text":"you cannot beat Floridino's for value for the dollar.  Awesome food and great service."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Floridino's Gilbert for many years. The food is excellent and the  service great. The pizza crust is soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Dema the owner is charming and inviting to everyone. I came here at least 1 per week when my daughter was younger because the kids love it and the prices for kids pizza is great. Love his pizza and place."}
{"text":"First and last time I'll go to flordinos. I'm not sure how this place has 4 stars unless they are fake reviews. I ordered a large pizza half pepperoni half pineapple and a order if the \"famous bread sticks\". First, the order was messed up and they put pepperoni on the whole pizza, which I can get past, mistakes happen. However, the food quality was absolute garbage. The pizza tasted like gas station pizza, and im not  talking about the good QT pizza. I'm talking about pizza at AMPM that has been sitting under the heat light for three days. The famous bread sticks we're bland and didn't have a whole lot of flavor. Overall just disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent. Service was great and fast on a busy Friday night. Zesty bread sticks, calzones, pizza...all very good"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this restaurant but after reading the reviews it sounds like the other location is the place to be.   I went to this location with some co-workers at lunch time. There wasn't much business, so we thought it should fairly easy. The server messed up our food, bringing the wrong dish out to someone, and I became suspicious when the chicken parm was ready only minutes later after taking it back to the kitchen. I had ordered the lobster ravioli and found that whatever they stuffed the ravioli with was not good lobster, or was mixed with something that did not compliment the lobster. The inside was very spongy and I suspect these were actually frozen ravioli's instead of fresh made. The ravioli's themselves were also overcooked and mushy and drowning in a plate of sauce. I was also not expecting to pay $17.99 for lobster ravioli, not to mention my bill came to over $20 with my iced tea. I will say out cheesy garlic bread that comes with the meal was good.   I would probably not come back to this location however, I would be willing to try the location in Chandler."}
{"text":"I was there thus at 1215 no one there sign said lunch special 7.99 food was bad then waitress charged 8.99 for special she couldn't figure out why cook came out he couldn't figure it out  after 15 mins I left 20.00 and said I have to go the bill should have been 1.00 they have clue whoever the waitress is is bad the meatball sandwich is better at subway and the pasta was terrible this place is not Italian I will never go back.  sorry but anyone who thinks this is Italian doesn't know Italian"}
{"text":"Great family Italian joint. We got really great service and I was really impressed with the level of food. I had the chicken and we also had a spaghetti and meat balls at the table and a pizza. They do get really crowded and there is often a line to get in. Best to make sure you plan an extra 20 to 30 minutes of wait time when you get there."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, good service, at a great price.  Highly recommend eating here.  Only thing--they don't seem to take reservations, so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"I forgive their crowdedness always because it's so good.   Last night my child's school had a fundraiser there (read: damn good excuse to go back) and since it's less than a mile from her school, we rocked it after I picked her up. Pizza muffins are always the thing ordered no matter the group, and I love that they have at least one local San Tan Brewery beer on tap mostly always, and it was only $2 a pint!   When I go, I always get the Calzone. The two item calzone is how I roll and I am a traditional ricotta kinda guy; they sure do load it up, so I always order that. If we have 2+ people we like to also get the antipasto salad, which is always made fresh and tasty with ingredients that seem to be picked daily.   Tonight my daughter had the ravioli from the full children's menu and her mother said it was quite tasty, too. Unless you have a large party for the party room, there's usually a well worth it wait, but last night we noticed they're remodeling so I bet they're adding more seating through a previously sealed off area. Go team!"}
{"text":"I came in for a rehearsal dinner and I loved the party set up, it was away from the other restaurant goers so it felt intimate (even a private bathroom!) The real star of the meal was the pizza muffins. I could live off the things. Super good!"}
{"text":"Love this place - after visiting England, my sister and I come in here and, despite the Italian food, see this place like we do a good English pub. (Pubs are not necessarily bars, like they world be here in the US). We come here and love it - all the food is fresh, real, and light - nothing here is heavy or fake tasting. I love their calzones because the the bread is so  light and fluffy! Mmm. Also, their fettuccini alfredo is amazing!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were warmly welcomed by our server and every aspect was great until I ordered a cocktail. The cocktail was supposed to contain 2 Oz of white rum and 1 Oz of hpnotiq with sprite as a mixer. Served in an 8 Oz glass, I literally  couldn't taste the liquor and there was maybe 1/4 Oz of hpnotiq. No big deal, I let the server know that the drink was incorrectly made, she offered a new drink but I decided against it. When the check was dropped I noticed the $7 drink charge was not taken off. I work in the industry, I very rarely make a complaint but I let her know that I felt I shouldn't be charged for the cocktail. A few moments later I am aggressively approached by a man who was apparently the owner. Before I could even get a word in he began to go on a rant about how wrong I was, how he ran the place flawlessly, and eventually started raising his voice towards me. I was so thrown off about how aggressive, egotistical and arrogant that this so called owner was that I could hardly respond. After arguing with him (I maintained a professional tone and polite word choice) this guy just gets more and more aggressive. He eventually only gave me half off my drink that he horribly poured with his own two hands that are apparently incapable of making mistakes. Absolutely the most unprofessional, unpleasant, arrogant owner/manager I have ever encountered. The food was good, our service was flawless. We'll never be back because of this man, who by the way never introduced himself.  P.S. the owner had no idea what white rum was. Yep, the same owner who apparently knows how to make a flawless cocktail. This guy pulled out a bottle of Malibu because it's rum with a white label, I stopped him and pointed out the correct bottle. What a joke."}
{"text":"Crust is delicious.  Not thin but not think, right amount of sauce, cheese and toppings. The original pizza muffins are addicting.  I have had a couple of pasta dishes, and they are good.  But I drive the 15 miles for the pizza, muffins and a fair price."}
