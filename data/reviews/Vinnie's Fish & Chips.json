{"text":"I took one star off because the amount of fish & chips with coleslaw varied with who the cook is.  Avoid going on Friday's for lunch because the owner Dino is there.  He is stingy on the special.

Go when he isn't there.  The lady who works full time gives alot more than Dino.  Get the special halibut fish & chips which comes with coleslaw and a free regular bottled or canned drink.

Avoid going when school is active.  The high school kids from across Weston Road fill the place at noon.

Oh, don't forget to tip the female cook.  She will remember you and give you extra on your second visit."}
{"text":"Eeek!  Okay, fish & chips from lots of different places...his by far the worst.  Thinnest piece of fish ever and wasn't a fan of the fries.  Honestly when my husband brought the bag of the two halibut meals in the car, the windows had to go down.  I couldn't taste the fish because of the dirty grease."}
{"text":"Considering this is Shops at Vellore where every Student comes to this nearby Plaza for their Lunch Break, I wasn't looking for anything the likes of Heston Blumenthal's Perfect Fish & Chips.  As you know High School Students are willing to eat anything that fits in their mouth.  At least when I was a High School Student but then I guess that fact hasn't changed much in my Adulthood.

Vinnie's does do Student Special's as with most other Restaurants of this Plaza and Students are whom I saw when I arrived indoors.  It was a breath of fresh air as the interior design has a modern touch rather than the traditional pub setting.  I felt quite comfortable waiting for my Lunch here while watching the LCD.  The Cook/Server here took my order and when it was being prepared, he provided the Cutlery while wiping down the dirty tables.   3.5 *Star*

Halibut & Chips w/Coleslaw & Pop/Water(Opening Special $11.25)  -  Crisp light seasoned(Salt) Batter made it delicious without the need for Tartar Sauce(Packaged).  The Halibut was A-Okay while the Chips were Crisp seasoned(Salt) outside and soft on the inside.  

This was a Lunch Special although I arrived way after the usual assigned time period.  That deal is best because it was only $1.00 additional to the Halibut & Chips only while giving you the Coleslaw & Pop/Water.  I'll probably give the Clam Chowder($2.95) a try next time while deciding on either Burgers, Wings or Salads.
