{"text":"Good Chinese takeout. Some dishes can be hit or miss- I've enjoyed most of what we have tried. Sesame chicken is always a family favorite, and I wish they had cold sesame noodles (Singapore noodles are a fair substitute).  Great place to order a [very] filling family meal. Since choices are limited in this area, it's tough to beat Hunan Chester!"}
{"text":"I eat here more frequently than any other place.  Mae will get her hubby to make the food as spicy as I want.  The major problem is they don't have two of my favorite dishes. Chinese Eggplant, and Wor Dip Har (butterfly shrimp).  Everything they do have is better than almost anywhere else. Beef dishes are always tender, and shrimp dishes have good sized shrimp and enough of them. I heartily recommend Hunan Chester."}
{"text":"I went to visit my friends in OH.  My friends recommended Hunan Chester b/c the owner May is well known in this community.  She had this place for like 20 years and knows the customers by it's dish.   I went in there with a few of my friends and we had the crab ragoon, general tso's chicken, (can't decide over governor's chicken or general tso's  chicken\" and beef lo mein.  It was all delicious!  The services was excellent!  We met May, a friendly, happy spirited person!  You can tell she LOVES her job!  She tended to us to make sure everything was good.  I am glad we came here and I will recommend this place if you are in the area!  It's a great casual place at a good price."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location multiple of times, over the ten years I have been in this location. That being said more than half of the time I've had to have my order corrected either because they forgot something or the ordered portion size was incorrect. The food is good which is why we keep coming back but I honestly can't remember a time there was not a slight issue."}
{"text":"Decent chinese takeout. Nothing that will make you jump up and down but its still good. Like most places some items are better than others.  general Chicken is pretty good but I have had MUCH better, and I have had worse. Crab Rangoon is really good actually.  Over all there are no real options in Chesterland and Hunan Chester is worth the takeout. Dining room is too open, and old looking. Not a great atmosphere for dine in.... But hey who does dine in at not gormet' - ish Chinese?"}
{"text":"Beware! After eating here 12/16/16 on 12/17/16 I developed severe (8 out of 10 on the pain scale) stomach cramping, diarrhea, and vomiting. I had the wonton soup and the fried dumplings. I missed work.  No other person in my party had the dumplings or wonton soup.  One person from my party had diarrhea, but none of the pain that I am having.  I will be contacting a lawyer as I missed work."}
{"text":"The dining room is less than spectacular looking, but is okay. The food is awesome, you get huge portions for a great price. My brothers swear by the orange beef and the general tso's chicken. The crab Rangoon are delicious too. I always come here when I'm feeling Chinese."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service!!! We were there tonight and there were less than 20 people in the restaurant, so it wasn't too busy. Our waitress brought out 1 of 4 things my husband had ordered and said she'd be right back. After 15 minutes we flagged her down and asked if the rest of his order was coming. She said yes, and walked away. After that she ignored us and avoided us at all cost!! I was finally able to get her attention  after 20 more minutes and asked if his order was ever coming. She looked like a deer in the headlights and didn't have any response. I asked if she could take it off the bill.  She NEVER once apologized for not bringing out 75% of an order!! Acted like it was no big deal at all. We will NEVER go back there again! It was dirty and the staff was not helpful. When the cashier found out what happened, she told us they didn't even have one of the things my husband had ordered and our waitress was supposed to have told us that. Highly disappointed in this restaurant! Won't EVER be back!"}
{"text":"Got take out and was about 5 mins down the street. Got home,Food was cold and the meat was very fatty. Didn't eat much of it but what I ate was enough to give me the worst stomach pains and nausea I've ever had. I don't recommend this place at all. I'm surprised they haven't been shut down yet. I don't think the sweet/sour pork was actually pork."}
