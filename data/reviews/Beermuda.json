{"text":"Hard to beat the selection of beers!  Pretty amazing place with an awesome variety and great prices.  The food is great as well.  Service can be a tad slow around lunch time, but otherwise no complaints.  Everything is baked rather than fried so that you can make up for having a few beers.  The staff seems to know their beers as well.  Hard to complain!"}
{"text":"Being new to the Pittsburgh area, my husband and I have been hunting for good spots to pick up craft beers and a good hang out as well. We tried Beermuda this weekend, and it's a great spot! The draft beer selection was good and the steak and sausage hoagie was to die for! The prices were excellent--for food and drink. We met some nice people sitting at the bar and the staff was great as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here can be great, but is not consistently good. The service, however, is awful. Calling in for pickup takes 5 minutes of calling and letting the phone ring. The bartenders and wait staff are slow and rude. If the entire staff was replaced, I would eat here."}
{"text":"First time there, even though lived in the area for many years, ordered the mushroom swiss burger and pizza, was excellent.  It took a little longer then expected to get the food, but worth the wait. Service staff was upbeat and friendly, which made the wait little better"}
{"text":"I didn't even want to give one star for this review. The service was horrible. Friends of ours told us to try this place because they have an amazing selection beer selection and very good food. We got there and wanted to sit outside and the server said there wasn't any seats in the one section but we could sit up at the upper deck. We took our seats and there was a table of 8 sitting there. We sat for 15 minutes until we were approached. The waitress said \"I told her to get you menus, she didn't?\" We waited another 5 minutes until we got menus for beer and food. It was a good 20 minutes at this point and we left. As we were leaving the parking lot the server was walking back. We also got a very negative feedback from a comment we left on other social media from someone who works there. The blame was on the servers and a very weak apology. I will not return."}
{"text":"If you love microbrews, this is the place.  It is definitely worth the ride to New Kensington. The selection of beers is mind blowing.  The food is really good.  Try the Sicilian hoagie on Syrian bread.  Many taps and bottles to take home.  The best part is the friendliness and knowledge of the bartenders. Casual,  huge outdoor deck. Upstairs and downstairs bars.  Great place to spend some time."}
{"text":"Trying to get served here if your not a regular will have you leaving more sober than when you arrived. Full service bar with at least two bar tenders that seem to only accommodate the regulars or those who are willing to smash themselves into the bleak opening of opportunity also know as an empty bar space. I hate going here if your not a regular the moment you walk in everyone stares at you and if your remotely attractive expect to be nearly mauled by drunks or shot dirty looks from every female in sight lol. Drinks are pretty over priced and and never even bothered attempting the food even though they do have a cool deck outside where they sometimes have some bands. I'm sure if I devoted myself to becoming a steady alcoholic I'd learn to love this place but as of now I haven't spent more then 30 minutes of my night entertaining the idea."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend, and a friend mentioned this place for dinner, since we both have never been. Beer menu was pretty good. That is why I am giving 2 stars. The place looks like they use it for storage. Tables, chairs, buckets, and decorations are stacked everywhere. I ordered the fish tacos. It was listed that the tacos had Mahi Mahi, cabbage slaw, and a wasabi sauce. My tacos came with a big chunk of fish and then coleslaw(the same coleslaw I ordered as a side). No wasabi sauce or spice at all. After dinner we stayed for a few drinks. The waitress stopped asking if we needed anything else and kept asking if we were staying or leaving. At one point she stopped walking over to our table and would peak her head out to ask."}
{"text":"When I first walked into the place, I was kid of taken aback.  Not what I was expecting judging from the reviews I read.  Proof positive that looks can be deceiving!!  The staff was prompt, friendly, and courteous.  The beer list was impressive and fun to read.  The food was very very good.  Their pizza and wings were phenomenal and the subs were about the size of a freaking real sub.  Definitely a 2 mealer.  I will most certainly be going back!!"}
{"text":"The the place was pretty good great selection of beer great selection of food. The only thing is you cannot get fries with a sandwich they everything is ala carte. The fish sandwich and hamburgers are the best sandwiches there.. the prices are reasonable but go early on a Friday don't order food late because service isn't that great at night"}
{"text":"The service is just plain awful, waited 25 minutes to get a menu, and never saw a server again before we left after sitting for 35+ minutes... I've been here a bunch of times, the food and beer are very good but the service has a way of making you irritated."}
{"text":"I can't speak of the food in this place or the upstairs \"restaurant\" section because I didn't see either. I went here in search of Southern Tier's Creme Brûlée Stout and they had it at a reasonable price. I found it amongst Beermuda's huge selection of excellent beers located in the basement bottle shop. This is where the good news ends.  Perusing the coolers and shelves downstairs was close to impossible because of the tables that are jammed into this section. I went during a Pens game; so I was expecting it to be busy, but the setup here is incredibly poor. I found my beer in the back section of shelves, but was starred at by patrons and felt very uncomfortable since I was practically standing at their table while they were conversing. Once I made my selection I maneuvered carefully again between tables and regulars to the bar where I was waited on by the most unsociable person to ever work behind a bar. He played with my selection and examined it as if he'd never seen a bottle before and then rung it up on the computer. He gave me my total and I handed him my card. He laid my card down, took his cell phone out of his pocket to answer a text or something, and then swiped my card. He handed me back my card with the receipt to sign and then asked me if I wanted a bag. I only include this detail because I was genuinely surprised he asked since he'd said almost nothing else to this point. The basement feels more like someone's man cave and less like a great bottle shop.  This spot has endless potential and from what I've heard the food is above average, but some of the other more negative things seem to be true as well. I probably won't go out of my way to patronize this place again."}
{"text":"This is the third time I have come to Beermuda. The first time I came I was there right as the kitchen opened and the food was amazing and prompt. I then returned with a friend to show them how good the food, service, and beer was and it was a trip from hell. The burger was not edible. First it took for EVER to get a waitress then it took an eternity for the burgers to get out. When they did they were so burned I felt embarrassed for the waitress that carried it out. The bacon was raw. They did however cook new burgers and it was good. It took over an hour and a half to finally eat and we were the only ones in there. NOW... I return again for a third time and once again waitresses everywhere and NOT one of them come to help us. Finally after I walk up to the empty bar and ask the bar tender if it would be possible to get service she said she will take care of us. She brings the menu over and asks what we want for drinks. NO BEER MENU. Really!!! There are so many beers. BRING THE FREAKIN LIST !!! We ordered the beer and food. Again the food is WAY over cooked but tasty. If it wasn't for the beer selection this place would never stay in business. Such a shame. The owner HAS to hire people who gives a shit. HORRIBLE SERVICE"}
{"text":"If this place wasn't so close to my house I would probably have never tried this place as many times as I have. They have an extensive beer list, but they are always out of about 3/4 of the list. Service is extremely slow and unfriendly. Food is subpar and the only redemption is the good bread for the sandwiches which is from the bakery across the street. Save your time and money and go to house of 1000 beers if you want a good variety of beers."}
{"text":"Great staff and food. Please help the toy drive for kids. Stop in and check out the list. Grab a bite and a large beer selection."}
{"text":"Very very poor service. Sat outside... took forever to get waited on, when we finally did get waited on we asked for a selection list and it took another 10 minutes. Eventually went inside and got the drinks that also took forever. The bar tender didn't even know if they had grenadine or disaronno."}
{"text":"I get take out from here often.  Their food used to be fantastic...now not so much.  99% of the time my order is missing something.  Either someone isn't paying attention or just doesn't care.  The put the crispy food (fries, cheese sticks,etc) in a styrofoam container trapping the steam so it's soggy when you get home.  Tried telling them...yeah they don't care.  This COULD be a fantastic place."}
{"text":"I stopped by Beermuda a couple Saturdays ago for a quick bite before heading to the movies.  I had been here one other time, remembered their nice beer selections, and that is what brought me back for more.  Beer:  Many different types and varieties of micro brews on tap and in bottles.  You can get lost in the variety -- which is a good thing.  Being hot that day, I stuck with the summer beer selections and loved everything that I had.  Food:  We ordered the nachos with pulled pork and an order of wings.  The nachos came on a pizza tray, and it was full of enough chips and toppings to cover it all.  I love having nachos where you can't find a dry chip on the plate and adding the pulled pork to it just topped it off.  The wings were a little small but cooked perfectly.  We has two side sauces of Sriracha Garlic and Spicy Ginger and both were very not very spicy (as advertised) but both tasted good.   Service:  The service category is where Beermuda falls apart.  I would hope it was just an off day, but the bar was not very busy and everything took forever.  It seemed like the one bartender was doing 90% of the work.  To add the cherry to the top of the terrible service sundae, it took an over an hour to get our bill worked out.  We got the wrong bill, followed by another wrong bill, and then when we attempted to use the Yelp deal, they messed it up again.  We wanted to get go to the 9:30 movie and barely made the 10:30.     Pros:  Food was decent and the beer selection is great.    Cons:  Service needs a bunch of work.  Conclusion:  Only will return if I am forced.    Disclaimer:  This review is the opinion of a person that loves to drink vast quantiles of alcohol, so sometimes views are skewed."}
{"text":"Just giving them there 4th star because it's totally a smoke free bar upstairs now!  Also still a banging steak hoagie."}
{"text":"Went on July 3rd with family. Only thing they got right was the wings and they were so-so. Mac & cheese 1st attempt that it came out was missing the panko topping and cold, 2nd attempt had topping but still cold gave up on that. The steak sub was missing veggies and the steak was still mooing. The list continues, but you get the idea. Not going back."}
{"text":"I stopped here by myself earlier today for lunch.  I walked into the upstairs bar area which has a bar on one side with about 12 seats and then a pool table and 4 high top tables on the other side.  Since the bar was pretty full I wandered to a high top table and sat down.  Having read previous reviews I was concerned about getting served but that was not a problem as the bartender quickly came out from behind the bar and over to me.  What is impressive about this place is the 50 or so draft beers they have behind the bar.  I decided to order an Ithaca Embrr Ry Porter to drink and then I went with a Reuben with an egg off of their St Patricks day menu.  After I ordered some people left the bar and seeing how I was there by myself I headed over there. Shortly thereafter I was served 3/4 of a glass of the Embrr as it had kicked.  The bartender did promise to make me only pay 3/4 of the price of it and that ended up being the case whenever my bill arrived.  Within a short amount of time my Reuben was delivered to me.  I was hungry and wasn't expecting much but man was it delicious!  The bread was toasted nicely and it was hot temperature wise and the meat was juicy.  I also really loved the egg on it as it is not something that I have had before.  It added some protein and texture and I think it went well with the dressing.  When eating my meal I heard that they had a beer area downstairs and so I went to check it out when I was done.  It was at this point that I found out they had a huge dining area adjacent to the upstairs bar as well as a whole separate bar downstairs.  They also had a ridiculous number of bottles down there although I didn't buy anything.  The bottom line for me is that I would come back here again in the future.  While I was worried before my visit that I wasn't a \"regular,\" that proved to be unfounded and I really enjoyed my food and the selection of beer here!"}
{"text":"Love coming here when I'm in town for the holidays from the west coast. They have the best spinach and artichoke dip!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow.  Went in, sat at a table, it took at least 20 minutes to get served, then another 10 to get my beer.  Food was good, but again it was a long wait to get it.   Overall good food, the just need to make the customer a priority."}
{"text":"Definitely a decent pale to swing some good bar food. Not somewhere I would go for a Saturday night. If more than 20 people were here it'd feel crowded in the main room. The food is okay (western burger is what I had), at least they use awesome bread and make fresh onion rings from why I could tell. Dart table, pool table. Had to cut it down to three stars due to small space and no smoking in the bar but there's a cigarette machine in front which doesn't make sense. All around a great place for lunch and a couple games!!"}
{"text":"Great beer and food is good also. Be prepared to hang out as the food can take awhile when they are busy."}
{"text":"Downstairs and upstairs bar with the dining room separated from the bar. Fantastic setup with the patio outside . I bet this bar during the summer is packed. I have never ever seen so many different type of beer in my life. Great service. Keep up the great work !"}
{"text":"Honestly, we're pleasantly surprised. We came because the sign outside said \"lamb chops and lamb sandwiches\" - and based on the special alone, it was worth it. The food was excellent, the lamb and also the chicken bacon mac and cheese - even though the sandwiches didn't come out at the same time and everything could have been hotter. The server tried her best, was very kind, but seemed new. We will be back."}
{"text":"We have eaten lunch here a few times and the food has been great. We had the same person waiting on us and she is wonderful. Kelly I believe her name is, she is great. Add the number of beers they have on tap and we will be back."}
{"text":"Great selections of beers and fantastic sandwiches. You will not be disappointed. It will take longer to go over the menu than you can drink it"}
