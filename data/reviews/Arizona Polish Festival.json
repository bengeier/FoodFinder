{"text":"This was so much fun! And it's one of the few festivals that are super busy but has plenty of space!!! The food was awesome, maybe just a tad pricey but you do get a good amount of food. Pierogis are amazing. The kids on stage are adorable and the beer garden is simple but very nice and spacious where you can mingle. The stage is loud but surprisingly you can have plenty of conversation without screaming over the music. Parking was free! Another great point! Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"We come out to the festival every year and it never disappoints.  I love the potato and the cabbage pierogi.  Be sure to try the Polish donuts (Packzi) as well.  There are a few booths set up which sell things like honey, olive oil, etc.  Also, there is polka dancing and polish singing on a stage.  Sit under the tent, enjoy your Polish food, and watch the entertainment."}
{"text":"We've come to this festival a few times over the years and it is a lot of fun. My wife has some Polish ancestry, but both of us are far removed from our European ancestry so this culture is not something we experience everyday.   The food is always good, pierogies, sausage, potato pancakes, and hunter stew, are something you don't experience everyday. The cultural dances and exhibits are fun to look at even if I don't always know what they are saying and being Arizona, the weather is usually excellent.  If you go, be prepared to park a few blocks away and walk and also be prepared to wait in long lines for the food. However, if you know that going in, you will have a good time."}
{"text":"What a fun valley cultural event.  Admittedly I have no ties to Poland whatsoever, but I've had enough Polish food in my life to know the Arizona Polish Festival must be on my to do list.  The parking lot of a Polish church in west Phoenix is the setting for this annual festival of food, beer, song and dance, families and tradition.  The atmosphere is festive, the smells are divine, and the Polish-Americans & Polish ex-pats are here on a mission to party.  My kind of crowd.  No charge for admission at this event which takes place at the Our Lady of Czestochowa (don't ask me to pronounce it) Parish on 28th Ave and Country Gables (about halfway between Greenway and Thunderbird).  Best way to get here is to go southbound on the I-17 frontage road from Greenway until you run into Country Gables.  The church is in a mostly residential neighborhood so rather than jockey amongst the residents, they encourage you to use the free shuttle service (which I did).  Park at the business complex on the northeast corner of 29th Ave and Greenway, where shuttles are coming by to take people to and from the event every 5 minutes.  They drop you off at the front entrance where you walk in and then go nuts!  Food and drinks are sold by tickets, so you'll need to get tickets at one of the many ticket booths at the event.  $1 dollar per ticket so $20 bought me 20 tickets.  The food and drink menu is prominently displayed at various spots throughout the event (including the ticket booths) so you know how many tickets you'll need in advance.    One item on the menu at this event stood out to me (and apparently most everyone else) more than any other.  The combo platter.  Can't decide between Polish sausage, pierogis, potato pancake, or cabbage roll?  Well don't.  Just get the platter.  Total cost for this mountain of food was 14 tickets (or $14).  We're talking a GIANT polish sausage, 3 potato pierogis, a huge potato pancake with apple sauce and sour cream, and a hearty meat and rice cabbage roll all on one plate.  Trust me, this is a steal for $14.  Fantastic, hearty, stick-to-your-ribs comfort food.  The sausage and the pierogis were fantastic, and cabbage roll was ridiculously tender.  And what Polish meal would be complete without some Polish beer?  In this case, its Okocim Brewery (a brewery in Poland of course) dishing out their Polish Pilsner.  Goes down smooth and you can order by the cup or by the pitcher here.  A cup of that smooth pils worked quite nicely for me thank you very much.  And finally the desserts.  Admittedly I probably screwed this up as there were so many choices I didn't know what to pick.  I saw some warm homemade raspberry danish they'd just put on the table so I couldn't say no to that.  Next time I'll probably get the sernik (a Polish style cheesecake), or maybe the jablecznik (a Polish style apple cake).  All in all, a delicious hearty meal that left me fat and happy.  The main stage was filled with lots of singing and dancing with a Polish band belting out Polish tunes, dancers in traditional Polish attire, and what I think was even some Polish poetry reciting at times.  I had no idea what any of them were saying since I don't speak Polish, but the energy on stage (and on the dance floor where festival goers can cut loose) was contagious.  The church does their best to cram in as many seats (with as much shade) as they can squeeze into this parking lot, but I'll admit finding seating can be tough when its packed.  My advice would be to look for seating (or for one of the stand up tables) around the beer garden area.  I would also probably get here at opening on Saturday or Sunday.  I came mid afternoon at 2:30pm on Saturday and it was definitely busy.  Great event with great culinary treats and great energy.  The proceeds from the event benefit the church and for the valley's Polish community you can tell this event is like the Super Bowl for them.  And like I said, $20 should be enough for just about anyone to come have a good time and with a good meal.  If that sounds like a good use of a weekend in late February to you, I invite you to make the trip to the Polish fest.  Polska, Bialoczerwoni!"}
{"text":"You have to get here almost as soon as they open (10am) to get anything close to a decent parking and you better know how to parallel park!! You have to drive around their residental streets to find a space along a side road or in front of a house that doesn't have some sort of barrier or sign out front. I get it, neighbors probably HATE this one weekend out of the year and all the noise, trash and other inconveniences that come along with it. This only speaks to the success of this event. It's free, there is plenty of food (and beer which probably accounts for AT LEAST half of it's success); for others it's a chance to enjoy the community vendors with games and rides for the kids. This year they had a booth with various types of honey, all from different areas in AZ.  You have to take home some glorious pastries!!"}
{"text":"We went to The Arizona Polish Festival today and Enjoyed the music, dance, food, and meeting polish locals who were extremely friendly.  What a way to bring the community closer and getting some great authentic polish food."}
{"text":"You can never have too many cultural events in Phoenix.  Coming from the Polish-rich city Pittsburgh, I've been looking forward to this festival for a very long time, and it did not disappoint!  Very tasty food and the music/performances were enjoyable...such great talent. Mmmmm Pierogies!"}
{"text":"First time attending and we were impressed with the crowd.. get here early and expect to have trouble finding a parking spot.   After walking around to see what was available to buy & eat we decided on the combo plate.. sausage, potato pancake (way too greasy), pierogi, and sausage roll.. it was a good variety ..   We then had to have dessert.. i settled for the Apple cake with crumble on top.. the Apple middle was like an apple sauce butter .. different then I expected but good..   Lots of tables under the tents to sit and enjoy the music and dance ..definitely a family event."}
{"text":"The parking was the worst part of the experience, but once you get inside the food is amazing, the music is lively, the beer is flowing, and you can't beat a great Polish get together.  This would have made anyone in my family smile.  So glad I made the trip to come.  You may have to fight some crowds, so get there early, but well worth the effort if you love Polish food and customs."}
{"text":"Well, this review was delayed. Smooth move, Bacon.  I've been wanting to attend this festival for years, but never went because I thought it was sooo far away. I'm weird. But finally made it and will be returning next year.  As others have said, the parking it a bit rough. You're in a residential area and the streets fill up quickly. You're also at a free festival, which means there may be long lines.   Their pierogis are wonderful. I also had the buckwheat sausage which I enthusiastically asked if it was blood sausage. (Earlier that week, I was talking about never eaten blood sausage and really wanted to try some). It is, and it was good. Served with a slice of bread and warm sauerkraut, it was probably the best thing I ate that day. Sadly, I didn't think to get a to-go order of all the foods I didn't eat. Oh well, there's always next year."}
