{"text":"I have never been inside the location - only ordered via Uber eats. Pasta with broccoli and pancetta was exactly what I expected and very delicious."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch sometimes. All the food is cooked by nonnas around the area.
The rice balls are to die for. The prices have rised by alot over the last few months..ever since they got the interact machine, and try to find a parking spot on st. Clair is impossible. Those ticket guys are pretty damn quick"}
{"text":"Great little Italian grocery in the heart of Corso D'Italia. I've bought pasta , cold cuts and clams from here. All was delicious. I'd like to go back to try the hot table."}
{"text":"Solid 3.  Wide selection of cheeses.  Also fresh meats, bread, and imported italian foods.  Helpful friendly service.  Clean.  Haven't tried the small restaurant side.

Side note - many customers order about 10 different items at the deli counter... if you see a big lineup you may wish to come back later."}
{"text":"Like the other guy said, a solid 3. Came here because blogto mentioned they served some classic italian dishes (none of the bougie stuff that you'll see on college). I came here in hopes of bringing back some memories of my younger years at the italian clubs in Windsor serving Friday afternoon hot plate buffet. Alas, this did not happen here.

I walked through the grocery part of it and went right to the back to order what I heard would be good, a veal sandwich. A staple cooked meat in any italian's blood (minus the vegetarian type). I ordered it in a bit of a bizarre way, I added rapini to it as it seemed they were out of peppers from what I saw. There wasn't much sauce added to the bread, so i was a bit worried it would be a little dry upon consumption. The sandwich came to 6.50 and a mineral water was 1.50, with tax it was around 9 dollars, give or take. 

I sat down at the salmon coloured tables and proceed to eat my meal while I watched golf on tv. Upon first bite, I was satisfied. The sauce (of what was on it) was nice and flavourful, but a bit on the liquid-y side (as I'm a thick and heavy sauce type of guy). The veal was actually quite tender and meaty as opposite to San Francesco's slighty tough and chewy. One good thing about the sandwich was that the veal wasn't breaded. Good sign of quality meat. Overall it was a decent sandwich. It was filling enough with little disappointment. I'd really love to check out the other food they have in the sit down area. 

As for the grocery section, the prices looked fair in the cheese section and I bet they have good cold cuts but it is a little out of my way to venture up to St. Clair for some cold cuts. This is the type of place your  Nonna shops at."}
