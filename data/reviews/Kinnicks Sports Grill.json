{"text":"Love this place!  I'm a HAWKEYE fan and recently stumbled upon this place.  It is awesome!  Food is good, atmosphere is good, and they play our HAWKEYE music after each touchdown and our \"In Heaven there is no Beer\" upon victory!  Yahoo!  Finally a place I can watch Hawkeye football amongst other fans, listen to the music, eat good food, and actually find a seat!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic atmosphere, a breath of fresh air in the staid Scottsdale sports bar scene. Great bar tender, fresh beers, game food and of course a great place to watch football now matter who your team (although of course it is best if you are  Hawkeye).    In response to Karri G., the reviewer ahead of me: It would seem a sports grill may not be the optimal locale for someone with your views to be.   That uncomfortable feeling you got when a strange woman called you (gasp) \"Sweetie\" was most likey your subconscious reacting to the fact that all who had met you that evening were counting the minutes until you left. Next time you find yourself writing a review that begins with \"this may not be a fair review\" you might consider stopping right there."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful sports bar.  Its typical bar fare but the hamburgers are huge and really really juicy.  I am glad to see something go into the old tapino spot and I think this is the right concept.  There is plenty of space to watch a game with a lot of friends."}
{"text":"Hmmm...granted, this may not be a fair review, so I do intend to visit again...  I attended a North Scottsdale Chamber Ribbon Cutting event here last night and was disappointed.  I do not think they were prepared for us...and I do not think that they cared.  Food was average in flavor and minimal was offered.  (I am not certain a new restaurant can afford to think that the small things do not matter...specifically because of sites like Yelp and people like me.)  I thought the beer special was AWESOME ($2.75) until I learned that there was no cold Lite beer.  And even more disappointed to learn that soda was more expensive than beer at this time ($2.85)!  And I don't like strange women calling me \"Sweetie.\"  Having said all that, I think this could be a great venue to watch the game...clean, plenty of separate areas for gathering around a TV, plenty of TVs."}
{"text":"4 stars for tall beers and staff.  Great Iowa Hawkeye bar but I wish they would have beat the buckeyes that day.  Good wings and a generous selection of drafts will take me back again.  I think a bar on the smoking patio would be a hit."}
{"text":"When they first opened up I would go there often for their great happy hour. 3-7 PM, half off apps.  Their wings are very good. Nice, clean (and new) place. They recently revised their happy hour now only until 6 PM, and nixed the half off apps entirely. Too bad. I'm not sure what the owner is thinking here.  Unfortunately I expect to see a closed sign within 90 days."}
{"text":"Kinnick's is off to a slow start. This was pretty much a ghost town on Thursday at lunch - the location is also a little isolated. One inexperienced server seemed to be overwhelmed by the \"crowd\" of 4 tables. The food was decent, though it took some time to get. Their pricing is more than fair and I might even suggest this as a happy hour destination - just not as a restaurant. I am rooting for this place to improve with experience as it is located on hallowed ground, the former location of Tapino, one of my all-time favorites."}
