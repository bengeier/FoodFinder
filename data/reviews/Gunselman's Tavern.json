{"text":"Always had a good time. Cheap beer, good music and the bartender Matt is always in for a good conversation. So if you're in the area and got nothing better to do, stop in!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in town to listen to live music relax and unwind with a cool vibe atmosphere great juke box and pleasant staff and best homemade chicken paprikash in the Midwest !"}
{"text":"Went up with some buddies for a night out and was really happy with the result. Great time and good feel in the bar. It lacks a kitchen but I hear that they will be rennovating in a month or two. That should really be cool and could spike business ... especially with Stampers out."}
{"text":"This friendly place fills up fast after 5 pm in this working class tavern, so get there early for a spot in the small parking lot. Good menu features daily specials. Thursday's is city chicken after 4 or so until sold out. Perfecto! Tender and crisp pork on a stick. My friend had a fried bologna sandwich, which reminded her of childhood Saturday lunches with her dad. It was our first visit, and we felt warmly welcomed as if old regulars."}
{"text":"Good as it gets for a hip ol' man style of bar! That's hip not hipster y'all. Totally cool as hell, with all the old wood paneling and red 4 man booths. It really looks like the 1930's in there. Old style, but it's very modern with it's ability to be able to pay with my iPhone's applepay. Some of these old joints are cash only on the West side of Cleveland. Kinda stoked about that! Lot's of live music and the crowd is kinda eclectic, with both young and old on any given nite. No food, but they do have food trucks on Fridays... I think. I know when they open a kitchen (which I heard they're working on over the winter) and a new outdoor patio, we'll be going there earlier in the evening. I grew up in Fairview Park and I for one am glad this place is still around...had no Idea it would end up being this cool. Cudos Gunny's...now serve the food already."}
{"text":"Greatest restaurant/bar I've ever eaten/drank at PERIOD. Seriously it was just so damn good I love it everything is so good I just couldn't pick a favorite so please go you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Good vibe, sat at the bar. Didn't try the food but it looked good. Service was outstanding and beer was cold"}
{"text":"Friendly crowd, friendly service, nice little place to hang out. Great mix on the jukebox. Cool, fun place to spend some time -- and apparently frequented by real people, not the likenesses you typically encounter in the NEOH 'burbs. Not overrun by bros and cheerleaders, either. They seem to be adding an extra room and an outdoor patio, at the moment. I'll def be back if I'm looking to meet up with friends in the area."}
{"text":"The burgers are as billed but you have to get the Big G for the full effect.  Sides are great too.  Burger is in competition with Johnny's little bar."}
{"text":"Great pub food. Their burgers are fantastic and they have a decent craft beer selection. Friendly service and overall good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I stopped in here last Thursday for a drink prior to choir rehearsal.  I had about 45 minutes, and figured I could kill time with a beer.

I could not find the door on this place.  I walked around the building, went in a wrong door, and finally came to the non-descript brown-painted door (which opens in) with nothing on it.  I \"pushed\" the door open and voila, a bar!  (For the directionally challenged, it is the door right on the corner of the building.  And make sure you push the door to go in and pull to go out....I'm pretty sure this is backwards, but who cares when the bar is good!)  

The place is a decent size with booths, tables, and a bar.  I didn't peek into the adjoining room, but I figured it was more of the same.  Gunselman's does not serve food, but they sell bags of chips / pretzels for a buck.  I asked the bartender if you could have food delivered and she said people often order some 'za from Santos across the street and then walk over to pick it up and bring it back.  This sounded pretty good to me.  The bartender even offered me the menu.

Gunselman's has good beer on tap too, not quite what I expected from a dive like this.  I was pleasantly surprised to see Left Hand Milk Stout on tap, and yeah baby it $2 drafts!!!    

Gunselman's is definitely a local bar with a great bartender and good beer.  I like it."}
{"text":"I'm looking forward to trying a other items on the menu the next time we come. The steak sandwich and buffalo chicken salad were great. It would be nice to have a few other beers on tap but overall a wonderful surprise. I've driven by this place a few times."}
{"text":"The tavern is not very classy and is old and worn .Food was great , the soda is all generic. The waitress  was good but there dress attire was very poor and the cook was a bit slow .The restrooms were average . Parking is on the street . They do have a patio off to the side and unusual monthly specials"}
{"text":"Excellent service every time I go there. Wife and I have had many meals there to our surprise as the food is excellent and the drinks are served quickly without any sort of wait.

It's hard to find such a gem and to have one within walking distance is priceless and enjoyed by many. Definitely known as Fairview Parks favorite corner bar but now better with superior food with their new Kitchen."}
{"text":"Love that Gunselmans finally has food.  Stopped in for Sunday brunch, it was excellent. Loved the Bloody Mary bar. In the past we have also had their burgers which were delicious. Last night we stopped in and ordered the chicken wings....a little disappointing. It looked like the wings were taken off of a Cornish hen. They were the tiniest wing we had ever seen. We will continue to go back and see what's new and different!"}
{"text":"We Paid our bill...  Leave 15 minutes later.   The other bartender chases me down in parking lot... \"You want to pay your tab.\"  Me:  \"I did\".  So RUDE and classless. Not a friendly place anymore!!!"}
{"text":"Love this little neighborhood bar. I've been coming for sporting events and beer for quite some time and today was the first time I had their food. The burger was outstanding!  What's better is the fries were served with a side of nacho cheese. This should get 6 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Matt our bartender rocked our world. Came a long way to be here. Food was great. Matt totally took care of us. Glad we stayed!  Perch and wings were awesome. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Holy dive bar! Stopped by because they were supposed to have a beer I wanted to try on tap, sadly they did not have it tapped yet, but we decided to stay for a beer anyway. Very laid back and mostly the few people that were there on a Friday night seemed to be of the silver haired variety, so not exactly a happenin' place unless you wanted to meet a cougar or a Santa Claus impersonator. (Maybe I was just there on a slow night?)

Not exactly my kind of place since they don't serve food and we all know I like to eat, but no bad vibes from this low-key neighborhood bar so I'd suggest it if that's your type of spot!"}
{"text":"No frills, no bullcrap.....just a great place with fun bartenders, great beer selection and very inexpensive.  They dont have food but you can bring in whatever you want."}
{"text":"One and done for us

It was all fine, but I was charged $12 for a shrimp PO boy that had 5 shrimp and some slaw on one folded piece of toast. 

My husband had the grown up grilled cheese with egg - $10. He said it was good, especially when the bread started to soak up the egg. He also got a side of Brussel Sprouts which he enjoyed 

The fries were good! 

All in all - it was ok. Nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"Time has passed with the kitchen and seem to have worked some of the issues.  Need to check out taco night but seem to offer some specials that are priced fair.  Food is solid and accept it'll never be priced as the Fairview Tavern.

Beer cooler rocks but bar service is slow if crowded.  Hopefully will add some tables to the patio.  

Keeping the community happy and think the place is gonna be alright."}
{"text":"Hey, turn off Uber eats if you can't handle it.  Better that than delivering half the items orders at half the temp required to eat it at.  Have a microwave ready if you order for carry out.  I thought delivery times were atrocious when I sat at the bar at lunch.  I live 10 min away and got my food 1.5 hours later, cold, done not as requested and completely missing a side they were apparently out of.  Do t call me and ask for a sub, just tell the delivery driver to have me take it up with Uber.  Great burger, shitty service."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch. Great food, bloodymary bar and good mimosas. Wonderful outside patio too!"}
{"text":"Burgs are great but can't figure out why the buns are always ice cold. One server told my wife and I that heating the bun is at the discretion of the cook. We were there Friday and asked to have our buns grilled thinking that would make them warm. Nope...cold again. We asked the server and she went and checked. Came back and said the owner was going the cooking and he grilled the buns. End of conversation. Also getting drinks is painstakingly slow. When we were there there were four people at the bar. We were sitting at a high top right near the door. Bartender was at the opposite end of the bar bsing with someone. Server entered the drink order. Which comes up on a machine at the bar. Bartender never checked machine forever. Once he did he went to the opposite end of the bar and got my wife's wine. Took it to the other end of the bar and set it down for the server then he came back to the same cooler the wine was in and got my beer and took it to the other end of the bar again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Overall a great experience. Steak sandwich is excellent. Wednesday night special is the homemade chicken paprikash and is excellent. Definitely worth stopping in and meeting the owners and their staff."}
{"text":"Gunselmans is a hole in the wall with great food!  Not much more needs said.  Not flashy...not pricey...just a good bar with a great menu."}
{"text":"Not much to add to the first review here. Plenty of professional drinkers. Great bartender. Really surprising and amazing beer selection. Bowling machine, but it was off when we were there. I'll return to see if it gets turned on at some point, and console myself with something great off the tap if it doesn't. Good place."}
