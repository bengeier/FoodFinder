{"text":"Ordered the beef fried rice and general tso chicken and both were good, no complaints I would order from here again. Something worth noting is that for their chicken fried rice you have to request real chicken, which  I think is wrong, they'll use a turkey roll substitute if you order without asking for real chicken"}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese takeout place in Cleveland Heights. No frills, basic Americanized Chinese dishes. Don't go in expecting an authentic meal and you'll be fine. We always get the Family Dinners for 2 people. It's enough food for 5-6 meals for $30. The \"Beef and Broccoli\" and \"General's Chicken\" are our usual choices. When I'm craving Chinese takeout, this is where I go."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally have China Gate back in the neighborhood. My family has been going there for years. They were super busy but we didn't have to wait too long and as usual the portions were huge, the price's were still cheap and the food was still the best around."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Chinese food in a 15 mile radius. The best Chinese food hands down. So authentic compared to majority of Chinese places nowadays. Their wonton soup and f wind rice actually has a large amount of meat in it. Potions are huge and overall the food is amazing. Best authentic Chinese food in the area no doubt about it. My mom is 60 and can't believe how authentic this place is, she compares it to her childhood Chinese places she would go to. COME HERE SO AMAZING!!! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"get take out from here once a month - fast service and mostly pleasant service   hot pepper chicken and soups always good  chicken or vegetable fried rice can be greasy (than usual) at times"}
{"text":"Good food, happy employees. Got the chicken Lo mein, was a little dry but had potential. Humongous portions. Would go again!"}
{"text":"It's nice family owned take-out place.  The food was good, what you would expect.  My only gripe is that they close too early."}
{"text":"Great Family owned business, the Wongs.  We've ordered from their new incarnation many times since the reopening and have never been disappointed.  First, the portions are huge, the prices are not.  Soups, Won Ton, Hot and Sour and Egg Drop, are really tasty.  Won Ton has pork, noodles, greens.  Fantastic.  For appetizers we've had their tasty egg rolls, pot stickers as well as the ribs.  All very good, very enjoyable.  Entrees, as stated above, are typically huge.  We always have leftovers which are great for the next day.  The excellent dishes we've tried to date include:  Egg Foo Young (various meats); Sweet and Sour Chicken; Sweet and Sour Pork; Moo Goo Gai pan; Sesame Chicken; Orange Chicken; General Tso's Chicken; Pepper Steak with Onions; Shrimp in Lobster Sauce; and Chicken Subgum Chow Mein.  There are many other dishes we are looking forward to trying.  While there is a small sit down area available, just a few seats, this is really a take out restaurant.  They do get busy so calling in your order ahead of time is recommended.  I've never had to wait on pickup, meals are ready as promised in the time promised.  This restaurant is owned and run by a wonderful family  I think its well worth trying.  They never miss for us."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped by China Gate after a movie in the Galleria.  We had eaten there before when it was called Mark Pi's China Gate.  The food was very good.  I think it's changed hands and here's why.  We were seated and given menus.  We placed our order with the waiter and not less than 3 minutes later, ALL of our food was brought out.  I was shocked.  There was no way this order was prepared and cooked that fast.  My son took one bite, I didn't even bother, and we called the waiter back over.  I told her I expected fresh food, not some hidden buffet that had been sitting out.  I got up to leave and she called the manager who tried to force me to pay.  I refused.  I will never go back.  There is such a thing as food too fast.  If I wanted fast food I'd have gone to Mickey D's."}
{"text":"The best egg rolls you'll ever have! Big and crunchy. The Sesame chicken is great and all of the fried rice options overflow the container with meat."}
{"text":"Not bad but not the best either. Beware...portions are huge. Their combo plates are a bargain and substitutions are welcome. Just had the chicken lo mein. Plenty for 3 to 4 people. Also a combo plate of pork egg foo young and extra fried rice instead of an eggroll. A quart of wonton soup was very flavorful loaded with huge pieces of pork and packed with wonton and the green leaves ( not sure what the plant leaves are).  China gate has been at cedar center since Moses parted the Red Sea. They're now primarily carryout although they do have a couple of tables if you want to eat there, but not ideal."}
{"text":"My favorite thus far Chinese restaurant . Very friendly especially Peter . Served fresh and best egg rolls with house made duck sauce . Best hot oils as well to compliment your food with a kick . And very reasonable priced"}
{"text":"We eat out a lot and love Chinese, but this place has gone over the years from excellent to OK to bad. Tonight was the worst experience we have had for a very long time. The waitress arrived promptly, took our drink orders, and then disappeared for about 30 minutes, finally showing up with my wine, but no water (for which we had to ask three times!). After another quarter of an hour, she shows up again, takes our order, reappearing in another quarter of an hour with one of the entrées, but no appetizers. She takes back the entrée and five minutes later brings the egg roll and soup (but still no water!). Then she brings the entrées, one if which was the one I had sent back (it had not even been reheated! ) and another which was not the one my husband had ordered. Finally, we get the correct one, but by now it was also a bit on the cool side. Then we had to had to ask for rice, which did arrivé fairly promptly. It took nearly a half hour to get the bill, which was wrong (we were undercharged by one glass of wine). So, we paid the bill, including for the missing wine and left, two and a half hours after we arrived. The restaurant is understaffed, poorly managed, and the staff is badly trained. Too bad. Several years ago, it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food i have ever had always hot and fresh. I love everything thing I get but my favorite is their sesame chicken with house rice and egg roll with the best homemade duck sauce!!!! Amazing"}
{"text":"I was disappointed from my last visit to China Gate restaurant.  Let me state that this latest version of CG nowhere compares with the original CG sit down restaurant at Cedar Center plaza.  Tonight I ordered their famous wonton soup and egg rolls.  Maybe the woks were on the slow side tonight, because both items were kinda Meh.   :/"}
{"text":"Ok. So I decided to try this place one last time. My first two visits the food was terrible.  That was not long after they reopened.  After reading a few good reviews I decided to try them again.  I was pleasantly surprised.  They're not yet back to where they used to be with their food but it wasn't bad.  I had the pork egg foo young lunch portion.  The rice was fresh and the egg foo young was good, not great but good. The egg roll was just ok.  I'm glad that I decided to give them another try.  Let's hope they keep improving."}
{"text":"Finally a good chinese restaurant! The good was that the food tasted amazing. The rangoons were soooo good and the I ordered the lunch special of shrimp fried rice and the portion was huge! For 6 bucks for that large portion I will definitely be back, there was alot of shrimp for the price as well. Good bang for your buck. Only flaw was that they charge for extra sauce. I've never had to pay for a extra pack of soy, duck, and hot mustard:( The was seriously a bummer, especially since it's like a staple for me. I tried the vegetable egg roll as well and it was decent, nothing to brag about, but I will for sure be back to try out something else."}
{"text":"Best wonton soup I've had in a while. Not too salty. Only one small rice for two large entrees was disappointing but quality was very good, next time I'll just ask for more steamed rice. We ordered beef and broccoli and war sue gai."}
{"text":"The BEST Chinese food in the area.  They've custom made dishes for me in the past if I wasn't feeling something on the menu. Portions are HUGE and ingredients super fresh!!"}
{"text":"The General Tso Chicken was the best I've ever had; plump and well-cooked all chicken breast, lightly battered with green pepper slices, although not enough vegetables in a mildly spicy sauce. The Chicken Egg Foo Young was just as good--fresh and not overcooked where many restaurants tend to scorch the bottom of the cakes.  Fried rice was nothing special but enjoyable as well. Fresh and tasty egg roll was included in the combo deal. The portions of everything were huge and really double the size compared to others. None of this food was sitting under a heat lamp waiting to be served. Prices were fair especially for the large portions; definitely will have plenty for left-overs. I've been to many Chinese-American restaurants over the years, and must say that China Gate is probably the best in the Cleveland area and beyond."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place has good reviews. Trailer park quality. They don't devein shrimp before putting inside egg rolls or fried rice. The sesame  chicken had way too much vinegar. The fried rice was, sorry to say, terrible. Never going here again."}
{"text":"We've eaten here quite a few times now and we are so happy with our neighborhood Chinese Restaurant.  The store is very clean and the food is made fresh with fresh ingredients.  We highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here recently with my husband and a friend. Luncheon buffet was already closed, which was fine with me as I abhor buffets.  Friend got something plain like chicken &broccoli and thought it was good. Whatever I got was forgettable. The reason for this review was to report that my husband's usual done to death General Tso chicken, which was actually the best GT chicken I've ever had bar none. I kept picking off my husband's plate. I would much rather have this than the over hyped Panera"}
{"text":"This place has the best potstickers in all of Cleveland. They're hand-made, and there are 7 of them in one order, even though the menu says 6. That's 7 for $5.50! The dough is crispy on the outside but thick and chewy, and the meat inside is flavorful and juicy. The sauce is a sweet soy sauce mixed with Chinese black vinegar. I pretty much go here and order the potstickers only. I have tried a few other menu items, and everything else is solid plus the portions are huge. And they are fast. But, most of all, the POTSTICKERS OMG!"}
{"text":"This is our go to Chinese carry-out. Always consistently good and better than all the other places around. It's Americanized Chinese food so don't expect China Town- thats a whole different level of asian food goodness."}
{"text":"Super excited that China Gate came back after a several year hiatus. For as long as I can remember, my (Jewish) family would go there for our traditional Christmas Eve dinner. We were lost without you China Gate.... But now you are back and we are able to enjoy your delicious, huge portions-always reasonably priced. My mother still occasionally finds your old 10% off coupons in random coat pockets and purses and reminisces about the good times we have had there. I highly recommend this spot if you are in the mood for some good Chinese."}
{"text":"This is the best chinese takeout in the neighborhood. I used to go here as a teen before they tore down the old cedar center, I was so excited when it came back. I still remember the owner from back then. Good food. Nice people."}
{"text":"Want to tell the people this is the best take out Chinese in the area.   Wonton soup is loaded with noodles, pork and is very tasty!!  Sweet and Sour Pork was tasty and light on the breading tasting mostly chicken bites and sweet and sour sauce. We asked them not to include green peppers in order. We also ordered beef and broccoli. Very good!!  The fried rice is good when reheating suggest to add little water cause it gets dry. The egg rolls and ribs with the combination dinner for 2 filled us up but still had room for our meal.   Have tried the Lo Mien which is okay have had better but mostly everything else is very good.   We had leftovers for a couple days. High recommend and call up cause your dinner will be ready in less then 30 mins."}
{"text":"Great quality take out. Everything was very fresh. Had sweet and sour chicken, chicken fried rice and general Tso chicken. Also egg rolls are amazing! Will come back again."}
{"text":"So just finished my meal with my family here and I will not go back! The waitress who I don't know her name because it was never shared was polite and efficient. The only redeeming quality I found in the meal was my 2 glasses of wine! Not that the food was bad it just wasn't good! I ordered Moo Shoo Pork with 4 \"Chinese\" pancakes. Once it arrived I was looking forward to it as the main dish looked appetizing. Then I opened my \"Chinese\" pancakes... OMG they served me steamed tortillas! I was expecting the crepe style Chinese pancakes and instead I had flour tortillas steamed!!! Growing up and just having moved to Pittsburgh from the West Coast I KNOW a tortilla when I'm served one and it wasn't even handmade freshly cooked tortillas that you get at a chain joint like Chevy's but pull em out of the bag from Giant Eagle tortilla! This not only killed the meal but when the $100.00+ tab came I was aghast! My wife and two kiddos had decent meals but just because you serve large portions doesn't mean you're serving 100 dollars worth of food! I felts cheated by high prices for mediocre chinese (notice the little C) food from a place that used to be rated as  great Chinese restaurant but that was back in 1996 as the plaques on the wall gleefully point out; but only seem to notice on your way out!"}
{"text":"Please understand that after decades of ownership, the original China Gate family sold this restaurant, including its name to new owners.  The wonderful food many of us grew up with is gone--GONE.  I figured that I would give the new owners some time to get the kinks out so I waited a couple of months to try the food.  Vegetable Egg Roll--half empty and void of any authentic tastes.  Vegetable Fried Rice--so many bean sprouts--well, that IS a veggie--but hardly any rice?  And it was pretty tasteless.  And General Tso Chicken--mostly all celery and very little chicken.  Not going back-which is a shame--because the original owners made quality products that were delicious.  Not so with this ownership."}
{"text":"Best Chinese takeout I've found in the area since I moved here a year ago. The chicken is real white meat chicken, not processed mystery chicken you so often get in Chinese takeout around here. Quick friendly service."}
{"text":"In the few months we've lived in the area, China Gate has become our go-to for Chinese takeout.    We order from there often enough that the proprietors recognize me on sight.  Prices are low, especially for the portion size (we get at least two and up to four meals out of each entree).  Your food is ready within 10-20 minutes and always tastes hot and fresh.  They enthusiastically oblige if you ask for something to be \"extra spicy.\"  It's a hole-in-the-wall and while they do have a few tables  and a TV, their website has \"to go\" in the URL and it's really just a takeout place.  Run-down of dishes we've tried: --Their General Tso's is excellent, especially if you ask for extra heat (or if you're my husband, extra extra heat).  -- The orange chicken is very good as well-- he says it's definitely better than Panda's. --  Hunan chicken extra spicy is also very good, apparently.   --My most frequent order is the egg foo young, but I will warn you it has a lot of bean sprouts so buyer beware if you're not a fan of those.  The gravy isn't the best I've had, but the omelet part itself is excellent.  -- The special ho fun noodles with beef are great.   -- We've really enjoyed the vegetable fried rice.  It tastes really fresh and has a lot of variety in it.   --We like their crab rangoons (our appetizer of choice the vast majority of the time), steamed dumplings and egg rolls.   --You can get a lot of dishes in combo meals that come with pork fried rice and an egg roll, which is a really good deal.  (Everything else just comes with white rice.) --I'm not a huge fan of their lo mein, but it's not bad. --The only dish I've haven't liked is the kung pao-- too heavy on the celery for my liking.  There's a Panda Express in the same parking lot, but why would you go there when you could buy bigger portions of better food for cheaper from a local family?"}
{"text":"I work, but don't live in the area, so I don't know which Chinese take out place can be trusted. China Gate can be trusted. I'd tried two other places in the area, and began to count my lucky stars for the places in my area. The other places were cheap, but awful. China Gate is reasonably priced and the food was on par with my expectation of Chinese take out. I got the Chicken Lo Mein lunch combo. It was a good portion, and tasted good. Unless encouraged to go elsewhere, I'm going to stick with China Gate for the occasional Chinese for lunch."}
{"text":"An article I once read in the Tribune-Review said that Chinese food has gone from exotic to good old fashioned American comfort food.  It's also what you get when you're too tired to cook or when you're running around, getting last minute shopping done.    As my Cousin Cindy & I were.  We met up at the Galleria, which is kinda-sorta half way between Downtown (where I work) and Bethel Park (where she lives).    China Gate--Mark Pi's food can best be described as what you'd get in a typical strip mall Chinese place, only in a more upscale setting.  The decor here is actually very nicely done.  The food though is your everyday Americanized Chinese chow.  You've got your eggdrop and wonton soups, your eggrolls and springrolls, your pot stickers, and your typical chicken, beef, and seafood dishes here.  And of course your General Tso's Chicken.    I went for their Amazing Chicken--fried chicken in a cherry sauce with broccoli on the side.  I believe my cousin went for Orange Chicken.  And of course we each had the hot-n-sour soup and an eggroll.    The food here is good, but it's really nothing you haven't seen before.  And you'll notice that a surprisingly large number of menu items are fried.  On the whole, if you're in the mood for some Chinese, or if you want something else besides chain places, you'll get a decent meal here."}
{"text":"Looking to see what China Gate had to offer, I stopped by on a recent Monday night with a friend. The decor is pleasant and the set up is nice- being open to the other levels of the Galleria allows for an interesting view. We were one of only 3 tables occupied in the restaurant. The menu is quite large with many Chinese and Japanese selections. I decided on the edamame and the teriyaki chicken. The edamame arrived quickly. Standard, not much to report there. Within a few minutes, my teriyaki arrived. It was described on the menu as being a healthy choice though I question how accurate that is as it was heavily coated in sauce. The accompanying veggies (cabbage, carrots, etc) were crisp and flavorful. Now for the reason for 3 stars. The food was average. It did not excite or disgust me. The waitress was not very professional or attentive. Little things throughout the meal such as her giving me a box rather than boxing my leftovers, forgetting to fill waters and sitting at the bar eating and talking to the bartender when we left, will result in me going elsewhere when seeking to satisfy a Chinese craving."}
{"text":"Really glad they returned and reopened. My family and I frequented this restaurant dating back to the 80s until it was torn-down with the rest of Cedar Center around 2007 (sad time) . It was great then and is just as  great now! (minus the ability to dine in like before for they are now mainly a take out restaurant minus the 2 small tables) .   My favorites have always been the Beef and Broccoli ,  Sweet and Sour chicken and the Veggie Egg Rolls.  A hint to those that don't know, they will gladly let you substitute the white rice that comes with some dishes for a pint of fried rice for an extra $2 to me its worth it since they really pack it in like all the dishes. The food doesn't  even fit in the cartons, they tie plastic bags over the cartons and put rubber bands around the boxes because they overflow. You will be happy with the portions if you have a huge appetite like myself or like to have food left over for the next day. (Damn I'm fiending again from writing this have to go again this week.;)"}
{"text":"You've tried the rest, now have THE best!  Anyone who has any taste knows that they will have the best meal ever here. I have been visiting China Gate since childhood and the food today was as amazing as I remember it. Huge portions and a great value. The won ton soup is the best I've ever had. Delicious egg rolls, fried rice and fresh shrimp chips I can't stop eating. I fly in from Miami for this feast! You won't go wrong at China Gate!!"}
{"text":"Portions are huge but they get a lot of complaints. The old man working cash register is a total PR*ck. The expo guy bringing out your food is much nicer. Portions huge. Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall American-Chinese carry-out joint has three things going for it.  1. Large portion sizes. I'm a big eater and I've never finished one of their entrees in one sitting.  2. Good, fresh ingredients. Meat is not over-breaded. Vegetables seem fresh. Very good eggs rolls --- I assume they are made from scratch at that location.  3. Fast, no-nonsense service.  On the downside, the flavor of their dishes probably won't wow you. At best they could be said to \"lack complexity\" (e.g., their orange and General Tso's is just the typical sugary sauce you'd expect from any Chinese carry-out). At worst they could be described as bland (e.g., the cashew chicken, kung pao chicken, black bean chicken, and especially the sesame chicken leave a lot to be desired, in my opinion).  Taken together, if you're looking for a lot of American-Chinese food but without intricate flavors, China Gate is about as good as it gets. If you want more emphasis on flavor and authenticity, check out Richie Chan's on Lee Road."}
{"text":"I have left Cleveland and I wish I could take China Gate with me. My girlfriend tells me of the old China Gate days and could not be happier that they have reopened.   As my mother-in-law says, \"the portions are so big, it's really reasonably priced, and their sweet and sour chicken tastes freshly fried.\" Truer words were never spoken. If you get her seal of approval that really says something. I crave China Gate regularly and cannot wait to go back to the 216 for some takeout."}
{"text":"Our go-to Chinese restaurant. It is only a 4 star because it is your typical Chinese pick-up only restaurant. However, their food is always fresh and they have delicious crab Rangoon. Some of the best wonton soup I have had as well. The serving portions or huge, one meal is enough for two people. They don't deliver which is frustrating."}
{"text":"Excellent orange chicken and fried rice. When they say white meat chicken they mean it, no mystery meat here, it's extremely tasty! Loved it!"}
{"text":"\"Authentic\" American Chinese food. It's a take-out joint and not really a restaurant. Good thing is the price is reasonable for the amount of food. Not many choices in the area and so beggars can't be choosers."}
{"text":"First of all, the Heights area is in desperate need of a good Chinese restaurant.  China Gate could be one of, if not the best, options out there.  We've ordered from China Gate once before, and since Happy Buddha is closed for the month of July, I decided to try them again.  I am glad I did.  My daughter ordered the sesame chicken, and I specified white meat.  Their sauce is clear instead of the typical brown, but very tasty.  The chicken was quality white meat, and not overly breaded.  I ordered Szechuan fried rice (w/chicken and shrimp).  While it was not very spicy, the quantity was ridiculous.  In fact, that goes for both dishes, as we had a significant amount of leftovers for the next day.  The egg rolls were also very good.  I am looking forward to ordering from China Gate again so I can try some other menu items, and get a better feel for what they have to offer.  So far, so good..."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised whenever I checked into China Gate and it had a lower than average rating. I was curious as to how my meal was going to be because I've had some bad Chinese before.  My friend Brandi & I did painting with a twist at the Galleria during the mall's art week. She had been to China Gate before and explained to me how cute it was, so we both agreed to eat here.   The restaurant is upstairs in a loft-like area of the Galleria and you can see some of the mall from here.  My friend and I weren't extremely hungry and we noticed that the plates were pretty large, so we decided to split a plate of general tso's. We also ordered white rice as a side and egg rolls for appetizers. No complaints on the food. It wasn't bad at all. The only spotty thing was i had track down the server for a water refill when my water was empty for awhile and there were only a few other people in the restaurant. Other than that (which honestly isn't a big deal at all) it was satisfying,  Oh, there is also a full bar [thumbs up emoji]"}
{"text":"Eh. good, but not great. I liked that they offered complimentary tea and shrimp chips while we waited for our order. The eat-in area wasn't too cozy, I would reccomend take-out."}
{"text":"Great food for very reasonable prices especially the lomein! Very generous portions!!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for truly good Chinese food since I moved to Cleveland nearly 10 years ago. (Nothing has ever been able to compare to what I remember from my childhood in the Boston area.) Somehow I missed the \"old\" China Gate, but am delighted to have found them now that they've reopened. China Gate offers the best Chinese food in our area hands down. So far I have only tried the egg roll, crab rangoon and house lo mein, but all are delicious. I think I may have to put China Gate on my speed dial! ;-) Thank you for the wonderful food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"China Gate has always had delicious food, generous proportions that were a real value. The new owners (they say they're nieces but I donno) have managed to turn decades of success into dust.  In just 2 orders: they managed to get the order completely mixed up. (I don't remember that ever happening before) and since it's a to go place, I was sent  home with an un-recognizeable order of...?  Each time they miscalculated the total generously in their favor. Ok. So new owners, mistakes can happen....but then a half hour ago when I decided to forgive and try one more time, it became clear that it wasn't going to get better. Never ever being over charged by the previous owners, the price this time was insulting. They argued that was the price until someone emerged from the back and corrected their mistake. Only problem was they somehow made for me fried rice with beef (yuck) which was much different than Beef with broccoli i ordered. No apologies, just arguing ( with me as well as the unfortunate person ahead of me. Mistakes happen however 3 x and I'm done. So sad."}
{"text":"Eh, I wasn't crazy about this place. My sesame shrimp was just ok and nothing exciting. The same could be said about the almond puff dessert. The steamed dumplings were pretty good, though. The service was not great at all. Weirdly enough it's inside the Galleria right above Dragonfire in an open loft."}
{"text":"We always go to China gate. The food is good with lots of veggies and meat in the egg foo young and fried rice. The portions are large and the egg rolls are scrumptious They have been a staple in this community for more than a decade. I am glad they relocated into the new commercial strip mall in South Euclid."}
{"text":"My buddy wrote to me and said I should do a review of Mark Pi's China Gate. To be completely honest, I thought I had. I checked and saw that indeed, I had not. It's been a good six months since my last visit, I remember what I ordered and how good the entire experience was.  I ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce and an order of bok choy which was steamed first, then quickly stir fried, delicious. The eggplant was tender, a touch of heat from chilis, garlicky, meaty and filling, served with brown rice, very nutritious. My family all ordered something different, Judy, my cousin who thinks China Gate is the finest Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, and would come here at the drop of a hat, ordered her Chicken and Green Beans. I must admit, when I did eat meat, I've had this on many occasions and it's really very good. The green beans are crisp tender, the chicken is finely ground,  moist, and tender.  Over all Mark Pi's China Gate is good Chinese food, served in a nice atmosphere, and a great value for your hard earned buck."}
{"text":"Simply the best Chinese food I have ever eaten! A family-owned business that offers amazing carry-out food. We enjoyed the fresh egg rolls, potstickers, seafood and noodles, ribs, chicken and pork fried rice, beef skewers, and the General Tso chicken. The owners are incredibly friendly and I will definitely be going back for more carry-out orders whenever I am in town. I highly recommend China Gate!"}
{"text":"The food was really good but the service kinda sucked. I ordered by food ahead of time for pick up and when I went in the insisted that I never placed an order. I had to sit there for an additional 15-minutes cause they couldn't find it (or they forgot it and made it really quick). But it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to China Gate. My wife and I chose this place due to the outstanding ratings and reviews here on Yelp. We live in Mayfield so we have quite a selection of local places but none seem to quite click with both myself and my wife. We figured no better way to know unless we order. We got the app crab Rangoon and 2 combo meals, sweet n sour chix and general Tso. Comes with rice and an egg roll. After getting to taste both I can say... WOW!! Just outstanding!! First off the flavor is unbelievable, the general has some heat to it but not so much to ruin the flavor and the sweet sour sauce is a thing of beauty. The pork fried rice has almost like a Smokey flavor to it that really helps cut some of the sweet from the meals. The egg rolls that come with the combo are as my wife puts it \"Exactly like the ones I had as a child\" at her parents local place. Everything about the combos were perfect. And the amount that you get is very large too. As far as my wife and I are concerned This will be our new place. I can handle the little extra trip for so much extra flavor.  And I wouldn't be happy if I forgot to mention the Rangoon. Out of this world. The sauce in the center is creamy and the crunch on the outside was perfect. Over all I have this 5 stars because clearly they earned it. Way to go! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Chinese spots in Cleveland. I only had there lunch and it was at very nice price with huge portions of food. Everything was made fresh which is a good thing. Def will be my go to spot whenever I have a taste for Chinese. The place is very small so it's not really a eat in place more for take out."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese Restaurants around. I usually have the General Tso Chicken which is always spicy and good. The portion sizes are huge so you won't go hungry."}
{"text":"We really like China gate. It's your typical Chinese take out food. I haven't tried anything out of the ordinary but everything I have had has been great!"}
{"text":"Alright.  They aren't too busy for us anymore, so we've tried the food here twice, now updating my review.  It's okay.  It's your typical Americanized Chinese fare, with some good dishes and some not so good. The lo mein noodles are fairly standard and tasted decent enough.  The happy family combination was also cooked well.  On the other hand, the orange chicken was overbreaded and the pieces of chicken were way too large, so it did not soak in the orange flavor properly.  The egg rolls were supposed to have pork and shrimp in them but there was so little meat that they tasted like vegetarian egg rolls.  So yes, sort of hit and miss, but I don't expect much from Americanized Chinese food, so I'll probably order from here again.  As long as they don't shoo me away again."}
{"text":"I got the spicy fried rice and it is very good! The shrimp are deveined which is amazing! Perfect amount of heat in my opinion. And the portion size for a medium can feed 2-3 people! Will definitely come back for lunch when I'm craving Chinese."}
{"text":"Currently sitting in the restaurant. Got seated very quickly, around 7:10pm. For the first time ever, the restaurant actually had more than myself and my fiancé in it. We sat until 7:30 without so much as a \"Hello\" from a nearby server. People were sat after us and have already received food. We finally had to go up to the front to tell the hostess we had not been addressed. She then came and took our orders herself and finally just filled our water glasses. I've never received great service here, but it's never been this subpar either. This may be the last straw for this place. Three strikes and you're out, Mark-Pi.  P.S. I ordered a Diet Coke, and received a glass of what seems to be Robitussin. That, or there's alcohol in this drink. Either case, I'm not thrilled."}
{"text":"I'd forgotten how much I loved China Gate before it closed as its been gone so long! After seeing how downhill Hunan on Coventry has gone and now Sun Luck is disgusting, I was about to throw in the towel on anything but Amazing Wok style eats unless I was willing to go to Chinatown. I'm so glad China Gate is back! It's not the fanciest of chinese takeout but its GOOD.  It also didn't make me sick unlike most other local joints do.  If you like just good quality, Americanized Chinese food, this is your place.  Thank you China Gate!"}
{"text":"Their food is delicious!  They also have fresh sushi. The only thing I've had that I have not cared for is their hibatchi. I had the hibatchi chicken and my friend had hibatchi shrimp. They were both dry. We were disappointed because normally the food is outstanding. Lesson learned. Stick to the Chef's specialties and the sushi."}
{"text":"Not the same delicious food as the former owners. Actually very disappointed. End of the China gate era! Wonton soup had no taste. Egg rolls okay but  definitely different than before. 2nd time we were shorted on an egg roll. Will not return!"}
{"text":"It had been several years since I visited this restaurant.  I used to dine here almost every Sunday for a marvelous buffet that regrettably, is no longer offered.  This was our second choice.  We had tried to get into the newly-opened BRGR downstairs, but were told that there was a ninety to one hundred twenty minute wait to get into the loud and raucous atmosphere, in which diners are placed in very close proximity to others: no, thanks.  No meal is worth waiting that long for, and it is probably just as well that there would not be any tables available until well into the evening because it is not a pleasant place to eat.  We enjoyed the quiet of China Gate.  What sets this restaurant apart from others is its beautiful space in the region's most exclusive and lovely mall.  Both sides of the restaurant offer a view of the lower level of the mall, enabling the diner to engage in interesting people-watching throughout the meal.  Our server was a woman who used to serve as buffet busser.  Her command of English is not great, but good enough.  She is pleasant and provided good and attentive service with regular plate-clearing and water refills.  The crispy noodles with which the meal begins are delicious, a great first course.    I ordered pork egg roll and pork lo mein.  The egg roll was not very good because it was not hot.  The lo mein was priced relatively high at $10.00, but it was worth it as it was ample and delicious.  It was also very salty as evidenced by the amount of water I felt compelled to consume after dinner.  My wife ordered mixed vegetables with tofu and brown rice.  It was also a good portion and prepared well.  Those who regularly dine at area Chinese restaurants will find the prices of many dishes to be high."}
{"text":"Firstly, almost as soon as we sat down the waitress brought us waters - including two with lids for the kids, yay!  Plus won-tons and that warm red sauce they serve here.  Encouraged by the start, we ordered orange beef and pad thai.  The food came out quickly and was steaming hot and surprisingly delicious.  The beef was battered, which isn't my preference, but was really good with citrus peels in the sauce and great level of spice and flavor.    One thing we just haven't gotten used to in Pittsburgh (and maybe it's an East Coast thing??) is that restaurants here tend to mash up all the \"Asian\" cuisines together and you have Chinese/Thai/Sushi (Japanese) places that just don't quite get the sometimes subtle and sometimes obvious differences.  Didn't we learn from the great Inspector Clouseau to never trust Japanese waiters bearing fortune cookies?  Ok, I digress.  Anyway, we've been burned with the combo places before but this place ROCKED THE PAD THAI!  It was hands down the best, most authentic-tasting (yes, I have been to Thailand) dish I'd had in a while.  Shocked me at how good it was!  So we had to go again. The second visit we had a larger group and the food was not quite piping hot.  We also tried the amazing chicken (still not sure what it is exactly, but it's everywhere in Western PA), and everyone agreed that the Pad Thai was great.  I'll go back for that any time.  I'm hoping that the slower service and not hot food was an anomaly, but regardless there's a dish there that calls my name.  Definitely try it."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. The only thing I don't like is that they do not have small sizes of any of the dishes. So for two or forces you to spend 25+ $$$.  Not quite common for a \"fast food\" Chinese spot. I'd expect to spend that much at a fine dining Chinese restaurant. But this isn't a restaurant. Other than that the food is good. Expect to have left overs!"}
{"text":"Tasted good but they put msg in everything! Even the soup which they say they cannot make without it. Very disappointed because it's close to where I live."}
{"text":"So sad, restaurant is closed.  No more meals at China Gate at the Galleria. Really enjoyed dinner there."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. My husband calls this place the Cheesecake Factory of Chinese food due to the portion size."}
{"text":"I've been eating at China Gate for 20 years (since well before the Cedar Center renovation). I really miss the beautiful etched glass decor and being able to eat in (as opposed to take out only), but rest assured the food is the same wonderful stuff you remember from before. Still the best hot & sour soup and mu shu pork in town, IMHO.  Props to the owners for being able to roll with such a huge transition as Cedar Center underwent!"}
{"text":"Note: Mark Pi's China Gate (or is it the other way around?) is housed inside the Mt. Lebanon mall known as The Galleria in the Mezzanine section directly above Dragonfire, a new Japanese restaurant.   With all apologies to Joe D. whose referral led us here, I was not as taken by China Gate as he was. Sparsely decorated, the open, albeit tasteful dining room somewhat reflected the unimaginative menu; there wasn't much that captured my attention. The bill of fare was so boring to me, I had trouble deciding on my entree. Eventually, I settled for the Mandarin Duck.   Made up of battered duck pieces and stir-fried in a \"brown sauce,\" it was accompanied by the usual litany of vegetables, and while it was edible and served in a hefty portion, I felt that I tasted more of the batter than I did of the proteins. It left me wanting.  Kay's Sesame Shrimp seemed to be better appointed as it was sweet, not overly battered, and carried fat portions of shellfish within each encased bite. Chunks of pineapple further accentuated the dish's sugary, sticky raison d'être.   Our appetizer in the steamed dumplings (our arbitrary Chinese starter) turned out to be a small victory as they were pleasantly doughy and adequately -- if not generously -- stuffed with dark and darkly savory ground pork.   Dessert came to us in the shape of Almond Puffs, and like the dumplings, they too were only a minor success. Never having had them before, they recalled Mexico's sopapillas or Italy's zeppole with their deep-fried golden color and powdered sugar. Inside each of these \"doughnuts\" was a sort of almond paste that nearly burned my mouth. My brush with thermal oral injury notwithstanding, I don't know if I'd order them elsewhere, their palatability  being too timid for my sweet tooth to dance with.  Our meal started with a whimper, began with a whimper, and aside from Kay's dish, didn't make much of a fuss around the middle either.   China Gate sure is a hit with the Mt. Lebanese, however. As an elderly man and fellow diner I struck up a conversation with remarked, \"I've never seen this place so busy!\" Kay and I even had difficulty finding a parking spot! Little Tokyo, also in Mt. Lebanon, is identically bustling. Hmmmph.  P.S. Is Mark Pi's China Gate a chain? Kay claims she went to one in Ohio once.   http://www.markpi.com  P.P.S. The service was patchy. Our waitress, while nice enough, kept forgetting about us and even admitted several times that she was having an \"off night.\" Out came the calculator application on my cell phone to determine a standard 15% tip in lieu of my usual 20%. Actually, I think I gave her a little more than 15%. Blame it on my Dumbo heart"}
{"text":"I ordered the hot & sour soup, vegetable fried rice, hunan shrimp and sweet and sour chicken.  All are very good, MASSIVE PORTIONS.   Very reasonable prices.  Will for sure be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Went here because our friend recommended it and of the good Yelp reviews...I'm not sure why it's rated so high. We ordered take-out: chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and sesame chicken. The food is not good. We opened the boxes at home and the sweet and sour chicken was EXACTLY the same as the sesame chicken, except you pour a different sauce on it. And the sweet and sour sauce that ended up being a congealed sweet sauce. I've had better sauce from a JAR. The chicken itself is poor quality and overly fried. Yeah, it's cheap for a lot of food, but we didn't eat it. Had a serving and ended up tossing it. I'd literally rather eat at Panda Express."}
{"text":"Substandard strip mall American Chinese. I have tried take out here twice (different days of the week, separated by about 4 months). Due to the positive reviews I gave this place a second chance. I can say that my first impression was correct. The food is very oily and has none of the wok flavor I expect from Chinese food. the proteins lacked any coloring and were not velveted. It tasted as if it were simmered in sauce. The food was packed in very cheep styrofoam containers; and the food was literally sitting in about 1 cup of sauce. They wrap the containers with plastic to prevent spilling (which is not sufficient to avoid puddles in the bottom of the bag). The sauces were watery, flavorless, and very thin. I suspect a large amount of msg in these foods. Product quality was low. Overall nearly inedible. Below are specific dish notes.   Crab Rangoon- best of the worst. Pretty standard mass produced crab Rangoon. Moderate amount of filling, primarily tasting of cream cheese. Served with a thin Apple like dipping sauce.   Lo mein- noodles very over cooked, minimal veg. Bland tasting. Highly salty/msg flavored  Kung pao chicken - primarily celery, minimal chicken. Bland, no heat. Generic brown watery sauce. Only thing reminiscent of Kung pao was the peanuts  Mongolian beef - again disappointing thin generic brown sauce. Tons of undercooked and thickly cut onion.  No spice.   In order to salvage this I attempted to strain the sauce out and sauté. Topped with Siracha. This was still not enough to to significantly improve it. I do not understand why there are usually people waiting for food there. The one plus, large amount of food per price."}
{"text":"NEVER EVER get the All-you-can-Eat. Hibachi plates are basically plates of panfried squash with a little meat that isn't even grilled. They give you nigiri sushi instead of sashimi. It's like they are trying to stuff us full of rice and squash so we fill up quickly. Also, service was unfriendly."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty stuff. We ordered a large vegetable fried rice, large general chicken, and a large beef and broccoli. We also indulged in a few vegetable egg rolls. Everything was made hot and fresh (that's a plus). Only complaint would be the small amount of beef to the ample amount of broccoli. Total order was around $30. This was take-out so I'm unsure of the dine-in experience."}
{"text":"Great food quick. Huge portions. Called our order in, I was 5 minutes early and it was ready to go.  Quick and easy.  I understand new owners took over in January of 2018.  Seamless transition from  my point of view, if anything has changed, the portions are larger and the food is delicious as always.  Hold the straw."}
{"text":"I've always loved China Gate. Good food, huge portions, friendly and always on time service. It's been one of our family go-to places for meal deals on busy evenings. But, tonight my daughter found a Plastic Zip Tie in her egg roll!! This is especially concerning, because the restaurant supposedly makes the egg rolls themselves(I've asked because of my shellfish allergies). So, WTH China Gate!? Unacceptable."}
