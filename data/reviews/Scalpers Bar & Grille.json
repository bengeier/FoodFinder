{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Lots of regulars who will make you feel right at home.Tons of tvs, great staff. Amazing made from scratch BBQ sauce. Delish homemade marinara too. Worth a visit! I recommend trying an all-in burger or if you're up to it, a Scalpers Slob. Ladies Night on Thursdays,  Live trivia on Mondays, Karaoke on Wednesdays. Djs in the basement Thursday through Saturday."}
{"text":"Scalpers may be one of the best watering holes in the eastside suburbs. Great food, awsome atmosphere, and the staff is amazing. Game days for any local team bring drink and food specials, along with multiple veiwing screens. If you want a great place to start or end your night, Scalpers is it!!"}
{"text":"great specials and atmosphere ! went on a browns Sunday great crowd and staff was helpful"}
{"text":"Frank is one of the nicest guys I have ever met.  Food is awesome and you feel like family not just a customer."}
{"text":"Do NOT be put off by the unassuming exterior. This food is delish.  We finally had their wings and they were super. Thursday is wing night at .65 each. I wish, wish, wish this place would? make their own blue cheese...it would take the wings up a notch.  Please try their food....most reasonable place in the area for food/drinks."}
{"text":"One of the city's best, local guy does good stories..frank pines and his brother Dominic along with the help of an excellent staff and family have made a reputation for themselves as IMHO the city's best local bar...look twice because it'll be disguised as a dive bar but you'll find too that as long as I've been drinking, they have been the place myself and everyone I know ends up suggesting..Scalpers is an excellent quite drink, listen to live music and play mega touch with a date place as well as a crazy drunken dancing all over their basement dance floor kinda place..for me they've been a place to meet up with my friends to pregame before going out big, as well as an end of the night place after going out hard and everything in between..I've met many a beautiful girl and many a not so beautiful in Scalpers walls, if u know what I mean..now as a responsible adult I look at Scalpers in fond memory..these days, from time to time, I've taken my fianc√© there on the way home from dinner or a night out for just one more drink or just a couple dollars worth of pop a shot basketball, it's always like cheers when we walk in..I work in the restaurant industry and with that being said they have really truly excellent food coming out of the adjoining kitchen of sharps subs..this is truly one of my favorite places"}
{"text":"This 3 star rating comes as a cumulative average of the many different trips I've been to Scalpers.  Half the times it's been a 1 & the other half it's been a 5 - It all depends on what you're looking for. 
It would be safe to say that I spend more time watching sports than the average american, so having a spot to watch multiple games on multiple TV's with not a lot of people screaming and yelling is valuable to me - Scalper's is that spot.  For Monday Night Football games, this is tops on my list:  the beer is incredibly cheap (~$2.00 for 22 oz nearly everytime I've been there), the bar-tenders are all pretty cool & have a knowledge & interest in the games, they have Keno, darts & I've even seen corn-hole played in the back.  Sounds like a 5 star, right...?
Here is a list of the 1 star qualities.  I have never ordered food & probably will continue to stay away from the kitchen.  I'm not an expert on the anatomy of fruit flies, but they probably shouldn't be living when the temperature is below 0, yet Scalper's does a good job of hosting them... in the bar area.  If they're in the bar area, you can only imagine they're in the food area as well.
The social scene is not something I want to be a part of.  Cheap beer & other drinks attract all kinds of folks & it tends to get quite busy & potentially rowdy on Friday & Saturday night.  I've seen some great costumes during a halloween party there - I've seen some equally great costumes 3 months later.  To conclude the social atmosphere portion of this review, The Plain Dealer ran a great story about Scalpers a few days into 2011 - complete with the number of people involved in the fight as well as the the total damages done.
Long story short, if you're looking for a low-key spot to enjoy a few cold inexpensive beers, this is a great spot.  If you're looking for anything else, I would steer clear."}
{"text":"Say you want to catch a Cleveland Sports game. Go to Scalpers. Say you want to drink some whiskey. Go to Scalpers. Say you like to dance and drink cheap drinks. GO TO SCALPERS. Delicious food, excellent Happy Hour prices, and Ohio sports on over a dozen TVs. Come get some, just don't be a D about it."}
{"text":"Great food awesome staff!! Really good happy hour and the whole place is super clean!! Nothin to complain about here!"}
{"text":"I've gotten their wings for parties and they're always a big hit. I would highly recommend for this."}
{"text":"An average dive bar. The food is out pretty quick and priced quite reasonable: I've had their cold-cut sandwiches (they have quite a few subs) twice (no more than $8-9) which was still open when we arrived at after 9 on weekday nights. 

There's a bunch of old men in here, and honestly, this place was much more blue collar than I expected. 

It's an interesting set-up, there's a narrow walkway in the front next to the bar which leads to a small back area with booths and chairs that you can rearrange with with a handful of TVs. Overall, the seating is small, no more than 15-20 in this back area. 

Their tap selection is average dive bar, 5-8 taps with the domestics and a Shandy. They had Deschutes on tap once, I was shocked, although something was wrong with the tap and the bartender didn't know how to fix it and shrugged. 

I'm in a frisbee rec league nearby and although the bartenders were friendly, they weren't always the most responsive and lack of seats in the back lead us to find other pastures after a couple visits. 

For other distractions, they're also a mini bowling alley."}
{"text":"I'm being told that there is now an expanded menu that merits checking out.  Unfortunately I live out of state but after asking some old friends from the area, the food is pretty good.  For this and my trust in others (stink in basement is improved), I've bumped my rating up to 4 stars.  See you next time I come to Cleveland."}
{"text":"We had driven back from North Carolina. After spending all day driving, we arrived around 1AM. Scalpers was the only place where the kitchen was still open. The food was good, really cheap, and the people singing karaoke in the back were hilarious. Definitely what we needed after the long day."}
{"text":"Dive bar , bathrooms were dirty and place needs a good scrubbing.
Talent behind bar were not very good bartenders maybe better uber drivers ..
Weak Drinks..
Dogs have fleas here so does the bar.."}
{"text":"Easily the best wings I've ever had! Dom let us know that they'd be crispy af and they were. I had a mix of garlic parm and cajun ones. Dairy Queen is across the road so get a sundae if you're worried about the cajun ones making your pooper sting."}
{"text":"I love this place. Not only do they have Belly but their bartenders are amazing. Its a great place to go and watch your favorite team as they have a lot of large screen televisions. I like to come here and play darts. I'm a server so I usually come here around 12-1. Its pretty busy around these times most days but its a great dove bar to go to."}
{"text":"I usually like the Ohio City bars but my BF prefers the divey places like this one. I actually like this place though. Ordered a grilled chicken salad for $4.95, comes with choice of two dressings and decent amount of foliage. Draft beers are pretty cheap too. Seems like there are a lot of regulars here. Easy parking (has it own lot). Bartenders are real nice and easy to talk to."}
