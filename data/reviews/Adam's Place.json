{"text":"My boyfriend and i go out for breakfast every saturday. we went here for the first time ever a few weeks ago and have been back every week since. The food is so good and the service has been excellent also. The greek omlet, homefries and blueberry pancakes are awesome. I have also been told the gyros are good too."}
{"text":"I had to post an update. This place just SUCKS!!! The food is good for sure but the wait staff and management are CLUELESS!!!!!!!!!!!!! They need someone there who can whip it into shape badly. Coffee still sucks worse than ever...."}
{"text":"I went back here today to pick up a couple of takeout orders and was left dissatisfied. It was only after i returned home that I noticed they screwed up the order (they didn't forget to charge me extra for what they neglected to add tho). I would have taken it back if the place hadn't closed 5minutes after I walked out the door. :/"}
{"text":"I've been a fan since before I could walk. The servers used to slip us free donuts when no one was looking just because we were cute. I don't know that I've ever been here for anything other than breakfast and I have no complaints. Diner food at its best served hot and fast. It's a bit of a tight squeeze on the weekends when crowded though."}
{"text":"Adam's Place is near my home so I go there frequently for breakfast.  They have great breakfast specials that are extremely reasonably priced!  The hash browns are theeeee best. The service is top notch and the food is always prepared quickly."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was little and always get their breakfast; it's amazing, especially for the price. The wait staff has always been welcoming and friendly, and Adams is always our go-to place when my family gets together. Definitely give it a try if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Adams place was such a great place for breakfast on the way to Geneva for the weekend. The waitress went out of her way to serve us well. I had requested pancakes instead of hashbrowns with my omelet.  When the pancake arrived I realized I had forgotten to say blueberry pancakes. I asked for a blueberries on the side and then the waitress insisted on making a new blueberry pancake for me.  I told her no-no that's not necessary and that's unreasonable as I didn't even tell you I'd like a blueberry pancake.  She insisted and I simply said thank you so much.  The omelet and pancakes we're amazing. Adams is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and cute little place for a quick bite. Food was okay and service was quick. It is cash only."}
{"text":"Argie - the owner - is the Hostess with the Mostest! She does a super jogb here. Food is always good, service friendly, and the prices can't be beat. Home cooking at its best. The soups are FROM SCRATCH, and always excellent. Try the flavored iced teas."}
{"text":"If I wanna fill my stomach for the start of a new day, I like to go to Adam's Place for a Big Bite! Half savory with the eggs, bacon, and sausage and half sweet with two giant pancakes!"}
{"text":"This place is way under rated. The service is wonderful and the breakfast food is delicious and very cheap!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for breakfast today with some friends.  I don't know anyone personally who has been here, so aside from what I heard on Yelp I didn't know anything about it.  We got there about 11am and the small parking lot was full.  There are side streets you can park on though.  We walked in and it was self seating. There were tables available so there was no waiting.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  Everything in the menu sounded great. I was stuck between the chicken and waffles and an omelette so I got neither. I ordered Adams Loaded Homefries, which was potatoes topped with eggs peppers and onions and sausage gravy. It came with a biscuit and I ordered a side of bacon.  AWESOME! My friend had steak and eggs with a side of sausage, grits, and toast. My other friend had a waffle with eggs and bacon.  We all enjoyed our food.  They brought it out steaming hot! The wait for it was not long at all.  I will be going back to try other menu items. It's in the neighborhood. It's a good family place.  The wait staff is friendly.  So far I love it!"}
{"text":"Great Food!! Great Service.. Home Fries are amazing!! Had Lunch and was in and out in 20minutes.. Would definately recommend to anyone in the Euclid/Cleveland area."}
