{"text":"Super découverte!!  Plats savoureux au goût du Pérou.  Spécial du lundi et mardi: 29$ pour 3 services.  

C'est un resto apportez votre vin."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in my top three Latin fusion cuisine in US & Canada. The price was right for the food. Service was great!"}
{"text":"The best octopus I never had! Is is a small quiet place, but the service is attentive, and the food is very well prepared. It a nice touch to to bring your own wine. The menu choice is rather limited, but the 5 of use all truly our food; the latino accents bring a refreshing touch of sun!. The price is very decent. The only downside was that there was only one dessert choice on the night we were there."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the fresh bread and entrees. Main dishes were good but the octopus tasted reheated."}
{"text":"Le personnel est très sympathique, mais la nourriture manquait de saveur. Le rapport qualité/prix n'y est tout simplement pas."}
