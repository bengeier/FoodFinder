{"text":"The kitchen is wonderful but go on the weekend, sit at the bar. Dan, likely the best bartender in the city, could not be more fun."}
{"text":"First time here the menu is selection with daily specials and decent selection of beer. Definitely something on the menu for everyone and have brunch on weekends. The pizza was very good and the server was very nice! Jenga while you wait was fun !"}
{"text":"Worst food ever , went for lunch and wait staff was rude and apparently the owner doesn't care much for clients either since I found a hair in my pasta and they didn't even offer to remake it ! Never again  and I will be telling everyone I know !!!"}
{"text":"I've passed this place a few times in the evening and it always looks very busy. I was passing by this afternoon my boyfriend and I decided to go in for lunch.   The bar selection was reasonable. They had several beers that I imagine would cater to a variety of different groups. They also had a fairly large selection of liquor, including a few \"top shelf\" bottles, including my favourite gin, Hendrick's. I ended up having a pint of Barking Squirrel, for nostalgic reasons.   Despite the well-stocked bar and name, the food was far from super. The menu boasts several stone fired pizza options, so naturally I opted for the classico calzone, which consisted of tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and a selection of herbs. The crust of the calzone was nothing special, but was at least palatable. The tomato sauce, however, had the consistency and appearance of a thin tomato soup, and the flavour was inline with what you might expect from a can of Campbell's, at best.   My boyfriend had the chicken club sandwich, served with fries. Presentation wise the sandwich looked great. But unfortunately the chicken was dry, dry, dry. Not even the watery sauce from my botched calzone could save this sammy.   Overall, this place is fine for a drink at the bar while watching one of the numerous TVs positioned throughout the restaurant, but I would not recommend it a lunch or dinner spot."}
{"text":"I don't expect wait staff to automatically hop to attention when I enter their establishment, but this place is something else.  I live nearby, so I've often compromised my principles and returned, for the convenience, but certainly not the service.  One night, when the place was utterly barren, I was refused seating near the windows (I wanted to read) and was told I had to sit in one of the dark, tiny two-seater booths (I was alone--BAD idea in the King/Bathurst area).  When I insisted on the window so I could read (every other table was empty), I was still refused. So I left, and they were fine with that. Well, I've gone back a few times (I live minutes away, remember?) and each visit's been a trying experience, I'll tell you.  If you're a guy or gal on your own, don't even bother--you'll sit there 10-15 minutes before someone even acknowledges your existence.  I walked out tonight and they were seemingly fine with that. Too bad--the menu doesn't change much but the food is good, drink selection more than fine, and the decor (an old bank) spacious and otherwise pleasant. Too bad about the service...or utter lack of..."}
{"text":"Eat here on a regular basis, Im from the neghborhood.   Steak is great actually the food is REALLY good here and surprising.   Plenty of beers to choose from, great place will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great place to catch the game. Bar staff are incredibly funny and attentive. Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Not amazing but also not crappy. It's a good place to get great drinks and pub food. Walking distance from the action and the patio is fun to sit at and watch the people float along."}
{"text":"Nice vibe and the food we had was good - something for everyone. I had salmon (perfectly cooked); others had the prime rib special, chicken sandwich and margarita pizza. Service was friendly. Seems like a great local spot."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, the location is perfect right at King and Bathurst. The food was served fast and everything tasted great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a 2 minute walk for me, so I wish it was better. It's okay for a couple of pints, but the quality of food and drinks isn't too high. I'll still go, but I know what to expect."}
{"text":"Large, traditional pub in a crowded corner King and Bathurst. Different seating available, like small tables, large ones, and a square bar that I really enjoy. It's good to have that diversity depending on how you're joing the pub.  The place is a large, square room with high ceilings, some small and big screens, always nice for events. It makes everyone standing more or less together in that large room.  Beer choice is ok, mostly big names on tap, fancier ones in bottle/cans. No problem noticed with service, which meets expectations."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, both the four season and the ham and mushroom.  Came back a couple days later for the mussel special.  Rustic atmosphere, very comfortable."}
{"text":"Zero Stars if I could. Really disappointing way to start our vacation.  Attempted to grab a drink here while visiting Toronto with my boyfriend.  As soon as we stepped inside the front door the guy checking ID's said \"they were too full.\"  I looked around and there was barely anyone inside...I thought it was weird, but we turned around and left.  It only later dawned on me after my boyfriend said, \"that happens a lot.\"  That they denied us entering because he is mixed race.    Don't go here if you're not white, apparently!   We were dressed up very nicely and are both models... it was exclusively about his skin color unfortunately."}
{"text":"Looks promising from the outside.  But was largely disappointed by the overall experience.  Beer was good and cold - best thing about the night.   Got the nachos since they were on special.  Bland at best - even with the jalapenos. Little flavor. That was followed by probably the worst Caesar salad I've had (wasn't sure if it was just lettuce and cheese without dressing).  And I tried the french onion soup which was at best average.  Service was OK (a little slow, but he was nice enough).  Beer was cold.  And good beer selection.  But doubtful I make it back there.  Plenty of other pubs to try out nearby.  Which is too bad, I was expecting better. I probably should have read the other reviews first..."}
{"text":"A great little escape in the King West neighbourhood, the Banknote serves standard but delicious pub food. The main reason I keep coming back is the service. I will just sum it up to say every single employee I've encountered there has provided my friends and I with friendly and attentive service, especially Meghan, who goes out of her way to ensure we are taken care of.   My go-to is the Antipasto plate but the menu is broad and there is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I now LOVE this place.   Went here a while ago with friends. I've always sort of wanted to go inside because I like old buildings etc. and we were out wandering in that neighbourhood and decided to give it a shot. The ambiance didnt disappoint. Cozy and casual.   I'll echo the comment that the food was quite good for pub grub. Four of us split a plate of nachos and there was enough to go around. Everything seemed pretty reasonably priced for downtown. The service was not spectacularly fast, but they were friendly and obliging. I forget what night of the week it was, but they had a live band in that evening. I enjoy live music, and it was mostly covers of songs that we all knew, so it was a welcome addition to the festivities.   All in all, it was a nice place to go for a beer with some friends, away from the pretence that literally hangs in the air in that part of town. Generally positive experience. I would go back.  Here's what took them to 5-star rating: When I got home later that night, I noticed one of my (real) earrings had fallen out. After crying my eyes out, I called the bar (after close, no less) to see if they had found anything. It was a shot in the dark. The sympathetic fellow on the phone took a look, and told me to try back in a couple days, after the cleaners had gone through. I was just ILL about it for days. When I did call back, after describing the earring over the phone, I was informed that they did have it, and I picked it up that evening. I know its kind of a pain and they didnt have to help me or even be nice, but the staff were so great. Amazing kindness and honesty. I was just floored. Thanks again :)"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a brunch attempt. My Friend and I are the only customers and our order still came out wrong. I ordered eggs benny with a side of bacon and was brought poached eggs on brown toast :/ Uhm No! My Friend ordered over easy with sausage and her eggs were hard. So disappointed. Unfortunately having this place right across from me is of no advantage."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place. Good service. Amazing brunch menu on weekends and $10 mimosa for 2-3 glasses."}
{"text":"On Monday Banknote has 8$ pasta night. The lasagna never disappoints and the servers are very friendly."}
{"text":"My third star is just for my server: Julianna She was the shining star between all the chaos. Always smiling!  This place is packed with people coming after work to hangout with colleagues and yes I was of the same crowd. We came here for a co-workers farewell and its a great place to gather. The food however was very average, nothing awesome and the cocktails were so bad. I had a Malibu Stacy and it was baaaad. Next came the Long Island Ice tea and this was ok.  For food we had just ordered a bunch of appetizers so my review is based solely on that, we had the chips with dips (two salsa's and some guac), bruschetta (good), onion rings (ok.. it's onion rings, what do you expect?), antipasto plate(yum!) and fried calamari.   Overall this place was just like many other bars I have been too, if you wanna just hangout without spending too much money then its a good place. Stick to beer though, this place isn't for cocktails."}
{"text":"I really like this place, I've been here a few times since moving into the city and i have to say i haven't been disappointed any of the times i have been here.  I've come by after work to have a drink with a friend and the service was quick, friendly and timely - she always came back right in time to ask if we needed or wanted anything more.  my most recent visit there was a little odd - but still not odd enough to turn me off from the place. I asked for a vodka soda, and my friend asked for glass of white, we got served the wrong drinks! I got a gin and tonic brought to me and she got a glass of red... worse part about it is, she wrote it down!  its a nice bar to pop into, haven't had the opportunity to eat there yet, but definitely will try it one day!"}
{"text":"First bar I visited when I first arrived in Toronto and I'm still going there. Servers are nice and the regulars are super friendly.  They have a decent selection of beers, without having too many. You should look out for their specials on Monday ($7 pasta), Tuesday (Mussels) and Wednesday (half priced wings).   I'm a burger enthusiast and was very pleasantly surprised when I ordered their Classic Burger. It was delicious. French fries are standard.  I'm using this bar as my go to place whenever I go out. People might say it serves a somewhat older / tourist-y audience, but I can't say that's true."}
{"text":"considering that its a pub I was extremely impressed with the food....I walked in the door and almost walked out. it seemed like such a dive bar. we were the only people in the restaurant. Our server killed time eating and playing on her phone... i cant blame her though I would be extremely bored too. I usually get eggs Benedict but decided against that for fear of disappointment, so I went with french toast. When ordering the french toast I asked our server how it was...her response\" ya its actually not bad\"... I was terrified. I thought that I was going to get the worst french toast. When it was served I was extremely pleasantly surprised, it was amazing and the presentation was fabulous"}
{"text":"The sign on the window says, 'Since 1999' and any bar still in business since then must be doing something (or everything!) right. In the entertainment district an unpretentious bar with high ceilings and inviting expansive doorway and period architecture location is everything and Banknote has the corner spot with a fantastic view overlooking a busy and colorful corner that is King and Bathurst. Behind is a buzzing Hoxton nightclub and across Bathurst is the venerable Wheat Sheaf. We picked a table right by the corner window with it's incredibly refreshing casement windows popped open inviting a breeze into the bar, so lovely! We were served promptly even as I noticed the staff clumped together chatting and seeming to enjoy their work night. I'm always impressed when staff can rattle off their beer selection and I could listen to that over and over. Some good crafts on tap here and bottle selections are posted at the back high up on a chalkboard. We split a pizza which had tasty seafood toppings and arrived quickly at our table complimenting the beers nicely. There was a medium sized crowd that Saturday night during TIFF giving the bar an airy feeling without feeling dead and quiet. Highly recommended as a casual stopover before a night of clubbing or possibly an afterwork spot to enjoy one of their long running specials like the mussels :) Live music on a Sat. night was great too."}
{"text":"The setup is kinda nice and reminds me if my other fav pub (Irish Embassy).  The place started to fill up 5 ish as it was a Friday. I just wanted a beer so I sat at the bar. they have a somewhat decent beer selection for draft beers. Leffe Blonde was my choice it was brought out nicely in the signature Leffe glass.  There seems to be a lot of regulars here as the bar tender seemed to know most of them. The prices are a bit on the higher side.  I can't comment much about the food as I didn't have any. Service was OK as I was checked on regularly by the bartender. I wouldn't mind coming here if I am in the area.  They had CP24 and a sports channel on so one can pass time if that's needed."}
{"text":"Nice new find last night in this neighbs. Definitely most chill spot and great for a fun casual hang out  with a group of friends. Drink specials are very good deals and there have a nice variety of beers on tap. Service was very friendly and fast even on a busy night. Solid place. Will return."}
{"text":"Overall somewhat disappointing food, even for a pub. It's partially saved by the great beer selection.   I've found the service to be hit or miss but mostly decent. Oh, and I should have realized before I sat down but that is one loud corner with the street car running over various tracks there.  Don't go here expecting great food and you'll probably enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"I was very happy to come here again.  Food was really good this time, especially the specials.  We got   2 lbs of mussels in white wine sauce and a pint of Stella, for only $15!  It was such a good deal!  Moreover, the sauce was yummy!  We also ordered calamari.  The chipotle mayo was perfect for me.  I enjoyed it.  Shrimp scampi linguini with white wine was ok but Fettuccini Alfredo we had last time was better.   The sever was very nice.  Thank you for serving us.  We enjoyed talking to you.  We will come back again for sure.  I really wanna try other food like mussels in tomato sauce, lasagna, fish & chip ^____^  It's a good spot for hang-out with my husband and friends.  Just only one thing keep bothering me, is the cleanliness of lady washrooms.  Hope you guys can do something about it.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great service (of course being Canadians) great range of craft beers. Good tunes.. However day time was quiet though, which was nice in my opinion. I had the $7 mussels. Hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Not super busy so we were seated quick. Hostess and server were both very pleasant and accommodating. Atmosphere is dark while being warm and inviting. Lots of wood everywhere. One big open room.   I ordered a Negroni that I swapped out for an Amaretto Sour, my friend ordered a Pinot. Drinks were fine.   Ordered poutine as an app which were okay. Not good enough that I'd recommend... Nachos were half price so I thought I'd try some. They skimp on toppings and it's not a large portion, I would have been upset if I had paid full price ($15) for it. $2 for an extra ramekin of sour cream... Get over yourself, Banknote.  My friend ordered the chicken parm with fries (fries were bland, sandwich was good).   Service was better than the food. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"For pub food I was pleasantly surprised. The steak here was cooked perfectly, and had lots of flavour. I ordered the Little Taste of Italy sandwich. The sirloin steak was tender and juicy. They give you a decent sized steak on a bun. The hot peppers on the steak gave the sandwich a nice spicy kick. I had been craving meat the whole day and this fulfilled my wish. My only complaint would be that the bun was soaked in oil, which made it too greasy. I enjoyed the fries; they were the thicker ones which I prefer. I also tried the seafood shrimp linguine, which while good also had too much oil for my liking.   The service here was okay, but could have been better. We did have to wave down the waitress a couple to times to get her attention. The special for the day was $3 Budweiser bottles, which is really cheap.   If you are looking for something in the neighbourhood with decent food and a variety of beer and drinks I would come here."}
{"text":"I just had the grilled salmon with salad and it was very good.  I think the cook could ease off on the balsamic but the salmon was very good.   The green beans were also delicious and cooked perfect.  The server also forgot to put the balsamic on the side which she even suggested because I told her I was on a diet. But I enjoyed it so much I didn't mention it.  But my mouth does taste like balsamic vinegar! Oy. Overall I thought it was a good pub.  The food presentation was excellent.   It was a nice atmosphere and a very good location! The server was also excellent and worked well with my requests.  Good experience.  Will go back.  Ahhh... sad diet man."}
{"text":"Was at the Banknote last weekend as it has been a favorite of a friends for years now.  He has a particular affinity for the Breakfast Pizza Club, which when first hearing of said pizza, sounded less than appealing as a breakfast/brunch offering, BUT the Banknote's Breakfast Pizza Club @$12 is well worth carb- loading in the early AM or mid-afternoon for.  Absolute perfection for those nursing \"headaches\" from the night before.  The BPC is essentially just pizza with scrambled egg, but in actuality it is so much more.   I have also enjoyed the \"Hangover Bacon & Egg Cheeseburger,\" yes that's actually what it's called, and the namesake does not disappoint.  With spicy fully-loaded $5 ceasers and pints before 3pm this place is an absolute must."}
{"text":"The Bank Note is equivalent to our Cheers!   Love this place - especially for Jay's Games!"}
{"text":"Came here with coworkers on a weekday. It's a convenient bar tucked away on the east end of Adelaide. There's not much around it.   Service was good and they have a decent selection of beers on tap, but their food was weak. I've give them 3.5 stars if I could. We tried a bunch of appetizers and the only decent one were the tacos which were a good portion. Everything else was just meh. Eg pizza was too salty, calamari was under cooked, nachos were basic  I would come only for drinks.  PS that  is a mission"}
{"text":"We were bar hoping, and we ran into this place. It has a convenient location, and it wasn't crowded.  I liked the concept; the fact that the place was a bank; the variety of cocktails; the everyday deals; and that I saw all kind of people.  Some of the youngest groups were playing jenga. They were also some mature couples, close to the bar, dancing on the seats while drinking shots. Some guys were watching sports, eating, and drinking beer.  We didn't order food. But I gave the place 4 stars, because I love eclectic places in where you can do what you want.  The chocolate martini and the mojitos where really tasty.  I'll be back to try one of they special offers. $10 burger and beer all day, everyday; $7 pasta on Mondays; $5 shot of Jagger, on weekends; The Benny eggs for brunch."}
{"text":"We live almost right next to this place and this our go-to when we feel like going out for breakfast. Its a hidden gem! Great portions, tasty food and a great price at 8 bucks!"}
{"text":"came back here a second time and the food quality was better as well as the service. the fish and chips were great. price wise menu is a little steep but i was impressed with the quality and taste of fish and chips"}
{"text":"This is a great spot! Went for brunch on Sunday and had a great experience. The steak and eggs - perfect. Service was great and the atmosphere is fun and casual. lots of beer choices on tap and some great drink specials - Didn't have one but the $5 Caesar looked great! Also lots of Tv's so a great place to watch a game. I will definitely head back for dinner."}
{"text":"This review is strictly about Banknote's martinis.    On the whole, I think Banknote is a fine pub and probably one of the better ones in its area.  The Wheat Sheaf (across the street) is more ideal for a pint-and-wings-night, blue-collar-with-a-hint-of-taste experience, where Banknote makes for a fine pub when you're out for a business lunch or some other dressier occasion.  Portions are sometimes low, but their food is normally very good.  However, my recent experience to enjoy some martinis left me disappointed.  Bartender Dan is a knowledgeable, classy, entertaining fellow with an insight into what's good and enjoyable, so I have to believe that it's the owners who keep one of Dan's hands tied around his back.   Gordon's is the gin of choice when you order a standard gin martini, and to my palate, Gordon's is like drinking medicine.  Over the months, I've also noticed that the sizes of their martinis have been gradually decreasing.  That seems to be even more the case should you order with a higher-end gin, such as Hendrick's, which barely filled half my glass (yes, olives included).  For the price, Banknote simply isn't giving you your money's worth when it comes to martinis.  But don't blame Dan."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. The place was pretty dead and it took 35 minutes to get my food! A calzone and a Cesar salad. Horrible croutons on my salad, the calzone was sooo gross it wasn't fully cooked inside and was really doughy, I couldn't eat it! My friend had fries and a sandwich, the bread wasn't toasted so it was super soggy from the meats they had put on it and the fries tasted like McCain shoe string. Great place I'm sure if you are coming to drink but for eating - I'll pass."}
{"text":"I've somehow managed to find my way to banknote three weeks in a row now and every time I've been a little disappointed. As for location, it's in a great spot and it's got tons of space if you have a big group coming in. The whole notion of the pub is pretty interesting with the safe door still being there and it's nice, clean place to have a drink. They also have live jazz music on Friday nights but that's pretty much where it ends.  The food is one of the worst pub foods I've had (one bite chicken wings anyone? tasteless nachos?) but I give them brownie points for having Weihenstephan. On the other hand they don't do pitchers (god knows why when they have all this space and they know big groups are going to be coming in) so it's a bit of a let down.  Prices are decent and the washrooms clean but hopefully I can make this my final week of ending up here and head over to many of the better options on King street instead."}
{"text":"I only had drinks here so I can't comment much on the food. It is a typical pub. It is a great spot if you want something casual in the area. The atmosphere is casual and it is often loud.  The pub don't have anything unique about it, but I give it a four stars because the servers are always friendly and welcoming here. The next time you want to stop in a pub to catch a game or go for drinks with friends/colleagues, consider Banknote!"}
{"text":"The bank note is a decent pub, and is a good option for some drinks and pub food.  The food is not great, but its not bad. They offer half-price app's on wednesdays, and that is their best deal.  I like to sit at the bar here, mainly because of its shape, and old-school feel.  It is a good place to meet someone for a date, or even just going for a few pints with a friend or two.  Last time I was here, which was just last week, the bartender, dan, was very friendly, and helpful with food and drink recommendations.    I give it 3 stars as I really feel it could be alot better. It is in a great location to take the opportunity of being the best pub in its neighbourhood. The service was 4 stars, and the ambience was 4 stars.  However, the food and lost potential bring back down to 3 stars.  slainte"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim as the GF was starving after trying to find a place to eat in the distillery neighborhood. She was craving steak and it was her B-day so who am i to argue.  So after a bit of skepticism, the barkeep said the steak would be great, So the NY Strip was ordered.  Well it was cooked a perfect medium rare.  The  cooked spinach side  was fantastic, just that right blend of olive oil, garlic and salt.   The barkeep  was right.  Nice steak!"}
{"text":"Despite the so-so reviews for this pub, I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 for my one-time visit on a Sunday night, no less.  I used to live in London (Jolly Old, not Ontario) and love pubs that remind me of some of the haunts I used to frequent across the pond. They have weekly night specials, Sundays happen to be martinis, and I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, clientelle and staff alike. I also ordered a pizza which was absolutely rocking! I'd even go back just to try a few other pizzas out, actually.  Anyways because this place is so close to home for me, this is going to become a regular of mine."}
{"text":"Bank Note is interesting in that the gimmick of it being a former bank is used sparingly.  They retain the safe door at the back of the restaurant and have teller windows that separate the booths, but that's it. Thankfully we don't have to deal with menu items like the \"Big Deposit Burger\" or the \"Appetisers of High Interest\".  It begins and ends there.  It's a decent place for drinks and nightly dinner specials.  (all-you-can-eat pasta, mussels, half-price apps all depending upon the night).  It purports to be a 'Supergrill', strong claim, and there is some good food to be had.  On Blue Jays game days, they have a baseball special which is a steak supper and a beer for $20.  They've got one of the tastier calzones that you'll have outside of Little Italy, and their ribs are surprisingly good.  Not an expectation for a pub of this nature.  I would suggest that you avoid brunches unless you like scrambled eggs only.  It appears they use ready-made whipped eggs or similar product, so a sunny-side up option (my brunch go-to) will not be found here."}
{"text":"Pretty limited experience at this pub at the corner of King and Bathurst, but each time has been very good.  I used to work just up the street from here so if we finished early enough, myself and my co-workers would swing by for a cold beer or two before last call. Beer prices were good and the taps clean, which is a plus.  As for the food, I've had the burger, wings and pasta, and all were very good. I was especially impressed with the pasta (they have pasta night on Tuesdays, and I believe it's $5 a dish for either spaghetti with meatballs, lasagna or fettuccini with wine sauce). For such a good price and given that it's pub and not a pasta place, the quality is impressive.  The owner and staff are all very friendly. Prices are good. I believe they also have a burger special on one of the weekdays as well.   Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch sport or just hang out. Good food and service and Heather's hair is amazing tonight!"}
{"text":"Came here Thursday night after work at 8PM with a group of nine people.  The place is very dimmed with a loud background.  It was a bit difficult to hear one another without screaming.    Daily specials noted in the menu.  I ordered the Thursday special; $5 Labatt 50 and $12 blue plate (wings, ribs, fries).  The wings were a bit soggy and salty, ribs and fries tasted great.  Can't go wrong with a $5 pint."}
{"text":"Never had a bad time here and I go regularily . Has a great special almost everynight of the week. There is always a $5 pint to be had . Friendly accomodating staff. Everyday there is a burger and a half pint for $10. Its one of the best burgers I've ever had ."}
{"text":"Food was great . Service was even better! Great place to watch a game! Beers tasted great ! Interesting clientele!"}
{"text":"Menu recently changed , not the same anymore . Used to be great bar . A lot has changed . Thinking of another spot to drink and eat at nights ."}
{"text":"Super excited to have a new local bar in the area! Around the Corktown area, there are a fair share of restaurants on King East and if you head west towards St. Lawrence area. But Adelaide East was lacking in restaurants and bars, and kind of a dead town in the evenings. When I saw Banknote was replacing the old (not so great pub) I was looking forward to the opening. I haven't been to the other Banknote in King West area but it seems a few of my friends were familiar with it.   First noticed the Banknote in the Summer, with their patio packed with people having a drink outside. The patio is a great size, lots of good sized tables for large groups.   When I arrived, I noticed their entrance is where the patio is, on Ontario St. However when you walk in, it seems a little confusing because they have their computer system to the right of there. I got seated quickly by their hostess.   Good selection of beers on tap, quite a big menu. Lots of selection, makes it harder to make a decision. I went with the Meatball Sandwich which was amazingly good. Came with a side salad. And my guy got the Chicken Club with fries. Can't go wrong with the chicken club but he found that the bread made the sandwich seem dry, I thought it was fine since the chicken was flavourful.   Overall, I had a great experience there and will be back since it's my official local bar close to home."}
{"text":"Great drink specials. I recommend this spot to grab drinks with friends. Laid back ambiance. Perfect place to go after work. Great location downtown near clubs and other bars."}
{"text":"Went there with coworkers for lunch.  There were 15 of us in the restaurant.   Pros: + spacious restaurant.   Great for large groups + decently priced  Cons: - portion sizes between different meals very inconsistent.   Food: (4/5 stars) I ordered veal picatta, it was quite smaller than i expected, but was just enough food.  (If i was more hungry, I would have been disappointed). The meal was a bit sour, otherwise good.  (3.5/5 stars) A few coworkers ordered chicken parmigana and hadock and chips. They were very satisfied with it.  Service: Good, they set the tables up for all of us.  The waitress did some recommendations and they paned out. Did not interact enough to give a more detailed review.    Ambiance (5 stars) Great for lunch for large groups.   Looked like a place that would be good to watch a sports game.  Very spacious.    In conclusion  good for large team lunches and for watching sporting events."}
{"text":"This place wins the award for the worst fish n chips I've ever had. This was years ago, so maybe they have their act together now... But the piece of fish they gave me was the tiniest piece I had ever seen in my life. (maybe the size of a few thick cut french fries) I essentially paid 10 dollars for a plate of fries. I think they might have run out of fish in the back? Either way, the food is not the greatest... and there is a ton of other options in the neighbourhood I'd rather go to. Big Smoke, Coco Rice, The One That Got Away...  If I was the kind of person to send something back I would have. But I am the kind of person that just never returns."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 4 star rating based 60/40 on the Thursday night $5 pints (and not limited to the crap domestic beers like Canadian and Coors like most places - thumbs up for that)  the Saturday night $5 glasses of wine, and the ambiance - I'm a nerd and like old architecture, so the fact that it's the inside of an old bank is pretty neat.  It's a cozy place, relatively good service, and there's some live music going on on the weekends. I don't understand people who have called this place \"a dive\". Not sure what establishments you usually frequent, but dive this is not. It's nicely furnished and clean. I only ate there once and the food was alright, but I really wouldn't recommend it as a spot to plan to eat a meal. Really just a perfect place to go for cheap drinks with your good company."}
{"text":"We had supper at the Banknote Bar this evening.  Gord and Shawna both ordered Southern Fried Chicken.  They said it was delicious and would get it again.  Maybe I'll get it next time!  I had Prime Rib (with no veggies and extra mashed potatoes).  It was good ... definitely a Sunday meal.  The potatoes were just like I'd make at home.  Yum!  Mackenzie was our server and she took good care of us."}
{"text":"The Banknote has been very kind to our group of Aston Villa Supporters since we moved from another establishment.  They have been great to open a bit early for us to get the TV's on and the game going. Really enjoy the brunch on weekends, very good price for the neighborhood. Great selection on tap, including some great ciders!"}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch on a Monday, it was really empty.  Ordered the *TOMAHAWK CHOP* (basically their biggest steak), it wasn't bad. I prefer my steaks a bit thicker though.  The area around the bathroom really stinks."}
{"text":"Loud and decent bar. A diversity of young and old come to this bar. A neighborhood spot for those local and in search of a little less in the club district."}
{"text":"I've been here a good number of times. It's a nice low key bar in king west to just chill grab a bite and have a few drinks. The servers are friendly and quick (minus one instance where we had ask a few times to get our drink). It has a few screens for watching sports but I wouldn't consider this a sports bar.   There plenty of seating, the drinks are well priced with daily specials and there are lots of food options. The Margarita pizza and salmon main entry are also surprisingly good for a bar."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday night.  Service was alright, had the steak frites and was very pleased with it.  Pub ambiance, very cozy."}
{"text":"Banknote is a cute bar on King Street West (also a location on adelaife) serving up a huge selection of drinks and bar food. I hesitate to call it br foid because it's definitely a few notches up. Very reasonably priced and super cute decor.  I would suggest it for a night out with friends, a casual date, and definitely after work drinks. The space is large with tons of seating and you don't feel crowded at all.  We had the brunch because we were in before 3pm...with drinks our bill came to 38 $....cha ching! Not sacrificing many of my hard earned dollars :) The food was delicious and made fresh to order.  Now the bad.... Not sure if this is standard or if they were short staffed but oh my God...it took almost 30 minutes for the food to arrive!! The server just walked by and kept saying it was coming but a family who came in after us was served before us. No apology or adjustment to bill...come on!  I'll try the Adelaide location but I'm weary to go back to this one on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Pretty standard in every way. Standard beer, standard bar food BUT they do have jenga sets that you can play with at your table?  That's about it."}
{"text":"The bartender made a standard trip to the bar an extraordinary experience. Unfortunately my friend and I cannot recall his name, but he was friendly (a man that wore glasses to prevent being punched by unruly patrons) and provided advice that I'll carry with me forever. Though I'm from New York, I'll always remember the fashion district because of him. And of course, the drinks were A1! Give him a raise!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times as it is next to my office.  The food is a average and the service is good however if you come here for lunch DO NOT BOTHER it will take you about an hour before your food arrives.  I think they have only one person in the kitchen.    Good news is they paid for my beer yet again as the wait was too long.  Ended up taking the food back to the office after waiting an hour for a club sandwich while the restaurant was only at a third of its capacity.   Last time I will be dining at banknote :("}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday and got wasted  had the $10 pizza (6.2 outta 10) one bite everyone knows the rules...  $3 bottles of bud were perfect Had a fantastic time, server was awesome.  Atmosphere was kinda down, table was dirty, washrooms were gross. But hey, I had an awesome time. Don't be picky and you'll enjoy yourself"}
{"text":"We only came here for drinks. Will need to come back to try their food.   Overall, I loved the atmosphere of this place and the servers were very friendly. I can't wait to try their food and their other cocktails."}
{"text":"Nice and comfortable inside. My GF ordered ribs. I ordered the hamburger pint special as advertised as a special of the day. I asked what beer came with the burger and Wht came on the burger. The ribs came black. The sauce was caramelized so hard that it was almost impossible to cut. The meat was burnt off. Asked the server for another. She returned and said that the chef won't do another one as that is how they make them there.  The manager will remove it from the bill. When the bill came the burger was $6 more than advertised. I asked about that. She said that was not the burger she gave me.  The advertised one was smaller. She ended up removing the difference from the bill. We won't be back."}
{"text":"5 stars for Dano, the bartender. Fun, personable, and great experience sitting at the bar. Fish tacos were good. Wings were not good. Cheesecake was fine, but not worth the calories. Beer was good. Manhattan was great. Would definitely come back as a place for food and drinks; and more importantly a fun time while sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"The daily soup is so good! But it is the consistency of water. Nice flavor and soft tasty bread, but broccoli, bacon, cheddar soup should be at least a little bit creamy, no?"}
{"text":"food made me sick, mentioned it to manager. He avoided me, telling staff to tell me he went to take care of his sick uncle so he can't give me any kind of refund for the rotten food."}
{"text":"We came here for a team lunch on a Monday at noon. The restaurant was very spacious, but very empty. We were seated right away. They have the usual on tap as well as some that I've never heard of, like some German beer that I can't pronounce. It looked pretty epic. The food, on the hand, left much to be desired. I ordered the fish and chips, and the fish was fried for too long. I suggest avoiding it. Some of my co-workers ordered the pizzas (8-inch pizzas?) and didn't particularly think it was good. One person ordered the ribs and thought it was delicious.  Note: The ATM is for patrons only. That's what it says on a sign at the front. Personally I don't know why it matters."}
{"text":"Has so much potential but the service is the big deterrent here. Management should fire them or at least retrain them so it's up to par. They take forever to come by, to take your order, are not friendly, don't stop by the table to see if things are ok etc. a friend of mine ordered a drink and when he complained that it wasn't made properly the waiter began to argue with them! it was outrageous. Drinks are mediocre if given the right drink. But i will say that the good specials are good like $7 mussels, so if youre looking for cheap food it might be a good destination for you, just don't expect good service here"}
{"text":"Awesome taste! Order a salmon sandwich on Friday special. Highly recommend you come here to try the food. Everyday has a different offer, such as Wing,1/2price, Wednesday from 4-9pm."}
{"text":"Great place to unwind and watch the game. Love the specials and the service! Super convenient location and always love coming back!"}
{"text":"We tried the Banknote for brunch and were generally quite pleased.  We were a little concerned as it was empty when we arrived, however, the service and food was very good, which should generate new customers over time.  The bar is clean, neat, and orderly.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  Our meals were hot and tasty.  You gotta like any place that serves real maple syrup at no extra charge!  Home fries had good flavour and the bangers were large and satisfying.  We have added the Banknote to our list of brunch places to return to."}
