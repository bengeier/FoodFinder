{"text":"I don't think ice cream can be any better than at Charlotte's Ice Cream on Lost Nation Rd. in Willoughby. Sooo smothe and creamy! And the flavors, wow."}
{"text":"Nice little Ice cream shop at the end of my street. We got two pineapple dole whips and a kids scoop of choc ice cream. I went back up and ordered a pint of this AMAZING pineapple ice cream. We spent about $15-16. Pricey for ice cream. The dol whips were pineapple just with ice and a twist of pineapple and vanilla ice cream. We though it would be better with out the ice. Since the pineapple ice cream is just a special I would much rather go to malleys in mentor or cp's in Willowick. If I'm feeling up to a drive the best two places IMO or mason's creamery in ohio city and Mitchel's in beachwood This place get's a two star for the price as they sell just your standard items the other 3/4 places I list make things from scratch and are better priced."}
