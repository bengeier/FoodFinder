{"text":"Pros
- Order at counter, they warm up pieces on the spot. No need for waiter, waitress
-  Good value for the price, 4-5$ for a very decent slice which is cut in two
- Variety of different toppings
- Nice and clean decor 

Cons: none"}
{"text":"Excellente pizza pas trop chargé mais vu la qualité des ingredients et l'attention portée a leur préparation, la pate croustillante et moelleuse et la sauce tomate qui goûte Rome c'est une des meilleurs pizza que j'ai manger a montreal. Si elle avait été cuite au four a bois ça serait dans mon top 3."}
{"text":"Super pizza ! La pâte est vraiment parfaite et différente. Je reviendai ! C'est un endroit plus pour emporter mais il y a de la place pour manger sur place."}
{"text":"Taglio Di Roma sells Romana styled pizza which comes neatly served in approximately 6 inch by 6 inch squares. Variety can be found and they get pretty creative with their pizza toppings.

We opted for a plate of 10 pizza slices from 5 different types of pizza.

Overall, good but not great. My main issue is that some of the slices were fresh and some were re-heated.... and the difference is quite noticeable. At least to me. And for the price I paid, I didn't necessarily expect re-heated pizza.

You can eat inside as they have large community tables, if you don't like sharing your table with others, don't come when it is busy.

3 stars with an extra one for being a family run business."}
{"text":"They often say the key to good food is keeping it simple and make it with love. Well I will talk to you of such a place and it's called Taglio Di Roma!  For starters you order first at the counter by choosing your pizza and there is a lot of choice. Once you choose and get your drinks and pay they reheat your pizza and bring it to your table. The dough is amazing, light and has these air bubbles that are so crisp. Now when you add quality ingredients to the mix that's where the magic happens. Over all nice look to the restaurant, clean lots of helpful staff but their secret weapon is the great food. By far one of my top pizza places around. To taste it, is to adopt it, and then you will know what I'm talking about. Compliments to the chef and staff you have a winner in your hands! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in decades. The crust is amazing and lots of choices for toppings.   Try the basic tomato pizza. Best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great dough! Really really great dough! Bubbly, crunchy without being hard, no sogginess. So far, it's the only pizza a taglio that comes close to what you might get in Italy."}
{"text":"A little bit far but worth the drive there.

Crust is thin and crispy.The ingredients are fresh and yuummy. As i am writting this, i am craving for some right now.

My favorite rome style pizza in mtl."}
