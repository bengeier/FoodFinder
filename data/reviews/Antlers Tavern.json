{"text":"Never been here until the new owner Chris took over. He is super nice and super inviting! Love locally owned bars and this one is one of my favorites! Cheap drinks, SUPER great burgers and that family bar atmosphere!  Would deff recommend checking out this place!"}
{"text":"One of the sketchiest bars in the Madison area. A friend and I stopped in for a nightcap out of morbid curiosity. This bar is dark on the outside; there are dangerous, predatory low-lifes on the inside. Rude, unprofessional bartenders who have no clue what they are serving. Want to see a fight or get in one? Want to be called misogynist/ homophobic slurs and get verbally harassed by drunk dudes (I was also punched pretty hard in the arm by this same guy)? Then Antlers is your kind of dive... we left in disgust after one beer, and will never return. I mean, really: I was afraid of being attacked while walking back to my car in the lot."}
{"text":"The bartenders they hire are great.  Seems like this place has a good crew of regulars, with bowling teams, etc. pinned up on the walls. 
But.....I have to say that this is one of the sketchiest bars I've ever been to.  In the hour or so we stopped in for cocktail after dinner on a Friday, I was thoroughly confused as to how this place is in business.  People are angsty to fight, some were so sh*tfaced they were unable to function, the bar smells just terribly (like really, really, really dirty fryers), and the exterior is scary at best with dark areas and lots of people lurking about.  
I super don't get it...... I want to get it...... I just don't get it."}
