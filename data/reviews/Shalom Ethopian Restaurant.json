{"text":"Wow wow!! Why isnt this place insanely popular.. loved the food especially the chicken dish thats served with egg.. Really nice staff ( owners I believe).. My first Ethiopian experience and was perfect."}
{"text":"Delicious, reasonably-priced food and very friendly staff. Decorated nicely with Ethiopian clothing and paintings of different Ethiopian tribes. Have been several times and definitely plan to keep going."}
{"text":"Family run restaurant with delicious Ethiopian food. All-teff (no-wheat) injera (flat pancake that doubles as plate and utensils) that is flown in from Ethiopia twice a week! Great service, very accommodating of requests. Inexpensive considering the quality of the food, and the uniquely robust delicacy with which it is prepared. Terribly romantic - it is often empty, and feels like our own hideaway! We go there 2x a week, sometimes. I almost hate to publicize it, but they are more than worthy of your business. Picture shows us digging in... meant to photograph it just as it came to the table, but we couldn't help ourselves!"}
{"text":"Finally! Terrific Ethiopian food in Cabbagetown. The quality of the local dining scene just took a giant leap forward."}
{"text":"This place was such a treat! It was my first time trying Ethiopian food and I had already looked up videos on how to share a large platter properly amongst friends. It's so fun! The lady was nice and suggested the spice tea to go with our meal. Much thanks and will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to be at when you are too lazy to cook and eat at home. The chef at the restaurant cooks really yummy food. Freshly made dishes right off the kitchen. Five star!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. First time I got the Shalom combo platter with meat and the second time I did the vegetarian one. Both times the food was delicious! I find the flavours for each item very distinct but all very flavourful and interesting. I think this is some of the best Ethiopian food I've had in the city. Once my friend also got this vegetarian dish of a stew-like consistency of cooked chickpea flour and it came in a cute little clay pot with injera on the side. It was packed full of flavour and tasted amazing absorbed in the bread. So aside from the platters, their individual dishes are definitely worth exploring too.   The prices are quite low and affordable and you are definitely getting more than your money's worth for the quality and quantity. The place itself is a bit dated in terms of decor/atmosphere, but the food is great so I don't care. Service is a bit slow at times but friendly. This is totally a hidden gem in Cabbagetown. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Could not find this at the address listed (10 June 2018). Either it's closed or the address is wrong. There's a bakery at that address. Or I missed it."}
{"text":"I've just been here once, and only for takeout, but the Veggie Taste of Shalom combo is crazy delicious, comes with lots of injera, and is a really large meal - big enough for me to have leftovers, even though I was ravenous. The woman who took my order was lovely & warm & offered me complimentary spice tea while I waited, which was really welcome on a cold, wet day. It's an awesome addition to the neighbourhood, and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new go-to Ethiopian restaurant. There's street parking outside and they take credit and debit cards. The outside of the restaurant made it look more like a bar or convenience store so I'm glad a fellow yelper put the picture up so I knew what I was looking for. The inside isn't anything to write home about but that's ok because I'm here for the food. Which was DELICIOUS! Get the Shalom special combo and add in the veggies and for $30, the two of you will be in Ethiopian heaven. The curried lentils were delicious and not mushy. The doro wat was saucy and not too spicy. The salad in the middle was fresh and zingy and made the injera extra tasty. This place is slamming and hit the spot. The staff were very pleasant and made you feel welcome. I have been disappointed with how Ethiopiques on church was getting stingy with their portions and now this is my replacement spot. A+ food! Go here you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Went here instead of Under the Table since it was too busy. The place didn't look like much from the inside but was impressive inside. The host was friendly and suggested two combos for our group of four. Trying Ethiopian for the first time, it tasted fantastic and was very flavorful. I highly recommend this hole-in-the-wall restaurant for anyone looking to try something unique in the city."}
{"text":"We were not saying \"Shalom!\" by the time we left. My boyfriend and I decided to go here for the first time, he had not tried Ethiopian food. When we wen't in no one else was there and the server seemed friendly at first, however things went completely south after that. She took our orders and clearly didn't understand what we had asked. As when she came back out of the kitchen and we asked for clarification she said we had asked for something else and that it will cost more than we had anticipated. We were upset but my boyfriend said it was fine and said he would pay. When the server came back out she brought our samosas with a little extra protein on it... there was a nice curly hair sitting on top. My boyfriend and I looked at one another as the server walked away... he chivalrously offered to eat the one that had the hair on it. Looking back we were too nice and should have said something immediately. \"Oh well\" we said and continued on. Next she brought out the platters, the food was tasting pretty good but I felt an itch in my throat and to my surprise it was another hair... this time triple the size....as i pulled it out of my esophagus i almost gagged. (Yuckkkk!) Enough was enough my boyfriend and i decided we didnt want to take our chances and encounter any more foreign dna in our food. We politely waited for the server to come out of the back kitchen. When she did, my boyfriend kindly explained to her that we had found the items in our food... Instantly she said \"What can I do?\" and \"It's not fair\" and when we said we were done eating (after a few bites) and not paying she accused us of planting the hair in the food... directly after that she told us she was calling the police and scurried to the back. As she did this my boyfriend and I left feeling stunned and threatened. Absolute lack of customer service and general courtesy. If you dont mind hair in your meal then bon appetit but if you have any common sense NEVER go here.   p.s. we also feel like she would keep the leftover food and serve to the next...."}
{"text":"Ignore the down at the heels exterior and slightly outre interior furniture.    This place has very friendly service and great Ethiopian food.  Order family style and they'll bring a nice platter with salad in the middle and extra injera on the side.  (The injera, btw, is especially delicious here.)  Lamb wat and a ground beef dish were especially tasty.  If you are in a group order a veggie combo to go with the meat dishes - it was also delightful.  No booze."}
{"text":"First time at Shalom and the service was great, and food was very enjoyable!  We ordered the Shalom combo platter (meat base), and it came with minced beef, tomato base \"beef stew\", braised chicken drumstick, and braised goat or lamb. The braised meats were my favorite for its depth of flavor and heat. The braised sauces reminded me of Mexican moles, but with Ethiopian spice. My husband really liked the tomato base \"beef stew.\"  We'll be back to try out the vegetarian combo platter next time! I'm glad there's a good Ethopian restaurant nearby knowing Nazareth is closed."}
