{"text":"The worst buffet that I have been to. Really small selection and none of the food was fresh. My son's garlic bread was hard as a rock. Barely anything to chose from, and nothing that my son liked. They didn't even have egg rolls and no one at the hibachi bar.  My husband almost got sick because they gave him a diet coke instead a regular coke.  Will never come back here again."}
{"text":"I POSTED A PICTURE THAT SAYS YUMMY IN MY TUMMY...I LIED... If you are pretty much on your last 5.00 and you want to pack up a crazy huge to go box, maybe try it out...but other than that...TRUST YOUR GUT AND KEEP DRIVING!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I always expect buffets to be somewhat mediocre but this place is just awful and over priced for it's small selection of food. They also charged us dinner price even though we were there during their lunch hours."}
{"text":"By far the worst buffet I have ever been to..not once did any of the food get changed out...and the selection horrible there is more deserts then actual hot food.. For crying out loud they don't even have egg rolls on the buffet! VERY DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"Horrible food, restaurant in poor condition, bad smell in the air when you walk in the door"}
{"text":"Chinese All you can eat buffet restaurant offers a variety of Asian dishes. Look for beef with broccoli, egg rolls, lo mein, orange chicken, shrimp, soup and more. Menu items vary. 

I am sure this place will be rated down and that is too bad. For what it is, it is not all that bad. The ambiance is worse than bad. It looks like the owners have decided to open a thrift store in the lobby and it has spilled over into the dining room. The food is mediocre at best, but for $5.25 all you can eat it, it is a good value. The food tastes fine, typical of \"Mall\" Chinese food. Give it a shot. You may like it. Just don't expect much other than decent food and fairly good service."}
{"text":"scary, unless you are homeless. stay away. disgusting, unsanitary, hole in the wall.
manager is a crazy lady who yells at you and watches you to make sure you dont take any food home.
tables sticky, bathroom is similar to ones you find at a truck stop, pealing paint and unkept.  carpet has holes in it and appears noone has cleaned it in a while."}
{"text":"DON'T GO HERE!!!!!!!  Unfortunately i had to go help my brother in Lorain so he reccomended we stop at this place........i'll never listen to him again. How to describe going here.........a complete trainwreck. The 1st indication something was wrong was you could only park on one side of the lot (which was completely full of potholes) and it was completely coated with a thick layer of ice that the owners don't feel the need to use salt so the patrons can die on their way in. The 2nd indication something was wrong was it used to be a ponderosa but they had the entire front of the place (the old window booth area) completely hidden with blankets and all the windows were covered. Then we get to the food........i live in cleveland and i have frequented asian buffets all over Ohio and this was by far the worst food i've ever had the displeasure of eating. I always get sushi but this sushi was worse than sub par it was complete garbage.......it was either all frozen ingredients or from a can. They had no selection and didnt fill trays often at all. Then i figured id try some of the chicken dishes since everything else looked fairly stale and unappetizing.......i kid you not the chicken tasted like it had been sitting around all day it was awful. It's all dark meat chicken and it tasted funny like maybe it had gone bad but they over cooked it to hide the fact. I had a few bites of things but wouldn't dare finish any of it so then i figured im not leaving her on an empty stomach so a safe bet would be the salad bar you'd figure, right !?!?!? Well you figured wrong the salad was all slimy and wilted it was disgusting. The 4th indication something was wrong were the signs everywhere telling customers not to waste the food.......why would you do that!?!?!? Thats just pissing people off so they will waste. Besides if the food wasnt god awful it wouldn't be wasted. The desserts were lacking in quality and quantity as well. I wouldnt feed their garbage to my brothers dog for fear he'd get sick and die. Im surprised i didnt get ill. The only thing they had that looked at all appetizing was the crab legs that they never refilled that my brother was 2 afraid to touch cause of the sign that stated: \"only 6 per customer\". Oh and they seem to serve alcohol which somehow i doubt they have the liscense for. I paid around $30 for my brother and i and i left with an empty stomach, disgusted. I know lorain is a dump but seriously.........this was bad even for lorain."}
