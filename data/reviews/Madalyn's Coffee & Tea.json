{"text":"Recently moved from California and was looking for a place with a good coffee. And I found it!!! Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Next time you're in the Birkdale area please do yourself a favor and visit Madalyn's.  They have an exhausting variety of coffee and tea, there's no doubt you will find something to put a smile on your face.    I ordered a cafe olé which sounds high speed, but it's just half coffee, half steamed milk.  At work I only drink coffee black so this was a nice change of pace for me without going into \"coffee candyland\".  While hot at first, once cooled to room temperature this was an extremely smooth drink.  A memory I will relish until my next visit!  Check it out and let us know what you think!"}
{"text":"Best coffee shop in the area! The coffee is amazing and Lou is just great! Always feel welcome! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great Place, Awesome Location and the Best Coffee. & Tea around!!!"}
{"text":"We went here when they first opened. While the owner was very friendly as I recall, the place was dirty. I brushed it off as they hadn't settled in. Unfortunately, the couple of times we popped in it seemed just the same. The inside was a mismatch of I don't know what and not in a cool eclectic way. Outside seating looked awful too. I'm excited for whatever it will be. Would love another coffee shop or something like that. Just clean this time."}
{"text":"Always friendly. Always good. Always fast. Their fresh brewed coffee is legit. Definitely a cozy little spot to go enjoy a cup of Joe. I would certainly recommend this place to anybody who hasn't tried it yet. You're missing out!"}
{"text":"I was working in the Kenton Drive area and found this nice little local coffee shop on Yelp. I went and got a coffee and a blueberry muffin for breakfast. The muffin and the coffee were great, but what makes this place exceptional is the atmosphere and local feel. This would definitely be my choice for coffee if I lived or worked regularly on this end of the Catawba Ave. exit at Lake Norman."}
{"text":"Love this quaint little place. Friendly staff and owner. I especially love their smoothies. Great prices and sweet location. I will definitely be a regular here. The owner says he can make anything that Starbucks can and I have seen him In action!! Awesome local coffee shop"}
{"text":"This has become my go too place. Perfect stop on the way to work and much more friendly and enjoyable then your typical coffee chain. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Oh how I wish I lived closer!!  Location--excellent! Coffee--perfectly brewed and HOT! Seating--comfy! Owner--delightful!  So if you are anywhere near exit 28 or 25 you are missing out if you are not visiting Madalyn's for your coffee, tea or chai fix each day!    I am someone who enjoys hot coffee and too many places use those forsaken air pots that result in a hot cup for the first person lucky enough to stop by after it is brewed. NOT an issue here-the Roman's Roast I had was piping hot and so fresh!!  I loved that when I asked about what was being offered that day the exceptionally engaging and genuine gentleman behind the counter was able to clearly articulate the flavor profile of each without it being snobby or off putting. I later discovered he's the owner and he's a shining example of all that is right with a small business owner. Very welcoming to everyone as they entered, greeting regulars by name as they arrived and patiently explaining products to people who asked such questions as 'what is a chai latte' without the least bit of condescension!   The mix of table/chair, stool/bar and upholstered seating really makes the space work well for whatever the purpose of your stay. I met a group of friends to chat and others were there working solo, I heard one job interview take place and one mom on her day off just holed up with her phone to surf the net while her child (quietly and exceptionally well behaved) enjoyed the children's programming on TV and entertaining himself quietly.   Parking at the cute coffee shops is often vexing. That is not a problem here!  I was glad to see a mix of spots in front that are door ding free if you know how to parallel park (thanks to my driving teacher in 1983 for making sure we were experts on that!) and plentiful side by side spots behind the store. The live/work environment with apartment living above most of the businesses in Kenton Place lend a feeling of it being your corner coffee shop, even if you drive to get there.   When you ask yourself what is the model of a great place for coffee or tea and a few minutes off the fast paced path of life...Madalyn's is it.   Well done, very well done!"}
{"text":"Great tasting coffees and a cool place to hang out with friends. Unlike chain oriented coffee shops the personalized service leaves you coming back to talk to the owner and the baristas. I love supporting family own businesses and Madalyn's coffee & tea is quaint friendly establishment that offers a European feel that has great beverages and relaxation. You will not be in a hurry to leave once you arrive.  They offer the popular drinks that your accustom with at other coffee businesses as well as a wide selection of teas. If you need to break away from the ultra loud and busy coffee chains then please visit this store, they have free wifi, outdoor seating and it's tucked away in a quiet street. You will be happy you stopped in."}
{"text":"Today I went to Madalyn's for the first time and I can't emphasize enough how great this place is and how friendly the owner (Lewis) is! He happily greeted me and my husband and served us a delicious caramel latte! He's very pleasant and we had a great chat with him. The atmosphere is very cozy and warm. It's a great place to lounge, read a book or get some work done on your laptop. The costumer service goes beyond 5 stars! Highly recommended. We will certainly come back!"}
{"text":"The friendliest coffee shop I've ever been to -- the owner is so warm and welcoming. I adore almond milk in my coffee drinks and was pleased to see that they offer it. I ordered an almond milk Irish crème cappuccino and it was fantastic. The wifi is fast and I hung out for more than two hours, sipping coffee, working and chatting with other friendly people who were also hanging out and enjoying the friendly atmosphere. A terrific local gem!!"}
{"text":"I tried Madalyn's tonight with my girlfriend and was very impressed. I ordered a Vanilla Chia Latte that was very good and she ordered a Chocolate Chip Mint Latte. We both really enjoyed our drinks. I would highly recommend. I will be back soon. The owner is very nice and personable."}
{"text":"Friendly helpful staff. Excellent selection of craft roasted coffee. Amazing selection of teas. They use Di Vinci syrups. Comfortable seating and work tables.  Patio seating and great parking front and back!  A must try."}
{"text":"Got an iced coffee with cream. It was incredibly smooth (cold brew?) and delicious. Lewis introduced himself to me and made conversation while he got my order ready. He's got a really likeable personality, and his business has a very down-to-earth feel."}
{"text":"I'm a very picky coffee drinker and this establishment knocked it out of the park!! Very please and will definitely splurge and go back!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Such a cute little place. It was actually smaller than I expected it to be thus very cozy. I could see this place getting very crowded on a weekend morning. In a place this small I would not want to stay and linger if there were more than six people in there. However, the coffee was delicious. The customer service was excellent. A young guy (he said he was 18) helped me and I totally forgot his name. But, he has the personality for customer service. I had the caramel mocha and it was slurpy good!  I'll be back! Gonna check out their other location in Cornelius as it is larger."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. This place is filthy dirty. This is my second time there and not even soap in the restrooms. Spilled and dried hard coffee on the coffee tables. Debris on the floor.  Do not go here."}
{"text":"Want a nice quiet place to meet clients?  I though this was a great place to have a meeting.  They are in the process of expanding a bit to add more seating but for now they have  a standup bar, two comfy chairs up front and two larger tables to seat 4.  The coffee was excellent and I love that he has his own roast.  This is a more intimate place, so good if you are meeting someone new and don't want a huge loud coffee shop.  It is in a good location to grab a good coffee on your way to work in the morning.    Check it out & Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm in Charlotte for a wedding this weekend, and I was looking for cool local coffee shops in the area to check out, and I'm so glad I found this one on yelp!   The first thing that stood out to me was all the creative drink flavors! You can basically get any flavor hot, iced, or blended. I got a Salted Caramel Iced Latte, because that's my favorite thing to get; but, some of the other flavors they had were Caramel Apple, Pumpkin Pie, Orange Chocolata, Chocolate Chip Mint, Frosted Mint Mojito, etc.   For those less adventurous, don't worry, they still have all the classic drinks you're looking for! And the quality of the coffee is great! They also offer all-natural smoothies, a bunch of teas, and \"Madacinnos\", which are a play on the frappucinos of Starbucks.  The owner is very friendly, and he definitely knows what he's doing and you can tell it's his passion. I love supporting local coffee shops, and will definitely be stopping by Madalyn's again next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Madalynn's is not a bad joint. It's conveniently located near home for me. The area around is known for mini-festivals, the small farmer's market that will hopefully kick into full swing soon and of course the night life of the Galway Hooker Irish pub right across the way. It finds itself in a cozy nook with a few tables and chairs for relaxing and a TV for keeping up with the latest turn of events.  With all the other stuff they've got going on in the area they've certainly been in need of a cafe to mix up the collection a bit. Lewis, the proud owner of Madalyn's, claims he can make anything the other guys (Starbucks, etc) can. I'm no coffee drinker myself but I can speak for the tea which is not bad. However the selling point for me would have to be the warm caramel apple cider. It was the best way to start a cold day off! Meanwhile, when warmer months approach, I'll be awaiting a green tea frappuccino that can rival my personal all-time favorite by the Bucks.  A note for Lewis: take a walk down to the farmer's market tent with the pumpkin and banana nut bread loafs, buy a few, slice them and sell them in your store. These go great with the teas, coffees, ciders, etc. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Ugh. To start, the owner/barista is super nice and helpful. And that is where it ends. They offer Black Powder Roasters which is named correctly bc it tastes like black (gun) powder that is burnt. It is an inferior roaster. Period. Ok, next is how dirty the place is. Super dusty and plain old dirty. Floors, fans, shelves, and my personal pet-peeve, the bathroom! The toilet is in major need of a clean. Anyway, the music, Christian radio, is very loud and hard to make phone calls, or even concentrate. And lastly, the styrofoam cups top off the experience. I never understood the reason why owners don't choose ceramic coffee cups when staying. Cost I presume. But, it gives it a cheap feel."}
{"text":"Awesome espresso and smooth regular coffee!! I love local and this is as good as it gets!!"}
{"text":"Quaint lil coffee shop - perfect for a pick me up after a day on the lake. Great coffee and the owner was quick to help us make a selection to quench our thirst that hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Am a big fan of going local so, it was only a matter of time before I got to Madalyn's on a weekend of running errands.  The owner is very friendly and has done all the right things in terms of reaching out to locals using tools like Yelp.  I stopped in for my first visit on a recent Sunday morning and was warmly greeted by Lewis, the owner of Madalyn's.  Turns out they have been in business for about 10.5 months.  Lewis is as friendly in person as he was on his reach out campaign when they opened.  He also followed up my visit with a nice thank you note on Yelp so, big points for warmth and a customer first attitude.   In terms of the beverage itself, I ordered a Cafe Americano.  It was appropriately hot but to me, a little on the weak side.  I'm giving it a pass though since I thought after I left that when I order that particular brew elsewhere, its always with an extra shot of Espresso so, may be comparing apples to oranges.  Lewis was also struggling with a bad batch of lids for his cups and the one I got was certainly not snug but, that's a supplier issue and I expect it to be resolved.  All in all, Madalyn's seems like a good addition to our area and most of the other reviews I've read have been 4-5 stars.  I will certainly be back and look forward to a 4-5 star update to this review."}
{"text":"I have always felt so at home at this place everyone is so personal and friendly and the building has such a homey feel. I don't feel like I'm stepping into a corporate chain rather I feel like its my friends living room. Absolutely wonderful coffee for both sweet tooth's and dry unadulterated coffee drinkers. Really recommend stopping by and staying for a while to study or browse the internet."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time a few months ago. The reviews on yelp sounded good so we walked our dog down and went to Madalyn's! The guy was very sweet and we mentioned that this was our first time so he made us a drink to try. It was very good, but a little too syrupy for my taste. Maybe next time we can just try a regular coffee drink. I'll be back to try it again."}
{"text":"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways! Lewis is an extraordinary human being! Not only can he make amazing coffee, but he's just such a generous, kind and great person! I love spending time here and I love his drinks! Great combo of good drinks and good conversations! I really can't say more about how much I love this place! I love the vanilla latte and mocha maddachino! Yummm"}
{"text":"What cute, little coffee (& tea) shop!  My daughter and I stopped by this week and enjoyed a couple coffees. We made our selections based on the owner's advice and loved them. He also gave us a coffee mug - for free!  Next time I will order less flavor shots (I always forget to do that - I don't like very sweet coffee) and I'm sure that the owner will make it just right!  Looking forward to trying some of their loose tea. They had the most amazing-smelling lemon black tea.   If you're in the area, stop by. Great coffee in a clean and friendly shop!"}
