{"text":"Food was very good and fresh, especially the squid, bread and bavette steak. However, the service was bad - the waiter barely paid any attention to us and way too much time between servings. Until they get their service together I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The best dining experience I've had in a while. We had the marinated olives, grilled squid, leek noquis and Tres Leches cake - absolutely everything was divine. Only comment would be that the staff was almost too attentive, felt like every five minutes someone was checking in on us. But will definitely be back again and hopefully again."}
{"text":"4.5 stars 

We had a reservation and came in a slightly late Sat night (8:45pm) during long weekend. The restaurant is busy but not packed - there are empty seats at the bar and no people waiting in line ( so if you feel spontaneous in the Ossington neighbourhood give it a try?).

We didn't order any of the appetizers and instead shared a few bigger plates. We had the grilled squid, grilled cabbage, blood sausage (morcilla), short ribs and the banana flavoured dessert. Overall every dish is fabulously put together. The flavour is balanced and tasty. We especially enjoyed the short ribs and the dessert. Highly recommend! 

If anything, the blood sausage dish might be slightly less impressive because the side (grilled lettuce) and the sausage are kind of like two random things put together in one plate - lack of connection in presentation and flavour. 

Overall, this is one really good restaurant. The portion might seem a bit small to some people but keep in mind is more of a tapas style restaurant so it's better to come in with what to expect. The reason I gave 4.5 is because for the materials we were eating - offal, pork vegetable and no seafood, some dishes are definitely a bit pricy. We ended up spending $50+ before tips each person and we didn't have any drinks."}
{"text":"Small portions and overpriced food. $7 for 1 empanada and $6 for a couple small pieces of sour dough bread are but 2 prime examples of how little you get for your money here. The food was ok but nothing special. For what is supposedly an Argentinan type restaurant, the best dish was the chicken Milanese, not the bavette or short rib, which were just average. 

Vibe left something to be desired. Service was fine but not amazing. I had high hopes for this place and was disappointed. I won't return."}
{"text":"Very good food, atmosphere and service. Downside - portions are small and pricey. We had the sourdough, salad, short rib, grilled squid, grilled cabbage, marinated eggplant, and tres leche cake.... And felt like we could've had a second dinner. Bill was almost $200 including a beer and wine, which seemed excessive. Special occasion I guess!"}
{"text":"Can I say, I was, delighted and pleasantly surprised that I could be surprised that their food is that good. The restaurant is the perfect blend of casual and food sophistication.

Our small army of finicky diners were all thumbs up on all items ordered. The worm like potatoes were the most unique in my books and the fish we had was my highlight of the evening. 

One cannot stop at just one visit as the menu is decent enough so that you won't be experiencing the same old some every time. As well, their daily special helps change things up."}

{"text":"A welcomed addition to the hopping Ossington strip. Staff was all very friendly, genuine and our waters were always topped up. The Server made great recommendations who did a great job romancing features of the day. We had the potato churros, which was nice and airy, the ricotta empanada with a nice hint of smokiness but $7 for one piece. Squid was well cooked, meticulously plated with good texture but so much smaller than we imagined. Wagu steak was also good quality and well cooked, sides can be improved to match such a rich meat. I enjoyed the story that it was locally sourced from paradise farm. You can tell the owner/chefs care about the vendors he partners with and the quality of his meat and produce. 

Overall the food was great but overpriced by just a few dollars each dish but I guess that's what you get for Ossington rent. Service was attentive and friendly. Room was warm and lively. However, after $70 per person, my husband and I had to grab dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food and service were both really good BUT the portion size was way too small. I knew we were in for it when the even the bread we ordered was laughably tiny. 

The spicy beef empanadas was way better than the ricotta one. The potato churros were really good. Don't get the pickled eggplant (waste of money). The squid was really good but for $18 not worth it. The sweetbreads were really good, leek with mushrooms and short ribs were my favourites and possibly worth the price... possibly. 

We brought company from out of town to this restaurant and honestly, it was a little embarrassing. The food tasted good for the most part but after spending $60 each we had to go get pizza to be full."}
{"text":"Alright this place used to be Hungry Amoo, I liked this place a lot, but due to reasons they were forced to seek other venture. This place is now new home to Tanto Argentinian Restaurant,
The place looks warm, and staff are well mannered and well groomed/dressed. 
Menu selection is great, I loved the potato moose, and grilled calamari, no the grilled calamari isn't your average calamari, it's full of flavour. The steel head trout also was amazing. The potato moose is great and has a interesting texture, I could have bowls of it every day. 
The short ribs are amazing, loved the combination of grilled lettuce and rib, with chimni churri made it even better.
I would definitely come back again. I'd love to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Overall great experience. Delicious menu with interesting flavor combinations especially for the vegetable dishes. Favourites:

leek noquis with hen of the woods mushrooms taleggio 
grilled cabbage with egg yolk, pesto, and guanciale"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this more than I did.  Service was good and the food was pretty good. Like others, I knew what I was getting into with this restaurant and enjoy sharing lots of small plates.  And yet I was still disappointed by the portion sizes and left hungry despite having 8 dishes between 2 ppl."}
{"text":"Tanto is a comfortable Latin restaurant on Ossington near Queen. The menu is a great selection of small and large dishes, different meats, veggie and seafood. Not a taco in sight! We decided to let the house choose for us and every dish was flavourable and nicely presented. My favourite was the grilled squid but the tuna tartare was excellent and the meat dishes were done perfectly including a tasty sweetbreads dish. Nice wine selection and some inventive cocktails I would like to try. Service was outstanding. I really enjoyed our meal here and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Big flavour in small bites.
I would definitely come back for a special occasion.
The wine was amazing.
Our server informed us of 2 specials that day. We ended up getting the ceviche and it did not disappoint.
If you are really hungry, this may not be the best place to eat. (Unless you are willing to spend a lot)."}
{"text":"4.5 stars... great new place in Toronto that should get some love.  It is in it's first week of opening and I honestly could not tell ... there are zero growing pains experienced.  It is well run on all accounts... environment, service, and tastes.  It's all there.  

Toronto was missing a really good restaurant that put out Latin American dishes that wasn't tacos or Mexican.  Tanto fills that gap and I love this place.  Around the world, I've had some great moments eating Peruvian & Argentinian... I almost feel that Toronto hasn't discovered the great flavours from this particular region.  Now I can come back here on Ossington instead of picking up a plane ticket!

On Ossington, Tanto is a wonderfully intimate & subtley elegant space.  I liked how I could have a conversation without yelling and how there was lots of spaces between tables.  It's a good vibe here as the nicely dim lights just reveals the smaller details like the tufted velvet banquette, glimmers of the chandelier over the bar, or the distressed original brick walls.  The open kitchen with the blaze of the wood fire was an interesting visual distraction.

Service here was great... attentive, knowledgeable, and the right amount of presence.  It never was pretentious and it was always thoughtful.  As with most new restaurants, it's shared small plates.  We ordered  a few dishes from each area. I also have to admit the additional gift of one dish was unexpected but help make a wonderful night even better.

Potato churros - This was a savoury take on the sweet churros.  As explained, Chef Julian didn't want to do the conventional french fries and this is a nice twist.  Super crispy and light, it came with a nicely sweet & savoury dipping sauce.  I really liked how the churros had a prominent chive note that elevated it.  4/5

Squash Empanadas - I think these were fried and I know purists say that isn't right but I loved these.  Super crispy crust surrounding a very creamy & naturally sweetened squash interior.  It is one of the more expensive empanadas I've had ($7 each) but it's definitely one of my favourites I've had all year & worth the price tag.  4.5/5

Marinated Eggplant - Interesting take on eggplant.  I've been on an eggplant binge with eating them at Bar Sybanne, Craft & commerce, every thai place ... this one was simple and had clean flavours.  With the roast garlic puree underneath, the tender pieces of eggplant sat on top with it's charred skin becoming a darkened dusting on top.  The addition of chilli adds the right amount of heat.  4/5

Grilled Squid - If there is an item to order... it was would be this.  My most favourite squid dish all year.  Honestly.  Super tender with the right amount of smokiness.  The addition of the chewy preserved mushroom and pancetta adds to the savoury depth and texture.  I honestly loved every piece and would have happily eaten another plate of this. 5+/5

Bavette with chimichuri - Wood grilled meats are a key dish of Argentina and this was really nicely done.  It was cooked more towards the rare side and the inner carnivore in me was so happy with the flavour.  This is saying a lot since I'm a vegetarian Monday to Friday.  This was very tender with the smokey & beefy flavours being really pronounced.  The addition of the chimichuri was a great burst of vibrant herbs.  5/5

Banana and dulce de leche milhojas (millefeuille) - I was ready to go for the poached pear but the words uttered of 'millefeuille' made me stop.  This is a really great take on the classic French dessert.  With rich banana custard & creamy dulce de leche caramel sandwiches between flakey & super crispy pastry layers, it was a great ending to a wonderful dinner.  It was not a super sweet dessert but a nice balance overall.  5/5

I think Tanto is a great Argentinian restaurant & a wonderful addition to the Toronto food scene.  It's a place I'll definitely come back to try more dishes!  With it's near perfect flavours & service, I feel it'll only get better as it hits its stride."}
{"text":"An excerpt from a longer review. 

\"Throughout the years, many cultures have put a spin on empanadas--a staple in Spanish and South American cuisine. While Tanto's smoked ricotta empanada ($7) contained no meat, la cuisine nailed the smoky flavour and crimped dough that was deep fried rather than baked. Plated with an oversized plastic bottle of Tanto's hot sauce (like one you'd buy at the dollar store), I found the presentation to be uncharacteristically low-brow and tacky. A small side bowl would have been more à propos.
Beef is usually the star protein at any Argentine restaurant, and I had to try some. The bavette (flank) and sweetbreads didn't appeal to me, so my guest and I opted for the short ribs with chimichurri and grilled lettuce ($34). Tanto's grill, fuelled by wood fire, lent the perfect whiff of smoke to the short ribs without being overpowering. As tasty as the perfectly rosy ribs were, we enjoyed more innovative menu offerings, such as the leek noquis.\""}
