{"text":"We found this place while looking for something to eat around GCC. The inside is setup like a Quizno's, which the place was, in a former life. You can get anything as a wrap or a sandwich, and you get them hot or cold. The food was great and the service was too. Come check it out for yourself and try something in a Jalape√±o wrap!"}
