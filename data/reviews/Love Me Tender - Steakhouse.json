{"text":"It is time the Beach has a proper steak house and Tender might just be the one.  We ordered sirloin  and scallops entries for dinner.  Both were excellent.   The service was attentive which really set it apart from others.  I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Not great. My husband and I were very excited to have a steakhouse in town, but were sorely disappointed when we got our meal. The prices were outrageous for what we got. They try to look fancy but the quality didn't match up. The steak was tender but wasn't happy with the sauce they used to season it. Two, for the prices they charge you would hope to get hand cut fries, but we got bagged frozen fries instead. I could have made this at home for a quarter of the price and for half the time it took for the meal to finally arrive at our table. We were one of two tables and the meal took forever. Unless they make significant changes, we won't be coming back. It's a shame."}
{"text":"The steak here was really delicious!   My family and I went May 6 as a pre-Mother's Day night out. We are huge steak lovers and were impressed with the business; they had only been open around a month, and I see a bright future for them in the Beaches! We've been needing a place nearby that really specializes in steak!   The service was very friendly, and it was clear that the staff wanted the restaurant to do well, which reflects good management and good hiring.   My mother commented it was one of the best steak and frites she had ever had. I had the steak and frites also, but with the option of a mushroom/veggie garnish on top. The garnish was delicious; however, I won't be getting the garnish next time, because the meat quality is SO good and so well flavoured that garnish isn't required! Very good pricing for what we had (only $20 for the steak and frites that we had!!).   For those who are keen on atmosphere, they've done well with the already naturally beautiful interior (exposed brick on either side is always a plus for any building!). The decor they've chosen is lovely. Also, I don't normally care about music in a restaurant, but their music choice was really good; a good Frank Sinatra kind of vibe.   We'll definitely be back again; my parents (who are Beaches veterans, have lived here for 25 years) both said as we were all walking home \"well we just found our new steak place!\" Thank you \"Love Me Tender\" - if all your customers have the same experience that my family had, you're going to be a VERY popular spot in the Beaches!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and it's even better than I remembered. I ordered the French Onion Soup for an appetizer, which was exquisite. While waiting for the appetizers we were served French baguette served with herbed butter, garlic hummus, sliced pickles, and baby Kalamata olives.   For the main course, Coquilles St Jacques with a side of mushrooms cooked in white wine and maple syrup. The maple syrup was perfectly balanced by the wine, giving it a candied sweetness that was light, easy to eat (but hard to stop!). The Coquilles St Jacques is a seafood dish served with mashed potatoes and pastry in a delicious cream sauce, generously portioned with fresh scallops, salmon, and well-sized shrimp. There's a secret ingredient in the dish that gives it a complex and full flavor that must be experienced, but I won't spoil the secret!   The service is friendly, and the owner is likely to stop by your table to say hello and see how the meal is.   Plenty of menu options for vegetarians and carnivores alike.   I was too full to try the deserts, but we took some tiramisu to go!  A \"must eat here\". Five stars. We will be back for a third visit."}
{"text":"I have lived in The Beach my whole adult life and seen restaurants come and go but this one has to be a keeper. The service and ambiance was really terrific and the steaks were amazing. It was a very special birthday and they went out of their way to make my 90 year old mother fantastic with a rise and a lovely free desert. Great wines and vastly superior food and the people next to us were having gourmet burgers which looked mouthwatering. Go to this place you will love it. It's a true steakhouse and worth the trip. We need to support local entrepreneurs you will really love it"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food, and ambiance!   We were greeted with excellent, prompt, and friendly service which continued throughout our experience. The bartender executed the drinks perfectly (recommend the Love Me Tender martini). The food was fantastic! The steak sandwich was tender and juicy and the bison burger was incredible! As for sides, the dishes came with savory corn on the cob and a coleslaw that was remarkable.  Definitely a great place if you enjoy steak and burgers. Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Took my meat loving son there a few months back. It is a pricey place compared to others in the beach however their food is really good. We had the steak frits and it was super tasty. Sadly other half of family are vegetarian so we haven't been back since. I will take my son there soon for another meal."}
{"text":"So, finally, something approximating a true steak house in the beach... This new undertaking in the former location of Green Eggplant (who have moved just a little East to the former Il Fornello location).  Don't take the awning at face value, it appears to scream chain restaurant, which is not the atmosphere once you enter. It's a comfortable urban modem feeling restaurant, clean lines, requisite hardwood floors and long  walls down to the original brick.  That and a well varied jazz soundtrack in the background, without being overly Sinatra....  However, the service needs a little help, our waitress had significant challenges dealing with our Beaujolais, to the point of being unable to get the cork out of the bottle, she did in fact break the cork, at which point she took it away to the bar. One would think that server 101 in a steakhouse would be the ability to competently serve a bottle of red wine...  The service was redeemed to some degree by the meals themselves, the quinoa stuffed mushrooms app as well as the bone-in ribeye and chimichurri charred prawns met expectations, it is unfortunate that we also ordered a side of asparagus, the latter was overcooked to the point of almost being paste, realistically they should never have been served....   What was headed to be a solid 3 star review was redeemed at the last moment by the desserts, now if only yelp would allow half stars ina review.  The baked blueberry cheesecake and double chocolate tart where  very good and above expectations bases on the rest of the experience.  I'm also being a little generous since they have only been open for a week or so, hopefully like a good red wine this establishment matures and improves with age, will be back to test this theory..."}
{"text":"We had a GroupOn and hopefully they will have enough another at some point. 80 bucks for two apps, one salad and two mains. With a carafe of wine it was easily doubled.   Steaks were ok, fries were frozen as some mentioned, sad about that. Everything was moderate. Not sure because of the GroupOn or not.  Had a bit of a Gordon Ramsey \"Restaurant Rescue\" happening as we sat close to the kitchen. Owners seemed VERY micromanaging of all the staff, and too much for the kitchen. Hope it isn't their downfall. Not sure if I would ever go back. Honestly I prefer the Keg."}
{"text":"So Tenders is probably one of the most expensive restaurants in the Beach.  The beers are your every day domestic variety e.g., Labatts Blue but charged with a bit of a premium.  The wines are your casual LCBO wines like yellow tail, marked up more than twice.   I was hoping for a better selection of wines at a Steak house.     The Steaks are priced close to $40 so I was expecting pretty awesome flavours but it just wasn't special in anyway.  My son had a burger and fries that was approaching $20 bucks.    Meh.    The opening breads and spreads (humus and olives) seem like they went to loblaws and bought stuff off the shelf.  The pickles were cut into quarters as if that would make it fancier.    Dinner for two with appetizer, main and dessert should be over well $100 before alcohol.      Tip: they didn't take reservations.  Don't know why.   In my opinion, it is not worth the wait."}
{"text":"We went here the first week they opened and were quite disappointed. The menu was fine dining prices...we were excited to get a fine dining restaurant in the Beach. HOWEVER the food was awful and they were penny pinching on butter etc. We went again with a group of 10 (we had 2 couples visiting from Scotland) figuring we would give them another chance....hoping they had the time now to improve. This time the food was good however they were still penny pinching on butter, sour cream etc. The young waitress was amazing but the older lady (manager/owner?) couldn't look more miserable and her attitude was as she looked. At one point we asked for something to keep the white wine cold and she actually said \"you'll have it finished before it has time to get warm\". We were shocked but insisted she get something to cool it. She ended up giving us a steel water pitcher filled with ice. After dinner we waited and waited....and waited for coffee,tea and dessert to be offered. Finally we asked and she said..,sorry we don't have dessert left and it's too late to make coffee? It wasn't even 10pm? She did however say we could order liquors. At this point I was furious and just asked for the bill we were leaving. The young waitress was so embarrassed. I felt so sorry for her as there was nothing she could do.this COULD have been an amazing addition to the Beach if they had done it right."}
{"text":"First visit to this new spot in the Beach. Really wanted it to be great as it's the only steakhouse in the area.  The first & major disappointment is that not only is there no wine list- understandable as they are new, but a chalkboard announcing what wines are available, by the glass and bottle with prices can easily be done.  The 2 white options were not appealing to me. Although one of them, an Australian Chardonnay was \"ok\", not knowing whether I would be charged $12 or more was a turn-off. I know I could have asked but shouldn't have to.  The menu prices are outrageous. One only has to go to The Green Eggplant to compare. And with food prices that high, one can only imagine the wines prices will compare.  That being said, hubby chose the Merlot, which he didn't enjoy. The good news was that it only cost $7.50.  In the end, I opted for the safe but far less satisfying choice, a bottle of Perrier.  We both chose the Philly Steak which frankly, was superb. Excellent quality steak served with grilled half-cob of corn and Waldorf coleslaw.   Sure would have like to have it with a glass of wine though. We did feel the $16 price was worth it.  One downer to the meal itself though- if you're not a fan of frozen fries, beware.   Service was attentive- although the wait for our meal seemed very long.  The atmosphere is very formal- maybe too much so in this very casual part of town, especially at lunch.  We understand the wine list is being selected.  Will we return? I'm not so sure.  Not with so many other excellent choices in the area at better prices and ambience."}
{"text":"I have been in this restaurant several times. Twice for dinner. Ordered a steak, it was okay, I thought, it was price reasonably. Recently, I went back breakfast and they served me a burned bread - the sides of the bread is not eatable. The manager offered to give another item on the menu, so I ordered a \"pancake\", the pancake came after my husband was done with his meal and the pancake was \"raw\" and not eatable. I left without eating anything. It was a waste of time. It's too bad. This is why restaurants should be very careful hiring their chef. It could break the business."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the burgers but if they are as good as the steaks then their great. Great staff with good service. The prices more than reasonable. Atmosphere nice. Update they are gone. To bad."}
{"text":"You'd think a steak house would serve a decent burger and fries, especially when it's close to $20, unfortunately you'd be wrong. The patty itself was excessively garlicky, almost like a Lick's frozen patty. It was also kind of chewy in spots, and not in a good way. Fries were definitely frozen. I'm not the biggest fan of The Green Eggplant, which is a few blocks away, but they serve a much better burger at a better price"}
