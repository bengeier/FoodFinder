{"text":"The food is yummy and unique here - the skewers were especially delicious.  Spicy clams are worth ordering."}
{"text":"They kept the same interior design from last middle eastern restaurant. The food was pretty good i got the raddish and lamb soup for 12.99, pork green pepper dish $12.99, 4pc lamb skewer, cuttle fish skewer and tendon skewer. All together the cost with tax is $60 which was pretty expensive but we ordered more food than we can eat. I recommend the lamb skewers because the meat is chunky with lots of flavour. The skewers taste better than the other beef noodle place that recently open."}
{"text":"Had the beef brisket noodle soup and the spicy beef tendon. Both were flavorful and plentiful"}
{"text":"Great new authentic Northern Chinese restaurant. Flavours were on point and food was delicious! The old fashioned pork and the chicken clay pot stew were very tasty."}
{"text":"I am leaving a review because of other poor reviews. Usually, I don't go to restaurants with bad reviews but I went there because it was recommended by my family member. It was amazing for sure.   Lamb skewers were very authentic. All my food was not salty and had no strong msg or chemical tastes. It may taste less stronger than other Chinese restaurants, but it was more close to home cooked food."}
{"text":"I entered this place after seeing news of its new opening on insauga, and was very shocked to see the low and abysmal ratings on Yelp. Surprisingly, this place well exceeded my expectations! I really think what you orders makes a huge difference.  We ordered a couple things to share among the four of us: a lamb hot pot ($19.99), lamb noodles in claypot ($12.99), hot spicy chicken ($13.99), and a small white rice. The waitress then persuaded us to also order something off the menu, and get their \"flower roll\", a white bun steamed with oil and scallions. Bad decision. That was the nastiest, oiliest, and blandest carb I have ever placed in my mouth.  I really was concerned about the quality of food in this place, but things vastly improved once the hot dishes moved in. The lamb hot pot was extremely flavourful, and there were glistening chunks of lamb brisket with potatoes and Chinese celery. The spicy chicken was fried perfectly, and the wok air was unbelievable. The lamb noodles provided a necessary and soothing contrast to the two hot dishes. It came with lots of lamb (I had a whole piece of lamb tendon which was delightfully chewy) and a decent amount of veggies (Napa cabbage and fungi/wood ear).  The meal was quite delightful, but fairly pricey. I think the trick to this place is to order spicy dishes, or those that are predominantly lamb based."}
{"text":"The food was okay but not satisfying for the price point. They are situated in a plaza full of other great Chinese food options that give you a more satisfying meal for the money."}
{"text":"I wanted to take my parents to try our new fav Pho place, but when we got there, they were closed for a private party. So my mom  said let's try Mr.Gao's.  It's not bad, I would certainly recommend to try it.  Inside is very nice and clean. There is 1 room for bigger/private parties which is nice. Open kitchen.  We had a variety of foods to try Skewers, soups, dumplings, noodles, and they were all enjoyable.  If anything, 1,2 items tasted too salty.  The service was good. When we were ordering juices for the kids, he made sure we knew what was store bought and what was fresh and we were ok with it."}
{"text":"Service sucks?Server can't remember the name of dish"}
{"text":"We passed by this place a few times, and eventually decided to pay for a visit. It's a chained restaurant. Based on some reviews and friends' comments, the other locations are pretty good, but this one is not as good as the others.  Without putting the objective opinions from others, we ordered some rice noodles, bbq eggplants and shrimps to have different scopes of the cooking styles to evaluate.   The rice noodles here are not making too much sense for us since there are dagu noodles and yun close by. There are so many artificial crab sticks and a couple of shrimps in the house special noodles. The taste of it is just strongly hot and spicy, not flavourful at all. The beef rice noodles have no highlight either, the soup base is very plain. On the other side, the BBQ eggplants and shrimps are very tasty, and the price for the dishes is very competitive.   Overall, the experience here is on average."}
{"text":"It was pretty empty when I arrived with my wife at 6pm. The interior design was great but my wife told me it was from the last restaurant that did the interiors. Staff was nice.  The chef can out and suggested the fish bowl so we got that and the lamb noodle pot. Not only did it take forever to get our food, the table of 4 that ordered after us got most of their food before us. Half the time, the chef is walking around socializing.  When the food finally came, the fish dish was pretty tasteless and the lamb dish was not lamb meat, but lamb internals. They need to translate their menu properly into English.  It was pricey for what we got. I rather eat at a fast food chain less than $20 for two people than ordering 2 dishes for over $30 with taxes and tip included.   We won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster, the numbers on the menu and their computer do not match. We were only the second table in the restaurant at that time. Waited for 45 minutes for the food. But the food that came are not the food that was ordered. The waitress did not admit one dish that came was her mistake until the boss came  when we complained. First time here last time here!! There are way better restaurants in saga than this one! Nothing to loss if you don't go! I don't want to give one star but won't let me post this review unless I do so!"}
{"text":"There are 2 doors at the entrance.  I got confused which one to go in lol as we couldn't find any server to help us. One side are for small groups and the other side contained bigger table obviously for bigger groups.  Food was excellent. I didn't take any pictures was too hungry lol.   The bbq lamb and chives bbq were really flavor full. The lamb curry was like a stew meal i thought it was going to be like a masala indian taste but it was a really good stew. Our server was very polite and nice.   Because it's separated sometimes it's hard to call a server back if no one is on your side.  But other than that I love it. Will go back again. Quiet place.  Nice decoration.  Nice ambiance.  There is even like a karaoke  setting at the corner where you can play karaoke."}
{"text":"This is such a great Resturant. Will definitely come back for the oyster bbq again! Loved it. Best oyster ever!"}
{"text":"I like it. Modern menu, a change from traditional Chinese restaurants. Heavy on the oil but overall the taste is great. I suggest to give it a try might, its worth it."}
{"text":"Didn't notice that they recently took over the spot that used to be Acacia. The restaurant had an open kitchen with food displays which were unusual for a Chinese restaurant. You can still see the big stone oven in the kitchen! The interior was decorated nicely but it still doesn't resemble a typical Chinese restaurant or a modern one either.  We ordered the clay pot red pork belly and lamb skewers. It took a while for it to come to the table. We were so disappointed in the dishes as well as service. The braised pork belly was so bland as the soup didn't have any flavour and the dish came with nappa, glass noodles, and tofu... not the best combination of flavour. I think they even forgot to add any salt to the dish. The pork belly itself was so bad, I did expect layers of fat since it is of course pork belly but only a few pieces actually contained meat (in very small amounts). Be prepared to have your arteries clogged!   Service was bad. We had to keep calling them because they forgot about the rice, then our drinks, then chili powder for our skewers, and gave us an extra plate of skewers which we already had."}
{"text":"To be honest, I'll give them 2.5. The decor is simple and it's an open concept seating area. An open kitchen which is rare for a Chinese restaurant. The washroom is clean and spacious so that's a good sign.   Now the bad things...   Even though we ordered first, we saw the two tables of 4 to our left and right got their dishes first. And it was many dishes too!! So we were wondering about our 2 clay pot dish that ended to be a disappointment.   First dish - I think they didn't translate very well to English and we got internal lamb parts into a noodle soup that wasn't spicy at all. The flavour wasn't the greatest. It felt something wasn't too fresh.  Second dish - It was basa fillet with tofu in a bland soup base that turned out more salty as you drank it.   My partner and I didn't enjoy the dinner. We left the pots half full. And I still have room for a bubble tea somewhere else.   Verdict: I wouldn't go back and not sure how they managed to open a second location. How was it possible??"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Their lamb skewers are good! Not that gamey tasting and the seasoning is just right.   We came for their soft opening and it's still really new restaurant because they didn't have a lot of the items on the menu. They came from Hamilton where they had a restaurant there as well.   The food we ordered tasted good and the service was excellent. I especially liked the sweet and sour honey spare ribs and the garlic veggies.   Portion sizes of the clay pots can be big so it's enough to share with two people at least.   Don't be alarmed with the decor though. I think they didn't renovate much after the takeover from the previous restaurant (used to be a middle eastern restaurant) so a lot of the look and feel is very similar to the restaurant previously.   LAST TIP?!  Order the soup noodle dishes in a clay pot if you want a good meal for a good price. For $9.99, the portion size looks decent to either eat alone if you're hungry or share with someone else!"}
{"text":"I have been to a few skewer places in markham/scarb area and what i really like about this restaurant is they dont over do the seasoning.  The meats are juicy, and there soup noodle the broth is light yet flavourful.  Definitely worth a visit, prices are $3 for 2 skewers on avg.    Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"3.5 stars: this place isn't bad. Decided to try this out with a friend and overall left satisfied.    We had a beef brisket clay pot soup and several skewers (beef tendon, pork, beef). The soup was quite tasty and was a good start to the meal - the beef wasn't cooked too much, the veggies were refreshing, and the broth was exactly what I needed on a cold day. The skewers were tasty and quite comparable to other restaurants that serve skewers - basically a lot of cumin but I happen to love the taste of cumin so I don't mind.   They serve a variety of dishes and skewers at quite affordable prices. The skewers average about $1.50 per skewer with the exception of a few items (pork, chicken, and potato I believe) that are slightly cheaper. I recommend that any of the main dishes be shared among the table as they are big and this kind of food is better enjoyed shared. The only flaw is the wait time for food - we were one of maybe 4 tables there and we felt like we waited an unreasonable amount of time for the food."}
