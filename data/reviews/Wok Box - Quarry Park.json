{"text":"As a medically diagnosed celiac, finding good gluten-free restaurants is necessary. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. Sure, they are tasty, I'm willing to spend the extra $ for health(ier) fast-food, they have a nicely marked menu as items that do not contain wheat, and separate pans/tongs for special dietary requirements.  So what's the problem?? Cross-contamination. It's very clear the staff has not been properly educated on food allergies, which is very disappointing because Wok Box is so close to being there! Here's where they disappoint: (1) the separate \"GF\" wok & tongs are crudely scrubbed inbetween uses with the bamboo brush they use to clean all the other, gluten-laden pans, before it's hung back up on the wall (not cleaned properly) and (2) they parboil their veggies to speed up the cooking process in a big pot of water in the centre of the stove, but if you watch closely, they throw in all of their wheat-based noodles into the same water to cook them and there is no separation.  Sadly, I have noticed this at a few Wok Boxes..."}
{"text":"Fast food at good prices and generous portions. I've ordered take out form here countless times - the traditional style take out box is fun to eat out of if you're eating alone, Ive eaten in the restaurant several times as well."}
{"text":"Terrible food, cold veggies, bland tasting followed by runs....do not go here - first and last time."}
{"text":"I ordered the butter chicken combo (regular size) for lunch. The combo came to just around $15 which is fairly steep for individual serving of fast food in my opinion.   The naan did not have the taste or texture of naan and the butter chicken wasn't much better either.   If I were to go back, I'd try another item on the menu."}
{"text":"I love Wok Box. It has great options for everyone, including gluten free and vegans. However, I just don't understand how one can confuse \"tofu\" with \"chicken.\" It is super shitty to stop by quickly after a long day, come home, open my order, and see they have got it wrong. Due to my own dietary choices, I do not eat animal products so this was a total waste of money.Thankfully this has never happened at any other locations, but the restaurants in Quarry Park continue to disappoint."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location a couple times a week for over a year now, and I've never had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and efficient. I appreciate the fact this location offers brown rice as an option too. Thanks Wok Box Quarry Park"}
{"text":"I work closely so I eat here often. I absolutely love the Vietnamese Pho. The Firecracker is also good if you're looking for something a bit spicier. The atmosphere is nice and they even have outdoor seating in the summer. The food tastes good and I would say generally, quality is better than other fast food restaurants. If you're looking for a quick lunch, this little place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"I have seen Wok Box`s around for awhile, but never actually tried one until it moved within the proximity of my home.  I have tried Wok Box about four times since it moved into my stomping grounds, and it has never disappointed me.  I have tried a number of dishes, and they are always fantastic at making them a little extra spicy for me when asked.  I also like that there is a \"low carb\" option.  You can have your dish on a bed of vegetables instead of rice.  Excellent!  The staff have always been friendly, and the first time I went in, they gave me a tour of the menu, which was quite helpful for me.  I'm no stranger to Asian food, but it was nice to have someone take the time to make some recommendations, based on my spicy palate.  I have done both take out and eat-in service at this location and I will continue to go back.  Its definately a small step up from fast food asian, but the food is consistently good. With their low carb option, this is a healthy option for me compared to some of the other choices in my area."}
{"text":"Ive been to this place afew times because its decently close to my house.  Mainly the food being served is rice bowls and they really aren't anything special.  My family and I used to go to a place called banzai that served rice bowls for around the same price.  After eating at Banzai this place really isn't satisfying at all I found it really disappointing.  I have had a couple experiences here that weren't good.  One time I purchased a noodle bowl here and it was scalding hot and I had to wait about 10 minutes for it to cool off to reasonable temperature for consumption.  Food should not be given to a customer at a temperature way to hot to eat when people buy fast food they want it to be ready to eat as soon as its given to them.  Another problem I had just yesterday when I was there me and my girlfriend walked into the resteraunt  and we were waiting at the front of the resteraunt while the employee that was there was busy working in the back.  We didn't want to come across as impatient so we just waiting expecting that she would be out serving us in a reasonable amount of time.  We waited for  about 10 minutes until we finally said something.  A place like this has no excuse for being this inattentive to there customers ,there should always be someone at the cash register ready to take  peoples orders especially because this place isn't busy very often it should be easy to serve the few people that come in.  I give this place 2 stars because how they've served me in the past has been annoying but there food is ok even though ive had much better."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and a pretty standard Wok Box experience. On my latest visit the food seemed to take a little longer than usual, but its all cooked to order so I don't mind the extra wait."}
