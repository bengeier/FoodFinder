{"text":"Loved the old school camp theme, rooftop view and fire pits, the ambiance spot on! Had a burger (delicious), Horseradish bloody (also delicious) and an adult pouch drink, I think it was called the Sconnie Punch? or something like that..it was decent, quite boozy. We came in a group of about 6 with one kid and were able to eat our meals and keep her entertained at the same time. The plentiful supply of board games is perfect for kids and adults!"}
{"text":"The food and aesthetic here are seriously incredible, fair prices, amazing food, friendly staff, and it feels so cozy and welcoming and nostalgic! the spaghetti and meatballs and sweet potato fries were KILLER"}
{"text":"Really great burger. Usually I don't like special sauce, and would have asked for it to be held or put on the side if I had noticed it on the menu, but it was excellent. 

Sweet potatoe fries were more like wedges, but were well cooked and the dipping sauce was great. 

There is no wait staff, as you order from the bar and receive a pager which lights up to signal you to collect your food. 

Patio is super neat for the evening or on cooler days. 

There are board games to play, but we noticed a lot of them are missing pieces, rendering them useless."}
{"text":"Came to this place for my sister's birthday. We found it on Yelp after being a little lost on by the waterfront. The service at the bar was great! They made awesome drinks, and the bug juice is super yummy. We didn't get food, but we did see others with the s'mores packets. The decor is fun, it's definitely campground themed, and the Inside reminds me of an old rental cabin. There were some games to play while enjoying the drinks and view, we played giant Uno. Overall, great time!"}
{"text":"hey guys its kevin mawby, you guys treat me very well. 5 stars!!!! see you round 4-5. have an old fashioned ready extra smoky"}
{"text":"Came for the first time during Madison Burger week with my wife and kids. Both my wife and I ordered the \"back to school burger.\" Was very good! Cooked perfectly. No kids menu so we just ordered an appetizer for my daughter...nachos, were very good...she loved them. Bar tender and cook we very nice and helpful. Have cool homemade adult juice box drinks that taste great. Service was very good. We spilled our drinks right after we got them and the bartender replaced them at no cost...something that was not expected but very kind. Awesome rooftop view is a huge plus. We will definitely be back whether it is for drinks, food or both"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about CT - most of them good! 

Starting with the negative: 
1. Their veggie options are quite expensive. For example, my favorite item to order is the Impossible Burger*. Though I LOVE that burger, it only comes with cheese (no vegan option), lettuce and a special sauce. No side options - you have to order those a la carte, sadly. So by the end of the meal, you've spent a pretty penny. If only they'd give combo options! The Avocado Grain Bowl is $13, which I'm happy to pay. But when you look at the veggie options in comparison to the non veggie options, it almost feels like you're being punished for trying to eat healthy! And this is not specific to CT- it's something i notice at many restos. Ah well! I'm still a fan!

Positive:
1. They get customer service right! At one point, it was not mentioned on the menu that the Impossible Burger came with cheese. Seeing as I'm lactose intolerant, I ended up having to call to request a reorder (since the cheese was melted onto the burger). They were so apologetic and so accommodating. They personally delivered the new burger, even though they could have asked their delivery service to make that delivery. So kind! 

2. The fact that they have a vegan burger is so cool. They are one of two restaurants in Madison that the Impossible Burger- kudos to them! 

*3. if you don't know what the Impossible Burger is:  https://www.impossiblefoods.com/burger/

4. Their sweet potato fries are so bomb. Seriously, try them! 

Bon apetite!"}
{"text":"I heard of Camp Tripalindee from the Eater food map. From a food perspective, I'd give it 4 stars. The chicken sandwich is deliciously moist and crispy. The kimchi slaw keeps it moist and interesting. They have a lot of toppings, so you get really creative with your sandwiches. The fries are ok. They're nothing amazing, but they taste the way fries should taste. I would stay away from the nachos. While they're one of the more interesting appetizers, I found them to be pretty bland. It was basically a light walking taco with blue corn tortilla chips.

Camp Tripalindee earns 5 stars from me because of its concept and atmosphere. It's that cool. When you first get to the entrance downstairs, there's a sign stating their dedication to inclusion. I'm down with that. Past the door, you'll see a lot of camping and lake decorations and an elevator. The elevator can only take you to the 7th floor where the restaurant is located. Once you get to the 2nd floor, you'll see people hanging out on a rooftop with drinks, roasting s'mores on open flames. Just past the rooftop shenanigans is the bar. I get 70s diner vibes from the inside, but that's probably an inaccurate description since I was born in the 90s. There are plenty of comfy seats, and you order all your food and drinks from the bar. It's so chill. I find the place to be so relaxing and inviting while also providing good food and drinks. The Wisconsin summer camp theme is so clever too.

Camp Tripalindee is great place to eat and/or drink if you love summer time. You'll feel like a kid at summer camp and a hipster at the same time."}
{"text":"A straight up bar and a fun place to hangout with friends, but it's not a restaurant and there is absolutely zero table service. Everything is ordered at the bar, you pick it up, you bus it and it's pretty clear that they are more focused on making drinks and not making food. Our food took forever and it was just okay. 

We all had burgers which were pretty good, but for $9 I was expecting more from my burger. The crinkle cut fries were done well...crispy, seasoned and it was a generous portion. 

The sweet potato fries though were a complete miss; cut too large, mushy in the middle and just not good. The only good thing I can say about them was the chipotle mayo that came with them was delicious.

The dinner winner were the cheese curds. Perfectly breaded and the jalape√±o ranch had enough kick for most but wasn't overpowering.

Great theming and the interiors are on point from the elevator lobby to the bathroom. It really transports you and it is what makes this bar.

I also want to add that if you care about the environment then maybe this isn't the place for you. All the food comes in disposable containers, plastic silverware, individual packets of condiments, and the single use adult juice box cocktails that come in the equivalent of an IV bag with a bendy straw. So much plastic and so much waste. I hope they at least recycle the glass soda bottles."}
{"text":"What a cool rooftop dive bar! Came here for lunch during a conference in Madison. Ordered some fried cheese curds (when in Rome...) and a brat. Both were pretty good; I really liked the dill dip that came with the cheese curds. Board games and games of the 80s-90s strewn about the place along with the flannel wall paneling really brings you back to the summer camp vibes. If I ever came back here I'd love to come back for drinks at night-the view is awesome from here."}
{"text":"So much fun and it's great to have an outdoors rooftop bar downtown. The interior seating is very camp-like, there are boardrooms lots of fun wall art. The outside area is more lounge-like with padded benches, stringed Edison-bulb lights and a fire pit. 

Views of the lake are enjoyed from a few tables and booths inside, the outdoor area faces downtown.

Didn't order any food but there are fun, classic items to enjoy. We did get the root beer floats made with Sprecher's and they were great. Drink prices are slightly premium, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"really enjoyed our visit.  We had the nachos, old fashioned, and spicy margarita + made s'mores on the deck.  Loved the camp games available to play, the decor, the guests and the staff.  YAAAASSSS."}
{"text":"Coming across Camp Trippalindee felt like discovering an amazing secret. I'm not sure how this retro summer camp restaurant/bar has been open for so long without tons of reviews and people raving about it. Maybe we should keep it a secret??

First off, the setting of the Graduate Hotel is gorgeous and sets the stage as soon as you enter. The retro lobby setup starts to take you back in time, and by the time you make it upstairs to Camp Trippalindee you've been transported to a 70s/80s summer camp! I love the way that they went all out with the decor. You can sit and then order at the counter... The service was a bit slow at the bar, but the food was up quickly once the orders were placed.

The menu has a good selection and is not overwhelmed with choices. There are basics, like yummy-looking burgers and cheese curds with spicy ranch, and also unique options, like the flavorful and filling avocado grain bowl with farro. I loved having the option to splurge or go healthy, and thought the prices were reasonable as well. 

As far as drinks, there are several beers on tap but the adult boozy Capris (Capri Sun style) really caught my eye! Even if you're not in the mood for an adult bev, check out the clever drink names on the menu (again, they didn't slack staying on theme), and then choose from their selection of non-alcoholic drinks like Wisco Pop and Sprecher's. 

If the weather's nice, how can you not sit outside? The patio is gorgeously furnished and the fire pits add a lot to the camp theme. Especially if you pick up a $4 s'mores kit. You will end up making friends as you share a fire pit with some neighbors to roast marshmallows and curl up with the blankets that are also provided by Camp Trippalindee! The root beer floats look amazing as well. I can't wait to be back at Camp and relax out on the patio where the Capitol peeps out in the distance. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Crimey cripes, this place is fantastic. I'd be more elaborate, but I've already said enough."}
{"text":"This place was pretty darned cool. Totally enjoyed hanging out here and will definitely return. 

Outdoor seating - fire-pits, amazing views, nicely decorated and cool lighting .. Inside - super throwback style but done absolutely perfectly. It's like walking into your great uncle's suburban ranch home before everything got worn out. I loved it! 

Board games at almost every table - chess, checkers, Uno, Battleship, Jenga, etc. 

We started outside. I thought it was super cool they had a water dish set out for doggos. This place is dog friendly- awesome! The terrace area is pretty large and seats quite a few. Really enjoyed it and the awesome views were just the cherry on top. It started raining (booo) so we relocated to the inside. 

Sat a table that had oversized Jenga and immediately decided to play. Super intense game! Meanwhile service was great, bartenders cleaning up around us, checking on us, everyone in general having a nice time. 

They have these Capri-sun style drink bags that come with green juice stuff in them. I didn't order one myself, but one in my group did, and holy cow it was yummy! Definitely will give you gut-rot if you have too many, but at least one is a must. Yum!! 

The one and only complaint I have (and it's only a half complaint, really) is the restroom situation. They have two gender-neutral restrooms that are both nice, well stocked, and clean. Love it. HOWEVER.. there are only two. I had a pretty long wait both times I needed to use the facilities. It wasn't *super* busy in the bar at either time, so I can only imagine what it's like when they are truly packed. I love that they aren't gender specific, and I love that they are big with real doors as opposed to stalls, but when ya gotta go, ya gotta go - and the wait was definitely annoying.

Other than that, though, I really have nothing bad to say about the place. I'm a fan!"}
