{"text":"The photo of the burger looks nothing like what you get; very disappointing. You pay a premium for a  suppossedly quality juucy burgers; but instead what you get is a thin burger which looks pretty pathetic. The fries are burnt and they give you lots of condimemts, but ultimately, you want a good burger and all you get is a pathetic looking burger. Even the hot dog stand on the street does a better burger. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED. This ia my 2nd time trying Hero Burgers, just to give them the benefit of the doubt since my 1st experience at another location in Mississauga on Britinnia and Credit View was equally as dsappointing. Well, I am done woth hero burgers, I am not getting ripped off again."}
{"text":"I really want to love Hero's Burgers. I admire their standards on animal welfare and emphasis on healthy, hormone and antibiotic free meat. Some people complain about their prices, but, for me, it's worth paying the extra $s for traceable, good quality meat....

...Unfortunately, the bottom line for me is that their food just doesn't taste good enough! I'd love to be able to say that the thick, potatoey fries and the hormone-free, ethically raised meat tastes much better than McDonalds or Burger King, but - for me - it really doesn't. Even when I completely personalise my burger with all my favourite toppings (bacon,fried egg, carmelised onions, ketchup) and season my fries exactly the way I want them, everything still tastes completely bland - dare I say tasteless. 

I thought my first visit was a blip, as I wasn't feeling the greatest that day, but my second visit left me with the exact same thoughts. 

It's a shame, because I admire the company a lot, but what's the point in paying $13 for a lunch combo I'm not going to enjoy .."}
{"text":"Probably the best gluten free burger bread I've ever had. That's a start. Fresh toppings, thick but bland patty that still made for a decent burger. 

The poutine was also reliable, curds and a chemical yet tasty gravy. Fries a bit cold. Nothing spectacular, yet just as good as any traditional poutine you'd find at the average \"shack a patates\" east of the border. I liked it.

Unfortunately, I had to wait about 20 minutes to get my burger as they were clearly understaffed around lunch break. If it hadn't been for that, I would easily give them 4 stars."}

It was pretty busy as all the office workers came out of their cubicles and oozed into the Food Court of 100 Wellington West. Hero Burger was definitely one of the longer lines. The service was quick. I got my burger with mustard, jalape√±o peppers, red onion (I hope I have gum before I go back to te office... Probably should've thought of that... Oops!), and  spring mix. Thy were a little stingy in the spring mix!  As all Hero burgers are made from 100% angus beef the burger was very tender and juicy (unlike the tough, cardboard ones you get from the various fast food giants around Toronto). The thing that really made the burger for me, however, was the seaame bun that it was served on. Absolutely delish! 

Can't comment on the fries yet as I decided that having those would put me into napping mode. Don't think the boss would like that too much!"}
{"text":"I went back to Hero Burger on Wednesday and feel that after having Craft, Burger Bar and Gourmet Burger, it just doesn't measure up. It's still good but not burgasm worthy. Service was still good though so it only loses 2 stars for me."}
{"text":"A friend and I met for lunch and the friend felt like burgers and I went along. 

We both had veggie burgers, fries, onion rings and bottles of water for about $24 all in. We were a bit early for the lunch rush hour. We were told that veggie burgers take about five minutes and we were OK. 

My first at Hero and was disappointed. The burger it self was good, the whole wheat buns were OK. The toppings stacked but not much. The burger to bun ratio wasn't great. The buns a bit smaller. 

The fries  and onion rings were totally awful. Just too greasy. At every bite the first thing that you tasted was oil. Too greasy - way too greasy. We both could not finish. 

Value for money 2/5
Burger 3.5/5
Fries/Onion Rings 1/5
 
Harvey's has way better fries and Burgers for a fantastic price point."}
{"text":"Providing some of the best tasting burgers (beef and veggie) and chicken breasts I've ever tasted, Hero Burger definitely surpasses the taste found at most fast food franchises like McDonalds and Burger King by more than a mile. With fresh food, a wide selection of toppings, and great service, this location at the TD Center in downtown Toronto recently catered a holiday lunch held by my company.  The numerous accolades for service, taste, and quality I received from my co-workers simply had to be documented on Yelp so that customers can be made aware of the amazing experience my group had.  Make sure to request their 'hero sauce' on your sandwich. It's amazing! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"They use really high quality beef for thier burgers. The buns could be better tho"}
{"text":"A Hero Burger has a large patty that should not be confused with any premium beef patty anywhere.  While the toppings are a bit better than the average burger joint, the overall burger is greasy and leaves you feeling like \"I could've eaten Wendy's for less and been just as happy\" or \"For a buck or two more, I could've had Burgers Priest\"."}
{"text":"The burgers I am trying everywhere more and more often feel like inferior meat. It seems to be constantly getting lower and lower quality meat. I can tell because I don't put much on my burgers. This is one of those places giving out inferior meat. Still tastes ok but definitely not grade A beef."}
{"text":"I like anyplace with a lot of options. Lots of condiments and cheese options for a dollar. And it is good but not to die for."}
