{"text":"Two words: Liquor. Combo.  Formerly Harubang, Toong's is the place to go if you want to get a decent meal and get sh*tfaced in the process. When you go to Toong's, don't bother opening the menu, flip it over and go straight to the liquor combos. You get to choose a dish (usually a massive sharing sized dish) for under $20 and it comes with 5 beers or a bottle of soju! That alone would cost you $20 anywhere else! Now multiply that by all of your friends with you and well... you get the picture.  Not only that, you get all of the little banchan dishes and if you're drunk enough, they'll actually start bringing you little dishes of food that you didn't even order for free (butter corn, sausages, Korean pancakes, etc.)!  My favourite dish on the menu is Chicken. Yup, I can't read the 20 Korean words on the menu that describe this dish, but the English translation is simply \"chicken\". It's a sweet and spicy fried Korean chicken dish that goes great with beer. If you can't read Korean, you'd probably just gloss over that item, but trust me, it's really good!  Parking is in the back and you can enter through the back of the restaurant which is pretty hilarious because you'll see patrons on the other side of the restaurant waiting for tables too! Anyways, if you're in the Yonge/Finch area with a bunch of friends, check it out for good times!"}
{"text":"Never coming back here again. The service was okay, it wasn't the waitress's fault we had a horrible experience, but what in the world do you guys ACTUALLY have that's on the menu? Not even kidding, we ordered about 3-4 different times because every time we ordered something that was on the menu they would come back to us 10 minutes later and tell us it's not available. So after the 3rd attempt at ordering food, this is what went down:  Me:  \"What do you mean it's not available? It's on the menu, just like the last 3 dishes we ordered!! Okay fine, forget about the food, give us a bottle of Charm Soju\"  (waitress comes back 5 minutes later looking rather nervous) Waitress: Ummmm... we're REALLY sorry but we're out of Charm Soju too. However, we'll give you *unknown* soju, on the house\"  Guy at our table: \"WHAT? Are you toying with us?! Thanks for trying but I think we've wasted enough time here. Goodbye.\""}
{"text":"I went to Toong for the first time since it changed it name from Harubang. The menu seemed good, the place was really nice with Korean music, and Korean soap on TV. I was there with my mother's friend and since it was her first time to have Korean food, I am glad that us being there was a successful event. She had pork cutlets with a sweet sauce, rice and veggies. I had bulgogi soup. Kind and efficient service, good food, variation in side dishes and even the starter salad was really nice and fresh. It just was a bit warm there... I hope their AC was just off."}
{"text":"Toong is a table top cooking and sharing type of place popular for it's booze n food combos.  A blustery frigid night calls one to Toong for a good warm up.   Its not my first choice for kam ja tang (pork bone soup - that oh so proletarian deliciousness),  but they do a fine job of it.  I got lucky this night as my searing hot bowl was filled with tender chunks of pork more than bone.   Very satisfying."}
