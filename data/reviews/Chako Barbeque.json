{"text":"Expect the worst service ... it's so packed and understaffed .... you would do better going to other Korean all u can eat places"}
{"text":"The bee short ribs are marinated with amoratic flavor and the texture is juicy and chewy. But it is my routine to use it to wrap proteins( strongly recommend you guys to try it),thus, lacking of lettuce is a HUGE turn down for me. Over all, foods severed here are good if not excellent."}
{"text":"Food here isn't bad. However service was terrible the last time I came. The place was only about 1/3 full, yet it took forever to get someone's attention. Also, when we did reach their attention and asked for something, they just went and got it without saying a word.  I would recommend the Scarborough location over this one."}
{"text":"For starters, we visited Chako as a group of individuals (eight persons) and the wait staff didn't ask for our order for nearly a half hour. They ignored our side of the table when asking for drink choices, and had to be reminded 3 times before our drinks were brought to us nearly an hour after we sat down. The food was average, but it's to be expected for the price. The wait staff was nowhere to be seen for a good majority of our stay. Empty plates were left sitting, glasses sat unfilled. Our waitress was rude to us before we left because we refused to tip her for  the unsatisfying experience. We complained to the manager and he brushed us off with little care. I have no reason to recommend this place after the terrible and unpleasant experience we last had there. If you're only aiming to acquire AYCE Korean bbq on a budget and don't care for terrible service or average quality food, you might not mind visiting Chakos. Not recommended."}
{"text":"One of my favourite AYCE Korean BBQ Joints! Selections of meats are great (especially the Chako Ribs that are only available on weekends) and the marinade they use on them are amazing! The atmosphere is awesome - it's a loud and fun. Service is decent and fast. Overall, a good place to fill up on BBQ meats! Definitely try out if you haven't already - highly recommended! I think I'm gonna stop by there tonight, YUM!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. The waiters wakes straight past us on a Friday night.... For was good but the beef broke apart. Wasn't sure about the salmon... It didn't seem that fresh."}
{"text":"Typical AYCE Chinese run Korean barbecue place. Servers brought stacks of square dishes containing your meats, seafood and veggies for you to cook on your own. I found this place to be pricier than the Korean barbecue places you can find at commerce gate, with pretty much the same mains selection.   The only thing that really stood out would be their mango and red bean puddings, and their  Option for grilled pineapple. However, the puddings only come with the \"weekend menu\" which WARNING includes Friday night! The only reason I warn you is because they did not tell us that we would be charged that price initially, so we didn't order as many weekend menu items until approximately half way through our meal!"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. NEVER AGAIN. If you're looking for decent food....NEVER GO HERE!! Waste of money, waste of time, and a disgrace to Asian cuisine. Can they even call this food?? For $21 a person, everything tasted nasty...can't even manage to finish a plate of meat...can't finish a scoop of ice cream... and the pudding...don't even....ughhh Please....I'm doing you a huge favour right now! Don't go! You'll regret it for life!!! Plain rice would be better than eating here...The meat was bad, the sushi was terrible, the desserts were awful... Everything seemed awful just when they bring out the mini dishes...it's a sign of future regret...THEIR SOYA BEANS AND TOFU AND BEANSPROUTS LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE PREPARED 5 DAYS AGO....WHAT IS THIS??? Spend $26 and you can get 10x better quality at Ten-Ichi (for BUFFETS only)... I don't understand how people can give this more than one star!!! If you still want to come, go ahead...but you must have never tasted decent food before to say this even tastes okay...or even tasted food before.....you must be starving for days to think this even tastes okay... NEVER AGAIN. WHAT IS THIS? AND NO, I'M NOT BEING HARSH; THIS REVIEW IS AS HONEST AS ANYTHING, come for yourself and you will understand...perhaps you will even say that this review puts everything mildly!"}
{"text":"A very nice place to go for barbeque. I considered this the best barbeque restaurant that I've tried so far. The price is fair. there are several side dishes options, and meat options. I specially like the vege section.  However, this place has reduced their meat selection in the last 2 year. I remember that two years ago, they had bacon strips!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love those!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an AUTHENTIC Korean experience, this is not the place to go. This is a disgrace to Korean food. Ok ok, I am a bit biased - I lived in Korea for 3 years. The sauce is lacking, the kimchi is sweet (err?!...) and it just breaks my heart and makes me miss Seoul that much more.   However if all you are looking for is to eat a pile of meat, this place isn't so bad. Although I agree with others - the service is lacking, you have to pretty much get them while you can and order whatever you think you'll need otherwise, good luck finding them! The servers also lack personality which can make or break your night depending on what you're there for! :)"}
{"text":"The place is good but your clothes end up smelling like meat from the smoke  #badventilation"}
{"text":"Love it ! So worth the money, if you are a big eater like myself. I always come before the cutoff because sometimes they do not service sushi after 10PM Or something of that sort. The staff are good they check on you enough that you don't need to wait for more food. Make sure you have reservations! waiting to get in is atleast 10-15 minutes ."}
{"text":"Staff is very rude there. All young high school kids are working there and they give you looks. They never come back to your table once they laid your food out on the table. There are better Korean bbq places around. not recommending this place."}
{"text":"KBBQ is more of an experience I believe and it was fun! Been to a few spots like this, this one is quite clean, neat, comfortable seating booths and tables for larger parties. Half the place was unused tables so it should accommodate on any busy night. Cute simple Christmas decorations Waitresses were constantly passing my table so didn't have a problem with service it was good, I guess they were stressed so they weren't looking very happy, tried to make one laugh but didn't work... Their tea cups are wicked, made of stone Oh yeah we had all you can eat (family) Foods tasty  Favorite is cold dish raddish Then we just got chicken, beef, calamari, shrimps, ribs Couple bowls of rice ... It was delicious  The inside got very smokey it was as if the place was burning down but it was fun. We were going straight home though so smelling like a BBQ for the rest of night wasn't a problem for us :)   3 ppl $80"}
{"text":"oo la la!  This is the most sleek & modern Korean BBQ place I have ever been to! Imagine beautiful chestnut seating, high-backed chairs and a divider w/ lit up coals to help set the tone.  I came by here to satisfy my Korean food craving and was surprised to discover that they were featuring an All You Can Eat dinner! I almost shrieked w/ delight when I was informed. So, of course I ordered as many things as I pleased: Short Ribs, Teriyaki Chicken, Spicy Salmon Roll (the place is owned by Japanese folk), Red Peppers, Zucchinis, Kimchi, Beansprouts, Radish, Somen Noodles, Miso Soup, Salad, Rice and lastly, Mango Ice-Cream. What a feast!   BUT, some things are too good to be true. It seemed like the little side dishes (the radish, beansprouts, kimchi) weren't housemade and had their dishes individually stashed in the back of the fridge until ordered. It makes me appreciate My Tofu House in SF, a lot more now. Either way, the Short Ribs, Chicken, Red Peppers, Zucchini and Mango Ice Cream were all delicious and had me quite satisfied by the end of the meal.  Service was very attentive and the price pretty reasonable at 16 canadian dollars.  I doubt that I'll be back since I rarely come to this area on business, but this place at least did the job for me."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. Came here few months ago with overseas relatives. Food has gone downhill. Meats are now fatty with no flavour. Rolls passed with too much rice and little fish."}
{"text":"Been to this place numerous times, last night would have to change my thoughts on this place. I used to really like this place because it has two of my favorite meals, Korean BBQ and sushi. Their selection of sushi was never the greatest but it was enough to satisfy me along with Korean BBQ. I ordered 2 salmon hand rolls last night, it was mainly rice, like 90% and very small piece of salmon (I am going to post a picture). If you're going advertise yourself as a place that has both, at least put effort into making it a decent quality. If you don't, then take sushi off your menu. Korean BBQ wise, typical things. Please also needs to be more ventilated."}
{"text":"If I could rate it zero stars, I would.  OK, ultra biased perhaps. But let's put it this way:  If you are ready for the typical inexpensive, all you can eat bbq meat fest and appreciate quanity over quality...then this is the place to be!!  100%  Food quality is dismal at best.  The meat was poorly marinated (flavor, anyone?), and quality of the meat itself was sub par.  Call it \"korean bbq\" all you want, but if I was blindfolded and fed the meat, I wouldn't be able to tell.  The only thing korean about this bbq is the korean style table top cooking with marinated meat.  Service as expected, is typical of the inexpensive chinese run establishments--that is, poor.  We tried to get a waitor to get us the bill, and he replied back saying he was going to eat his dinner.  Really?  That's fine, but don't go walking in the dining room when you can be flagged down during your break.  Coles notes:  1) Lots of food, relatively inexpensive + a sushi menu to boot! 2) Low quality--I'd call this fast food standards (if that) 3) It's not so much a lack of service, but poor service and attitudes held by more than 1 of the wait staff 4) 2 hour eating time limit!  You are at all you can eat, slowly cooking your meat.  Better make it a race if you're hungry!"}
{"text":"Great food. Always come here for the late night special! Price is right and the service is quick. For 15 bucks all you can eat meat I will take it any day. Hot sauce and bean sprouts with rice complete my meal."}
{"text":"Grade D level meat at best. Party of 6 all felt ill. Never going back. Ever."}
{"text":"I don't usually complain but this is horrible in this place.  The servers take your order just listen to what you say.  They don't record and so many times it misses something.  It was a Friday night but not even 20% fill up in the restaurant.  If you want sushi, this is NOT a place for it. At last we ordered deserts,  the servers (honestly I don't know what language they can understand) simply nob her head and didn't say anything.  Only 20% came back and missing the others.  Asked and asked and finally notice one thing we ordered was not available on that night.  Food is ok,  air ventilation is poor,  services is terrible."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, they didn't give us enough change so we asked for it but then they accused our friend of not paying when she clearly did, later realized that they made a mistake and didn't even apologize about it. Now they are currently arguing with us about it, refusing to give us back the right change. The server then had audacity to talk shit about my friends and I in Cantonese while we all understood what they were saying."}
{"text":"It's either you love it or hate. Let me first state that the service was terrible. Whenever me and my group of friends needed assistance or to ask for more food, the waiters and waitresses had their back towards us all of the time.   The food wasn't even good, or even decent for that matter. The all you can eat menu had a bit of variety especially during dinner, however the meats were all too bland and the spices tasted funky leaving a weird after taste. The rosemary steak looked quite good, but was a disappointment as there was too much oregano. The last thing to order was the sushi, and of course it wasn't good and not to mention it didn't even looked appetizing. It was rolled half assed, and was mostly rice and no actual filling.  Regardless, it  wasn't enjoyable, the service is bad, and can't really roll a sushi right to begin with. But I suppose you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this place. Yes the decor is nicer than most KBBQ places, but the food is subpar by far.    There are two problems with the meats: first, the cuts are too thick; the meats (especially the short ribs) need to be smaller and THINNER; the thin cuts of meat have a better surface area to grill ratio for in table cooking, which is critical for KBBQ; second problem is flavor; all the meats didnt have a rich, deep flavor i usually associate with KBBQ self grill meats.   The gold standard for me has always been Korean Grill House, to which i have been going for over 15 years. The food at this place is nowhere near the quality of KGH.   I went back to this place a second time, to give them a chance, and was utterly disappointed again. I will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"(Writing this review while at the restaurant).   Sunday afternoon (12pm) celebrating a birthday with approximately 20+ people. I waited for over 30 minutes for a Coke. Fed up, I asked them to cancel the order and remove it from the bill. 2 minutes later they bring it to the table. I told them I no longer wanted it and they took it away with attitude. From then on very bad service from the staff, ignoring our tables and getting our orders wrong.   We paid the bill and asked them to provide ice cream to a couple tables where guests did not get any. Staff said ok and disregarded. The restaurant wasn't even a quarter full so I attribute it as really bad service overall. Lazy staff.   Food is ok, it is what it is (for a lunch AYCE). Drinks are extra ($1.00 for tea). Selection isn't the best (see below):  -Miso soup, steamed rice, salad -Fried tofu, kimchi, radish, bean sprout -Sliced beef, short rib, chicken, pork, calamari, fish fillet -Greed and red pepper, zucchini -Green tea and mango ice cream  I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Been to chakos I few times and the food is good, very filling. It's a good place to go especially for it being all you can eat for less than 20$. I have had a few not so well mannered servers. Some 'forget' stuff and what not. Tonight tho, I went with a few friends of mine, and we found that the service was excellent, Rain, I believe was his name and I hope I'm not mistaken because he was awesome, Took care of us. Everything was brought to us at once. We didn't have to ask for anything.  It was an excellent time."}
{"text":"this place is alright. I still prefer korean grill house or the chako in brampton over this location.  Service- decent 3/5  food- average korean grill house food, just better selection than most 3.5/5  the thing that bothers me so much about this location is the lack of ventilation..... every time i come here i leave the place with my clothes smelling like i just rescued someone from a burning building.  overall i wouldn't come out of my way for this place, but if I'm in the area and craving it then whatever i'll still eat it"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the food. For better or worse, the chicken and short ribs are cut thick. It looks better but it means that it takes a lot longer to cook than at places where those meats are cut thing. The pork and beef slices are about what you'd expect.  Service can be great when you can get a hold of someone. After we were able to get someone's attention the food came fast.  More veggie selections (pineapple, zuchini, red and green peppers, and mushrooms) help make you feel less guilty. Beware the bowls of rice are very big so order accordingly.  So why did I knock this down to 2 stars? I don't now if their HVAC was broken but as soon as you walk in, there is a smokey haze above the tables. The haze did not move. I know that you'll smell like KBBQ after going there but this was next level stuff and is far worse than I remember from previous visits to Chako."}
{"text":"Over priced and poor quality of meat. poor service. It is run by Chinese not Korean. Very tight seated dining room."}
{"text":"Great fun for date night especially open late. I may be biased because my usual ambassador is a regular and spoiled by the staff.   Food is great, the night time selection is smaller, but the curry chicken and short ribs are awesome.   I love the veggies and glad to see there is no limit to the kimchi and the radishes.   The decor is really nice, which adds a little elegance to a fun night. Admittedly when all is said and done, you need to find a shower to wash off the smell of meat, but you'd have to do that if you grilled at home, right?  I love it when the meat cravings hit, the prices are really amazing especially if you take into consideration the time savings and skipping the dishes"}
{"text":"Food is not bad -Slow Service -Man that answers the phone is extremely rude.  Mississauga location is much better"}
{"text":"We went to this Place for late night All you can eat. But the server charge us on the regular all you can eat price which is $6.00 difference compare to the late night all you can eat. But that's ok since the regular price includes OX tongue which my friend very enjoyed. The service was so so.   I gave it a three stars because their exhaust hoods are very weak. If there's more than 6 tables  inside the whole restaurant is filled with smoke. It's like you went into a giant smoking room.   The service charge(10%) is included with the bill."}
{"text":"The Positive: Being my first time trying a Korean BBQ restaurant, the atmosphere was pretty cool. I enjoyed being able to grill right within my own personal booth. The food came out fresh; definitely loved the grilled calamari and short ribs.  The Negative: The service at this establishment was atrocious. The wait staff seemed as if I was the bane of their existence each time I had to ask for common items: Soup? Probably need a spoon. Beverage? A refill would be nice. Extra napkins? I can't get by one 1, single ply napkin for my entire lunch. I wish I would have known I could have had a grill change. Probably something to communicate to a first timer, as my grill was, to be expected, very charred.    The owner/manager was very rude and displeased to see me walk in, as I was dressed in sweats (just landed in Toronto). I am sorry, but your establishment is incredibly far from Oxford and Blazer worthy.   Overall: Service: 1 of 5 Food: 4 of 5 Ambience: 3.5 of 5 Likelihood I will be back: Do Not Hold Your Breath."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my mother and grandmother for lunch and it was fantastic the service was great and the food was even better. the seasoning was really tasty and I really liked the variety of the food. The only thing I would warn people about is it a little smokey"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Korean BBQ, I had a great time. You get TONSSSSS of food there is no possible way your belly is empty by the end of the night. There is one that tastes awful (I think it's the tongue) but if you avoid that dish your bound to have a great meal. The marinade on the meat was good too, not too salty, a nice bbq flavour. The addition of pinapple was great in my opinion because I like it in my chinese food.  The service is very attentive, our grill cauight on fire (twice) and they rushed to the rescue. It was nicely decorated for the holidays, but the washrooms are the oddest thing ever. You walk in and it's one large room with a bunch of doors. Behind each door is a full washroom, weird.  The price is a big steep but for the amount of meat you consume I guess it's worth it.  I'm always in love with the mango icecream and they had mango pudding too that night..highly recommended!! I'll go back."}
{"text":"It is such a special night with lots of people.  We round up the whole aisle.  We have a group deal that includes all non-alcoholic drinks and of course AYCE Korean BBQ.  Miso soup is not very salty.  The green salad is fresh but the sauce on top is average.  We have beef tendon, ribs, pork, chicken, shrimp, fish but no salmon, squid, and mussel.  The ribs are the best amongst all.  With the price, it worth the money.  In a good quality Korean restaurant, just a set of ribs for two will cost you $30 - $40.  Here it is AYCE.  We also order the sushi and hand roll.  Although on a Thursday night, the choice is limited but is good enough.  All pops, coffee and tea are included.  Finally we consume lots of ice cream - Mango or Green tea.  It takes time and attention for the BBQ.  Otherwise, the meat will be burnt and leave charcoal on top of the metal plate.  Guests on one of our tables actually are so hungry to wait and put all meats on top of the metal plate suffocating the air flow and the BBQ takes so long.  We ask the restaurant to change for another metal plate and put less meat there and it turns out to be alright.  The service is very good with waiters/waitresses walking around the aisle all the time.  The manager is very friendly and is proactive in suggesting ideas.  He is always within your sight.  One of the consequences after the dinner is the BBQ smell being so well absorbed by the clothes.  No matter where that night you are going, people know you have a BBQ."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Decor: 4/5 Atmosphere: 3.5/5  Service: 3/5  Price: meh, 3/5 depending on time, $13-22ish (basically go for the late night or lunch if you want to save money, but go for dinner if you want that extra selection of food)   I'm going to start with the food, cause let's be real that's what we really want to know. Since it's Korean BBQ you have a grill on your table which you use to cook whatever trays of food you order. You have different options for lunch and dinner. IIRC we had a selection of sushi during the weekend dinner.   So the fire's not too hot and cooking your food will take some time. If you're looking at what to get for fast and evenly cooked meat, stick with the beef slices. Ours took about 5 minutes to cook once it got hot enough. Seasonings are good, pretty typical for Korean BBQ. As for the sushi, it's ALRIGHT, nothing stellar, but not terrible (they're also shaped as cubes!! Not that it changes the taste...I think...).   So food is okay, but the experience of cooking your own stuff in your own way is pretty cool. Basically, if you're looking for ridiculously delicious Korean BBQ-  this ain't it. But if you're looking for a fun and different dinner setting, this pretty much fits the bill.   Decor is nice. Nicer than I expected it to be. Like this is definitely a place you can take a date too.   WARNING: Don't wear clothes you A) really don't feel like washing immediately after B) plan on spending the rest of the day with people in. The BBQ smell latches onto your every piece of clothing, I kid you not.   Also on that note, the smell can get pretty intense since they don't really have great ventilation. For the sensitive noses, maybe not a great place.   Atmosphere is good, you're going to want to come here with probably a group of people cause it's so interactive. But like I said, a date would totally work too.  Service was good for the restaurant, but don't expect much. They do their job and get the trays in and out relatively fast, which is really all I need here.   Warning 2: I can be a stupid eater. So if you're like me, DON'T try and pretend you don't need forks and knives to cut the meat. Let's be honest some of this meat has stretchy and difficult to cut ligaments. This is normal, do not start panicking. Just exercise caution because choking...well... it sucks.   Overall I recommend it, but it's not a place I'll be going to allll the time, more of a once in a while with friends place."}
{"text":"I have been to this place tons of times...10+  By far one of the favourties on my list. Great place to have a nice meal with the fun cook-your-food novelty of Korean BBQ.  The price is excellent for the amount of food you can get. I have never had a problem with the service, even on weekends when the place is packed, the servers are still on their game. The servers,routinely refill your drink before it is empty and are always very attentive and friendly.  Great food (nicely seasoned food items), great service and prices, great atmosphere and decor, great for groups.  Overall recommended...Go on the weekends for the extra items available and the sushi is also a plus."}
{"text":"This was a fun meal.  The meat is good and there are quite a few choices for dinner.  Not a huge selection of vegetables, but who needs them?  The tiger shrimp were by far the best.  Marinate them in a little sriracha for a few minutes before grilling and they are great."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars or even half a star I would. We LITERALLY just left the restaurant and I CANNOT believe how poor the customer service was as soon as we stepped foot into the restaurant.   They are not very friendly.   I understand we're cooking our own meat and stuff but it's okay to ask how we're doing or if we need anything.  I asked for a second bowl of rice and the guy would not even look up, I barely got an \"okay\".   And, when we were going to pay for our food, we asked someone else for the bill (since the person who initially took our order was nowhere to be found for the remainder of our meal).  My fiancé had paid and he tore the receipt and threw it at him.  Very rude, the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  Needless to say, we won't ever be coming back and I definitely will not be recommending this location to anyone. Go to the one at McNicoll!"}
{"text":"Omg I'm addicted to this place! The servers are great and take their time to take your order. The and quality of meats is on point! Definitely try it out and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. If you go for the late night special on a weekday (after 10 or 10:30 PM) you can get AYCE for like 11-12$. All of the options on the menu are tasty and well seasoned. They have a great selection of vegetables...my favorites being pineapple an zucchini.   A few tips:   1. If the grill is getting overused you can have them change it for you.  2. it is a really good idea to make reservations because this place can get really busy sometimes."}
{"text":"Very bad rude people, as soon as we got in they told us they close at 12:30am meanwhile I told them their hours are listed at until 1 AM on yelp! They are rude and liars.  Don't go to eat here !!!"}
{"text":"We came in for dinner for 4, they weren't really that welcoming to find out that our bill already included service charge. Our bill was $135 and we gave $140 cash and the waiter said \"okay i'll keep the change, thank you\" had no choice but to just let it go and I was kinda shock and didn't how to react. No wonder the waiters can do whatever they want plus there's not enough ventilation through out the plave so you're basically inhaling pure smoke so..."}
{"text":"So bad, the bbq tables are not working takes 1 hour to make one dish, stupid. Its ridiculous they service is zero, the manager is the worst manager ever."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Chako BBQ Cuisine: Korean/Japanese Location: Richmond Hill Address: 163 York Blvd Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3  Service: 4  Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3  Extra information:  * AYCE Korean BBQ/Sushi * AYCE Lunch/Late night menu avail * Max 2 hour seating  * Takes reservation  I rarely went out for Korean BBQ until I moved to Toronto. AYCE Korean BBQ is so popular in Toronto, almost every corner you turn- you can smell meat! After trying out Korean Grill House couple times, I decided to give Chako a try after I became more so familiar with uptown.  Chako serves Korean BBQ as well as Japanese sushi for lunch, dinner and late night. Me and my friends arrived for dinner on a weekend without reservation and ended up waiting around 40 minutes. Be aware that it gets super smokey inside the restaurant and yes, you will smell like Korean BBQ from head to toe after. To be honest, waiting for 40 minutes in that smokey restaurant almost gave me a headache- my friend and I had to step out for a bit.  We were starving by the time we sat down, so we just ordered almost everything off from their dinner menu (I mean, it is all you can eat...)  All you can eat dinner menu has vegetables, sushi, rolls, meat, seafood and dessert.  For side dishes, they have fried tofu, kimchi, radish, bean sprout and cold noodle. These are all pretty standard and is also served at Korean Grill House. In terms of taste and quality of side dishes, I have to say that it's pretty similar. None of them excellent, but good enough to eat with AYCE BBQ.  For BBQ, we ordered Sliced beef, Ox Tongue, Short Rib, Chicken, Shrimp, Calamari and Fish Fillet (Salmon). My favorites were definitely Short Rib- they were seasoned well (almost a little too well). Shrimps were decent but hard to eat because you have to peel every single one of them.  I didn't find sushi to be anything special- all the rice was kind of warm and I thought that was kind of nasty. For a AYCE place, turnover rate of fish would be fast but I don't think they would use a top quality fish anyways. I skipped most of sushi but tried one of each just to get a taste. Rolls were just standard but had a little too much rice.  Summary: Obviously when you go to AYCE BBQ spots, you don't expect top quality meat to be served. Chako did it's best to serve AYCE BBQ and it did good enough job for me. I don't know if I would go out of my way to choose Chako over Korean Grill House because it is so far plus there isn't much quality/taste difference. If you want cheap Korean BBQ in uptown, check out Chako but make sure to bring febreeze in your car."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for Chako Korean BBQ restaurant. I came here a few times for dinner, however, my husband and I came here for lunch today. For lunch, they don't serve few items like lamb which I really like to have. But it's ok, taste good and plus the price is nice for lunch! Recommend for short ribs, chicken and fish."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely abysmal. Got a faulty grill for our table which had really bad fire temp and was taking a long time to cook food. Spoke to the waiters/waitresses, who just shrugged us off multiple times. The table behind us left, and we asked to switch to a new table, which was DENIED. The place was not filled, and since it was late night there were no more customers after. Are you kidding me? First time I've experienced terrible service like this in Toronto. Absolutely will not be coming back.  In terms of food, plates came relatively quickly and quality wasn't bad. Service was what really killed it."}
{"text":"I would consider this place pretty standard for Korean BBQ. Lunch menu has the basic choices you'd expect (side dishes, beef, chicken, fish, limited vegetables) and the service is rushed but not unfriendly. Fortunately, we didn't seem to go at a time when the place was packed, so the waiter came by several times to check on the grill, take more orders, refill water, etc. The meat also tasted fairly good, but nothing that stood out.  The worst part of it is probably the feeling of coming out of the place smelling like BBQ meat...and swearing to never eat it again for at least a year because you're so sick of it at that point :P"}
{"text":"Much like Korean Grill House, the banchan selection is also the same - beansprouts (with sesame oil, not spicy), daikon radish (pickled, not spicy), cabbage kimchi (exact same taste as KGH - I suspect it's premade, not homemade).   For lunch it is $1 more than KGH but it offers miso soup and salad with (what I think) is Japanese apple cider (not oil based) dressing. Plus, they have vegetables for grilling - zucchinis and bell peppers.   Must commend them for the great variety. I would come here for dinner next time compared to KGH they have a much greater selection (sushi, sashimi, miso and dessert - this place also serves Japanese food; tiger shrimp, salmon, ox tongue) on their all-you-can-eat dinner menu.   Grilled meats are all standard, what you'd expect - however the color of the chicken marinade looks quite like curry (maybe they used cumin to spice it?) but it it tastes like normal chicken. Another thing I liked about the chicken is that they have some tendons to it. Don't forget the BBQ dipping sauce.  The rice served here is long grain but has some stickiness to it - perfect to accompany grilled meats.   Problem is there wasn't enough staff to serve us but they are quick enough, especially with refills for sodas.  I prefer this over KGH. They are not as kitschy and they do not claim to be 'Korean' (because this kind of barbecue is not authentic Korean and should not be called Korean anyway).   Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The food is ok but the service is absolutely awful. Lol, it's laughably awful so be prepared to be ignored or forgotten when you order something. 2.5* due to service."}
{"text":"I wish they had these type's of \"All you can eat\" restaurants in NY!! My cousin took me here as a tourist in the city. I told him I wanted to eat well and he didn't steer me wrong. We came on a Saturday night and had the All You Can Eat Korean BBQ. We ordered a variety of items off the menu and started to grill away! Some of the things we ate included: calamari, shrimp, steak, chicken, zucchini, mushrooms, California/Salmon rolls,  fish, kimchi, seaweed salad, tofu, lamb...and the list goes on. For dessert, we got the green tea and mango ice cream. For about $30 a person, we couldn't go wrong.  Although the food was great, the service wasn't. The waitress was very forgetful in refilling our beverage orders and wasn't attentive when we wanted to order more."}
{"text":"i wish i could give this place a 0 star.  so my experience at this shitty ass place was soooo bad that i cannot even describe it. everything except the mango ice cream was terrible. don't  even get me started with the service, they absolutely treated me and my friends like shit.  i highly suggest that you do not go to this place. pls don't go u will waste ur money on crap"}
{"text":"This location can't compare to the one at midland and ncnicoll in scarborough.  It feels like your eating in a large hall with rows of seating and no sections.    Wait time was long on a Sat night and the staff took long to clean tables after people left."}
{"text":"What a rip off! The bill came without a detail breakdown of what we ordered. We then did our own calculation afterwards, we found out that they already included the tips in our bill! At the time we didn't think that much but felt something's wrong, and still we gave another 15% tips at the table. This is one of the reason I hate to go to these kinds of asian's ayce operations. Always ask you to tip them but they never provide a decent service or a smile. By the way, I don't remember if the food tasted good or not after I found out I was ripped off by Chako!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :@"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for Korean BBQ.  Lots of seating.  We came on a Sunday morning just after they closed and had no issues with being seated almost immediately.  Food wise it was ok.  I found the meat was not marinated as much and therefore, lacking in some flavour when comparing to other places I have been to.  Large selection included sea food items, chicken, pork, and beef.  Service wise it was ok.  The staff was prompt when needed but I found there were times where we felt we had been forgotten despite the restaurant not being busy at the time.    The place is a little hard to find but if you head all the way to the back of the main road which takes you there you'll find the restaurant facing Moxies.  Price was I believe it was comparable however I will mention I did not find the sides to a good variety.    Overall it was good but I've had better."}
{"text":"Ok Chako you've finally swayed me, impressed me, convinced me that you are the epitome of AYCE Korean BBQ in the GTA. There are many others BUT few who can compete at your level of superior play.   The secret dear friends is to visit Chako slightly after the lunch hour. The place will be empty and the quality in cuts and seasoning of the meat vastly improves over the poorly cut and lightly seasoned dinner selection (which you ironically will pay more for). However, I can't slag you entirely Chako you do seem to maintain a certain quality standard that has never upset my digestion and is still leagues ahead of your local competitors.   Unlike other Korean BBQ's in Toronto and the GTA, Chako is decorated in a contemporary fashion as opposed to the feeding trough style of others BUT for my money what makes this a great spot is that most tables are set up as a booth. Which means that despite the crowds on peak hours you can still maintain a somewhat intimate setting with your guests.  Getting to the meat of this review...literally (harr harr harr), the regular selection is usually suffice for most. If you are really feeling the seafood and want to pay the extra fee, well have at it hoss but I feel you'd be best served sticking to the basics (if I am paying for shrimp it better be headless and de-pooped - no korean bbq does this so don't be shocked when Chako is no different).   The beef short ribs are my favorite, I would pay just to eat these. I really enjoyed the beef as well and the chicken breasts (although when cooking it yourself, do make sure your take your time in cooking this, I've had many a raw center which was no body's fault but my greed self). The pork is OK but comes in last in my list of favs.  Aside from the meat selection you have your complimentary SIDES. Kimchi, Jasmin Rice, beat sprouts, deep fried tofu, etc etc. All amazing and all worth ordering seconds or thirds of (tofu maybe not so much).  Best and worst thing about a Korean BBQ, maybe even more so at Chako because of the booth set up, is the fact that you always leave smelling like you just spent the afternoon in the back yard sitting over the grill bathing in the smoke. Great for those winter months when you miss the smell of BBQ'd meat but not so great for a hot date or business lunch.  Last note: Green Tea ice cream. Order it, eat it, love it, thank me later ;)  Only down side is the staff can be very pushy about moving you along when they are busy (checking on your way too often) OR leaving you along far too long when you're looking to order more trays of meat - those sneaky little devils with their tricks (I'm onto you). All that said Chako is always a great spot and I will go back many many times. Whose coming with me?"}
{"text":"Listen its not all that bad here, but its just the service and the waiters there.  I love the night owl here way better than the other place down the street! They Chicken and Beef Ribs are marinated perfectly. Additional Veggies are included too Zucchini, Red and Green Peppers to Grill. Also a handful of a few appetizers are provided.  But Every time I tried to order more food, they are in rush and never listen to what i wanted exactly. They always have this sour face on like they hate being there. To Be honest i would give them more stars if only they smiled a little bit and have a pleasant staff that could greet you kindly."}
{"text":"Plenty of choice. Nice service  Nice service. We were a bit group. Around 70.  Zucchini, green peppers, as vegetable. Very salty miso soup unfortunately"}
{"text":"Chako KBBQ in Richmond Hill is huge compare to other KBBQ places so you don't usually have to wait to be seated.  The place is well decorated and looks clean.  The washrooms are nice and are individual.  The seating is a lot more comfortable than other places especially if you get the booth.  (other places with booth for KBBQ I know of it Kazan on Yonge street).  The meat quality at Chako is slightly better than the average.  If you go on weekends you can also order some sushi. Love the ice-cream as well and they do not have any limit on how many you want. Service is okay but can be slow and you need to ask to have the grill change.  The short ribs and the beef are my favourite for Chako.  They give you good appetizers as well.  They state on the menu that it is 2hr limit but they never enforce that.  Actually I do not remember any AYCE places that every kick you out if you stay more than 2 hrs.  This is my order for KBBQ in Richmond Hill/Markham (Best to worst) - Chingu - Chako - Kazan- Korean Grill House."}
{"text":"Chako is definitely one of my favourite restaurants to splurge on. The food is delicious. There is something about the marinade that I love.  Service is alright. There are times when the staff is attentive and check up on you, but there are other times when you have to remind them once or twice about an order.  The price is alright, can't really complain for all you can eat.  The only downside to this restaurant is that when you walk in there is smoke, and it's cloudy. There are no fans, so you end up smelling like barbecue and smoke, which makes it uncomfortable to go out elsewhere afterwards.  Overall, I keep coming back and am always satisfied!"}
{"text":"Service was on point. Prices are cheap compared to US Korean BBQ. I would not say it's the most delish. I feel that the marinate is not that tasty to me. We had a large group so they put us on one of the private rooms which was great."}
{"text":"So so so good! I have been to Chako several times with family and with friends. The food is great! Customer service could be improved. I recommend ordering a pitcher of water (or several depending on how many people you are with) and a lot of food the first round because it will be a while before you see that waiter again...ahha but I would still come again."}
{"text":"Wow. What a restaurant. I've been slaying Korean Barbecue's for many many years, and Chako's takes the cake, or kimchi rather.   From the moment you enter this restaurant you are greeted with a modern, warm and chic decor. The quality of meats, seafood, and vegetables for an all you can eat restaurant is exceptional and service  outstanding. I've been to this restaurant almost 10 times now and it has never disappointed.   They carry all the standard meats such as short ribs, beef, pork and chicken, as well as ox tongue. Seafood consists of tiger shrimps, calamari, mussels and fish fillets. Unlike most KBBQ'S I've been too, Chako's offers 4 types of sushi on the AYCE menu, as well as veggies such as: peppers, zucchini, and pineapple....PINEAPPLE!!   If you are looking for a solid AYCE KBBQ in and around the GTA, this is the spot. Lunch buffet equates to $10, a price that can not be beat. I highly recommend trying everything on the menu once, my favourite would be the pork w/ pineapple drizzled with kimchi juice, go ahead and wash that down with a Lychee Calpis.   *Please note Chako's is owned and operated by Japanese, not Koreans. This may be of importance to certain readers."}
{"text":"You would think that ayce Korean bbq and sushi would be a mind blowing genius business concept but... This place isn't good. Poor quality beef and poor quality sushi.  A restaurant that had an ayce concept with legit Kbbq and sushi would be so successful.  Too bad it doesn't exist in Toronto.  We won't be a world class city until I see this happen.  Good thing about this restaurant is that bubble tea is a short walk away.  Parking sucks in this plaza. This is a fact of life in this plaza. It always sucks."}
{"text":"I came here on Thursday October 23rd, 2014 with my girlfriends. I haven't been to Chako in about 4 years and had high hopes for the food to be good quality and good service. The service was decent, they were quick with bringing food and setting the table. However, the food was not great at all. The pork is very fatty and the only thing I would suggest are beef and chicken. The lighting and air ventilation in the restaurant is HORRIBLE, so DO expect walking out of there smelling like a walking barbecue. Due to the lack of lighting, I was never so sure if the food was cooked enough and little did I do, I walked out of there throwing up. Never paying $20+ to cook my own darn food and smelling like crap after."}
{"text":"Oh what happened to my used-to-be-lovely korean BBQ favourite?   Chako was definitely among one of my favourites. With its interactive concept of cooking your own food, it made the dinner both delicious and entertaining. But just a while after its openning, the food quality drastically diminished and the service along with it. Now if you go to Chako, you encounter rude waiters who either don't care about you or don't have the time to do so due to understaffing. And if you tolerate the rudeness and wait for a yummy award for your patience, you'll be disappointed by the meat quality.  I do not go to Chako anymore nor do I suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"So I was visiting my cousins a few months back and we decided to treat ourselves to some late night all you can eat. Upon arriving at like 9pm the place was pretty empty. Cool, that probably means fast and efficient service for us right? Boy were we in for a SURPRISE!   Upon being promptly seated we started to order our first round and I noticed something strange about the waiter. He seemed very..idk..uninterested? But I was like whatever idc, i just wanna eat. I havent really been a guy that was big on exceptional service anyway. We finish our first round within like 25 minutes and we start expecting the guy to come back since its been a while. Up to this point, he hasnt checked on us once. We decide to not try to wave anyone down to order the next round since he was bound check on us soon right? I mean it has been 25 minutes. We wait another 10 ish minutes. Our guy is literally NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. We caught a few glimpses of him here and there doin his own thing but he was quickly gone soon after. I mean like i get it if the place is packed and busy but theres literally only like 6 parties in the ENTIRE restaurant. What else would he be doing that would demand so much of his time?!?! In the end we had to flag down another waiter to put in our order. And even doing that was hard. It seemed like no one was walking past our table at all. Also keep in mind this place is open til 12am and we were here at 9pm so it wasnt like we were one of those customers that come in right before closing. He still had 3 hours on his shift. After finishing the second round we finally catch him walking past our table and flag him down to put in an order for a third round. To my surprise, he actually seemed ANNOYED while we were talking to him. Bruhhhhh we already had to flag down another waiter for the previous round and now you act like were wasting your time? First of all isn't this kinda like, idk, YOUR JOB?! After our third round it was time for dessert and once again, we had to actively flag him down and he comes off as annoyed. My cousin then asks him how large the ice cream portions are, and he literally puts out his hand with an emotionless/stoned face and says nothin. Uhhh whats thats supposed to mean? As big as your hand? He wasnt making any shapes with his fingers either so i honestly dont know what his thought process was. At this point we weren't even mad anymore cuz it was hilariously bad. We end up leaving the restaurant without tipping him a penny, which pretty much never happens. I have literally never experienced service this bad in my life.   In terms of the food, it was decent. It was cool that they did sushi rolls in addition to bbq, but whats the point if we couldn't eat much since WE COULDNT GET A WAITER TO PUT IN OUR ORDER. At the end of the night we spent probably a total of 2.5 hrs here and we could only put in 3 rounds before giving up and taking dessert. I usually would give a place at least one more star if the food was decent but I think I need to make a point here, so nopeee. I also tried catching the guys name but I couldn't in time. Sigh...he should not be working there...SO BADD -.-"}
{"text":"Terrible dining experience... The description of the meal from the waiter was so blur that we could hardly eat out what had been recommended from him. The meat were all in large size while the fork and knife were not provided unless we asked."}
{"text":"I find it to be one of the better all u can eat korean bbq places, and you cant beat the late night deal! Abut 15$ a person and it comes with most the meats and soup, salad, rice, side dish. I find the short ribs are great here!"}
{"text":"So, a friend and I went in for what we thought would be a nice relaxing sitdown meal.   First. We were greeted at the door by the server so asked us to take a seat and wait, assuming we wanted to sit in a booth/banquette, which we did not, as we wanted a table due to the table height. She never asked, just told us to have a seat and then came back to tell us there were no booths, which would not have been an issue if she had asked before.  So they have us seated at the table and the first thing we notice is that there is no heat dispersion ring on our grill. We tell her this and she said that we don't need it. But then again, take a closer look at your table and you'll notice that if you do have one, they are propped up and held afloat by plastic solo condiment cups! Three to be exact!  We put in our order and we sit and wait for the trays to arrive, 10 minutes or so. And brought to us by a different waiter. He turns on the grill, but for whatever reason, it takes him several minutes to complete. We give it about 5 minutes to get it nice and hot so to be able to sear our food, hence the word \"grill\" and \"bbq\".  Food hits the grill and... This is where it all goes downhill. I've asked waiter number 2 if he could bring me a knife and fork since I am not skilled that great with the chopsticks. After about 7 minutes, no one comes back, so I approach the service station and kindly ask for one, and the woman, who seems to be a bit perturbed that I approached the service station utters in another language, I assume to set a napkin roll for me. I later find out she is the manager for the evening.  *sidenote: I am a regular across the street at Korean Grill House, so my experiences are compared to what I am use to there.  So, food hits the grill and we start with pork. Took about 10 mins to grill. Now, for a thin cut off any meat, a couple of minutes a side is more than enough time. We hit the grill next with some side ribs. 3 pieces. Two finish \"grilling\" in about 15 minutes and the third piece finished about 30 minutes later than those other two. When the other two pieces came off, we let the grill \"try\" to regain some heat because we want to try the thin beef. And the chicken. Now with chicken, I ain't gonna mess around with cooking temp., so please be careful. Let that sit on the grill while we move on...  So we throw some sliced beef on the grill, and while that finished a bit faster, it's still taking a while to finish. We bring this up to server number 3, a nice kid who tells us that in other words, the grills are inconsistent. So we ask if we can move to another table and he tells us he will consult with the manager...  Ok, so we have the grill going with 1 rib, a piece of beef and the chicken... I broke out my iPhone and timed how long the chicken would take to cook so that there was no sign of pink. I've uploaded the photo, and we gave up after 15 or 16 minutes.    The waiter comes back to check the inside of our grill and he was the only positive in this, since he was trying to make our experience better. We weren't being rude or pushy, just wanted to know if there was something strange going on with the grill and if there was, to try another table. He got that.  Finally Ms. Manager doesn't stop at our table, but walks by and my bud had to flag her down to get her to stop. At this point, we get the idea that she was avoiding us. She didn't listen to us, or even make eye contact. My friend and I share that the food is taking a long time to cook and we see the table sign says 2-hour seating limit. To which she answers \"Oh no. You stay\" to say \"don't worry, take your time\"...  and then marched off to get water. Now during this, I've also ordered a Coke. Takes another 10 mins to arrive and it's Ms. Manager who not only brings it, but gives it to my friend who didn't order a Coke. A few minutes later, another Coke arrived and we have to explain that we only ordered one and that it already arrived.   Our original waitress arrives and we tell her that this is all taking way way too long and that we would like our bill and we are not going to post the $3/tray leftover fee that is also listed in the table sign.  Now, the final nail on the coffin. The receipt had a 10% service fee. It all makes sense now... Why go out of our way to help these fools out when they are now forced to pay out gratuity?!   In the end horrible customer service, ate more in tofu than anything else and I might be turned off from eating grilled beef from now on.  We leave, and hit the McDonald's at Yonge and Valleymede. I get a large coffee and my friend gets a poutine, because he's still hungry and my appetite was ruined.  I'm not biased all and my prior reviews for other places shows this. But, this makes sense why there is a lineup out the door at Korean Grill House on Friday nights.   And my clothes and hair were drenched in the odour of rendered grease."}
{"text":"Went here for weekend dinner, which included the extra weekend dinner menu stuff.  Beef was okay. Lamb was good. Chako beef was ok. Ribs were good. Chicken was okay. Pineapple was okay. Mushroom were kinda tasteless.  Sushi items are mostly forgettable, and I would recommend everyone NOT to try it. Handrolls and rolls were mostly rice and very little fish. Seaweed was also soggy. Avoid.  Considering it's more expensive than most other places, I'm surprised they don't include any drinks with the price (only free water). Green tea cost a dollar and had no free refill."}
{"text":"Standard KBBQ selection and variety of vegetables, seafood, and sushi. Casual KBBQ experience with an easy to navigate menu selection. While there is a selection of different meats to choose from, they tend to have the exact same seasoning and flavouring; to the point that the different meats are indistinguishable in taste. Depending on the time you go (weekend, lunch vs dinner service) the service differs in speed, however, waiters are typically quick to top off water and to clean the grill upon request."}
{"text":"I should know better than to go to a place like this.  The cheap price brings out the loudest diners.  Worse than that is the horrible service.  No greeting whatsoever.  I asked to be seated in a quiet area, she brings us to a booth beside a group of 20, thanks lady.  It took too long for anyone to come to our table  so we decided to leave.  I don't know why people frequent places like this that have such awful service.  Will not be returning, ever."}
{"text":"Chako Barbecue is the staple Korean Barbecue spot in Markham. For those of you who are unaware, KBBQ is essentially a BBQ experience where you are served a variety of pre-marinated and seasoned meats, which you then have the responsibility of cooking yourself on the grill situated in the center of your table. You may be thinking \"why am I paying to cook my own food?\", but it's honestly a pretty fun experience, and meat is delicious, so get over it.  Chako is located in a pretty vibrant restaurant area. It's a sizeable restaurant, and the interior has a welcoming, warm ambience. As for seating, you're looking at either booths or regular tables. Great look.  To speak to the food, again you get a variety of meats, from chicken and pork, to beef tongue and squid, all of which are seasoned well and generally don't leave you wanting for any more seasoning. Though you generally come here for meat, there are a variety of other options like sushi, rolls, rice, and miso soup. To offset all the protein there are veggie options as well, my personal favourites being grilled edamame, kimchi, and bean sprouts.  So why the 3 star? On the last occasion when I went I got a little fed up with some of the customer service. Aside from the usual need to rassle down your waiter to order food, our waiter actually spilled my friend's glass of water on him... preceded to look at the spill with fleeting concern... finished pouring someone else's glass of water... then left. I mean common! My friend chose not to pursue it, so it ended there, but damn would I have been pissed. I've got to come correct though; that relatively cheap, and great tasting all you can eat BBQ won't let me drop it lower than a 3. I recognize that one waiter doesn't speak to the whole. (Otherwise I'd go 4.)"}
{"text":"We went for late night and was disappointed at the limited selection You only get 4 types of meat and 2 types of seafood (squid, fish) for the late night menu with no option to pay extra for the regular menu. It was our first visit and we wanted to order ONE plate for each type of meat to start so that we can experiment with what we like before ordering the next round. Instead our service took it upon himself to bring us two plates of certain meats (likely the ones that they are trying to rid of by the end of the night), which happened to be the ones that we liked the least because these weren't seasoned or marinated. We are flabbergasted that a Korean BBQ place has no ventilation. The only positive thing was that service was fast...then again, it doesn't exactly take a long time to put bland meat on a plate."}
{"text":"Korean BBQs in Toronto mostly fall into two categories, the cheap and plentiful style that offer cheap all-you-can-eat meat on a grill (as seen in the downtown \"Korean Grill House\" variety), and the non-all-you-can-eat variety that tend to have much better meat, much nicer ambience, and significantly higher prices (e.g. $25 per plate of meat), like Seoul House in North York.  Chako is a reasonable compromise between those two. They are spacious and well-decorated, their meat is typically a little nicer than the cheaper restaurants, but they're still all-you-can-eat and lower priced than some of the more expensive Korean grills.  Their meat is decent, but still not up to the high quality of the more expensive range. The quality of the cuts and marinade seems to vary from visit to visit. Sometimes the marinade is flavourful and permeates the meat, other times it's hard to detect. The sliced beef is sometimes thicker and sometimes thinner, sometimes very cohesive, sometimes prone to shredding as you cook it. It's always decent, just sometimes it's better than others times.  Service is usually reasonably prompt, but not especially detail-orientd. Be prepared to ask for something more than once or send something back that you didn't ask for (or eat things you didn't ask for). It's not a big deal, but their error rate is higher than other restaurants.  The lunch crowd keeps the restaurant busy, but not to capacity. I gather it gets really full in the evening.  Still, I come here fairly regularly, and I enjoy myself, so they're basically getting some of the important things right."}
{"text":"Location: 163 York Boulevard Richmond Hill (next to Destiny) Price: $$$ Service: Alright  This place usually isn't busy when I go, even when I go on the weekends as well. I\"ve been to Chako a couple of times. I usually go to Chako for late dinner (pass 10pm) so usually there's not a lot of selections but it was good enough to be full. This time around I went with my family for dinner. I was quite surprise about their selection for dinner. Most Korean BBQ don't usually offer seafood as a part of all you can eat unless you would like to upgrade (+ $3-5 on top of the regular price). Dinner was around $25/ person (include tax and tip). Their service was alright it wasn't special but they were there when you need check up.  One thing that's really special about Chako is that they also offer sushi as a part of all you can eat. The sushi may not be a fresh as the one you would usually get at a specialize sushi place, but it's passable. I also really enjoyed their miso soup! Another thing I enjoyed was their ox tongue and kimchi. I was in love with the kimchi that they had- it was a perfect of sweet, a little bit sour, spicy and crunch!   The reason why it only received 3/5 stars is because I have to go back and try their sushi special on the weekend. TBA  Overall: Decent"}
{"text":"Korean BBQ with sushi! The Korean BBQ is really good.  Deliciously marinated meat (chicken, beef, pork, lamb) and quite a few other foods like squid, (shelled) shrimp, and more.  I love variety, so this is great!  I'm a sucker for sushi and while their sushi is sub-par I love that they offer it.  It adds a bit of freshness to my meat-heavy meal.  The servers are all pretty attentive, so no complaints there.  Not amazing, but not bad by any means.  Few drawbacks that are worth mentioning: - It's a bit pricey for Korean bbq.  I think it's $24 for weekend dinners.  But I counter that with the great variety that they offer. - You will most definitely come out smelling like delicious food.  I could see this as not being horribly desirable. - They're really adamant about not seating you until your whole party is there.  I think they said that they do this because there is a time limit and don't want to start your time until everyone is there.  I've never been kicked out for being there too long though.  Overall, I love this place.  I'd go a bit more often if it was a bit cheaper but I appreciate all that they have to offer."}
{"text":"So so so full from Chakos BBQ meat, sushi, pineapple, zucchini, and bell peppers. I am so full that my fingers probably gained weight and I am trying so hard to make no typos right now.  For $21.99 for ALL YOU CAN EAT (insert Homers line \"the sign said all you can eat! all you can eat!) it is a super super good deal. Get your moneys worth and eat all of the delicious beef, pork, and lamb until you break your belt notch.  Its probably best you come here in your cheap sweats just incase you get too ambtious with the food like we did.  The service is impeccable and we were there on a busy Friday night. Make sure you make reservations because this place gets busy quickly.  Our servers were quick to pick up our dirty plates and replace them quickly with beef, beef ribs, pork, lamb, veggies, and sushi.  The sushi was decent but really it is just  a bonus to the Korean BBQ.  Try to make sure you take it easy on the carbs so you have plenty of room for all that protein that they are well known for.  Parking is plentiful at this location. Bathrooms are really clean.  All in all this is a great place to come if you are looking for an EPIC cheat meal!!!! Oh wait..they give you a 2 hour limit BUT Im sure that will be plenty of time to eat a farmful (thats probably not a word but it is now!) of animals and veggies!!"}
{"text":"Luv luv luv. Addicting and good service ! Still craving it a year later, will def go back when I'm in Toronto again."}
{"text":"How is this place still open? The absolute worst Korean BBQ place I've ever been to. The quality of the meats is terrible. Servers don't really care. Ventilation is bad, especially for a place where you cook your own food. Hopefully you're not one of the unfortunate souls that sit in the back of the restaurant, close to the restroom. It is so smokey back there you almost expect Dave Chappelle to appear dress as Rick James! Stay away"}
{"text":"I live near Yonge/Finch where there are lots of KBBQ (non AYCE). I've also been to Korea eating with natives. So I know what \"real\" KBBQ should be like. Both Chako and Korean Grill House (KGH) are more \"Chinese\" than Korean in a sense. So if you're looking for an authentic KBBQ experience, this is not the place. Chako also claims this place is an Izakaya. If this place is an Izakaya, then my dining room is also an Izakaya. Don't get me wrong. This is still a great place to stuff yourself and hang out with people.  Chako is like an upgraded version of KGH. They serve essentially the same dishes, use the same grills, and even season the food similarly. The difference is Chako has some sushi options, and their meat quality is slightly better. The sushi is nothing to go crazy about. On weekdays they hardly have any real \"fish based\" sushi. I would stick with the BBQ items. I like how they have ice cream.  The prices are very reasonable. For just a little bit more than KGH, Chako offers a better experience. Chako has short ribs even for late night.  I'll never forget Chingu. That place was the perfect balance between being authentic and having an AYCE option. Chako doesn't measure up to Chingu, but since Chingu is gone now, Chako is the next best option for pigging out at AYCE KBBQ. Of course, if I want a real KBBQ, I should stick with the Korean places near my area.   Make sure you wear washable clothes if you come here. You're going to smell like BBQ afterwards. Every time I have KBBQ, the first thing I do after getting home is to take a shower."}
{"text":"Make sure you wear an outfit that you can wash right afterward.  You're going to smell greasy from head to toe.  This is the only korean bbq I go to in Toronto, because they serve pineapple for BBQ!  It's so delicious ...yum..."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this Korean Bbq itself. I am a Kbbq enthusiast and this place really doesn't cut it for me. Their short ribs are so tasteless and this is probably the only thing that you look forward to when you go to this place. But it was very disappointing. The other meat options are very basic and didn't seem that great. Their lamb had a really weird texture and their chicken tasted so bland. Usually kbbqs have amazing marinate but this place does it so poorly that you really need to add some soy sauce to your meat in order for it to taste like something.   Service is another thing that they really need to focus on. We asked for short ribs four times and we never got them. They take forever to change the grills and they forget orders. We didn't want some of the meat but they insisted to give us everything!  Also keep in mind that Ayce does not include the pop. Usually when you go to Ayce kbbq, they include free pop. But this place will charge you an extra $2. 79!"}
{"text":"Came to this place by accident as the other place we were going to had a 45 minute wait . I am so happy we came here the food was fresh and all you can eat ! We cooked it at our table was fun and we really enjoyed the meal I highly recommend this place and on the weekend they have an expanded menu with many great selections . This will become a stop for me from now on , every time I am  in the GTA !  This place has inspired me to seek out a similar type place back home in NYC :)"}
{"text":"As someone who enjoys kbbq every now and then, I personally would not recommend coming to Chakos.   To sum up a really bad review, the lines and wait times are abnormally long (I really don't understand why people rave over Chakos when there are much better kbbq places elsewhere), the food is really average, service could be better, and they have a terrible ventilation system - the whole place reeks of this greasy charcoal smell that makes me lose my appetite.   So no, I won't be coming back here unless every other restaurant in the world closes down. Even then I'd probably think twice about paying another visit here."}
{"text":"This isn't really part of my usual spots to hit so here goes. It was Korean bbq so it was an ayce and grill your own food.  I like to first start with the good  Decent variety Attentive staff, checking on the grills.  I would think if staff didn't pay attention there would be issues.  Bad Taste - wasn't anything special Price- 31ish after tax and service charge (10% percent group of 6) Ventation- no proper vent system, smell like charcoal and meat. Style- seem more Chinese then Korean (not an expert thou)  Despite this isn't something I frequent, it wasn't anything to brag about. Ayce is nice but the food wasn't anything special or stand out. Which why it get about 2.5 but I round it up."}
{"text":"I've been here before for lunch. Wasn't satisfied.   Came here for late night. Which is 19.99. And still didn't leave full.   The services is so bad that they put 10% tip into every bill just to mAke sure you tip.  The water glasses sooooo small and they barely refil.   The rice was so gummy t wasn't rice?? It looked like a ball of mashed potato. But apparently that's how they do it. Over cooked.   Wasn't worth it. If you're looking for delicious meat and wonderful service go to touro right beside in plaza. It's incredible there. Little more pricey but atleast you leave full for days"}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place. A late night BBQ might not sound like a good idea but we went anyways.  This is a really great place to have a BBQ. The flames were strong the whole time.Beef slices were thin so they cooked the quickest. Chicken was properly marinated and tasted great. Fish was the freshest and was not marinated.  Sides are included, so feel free to order them while waiting for the meat on the grill. I recommend Kimchi and miso soup.  Clean restaurant, fancy decor, and wonderful service."}
{"text":"My regular ayce  Korean BBQ place to go.  The food is very tasty, especially the short ribs.  I can never get enough!  Lol. Just be aware, you gonna smell like BBQ after dinner.  Guess they have not clean the exhaust system for a long time."}
{"text":"For dinner, it is kind of pricey, but it is so worth. All of the meats are deliciousss!!! And if you go with your friends, it's such a good time :) If you don't mind staying up later, you can go after 10 PM, and you can go by the late-night price, which is much cheaper & you can get just as full & happy :) Sometimes, they have left-over meat from dinner & they'll give it to you when you ask for all the meats xD It's great.  Also, strategically ask for your grill change during the middle of your meal, because you only get one. I enjoy the ambiance there. Pretty loud, because everyone is having such a great time!!! :D"}
{"text":"Come here after 10pm on weekdays (Mon-Thurs) and you can have your all-you-can-eat meal for $16.99 now that's a steal deal!   I came here on a Thursday before 8:30pm so I paid $22.99 which still isn't bad for an all-you-can-eat BBQ place. So I give this place two thumbs up for being competitive on their pricing.   The selection of meats are pretty good. The veggie selection not so great. And the cold dishes was just OK ... I like ordering the pickled radish as it goes well with all the meat dishes. Not so fond of the sushi rolls but this place isn't a sushi place so you can't really expect their rolls to be that good.   Overall I still give this place a nice 4 star for catering to late night eating, being competitive on their pricing and having a great selection of drinks on their menu."}
{"text":"The only reason why me and my friends continue to come back any Chakos is because of convenience. Going to K town on yonge is too far and parking is a nightmare there. So we wind up settling on Chakos which everyone knows is not authentic Korean BBQ.   Over the years the menu has pretty much stayed the same but I have found the quality has gone down while prices have risen! Lunch on a holiday/saturday/sunday is not 17.99! Lunch and late night used to be about 11.99 at most. But after seeing the last price increase I might need to reduce the amount of KBBQ in my diet.   This location is not as well ventilated as the McNicoll one for sure. The waiters here are so never to be seen unless you wave your hand in the air for like 5 minutes. I found this last visit that the smoke and greasy started to smog up in the air and surfaces got sticky even... I had my phone facing up on the table and near the end of the meal there was thin layer of what looked like dust/grease GROSS. It was easy to clean but still. My clothes were soaked in the smell as usual but that is why I never wear nice nothing to KBBQ that would be foolish.   In the end would I return? If my friends really really wanted to go but I would not have suggest it myself."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  Lucky for the waiter they pre-charge you for the tip in the bill, the service wasn't worth a full %15 tip. For $25 you can get a much better meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I went last night for late night eats, we were given quick service for our table which was great. Unfortunately throughout the meal the more my group of 10 guests ordered, the lower quality service we received.   Service is not good at this location for every reason you can think of. Bad attitude is a big one.  The ventilation was horrible, one of my friends needed his puffer during his meal from the intense smoke inside the restaurant. The smoke gets into your hair, pores, and eyes. Your clothes will smell like meat after which is common.   If you can commute to the Scarborough location, definitely do it, it's worth the 20 minute drive."}
{"text":"Unlike most people in GTA, who got through university late nights with $10 after 10pm specials on AYCE KBBQ, I haven't touched the stuff in close to 10 years. I had completely forgotten how it tasted, only the fact that the smell clings to your clothes like a needy girlfriend. So despite my beef with the mandatory tip, I'm still going to give 4 stars (actually 3.5 but whatever) because that sizzle and seasoning has gotten me back on the KBBQ wagon.   At the weekend lunch price of $15.99, you get a decent selection of meats/seafood (beef slices, chicken, short ribs, fish, squid) which is good enough for lunch though I do wish there were more veggie options (red/green pepper, zucchini). The fish fillets were quite large so they didn't fall apart when picked up from the grill. The short ribs were tasty, but random pieces were really chewy for some reason.   Service was great. Super attentive and very helpful. Sure, there were only 2-3 tables of people but at least the servers weren't idling around like some restaurants during down time. Chako is also pretty clean for a place that expels hot oil for money...except the blinds. Never touch the blinds.    I do have to say though, slipping in mandatory gratuity without telling anyone is sneaky. Sneakier still when you know that people probably won't look too closely because all they want to do is leave ASAP to shower away the grease and shame of eating their body weight in grilled meat. I don't think the service charge was even on the receipt, the post-tip total was just punched into the machine and handed to me. Not cool, Chako, not cool.  (59/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"Chako's hasn't really changed over the years, and thats a good thing. it is korean bbq place that is focused on one thing, getting you full and satisfied with lots of meat.   Chako is a place that on weekend will have more offer of veggies and meats then most other Korean bbq place. and it is a ayce. Although they have sushi, they're sushi for the most parts is a best to avoid type of business. and just focus on the meat.   The quality of meat is generally pretty good, and the atmosphere and nice. Overall there isn't much to say about chakos other then the selection is excellent adn the price is pretty average and on point. Chakos has been around for quite a bit, but of course for those who wan authentic korean bbq, this is the wrong place to go, as this is more geared towards the chinese style of korean bbq, and they're cuts of meat and marinating reflects it. Overall it is a great place to go with a group to enjoy lots of bbq food, without the hassle of doing it at home."}
{"text":"The food is good sometimes by the service is TERRIBLE. Rudest managers, customer service is zero. Used to like that place but very disappointed! Make sure you bring it to their attention if they are rude."}
{"text":"3.5*  Cool looking place with private-feeling booths which I loved.  Service started strong and I thought it would be better than what I'm used to with Korean Grill House. And then it wasn't. Food was just as good though there seemed to be less selection at a similar price. And so there were certain items like the sausage that I missed.   Their green tea ice cream might be the best green tea ice cream I've had so I'll give them that!  I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Chako but it's certainly a good option."}
{"text":"went during late night....good value for the amount of meat you get. I really loved their pickled radishes. Not very well ventilated though I must add (it was quite smoky when we first stepped in) +1 for food not tasting burnt in the end like other ayce bbq places."}
{"text":"I went on a weekday after work, all you can eat korean bbq for $17.99pp. There was not a lot of selection, we ordered everything for the first round, and randomly some was doubled up... and it was the ones we didnt like at all... so we told them to take some back.  anyways we didn't like any of the meat, the cut was way too thick, except the ox tongue which was nice and thin, and you cant really go wrong with chicken. Like I said NOT MUCH CHOICES! no lettuce wraps, no dipping sauces...  our grill was changed twice, after we asked, cause our food was getting burnt. Atleast they changed it.  bottom line, will never return."}
{"text":"I always have a great time at Chako's! The food is always great and arrives very fast. Service is also speedy and efficient. Love going there with a big group of people. Will always recommend and go back to Chako's."}
{"text":"Costomer service 10/10 Food 8/10 The only down side was there was so much smoke I think their Hood fan was not working and all the smoke from bbq was staying in there! But in general recommend it."}
{"text":"Chakos has been great and it has been bad, really hit or miss with this place. However I do love the short ribs! The service at this place is usually slow as they are generally quite busy. The servers are not pleasant however when you go to places like this it is not for the service but for the food. The food is good when you want some cheap KBBQ.   This is not the place to go for an authentic Korean bbq experience, but it does provide an adequate kbbq experience if you go in with the right expectations! Defiantly go for the short ribs and sliced beef as those are definitely the tastiest options available. I also like the variety of different options you have as far as choice for what you want to grill, with meat, sea food and vegetables"}
{"text":"Meat choice is ok.. just the usual beef, chicken pork.....  What I found was the choice for veggie are very limited... wished they have a little bit more choice especially we all eat a lot of meat, and needed some more neggie to balance back.   The service are ok...... but sometime u really needed to wait awhile before you see a waiter / waitress walk by...  If you are just looking for a place for average  korean BBQ, here is the place"}
{"text":"It's OK for All You Can Eat as Lunch! Quite delicious meat (pork and beef and short rib), it is just right. It's not salty nor sweet (if u know Korean BBQ well)   Not much choices for BBQ All You Can Eat for Lunch thorough."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Come here a few times, and I always regret it after.   I eat too much.  It's just too good.  I can't stop.  I have a problem.  I love it.   Anyways, they are really clean. They change the grill frequently unlike some places.  Love the booths.  But most of all,  LOVE THE LATE NIGHT DINNER PRICE :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday evening.  They have a sushi menu as well but really... You are coming here for Korean BBQ.  The non sushi items were a miss.    They have a cold noodles that is overly salty.  The tuna in the spicy tuna roll was dry.  So overall, you are better off not ordering the sushi rolls because they are wasting your stomach space.  The beef ribs, beef, and chicken are good.  You can tell that is where they spend the money on.  The beef ribs was delicious.    Another plus is if you come here after 10pm it is $18.99.  it looks like that is the time when this place starts getting filled up.  Not the best but I will come back for the cheaper price after 10pm"}
{"text":"Fairly decent restaurant and certainly not my favorite. I've had Korean BBQ both in the U.S. and in Asia and they still a lot of work to do."}
{"text":"I've only been here for the late night dinner so that's what I'm reviewing on.  I've had two different experiences, the first time, it was great, 5 stars. The second time, it was ok, 3 stars.  There's not a whole lot to say about the place. It's large, it can be loud, and the service is meh. I suggest ordering a lot of food at the beginning (like four dishes per person) and then ask for anything else you want when you get a chance to later on in your meal. Sometimes the meat is very well marinated, sometimes it's not. I know that's not very helpful, but that's how it is. Also, the thicker things, like the chicken, fish and pork take a longer time to cook, than say, the veggies and the beef, so put those on first. All that being said, their menu consists of beef, chicken, salmon, pork, sushi, some other meats, zucchini, red peppers, salad, rice, mango ice-cream, green tea ice-cream, and a few other things I can't recall.  They have an decent drink list but it seems much too overpriced for this place. I can't quite remember but it seemed like most of the drinks should have had 2 dollars knocked off for it to be in line with everything else.   If your grill gets too dirty and things are taking too long to clean, you can ask for them to switch it and they will. It takes like 30 seconds.   ***At lunch (not sure about dinner) any dish you don't finish costs you $3. Don't get too greedy and ask for a whole bunch only to have to pay it back in dividends. They also include a 10% tip in the bill, so be sure to remember that.***  It's a decent place, worth visiting. I'd go for the late night dinner and pay a cheaper price and get hungrier in the meantime. I've been here twice, and I'll probably go again, even though it's far from when I live."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The servers and mangement are extremely rude and unprofessional. They're always trying to get you out the door. I understand it's an all-you-can-eat and they're trying to get as many patrons as possible but giving customers attitude and asking them if they're done is not the way to handle it.   I have a feeling the food is handled poorly. I got food poisoning lol. It was bad enough for me to go South Lake Hospital that night. Do yourself a favour and try somewhere else."}
{"text":"We used to come here when we got a Korean BBQ craving. It isn't authentic but it did the trick.   Our last experience was our last unfortunately. We were a party of 9 and had to switch tables a couple times because the burners were not working. The sushi was more like a rice ball rather than sushi. One of our female servers was just plain rude. She knocked something over on one of my guests and didn't even apologize.  Unfortunately we will be going somewhere else for our Korean BBQ now."}
{"text":"A good solid choice. Give me Kimchi, and I am happy although those around me may suffer some after effects.  They have a broad selection of items, and they are generous with their portions. I very much like the squid, and their pork is very well spiced. The sides are very generic, but the Kimchi does have that nice oyster taste, although I don't think its made on the premises.  My only suggestion would be to encourage them to change the grill plates more often. I you get around to grilling pineapple, which is yummy, it will always have some meat/fish flavour. They should have colour coded grills for that purpose.  I only eat there with male friends, as my better half is not a Korean BBQ enthusiast. The locale is very new, and beautiful, in a minimalist kind of way, but it works. If you are looking for a good all-you-can-eat, this is a good place!"}
{"text":"Not bad food but sushi rolls were a bit bland and the rice a bit too soggy.  As like in my reviews of other establishments, if going to this particular location on a Friday eve or on any of the weekend eves, do go early and make a reservation if possible.  Line-ups and lack of parking (despite the large parking lot) occurs later on in the evening, since the Highway 7 and East Beaver Creek region gets B-U-S-Y as the evening progresses.  The service isn't too shabby but I wish the ventilation was better.  It gets smokier in the place as it gets busier.  Still...Would love to go back in the near future.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone loving Korean BBQ - But keep in mind...Not run by Koreans.  It's run by Chinese. - Now...To do the laundry and wash the Korean BBQ scent from all of our clothing!"}
{"text":"Chako offers an AYCE KBBQ with a modern feel. It's clean and spacious, allowing some room for ventilation, though you will go back home, smelling like your dinner. Weekend dinner comes to about $18.99.   - Meats: There are some average to decent cuts of meat. The most memorable was the Chako Ribs (which is only available for dinner). thicker and marinated. Delicious!  - Vegetables: There's pineapples! And also zuchhini and red peppers. But pineapples! Who wouldn't be excited?  - Sushi: There are 4 choices of sushi. Average, but at least you do have the option to order it at a KBBQ.  - Seafood:  Calamari, tiliapia, shrimp and mussels.  - Side dishes: As mentioned, the kim chi is surprisingly tasty. You're also offered tofu, bean sprouts, seaweed.  Of course, order the rice. I don't know how anyone can go through all that sodium/fat without blending that taste.  Chako is a good choice for group outings, though it can get quite packed during Friday and Saturday nights. Service start to be much slower and inconsistent: multiple attempts to re-order dishes that never showed up, or to change the BBQ plate, or to clear some of the dishes away. So it can get quite frustrating."}
{"text":"Meant to post this review a month ago. First time going to Chako and it s definitely a place to visit if you love Korean bbq and Sushi.  However at first the thought of all-you-cant-eat sushi and korean bbq seems overwhelming.  The selection is more than enough, and the price is standard as most sushi/ korean bbq places.  The staff are helping....the only thing I wasn't a fan of were the restrooms....Someone needs to clean that.........stuff up, its not a pleasant  scene to witness after eating a full load of meats, or seafood lol...Nonetheless a place cure those Korean BBQ and sushi fans...."}
{"text":"Our party of three came in for lunch on Boxing day and it was very empty - there were maybe 2 other tables there. The lunch menu included - bell peppers, zucchini, beef, pork, chicken, fish filet (not salmon), squid, and beef short ribs, for $16.99 per person (adult, holiday price). The chicken was marinated with a curry-type sauce/powder and the beef slices were marinated with lots of red pepper, which made them quite spicy. The all-you-can-eat menu includes rice, Korean side cold dishes, miso soup, salad, and green tea/mango ice-cream.  During our meal, the waitstaff never came to replace the grill, which is something they usually do at other KBBQ establishments, so by the middle of our meal, our grill was completely black and caked. They do charge an automatic 10% gratuity on top of your bill post-tax, similar to other Japanese AYCE places. The seating is pretty cramped and as is typical to most KBBQ places, it gets fairly stuffy with more tables around. They are a little pricier than other KBBQ places, but they do offer beef short ribs and dessert. Final note, whatever you wear and bring into the restaurant will come out smelling like KBBQ for a while, so be careful about thick and furry coats!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!! Extremely unsanitary and poor service. There was a DEAD SPIDER ON OUR FOOD. Their compensation was to make 1 meal free...we had 8 people with us.   They are also notorious for the worst service ever. Manager was very rude. He picked up the phone while we were in the middle of asking for a table. Then he storms off doing something else. When we demanded that we wanted a seat, he just kept on explaining that he's too busy....whatever that means.  Also, if you want any service, you have to get out of your seat and find yourself a server. Oh, and there's a 10% service charge."}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Not terrible but certainly not good.   Service is terrible.   If you find a server who understands English you'll get what you order.     Nobody checks on you,  you have to be on the lookout for servers who try to walk as fast as possible hoping to not get flagged down to help a table.   Worst of all there is a 10% gratuity added onto the bill with no notice on the menu or anywhere else as far as I could see.  Then the credit card terminal comes and asks if you want to to add a tip.  I chose the tip option and tipped a further 15% before noticing that they already added a tip without my knowledge.   I brought this up to the server who said \"I didn't force you to tip\".  Asked for the manager and my 15% was given back to me in cash by the server.   Manager didn't even bother to show up at my table.   I believe an automatic gratuity needs to be shown on a menu."}
{"text":"Chako (which is owned by the Destiny Group, which also owns Wasabi buffet and Destiny BBT) is a Chinese style all you can eat grill serving savoury marinated meats that includes the basic stapes like pork, chicken, beef, short ribs, salmon, tilapia, shrimp, mussels, squid, etc.  Ask any Korean national and they'll tell you that this is far from the authentic Korean BBQ experience.  Because of the cramp grilling stations with highly inadequate venting, you WILL smell heavily like grilled meats once you leave. The heavy MSG used in the marinade will stay with you for hours if not a couple of days after the fact.  A buffet is rarely about freshness of ingredients, or even superb taste.  Once you are able to understand that a buffet is to satisfy one's heavy cravings for grilled meats, then you can start to enjoy it for what it is and not expect a high quality dining experience.  Chako fits the bill whenever I want to stuff myself silly with BBQ'd beef, despite how I may feel queasy for going over my stomach's limit the day after.  Service is a hit and miss, sometimes good sometimes bad.  It's super busy on weekends, so do expect to wait a bit for a table if you are with a big group.  There was once a true Korean BBQ located in this same plaza.  Sadly it shut down because it was too authentic. They actually served high grade quality fresh meat served along side other Korean cuisine fair.  They actually incorporated vents built around the grill to suck up all the smoke so you don't leave the restaurant smelling like a grill.  But most of all, the place was not a buffet.    People that are complaining that there's no true Korean BBQ experience in Richmond Hill have only themselves to blame for the demise of the actual authentic KBBQ experience that it once had.  Diners voted with their wallets that they preferred the fake, but Chinese buffet style over the authentic Korean style.    Happy grilling!"}
{"text":"Fish was pretty aweful; waiter never around and when he was it seemed like he was bothered by questions"}
{"text":"Once you get past the gimmick of cooking it at your own table this is probably the lowest quality meat you can get. You will feel terrible after it, i can't comprehend how this place stays busy."}
{"text":"Craving lung cancer?  Go here! We came here last year as a result of the Keg having too long of a wait.  Oh boy do I wish I could erase that night from my memory.I do not understand places like this.  You basically cook your own food, stink yourself up, and the owners of this place are cashing in.  Why not just stay in and cook your own food???  Why do you need to go to a restaurant just so that you do exactly what you will do at home.  COOK!  What a stupid choice this was. I do not know how this place passes health inspection considering their venting system does not vent the smoke out. They serve you Raw meat, so now its up to the customer to meet the health standards and cook it to proper internal temperature.  Never mind that every utensil and plate that touches it is contaminated.  Do the health inspectors randomly check the customers cooking the raw contaminated meats and utensils?   The meats are all low grade under seasoned.  Their shrimps are full prawns, including heads and legs.  You have to eat it like a savage and peel it yourself.   Their sushi looked like it was made by a blind person without thumbs while being waterboarded.   We had to take showers and quarantine all our clothes and bodies after eating here.  It was so gross.  They want you in and out in a hurry so that they can get more people that were rejected from the other busy restaurants in the area. To sum it up, not one good thing about this place.  Nada, zero!  Not even the water.  Not even their sign.  Not even the servers who all need to learn how to brush their teeth.  Just close down already and open another Keg.  Yes that's right, a Keg right next to the Keg because they are always booked."}
{"text":"LOVE ME SOME KOHREAN BBQz!!!! This place is my #2 favorite (after Kazan). Last time I came it was around 7pm on a Friday and we had to wait 10-ish minutes for a table. Even though they had a whole empty row.... :S oh well, it's worth it. MAKE A REZZIE!  The major difference with Chako compared to other places I've been to is that they have salads, hand rolls, other snacks on the menu. It's really useful while you wait for the meat to cook.  They also have Ox tongue - yum yum yummmmm, and special steak and other meats last time I went. They didn't change the grill at all which was disappointing because it gets dirty pretty fast. Kazan changes the grill every 5 minutes (no joke).  Meat, fish, etc is served in small square containers not on a big platter like Kazan (yeah, I compare every K-BBQ place to Kazan SO WHAT). I found that last time the food took way longer to cook than usual, I ended up eating like 5 order of sushi before I got my first piece of ox tongue down by gob. Sigh...  I think this place is great for groups, birthday parties, first dates with cute chubby girls (take me take me!!) - you name it!!   They also have these barrel things which are thing are full of soju...I hate soju but every time I come I see one on every other table so they are popular!"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot with friends and family in the past but my recent visit made me never want to come here again.  First you only get sushi and some of the nice menu options at certain times so you're paying $20 for fatty meat. They also add 10% gratuity which i think is not deserved at all.  The servers never asked us for our drinks, never filled up our water, never changed the grill, were never around.  The food quality has degraded recently and to end off the \"amazing\" service I was handed over dessert with black hair in it. I called over the server and showed her the dessert and said \"thank you for serving me this hair\" and she didn't even say sorry or ask for another one. She just looked straight at me and took the cup and left.  we'll never come back here again and tell everyone to stay away."}
{"text":"Been to many korean bbqs and used to go here all the time years ago but this last visit was beyond what's normal for a BBQ.  It was so smokey..our eyes were burning and we had to cut the dinner short for fear the baby was having some sort of lung damage!!!  We even took turns with the baby in the entrance way we were so worried. We expected our clothes to smell but this was ridiculous.   The service was horrible. Food was OK but we couldn't relax and rushed to be finished to get out of there. With so many options in the area will not be going back here. ..plus we didn't notice a gratuity was already added and paid extra 15 percent."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Chako since high school and it was my first time going to this location. Considering I don't eat meat, this isn't my preferred place to eat since there aren't many options for me, but had to make the most of it! I went for lunch with family so we had an area set for us. If you haven't been to a korean bbq place before, you basically choose from a list of raw foods (meat, seafood, veggies) and you cook it yourself on the grill that's at your table. For their lunch menu there isn't much to choose from. I was only able to have their fish, calamari, the few veggies and their cold dishes (tofu, bean sprouts, glass noddles, kimchi). Nothing really has any flavour since it's not seasoned, so everything tastes pretty bland in my opinion. Obviously if you eat meat you can disregard this review, but for those that don't, you can still find something to eat if you're stuck going here. But there really isn't any point of coming here if you're looking for a tasty meal!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend yesterday.  The price for all-you-can-eat lunch and dinner has just been increased couple days ago.  Just few comments: - The decoration is nice and the ceiling is high.  The place is very spacious and comfortable just like Destiny, its sister restaurant located next door. - Service is slow (even it was way passed busy lunch hour) but still friendly.  The whole appetizer order was missing and so we need to re-order. - Food quality is average.  We ordered the beef ribs and found they were really good.  Seasoned just perfect and the meat was tender.  Then we ordered one more.  The ribs we ordered again tasted the same but the meat quality was not as good.  This place is not bad in general, I might not go back in the near future though."}
{"text":"I've been to a bunch of Korean AYCE BBQs, and this is probably the best I've been to.  It's a combination of it's roomy seating, and it's selection of foods that keep me coming back.  First to note is that the menus change pretty drastically on the weekends.  You're given a lot more interesting things on the weekend (and charged for it) like salmon, snapper and white tuna sushi, steak, and hand rolls.  I went on a Sunday so I got a chance to try most of everything there.  The little Korean side dishes were alright.  They weren't amazing, but on a good note, the seaweed salad and the Edamame beans were really good.  The Edamame beans were probably the best idea in the world as they make a great snack while waiting for things to cook.  I think I went through about 10 trays of it =/.  Out of most of the \"meats\", I'd have to say that the best ones were probably the ox tongue (nice addition to the norm) and the steak.  Depending on the way you cooked the meat, it was definitely one of my favourite things to have.  I found the ox tongue a nice change to the normal \"beef\" that usually kinda ends up tasting all the same after a while.  The ox tongue was a little bit more chewier.  The steak was also a nice change to the norm.  At first look, you'll notice that the cuts of meat aren't exactly amazing, but just cut off the giant fat pieces and you'll be good.  It is all you can eat so I don't really have a problem with it.  I firmly believe that pineapple is the best thing that has ever touched a Korean grill.  It is amazing all the way through the meal.  As for the other \"vegetables\" I really only got the zucchini, but wasn't too crazy about it.  It's a zucchini, end of story, plain jane.  A nice little twist that you're able to order sushi.  Although it isn't exactly the most extensive menu of it, it's still a nice treat.  One thing I don't really like about the hand rolls however is that they have a TON of rice in them.  More to fill you up... great.  I just usually pick some of it out before I eat it.  And then take one to go when I'm done eating for the night. =)  Another thing that blew my mind was the green tea ice cream.  The last time I had green tea ice cream this good was about 10 years ago.  What makes it good you ask?  It actually tastes like green tea, not vanilla or milk.  I'm not too big of an ice cream guy, but I actually sat there and finished the whole thing.  It's that good.  Now you can say all you want about the food, or the drinks or the sushi, but I think the most amazing part of my experience that night was the fact that the dinner music was by the Backstreet Boys.  AMAZING!!  I hope that you're blessed with the same music I was during dinner.  I hope they do a best hits of chako CD."}
{"text":"I'm confused by the low ratings of this place!   I came with my sister right when it opened and we were seated right away. We got the AYCE dinner and decided to try out the spicy salmon roll and the New Mexico roll.   The spicy salmon roll was mediocre, but the New Mexico roll was a bit of a surprise - it is mostly made of mango! Mango pieces with mango drizzled on top. I particularly don't like fruit with sushi, but if you're a fan of it I would suggest this roll to you.   The meats were all so good! My favorite is the ox tongue, though it only comes with about four pieces per order. If you're with a big group, I suggest ordering multiples of it to feed everyone. I thought the chicken was too salty and the fish fillet too time consuming to care for + very bland. I highly recommend the sliced beef, pork and ox tongue overall!  My service was really great! The waiter was very attentive of our orders and we often got our water filled. They didn't miss a single thing we asked for!  I really like chako and I can see myself coming back for more. I'm giving it a four star because of what I mentioned above about some of the meats."}
{"text":"All you can eat korean BBQ. They have lots of variety of choices all is good. I did not like the miso soup they serve as it did not taste fresh and I had better. The service is nice the place is clean and organized. I will recomend ppl to check out this place they are bit pricy but better quality than other korean BBq. For lunch the choices are limited and the price become not as worth it. Dinner you get better choices for a small price.   The washrooms are very nice they are private place for each individual it's rare to see washrooms like that here days which is very unique. They also serve liquire and bottle of wine which is nice and fit perfect with the BBq mood. I did not like the pork as much not sure why I just thought it could of been better."}
{"text":"My first time to a KBBQ and I loved it! Be warned, it gets quite smoky on a busy night here. Great food, good service and great atmosphere. Very unique way of dining. If you go after 10:30 its $10 less per person which is a good deal for an all you can eat restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant.  You will need to cook your own food.  They have a small selection of meats but their short ribs are good.  They have salmon as well which are always nice to cook on the grill.  They have pineapples, zucchini, green peppers as well.  They include sushi as well but not a large selection.  They put lots of rice to make you really full.  We like to come on the weekends(Fri-Sun) since they have Salmon, shrimp and more sushi. Weekdays you don't get as much selection. Try their cold noodles.  It's nice to go with the hot food you are cooking. Of course ice cream is a great way to end the dinner.  This place fills up quickly.  Be sure to make a reservation if you go on the weekend."}
{"text":"So I came to this place based on my incredible love for the location in Mississauga. I do have to make an important distinction before I start this review: I am NOT SURE whether the reason for the sub par service we received at this restaurant was due to the fact that we were a party of two instead of the regular six, or whether it's just this Richmondhill location. Either way, it wasn't as great as the Mississauga one. The food took more than 30 minutes to come out, despite us having already submitted out orders and everything. Drinks were fast to come out; but it was almost impossible to find the server after food's been served (ex: water refills or to order something else).  As always, the Ox tongue and short ribs were the highlight of this Korean BBQ. Highly recommend these two items. You can also order beef slices to grill and have them with steamed rice (very bland, add soy sauce) and salad (very good and crispy!) to make it somewhat more of a balanced meal.  Don't even bother with the sushi rolls at this place. I believe the Mississauga branch has much better sushi because it shares its venue with Wasabi, so maybe they share their sushi as well? Just a theory, but the sushi over here is once of the worst I've ever had. It wasn't even round, just odd, stale-tasting/looking, square units of sushi. Spicy salmon rolls weren't spicy at all, and every type of sushi rolls we ordered was extremely bland and lacking in terms of flavour. Stick to the meats and you'll be fine, but I do recommend the salad :)"}
{"text":"The place is ok... We've been lucky to have a good server the few times we've been here...   The food is standard Korean BBQ (beef,chicken,seafood,veggies, shortribs).... but I don't get why the short ribs take forever to cook.. and I mean forever!!!! Whenever we come here with friends our order usually consists of beef and short ribs sometimes seafood... but you're waiting forever for the short ribs....  My main issue with this place is the ventilation!!!!  fix the ventilation in that restaurant PLEASE!!! Other Korean bbq places don't have this issue, On Saturday I had smoke coming from two grills all towards me... I couldn't stop tearing.  It's good from time to time but I prefer Grill House across the street."}
{"text":"came here for lunch AYCE. i think it was $12.99 per person?  the selection is very few during lunch time. but thats ok. standard stuff like beef (like), pork, chicken (like), ribs (like), fish (very soft...kinda fake), calamari (very chewy), i also like zucchini and red and green bell pepper.   the side dishes are ok too. tofu, raddish, kimchi and bean sprouts.  dessert only mango/green team icecream. again. pretty standard.  we were sitting at a corner so it's not the easiest thing to get the attention of the wait staff.   i think it's not a bad choice for quick cheap meat AYCE."}
{"text":"I came here today and the bbq just tasted so good. I like the steak ribs the most, they are very fresh. I also recommended the squid as well, it is jelly and soft. They changed the management this year so service is better recently. Overral satisfactory dinning experience and perfect place to celebrate holidays or special vocation with families or friends!"}
{"text":"Horrible! We came here at 2pm for lunch and the manager (man with glasses) told us that lunch is over. I told him the website says lunch is til 3pm. He then said that we cannot eat in less than an hour and refused to seat us. The place was completely empty with only 2 or so tables occupied. We were so upset that we vowed never to come back."}
{"text":"Chako represents a good value for all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ, especially for first-timers. They offer a good selection of items at a good price in a nice atmosphere. It's easy to leave this place feeling overstuffed.  Food quality is very good, although I've had better. All the first-timers I've taken there thought it was fantastic!  The beef short ribs (Kalbi) and sliced beef (bulgogi) are my favourite dishes. The dinner menu offers more items, including some sushi.  If you've never had Korean BBQ, or are new to it, try Chako."}
{"text":"We usually go to the Scarborough location but this one is actually closer to home.  The kids love korean bbq.  Seriously, they put away more food here than any other place.  Your clothes/coat/hair will come out of there smelling like smoke, grease and meat.  Inadequate ventilation, you can see the grease and smoke wafting through the air and sometimes it's actually overwhelming as it caused my daughter to have a coughing fit.  They brought meats that weren't requested.  ie. we never get the fish because it's just too hard to cook on the grill but there it was alongside the meat.  Otherwise, solid food and service."}
{"text":"We didn't know this was an AYCE restaurant until we walked in and looked at the menu.  I've never had AYCE Korean BBQ before so this would be interesting.  This place is among many restaurants in a very busy plaza.  We came here on a Thursday evening and the parking lot was packed.  Chako was pretty full too but we didn't have to wait.  We asked the waiter to bring one of every meat and seafood dish.  We also ordered rice and miso soup.  The short ribs were a little chewy and it would've helped having a knife, but they taste good at least.  The thin slices of beef were good as were the pieces of chicken.  I didn't realize I ate ox tongue until I looked at the menu later!  :-0. Not even sure which dish it was but hey, I don't remember eating anything that taste bad so it must've been tasty.  The fish was very good as was the shrimp, mussels and squid.  We also ordered the California roll and spicy salmon roll.  The sushi was nothing to rave about though but I don't think anyone comes here for the sushi.  Overall the food was very good.  We ate everything that we ordered which was a lot.  There wasn't a single dish that was more memorable than the other but that's not to say any of it was bad.  Everything was tasty and we left full and happy.  The place was nicely decorated and the bathrooms were clean.  The service was ok.  It would've been nice if our waiter checked on us a little more often though.  Also, the flame from our grill burned out a couple times which was kind of strange and we didn't notice until the sizzling stopped and we noticed our food wasn't cooking.  We paid $18 a head and they were kind enough to only charge my 6 yr old son a couple dollars since he didn't eat much.  The green tea and mango ice cream were both delicious!  Come give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Went there last week after not going there for about a year.  It seems to have improved.  THe lunch buffet is very reasonable.  If you're on a low-carb diet and just want to eat meet and vegetables....you can't go wrong with this!!!  And at $10.99 for lunch....it's an incredible value.  And that included ice cream!  I would forgo the beef ribs as they are very messy to eat.  the Fish is hard to cook, but tastes good.  The zuchinni is excellent on the BBQ, but pass on the calamari (gets chewy/rubbery when cooked on the BBQ).  The beef, pork, and chicken are the staples....and you can never have enough of that!  THere are a couple of drawbacks....if there's more than 2 in your group, then you're fighting for BBQ real estate to cook your food.  You also come out of there smelling like BBQ smoke.  Maybe not the best romantic restaurant, but it's up there for me when I do my low carb diet!  I just wished they provided prune juice or something at the end to detox all that carbon we just ate!"}
{"text":"I remember going here about 3 years ago and I had loved this place.  After going to other places though, it is just average now.  The menu has an adequate amount of items but nothing really stands out as being unique to this place.  Service can be a bit slow sometimes and they forget some items at times but it doesn't always happen.  I would not recommend ordering any cocktails here.  I would try this place but I'm sure there are much better options I have not discovered yet."}
{"text":"LOL this place is a joke & possibly a half. The only reason as to why i gave them a star, was because once we walked in they seated us right away. After that? The service was HORRIBLE. There were only like a few of the guys that we mediocre - but overall it was just plain horrible.   The food was great but the only downfall was the rice? There were hard chunks of rice, i thought i was eat rocks.   Not to mention it was my first time as well, so yeah i don't recommend coming to this location."}
{"text":"Never again.  Not only did I walk away smelling strongly of korean BBQ fumes, but I didn't even enjoy the food that much either. The Californian hand roll had lettuce in there wtf.. The pork was meh... The food quality is just subpar. Also, I've never been to an all you can place where drinks are not included -_-  Would I come here again against my own will? Probably not."}
{"text":"Chako is an alright kbbq restaurant, though in my opinoin there was probably nothing that made it stand apart from the competition.   The restaurant looks pretty well renovated upon walking in, but you can definitely notice the overwhelmingly pungent kbbq smell that lingers in the restaurant. Being a veteran AYCE diner myself, I've learned to not wear anything new and special to these type of restaurants, because it's very likely the clothes will get dirty and you'll definitely wanna throw it in the washing machine when you get home.   So I thought were was going to be an actual menu that I can choose my AYCE dinner items, but apparently the tiny stand on the table was all they have to offer. To be honestly I was disappointed because I thought the menu would be bigger since I heard they also serve sushi items. Well in reality they do, just not any of the good kind. There were the usual stuff like salmon hand roll and California maki rolls, but the portion was pretty big and contains too much rice to fill you up, so I suggest skip on the sushi stuff.   For $25 a person during weekday dinner, the meats that you can get include beef strips, short ribs, chicken, pork, ox tongue, tilapia fillet, calamari, and mussels. I like their short ribs and chicken because the meats were tender and had a really good flavour. I find their beef strips too be too lean, which became very hard and chewy when cooked. At the end I got pretty sick from having all the meats because there weren't enough variety in terms of vegetables."}
{"text":"First time at a Korean BBQ.  It was interesting cooking the food, and the short ribs were great, but after the novelty wears of there is not much special and the service was very slow."}
{"text":"Food quality was adequate and had fairly good service. However, the most upsetting part was the lack of ventilation. The room is constantly filled with smoke which made it difficult for me to breathe while eating. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Is it weird that I like to go to restaurants were I have to prepare my own food?  Lol.  I love Korean BBQ. And there is definitely an art about proper grilling techniques. But when you're SO hungry after waiting for a table AND smelling all those delicious cooking smells... that technique goes out the window, you throw that marinated meat on the grill, and get movin'.  Lots of sides. Lots of meat. Even a lot on the non-grill menu. The sushi isn't half bad, my friends. Give it a shot. If you don't mind filling up on little things while you grill, it's a good option.  AYCE! yes please! always get your money's worth. these are tough times."}
{"text":"Something about paying for food and to find out I have to make it myself rubs me in all the wrong places. To add to the misery the service is extremely poor and lack luster. I would only recommend coming here for an experience rather than going for the sole purpose of eating. Coming from a guy who doesn't know how to cook, I find this restaurant pretty pointless and useless to me."}
{"text":"We went there Sunday around 4pm, so it wasn't too busy. It was a group of 8 and I loved our experience. Staff were very nice and attentive, I liked the dinner direction and overall a good experience! Sushi wasn't the greatest, but still satisfied my craving. You WILL come out smelling like bbq so beware. But I recommend this place. We paid about 26.99 for the dinner and it was worth it. The chciken beef and ribs were delicious."}
{"text":"Great place for kbbq, different quality of meats from the Scarborough location, would much prefer to dine here over the sister location. Great decor and definitely high volume. Sushi is OK but it's to be expected with busy places."}
{"text":"An excellent Korean BBQ place tucked into the far end of the East Beaver Creek plaza. You can sort of see it on Highway 7 near the 404.  There's a huge assortment of foods for dinner, though I usually just order everything (with a few exceptions). They have an actual BBQ taste, which I like.  Service is wishy washy, hence why the 4 stars instead of 5. Sometimes it takes a while for someone to change your table cooking plate. The environment is good, very open (not cramped unlike some other places I've been to)."}
{"text":"The food is average and the service is terrible. The meat and fish items are so thick that it takes at least twenty minutes before you can start eating. The servers are never to be found and when you order they can't even crack a smile.   They also add in your tips, which is unfair considering the bad service. You're better off going to the other korean grill place."}
{"text":"How did I not know about Chako until a few days ago? We went on February 14th at 5:00, as a late lunch/early dinner, which worked out very nicely, as we didn't get caught in the Vday dinner craziness. Greeted and seated by a friendy hostess, we were led through the half-filled restaurant to a spacious booth. I found the beef ribs and sliced beef really good! I liked how there were 5-6 different types of veggies on the menu. And pineapple too! It was nice to have the option of sushi. They were pretty thin slices of fish, but that's pretty much all you need, seeing how there is good a variety of meat and veggies. We definitely smelled like bbq when we went home, but that's part of the experience!"}
{"text":"So, if you come here, bring an empty stomach, because this is all you can eat. A good non-Yelp friend of mine recommended this place, saying this plus going to Cafe Demetre afterwards was the ultimate in \"filling yourself until you're sick\" dinner and dessert experience.  I figured why not?   Lee and I were lucky to get here right before the dinner rush, so at about 5:30 on a Saturday. We were quickly seated, and the grill was lit. Neither of us had been here before, but the server didn't really seem to care, he just asked us what we wanted.  The menu is pretty self explanatory, so we just dug in and ordered. The sushi rolls were ... okay, a little bit dry, nothing too exceptional, and very rice-filled.  The meats were quite good, though, particularly the beef and steak. They're really thin and nice and well marinated, and after a quick turn on the grill, it's nice and tasty. The prawns are a little bit more work, and take a bit longer to cook, so only if you really really love prawns. The lamb and pork is quite good as well, and the veggies are nice and fresh.  So, overall a great time and good food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening with family. I've been here once before. First of all, this place was filled with smoke from the grill. Wondering if their ventilation system isn't working properly. I've heard people choking and actually my little nephew was choked up from the smoke himself and had to leave early. I wouldn't recommend taking children here. As for the food, it was ok. It lacked flavour and actually last round of thinly sliced beef did not taste too good. Appetizers were very limited. Too many times I had to call on a waiter as the booths are divided with tall walls so I guess it makes it hard for the waitresses to see. This wouldn't be my choice of \"Korean BBQ\". Better choice would be Korean Grill house."}
{"text":"ummmmm sooo I think this place reuses their meat if uncooked because for a lot of the meats that we told them we could not eat, without hesitation the server immediately says no problem and takes it back to the kitchen....we had several dishes of uncooked meats where only half was leftover was taken back to the kitchen by the server, so it leaves me to suspect that they reuse the meat.....so that leaves that  if you ought to know this is not an authentic Korean bbq place as its clearly owned by Chinese people...their meat choice is either chicken, beef or pork and when you goto a authentic Korean bbq place in ktown, they definitely serve more than just those meats...for the price you pay its not worth coming here, the sushi tasted terrible as the rice overpowered the tiny little piece of fish in the sushi....the only good thing about this place was the unlimited green tea ice cream.....good bye chako, you will never take a dollar from me again"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few years back and figured since I was hella hungry I would come back.  After all the first experience was good.  I was really craving Korean BBQ but I was about to get the biggest disappointment of the night.  After placing our order we shortly got all the usual snacks like bean sprouts, tofu, kimchi, etc.  Then the meats were brought out along with a couple of bowls of rice.  Also ordered some sushi and handrolls.  Noticed something was missing with my BBQ so I asked for Korean BBQ sauce.  The server tells me all they have is soy sauce and siracha.  What kind of Korean BBQ place doesn't serve their meats without it?  Oh and that was just the beginning.  I tasted the tofu expecting it to taste as I remembered and got a mouthful of stale food.  Not only was it cold but it tasted like few days old tofu.    Oh and to top it off they forgot about my sushi and handroll order.  I mean if it was busy I could understand the server might have missed it.  There was 5 tables being served including  mine!  After my soy sauce drenched, stale tofu, late arriving sushi I kindly asked for the bill.  Looked at the receipt and saw that there already is a 10% service charge!  It's like they know their service and food is mediocre but there's nothing you can do about it.  Enough of my rant about this location.  Never going back here again.  It's definitely worth the drive to the other Chako located at Midland and McNicoll."}
{"text":"I went here for Valentine's day dinner because we refused to wait 60-75mins for a seat at The Keg.  We got a table almost immediately even though the hostess said 25 minutes.  The place was very nice, and not at all dirty and cramped like many Korean BBQ places.  We took our sweet time grilling the meat because it was such a comfortable setting and the grill was keeping us warm.  My only complaint is that I wish I had a larger stomach to fit all the food!  The dinner menu was huge with both KBBQ items and Japanese items.  There was no way for us to try everything.  I think it might have been better if we came there with more people so that we can grill a larger variety of food.  We had the pineapple calpis drink and Japanese green tea - they were both delicious.  They were so good that I don't even mind that they charged 99 cents for the green tea, which I thought was free.   Another must-try is the pineapple.  It's so good when grilled lightly!  At the end of the night we had 2 small trays of meat and 2 full bowls of rice left on our table and they didn't mind at all.  They just cleared the table."}
{"text":"\"Chako, Never again!\", said all of my friends.   They were the ones who suggested the place and brought me here too, as it was my first time (and probably last time) eating here. My friends previous experience was good which is why we all came here for a friends birthday.  Parking - Free: The Parking lot is HUGE as the location is basically a restaurant haven with a bunch of other restaurants around it, however finding parking is really tough despite the big parking lot. This plaza is usually really packed on a weekend.  Environment: This is where the 1 star comes from, the ventilation in this korean BBQ joint was poor, there was smoke covering the entire place, it felt like being in a smelly sauna. No fans, no A/C....nothing and it was a hot summers night too. We got our fill from water because most of us were dehydrating in there. I would consider this a health hazard.  Food: Well, korean BBQ is korean BBQ there's not much to write about here, as a vegetarian there are options for us. Like the hand roll sushi, zucchini, mango and tofu.  Staff: For the most part the staff serving us were attentive and good. But one server forgot me and my friends order for one of the rotations, where we waited over 20 mins+ to get our hand rolls/sushi."}
{"text":"Went there with my girlfriend on a Thursday night.  Both of us got the all you can eat.  Pros: + nice ambiance + tasty grilled meat  Cons: - horrible service - bad sushi - not great for large groups  Service: (2/5 stars) When we walked in, there was nobody at the hostess desk.  After a while a manager walked by us twice before finally talking to us.  She told us the booth will be ready in a bit and walked off.  (Half the diner was empty, but it makes sense to keep everyone in one part of the restaurant).  After 10 minutes a waitress came and walked us to our seats. She managed not to say a single word to us at all.  I did not realize she was there until my girlfriend stood up.    When we go to our table, the waitress came by to take our order.  She also was trying very hard to say as few words as possible.  We placed our order grilled meat, a few soups, and sushi at that time.  The meat came right away.  The sushi however did not arrive for at least an hour, after 3 reminders they finally brought sushi.    They were really fast for getting kimchi and tofu, but we had to continuously look for them for more water...  We also asked for them to change the grill, she came looked at it, poured water underneath it and was about to leave before I asked her again.  Also the price was more expensive than on website (see pictures for updated price)  Food (4 stars) We tried lots of things so we will go from bad to great. Sushi (1 star): we ordered a shrimp handroll - there was barely any shrimp in it. We also ordered spicy salmon roll - it had tons of rice, and was simply not tasty.  Grilled Food: Pork: 3.5 stars Shrimp: 4 stars - however I would advice against getting it since it is a pain to clean them. Beef: 5 stars -  we added teriyaki sauce on it while we were cooking it.   Calamari: 5 stars - really great, make sure you cook it for a while Short Ribs : 5 stars  Miso Soup: 5 stars Salad: 3 stars - very thin slice of tomato and lots of green salad.  Green tea was an extra $1.    The final cost came to $50 with tax and 10% tip.   Ambiance: (4 stars) It is a modern ambiance. Half the place are open table, and half are booths.     Overall, I would go there again but would not get any sushi and expect service to be quite bad."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday at 5:30pm reservation.  Pretty empty at this time. Good size place with lots of seating. Talk about seats... the chairs are low back chairs, so you can't lean back, pretty uncomfortable after eating an AYCE. The place is clean enough, Washrooms are all separate, which is nice and private.    Now to the food. Just ask for everything, and they bring small square plates of everything to your table. You just have to order separately for the japanese selection. If you came here for the japanese, wrong choice!! Hand Rolls were filled with rice, with a small piece of salmon inside. Spicy salmon roll, was not really spicy.  Not sure if they were using japanese rice, or they mixed it with too much regular rice. So the sushi here is for the Non-sushi fan.  On to the food. If you like cooking and can tell when meat and chicken is done without overcooking the food, then this place is for you. If you are guessing if the food is cooked, then you are just like 90% of us, hoping we cooked it right.  Its pretty sad, eating uncooked or overcooked/burnt food for a whole night, and its all your fault, no one to blame except you and who you are with.  Service... Its a hit or miss, and another miss, and a hit. We had 3-4 people serving us at one time.  This was because, we order from one waiter, the some dishes didnt come, so we flagged down and order through another waiter, then ask another for more napkins and a knife, and it doesnt come, so we flag another waiter and ask for it again, and on and on. So be happy if you get something you ask for, the first time. if not just ask and ask and ask again.   My review is  4 stars for selection of BBQ food, and if you can cook it right. 2.5stars for the sushi 2.5stars for service 2stars for walking out of there smelling like bbq/smoke"}
{"text":"It is a great Korean BBQ place! Food here are fresh, and there have variety of food choice! They also have large table for big groups, it is a Gd place for gathering! They also have drink special everyday. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"My fiance's family and I came here for another holiday feast! All you can eat Korean BBQ with additional sushi + side dishes! I'm not much of a meat eater so I really appreciate that they had fish and some seafood options. Their white fish was really good and their butterfish sushi was yummy! I spent most of the time just eating grilled veggies.. and saved my belly for scoops and scoops of ice cream! The first 2 scoops of green tea ice cream came out more of a .. milk shake. I guess the server was just too overwhelmed by how busy it was and forgot my ice cream for a while. I also tried their mango pudding and mango ice cream... both delish! I just kept going back between mango and green tea.  A solid ayce and will return :)!"}
{"text":"Chako's a Korean BBQ restaurant (ie: you get a grill and cook meat/veggies) with a menu containing Japanese food as well.  They take reservations for groups of four or more so if you're planning to go in a smaller group, make sure you go before 6:30 if you want to guarantee yourself a table.  And trust me, they get busy.  There are always lines waiting at the door when I leave.  I don't think they have a time limit as I've never been kicked out before.  The food itself is pretty good.  I go usually to just eat meat so I can say that I love their beef, pork, chicken and lamb (this one's only offered on the weekends, along with a few other items).  The list of food you can order's pretty long but I just order these, along with rice and miso soup.  Most of the servers are pretty happy to serve you.  I've had times where it'd be hard to flag someone down for the bill or additional food but they're generally pretty good.  Something I do appreciate is they make sure your drink is filled up.  Of course, no place is perfect.  If you're one of those people that go around prime-dinner-time, be warned that parking is dreadful.  I've mentioned this in my Destiny review, but because of all the restaurants around the same parking lot, finding a parking spot can take a lot of time.  So, like I mentioned above, go early!  Something of note is that this place is pretty expensive.  Dinner on Mon-Thursdays is $21 and $24 on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and holidays.  Then there's extra for drinks and of course, tax and tip.  They also tack on an extra 10% as \"service charge\".  They added this very recently (as of January 2016) and I'm a little curious why.  They can afford to because they're always busy but I wasn't impressed by seeing this after they didn't have it for years. It can be very expensive.  If you want lots of food on a grill and Japanese food, I could definitely recommend this place.  It's a fantastic place to eat and it's not too busy, assuming you don't go when everyone else does on the weekend.  So go and eat lots of meat!  And be prepared to smell like it once you're done!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of meat but there was a lot of variety for all! We ordered soup, seaweed salad, veggies, ice cream (not much selection mango or green tea)  Meat: We must've ordered everything on the menu... or so it seemed. Pork, chicken, beef, lamb, ox tongue. I highly recommend the ribs :)  Everything was marinated and very tasty.   Seafood: The salmon was also great but I had to keep flipping it or it would get stuck on the grill. I also loved the mussels! yummm :) Plus it was easy to cook.   Sushi: We also ordered some rolls (California & Spicy Salmon). They weren't that great but hey this isn't a Jap AYCE. They also offered other Jap food but we didn't try them.   Grill: Can't help but admit I am petrified of it due to an incident long ago. But no burns thankfully :) Depending on what might have oil in it, the flames will be stronger.  Price: The price was def. not too bad (meal, one beverage, after tax and tip our bill came to approx $28 per person).   Attire: Do not wear your favourite sweater unless you want to smell like a BBQ grill or want to spend some $ at the dry cleaners :)   Decor/Ambiance: Mod & clean. What more can u ask for?   Service: fast & friendly. Someone always took away any used plates, filled our drinks quickly, etc. At times though they might not understand you. My friend asked for Red Bean Pudding and got red peppers for dessert lol Reservations a must unless you don't mind waiting at least 30 mins during peak hours.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not bad place at all.  Out of all korean bbq places, this has a much better look to it.  But then again - it is still korean bbq."}
{"text":"Aweful customer service! Not worth the 24.99 for the \"all you can eat\"! They also charge you 10% service fee for 2 people. I will never go there again!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some clients who's office is in the area. I'm a frequenter of korean bbq places in LA, and this one doesn't hold a candle to anything in California.  No banchan no chadol, bulgolgi, or samgyeopsal  no rice paper or sauces (other than standard soy sauce) the salad had a heavy dressing, which wasn't very tasty the meats weren't marinated very well the rice wasn't fresh and wasn't even warm the soup didn't have any tofu in it the ice cream had frostbite and was very stiff  Easily the worst korean bbq i've ever had, and I lived with Koreans for 2+ years so I've been to a lot of them."}
{"text":"This place has the most disgusting customer service! We were a party of 5 and went to eat late night, and one of us if a vegetarian and asked the server is she could get pineapples (they offer this on the dinner menu, not the late night) they explained it was only for dinner. She said she did not mind paying extra to just eat and would be happy to do so, the server still refused. He called the manager over and starts speaking in another language. The manager then says she'll give our guest two small trays of pineapple for $18?!!!? Then says we lied when we said the full party was eating and attempted to force us to a smaller table and yelled at the party. This is absolutely disgusting. Will NEVER come back here. On the plus side KOREAN GRILL HOUSE down the street was where we went and they were exceptional. Really recommend them!!!"}
{"text":"The seasoning  on the meats was great.  I really liked their kimchi and their tofu.  I was really impressed with variety of food that came with the dinner.  I was at the Korean Grill in downtown toronto once and I was not as impressed as I was with this place."}
{"text":"I like Chako not only because I love Korean BBQ, esp they have sushi as well.  Although their sushi is not the best in town, still good enough for a \"all u can eat \" restaurant.  I wanna dine at Chako mainly because of the pineapple.  Usually the pineapples r very sweet.  Everytime I must have 3-4 plates."}
{"text":"Good food. All u can eat + sushi + ice cream for around 20 dollars. Service was good except for one server who expected us leave and tried to push us out while we were eating ice cream. She gave us back our bill while we were eating, took away my boyfriends unfinished ice cream and said \"you can go now\". Ruined the whole dinner."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was standard. I dined right before last call so we ordered all our food at once. What disappointed me the most was that our server did not mention there was a 10% gratuity added to the bill, so I tipped an additional 30% on top of the bill. When I handed him the cash for the tip he looked at me funny but still kept silent. After we finished dining I had asked if there was a gratuity added to the bill he mumbled yes. If I had known that there was a gratuity, it would've been a better experience. Not to mention he didn't even present the bill to us... Just a tad disappointed considering I'm a server myself. It wouldn't have changed my heart to tip additional, it just would've been nice to know."}
{"text":"If I could give this a zero star I would but this app wont let me. Today is Saturday June 27th went to this location at 12:50 and it was dead only 2 tables with 5 people in total. I walked in asked for a table with 2 burners due to allergies. I was told NO. Apparently their policy stated that to get 2 burners you need to have 5 or more people, they couldn't prove that. IT WAS COMPLETELY DEAD AND THEY COULDN'T ACCOMMODATE SOMEONE WITH ALLERGIES? Is this even legal? All I know is that this place is horrible!! And will never come back to this place and I'm sure social media would LOVE this story!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Chakos. I find that it's always clean, the service is quick, and the food is good. Some people have had issues with getting the staff to replace the grill...I've never had an issue with that. Chakos has always been wonderful. If you want KBBQ in Richmond Hill, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"My friends brought me to this Korean Barbecue for dinner. Monday's business was good, but not as good in the weekends. Beef and pork with bones here were good, but as the price was based on head count, so the dining room is restricted or the waiter will only change the cooking net once. They say the place used to do it twice. So the business must be good. However the service is a bit lousy."}
{"text":"This Chako in Richmond Hill - SUCKS. The Service is sooooo horrible, I don't understand how! We came here for dinner after doing an escape room in Markham on Woodbine. All of us were really hungry and didn't want to drive too far.   Walked right in, it was nice to be seated right away. Our server, had a note pad and he was super weird. He came and put some side dishes on table and then looked at us and waited for us to order. We didn't want to put our order for our food yet but wanted to take our drink orders- okay.... One ginger ale, one wine, one green tea and one water. Guy comes back with two ginger ale and keeps looking at us like we're wrong. We didn't order the second ginger ale. The guy HAD a NOTE PAD and how did he already mess up our drink order??   When we wanted to order the food, we wanted three trays of everything. We were a group of seven adults, they brought 2 of half the amount of things listed. Sign. We wanted extra bean sprouts and kimchi, they brought only one dish, same small portion. They honestly look like they are super busy but they are not really doing anything. They're just moving so fast to avoid being a good server.   We ordered sushi and someone's HAIR was in it. Not ours because the hair was looped into the roll. Disgusting! And they took forever bringing our new order and refilling our water. It's an all you can eat buffet with US already doing the hard part-cooking our food. The least that they could have done was keep up on our drinks and food order.   Advice for the servers, if you really hate your job as a server, get a new job! Happier servers make better tips!   TIP: If you have an extra 20 minutes, BEST TO DRIVE to the Chako in Scarborough on McNiccol. It is 10 time better- I SWEAR. The food is better. The SERVICE IS BETTER. The WAITERS and WAITRESS IS SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER in every way. Seriously. Just drive to Scarborough."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN.. decided to go there with a large group of people as a fun outing after a great night of bowling.. and sadly our table of 18 people all were disappointed with our time at Chako's! Esp with all the rave about this place i was so excited and i'm completely disappointed. The WORST wait staff i've ever experienced in my life. One server actually yelled at us for asking him for help! extremely rude and half the things ordered didnt even come to the table! NEVER GO THERE! the food isnt worth the terrible wait staff and service! i wish there was the option of a zero out of 5.. but this will do! BE WARNED."}
{"text":"The items on the menu seem impressive but food is just okay. My kids like it so we return because it has both sushi and Korean BBQ but the sushi is not fresh. The whole place is smokey so you can't go anywhere afterwards because your body hair clothes and jacket smells like BBQ. You need to immediately go home and shower and throw all your clothes in the washer. I hope I don't have to return here soon."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a couple friends and lemme tell you when our waiter was never around. Had to get another waitress or waiter to bring us food and to get refills on drinks. Everything else was great, I guess this place is known for its horrific service, but when you tell him 3 times, and look into his eyes you'd think he'll bring a pitcher of water.   There's no ventilation over your table so the place does get really smokey and your clothes are going to smell like BBQ, you won't notice till the next day. The beef, pork, chicken, ribs, man oh man so delicious!  This place is awesome for the food but the service really needs a talk with management."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I don't lole the Chako location in scarborough but my mim wanted to try this location. And it's even worse. The servers don't write down your orders or listen in my opinion. You say 3 orders of somethig and they give you 6 probably because they think you'll order again and it'll save them a trip. But nope, it was all sent back. The utensils were cheap and flimsy. I didn't think I'd comment on cutlery but my fork was literally flat and I couldn't pick up any food. The sushi wasn't even sushi... it just seemed like they were crushed and the rice/seaweed wasn't good either. The grills didn't cool the food fast enough like other korean bbq i have been too. The ventillation made the entire restaurant smokey. Seriously, I had a horrible experience."}
{"text":"I hate this Chako. The service is very bad and the grill is never properly scraped off. I would not recommend it, as the ambiance in the restaurant is very loud and the smell is unbearable. The smell will haunt you for a week and cling onto your clothes. The ceiling fan in the restaurant does not help..."}
{"text":"Update on recent visit on 17/03/17   Came back for the fair price and Ox tongue. Service is a little bit better than last time (They did not ignore me this time). For this visit, I noticed that 10% service fee was automatically added to the bill today, although there was just me and my friend (2 people). I am fine with the 10% service fee, however I was little bit surprised because service fee is usually added for a group of 6 people.   Again, I think the price is fair for the selection offered. Nothing really change about the food, it is still very decent, in my opinion. I only came back for the Ox Tongue so nothing is really special about this place. I just hope that they could marinate the meat a little bit more so it could be more tasty.   I will recommend this place if you just need BBQ fix.  -------------- Be reminded that this is not really Korean BBQ. It's just a regular (Asian) BBQ. 1 star for service because servers will try to avoid you. I ordered kimchi 3 times and they finally brought it on the 4th time.  3 stars for the food because it's decent. The only thing I like here is the ox tonge.  Don't even bother ordering sushi. It's just thick layer of rice covers a tiny little amount of salmon/stuffings.  They have late night special that may be a good deal for your BBQ fix."}
{"text":"Would highly recommend this place. There were lots of choices from beef to calamari lots of veggies as well. They have different types of hand rolls and sushi.  Very clean. Bathrooms were clean.  We had a lot of fun"}
{"text":"I never really have the appetite to come here but once I get here I end up eating everything. Personally, I've only had good experiences here - staff was friendly and helpful, service was fast and the quality of the food was pretty decent and well seasoned. From what I hear it can be really hit or miss but I personally have not experienced the horror stories that I've heard from some people.   I wouldn't eat the sushi here since its not a sushi restaurant but you can try it at your own risk. I cooked everything because I was paranoid. All the other dishes aside from the BBQ meats were all pretty good as well so no complaints.   Only downside of coming here is your clothes smell like bbq afterwards :( Granted, Chako is better than other places I've been to in terms of ventilation but I still wouldn't wear anything too nice.   Its a fun place to try once in a while when you're heading out with friends for something casual or if there are a lot of carnivores in your group :)"}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I's go to place when we're craving barbecue. We come so often, the managers and the late night staff recognize us. They're also very accommodating when it comes to seats - I prefer booths because of a back problem and it's hard for me to sit on the stools. Most days there's a not too long of a wait time especially after 10pm when it's cheaper. The food is amazing and it's really worth what you pay for for my liking."}
{"text":"You would end up smelling like smoked barbecue. Lots of choices on the menu. Won't be returning anytime soon as I wouldn't like to smell like smoked barbecue, but it's good to try out."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to leave a review, but I thought I need to parrot some things.  To get this out of my chest first (excuse the pun), when you walk in there, it seems like a conspiracy to arson is at play. The place is literally FILLED with smoke and my body instantly become lathered with grease and it was so hot. Noting the lack of ventilation to suck up the smoke, it wasn't even busy when we arrive (11:30pm) with only a few tables occupied. It leaves you to wonder where all that smoke is coming from. What an uncomfortable setting.  Service. What service? The guy sat us down and disappeared for 10 minutes, to the point where I have to stand up to get noticed. Keep in mind it was late and not busy here at all - it leaves you wondering if they're just sitting around scratching their behinds. If you're looking for service, order takeout and the delivery driver will give you better service. The probability of this is so high, I'm willing to put a wager on it.  Unbelievable. Had to dry clean my leather jacket after only wearing it a week.  Don't misunderstand, the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because I always enjoy bbq, whether it's here or in my backyard. And the ice cream was fine."}
{"text":"I Love having Korean BBQ when I'm  bored and hungry!  I've never had to wait for a table here- Even during peel hours! There are so many waiters it's amazing! Someone is always near by to help! They don't really speak amazing English so they might end up bringing you something wrong but.. it's all you can eat and they don't charge you if you waste !! :) so it doesn't matter anyways. But I've always wondered where does the extra meat go..  They have large tables for big groups and so many booths for couples and friends!  There's all you can eat sushi, sea food and meat .. can't forget to mention dessert as well!"}
{"text":"Too bad service. The foods are so so but the service is too too bad. I felt they kinda racist. There were a group of people sit at the opposite table, they got their services quick and smile but us got ignore. We paid 10% of the service after tax. It seems like not too right  when we did not get what we paid for. This is my first and last time in this place."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night, with a group of friends who'd never tried Korean BBQ before - big mistake.   This place is disgusting. Upon entering the restaurant, you can see the place is filled with smoke. It was hard to breathe in there, because the smoke was so thick. There is no ventilation whatsoever, and it reeked of smoke/grease.  There were grease spots all over our table, which had already been wiped down. We asked them to wipe it down again, and they did so reluctantly. Even after the second wipe down, the table was still filthy.   The group before us had apparently spilled grease ALL over the floor. The servers didn't even notice/bother to mop up the grease before showing us to our table. We almost slipped because the floor was literally covered in oil. After trying numerous times to flag down a server, we finally managed to find someone to mop up the oil. They did so unwillingly, or so it appears.  The service is terrible. After seating us, they didn't even bother bringing us any menus (drink menu or full menu with pricing details). We waited 20 minutes for our waters, which we ordered as soon as we sat down. We finally got them after asking a different server.   They never came to refill our drinks. We had to ask multiple times, and wait about 15 minutes before they would change our grill. Never once did our server come by to ask if we needed anything. It was hard enough to get anyone working there to even acknowledge you (until it was time to pay the bill, of course).  Sure, they charge a 10% service charge on their bills, but the servers can at least pretend like they care about the customers. This is just really disappointing and unprofessional.   I don't really have any comments about the food. You'd have to try pretty hard to screw up raw slabs of meat. The sushi was mediocre; the dessert was disappointing.   It's also way overpriced for what you get (raw slabs of meat that you cook yourself, with very little variety). I can think of a handful of other AYCE places that have way better food, and probably costs less.   Overall, a waste of time and money. I have never disliked a dinner experience so much before. I don't remember this location being this bad. In fact, at some point in time, Chako was considered one of the better AYCE Korean BBQ places - what happened?  Now I'm left with a sour taste in my mouth, and this disgusting grease/smoke smell ALL over my clothes/hair/skin that refuses to wash off. Definitely won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The food is really tasty and I find myself returning at least once a month despite the fact that my clothes need to washed 3x before the smoke smell comes out.   Very nicely seasoned meat, I stick to the beef which never disappoints. Service could be better but you do feel for the waiters as they're not really set to a specific table. 4/5 and I'll keep returning, especially for the late night."}
{"text":"3.5 starts*  Eh.  This place is neither bad nor good - certainly nothing to write home about. It's been a few years since I've had Korean BBQ so my hopes were perhaps too high, especially given the abundance of hype my boyfriend had given this place. The food, for the most part, was delicious, but the grills were painfully inconsistent in temperature. The kimchi could have afforded some more time to ferment, although I can't confirm whether or not it's store bought or made in house, so that's left to the perspective of the consumer. It took almost 15 minutes to render off fat on some very small ribs. Given the inconsistency of the grill, we vetoed ordering any chicken and stuck to the beef (which was a table favourite) and the pork. Our waiter was polite enough to deal with, and while not particularly bubbly in demeanor, was diligent with the service. Who I believe was the manager sitting at the front of the restaurant was a bit of a severe woman who seemed to have a perpetual scowl on her face anytime I made eye contact with her...maybe not the first face you want to see when you walk in to enjoy a meal. All in all, if I had to, I'd come back - but, I think I'll try my luck with a few other Korean BBQ establishments first."}
{"text":"Horrible service....snarky eye rolling servers that can't get a simple order right...the ventilation system is dumb. The room fills with smoke and you'll smell like it for days. Not worth it for subpar Korean BBQ"}
{"text":"I hate this Chako. I've been here a couple of times and the service is atrocious. Food is decent (it's hard to screw up pieces of raw meat...). No point talking about the food side since everyone else has wrote about it.   We came for the late night dinner and the hostess sat us down and it was 30 minutes to close. It didn't seem like an issue and we asked when was last call. The waitress told us she will come around close to 12 and will ask us one last time. So at first it was ok, and we received our food in a timely manner but she gave us food we didn't order. It was such a waste of food because we didn't ask for the extra 7 dishes she gave us. After that, she never came back again until the end. We had various waiters that filled our glass but for literally a good 15 minutes we never saw a waiter again. We asked a waiter to change our grill, and for 10 minutes he didn't come back. We realized it was past 12 and no one had asked us about last call and when he came back, we asked and he's like \"yeah, it's done\" and walked away. We're like what the hell, because 2/3 of us still wanted more dishes. At the end of our meal and when they wanted us to leave in a passive way, the original waitress came back and asked us to pay. I told her she didn't tell us about last call and she basically shrugged it off and blamed the hostess but c'mon.  Unimpressed and frankly annoyed at the service I've had here (previous experiences have been similar). They automatically charge 10% service charge, which is way more than I would \"tip\" for this garbage. Go to the Chako in Scarborough or the Korean Grill House on hwy 7 instead. Service at both of these places are much better and seem like they actually care about their jobs."}
{"text":"This place is huge and they have a great selection of Japanese and korean food for the bbq.  Their sushi are below mediocre but  you're really there for the korean bbq which is great!   Their service is mediocre but if you want to go with a big group that's somewhat clean this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend on Valentine's Day this year. We had a reservation so we got our table right away but other people were waiting at least 30 minutes.  It was both of our first times having Korean BBQ so didn't really know what to expect.  The all you can eat menu was good..lots of meat and fish options and a few sushi options.  The sushi came first, wasn't overly amazing but didn't expect it to be because that's not what they're known for. The miso soup was awful though, very watered down, and we ordered shrimp hand rolls that consisted of a tiny piece of shrimp and way too much rice.  Then the raw stuff came. We got chicken, beef, shrimp, salmon, calamari and all the veggies offered.  Cooking on the table was a cool experience but you have to be very attentive especially since different foods take different amounts of time to cook. The beef was definitely my favourite. The salmon was good but was a bit of a mess because it would stick to the grill.   We were very full by the end but ate ice cream for dessert.   Was a cool experience but not something I'd do all the time. Decent dinner prices too. Was about 27 each with tax.  Also another thing was we had to shower right when we got home because we stunk like the place. Including our phones!!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE PERIOD. Decided to give this place a try again after several years and boy did it disappoint. It was so bad that I didnt even eat and just walked out.   We made a reservation for the family for a table of 6 at 730pm. We arrived 5 minutes early and advised that there will only be 4 people dining due to my brother bailing out. Its worth noting that at this time the place was maybe at 30% capacity, the manager told us to wait and that the next table was ours despite having larger tables available. We waited 10min before asking him again and his tone now changed to \"I dont know, when someone leaves.\" We asked could we not jus take one of the 6 seat booths that were available to which his responded \"but you only have 4 people, the next table that finishes is yours\". I can understand not giving us a table when its super busy but this place was only at 30% capacity. Needless to say we walked out.   No wonder everyone complains about customer service, even the manager doesn't even know how to service customers properly."}
{"text":"Came in search of Korean BBQ down to the East Beaver Creek area and stumbled on Chako.  Fairly large Korean BBQ (cook your own food at your table) all you can eat.  Prices were reasonable... think 22 dollars for large selection of all you can eat including sushi.  There was nothing overly wrong with this place, but nothing really great either.  Service was friendly, but slow.  Food was reasonable, but nothing outstanding.  I would recommend against the sushi.... while it was AYCE, I don't really feel that it was good quality.  Maybe that was to be expected.  We ate much and had to roll ourselves out the restaurant at the end of it all, but probably would not be back."}
