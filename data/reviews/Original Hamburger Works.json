{"text":"Cozy neighborhood sports bar w good burgers. Love the condiment bar, the prices, and the old school feel of the place. Nice patio too. Def goin back...."}
{"text":"The bad: the bar closes at 10pm.  It seems like the western, country, wagon-wheel themed bar that you'd like to close down one night while playing some good tunes on the juke box and eating peanuts.  And also the french fries, file those under bad.  The good: the hamburgers are pretty much delicious.  Definitely go for guacamole, and add whatever you want from the topping wagon.  I didn't try one myself, but I hear the cookies are good."}
{"text":"Good food, good vibes, good service. All adds up to a great spot. Got the great big one and zucchini fries. Really tasty burger and fries are delicious. All this for less than 20$, can't go wrong there. It has a full bar and good spot to watch sporting events. Check this place out."}
{"text":"My wife and I were referred to this place by a patio furniture salesman in the area who claimed it has the best burgers in town... yeap.. it is confirmed.. this is an excellent place to grab a burger! Delicious burgers and fresh toppings.  Reminded me of a fuddrucker restaurant style.. but better.. and more local, which I'd the best way to spend your money."}
{"text":"My boyfriend likes burgers...I don't. Not really. I don't eat red meat, usually, and plain old hamburgers remind me of my earnest (but kind of white trash) youth. Not hatin', just sayin'.   My boyfriend's boss raves about Original Hamburger Works, and my boyfriend had been there once before. Tonight, he insisted that we try it together. I was down...I like trying new things, and I have some kind of inchoate desire that I haven't really articulated, even to myself, to try every restaurant in a 10 mile radius of our apartment. I WILL become a minor, pompous authority on dining downtown. I will.   Parking is easy, and the outside is pleasantly run down. The inside is even more pleasantly run down...another page torn right out of the worn tome of my aforementioned childhood. It reminds me of the kind of joints my family used to frequent when I was a kid...a little bit dirty, a little bit smelly, a little bit full of people over the age of forty getting their bump and grind on.   Okay, we didn't sit in the bar area. I just...wasn't down with the hazy, purple-gray mist settled around it in the form of  bad set jobs. I think some of them were knitting lambskin condoms. We opted instead for the regular dining area, which is still dirty and smelly but also conspicuously void of any geriatric sexual activity.   Everything in the restaurant is worn down, and not in a \"faux aged\" way...it's worn. It's chipped. Frayed. Tattered. Etcetera, ad nauseam. I see other Yelpers have been bothered by this detail. I myself was not. In fact...I kind of liked it. Just know that the other reviewers are for real - the place is a bit of a sty.   You walk up, place your order, they call your name, you pick it up, and then you load up your burger/sandwich (for sandwiches are present, too) with condiments at the generous condiment bar. I had the 1/3 pound Hawaiian burger, which is basically a burger with a canned pineapple ring slapped on top of it. The menu indicated that teriyaki sauce would be involved, but I don't think that actually happened. My boyfriend had The Great Big One, or something like that, which is just a regular old burger, but...Great Big. We also shared an order of Arizona Fries, which are startlingly similar to the fries belched out of any other greasy burger place, within Arizona's borders and beyond.   My boyfriend loves the burgers. He counts them among the best he has ever had. I liked it well enough, and I'm sure we'll visit again, but I wouldn't call it \"among the best burgers I've ever had.\" Then again, I don't like burgers, so maybe you shouldn't take my word for it.   Something you can totally take my word for: the honey mustard? Yeah, it's not good. Don't even waste your time filling up a little plastic cup of it to dip your fries in. The ranch dressing, though, is worth pilfering."}
{"text":"Border Burger is great. Onion rings are awesome ( they are like the ones from Luke's of Chicago.) the cookies are very good. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Unimpressed.  The place was pretty run down. The salad bar that you use to top your own burger just seems lazy and the service was horible. The bartender was beyond rude and impatient.  I'll steer anyone I can away from this dive."}
{"text":"Great flame broiled burgers.  Used to be my favorite place, but it is still up there (#2 now).  Has the college hangout feel to it.  Worth a visit if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I had a Garden Burger and fries.  It was pretty darn good.  I liked the condiment bar as I could put whatever I wanted on it in whatever quantity I wanted."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my 19-year old and 12-year old on Friday night before a football game at Phoenix College. The place was HOPPIN'! The kids were hungry and the food hit the spot.   For an order with two Big Ones (1/3 lb burger) and a Double Big One, drinks, fries and onion rings the bill was just over $30.  A bargain in my books! If you want hipster, upscale dining try someplace else. If you want good burgers, yummy fries and onion rings, this is your place. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really like this place. Here's why; LOVE the burgers. In my opinion they are far better than anything I ever ate at FUDDRUCKERS. Also, I eat my burgers well done. Can't stand them even with a little pink in the middle. Any time I eat here, I always get mine well done. LOVE that I can sit in the bar and have a cold one and order a burger too.   Why not 5 stars? When sitting in the bar, service is slow. Bartender seems more interested in waiting on folks at the bar, and less interested in folks in the booths. Also, they are stingy with their fries. For the price, they need to heap those babies on the plate. Other than that, excellent place."}
{"text":"According to my friend, this local bar type place rocks.  Food is always good, it's cheap, atmosphere is great and had a good conversation.  They grill the burgers right in view of you as you're ordering.  They also cook your burgers over charcoal so it gets real flavor in them!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to burger spot. Thick greasy burger on an onion roll with Arizona fries and I'm set! I just don't know the hours. Please post them!"}
{"text":"This is the best burger I have had in Phoenix. Grilled just right, and I get to put the fixing's on. The kids loved it too. They know how to handle a line of customers. We got there right at lunch time. There was maybe 10 in line. It still only took a few minutes. what a great place."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have within walking distance when we need to get our burger fix. I am not a huge burger fan but when I need one this is the place I choose to go. Other than that I usually order the spicy chicken sandwich.  A tender grilled breast smothered in wing sauce. Yum!  An added bonus are the video games, they have a table pac man game and the original super mario brothers.  I recommend the burgers, wings and chicken sandwiches all of them fire grilled right when you order them."}
{"text":"we randomly came across this place driving back from encanto park (where we saw a dog obedience school, which was hilarious).  the interior is caked with old-style saloon type stuff (like an entire wagon where all the sauces were located). they have plenty of specialty burgers (but no veggie burgers). also, on the menu, apparently you can buy this place for $1 million.  i had the hawai'ian burger which was awesome. you can eat at the bar (oh, they also have a full bar and video crack), which has free popcorn from one of those old-school popcorn machines. the fried zucchini and the onion rings were really good as well.   i guess they have horseshoe and some other outdoor games in the back, but we didn't have time to check that out. they close way too early.  the cougar at the bar was nice, but could have been nicer."}
{"text":"Myself and my 7&6 year old  boys really enjoy this place. We get to sit outside and eat her food while playing a good game of bags. The boys and I enjoy the burgers & French fries. Fresh and yum."}
{"text":"In the years passed I would have given this place 5 stars. As writting of this review the neglectful service and food expectation is so bottom basement I can no longer ignore it.  The chicken sandwiches and burgers are no longer consistent. When you order it's a coin-flip whether you get a great sandwich or a freeze dried specimen ready for space exploration.  Besides your server taking the time to explain you will be charged $.50 for requesting ranch dressing unless you self serve... The worst part about The Original Hamburgerworks is any given order of 10 wings will feature two to three broken ones. What a tasty thought... A broken, exposed bone chicken wing or three to wrap your mouth around.  Avoid this place unless you're desperate. Or being held hostage."}
{"text":"The Original Hamburger Works is not too far from where I work in downtown Phoenix, so when a group of us head out for lunch, we occasionally end up here. As the name indicates, they specialize in hamburgers, but they also have chicken burgers as well. The food is good and very reasonably priced. The fries are excellent. The soft drinks you vend yourself, so don't pay for a large cup. Get a small or medium size and keep going back for more.  The protocol is to stand in line and place your order at the window. They call your name over a loudspeaker when your order is ready."}
{"text":"The burgers are good and so are the prices. But if you really want to experience The Works skip the restaurant and sit at the bar. Introduce yourself to whoever is sitting next to you and I *guarantee you'll you have an interesting conversation. Unless you're the one who's not interesting.    *I can't really guarantee anything. Wtf."}
{"text":"Really good. The amount of food is huge. But the workers are really annoying. All in all good."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best burger in town and at a great price! The best part is that my teenager (who is basically a walking stomach) gets full before he even finishes his meal!!   While it isn't the most upscale place you can go to (you bus your own table as the majority of staff is paid to cook the food), it is by far worth the extra effort of bussing your own table and the price is just right. For about the same amount as you can pick up those flimsy, tasteless burgers at a fast food drive-thru you can get a nice, fresh, juicy burger and fries that will actually fill you up and leave you satisfied."}
{"text":"Love the Works! My fave Fri night hang out with family and friends. Great food and atmosphere, and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a classic, simple no-nonsense burger joint. The burgers are perfectly cooked and yummy. My only issue: the long lines during lunch time."}
{"text":"Upon the high marks that this place got I ventured out to try it for myself.  Unfortunately, I found the burgers underwhelming.  Granted, I ordered it for take-out, but the 15 minutes between pick up and consumption shouldn't have caused the meat to be so dry.  Maybe it was the de-humidifier that I was running on the way home that had something to do with it.  I read that the burgers were made to order and they did make the burgers that I ordered, though they didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked.  There too, I'm a dick and you'd want to get off the phone with me too.  But ultimately when I got home the first burger I bit into was very dry.  I can't give a fair review of the second burger because I tried it the next morning off the counter where I left it.  You know what they say about breakfast.  I can say the bun was still good.  Maybe that's where the moisture went.  This review is in no way associated with that experience.  More so it speaks to the fact that I eat anything.   I also ordered onion rings, zuchini and mushrooms.  I ate the rings on my way home and they were good although not plentiful.  The zuchini and mushrooms were ok.  Since it was take-out I can't really elaborate on the decor too much other than salad theft must be a real problem in that neighborhood.  Due to the location (relative to me) and the vast number of other burger options, I will probably not be back.  But that's just my experience, another patron did make a point to compliment the staff on a fine burger on his way out while I was there."}
{"text":"Their grilled chicken sandwich makes my mouth water just writing this. Absolutely the best in Phoenix. The chicken is juicy and oversized . Love the self serve condiment bar to dress your sandwich to your liking. Prices are inexpensive. The beer battered onion rings are very tasty. This place is a bit shabby but who cares because the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I can only really comment on the bar. First of all I went in there around Happy Hour times and there wasn't really any good drink specials. The bartender boasted 4 dollar Mexican beers in a bottle. Not too bad, but most of the draft selection was domestic so I settled on a Pacifico. The bartender was nice initially friendly, but didn't come by to check on me at all.   I don't want to be rude, but the bartender wasn't the most refined individual. After waiting for my check for my single beer, she got in a fight with the woman next to me (who she had completely over served) over the fact that she was taking lemons out of the cocktail tray while she wasn't looking. Which resulted in a shouting match between her and the intoxicated patron.   Prior to getting my check the bartender asked if I knew the guy who was posted at the bar next to me. I did not, so I just shrugged. She asked if I was buying his drink since he had apparently walked out on it. After explaining that he had just taken a seat next to me, she handed me my check and I paid and left as soon as I could.  The service was about as bad as it smelled on the bar side unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is probably the best mom and pop hamburger joint in Phoenix.  It may look like a hole in the wall and dated but the food is good, service is decent and the prices are super-reasonable. I've never had a bad hamburger from here.   If you are a vegetarian or uber-health conscious there is not much on this menu if at all to please you.  The burgers are delicious as are the chicken sandwiches.  According to the menu there are fish and ham sandwich options.  Have not eaten them but they are probably good as well, same goes for the cocktails.  My only concern would be for maybe for them to have salads or healthier options?"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Saturday evening for dinner, it wasn't very busy. The food was good and came out quickly (once given the chance to order.) The 2 star review is bc of the service that my party was given by the 2 middle-aged barkeeps. They have mastered the \"I saw you but I'm going to act like I didn't\" move. I was perplexed when I saw that the restaurant employs younger people.. why aren't they the bartenders? If you're a server and suck at your job, you better at least be good looking. The bartenders at this place have nothing going for them except undeserved pride."}
{"text":"Its so funny I grew up down the street from this place and never knew it existed. But I came there today and was blown away by these awesome burgers. Even the fries were out of this world no katchup need. Great job guys keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience at the Hamburger Works.  Last night, the H.W's hit a new low in poor service and dirty tables.   I had ordered fries with my burger, only to have the burger served w/o the fries.  With receipt in hand, I brought this to the cashiers attention.  She acknowledged the over sight and reordered my fries.   I finished my burger while waiting for the rest of my order.   Which never came!   I requested to speak to the manager.   A guy named Sean seemed totally indifferent about the screwed-up order.   It will be a long time before I will eat there again."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times and the food / service is always consistent.  The only thing I was dissapointed with was that my onion bun was flatter than a crepe and the wait time was a little longer than normal.  Overall, if you are looking for a Phoenix icon to eat at that is a neighborhood classic this is that place. The beer is always cold and the staff is very friendly.  If you get bored, you can go outside tonthe back patio and play a little pong with a beer or soda within arms reach.  Great place to unwind and relax, watch sports, listen to jukebox and engage in conversation."}
{"text":"Great burgers,  very reasonable prices. .. cold beer. They also have daily food specials."}
{"text":"While this place cannot be considered healthy by any means, if you are need of a good ole' greasy burger fix, this place fits the bill.  My sister just recently discovered this place through a co-worker and has been bugging me to go with her ever since.  I was really surprised at how big the space is inside, tons of seating, a bar area and even an outdoor patio with tables and games!  Although I haven't been since I was a kid, I am guessing this is similar to the Chuckbox, order at the counter, and then they call out your number.  After you grab your burger, you head over to a giant wooden wagon that serves as the condiment bar.  It is stocked with tomatoes, ketchup, lettuce, pickles, hot peppers, mustard, mayo...you name it.  One side of it serves as a salad bar, so I guess if you went there and just got salad you consider it a healthy restaurant.  Their main gig is burgers, and they come in a variety of sizes from 1/3 lb all the up to a full pound and with a variety of toppings.  They also have some chicken sandwiches and even a grilled fish sandwich on the menu!  The burger was pretty good, the cheese was melted and I liked that I got to top it off just the way I like it.  But I have to say my favorite thing was the Fried Zucchini and Onion Rings.  I know most things are good once they are fried, but the batter on these was just right, and they were crisp, not a soggy mess.  I scored myself some ranch dressing off of the salad bar and I was in deep fried heaven.  So, while I won't be visiting here every week, every now and then I can see it hitting the spot."}
{"text":"Not bad. The food comes out reasonably fast, and it tastes good. They won't win awards for tastiest burger, but they shouldn't get a last place ribbon, either. If in the area, it's a decent choice for a neighborhood spot. The wings are more buttery than crispy, I would go with the spicy chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"No work Monday afternoon Fat Tire and 1/2 lb classic with a side of rings.... Priceless ..... Only complaint even though it really isn't dirty it just gives ya that feel...... As always great mix of incredibly laid back clientele.....but honestly in the end its just a decent burger in dingy bar......"}
{"text":"Just moved to Phoenix from Ca and have not been able to find a good burger anywhere! Finally I came to yelp and found this place. Thank God because the burgers here are AMAZING!!!!!! I love the inside of the place too it was very comfortable also. My husband and son ordered the #1 and I got the #4 the fries are also amazing too. Oh and you have to try the Bargs vanilla cherry soda, yummy!! Highly recommend and cant wait to go back. :)"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the quality of the food and the decor of the restaurant. To be honest, their simple hamburger was quite small, however the teriyaki burger and such were fairly good. The condiment bar is a nice addition and the fact that you can create your own sodas in the machine is a big plus for the kids. We would go back."}
{"text":"bland.  dry.  underwhelming burger.  sure they have many options but so does fuddruckers and fuddruckers is crap as well.  chicago hamburger co is where it's at.    spent 20 for girlfriend and i ate original hamburger works and won't be doing that again anytime soon.  and that burger was not 1/2 pound.  the only good thing was that they had red cream soda.  by far the most disappointing place i;ve been that i heard about via this website.  thanks for misleading yelpers.  this place doesnt believe in seasoning.  btw.  chili fries tastes like carl's jr's.  100% crap."}
{"text":"Great food!!!  Build your own burger, with a bar!  Love it; and great option for downtown!"}
{"text":"Every time I go here, I get awesome customer service. I love the part that you get to pile on any all the fixins that you want for no extra charge.   The burgers are big and juicy, they also have grilled chicken breasts which are equally as good. I love that you get to pick your type of cheese, and your type of bun. I introduced both my girlfriend and my mom (a few years apart) and both have enjoyed it.   As far as the bar is concerned, I only drink stouts and porters when it comes to beer. They have Guinness available, but only in the bottle. I haven't had any cocktails here as of yet, so I'm not able to report if they're good or not. I'll leave an updated report when I do."}
{"text":"I love this place. Its exactly what I want in a burger place. Namely: - No BS - Very few frills - A good bar in the back - Big portions (like whoa, I need to undo my pants and possibly crap my pants sized)  - a plethora of drinks (not pinata like El Guapo would prefer)  - funky crap on the walls that makes me giggle.  So, you might ask, why only 4 stars? 1. Things do tend to be over cooked. I know the risks associated with eating undercooked meat, but I also know it tastes better. I'll risk moving into the bathroom for 3 days for a tasty burger. 2. Why the \"no firearms\" sign on the door? Ever heard Chris Rock talk about parties with metal detectors? \"Never go to clubs with metal detectors. Sure it feels safe inside. But what about all those niggas waiting outside with guns? They know you ain't got one.\" I carry a gun when I don't drink. I don't like to have to take it off and leave it in the car to enjoy my tasty burger. Don't make me choose between safety and my ever increasing waist line. That's just rude.  Overall, love this place. Go medium rare on the meat and easy on the guns, and we'll bump you up to 5 stars in no time little fella!"}
{"text":"The BORDER burger is delish! Onion rings are fantastic. The cookies, though they look bad, are very good! The service is good too."}
{"text":"Forget the eleventy-hundred trendy foo foo burger places out there. Get yourself to the Original Hamburger Works and order a half pound \"Great Big One\" with a glorious almost crispy charred edge hanging past the edges of the bun. This place has been grilling over an open flame at this location since long before I was born and I hope they are always here!"}
{"text":"Here in Phoenix for vacation. Came here after screwing up directions. Chicken burger was good and service quick."}
{"text":"This place had decent food, but nothing really that special or out of the ordinary. I had to wait a long time to get my food. The salad bar was pretty picked over as well."}
{"text":"Unlike all the burger chains that been popping up around Phoenix, these are Real flame-broiled burgers, not the smoosh it on a griddle until all the flavor has burnt away meat pattie. Not to mention they deliver it at a reasonable price!  My co-workers and I have this one on or regular lunch rotation list!"}
{"text":"Really come on people, I had a thin dry ass over cooked bland hamburger and some undercooked cold fries. Nasty. I won't be going back. Price was right taste was wrong. The biker atmosphere and poorly prepared burgers will make sure i wont be going back."}
{"text":"I give this one star ONLY because the owner of the restaurant was considerate enough to hear my rant about his incompetent workers who could not for the life of me, take down a simple one hamburger plus fries phone order. An apology for my order would have apparently been too much, instead I got a \"are you sure you called this location\"? Ummm... You have another location?? I've had better service at McDonalds."}
{"text":"This is a cool neighborhood burger shop that has a topping bar and lots of cool decor items.  I like the metal tables, and the service is really attentive.  I would eat a burger here over any chain store.  Simple burgers at a good price with lots of choices and great atmosphere.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"One day me and the sis and the cuz were wondering around central phoenix like we usually do... not knowing where to go, I was feeling Pizza A Metro, but the cuz wanted a burger she could sink her teeth into... I was drawing a serious blank when the sis shouted, \"ORIGIONAL HAMBURGER WORKS!\" ARR?? *lil puppy ears raise up in a questioning manner*  She quickly drove us there and it was adjacent to Phoenix College and had a cool Encanto vibe... I dug it. It's right next to this paint ur own ceramic pottery place that seemed so cool! When we entered the works...  It is HUGE on the inside! there are crazy signs from the 40s and 50s and traffic lights and the coolest copper topped tables. I totally dug it's cavernous feel. Ahhh... and the smell!! of fresh cooking meat!! WHOO HOO!!  We had to go through a lil line that reminded me of Castles n Coasters and some of the older Taco Bells... hmmm not so cute. but I can see how it could be necessary... I can just imagine how busy this place gets at lunch time with the college just RIGHT over there!   Their burgers sounded pretty average... terriyaki burger, bacon cheese burgers - there's no crazy toppings that don't make sense like some places... just straight up great burger classics. but WHAT is different about the way the menu looked was that they had a retirement burger?! WTF?? it comes with a boat and a car! sweet!! the perfect sides!! I bet burgers totally taste better on a boat!! Now if only I could get a $1,000,000 to find out if it's true!! But since I couldn't afford the retirement burger, I opted for a 1/2lb patty topped with bacon and cheese. The sis chose a side order of half zucchini & onion rings and the cuz threw it DOWN that night yo!! TWO half pound patties with cheese! I'm not cool enough to hang with that! :(  We went around the corner, through the labrynth and paid we told the chick our name and got our cups, the soda fountain area is so cool! I love the Iced Tea section, there were many options to choose from! Sweetened black tea and green tea, raspberry and unsweetened tea... lovesit! and my sister's happy to see Red Creme soda can be found there too!   When the food was ready I walked up to the wagon 'o toppings and had FUN! I buried my burger with mounds of lettuce, mayo, ketchup and some tomatos and tons of pickles... and when i was all done... I could barely fit it in my mouth! But somehow i managed and it was soo yummy!! Freshy cooked over a fire, it was so great! I haven't had such a good burger in a long time!  my ONLY complaint is that I wasn't sure about the daily meal deals... I didn't see it until the last second! and that the sides are so SMALL!! HUGE ass burgers... lil baby sides! WTF?! and for almost as much as a burger?!?! NOT COOL!!  But seriously, the people are cool and so are the other diners, there were tons of yummy firemen when I we went! Also, the attached bar looks like an awesome place to get drunk in!! It's totally on the list of places to try out! I really enjoyed myself here and got crazy full off of my huge burger and baby side! I still can't believe the cuz could handle a large double burger!! Craziness!! I'll definately be back with more in tow!  To my yelpers: i say go!! and try the burgers and marvel at the round lil circles of bacon atop of a perfectly charred burger! Load up on the toppings (like I did) and try not to bitch about the small sides (like I did) and try each of different types of tea (like I did) and maybe even a beer or two and don't ask a fireman if you can see their hose... (like I did) cuz they just MIGHT! but BOOO!!! They took me out to their truck instead of getting out of their trunks!!"}
{"text":"Love the wood charred flavor on the burgers. Great selection oef burgers, chicken, toppings and fixings from the salad wagon. Mushroom and Bacon is awesome!"}
{"text":"We went to Original Hamburger Works for the second time last weekend. Overall, the food is in impressive, and the service is even worse.   Upon arriving we walked through the dining room and sat in the bar at a table. After waiting several minutes without the server/bartender acknowledging us, we went up to the bar and placed an order. We ordered chicken strips, baked potato, and 1/3 lb burger with fries. We also ordered two Bud Lights, after discovering beer options are limited and what appears to be a full bar is not so full after all.   The chicken strips were more fried batter than chicken, though what chicken was there was not dried out. The baked potato was find. The burger was basic but had little flavor and was a very poor quality meat, as there were small hard balls of fat in many bites. The condiment bar may seem fun, but it includes only the very basics- tomato, lettuce, onion, ketchup, mustard, mayo, pickles, and a few hotter toppings. Good, but not special.   The server never came back to take another drink order. Though it was over an hour from closing time, she spent her time cleaning and stacking unused bar stools.   Overall not a good experience. Fast food would taste better and cost less. The only reason to go is a nearby bar with sports on TVs."}
{"text":"One of the better hamburger joints in phoenix. I always make the mistake of ordering the 1/2 lb with cheese which is way more than i can eat. The Onion rings are delicious!"}
{"text":"Just laid back. A good beginning to a night out."}
{"text":"They have really good grilled food, it's grilled right in front of you and it taste awesome! There's hot dogs, wings, chicken tenders, hamburgers, and salads as well! So there's a variety, the prices are very reasonable between $8 to $13. Decor is awesome and it's great for big groups, they have tables for up to 16. To top it all of the service is nice, they're very kind, and the food comes out pretty quick!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and the fixings bar was fresh, the bacon was cut to cover the entire pattie and the fries were fresh, must go again."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at Original Hamburger Works and was most likely the last.  The employees with the exception of the bar staff seemed clueless.  When ordering and asking the order-taker basic questions about the menu, she would only quickly answer \"I don't know\" with a blank stare on her face.  When picking up my order at the counter, the young man just looked at me when I said thank you.  Not a good way to win over customers.  You must go over into the bar area to purchase alcoholic drinks and for some odd reason, they don't take debit cards after 7 pm.  Strange.  The food was just okay.  Being able to add all the condiments you want yourself is a plus.  I got the Big One while my wife got the Border Burger.  The burgers were well cooked and had a good taste, but weren't outstanding.  We also ordered the half onion rings and fries basket, which was just basic fare.    The deal-breaker came when I went to the men's room after dining.  Upon entering the hall leading to the restrooms, I noticed a foul, sewer-like smell.  After entering the restroom, I was quickly overtaken with the stench.  I've been in port-a-potties that had more pleasant smells than this.    While the concept of this restaurant has merit, it's poorly executed, unfortunately.  It has potential, but obviously lacks good management.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at this time."}
{"text":"Holy front door Batman. This place rocks. I'm a fat kid and the burgers and fixings in this joint rock. You order at the window and the flame that sucker right in front of you and the fries and onion rings rock. You head to the fixing bar and smother that burger up with everything then to the bar for beer and good eats. Well priced and great staff"}
{"text":"Pretty dang good place for a burger. The condiment bar, has all the usual stuff and jalapeno's. A hamburger just NEEDS jalapeno's, you know what I mean?  This place isn't too much more expensive than going to BK or McD, so why not try it out? You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Great wings and the service was superb!! I'll be back there the next time I'm in Phoenix for sure."}
{"text":"Real good burgers. Though they should step into the 21st century and realize that Tabasco isn't the only hot sauce brand."}
{"text":"This place useta be delicious. Over the past year or so it's really gone down hill. Last two visits were two different cooks. Neither of which knew how to cook a burger. This last visit I got a burnt burger (dry and hard) with some ice cold fries. I only gave it 2 stars, because it useta be good. After years of going here, sadly I will not be going back."}
{"text":"A nice little hole in the wall restaurant. Has burgers as small as 1/3 lb to a full 1 lb. you have a choice of 3 different buns onion, white, and wheat. The burgers are good and have a bunch of different sides to chose from.   After you get your burger you have a salad bar of toppings to chose from."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! They aren't fancy, but who needs fancy when you're getting a grilled burger? They have a similar place in Tempe, but when you're not in the mood to go to the East Valley, come here. Cooked to order, fresh toppings bar, unlimited refills, bar to sit and watch games and get alcoholic beverages ... and an outdoor area.  Definitely not a disappointment; and they give you enough you don't need 2 combos ... 1 combo and 1 sandwich is MORE then enough!"}
{"text":"2nd time at this carnivore lovers spot. Co-worker says that this is one of his favorite burger places downtown, so we headed there for lunch. Quaint historical decor. Since I was told burgers were what they were know for, that's what I got. I did the burger lunch special with fries. White, Wheat or Onion was the 1st question asked, followed by the type of cheese. My \"no bun\" request seemed like something that they didn't get a lot of? We got there around 11:30, and they seemed to very quickly get busy. Waited a bit for our food, but what came out was hot and fresh. I loved the fixings bar. Lots of fresh items for you to dress your order. I would have liked to see leaf lettuce instead of shred, but just meant I asked for a fork and knife to eat my burger. I prefer my burger naked in lettuce rather than with a bun. One co-worker ordered their veggie burger, and she said that it was also tasty. I'm not a huge burger fan, but when I want one there is just something about a grilled one that is so much better. =) Come hungry!"}
{"text":"This place is tied with the Chuckbox for the best burger in arizona in my book! This is the way a burger was meant to be! Grilled over a wood fire, your choice of cheese and you add the toppings the way YOU want them! The fries are pretty good and the cheese sticks aren't bad either. Don't forget your punch card if you are a regular, I've already gotten one free burger!"}
{"text":"Love this place ,great for family and Adults,,bar is separate from family dining .Ham,chicken & hamburgers cook per order ,so always fresh..you build your own sandwich from the fresh veggie condiment wagon and you also control whatever you want to drink because you fill your own cups I like that part especially with families .I would give 5 stars if tables & area was cleaner,but must not stop people cause evenings always busy"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is still here? I went there as a girl (15+ years ago) with the family on a regular basis. If it's still around, then it MUST be good!"}
{"text":"Go on occasion. Cold beer, your typical bar food. Decent. Wish it was cleaner bar always seems sticky. Makes me wonder ... woman's restroom needs some work. Can't understand why these neighborhood spots always neglect one of the most important issues and that's to have a decent clean restroom , that doesn't smell like a sewer, and soap to wash your hands."}
{"text":"i love the style of the place,the food was ok... not great... I didn't order anything exciting though... just burger and fries.. i think they could have a good business if they expanded hours and worked the bar angle more... they have a good place for it but only open til 11.... the wagon of salad was funny."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite places to go and get a nice burger. Right across the street from Phoenix College and the environment inside is alot of sports memorabilia and other local icons. Best time to go is around 11:30am before the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Great food. If I wanted a mom watching our drinking (I'm 34 and have been here with every age group) I'd grill at my mom's house. Carla is ridiculous. Not sure if this place has had issues in the past, but avoid it if you want to have more than 2 beers."}
{"text":"No long reviews that are 100 paragraphs long.  I will lay this bag of snakes out straight. This is a manly place too eat.  Burgers on one side and beer on the other side.    I have been coming here for a long time and finally giving them a review.  I always get the double with swiss cheese.  I always pass on the salad stuff for my burger.  I just add A1 and that is it for me.  My burger was really yummy.  My co workers burgers were really good to they stated.  I always get cottage cheese as my side because it is yummy.  I am not a fan of French fries or onion rings. This place is great for groups of people too.  If you are a man and want a burger this is your place.  Hulk Smash."}
{"text":"Great casual burger restaurant and bar that caters to the downtown Phoenix crowd, Encanto golf course and neighborhood and students from Phoenix College along with St. Mary's and Brophy Prep High School students. Go in for lunch on a weekend and you'll find numerous golfers cooling off after a round on the links and on Friday nights during high school football season you'll see families getting a bite before Brophy Games at the Phoenix College stadium.  The burgers are big and juicy and with the condiment bar you can add whatever toppings you like. The french fries are thick and seasoned well. My wife loves the ham steak sandwich and the kids like the choice of hamburgers, hot dogs or chicken fingers.  The decor is like an old-fashioned tavern with gas station and other kitschy decorations overlooking wood benches and tables. The TV's usually have ESPN or some sporting events on and you can also sit at the bar or on the patio when the weather permits.  As a whole, the restaurant is very reminiscent of the Chuck Box in Tempe and the Monastery that used to be at 28th and Indian School. A great casual atmosphere to get eats and drinks without the pretension found at some of the new upscale burger joints in town.  Good food for a great price!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fiesta burger... Took awhile to make, longer than I thought it should, but hey, if it's a good burger, worth the wait right?  Well, the burger, while decently flavorful, was a little too \"done\" for my taste, and wasn't all that hot when I got it...  Also, the cheese wasn't melted, so who knows if I just got a patty that had been sitting for awhile...   Overall a decent burger and good fries, although for a small basket of fries it was almost $2.  Burger was also not quite worth the price in my opinion.  Won't be someplace I intentionally go to unless I happen to be closeby and in need of food."}
{"text":"I can see why this has been here for 25 years. Great burger indeed, great atmosphere, the vintage pacman machine up front made me laugh. Interesting the divide between the cozy dining room when you first enter to the lively bar as you explore more. Ping pong table outside, and horseshoes!"}
{"text":"Despite the hokey decor inside, the Original Hamburger Works is one of my stand-by fast food joints in Phoenix. Good burgers on an old fashioned grill, salad bar where you add your toppings yourself, great chicken tenders and grilled chicken sandwiches, baked potatoes, salads, and a cheap full bar with huge pitchers of beer. Nice people, no fuss, tons of big booths. Late hours and low prices. I'm a total fan."}
{"text":"I stopped in last night at the recommendation of a friend. We were just getting some drinks and watching sports. The place wasn't crowded at all; a few folks outside on the patio, maybe two tables in the bar, and few in the dining area.   First we had to clean-off our own booth, second no one acknowledged we were there, third after about 10 mins we went to bar, still had to wait, fourth we walked out.  I've been to these places before (Chuckbox for example), raw wood on the walls, dimly lit, the smell of the flat grill and burgers sizzling, but this place is not one where I would return."}
{"text":"The fish sandwich is delicious! It's a huge fillet grilled basically in front of you. Good beer selection. Great place to watch a game and eat. The salad bar is a perk."}
{"text":"A no frills hole in the wall hamburger joint.  The burger is cooked to order, delicious, and the perfect mix of juicy and slightly greasy so you know you're eating the real deal.  The fixin' bar is an interesting concept which I like since I can pile on as many goodies as I like.  The bar gets a little messy at times, but eh, who cares.  The burgers are not the cheapest, but then again if you wanted cheap you'd go to a dollar menu, no?  Its worth the line, and fighting some of the students from across the street (Phoenix College) for a bite at Hamburger Works!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite hamburger place.   Awesome flame grilled hamburgers and good fries every time.  The fried zucchini and mushrooms are delicious. Condiment bar makes customizing easy.   Love the family atmosphere and low prices.   It's worth the drive across town."}
{"text":"I got the border burger, it was great. Any option you might want they have. Prices are fair, customer service was good.... I really like the atmosphere here. It looks like it was built long ago but well kept and clean. I'll be back"}
{"text":"In the mood for a burger last night, but not willing to settle for Yak-in-the-Box, Hubby suggested this place, to which he had been once before with a co-worker. It's a casual, dive-y sort of place, which I like. There were a lot of different types of people there- firemen, loners, business men and women... It's got a huge interior, some cool copper topped tables, and some seizure inducing lights (far too blinky for an exhausted grumpy me).   You order your food at a small window once you have mooed your way through an amusement park-like railing system (albeit a short one) and you specify a burger (or from a short list of other menu items), and your options are bun type and cheese type. At no point did I get asked to what charness I want my ground cow. Hence, I ate puck on a bun. Next time, I'll ask for medium. A third pound burger was plenty (they have half pounders, too), and the bacon comes in circles (which is cool- bacon in every bite is never a bad thing!).  We also had the 1/2 mushrooms 1/2 zucchini side, which was ok. We've had better and worse of both. The topping bar was ok- your usual suspects together with the requisite peppers to make your experience  \"southwestern.\""}
{"text":"By far the best burger I have had in Phoenix.  The menu is simple and to the point. If you want a good burger in Phoenix this is the place to go. The meat is just so much better than Lenny's, Lucky Boy or any other place in town."}
{"text":"The portioning is great but the food is very bland. I got the chili cheese fries and those had no flavor (711 chilli has more flavor). I also got a basic cheeseburger which was also just ok. The wings were really good though! I would go back just for the wings. Other than that, nothing special here."}
{"text":"Thee best!! Soooo good bartenders and workers are so great! Awesome atmosphere! Def.a+++"}
{"text":"This is a great back-yard-type-char-grilled burger. Expect that and you'll be fine.   I've seen some comments about the burger being dry. Yup. I've never asked for rare or medium. I'm not sure they could do it right. If I were paying $10 dollars for the burger then I'd expect them to do it right.  It is not a gourmet burger place nor do they claim to be.   Onion rings over fries."}
{"text":"The burgers are good. Better than most, but the area where they keep the condiments and vegetables for your burgers leave a lot to be desired.  Vegetables aren't very fresh and the handles used on the tongs are often found in the condiments and veggies :( It's a good place to stop at if you're passing by but there are definitely better burger places in the valley if u want a great burger. Solid burgers not so fresh everything else."}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered the Big Ones and Fries. Love the opportunity to choose a whole wheat, onion, or white bun. The walk-up fixin bar has every condiment you need for a burger or sandwich. Service was friendly and very clean atmosphere. I will be back to try their chicken sandwiches and shakes."}
{"text":"This certainly would rank up there within the top five great burgers that I've ever had.  Almost no grease from the meat, the condiment bar with a nice selection of toppings and the french fries cooked just right. All and all it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I went here to use a buy one get one free coupon 2nite, good upto $8. I ordered 2 10-pice wings for about $8.xx per order. I figured I'd order a small onion rings too since I was getting a good deal on the BOGO wings. Well boy was in for a surprise. When I got there, the cashier said the BOGO applies to the onion rings. I said fine, take that off the order and then I can apply it to the wings. She STILL said no since the coupon said upto $8 and the wings were a bit over $8. Now any moron knows that with this kind of coupon, you'd just get the credit of $8. In fact I used a very similar Q-pon just the previous nite at another restaurant and they had no issues with me using in. Even worse, I have used this EXACT qpon at this EXACT same establishment many times over the years! I ended just canceling the order and walking out in disgust. I think management needs to train their cashiers on how these Q-pons work. The cashier 2nite was clearly clueless. I worked a 12 hour day and came in here very hungry not expecting this at all. Instead I left hungry and angry. Disgusted with this experience 2nite. Dont eat here, they will screw you!!"}
{"text":"The burgers at The Works are friggin' amazing, there is not much more to say about it.  The menu is just a budget sign (where Cheddar is spelled \"Chedder\", yipes...) with a variety of burgers and sides that are sure to please.  The fixins bar is also outstanding, of course I am the kind of slob who tries to put 12 slices of tomato on his burger, so take that for what it's worth.  In addition, they have Super Mario Brothers of 8-bit Nintendo fame which you can play for a quarter while you wait for your burger.  I once made it to Level 8 before my burger was ready which says a lot more about my hours wasted playing Nintendo than their service, as the burgers always come up pretty quick.  Great place, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Back again this time for the burger with green chile.  Excellent and very tasty.  My roommate had the fish sandwich; extremely good portion.  Love the burger bar.  New favorite green chile burger."}
{"text":"MEAT!  They make hamburgers, very well too.  Not much else.  There are fries, of course and the veggie burger I guess if you want that (which I am sure is thrown on the same grill so it gets a nice coating of beef fat).  They make burgers, pretty dang good burgers.  Decently quick and to order.  Plus a condiment bar (that seems to be missing BBQ sauce, for shame).  If you want something that isn't a burger you shouldn't be going to a place called \"Burger Works\" to begin with.  If you want a good burger, it's a good choice."}
{"text":"As a person that hails Fuddruckers as one of the best burger joints, I was amazed and would say this place will take Fudd's place.   This place is half sports bar and half vintage dinning experience. With sport memorabilia around the bar and old Route 66-type decor in the main dining area.   The burgers are taste in a backyard sense. Ever cooked burgers in a open flamed grill before? This is what you're getting and much more. I haven't eating a good large burger with this taste elsewhere and I would gladly invite my friends and family to at least try this out. There isn't much to say but I really enjoyed this place and there is no excuse not to try it out."}
{"text":"A busy Friday night with a Brophy HS football game at PHX college across the street did not slow down the excellent service all night. The burgers, wings, and onion rings were all very tasty. The wings had a good bit of heat (ordered med) and tasty without being stupid. Ice cold pitchers of beer on a 114 degree late afternoon speaks to the fast service. A classic joint where the food is the issue and not a cookie cutter chain.  A great patio with ping pong and plenty of misters."}
{"text":"This place is a straight up burger shop. No thrills, no gimmicks. If you love cheeseburgers, you need to come here. They make everything to order, so you can have just about any combination and you can add whatever condiments you want; as they have a full sized salad bar full of condiments.  Walking in, the place screams cheeseburger... not a place for vegans."}
{"text":"Well it has been about three weeks since I made the choice to visit this shrine to all that is burger, and I wanted to share my experience. I was online looking through reviews for other burger places when I found this place. I noticed that the reviews seemed pretty good so I decided to check it out.   So on a Friday afternoon my buddy and I walked in to this old school looking building searching for what I was hoping was going to be one tasty burger ( think Samuel L. Jackson in pulp fiction) and I was right! The burgers are a nice size given some of the prices (7 bucks for a burger)?    My tasty burger featured American cheese and a well done patty that looked like someone had made it at their house. Large disk shaped patty grilled the way I like it and ready for the several toppings I would choose to add from their topping bar. That 's right they have a section set up where you decide what you want to add to your sandwich. Cool, huh? OK so now that the good stuff has been said let 's get to the bad.   First as the saying goes all that glitters is not gold was talking about this place. From the old looking tables that featured chairs that looked like they where taken from the set of Roseann, to the small and expensive order of fries I received there where some areas that needed improvement asap. The lady taking our order was not the most friendly person you will ever meet and the bar section was to close to the dinning room section so you get the full effect of being a loud drinker without having to pay 4-5 bucks for a beer.   Also some of the decorations looked kind of dusty like they where kept outside during the last dust storm. So if you want good burgers then this is a good place for that. But if you want a cool hangout spot you may want to pop in a DVD of cheers and grab that burger to go."}
{"text":"Good prices, awesome burgers that are fresh, and cooked on a wood fired grill. Condiments and such are do-it-yourself. Fries are home-made and good. Outside has smoking area. Could use some better beers on tap, and wifi would attract more college students. Still worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"Damn Good Burger! (I appreciate the load your own toppings and the variety of burger sizes and cheese options)  Super onion rings! (SUPER ONION RINGS!)  Limited but fresh salad bar. (Iceberg, onion, bell pepper, cucumber, broccoli, shrooms, shredded cheese, bacon bits, hard boiled egg, croutons. Can grab tomato and hot peppers from the burger topping side.)  Great prices! (My 1/3lb really good burger with no cheese was $5.29. Choice of white, wheat, onion bun.)  Crappy draft/draught selection - which is the hold back from the 5th star. (I prefer something a bit more...ummm, well, more beer like than Michelob's Amber Bock.)  I will be back!  Damn, that was a good burger!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will definitely come back. Friendly staff, good environment and good food. You order your hamburger and add toppings by yourself. I recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is down the street from where I work so it is a favorite stop for my co-workers and I.  This place is on par with Fuddruckers.  Burgers are good and cooked to order.  The place has a great feel to it.  Don't order the jalapeño poppers, complete joke.  This place is listed on http://www.restaurant.com/ so don't forget to get yourself a killer discount!  All and all the place is a great burger at a decent price.  I would certainly recommend."}
{"text":"my 2nd time here.  Got great service, and great food same as first time.  My colleague was along.  I ordered a cheeseburger, no side, she had fish & chips.  All excellent.  Self-serve condiment bar to get whatever you like.  Busy place, and now you know why.  we would return."}
{"text":"This burger place was really good. I had the number #1 combo(no drink included) for $5.99 which is a pretty reasonable price. Burger was pretty good size,  i dont think theres a need for double or bigger than the Big One. I added bacon and I appreciate its in round shape so it covers more bites than strip bacon. Fries were good as well. Onion rings could be skipped nothing special. We also ordered a side of chili i would skip it too.   If you know Anthony Bourdains top 3 burger joint in the word named Sams in San Fran then you could compare the flavors and feel. This reminded me of that place. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! My friends and I have been here a couple times and everything has been good! The hamburgers are grilled and have really good flavor. I haven't tried anything else like the chicken or fish but I plan on working my way around the menu, lol!"}
{"text":"Fun throw back to the western burger shacks of yesteryear. I read many poor reviews for service but ours was friendly and prompt. Possibly the poor service is San issue specifically in the bar?  The burger was large and tasty. The chicken breast sandwich was very large, juicy and flavorful. I liked the veggie cart to put my own toppings on it. It was clean and everything looked fresh.  Tons of options for non alcoholic fountain drinks including 3 different iced teas which always makes me happy. My only disappointment was I ordered the chicken and salad special but they must not have heard me because I received fries instead of salad. I would've swapped it out but the line was long at that point. Promising side is I now know to order no sides next time as the chicken was more than enough."}
{"text":"If you are looking for quality this is not the place for you.  Hamburger is big but doesn't have much taste, it was also a bit cold."}
{"text":"Been several times.  Always good. One time I went for lunch and the grill was broken. We had to wait for them to repair it and that took about 30 minutes before the burgers started coming out. It was still worth the wait."}
{"text":"I ordered the fiesta burger and was surprised at how dry it was even with the guac on it. The patty its self was just dry and not seasoned very well. My friend had the chesse burger with bacon and could not finish even a 1/4 of it due to the dryness. I was also a little concerned at the lack of cleaniness about the sides bar. I witness the guy replenishing the bar but putting the old ketchup on top of the new ketchup. The problem with this is that the old ketchup had lettuce and pepper pieces in it.  However the onion rings were great as well as the fried Zucchini. Prehaps my friend and I visted them on an off night."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good burger on Saturday and found the OBW on Yelp and decided to give it a shot although it was a little bit of a drive since I live in Buckeye and this is in downtown Phoenix little bit of  a drive just for a Burger however after finishing The Big One completely satisfied and will return"}
{"text":"Just went her for the first time Sunday. I added a salad bar plate to go with my meal and it was $4.01. That's crazy. The salad bar wasn't stocked and the lettuce was brownish. Even if I wanted more salad or to get my $4 dollars worth they only give you one small plate.  Definitely not worth it. The kids chicken fingers were all breading and really dry and my burger wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's definitely a hidden gem and the food is great. Oddly enough their wings and fried zucchini are my favorite and you can also get a good burger  It does tend to get a little warm inside when they are busy. The decor is also really cool! Classic soda machines and old signage is fun to look at while your waiting for your food. The price is affordable and the quality is great."}
{"text":"A great local spot for burgers, fries, onion rings and other sandwiches. You can also pile on your own toppings yourself and they have a salad bar (if you're into that). My favorite is the teriyaki chicken sandwich that comes with a slice of pineapple for about $6. I get it on wheat with no cheese and load it up with onions and jalapeños myself (no extra charge). A good local healthy option.   The gigantic burgers with multiple patties and cheese are also amazing in moderation. Everything is made to order. Staff are friendly. Cool place with good value."}
{"text":"Chili was awesome... Good toppings bar but nothing out of the ordinary. Burger was moist & well cooked but without seasoning. Great chocolate shakes!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!! $5 for a pitcher of beer? heck yeah!!!"}
{"text":"Good char grilled burger and onion rings we're better than expected.   $4 Bloody Mary's on Sat & Sun and they weren't bad.  Liked the condiment bar.  Good casual Burger joint that serves cocktails."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. Fried potatoes are a standout and wings have just enough fire to make them interesting. Go here a few times and it will be a place where everyone knows your name."}
{"text":"My wife and I checked OHW out because of a Restaurants.com special (got the $10 off $20 food coupon for $1.50!)  It's a bit far for us to go, but we've been there twice already.    The food reminds me of a place in CA that had equally great mesquite grilled burgers.  The salad bar is good too.  I just wish they had real bacon bits rather than the fake stuff.  All of the other salad ingredients are fresh and delicious, if somewhat standard.  The single serving plate is reasonably priced and generous in proportion.  Too large, really, because I had to take my burger to go after eating the salad!  It made a great dinner.    My wife enjoys the onion rings very much. I sneaked a bite of hers and can attest to their quality.  She is not as jazzed about this place as I am, but does like the food.  Weekdays this place can be quite busy due to it's proximity to business.  However, we did not have to wait in line to order, found an open booth, and our food was ready in no time.  It's a burger place and has it's own special character (meaning old building and decor.)  If you are looking for good burgers in Phoenix, this is the best I've found so far."}
{"text":"Well after one year in Arizona, I can finally say that I have given up hope on finding the best burger in Phoenix. out here burger joints are almost all the same in every way. thun patties & lots of creative yet unoriginal condiments and combinations.  R.F. O'Sullivans will remain at the top of the list as Boston is the king of Burgers. Burgers to me should be tasteful, these patties are all well done and thun as hell. I ordered the super big great one weighing in at one pound but it just takes like burnt meat loaded withbsauce. Where are them thicc patties at?! not a bad place for a sit down but barely a a step above in n out."}
{"text":"Great burgers at great prices! It's hard to find good food that doesn't break the bank, but this is the real deal. I didn't give it a full 5 stars because I had to wait about 20 minutes for my burger--but it was worth the wait! I had the small one with onion rings and a chocolate shake and ate every last bit. I would highly recommend this burger joint because of the yummy food and fun atmosphere. I am already planning on returning and bringing more friends!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Best wings in town. Period. I stand by these wings with my life. Seriously.   This one time I walked into burger works one evening with some friends. A guy from Mesa was with his wife at the bar and asked us as a group what to get on the menu.   We suggested they split a burger, fries and an order of wings. This guy said \"wings? Why get the wings here if this is a burger place?\" I replied to this man \"honestly bro, this place has the best wings ever.\" To which the man replied \"really the best wings? If these wings ain't the best I've had, can I stab you?\" I said to the man \"you can try bro, you can try.\"   About 20 minutes later as my buddies and I were chomping down on some wings and washing it back with some beer. The guy from Mesa who threatened to stab me came out and shook my hand. I really did see the look on a grown man's face that resembled a child going to Disneyland for the first time. \"Bro! Thank you! Thank you! Those really are the best wings ever! I'm coming back to this place! Believe that! Now I don't have to stab you and go to prison! Thanks again bro, have a good night!\"   Burger works wings are powerful. So powerful they are a solution to make violent people happy."}
{"text":"If you were to open up the suggestion box this place has in its bar area, you would probably find 7 or so aging receipts for Fiesta Burgers that have one thing requested on them: \"BBQ Sauce Please.\" They are all from me from my (thankfully) not very frequent visits here.  This place is like a local Fuddrucker's sans the awesome Fuddrucker's condiment bar and quality burgers. Instead there is a a bare bones selection of toppings with only ketchup, mustard, and some A-1 to sauce your bad-memorial-day-BBQ-esque burger. Taking a bite of burger here, you would swear your idiot cousin Ricky who thinks he knows everything about grilling, but could screw up boiling a hot dog, is manning the grill.   The food here would give this place only 2 stars, but it has its benefits. Its a cheap place to get something to eat when you want to watch some sporting event during lunch. I came for the Euro 2008 match between Russia and Sweeden and almost every T.V. there had it on. They have a decent-sized screen in the main room and plenty of small T.V.s in their bar area where you can also treat yourself to a sub-par selection of drinks during lunch time. (Picture the alcohol version of thier ketchup, mustard, and A1 sauce selection).   Its dark, wooden interior also helps you hide from a blistering hot day like today's 110 degree heat. Along with its wooden interior is plenty of camp to cover the walls and some cabinet style old school arcade machines. The fact that it has its Ms. Pac Man cabinet running is the only advantage I can see this place really having over Two Hippies or any other cheap burger joint."}
{"text":"So far this is the best hamburger in Phoenix that i have found.  I am a big fan of how they cook them.  they are actually cooked over a wood grill!!!  this is not your typical McDonalds grill... beacuse of this the burgers have a unique flavor...  once you get your burger you walk to the hamburger bar where you put on it what you like... much like fudruckers, but much more original!  I am also a fan of their fries... the place is pretty easy to get in and out of...   do yourself a favor and try this place!"}
{"text":"Cool looking place prices are good..very nice place will definalty have to go back again."}
{"text":"Start off your trip here just like the cows did, corralled in to a long orderly line, but you will be met by some one who takes your order not the slaughter house.  If you are not a meat eater your options are limited, and on my visit they were out of veggie burgers. Luckily they have a cod sandwich (4.79). If you want a side think cut fries are a steep $1.75 for a small tray or they have other options like fried zucinni that is upwards of $3  The condiment section is great with jalapeños peppers sauces galore onions lettuce and tomato.  for a drink they have a new coke flavor wave which is always fun, and there is a bar that is connected with free popcorn which is a big plus for me. (that is why its 4 stars)  My fish sandwich it self tasted of char and the included tar tar sauce, the bun was soft and fresh. Despite saying its was some large fraction of a pound of fish it seemed a bit thin and small.  Overall if you are a vegetarian, pescaterian you can make by here but it should not be your first choice."}
{"text":"Good service and great burgers. Their onion rings are the best in town and vanilla shakes are yummy. We also the cool decorations."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Love their huge selection of drink options and the choose your own condiment station. It's a little dark hideaway that serves up great food. I've been back a couple times a week since I initially found this place via Yelp. You gotta try these burgers!"}
{"text":"This place hasn't changed much in the last 15yrs or so and that's what I love! Still looks exactly the same!!! It's not the fanciest or stylish or even cleanest burger spot for sure but that's the best part!!! The salad bar for your burger choice takes it to the top!!!! Plenty of options and even a bar if that's the type of burger eating vibe you want!!! Thx for staying true and the same!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a comfy place for a juicy burger and amazing fries...Here it is!  So lucky to have come across this place. The atmosphere is just perfect, tv's with sports on all the time, full far, and salad bar for you to customize your burger to your liking.   I usually get the #4 which is the small one with some fries. Don't be fooled by the name \"small one\" their burgers are a pretty good size and when you add all your toppings from the salad bar, it gets even BIGGER! I have seen the bigger burgers, and boy are those huge! You are able to choose the kind of cheese and bun that you want, and that's always good.   Heard the jalapeno poppers are good and their mushroom topping is too!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! This spot is a must for awesome burgers.   The atmosphere is pretty no frills, you order at a walk up window and can observe your burger being cooked on a massive grill through the large windows into the kitchen. The burgers come plain and there is a pretty basic variety of toppings at a self serve topping bar.   The burger was so good! Just really tasty and good quality. And super cheesy! I can't say enough that it's just a really great burger.   The mozzarella sticks were nothing out of this world but still really good. The jalapeño poppers though, omg. So good! They're stuffed with melty cheese and come with a super yummy south western style ranch.   If you've ever been to the chuck box this place might feel really familiar, apparently one of the owners also owns that spot. 110% a great spot for fantastic burgers, I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"So excited to find this great burger place in our neighborhood! This restaurant is decorated super kitschy and quaint, and feels like you're back in time the moment you walk in.  The burgers come bare, and cheese is an add on. What I really loved was the fixin's bar, where you can dress up your burger with lettuce, onion, pickles, tomatoes, condiments - whatever you want.  The chicken tenders looked reeeally good, but I just got a small burger with fries. Hubby got the double big burger and shared my fries (saving me from myself since 2013...HA.)   Service was super nice. You can see the real chicken breasts and burger patties being made on the grill and the food definitely looked, felt, and tasted high quality."}
{"text":"YUM!  Char broiled burger on an onion bun with sautéed mushrooms, onions and provolone. Burgers the way they used to be. If you're in the mood for a burger, this is your place. By the way onion rings rock!"}
{"text":"Giant hamburgers and very tasty.  Very difficult to understand the person calling out your name to pick up your order so my food sat on The counter for a bit."}
{"text":"Good, quality food with a friendly staff. Great places for families and groups. Try the fried zucchini...excellent!  Biggest ding: dirty restrooms."}
{"text":"Love it!    Great atmosphere, such a neat place to be.  Then the burger and fries are awesome.  The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because I want to go back and tell them how I wanted my burger cooked, I'm not a fan of \"well\" which predictably is apparently their default.  I heard the onion rings are great also so I look forward to trying them also.    It appears to get really busy so if you can get there a little ahead of the rush."}
{"text":"This place is everything your Dad's weekend BBQ burger joint dreamt of being! The nostalgic flare of the late 80's tavern decor brings me back to the feeling of walking into the old mans favorite watering hole that never fails on delivery delicious eats for the Fam.  I loved the top yourself selection of onions pickles tomatoes etc. after a pick of meats and grilled treats!  If you live in the area, or just passing through like myself, I would suggest this spot to my best of friends!! Thanks OG Burger joint"}
{"text":"Family and I really enjoyed this place, luckily we came by during off peak hours. I have driven by at times and the parking lot was full. But it has a great environment, burgers were very good, fries and onion rings were great. Overall we had a great time and we will come by again."}
{"text":"If I had a place to hang out in my backyard and had someone serve burgers, it'd kinda be like this place.  Prices are great, atmosphere is fun, owner is sweet and thoughtful (big screen that faces the patio, mister system, ceiling fans outside, stuff for the kids, etc.)  It's an interesting mix of people (all nice).  Burgers are good, teriyaki chicken is a bit too salty, their iced-tea machine is way cool, has all the DIY condiments you need for everyone's basic burger wishes.  Helpful hint: Chico's Tacos (another great establishment) has coupons for Original Hamburger Works on a board in their shop."}
{"text":"So much for my previous review....expounding on the virtues of flame-broiled meat and that glorious smell it produces. The place burned down last night."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in Central Phoenix, in need of a meal, this is a great option.  I frequent this place, because it's close to work and popular with my co-workers.  I've been coming here since the 80's, so you know it has a huge following of long-term customers.  It's pretty much the same now as it was back in the day.  You get in a line, and place your order.  Get at least a 1/3 lb burger; any smaller and I think they come out a little tough.  Their 'Classic' burger is amazing- patty, cheese, mushrooms, bacon.  HEAVEN!  You can mix your fried sides, or just get fries.  They have great onion rings, zucchini, fries, and mushrooms.  Serve your own drink.  They call you name to pick up your food, and you head over with your big pizza-pan type tray and add your fixins from a generously stocked condiments bar.  In addition, they have a bar with basic drinks and sports playing on TV's, if that's your thing.  It's a great place to meet up with friends. Friendly and casual atmosphere.  Lots of locals, college students, hospital employees, police officers and firefighters here.  Would I drive 10 miles to this location, just to get a burger?  Likely not, but it's a GREAT option if you are down here in the 'hood, going to the airport, a museum, a play, the courthouses, or another place in Central Phoenix.  A NOTE- they have great grilled chicken, and salad is an option if you are on-the-wagon in terms of burgers and fries."}
{"text":"If you love grilling your burgers but don't feel like grilling I strongly recommend Hamburger Works. Been coming here since I was just a kid. Also the grilled buffalo chicken sandwich add pepper jack cheese is ridiculously good, you will thank me later."}
{"text":"So divey & wonderful.  The establishment may or may not be older than I am, but they serve a cold beer and a good burger, two of my favorite things. Self serve condiments and salad bar, so prepare to get up and fix your burger."}
{"text":"I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.  Who needs a sports bar when you can go to the Original Hamburger Works. The restaurant might not look like much from the outside but like the old adage goes \"You can't judge a book by its cover\" the same can be said about The Original Hamburger Works.   The Original Hamburger Works has a sports bar vibe and inviting atmosphere, with lots of TV's that show sports all over the restaurant, and the restaurant  is spacious, well kept, and clean.  The burgers are big, fresh, and made to order. You select what size burger you want, type of cheese, and type of bun, and then the fun begins.  The Original Hamburger Works offers a condiment wagon filled with various burger fixens.  The condiments bar is a nice addition because your simply given your flame grilled burger and bun and the rest is up to you.  So be prepared to pile on the \"fixins\" at no extra charge.  Great food, reasonable prices, and amazing customer service.  What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"The burgers here are pretty good, but the PA system they use after you corral around the line from placing an order, then paying for it is horrible, as well as the rush hour lunch crowd lines to pick your meal. talk about confusing when there are multiple orders in the pick up window, with another crowd of hungry people pushing orders around just to find their own."}
{"text":"Although I had no plans to eat here, the opportunity presented itself and my husband was getting hungry so I had only minutes before there was a possibility he would launch into d-bag mode.  OHW reminds me of Bun Huggers in Flagstaff both in decor and concept, where you wait in line to order off the overhead menu, burgers are cooked to order, and you help yourself to the topping bar.  Only here, the green chiles are fresh.  + 100 stars for that!  Burger and rings were great, but the fries were nothing special.  Several sized burgers are offered (in addition to chicken and fish) which is great for me because the one thing I can't eat in vast quantities is ground beef, so the small is the perfect size.  The topping bar was reasonably clean, they were busy, but the produce looked fresh.  They even have the coke dispenser with the computer interface, as well as the standard fountain.  While in theory it should shorten the drink lines, not so much when there's a child in front of you or a 40+-year old who needs instruction on how to work it.  Screw you dude behind me waiting impatiently while I read the instructions!"}
{"text":"I love this burger joint. Lots of options and quality meat offer great lunch options if you work in the area. I highly recommend this restaurant if you enjoy a tasty burger. It's not easy to find a good one in Arizona."}
{"text":"Burger was good, got onion rings and fried zucchini and they were both over cooked overall experience was just okay"}
{"text":"As if trapped in a bad cowboy movie, I bellied up to the bar at The Original Hamburger Works and couldn't help but think, what have I gotten myself into?  Country music was playing on the jukebox, and it was a little unnerving to overhear a conversation between other patrons about a bar fight.  Then the buxom bartender said \"hi\" and something in her voice was genuine and welcoming and her smile could have brightened a room. Pouring a pitcher of beer from the tap, then setting an ice-cold glass in front of me, she offered up a menu.  While the 30-year-old eatery in Phoenix is showing its age, the attitude is laid back and super friendly.  The Original Hamburger Works has two dining rooms, the bar and a more family-friendly space. The taste is decidedly kitschy, with walls covered in vintage signs, sporting memorabilia and chotchkies galore. The atmosphere is fun. Large tables can accommodate big groups. Orders are placed and paid for at the counter. In the bar, orders are taken by the bartender.  Like a campfire, there is something mouthwatering about the strong smell of mesquite wood smoke emanating from the kitchen. You can tell from watching the cooks manhandle slabs of meat over an open flame that the burgers here are treated right.  The centerpiece of the dining room is a wagon filled with fresh-sliced tomatoes, lettuce, onions and pickles and condiments and salad dressings. You are in control of your burger destiny with as many ladles of ranch dressing as you'd like. I'd recommend not going too heavy on the condiments and toppings; the burgers here can stand on their own.  Biting into the Big One ($4.09) gives new meaning to the whimsical saying. A deep amber charbroiled crust surrounds the 1/3 pound of fresh ground beef, inside it's perfectly medium, as ordered. The meat is toothsome, well seasoned and bursting with a wonderful beefy caramelized flavor.  Potatoes, aka fries ($1.79), were disappointingly pale and seemingly unsalted. I'd opt for the Onion Rings ($2.69), fried golden brown and addictive with dunks into ranch dressing.  If you don't eat red meat you're in luck, they make a juicy Chicken Sandwich ($5.09). Cooked over the same mesquite coals, this sandwich has a surprising amount of satisfying heft. The Italian version gets a treatment of flavor, adding Italian dressing before getting cooked to a savory finish.  Fair warning: When eating Buffalo Wings (nine pieces for $5.95) don't wear a nice shirt. These are so sloppy that you may need a stack of wet-naps to get through the plate, but exactly how they should be.  The Original Hamburger Works might be a little bit country, but the burgers are a whole lot of rock 'n roll."}
{"text":"A retirement burger!?  Including the restaurant and a company car...for only $1,000,069!?  I'm still getting a laugh from that sign!  This place has character!  I went on a spur-of-the-moment lunch trip to the Original Hamburger Works.  Working for a place with offices in Downtown Phoenix and in Glendale, the location was actually quite convenient with plenty of parking available.  While there was a long line when we walked in, it went VERY fast and I had to even make some quick decisions when I made it to the counter.  The price is right whether you want a combo meal, a one-pound burger for under $10, or more \"normal\" sized burgers or chicken sandwiches.    The food itself was very good!  I had a Big One (1/3 lb) and fries combo meal.  My four friends had either burgers or chicken sandwiches with a variety of sides (salad, fried pickles, fried mushrooms, or fries).  Everyone seemed quite happy with their choices.  And I learned quickly that they had all been to the Original Hamburger Works on several prior occasions.  Now, having tried it myself, I plan on coming back, too.  Thanks, Original Hamburger Works, for a great first experience!"}
{"text":"Good burgers....no need for cheese or bacon the fries or ok...i couldn't tell you about anything else...all i get is the burgers"}
{"text":"After moving here from the midwest I found it hard to find a decent burger.  (I'm still searching for decent BBQ.)  Anyway, my man and I finally tried The Original Hamburger Works.  You like big, juicy burgers?  A choice of white, wheat, or onion buns?  Would you like a \"salad wagon\" with all the condiments you can pile on?!  Of course you would!  And if you don't then just go eat at In & Out burger where you don't get any choices.  Blech!  There's lots of big, comfortable booth seating, the prices are reasonable, and portions are large.  They'd get 5 stars if their staff were a little more professional and courteous."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town and the fish and chips to die for yummy!!  I love that.  Try it can't go wrong.."}
{"text":"Nice little spot to grab a burger or spicy chicken sandwich.  Get there early for lunch though because the lines can get long."}
{"text":"Food as always is good.  The Service on the other hand is very unaccomdating.  The girl at the register let us know when we asked if there was a manager available that they were all on vacation.  So I am guessing that customer service is the last thing this place realy cares about.  Because of the rudness."}
{"text":"The Original Hamburger Works is an authentic, rustic Arizona treasure. I am going to address some of the negative reviews I read here within my review.  Firstly, if you're expecting fine dining and to be waited on hand-and-foot, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!. This is a classic, cowboy-style establishment. That means, apart from cooking the food, YOU do everything yourself, the way YOU like it. No one will get in your way or tell you that you're doing it wrong or that you don't fit in. This is not a fad, nor is it a corporate-owned, soulless entity that employs big breasted women and other shallow gimmicks to trick you into eating here.  The Original Hamburger Works has been in business since 1977 and has only stayed in business this long, in the same location, because it generates enough income on a sustainable and regular basis to justify its very existence since it opened more than 38 years ago! NOT because it has some rich financial or corporate investors. This is the real deal that proves it has passed the test of time that kills the vast majority of independent restaurants within the first few years.  I'm a very fussy eater, but I've never tasted anything here I didn't like. I have no idea how the fried foods (french fries, onion rings, breaded mushrooms, etc...) don't come out greasy. I have no idea how the hamburgers melt in your mouth, even plain, with nothing on them!  The ordering process is, again, cowboy-style. A style you likely won't find any place else. You walk up to the counter, located below the large menu mounted on the wall, and place your order with the cooks. They give you a printed copy of your order and then you walk to the cashier, just around the corner to the left. She looks at the printed order, rings it up and you pay her. She asks for your name and gives you cups for any sodas ordered.  Next, fill your sodas/tea/water however you like. After that, find a table and seat yourself. There are free peanuts (in the shell) and popcorn by the bar - help yourself.   Your name will be called out when your order is ready. This typically takes less than 15 minutes (in my experience). Your food is waiting for you by the cashier, on disposable plates, on a large silver platter. Bring the platter to your table, and when you're ready (and if you ordered a burger) take your burger to the burger-bar and top it with whatever you like, as much as you like, just the way you, and ONLY you, know how you like it.  Go back to your table, enjoy your meal and, when done, throw everything away except for plastic baskets and the silver platter. Set those above the garbage can.  This place is very down-to-earth. The prices are great and the food is terrific. The staff are busy working, so you often won't have much (or any) conversation with them apart from the ordering and paying process. If previous customers leave without cleaning up after themselves, they're the ignorant, inconsiderate, self-entitled jerks to blame, NOT the staff. However, the staff *WILL* clean the tables if they notice or you ask (whichever comes first). We've all been to fast food restaurants where slob, inconsiderate cretins pretending to be human beings, leave their mess for the others to clean up. Some 'people' are just inconsiderate pigs and shouldn't eat out at fast food restaurants where YOU ARE EXPECTED TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF! (Did I put enough emphasis on consideration?)  Half of the building is the restaurant and the other half a bar. Sit where you are most comfortable. Its interesting to note that the booths by the bar have salt and pepper shakers, but other booths in the restaurant do not. There are salt and pepper shakers at the burger bar. Once again, help yourself. Put it back where you found it when you're done.  When you understand the social contract involved with eating here, you'll realize how much you enjoy it is directly related to how much you WANT to enjoy it. The employees are not there to entertain you.   You should certainly feel safe while dining here as you'll often see Phoenix police officers dining here regularly.  I honestly believe if you choose to dine here with the right attitude and expectations, you'll enjoy it as much (or more) than my family does. We've never had a bad experience with the staff or the food in the 4-5 years we've been dining here - and if we did, we understand mistakes sometimes happen and would address those issues accordingly. These are human beings working here, not robots. Treat others as you would like others to treat you. I admit, we do not eat here often enough! It seems like every time we finish a meal here, I ask my wife why its been so long since we were last here. I only wish I had known about it 30 years ago!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I sit in the bar and as one other reviewer noted, there is always someone interesting there to start up a conversation. The burgers are top dawg, the condiment bar allows me to fulfill my jalepeno quota, the wings are perfection, and the drinks are reasonable.   When the weather is nice, grab a table outside. The service is a smidge slower, but the courtyard more than makes up for it. If the weather is warm settle in and enjoy whatever game they have playing (if you aren't seeing your team, just ask and they will happily turn at least one set for you)."}
{"text":"Overall the place is cool. I prefer a thick meaty burger, but this was a little thin. The cheese was a half slice of American and should have been bigger. The burger was a little over done compared to my request and the staff could have been a little nicer.   With all the seemingly negative comments, it could very easily be one of the best flavored burgers I have had. The smoke taste was in every bite, the meat was quality and tasted fresh, the self serve condiment bar was a plus, the red cream soda was a nice surprise. The frys were frys, a little crispy and perfect.   I will be back and I will get the 1/2lb with extra cheese. I am sure I will be re-rating to a 5 if the staff steps it up too."}
{"text":"PLUS: Big burgers, cooked when ordered. Variety of sides (fried mushrooms, zucchini, etc.) No attitude.  MINUS: $4.95 for a shake? Really? The fixin's on the salad bar can look a little haggard at times."}
{"text":"Good food and drink. But customer service is awful. Just be be careful who's on staff they might bite. Do not get the Bloody Mary. Buy the garlic fries and the burgers are great."}
{"text":"It's sort of an undesirable location, but the restaurant itself is a neat concept.  Made to order, hole-in-the-wall vibe, no need for a server, and all the toppings you need atop a wagon in the middle of the place. The prices are decent and the hamburger...works (like that play on words?) I enjoyed it and would recommend eating here over chains such as Red Robin and Chili's (on most nights)."}
{"text":"Arizona Burger Tour: Original Hamburger Works  Judging Criteria:  First appearance: Meat, cheese and toasted bun. Slightly squished, but not crushed. Nothing special, but alluring in a simple and basic way. I will say, the smell was intoxicating (I know, I know... You can smell with your eyes.)  Flavor:  The meat was well seasoned and flavorful if not a little on the charred side. The cheese was lost in translation and might as well of not been there. Each bite was consistent in the quality. The only other real issue is the meat is cooked well done, so it looses some of its beefy flavor.   Meat to bun ratio:  Nearly perfect. The patty fits to almost every edge of the bun. It was all finished at the same time. Also, the thickness of the burger complimented the toasted bun.   Included extras (veggies / condiments): Cheese. Everything else is added from the toppings bar. I won't review the burger with toppings. However, I added tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, white onion and ketchup.    Price: $5.39  Grade: B = Really good. The burger has good flavor but might have a flaw or two.   Follow the tour on Instagram at @RequiemofChaos."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. Don't expect anything fancy, but good tasting and good quality food.  You can grab a beer and watch the game too!!"}
{"text":"I was debating 2 or 3 stars for a while and settled on 2.  As Yelp puts it \"2 stars, \"Meh. I've experienced better\".  I tried this place because of restaurant.com and I must say that the voucher was a great deal, that being said, if I hadn't had such a deal then I would have been even less impressed.    There are a few \"old-fashioned Hamburger\" type places in the valley and this one really isn't any different.  The menu feels a little high priced for what you're actually getting, lots of grease.    Without being too harsh as it really isn't that bad.  I wouldn't not recommend this place as there was nothing that would keep me from going back.  I've had the hamburger, fries, and fried zucchini on two occasions now and they were all simply average."}
{"text":"After 18 holes of golf under the blazing Phoenix sun in my old neighborhood, we decided to go somewhere for a burger and a brew. This place really hit the spot.  I had the 1/3 lb bacon cheeseburger (jalapeno cheese) and hubby had the ham steak & fries combo. Everything was delicious. The condiment bar was beyond fresh. The best part? The pickles were nice and cold (which is a big plus in my book...I'm picky about my pickles).   So you order on the food side, give them your name and then go sit on the (dive) bar side and get your brews and cocktails. This was definitely the best burger I've had in a long time...maybe ever. Be patient, it's definitely worth the wait for a made to order sammich. Nom!!"}
{"text":"The food was fine (chicken strips and fries for me, \"the big one\" for my boyfriend). It took longer than it should have to receive. That's not why I'm giving it four instead of five stars. The girl taking orders was rude and hard to understand and when I asked her to repeat herself she got an attitude."}
{"text":"Amazing retro Phoenix atmosphere, full bar, patio, affordable food and large portions. Definitely my first choice for a burger in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food here is freshly cooked to order (plus).  It does take a little bit, so if you don't have time skip this.  The burger are a good size, I only get the 1/3 and that is enough for me.  Buns are fresh and they have a toppings bars with a lot of goodness.  They have a 4 different type of ice teas to pick from.  The burger just taste OK, with cheese and bacon.  Nothing special.  French fries are good!"}
{"text":"We stopped by the original hamburger works for lunch today. I had never been but my wife has before and I remember her saying that she was glad to see a local mom and pop establishment like this was still open there and thriving after not eating there in years. When you walk in you're greeted by wood walls, vintage signs some that even light up, this is the kind of place that influenced the cookie cutter \"crap on the walls\" restaurant décor.  I ordered the \"classic\" which is the cheese of your choice with mushrooms and bacon.  We also ordered an order of chili fries to share. The burger is served on a no frills styrfoam plate., because that's what it is, an honest to goodness no bull$&amp;@t tasty burger. And it was just that a big carb riddled well made slice of heaven.  The chili fries we're also very  good, I could see myself just eating a bowl of the chili, they we're literally swimming in chili and cheese.  All in all it was a very solid choice for lunch, and I look forward to going back and trying other menu items."}
{"text":"My burger was delicious. The atmosphere is great with many seating options. I will definitely be back because while my burger was amazing, I saw someone's Fish and I want that."}
{"text":"I was disappointed my last visit on Monday, April 24, 2017. We went there for the bacon burgers and they did not have bacon. We received our order and the food just didn't seem as fresh as usual. The zucchini and chicken strips seemed as if they had been deep fried more than once and actually the chicken strips were hard. I didn't order the salad bar, but as I was choosing my condiments I noticed how unpleasant that looked as well. The $75 I spent was not worth it."}
{"text":"Real hole in the wall restaurant. Great burgers and fries. Burger and salad bar to choose your own toppings, which all seemed fresh.  Bad part of town. Service is abrupt."}
{"text":"GOOD BURGER.  Ordered the Teriyaki version, but did not taste very teriyaki-ish.  They surely just forgot to douse it with the sauce, which happens more often in burger joints these days than you would think........... other than that, and it being a tad pricey, the  burger itself was big and good and the condiment bar was a good idea.  I would return again when on a burger tear but will definitely double check the Teriyaki part of my order!"}
{"text":"This burger was the best I've had here. It was cooked medium well, not scorched.  In the past I have been critical of the price.  There was and improvement today."}
{"text":"If you like to eat and you're not a vegetarian, you've likely heard of The Original Hamburger Works. It may even be on the list of eateries that you \"must visit when in Phoenix\" depending on who you ask.  You order your meal at a tiny window next to the grill where the burgers are cooked. Flames leap from the cooking surface as you speak your order to the...order taker? I don't know what to call her, because you don't pay here, you only order here. You walk around the corner and pay for your food.  I didn't order the gigantic burger, I opted for the big burger. With fries and a drink. I paid about $9 for it and I was told to listen for my name while I got my drink from the digital Coke machine.  About ten minutes later, I hear my name and retrieve my food. There's a toppings bar with condiments to apply to your sammich. After one bite of this big burger, it's clear that it deserves steak sauce, grilled onions and salt and pepper and not the usual condiments and toppings. The beef is tasty and delicious and I am doing it wrong with lettuce, tomato, onions, Cholula and mayo. Without the bun and with a knife and fork, it'd fit right in as a \"chopt steak\" at most steakhouses.   The fries were not remarkable, but they were adequate sidekicks for the hamburger.   The part of town that the restaurant inhabits is a little bit run down. The parking available is suspect at best- the small strip mall on the corner has narrow spaces and on-street parking is limited. The clientele is a mix of tourists, neighborhood denizens and locals trying to grab a bite to eat.  Try it on a Saturday after 1pm for ease of enjoyment."}
{"text":"Great burgers.... but the best wings in town now that Minders Binders closed.  Order them hot and well done.  Yum and a half!"}
{"text":"We went to this usually very pleasant restaurant recently after attending the Lights of the World show at the Arizona State Fair Grounds.  We have been here before and had very pleasant experiences however, this time, was different.  There were 9 people in our party, 5 of whom were children.  As soon as we walked in, the attitude was one of dismay because we had small children with us.  The man who served us, I believe his name was Gregory, was very rude and tried moving us;  first to an isolated high top table which would not have worked for our children and grandchildren and when we said we would move to the booth near the bathroom so that we did not disturb other diners, he tried moving us outside!!!  Very rude and still we stayed and spent over $150.00 there!  We should have left and spent our hard-earned money elsewhere...somewhere where we felt comfortable.  I will never go to this place again which is sad because the food was good but we were made to feel unwanted.  I called Management when we left but he seemed very disinterested and unconcerned."}
{"text":"Went here again for the second time this past Sunday. I got a third pound bacon burger with American cheese on an onion bun. The burger was delicious just as I had remembered. Topped it with a little ketchup, onion, pickle and mayo and washed it down with a red cream soda. Also split some fried mushrooms and zucchini with a buddy of mine. It's not the fanciest place there is but it's just my style. Was able to watch a little football and have a great burger. Will be going again."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips! DELICIOUS fried mushrooms. The the burgers are just OK.  Their condiment bar always seems fresh too. I docked 1 star because the bathroom has a funny smell. Can't quite pin point it but ya...not very pleasant. Other than than, pretty darn good place to eat."}
{"text":"Wow awesome hickory smoked real BBQ burger best I've had in years. Worth the stop will be back!  The right kind of O rings too beer batter. Well back to eating"}
{"text":"WTFriggz!!! Actually, this place is obnoxious if you go alone for your first time... like Vegas.   Cool shit on the walls, old school Pac-Man or is it Centipede?? Now you get to stand in line like you're getting ready to ride Goliath at Magic Mountain. Today I gave my order to the head-cook. No! You don't pay yet, go over there and stand in line again... Ok, now you pay before you wait yet again for your lunch to be called out, first name basis. Your deliciousness comes served on a pizza tray. Why? Im sure Valley Pizza is looking for these.  Awww-shit! They have Barq's Cream Soda!!!  Ya know when you sat down to watch Alien vs. Predator and said to yourself \"Man! This is going to be awesome!'  Then the feeling you get when the credits roll. Hamburger Works is nothing like that."}
{"text":"Great burgers with even better onion rings! will certainly have to put this place on my short list when looking to grab a bite for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Not one complaint here, this burger place is right on time. Got \" The  Big One\" with American cheese and fries for $5.49. The place was packed when I was there during lunch time, we waited about 10-15 minutes to get our food, and I was VERY pleased with every bite.   They have a condiment bar to add your own toppings, all I added was a little mayo, ketchup, and mustard.....that burger was a flame broiled disc of greatness! Fries were perfectly crunchy and tasted extra special dipped in ranch.   The place has great atmosphere and a cute patio area to sit outside when it's a nice day, service was prompt and courteous....can't wait to go back here."}
{"text":"There are no menus here. Just a big chalkboard that dangles over you before you step into a short line and order your burger. The first thing you may notice is the \"Retirement Burger,\" with a price tag of a cool million bucks, and it includes the burger, a drink, and the restaurant. A cheap joke, or kinda funny? You be the judge, but I've caught myself chuckling at it before.   On top of that, the burgers here are rad. Yeah . . . rad. They cook them right in front of you while you wait and they have an entire table with condiments like fresh lettuce,  tomatoes, sweet relish and a few other goodies to complete your masterpiece according to your preferences. It's like a waaayyy less corporate Fuddrucker's. While you wait for your burger to cook up, I recommend an order of the 50/50 zucchini and mushroom appetizer to get you through.   I bought a Powerball ticket this week. If things go well, maybe I'll get the Retirement Burger."}
{"text":"Drove by and mom mentioned that she's always wanted to eat here, ever since she went to high school across the street at the now non-existent West High. With longevity like that, you know they have to be doing something right.  The setup is a bit like Five Guys or Fuddruckers - you walk up to the counter and order your burger and side. You have a choice of bun (white, wheat, onion) and cheese (American, swiss, cheddar, provolone). They call your name and you add your own condiments from the condiment buffet (which doubles as the salad bar). I really like this setup because you get to put as little or as much whatever you want on it. I wish they had some hot cheese like Fuddruckers, though. My burger with fries was $5.99 - they charge extra for cheese and extras like mushrooms or bacon. A soda with unlimited refills (and they have one of those crazy touch screen soda machines) was $1.79.   The burger was excellent quality and cooked just right - though they didn't ask how I wanted it. I guess they do everyone's medium? The fries were thick cut and really good. This place is definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Love this place! They grill the burgers in front of you over an open flame! I got the bacon cheese burger with extra pepper jack cheese and mushrooms! Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a dive bar - one that would be featured on \"Kitchen Nightmares\" or \"Restaurant Stakeout\". The decor was classic clutter.  The staff didn't say hello or make eye contact - they were too busy on their cell phones texting. The salad bar was from a bus station cafe. Well, you get the picture.   So why did I rate it 3 stars?  We sat in the bar area where the atmosphere was friendly and the L.I. Ice Teas were some of the best we've ever had!!!  And the food was awesome!!!!   The \"Border Burger\" was 5-stars all on its own.  The condiment bar (next to the wilted lettuce) let's you build your burger the way you want it.   It reminds me if the old saying, \"never judge a burger on its bun\"!!!"}
{"text":"This burger joint is awesome! Definitely would become a regular if I lived out in the area. All burgers are grilled to perfection with your choice of cheese, buns and variety of condiments. Also, the joint looks really cool, has a western style theme and feel with plenty of seating for larger groups."}
{"text":"It sucked a year ago and still does. Seriously, this could be a great neighborhood bar (maybe is to some with low standards). Bartenders ignore you and you just sit. ..and sit....God help anyone looking for any resemblance of customer service."}
{"text":"I am sure if my husband sees this he may just very well divorce me!  He has been going to the OHW since he was a kid, and even though I am an AZ native as well, I had never been here.   So last Friday after work, I said I need a burger and a beer, and we ended up here vs our usual Originial Wineburger (the 19th ave and Bethany location).   I thought the atmosphere was fun, they are going for the this-place-is-old-as-hell-and-may-fall-apart-at-any-moment-yet-clean look.  Our order was taken very quickly, but its kind of confusing that you order at one register and then walk around, and stand and wait to be noticed to pay at the other register only 10 feet from the one you were just at...but whatev.   Our food was out very fast! We each ordered burgers, then we split some fries and onion rings. The onion rings will get me to go back again, they were soooo good! The fries were ok. My burger was dry, had no flavor and the bun was stale as all get out.   The condiment bar, ie the build your own burger, didn't impress me. There was nothing special on it. Seriously toss some green olives on there and you may peak my interest...but everything on the condiment stand could easily be in bottles at each table.   I went to the bar and got 2 bottles of Stella...for $8, holy heck! Not cool. We sure as heck werent in Scottsdale last I checked we were in the avenues.   I do have to say, one thing that actually made my mouth drop open and then when I showed it to the hubs his mouth also dropped open in disbelief was that they have Barqs RED CREAM SODA!!! Thats like the holy grail of sodas right there! If they offered vanilla ice cream there I may have just moved in and lived off of red cream soda floats for the rest of my life or until I slipped into a diabetic coma.   If the hubs wants to go back I will not fight it only because of the red cream soda and the onion rings. But as far as burgers go, give me a Original Wineburger, I like burgers that have flavor, are juicy and on amazing freshly baked buns!"}
{"text":"Great burger at a great deal especially with Restaurant.com gift certificate.  Buy $20 worth of food for $10 buck.  Wife and kids had dinner here about 5 times and everytime we have left over.  1/2 pound of meat is alot to handle.  the place does need remodeling, has that old feel to it."}
{"text":"The Original Hamburger Works is one of my fave places to grab a bite. They have enough room to ensure that you'll always [well, ALMOST] always have a place to sit, the decor is muy retro/college hangout/rustic ambience and there's lots and lots and LOTS of burgers from which to choose.  You can even see your burger being cooked if you want--and no, none of the burgers have been sitting and drying out to year-old cow-patty consistency, which is another bonus. And there's a great variety of burgers, too!   And these folks are generous in the community, too--one year, they donated one whole day's worth of revenues to the family of a Phoenix police officer who had been killed in the line of duty.   And best of all, it's another local business, which all us Yelpers need to support!"}
{"text":"I dig the burgers here especially for the price.  Maybe it is the charcoal fired sear on the outside, but these things are great.  I jam as many jalapenos as I can on there and make myself cry every time I eat here."}
{"text":"Great place, fun setting, great value, great food.  Very ample servings.  You may not to order as many sides or dishes as you think!  You'll enjoy"}
{"text":"This was second visit.  Great burgers. Will definitely visit again. Only complaint, if I ever order the \"Retirement Burger\", cheese should be included at no extra charge since it comes with everything else."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was a young gal. Overtime, the burgers have changed a bit, to smaller portions. Yet, they are always killing it with fresh and tasty burgers! The fried zucchini and french fries were super appetizing, not too salty. No wonder it is called the \"Original Hamburger Works\"! It couldn't possibly get better than this!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good and I love the condiment bar.  Real potential kinda place. BUT the burgers are too thin and lack seasoning. The burgers were also seriously over cooked.  We asked for medium but got well done. Very disappointed as I was really hoping to find a great burger place."}
{"text":"The hamburger was amazing! I was a bit concerned about the condiments not being refrigerated on a wagon car but the food still blew me away. I ordered a classic. My daughter had a hot dog and it came on a hamburger bun which was interesting. My husband had the bacon one and it looked amazing. I will totally be back."}
{"text":"While struggling on where to eat lunch last weekend we came upon Original Hamburger Works.  Read the reviews here on Yelp and decided to give them a try.  I am sure glad  we gave then a shot.  We walked in to the dinning room which was pretty full (a good hing) and up to where you would make you menu selections. The great thing is you walk right past the grill where you see what is the beginning of your burger.  Awesome to see this right out front.  Kind of a honesty approach to how we build a great burger. So we order a Bacon Chess Burger and California Burger both the largest size burger.  Both burgers were exceptional and the prices were low to what you receive. Extremely affordable. The staff was great and our surprise the location is about 3-4 blocks from where we live. A win win! So if you want a extremely tasty, affordable, very large portion and just a all around awesome burger the hit these guys up. You will not be disappointed.  Just a great little gem on N 15th Ave. Once again you will not be disappointed at all......"}
{"text":"Completely running into this place by accident, without the aid of friends or yelp reviews, I am overwhelmingly pleased that I not only found a place I enjoyed that night, but for many occasions to come.   I wasn't really sure what to expect when I walked in, and at first I was overwhelmed. It seemed like a neverending lot of treasures to discover. There were old signs all over the walls, stop lights, the ads in the glass on the tables, a wagon full of 'fixins for everyone to add to their meal.  As I eyed the menu and gazed upon the rest of the establishment, there were a few tables occupied with an older group of friends and a young boy with his dad. There were also a few people at the bar, which I spotted in the other room as I finalized my decision. While I waited, I ordered a coke and loved that they had the digital you can do anything you want with your soda machine. Total win! I think I sat and played with it for minutes. Luckily there wasn't a line.   Overall the place has a nice relaxing feel in my opinion. It may look like it should be dirty, but I assure you its not. There's a huge part of the restaurant that is not near the bar for the family folk. Outside the bar is a patio that apparently has horseshoes. Oh yes, you heard me right. Who's coming with me to play horseshoes?  I ordered the green chili burger and it was amazing. Lids are offered for the plastic condiment cups at the 'fixins bar for those who are ordering to go, like I was.  Looks like a potential nice place to sit back and watch a game... or play horseshoes... :)"}
{"text":"This was such a huge disappointment. The fries took twenty minutes the burgers were burnt. All four of us were so disappointed. Heard another patron mention \"the retirement burger\" because by the time he got his food he would be ready for retirement. Ha ha he had to be about 30"}
{"text":"WOW!!!!!!!!!  This is one of the best \"hole in the wall\" diner/sports bars I've been to that was actually fun, great burger and the staff are all very friendly (a little slow), but friendly.  I was there with my son, grandson and cousin that was in town visiting.  We were all able to sit in the bar, watch the game (cards lost...no surprise there, but the bears won!), have a great meal and enjoy the ambiance.  I would recommend this to anyone, drinkers or non drinkers alike.  There is a condiment bar so you put on your burger whatever you want.  I enjoyed the Fiesta Burger and the guacamole was so tasty and fresh.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"If you are like me,  you are so sick of cookie cutter, bland chain burger joints.  That is the reason why I love this place so much!  I usually go with the \"On the Border Burger\" with fries and a cherry vanilla Mister Pibb.  The bar is worth hitting up too if you are in the market to throw back a few while any of the local Valley sports teams play.  Outside of that, the toppings bar is well stocked, and clean.  The food is always tasty and made in front of you with a relatively short wait.  The restaurant is easy to find on the south east corner of 15th Ave & Thomas.  My only star deduction is due to the fact that the tables are usually not cleaned well or fast enough.  I shouldn't have to clean up after the last customer, but most of the time I have."}
{"text":"Great spot with the family. Food was great. Place was chill....wish we had one back at home. Kids loved pac-man. Place Rocks!"}
{"text":"There's something incredibly charming about this place. Old and kind of dark, I live a couple miles away from this place and I had no idea it was there. Food was really more 3 1/2 stars but the fries were bomb and I was starving so I'm feeling generous enough to bump it up to 4.  I was with a fellow Phoenician who requested to remain nameless because he is weird. Eh fuck it, I don't care that much, it was Collin S. Mystery solved, woohoo.  Now on to the burgers. All beef ground patty was on the thin side, but I was totally cool with that as it allowed me to pile on 8 feet of toppings! For once I've found a topping bar that wasn't ill-kept and made me feel like dozens of chidren's unwashed hands had been rifling through everything. Flavorful and tasty and CHEAP. Have I had superior burgers? Absolutely! But not for the price of a McDonalds happy meal and that was A-OK with me.  Bottom line, Original Hamburger Works is the perfect place to go when you want a quality burger and fries at fast food prices with the luxury of a liquor license."}
{"text":"It's really good. It's affordable and provides a condiments bar so you don't have to worry about them adding anything you don't like. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yummy burger with jalapeño jack cheese also tried the wings both were amazing. I like the fact that you can add your own toppings and the burger taste so grilled and good! Girl at the registered wasn't friend though probably because she thought I was broke lol I couldn't find my debit card, which is a habit of mine lol then she looked at me more mad when I didn't tip psssh bye! You should still go here though it's really good I promise !"}
{"text":"This place has always been amazing. Since the time I can remember my family would come and bring me here to eat and now that I'm having a boy, I'm definitely passing the tradition down. Wife got the \"big one\" and I got the \"double big one\" and I couldn't finish. Atmosphere is relaxed. Definitely recommend his place"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. I really like their fiesta Burger  and Their bbq chicken sandwich too. Staff is nice and it's close to home :)"}
{"text":"Great spot, excellent food. Nothing fancy. Recommend the veggie burger with fries, they also make a mean fish and chips.  Bar is solid too."}
{"text":"My friends and I drove over from Ahwatukee for a steak and ham steak sandwiches only to find they have discontinued them.  These are what made Hamburger Works unique and set apart from restaurants.   Now they are just another hamburger joint."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in search of a good place for dinner, so I turned to Yelp and read the reviews of Original Hamburger Works. This place is close to where I live and the reviews convinced me to give this little place a try.  My friend  really loved his big burger and his cheap pitcher of beer, so he was satisfied.  Me? I thought it was just okay. I'm not into burgers.  I had the barbecue sandwich, salad  and iced tea.  This place is very inexpensive and the staff is nice.  Overall, this establishment deserves 3.5, but I'm giving it a generous 4 stars.  I do want to return someday  for the fried fish and try the appetizers."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Original Hamburger Works a few weeks ago and was pleased I did. the restaurant is a bit dark and has a dive bar/sports bar feel to it. We were a bit confused walking in on where we would go to order but made our way up to the first register. Complete lack of customer service or greeting by the young lady that took our order even though it was apparent it was our first time in. She did not let us know we would round the corner to pay and pick up our food. I ordered a burger and my husband ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and we both got fries. They have a great condiment spread laid out to customize our sandwiches and received our order within about 5-8 minutes of placing our order. We both really enjoyed the food, my burger tasted like it was off the grill in a backyard bbq, which I really liked. My husband was not a huge fan of the \"frank's red hot\" sauce on the sandwich but the chicken was juicy and the portion was large. We came back a week later and sat in the bar. Similarly lackluster customer service experience in the restaurant and in the bar, My husband ordered a hot dog which came butterflied. I ordered the burger again and it was just as tasty as I remembered. You can tell that this place sees a lot of local business and although the service and atmosphere are not great the food has been very good and keeps me going back."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I go almost every week for lunch between classes. They have the best fries around. I always order the Hawaiin burger, fries and don't forget the red cream soda. Hamburger Works is one of the rare places that carries red cream soda, if you haven't had it before you must try it. The staff here is always friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"My family and I go there often and they never disappoint ! Burgers are cooked just right and the wings are pretty amazing!  Plus they do have the coldest beer in town.. not much selection but it works."}
{"text":"My favorite hang out! We spend about three afternoons here a week. Good food, good company and laid back place to unwind!"}
{"text":"Though I rarely visit this place, I still find it the best place to fix your burger with your choice of condiments. Though the appetizers come in small doses, the onion rings are sweet and the zucchini are bite size. It has a nice open space.You can watch the current college game while waiting in line to place your order or find the best seating that you can watch it from afar.   [Some day, hope to see someone order the Retirement burger.]"}
{"text":"My husband's Burger was tasteless!  My Grilled Fish Fillet Sandwich was cold & also tasteless!  Salad Bar (if you want to call it that) was seriously lacking in variety.  Bathroom stunk & was filthy!  Personally, I don't think this place even deserves one star!  Seriously, don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"I do enjoy Hamburger Works - every once in a while, I just HAVE to have one of their burgers.  The basic cheeseburger and fries special #1 is all it takes to make me a happy boy, if a bit bloated.  The same cannot be said for the interiors.  If cleanliness is next to godliness, then the owners of this place must worship Satan.  Also, the place is in dire need of a redo.  A fresh coat of paint and some new furniture would really be worth the investment!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a unique place for a good burger. We found it with this place. I got a small burger with onion bun and American cheese. Hubbs got small burger with regular white bun. Rounded order off with onion rings and zucchini rounds. Everything was super good and cooked perfectly. I liked how they have a condiment bar where you can choose from the usual burger toppings like onions, pickles, tomatoes and lettuce. Also had some really good jalapeño rings. We will be back next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We were in the Phoenix area a few weekends ago and after we saw that Los Reyes de la Tortas was overflowing, I did a quick yelp search and saw that I had bookmarked OHW and we headed on over. The place has a huge dining room and a bar and patio off the back.   They were out of zucchini when we were there (huge sad face), but my friend and I each got a burger and some fries. They were pretty good, but they weren't the best burgers I've ever had in my life. I'd probably try it again if I was in the area, but I'm sure there are better burger places around"}
{"text":"Another really good hamburger place. Actually, this place is really really similar to the Chuckbox in Tempe. From the food to the environment to plates. But this is a good thing.   So I ordered the Big Hamburger with fries. After waiting for like 20 minutes (worth it), they called my name. The food smelled great. Like Chuckbox, there is the toppings bar. So I got my toppings and all that stuff. Time to eat.   So upon taking a bite into this burger, it was good. Great! Not Chuckbox great, but still better than like In-N-Out or something. The burger was juicy, the bun was soft and the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Sounds like a commercial, right? Because it looked that good and tasted how it looked which is usually not the case for food when advertised.   Anyways, this is a place that I would come back if I was in the area or visiting any of my homies from the west side. Other than that, I can get Chuckbox. But this place is worth a try at least.   :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. My gf and I split 'The Big One' Burger, Fries, and Wings. Affordable and I get to make my burger the way I want it with the condiment bar (wagon)!  Very cool that you can see the grill and I enjoy the laid-back atmosphere. Bar is optional and they do have the newer style coke machine which is a nice option if you drink soft drinks.  The wings are some of the best in the valley! Zipps are my favorite, so you get a gist of what type of wings I like. The ranch here is the real deal as well, which makes a difference. Not bottled or bagged ranch like many of the restaurants use.  The ONLY issue I have here is that the burgers are cooked WELL done. Xtra well my visit yesterday. BUT, still are great because of the charbroil flavor. I usually order my burgers rare to medium rare (don't have that option here), so I'd rather get a burger at Fuddruckers, but the fries are better here... and the wings and other sides are great options that separate OHW from other restaurants. We had fried zucchini and fried mushrooms as well because my gf's parents ordered them... Everything was more than satisfying and we all had a great dinner! Worth a shot for sure! The restaurant has been here (Phoenix Metro) long before many of us have!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Divey (in the best sense of the word) with good and large fried burgers that taste just the way they should.  Big juicy chicken sandwich too.   Fantastic chili fries that are probably going to have me drop over dead sooner, but good eats.  Tap beer in the side bar. VERY friendly people.    Hadn't heard of this place before a good friend showed us the way tonight, but this is the place to head when you want to keep it simple and enjoy just a danged good burger and a  beer."}
{"text":"The menus online are just to lure you in. The food is good some days, great other days, and occasionally it's just crap. It depends on who is working. Worth the gamble? Guess you'll have to find out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hamburger place and it's close to my house. I always get the border burger and over load on my condiments and veggies."}
{"text":"tl;dr--dude, it's a large, edible burger place with a dive bar attached. Anyone who eats meat will survive settling here, or at least drink until they enjoy it. Oh, and portions are gigantic.   It's alright to me, but how much you like it all depends on your burger philosophy, a key portion of your path to self-realization. Let me explain.  Places like OHW make it incredibly difficult for me to evaluate what a good burger is. I feel like we're hitting this beefy new paradigm in which we have all these old-school, no-frills, blue-collar, gruff, and rustic little restaurants, but they're endangered. You know, the tough ones that have been around for like 40 years? The ones where you wouldn't be surprised to find sawdust in your food? Well that's this. And it's ugly on the outside and on a corner that no one cares about, but the people are humble and it if you squint hard, it kinda feels like someone's house. Don't ask for a custom order, go to the cart of condiments and do it yourself. If that sounds appetizing, go for it. Can't go wrong with the wings either, which are spicy and generous to the point I can forgive them needing a bit more sauce. Also, I got a bit buzzed here. It's cool that you can do that, but honestly it's weird with so many families running around. 5 o'clock HH crowd was abundant, but TBH I don't wanna hear or see third graders running around.   Back to burgers.    Anyway...I understand times are changing. If you like 'modern' burgers, you won't like this place. If you like the high-traffic, high-rent plazas and bright lights and gaudy, uniformed staff and exotic cheeses and maaaaybe a craft beer. If you like places that let you order in advance online, or even maintain a functional website, OHW is the antithesis to that and you'll have no shortage of alternatives. You will honestly hate this and want to go away to a place that has Wi-Fi and doesn't make you feel delicate.   So there you go. Find out which kind of burger person you are and achieve your carnivorous nirvana."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the fiance and parents for dinner last night....   Wow, in the worst possible way, just wow!  The food was the same as always... but I would recommend not getting the Small One, burger isn't big enough to get enjoy the flavor.   The service, if that is what you can call it was horrid! My mouth was agape most of the evening in disbelief. \"Did she just do that?\" Was pretty much my thinking. First my mothers wine glass was disgustingly dirty, never should have been brought to the table. They when she asked for a new one and pointed out how dirty it was the bartender looked at it like \"Umm looks fine to me..\" and just wanted away. We watched her put the glass back on the rack with the other \"clean\" glasses and grab another one. She didn't inspect it to make sure it was clean before handing it off, this one was just as dirty and had lipstick all over it. Me being a bartender asked for a rocks glass, figuring they would be cleaner and less lipstick, she handed me a shot glass. WHATEVER I took it and gave it to my mom. Once she finally came back to the table we pointed out the hideousness of the second wine glass and in the same fashion, probably more irritated, inspected it said \"Okay?!\" walked back behind that bar and put it back on the shelf. Are you kidding me?!?! Were we being punked? Ridiculous!   Like I said, the food was good, but the service was out outrageous! I hope they read this and get their shit under control. The behavior is unacceptable for a McDonald's.   I am sure we will go back someday, but if she is there, I will leave, if not I will stay but make sure to only order beer in a bottle, no glassware!"}
{"text":"Burgers are one of those things that have branched out into several sub-genres. The Original Hamburger Works sticks with the classic, hand-shaped and flame broiled. Yes, much like you'd make at home.   This isn't a fast food burger. This isn't a gourmet burger. This is a BURGER. And a burger place that you want to eat at.   The chili cheese fries are sick. In a good way. Love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place it's basically you order the type of meat you want on your burger and it you can put as much as lettuce pickles onions etc"}
{"text":"Best Burger for the best price in town hands down! I eat here once a week. Cool sports bar attached with TVs everywhere. Love it!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  I like it a lot.  I'm a sucker for run down places with good food and a kid friendly atmosphere.  I've never eaten anything here that I wasn't happy with."}
{"text":"We just happened on this place the other day. It is a little out of my normal stomping grounds. When there are hamburger joints all over the place - both fast food & local neighborhood places - it takes a really good burger to make you want to return to a specific place when gas is expensive & time is short.  Would I go back? Food was definitely good enough. Not gourmet, but a good \"home-cooked\" tasting burger. Best part about mine is that I ordered it with green chile on it. (Remember I am from the Land of Enchantment?) Instead of coming with canned chopped chile, it came with a nice big slice of real roasted green chile. I ordered it \"mild-hot\" and it was perfect. Tasty, without covering up the burger flavor. These folks definitely know the difference between chile & chili. Family must be from New Mexico?  Oh, yeah, i scarfed every last crumb of that green chile cheeseburger! And now I'm craving another one. Guess where I'm going today?"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid, and now that I'm an adult, the booze just sweetens the deal. Is it the best burger you'll ever have? No, but it's still pretty darn good. You could pay the same price for a \"value\" meal at McDonald's, or you could come here, watch a game, have a beer, and maybe play some ping pong. You should also probably try the fried zucchini. It's delicious! Maybe I'm biased because I love fried food, but really, who doesn't?"}
{"text":"Have been somewhat of a fan for years, however, tonight was definitely not a good night. 3 out of 4 of us have been sick for the past several hours. I hope whatever it is/was gets resolved before they start serving food to the paying public tomorrow. Sorry for the bad review guys but this is pretty serious."}
{"text":"I went to Hamburger works for probably the 3rd time.  Decent hamburgers, HORRIBLE service.  We got there and sat in the bar.  We were there probably around 11 am on a Saturday.  There were only 3 other people in the bar area.  The bartender came out and took our order.  2 out of the 3 other people came after us.  We waited a good 30-45 minutes when we noticed the 2 other people got their food before us. The issue with this is that the waitress/bartender wasn't busy and knows her customers (or should know).  We called her over (after 30-45 min) and asked where our food was.  She left to find out and came back and said she never put the order through.  She said she'd get that taken care of.  My husband and I asked to pay for our cokes and that we were leaving.  She gave us the drinks for free (she better!!!) and we left.  We went to another hamburger joint and had great food and service.  Never going back.  The food is great but the service isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever! They taste like they were homemade on a grill or something! Good pricing and their fries are also very yummy. I ate there for homecoming and food is always adequate quantity, unless you order otherwise."}
{"text":"Price was great for fresh grilled burgers which you dress yourself with their condiments bar.   The condiments bar wasn't elaborate - just the basics, but I did find that the burger and fries were loved by my daughter as well as freshly cooked, great service, and large dining area in a nice neighborhood.  We would go again.  Nothing organic/natural about this place though."}
{"text":"Being convenient to Encanto this was a after golf lunch stop for me and my buddies. Yesterday I ordered unlimited salad bar for close to $6 which is more than most burger entries.  What a limited, sad assortment of limp offerings with everything having traces of it's neighbor as if there was a food fight.  With the dim lighting and greasy plastic sneeze guard it gave the veggies Gaussian blur I imagine you get just before you croak. If the bar in Star Wars had a salad bar this would be it complete with interesting and diverse looking patrons.  After lunch over our empty paper plates, plastic utensils and round aluminum pizza tins we made a vow to never return.  Black tee shirts for the staff, dim lighting and grease everywhere brought on thoughts of a prison mess hall during a black out. With all the choices in Phoenix we will have our lunch in a cheerful environment with personable servers and fresh food"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burgers....Fresh and juicy and hand-made.  The condiment bar is fantastic and they have A-1 steak sauce !!    The patio is really nice, situated in a courtyard and off the street.  Always a joy to visit this burger joint."}
{"text":"Fiesta Burger was. Excellent. Onion bun, jalapeño cheese. Very original and tasted excellent. Don't love the cafeteria vibe but I'm stuck up like that though."}
{"text":"Wow, have my tastebuds and service needs changed! I remember coming here a few years back and I thought this place had a much better burger. Okay, the burger wasn't that good, very dry and really flavorless. Maybe that's why they have the fixing bar to add something to this burger. The service was as exciting as our burgers and made numerous mistakes and really didn't care that they did. I don't want to waste much time on this review, but I will say one positive thing. This place is very affordable and would probably be a good place to bring the kids. My review reflects my feelings of this burger joint. Blahhhhh"}
{"text":"I used to come here about once a week about five years ago.  Then I realized just how much more expensive it is than the Chuckbox and that the food was really going downhill here.  The burgers are usually overcooked, and they want almost $2 more for Zucchini than Chuckbox.  I ate there the other night with a friend and it is still about the same.  There's more room, a bit more going on, but I'm there for the food.  The one thing I will say is that they have some better iced teas, unlike the fountain crap at the Chuckbox, but that's about it.  I still go occasionally, but since I'm out in Tempe regularly, I'll stick with Chuckbox."}
{"text":"Come and enjoy a DELICIOUS burger !        First time here !  I'm impressed really nice place , the staff it's friendly, family atmosphere and if you want to watch games they have it !    The burgers are DELICIOUS , and in top of that free refills and the condiments bar ,what I personally see it a great idea !"}
{"text":"I like this place. I went to Phoenix College across the street and I know don't come at lunch if you'd like to sit and study or if you just want a leisurely quiet meal. Now, I bring my little family in occasionally and we are never disappointed. The reason for the 4 stars has to do with length of wait. Sometimes they can be a little on the slow side but I don't really mind."}
{"text":"Craving a burger from the grill?  Go to hamburger works.  Unlike a lot of hamburger places in town this place cooks your burger on a real BBQ like the one in your backyard.  Well sort of :) their BBQ is a lot bigger!    Ordering is kind of weird you order at the station next to the grill then walk around the corner to pay and then they call out your number.  I think they do this so that you can walk around and see the burgers grilling and the kitchen.    On the other side of the place there is a full bar.  They also have an outside eating area and back entrance.    The food is awesome.  I have been here pretty regular since I discovered it on yelp.  The buns have always been fresh and the burgers are grilled so they are not as juicy and greasy.  But thats a good thing.  They have an awesome flavor! The condiment bar is pretty cool.  You get the standard fair.  This is pretty much a build your own burger place.  I like to take my burger and put lettuce tomato onions and thousand island.  Its like an in and out on steroids!   The fried fair is good. Im not a fan of their french fries I usually go for the half mushroom/zucchini combo.  But if you get a combo with fries I recommend getting a ranch cup from the condiment bar and dipping them in that.  Their ranch is so good!     The Chicken sandwich is also good.  Get the plain unless you want to be covered in sauce.   Overall I love this place this is a great family restaurant and you wont break the bank.  Only thing I would knock a star off is for customer service.  About half the time the person behind the counter seems to have an attitude for some reason.    Will be back for another burger."}
{"text":"I've been going to The Original Hamburger Works since my father brought me and my sister here in the 1980's. So I really have great memories of this place and of dad. My dad is no longer with us but every time I'm there I think of him.   The burgers are grilled over a mesquite fire (so are all other options).  Best BBQ burgers in Arizona.  My husband and I have tried,  wings,  grilled chicken sandwich,  fish and chips,  grilled fish sandwich,  veggie Burger, salad bar and various soups.  All of it is delicious and worth trying.  I think the \"chuck wagon\" style condiment set up is the best you put what and how much on your Burger/ sandwich that you desire.  Personally I put minimal toppings (I don't want to hide any of that delicious mesquite flavor).    Go start  a family tradition today at the Original Hamburger Works(you won't regret it and will feel great supporting a local business.)"}
{"text":"Not sure if it's all new staff, or new management, or what - but the quality of the burgers the last couple times has been markedly different.  Mine was over cooked both times though I asked for medium.  Tonight they seemed under staffed or inexperienced - salad bar was a mess - most of the tables and booths hadn't been cleared either.  Hopefully just a couple off nights and not a new trend."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Great place for a good old fashion hamburger, fries and a beer."}
{"text":"If you want a burger customized to your own taste with the standard condiments at a cheap price, in a Bonanza style setting with wood benches and tables, then this is the place to go in Phoenix.  There is a choice of about 6 different style burgers to choose from cooked to order on a wood fired grill.  If you want a cheeseburger, there are 3 or 4 different cheeses to choose from.  I love the fact that there is a condiment bar where you are free to pile on as much stuff as you want, hello pickles, hello mustard, hello mayo, hello tomatoes.  You even get your choice of white or whole wheat bun!  The soda fountain features some unique choices including red pop, and there is a good selection of sides that you can order  including chili cheese fries.  The decor is all Old West and I fully expected to hear a lady in a cowboy shirt and a 10 gallon hat ring a triangle to let us know our food was ready.  Seating is ample.  OHW is unfortunately just another burger joint with nothing special warranting more than 3 or 3.5 stars, but it's a consistent meal at a fair price."}
{"text":"Great neighborhod bar with awesome ($2.50 pints in frozen glasses!) prices.  Hamburgers and fries are pretty decent.  Potato with chili cheese was huge (but cost more than my beer) and yummy.  Super friendly and awesome service, plus a large outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Wow, what a really good burger.  Went here on the recommendation of someone local, and i was really impressed.  The condiment bar was great and i like the old style tables.    The only negative things i could say is that the wait was a little bit longer than i expected, and the place is a little dark.  they should throw up some more lights, imo."}
{"text":"This place has a lived-in, part-of-the-neighborhood feel that I really enjoy.  And if you want to see an artist at work, watch them perfectly land burger patties on the charcoal grill from several feet away, bing-bang-boom, one after the other, and none of them out of place.   The results are delicious...except for the buns.   This seems like a terrible place for a hamburger joint to economize, but they have.  The buns are dry and flavorless, which is a real shame, because it takes away from what would otherwise be an outstanding burger."}
{"text":"This is really the perfect place for a college area.  Too bad it is wasted on Phoenix College.  The place is big, cluttered with cool stuff on the walls, and has a bar & a smoking patio.  The ordering process is fast and makes it easy.  It's like Fudruckers but edible.    I ordered the Hawaiian Burger.  While it wasn't as good as the one I used to get at Goofy Goose in Tacoma, it was still pretty good.  The patty was huge, hand-formed, and perfectly cooked.  The bun was tasty.  There was ample Swiss cheese and teriyaki sauce on the burger as well.  The only complaint was that it only had one pineapple which was a 1/4 the size of the burger.  I really only got the full \"Hawaiian Burger\" experience when I got into the middle where the pineapple was.  Oh well, it was still good.  The side order of fries was tasty enough and their onion rings looked good.    The condiment bar was a bit lacking.  I was hoping for lots of different sauces like honey mustard or horseradish but it was pretty much the basics.  The salad bar didn't look all that good to me but why are you getting a salad at a burger place?  In all, great burger, good prices, and exactly what I expected.  WAY better than Burger Studio."}
{"text":"Never going here again!!! Apart from the fact that the food was bland and the wings were mediocre at best (not even spicy) my son got food poisoning from there!!!! Hey burger works, food handling isn't all that difficult!"}
{"text":"I used to come here every other week for the past few years ... After tonight... Never again..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is really nice. I came on a Sunday afternoon and it was great. That staff was amazing. Friendly, honest, and helpful, they made selecting  my burger easy. The condiment bar was awesome as well. It's convenient to make your food the way you want. My favorite things about the place are the flame grilled burgers (yumm), the honey mustard, and the fries were equally delicious.  My one little critique that keeps this from being perfect, is I like my burger cooked to a certain wellness, so I would have liked the choice. But that burger was still good though!"}
{"text":"The menu is almost identical to Chuckbox... even the burger names.  I've been trying to find out if OHW & CB are \"related\" or just shockingly similar.   Went there for the first time yesterday for an early dinner with friends.  Love the \"shabby\" decor - the ancient cig machine by the front door was bitchen.    The burger was great - although Chuckbox is a wee bit better, in my opinion.  You can taste the smoke on the meat better at Chuckbox.  Plus CB has this excellent hot sauce... OHW just had Tabasco.    We didn't enjoy the outside accomodations but they looked really nice - patio seating, games, etc.  It was just too cold yesterday.  The bar was separate so it's definately a kid-friendly place.  We decided to get a milkshake after my friend's little boys came back with one that was so dark and chocolatey looking.  Never seen one so chocolatey looking!  I was shocked at the price ($5.41!!!!) but have to say (and my husband agreed) that it was well worth it.  Definately the BEST chocolate milkshake I've ever had.  And worth the $5+ pricetag."}
{"text":"Hamburger Works has become our after work spot after a long and busy Sunday at our restaurant.  Staff is friendly, the beer is cold and the food is good.  Reminds me of a burger shop from the 70's.   Salad bar/wagon is a hit with my friends, as well.   Great job!"}
{"text":"Whenever i'm craving a good burger, i come to this place!  Always order the big one combo, think it's the number 1, on an onion bun and cheese.  When ordering you don't need too customize at all, because you get your order and stop at the little salad bar to pile on the works and condiments...pretty good deal!  I'm always satisfied when i leave this place, good simple rustic atmosphere--and a bar in the back doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"What a delightful little gem. We went here to grab evening burgers during a weeknight.   This is a first for me. I was so preoccupied enjoying myself I have *zero* pictures of my food.   Yep. That happened.  The decor is retro and super cute. Lots of old school signs which I snagged a few photos of. (Just not the food!) The outdoor patio seems pretty nice but my review is only of the indoor bar area. We wanted to watch some of the sporting events going on.  I tried something on the adventurous side called a \"Hawaiian Burger\". This is a slice of pineapple with teriyaki and provolone cheese. Such an interesting mix of flavors! I'm definitely a fan!   And then (oh boy!) I wedged in slices of jalapeños, tomatoes, lettuce (ok, that's not cutting edge) and a smattering of mayo. This totally worked for me. I love jalapeños. (I can't possibly imagine having a 1/2 lb burger. 1/3lb burger seemed more than enough!)  I was tickled pink that there's a little condiment wagon you can help yourself to. Even tho it was evening everything on the wagon was super fresh. (No wilted lettuce for me!) Also, it's worth noting the fries are crunchy and not at all on the soggy side. (I snagged one from my fella. Delish!)   Evening crowd seemed to consist of local area folks. I'm told clientele during the day is more of office and hospital employees. This place is super kid friendly. The kids really seemed to get a kick out of the soda machine. (Where you press a button and different soda streams out.)  We were checked on a number of times by employees, even though we were not sitting anywhere near the bar. Gotta love great customer service!"}
{"text":"I chuckle to myself (and to my co-workers) when I wait in the Disney-like line at Original Hamburger Works.  We all frantically discuss what we want and if we can have a bit of their this or that---- I'll get this, you get that, then we'll share and then let's get fries, oh wait, maybe Onion rings- or both and then I want a large drink right? or is this the place with the massive drinks?  Maybe I'll get a smaller one-- oh, hell- I'll get a large one and a mushroom burger and fries and onion ring and I'll load up an entire extra plate of condiments and stuff my face with pickles until they call my name.    So this is what it is like at the Works for me--- can't you see why so much love?   The chicken strip are disappointing though, get a burger.   P.S. 4 out 6 times here-- there have been a group of firemen eating there too--- yummo."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house. I pass it all the time. Why didn't I stop in sooner? Who knows. This place is very cute inside, kind of retro...kind of reminds me of an old school Fuddruckers from when I was a kid. Also, this place has a bar! With specials! I clearly didn't realize this. Anyway, I went here last Friday and got a burger with cheddar, guac, grilled onions, and bacon... It really tasted like a backyard BBQ burger, which I liked. Nothing fancy here. The husband had a burger as well and enjoyed it. The bill was under 20$ I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Checked this place out after some of the reviews and thought it was OK. I can see why this place can get busy with its well sized burgers and proper pricing to go along with it during the week and lunch time for many.   The decor is nice and suits it for making you feel like your in a cabin bar, but wait there is a bar around the corner hah.   The ordering style is a la carte, with every add of extra cheese, tomato, onion etc adds to the costs. I ordered a big one with cheese and my wife ordered a small one with onions.   My burger was a bit more juicier then my wives, but had the same taste as if they had been bbq'ed. The quality tasted a it below angus patties but good for overall.   The fries were good.   Compared to other popular gourmet burger places I would say that for the money that it is a good buy, but if you don't mind spending the extra for better quality suggest going elsewhere.   Overall: It is a quick bite during lunch, or before a ball game, but would not be a an out of my way to go here type of food place."}
{"text":"Well I came here with coworkers for lunch today and i must say, the experience left a lot to be desired.   The place seems kinda dusty and dingy when you walk and there an unappetizing looking salad bar/condiment table that you line up next to when you place your order. I went with a bacon cheeseburger on wheat. The bun was just a grocery store bun, standard american cheese, a bland under seasoned and overlooked burger. The bacon was great, but that's honestly the only thing I liked here.   There are better places everywhere you turn with the trendy burger joints popping up a lot in the valley. The fries, which I didn't order but my coworkers did, appeared to be frozen. I just hope for more- get fresh ingredients- make your fries- season the burger. Pass on this place and take your hard earned cash elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not in a burger mood, I went for the fish n chips. Hello, rubbery batter! *pfffffft* (that's how you spell the sound a fart makes.) Fries were yummy.  Ordering process was organized. *ppffffffffffffttttttttttt* I like the different varieties of tea.  I don't like mine sweetened. Good lunch hour crowd.  Lots of men. *ppppffffftttttt*"}
{"text":"I love their  burgers and bomb waffle fries! They have a divey bar in the back where you can chill out and watch sports while you enjoy a  beer and your burger. Everyone is very friendly and makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"Overall: I recommend it! Food: Amazing Price: Worth it Service: They nice for taking orders and very informative if you're unsure about anything. They don't serve u at your table. You just order what u want and they'll call you when ur order is ready. (Similar like a fast food style)  Details: Food: I'm not all that crazy about hamburgers. But I definitely found a hamburger place that I really like. So I'll be coming back soon.  Price: The price ur paying for is the meat and the bun. And then the salad bar is optional to put in anything you want on your hamburger.   Definitely a place to try if you like hamburgers or not haha."}
{"text":"It's a process for ordering... just be patient... it is worth it.    Burgers were big, buns were fresh and there was a toppings bar.  Loved the fries.  Hated the the drink dispenser where it has 1,000 drink choices but only one outlet.  Keep it simple like everything else and it would be more customer friendly.  Plenty of seating, staff is a little sassy and there is plenty on your plate.    Loved it."}
{"text":"Yummy Yum Yummers! Great place for a burger! I'm never disappointed it.   Awww, man and you totally have to try the fried mushrooms. Bad for your cholesterol but good for that \"happy place\" in your belly.  I agree that the condiment bar is always fresh and kicks butt. Bonus: It comes with a sneeze guard for germ-o-phobes like moi!  And as long as this place exists, it makes it hella hard for a sista to go Vegetarian.  Hint: As with every place in the \"uptown-ish\" area, go early or late if it's lunchtime to get a parking spot or you'll be circling that little parking lot for several minutes."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place to eat or drink or both. It has a nice bar area and connected to it is a good burger restaurant. I ordered the \"big one\" which is an little bigger than an average burger and very filling. I also had a side of the cheese poppers and they were soooo good. Love this place definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"When I was a student at Phoenix College, I stopped in frequently since they're across the street.  I don't have the opportunity to visit as much anymore but it's always such an incredible thrill when I do.  I have a hard time eating a lot of hamburgers these days as most places just don't offer anything that satisfying.  McDonald's - which I actually loved once upon a time - doesn't even taste like a hamburger at all anymore; the only sensation I get biting into one of their burgers is the taste of over-processed chemical mixture.  So when I am in the mood for a really good burger that I know will please me, satisfy my craving and at the same time is reasonably priced, this is one of the main places I turn to.  The burgers taste just like a good hamburger should.  And no \"where's the beef?\" scenarios here...you get a nice big plentiful patty!  The condiment station allows you to dress it up just as you like and the fries are also an excellent complement (amazing how rare it is to find a place where the burgers and the fries are just as good as the other.)  Looking over some of the other reviews here and I'm both shocked and surprised that there's numerous mentions of poor service which is something I've never experienced in all the times I've ever visited.  Long wait times, yes but never bad service.  But then mind you, I'm not a drinker and don't use the bar and it seems like the bar portion is where a lot of other people's complaints are directed towards.  But me personally, I've neither experienced nor witnessed poor service so I can't factor that into my own rating/review.  Nice comfortable cozy atmosphere, excellent food which tastes like one would hope and prices that are completely fair.  I wish I lived closer so I could go more often."}
{"text":"Burgers, fries, zucchini, chili fries were all on point. The staff was great, fast and friendly. Perfect spot to bike ride, enjoy football and drinks. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Good hamburgers, chicken and fish sandwiches.  They cook over charcoal and that gives a great taste. And a condiment bar so you can pack on the lettuce, tomato, jalapenos, etc.  BUT:  No CCW, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is old school Phoenix funky and cool.  Across from Phoenix College it has a real niche along with some tasty burgers.  The burgers are big but very good.  Flavorful and topped with many different types of burgers - teriyaki, western, Big One - all sorts of choices.  Get some homemade fries and onion rings to complement that tasty burger.  Now, to wash it down they have one of those high tech fancy schmancy Coke dispenser and it is fun.  I like getting the Cherry Vanilla Coke Zero.  It is fun and they usually have some local sports on and they have a full bar where you can have an adult beverage with your burger.  The staff is always courteous and the food is really good.  We go by here whenever we want to have a good meaty burger that is local and part of the community."}
{"text":"Yesterday morning, we went to St Joe's to see our new niece. She's 6 pounds 14 ounces, 17 inches long and I absolutely love her! Less than 24 hours old, Patience Marie is quite possibly the most miraculous thing to happen in my life since the births of my nieces in Ohio.   So, seeing a newborn can certainly work up an appetite and since we were in the neighborhood, we decided to go to Original Hamburger Works. My mother-in-law shared a story about her last visit here, as we left the hospital. Apparently, on of the barmaids was celebrating her last day by exposing her breasts and allowing male patrons to feel their suppleness. Or offer their services in checking for abnormal conditions. Of this I was unclear. But, we verified that Original Hamburger Works does indeed have hamburgers so off we went.   This was my first time going to OHW, and I must admit it's a bit confusing--especially if you come in the back entrance. Just so you don't walk in and take a seat (and look like a fool waiting for someone to wait on you) here's the lowdown: Proceed to the main dining area and get in line. Before you order, be aware there are many choices: First, if you're ordering a burger, they come in various sized--small one, big one (1/3#), double big one (2 of the previous patties), great big one (1/2#) and super great one (+1#). Then there's the buns, either onion, whole wheat or white. Then, there's the cheeses: Swiss, cheddar, jalapeno jack, American, provolone). If you're too intimidated to build your own burger, there are about half a dozen specialty burgers from which to chose. We ended up getting the Big One special, which came with fries for $5.49 but does not include your drink. Don't worry, though. They have a fully stocked bar in the next room!   After your name is called, you can doctor up your burger with their selection of toppings. I went with the simple scoop of mayo. You do know white people love mayonnaise? Truly a wonderful burger.  How I'd never been to OHW prior to this weekend is beyond me. I know I'll be going back again and again. We did not, however, have to be subjected to exposed breasts during our visit. Unless you consider the ones of the chicken being grilled next to our burgers."}
{"text":"After having fully recovered from my nightmarish Burger Studio experience, the Husband and I decided to try another restaurant that specializes in burgers.  This time, however, was a completely different experience.  The menu has an offering of burgers, chicken, and fish and chips.  There are onion rings, fried mushrooms, and fries for sides.  A few other items round out the simple item and everything is very reasonably priced, most being under 6 dollars.  I chose the bacon cheeseburger with American cheese and a wheat bun.  A pleasant surprise is the fact that you can choose between white, wheat, and onion buns.  Yay!  We also got a side of fries to share.  The total for 2 Works burgers, a side of fries, and 2 sodas was about 16 bucks.  Not bad at all.  I could immediately see that I was getting a good burger when I took off the top bun and visited the condiment bar.  The burger patty itself was large and slightly misshapen, definitely a hand formed patty.  The condiment bar has pretty much all the typical fixings that you would expect.  This was a good burger.  It was well seasoned, nicely cooked, and had a great charred taste.  The bun was fresh tasting and a nice change from the typical sesame seed burger bun.  The fries were portioned for one person, but they were substantial and tasty.  I really enjoyed this place from the cheap prices to the awesome vintage decor.  The tables were brushed copper and very cool looking.  The entire restaurant is actually larger than it looks from the outside and even has a bit of outdoor seating.  There is a decent sized bar on the side of the restaurant that everyone seemed to be having a great time at.  If I am in the mood for a no-nonsense good quality burger, I will definitely come here."}
