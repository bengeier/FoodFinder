{"text":"I remember this place from a few years ago, and went back tonight for the Cha ca/La Vong Fish. It was as good as I remembered."}
{"text":"Y Lan has been a family favorite of ours for a while. Each few weeks or so, we would go and enjoy traditional vietnamese food. Coming from a vietnamese background, this place really hits the spot.  There are many traditional plates served there, such as banh xeo (vietnamese crepe), cha ca (fried fish on dill), nem nuong (pork meatballs) and the list goes on.  The pho (soup) is very good as well. My personal favorites would be the bun bo hue (hue-style noodle soup), banh tom chien (shrimp on fried sweet potatoes) and their general tao chicken, which has an amazing sweet and sour combination.   The service is friendly and helpful when indecisive, the price is right, it's a BYOB and the food is great. For a traditional vietnamese meal, this is one of the best places in town and has a good location (walking distance from metro beaubien)."}
{"text":"Mon restaurant vietnamien préféré depuis des années!!! Le poisson est un régal et la soupe au poulet ou au buf est délicieuse!  Le calme et la lumière des lieux me conviennent très bien."}
{"text":"Menu typique asiatique, le service à été fait à une table de 5 et de 8 arrivé après nous mal grès que notre groupe était de 6 personnes.  Le poulet était limite trop frit."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant demeure ma place préférée pour un pho. Les saveurs et la qualité de leur soupe demeure consistent à chaque visite!"}
{"text":"The service is always good. The food is AMAZING! I'm Vietnamese and I'm telling you this place serves authentic Viet food. The fried fish dish (Cha ca La Vong) is the best I've ever tried, fried shrimp dish (Banh Tom) is also amazing. And surprisingly, they have really really good Chicken General Tao. The portions here are generous with lots of fresh veggie. And did I mention it is BYOB?"}
{"text":"Um, the fried fish dish is wicked good. It's a meal for two or share it with a group and get a soup too. Nice staff and...bring your own wine! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Recommend this place for the pho. we went there when our favorite restaurant across the street was closed. We had the pho soups with boeuf saignant, and it was very good. A large is good enough for a meal. We also had appetizers (rouleaux) which were not so good.  We also took some take out, beef and noodles( we were told were tasty) and came out right before we left, which was good.  Price wise it's pretty decent and we did not have to wait long to be seated or served."}
{"text":"Family owned joint that is always welcoming & gracious! Once you become a regular, they treat you like family (and stuff you up with healthy servings!). I cannot get enough of this place. I actually have to hold myself back from going week after week. It's so delicious.  I fully recommend their Vietnamese hot or iced coffee, all of their pho is delicious but I fully stand by the grilled chicken & vegetable pho, as well as their imperial rolls, spring rolls, and their lemongrass beef bowl. EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS! Oh, and it's BYOW so it's just a super lovely Vietnamese option owned by a really sweet family!"}
{"text":"Went to try this place as a last resort because the restaurant in front had a line up and we were in a bit of a rush. Ordered the special dac  biet  and it was so salty. The noodles we're so soft and the meat was overcooked.  I felt that my meal wasn't made with love. The place was empty and felt like there was no \"life \" in that restaurant. I wouldn't go there again ..."}
{"text":"Super friendly service with the best pho soup I've ever tasted. This is one of my favorite places in Montreal for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Restaurant vietnamien ouvert le mardi, c'est ce qui m'a permis de le découvrir car je vais à celui \"d'en face\" habituellement. J'ai testé le bo bun : bon mais sans plus, ça manquait de parfum. Le plus, c'est un apportez-votre-vin. Le moins, la salle est vraiment cheap."}
