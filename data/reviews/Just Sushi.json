{"text":"3/5! Great sashimi but too much rice on the maki rolls. The fish is very fresh & melts in your mouth. Slightly overpriced for what you are getting but we would come again (great place for a quick bite prior to Costco shopping)."}
{"text":"I've gone back a number of time to try different items on the menu, have not been disappointed yet.

The miso soup is like no other place in the GTA, it doesn't taste like instant soup mix.

The sashimi is fresh and melts in your mouth, you don't even need wasabi.

Maki rolls are nicely made with just the right combination of rice and which ever type of ingredient you pick depending on the roll you order."}
{"text":"I'm proud to have such a conscience restaurant in my community! Love the food here and it's attention to quality. The fish is always fresh and melts in your mouth. In particular I recommend the toro, mango shrimp roll and spicy salmon skin hand roll. Most menu items and organic, locally sourced and sustainable. One of my top choices for healthy take out!"}
{"text":"I am, admittedly, a sushi snob.  We were hoping for a little taste of Vancouver but were sorely disappointed.  

We ordered sashimi, some toro and sockeye salmon nigiri, and a ginger soda.  

The fish was mediocre at best.  Not silky, not smooth, not melt-in-your-mouth.  Some pieces were even fishy which made the experience that much worse.  The colour, the texture, it was all off.  

I should've said something.  I definitely could've said something.  Your fish is bad?  It wasn't spoiled.  The slices were decent in size.  It just wasn't... tasty.  You know when you eat something and you're like \"Mmmm...  Whoah....  SO GOOD...!!!\"?  Yeah well this wasn't it.  It was more like, \"Geez...  I spent 40 bucks so I'm going to eat it...  Dammit...\"  What could I have said?  Nothing.  

If you want some rolls, if you want to be ethical about your fish consumption, that's all fine and dandy... because you will like it.  The feel-good aspect: \"I'm saving the fish!  I'm doing the right thing!\" I get it.  I want to do my part too.  However, if you're looking for fresh, traditional sushi or sashimi, you must go somewhere else.  

The information from newspapers and online through social media, and of course the Ocean Wise certification brought us in, but the food itself (blech) has completely turned us off from returning."}
{"text":"Love Just Sushi. It's always fresh and you can truly taste the difference in the quality of fish. Also the only sushi place that serves real crab, which is amazing. Even their miso soup was better than the usual. I highly recommend it for great takeout."}
{"text":"Meh just about says it for Just Sushi. I really wanted to love this place - it's a three minute walk from where I live.

For a $50+ order, we expected more.  

The positives:
The fish was fresh.  
The sustainability thing is a nice 'plus' for those who want to do the environment a favour.

The negatives:
The fish cuts were small, thin, and the presentation was just 'ok' The fish seemed 'set' on top of the rice, but it wasn't shaped to it.  Perhaps it was because it was a delivery order. 

The shiso leaf was a nice touch, but it was bitter/not fresh.  This could be a supply, storage, or seasonal issue.

The rice was bland.  Sushi rice is an art.  Sushi chefs spend years just perfecting this.  Just Sushi's rice tasted like plain, unseasoned rice.  The white rice had no flavour whatsoever, and the purple rice, although somewhat flavoured, was not so great in terms of complementing the fish that lay upon it. The texture was too firm, but this is merely a personal preference.

Just Sushi:  You are in my neighbourhood and I'd love to see you succeed.  I have lived in Japan for 10+ years, so I feel that I probably know sushi better than the average connoisseur, as I've eaten in cheap 'kaiten sushi' basements in Japan, and I've also eaten at the top sushi restaurants throughout Tokyo, Sapporo, New York, Hawaii, and various other locations.  

Please research how to make great sushi rice.  It should be slightly salty, slightly sour, and slightly sweet.  It is an art.  If nothing else, please Google how to make sushi rice and you'll find a plethora of information available.  I make sushi rice at home, with organic white short grain rice from a common grocery store, with salt, organic white sugar, and rice wine vinegar from the same location, and it has a fabulous taste that has received rave reviews.  It's difficult to get it perfect, but it is certainly not difficult to get it close to good sushi rice.  Sushi isn't about cooking a pot of rice and squeezing a blob of it together and throwing on the fish.  

If you are going to make the portions as small as you do, please compliment the diner with miso soup/seaweed salad.  

Your ginger (Gari) is good, but a little too sweet.  Toning down the sweetness will allow for the more subtle flavour of the ginger to be realized.  It will also allow the ginger to serve its purpose; cleansing the palate and reducing the risk of bacteria-causing upset stomachs.  

Good luck, and thanks for reading this.  Best of luck in the future!  We may try you again at some point, but for now we'll likely continue to make our own sushi or order at a location that is less sustainable, but more filling."}
