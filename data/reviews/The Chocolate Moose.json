{"text":"THE MOST ABSOLUTE awesome little Eatery I've been to in this whole Area!!  Love the Food, Love the People, Gail and Nicky are so Friendly and Sweet!!  Awesome flavor combinations!!  I just Love this Place!!!   SOO Coming Back!!!!  Darlene Tempting Treasures by Jan"}
{"text":"While the staff was pleasant the wait was very long for only having two customers in the shop as they also had two employees helping the one customer. After being helped I selected the black cherry cheesecake to go. I was very let down by the product. I normally love cheesecake but this one was flavorless, I was expecting much more as they charge 6 dollars for a personal cheesecake."}
{"text":"I went in thinking I was going to only get a sweet or two.  However when I saw they also had sandwiches, I ordered the turkey club on marbled rye and it was gooood!  After only finishing half my sandwich because the portions are very generous, I had multiple desserts, which were all super tasty and exactly what I wanted.  The \"moose\" is a very nice treat and is not like any I'd tasted before.  This is a gem of a place with a great family friendly atmosphere and excellent food."}
{"text":"Everything here is wonderful. The moose is perfect. The cupcake shake was a great mix of ice cream and cake."}
{"text":"Found it, like most people, after coming out of galaxy theaters. My friends and I stopped inside and the staff was so lovely and willing to talk about the product and there were plenty of samples to try.  I've been back like 3 times for a chocolate Cronut. It is absolutely phenomenal and I love it. And it's nice that someone there remembers me from the piercings that I have on my arm!  Sadly I went today, at 7 pm on Sunday and it's closed but it says it's supposed to be open until 9?  definitely still deserving of a five star review of course! I was just a little let down I don't get that delicious Cronut."}
{"text":"My dining partner and I agreed that being located adjacent to a movie theater, the addition of coffee and icedtea and a selection of herbal teas  would greatly enhance this potentially fun establishments foot traffic. Seating is limited to three tables with four chairs and benches indoors. The concept seems to be more geared to take out. We ordered three desserts and one salad and in lieu of an icy glass of iced tea, a Mango Italian soda. They don't call it an Italian soda so tell them you want sparkling water with the flavor in it. There's a lack of attentiveness from the young lady taking the order. She seemed very unsure of herself and I'm wondering if going back to a simple order pad for taking orders might be helpful. The salad ordered was not available due to \"no fresh strawberries at the store that morning \".  The Mandarin salad was no bigger than many side salads we've encountered. Very simply a pile of spinach mandarin oranges, and a shaved hard cheese. The salad is served  with a tasty poppyseed dressing. Presentation as most foodies know is a big part of our enjoyment of food. Very simply if one were to take the item served here from their plastic containers and placing them in a simple dish, the value would be greater. Case in point, the chocolate mousse, was served in clear plastic  cups similar to in-flight beverages a board most domestic flights here in the United States.  Since coffee and teas are not on the menu, perhaps offering and attractively advertising a selection of milk would be a perfect option. Some delicious lemonade would be refreshing as well. Especially in the desert heat where we live, we need to be able to walk into an establishment and order very simply a beverage. Not all diners drink Coca-Cola products which are offered.Now regarding the chocolate mousse If this creamy delicious treat were served instead in a selection of mismatched porcelain teacups with the fancy but inexpensive flatware spoon,ordering a chocolate mousse at the chocolate mousse would be elevated to more of an experience. Save the plastic \"dishes and flatware quote for takeout orders only. Footed cake stands contain a variety of unique cupcakes that we found difficult to pass up. As tempting as the maple cupcake with A mound of rich looking frosting and glazed bacon was more intriguing, was the Butterfinger rum cupcake. It was rich it was delicious and like no weather cupcake I've had before. There are several cupcake joints in Henderson but this was the best cupcake I've had from any. The cupcake is represented in this review by the additional third star given. After eating it, I had to remind the young lady about my fizzy mango drink. Offering gourmet hot cocoa could be the saving grace for this business. I am imagining custom hot chocolate flavors to pair creatively with The wonderful cupcakes. I'm looking forward to seeing how this business continues to develop I would like to be able to grant full five stars very soon."}
{"text":"Ran in here the other day right before they closed to get cupcakes for a coworker. The service was great and more importantly the cupcakes were delicious!!! I got the vanilla, snickers, and mounds cupcakes. Can't wait to go back and try their shakes."}
{"text":"Surprisingly spacious bakery spot in the same shopping center as Green Valley Theater- probably a good option for a post-flick snack, thought they do have some competition in the way of the froyo place in between.  Service was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. We were offered samples of their namesake Chocolate Mousse, which was nicely light and tasty. Ultimately chose a seasonal fruit tart and a cheesecake cakepop, despite the tempting selection of cupcakes. Total was slightly absurd, just shy of $9, which felt a little excessive- would expect that on the Strip, not in suburbia.  The chocolate cheesecake pop was unremarkable- very chocolatey but in a dense way that overshadowed the cheesecake tones. The seasonal fruit tart (a fabulous-sounding mix of pumpkin and sweet potato!) was nearly $6 and not nearly as life-changing as the price led me to expect. Pairs well with coffee but didn't have much flavor. Overpriced for sure, a bit turned off to give them another try- maybe stick with cupcakes and cronuts instead of specials."}
{"text":"I came across this place while walking with the intention of going to another food place in the area. I had never seen or heard of the place, and I almost missed it. I bet if they go the word out more they would do better.  But I must say that the food I had was pretty good and the service was nice. The lady informed me that she and her daughter opened the place four months ago, so I like that it's a small shop. I had the turkey pesto panini. She had let me try a bit of the pastrami, which was also good, but the turkey, pesto, spinach and mozzarella just sounded too good. It did take a little while to make, but I figure that's not a horrible thing. At one point the daughter came out and said the turkey pesto is her favorite. The short interaction with her was nice too. And the time it took to make the sandwich gave me time to ask a friend what kind of cupcake he wanted. The cupcakes look DELICIOUS. I saw several comments about samples, but they didn't have any while I was there.  The panini was pretty good, and it came with a pasta salad (or you can choose potato salad or chips). That's wasn't the most flavorful, but it wasn't bad. I got a sweet potato cupcake and a chocolate peanut butter cupcake. Haven't tried those yet, but I can't wait. They also have ice cream and other desserts that looks great.  My only hang up is the prices. The cupcakes are $3.25 plus tax each. The panini was $7.99, which isn't horrible but also isn't cheap. With a fountain drink I paid over $17. For lunch for one person and two cupcakes. For a place that doesn't have a reputable, established name yet, that seems pretty steep.  But overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Alright this place won me over, especially with the latest sweet treats I just took home.  Everything that we tried or sampled was freshly made.    The peanut butter cookie was my favorite! There's peanut butter actually swirled into cookie, topped with bits of peanut buttercup...score!  If you are a chocoholic you'll find the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake pretty decadent. Lemon Cream cake won both our votes to take home after we were offered a sample.  Can't go wrong with their cupcakes. Everytime I get them, the flavors are spot on, and the cakes are super moist... and what I realized on this visit.. freaking good deal compared to some other bakeries nearby. 2 cupcakes, a Lemon Cream cake, a Chocolate Mousse cheesecake and peanut butter cookie set me back thirteen bucks!..  wow. ... Dollars well spent here than that \"cronut\", cookie, and drinks that I paid the same amount for at my former hangout (GSS) ... hope they keep making more of those peanut butter cookies,  I can see myself coming back for more!  (hint hint)"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend while we waited for our movie to start. I was so hungry and we both always have a sweet tooth. I ended up getting the Aloha Sandwich. It has ham and cheese and a homemade pineapple spread. So. Good!!!! And we both got two shakes. I got mine with a cupcake in it! I really like this place!! The mom and daughter are so nice! We got samples of the moose and different ice cream flavors too! I'm a fan! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my daughters to get something for a special dessert.  We took home one of each cupcake to make a 1/2 dozen.  It was like Cupcake Wars came to life in my kitchen.   The flavors were unique and fun and bold and delicious.  The cake is moist and the icing, so pretty and flavorful.  Can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"My brother and I got a Key Lime Pie and it was pretty amazing, except for the price. It was over $5 and I cried. Other than that, the place was really chic and I even loved the cookies and cream cupcake sample that they gave me."}
{"text":"Awesome place with great desserts! They have sandwiches and other hot food but didn't get a chance to try them. If they are as good as the desserts, then I know I won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ok, so here is the sad part. I didn't actually get to try it. BUT the dozen (plus one) cupcakes I got for a group loved them. I popped in to grab a little \"thank you\" treat, and was pleasantly surprised to meet one of the owners (family) She was so friendly, and helpful. The décor is adorable, and not over the top. Sometimes when people go the route of log, rustic, it just comes across horrendously ugly. This is tastefully  done. Almost like urban rustic. Yep. That just happened. New genre of interior decorating. BUT you don't care about the décor really. You care about the cupcakes. It was love from everyone. I did get to try the mousse, which I wish I had a bowl of right now instead of this crappy tea, but if you get a chance, stop in. Love places like this and I hope they do great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had some time to kill before our movie and stopped in.  The staff was friendly, the shop was clean, and the environment was cozy,calm, and inviting.  The chocolate moose and the cheesecake were incredible.  I can't wait to go back and try their other desserts."}
{"text":"My office co-workers stared in envy while I ate my birthday cupcake. i tried to savor it, but it was sooo good i ended up gobbling it up instead.  Guess I gotta try again."}
{"text":"Omgoooodness the most amazing sweets and shakes and snacks in town! Hubby had their signature chocolate mousse cheesecake and a salted caramel shake, I had a cinnamon and brown sugar shake... Phenomenal! And the owners are just as sweet as the treats they sell!"}
{"text":"After a long day of moving out of my condo, my friend and I needed something refreshing. She check yelp and The Chocolate Moose popped up... we looked through reviews and some people mentioned a CAKE SHAKE! A cupcake and ice cream mixed together to make a shake... it sounded interesting so we thought we'd give it a try.   Its located in the same plaza at Smiths. Really cute decor, but limited seating. It only had 3, 4-tops. The lady working there was so sweet, and helpful. We were both given samples of her chocolate mousse, which I enjoyed. She told me that she sold them in a small or medium cup and she also made some sort of chocolate cake with chocolate mousse covered in chocolate. It looked really good, but I already had my eye on one of the cupcakes. Maybe next time I'll give it a try!  Cupcakes are $3.25 for regular ones and specialty ones are $3.75. There were only 5 flavors, I'm not sure if they change daily. There was caramel chocolate, butter scotch, german chocolate, pina colada and chocolate peanut butter. They all looked AMAZING but we settled on one caramel chocolate and one butter scotch. Apparently their caramel chocolate cupcake is their take on the samoa girl scout cookies, which are MY FAVORITE.  ** I tried the caramel chocolate cupcake and felt that the frosting was wayyyy too sweet. The coconut chocolate topping was also very sweet, and I couldn't finish the entire thing. I ended up scooping off all of the frosting and just eating the cupCAKE part. The frosting probably hardened overnight so it came off easily. The cake part itself was moist and quite good. I probably won't order a cupcake again unless its in a cake shake.   There are 12 flavors of thrifty ice cream... I remembered 2 interesting flavors, blood orange and a cinnamon something that tasted exactly like horchata. My friend and I decided to go with chocolate brownie and mint n chip. It's about $2.89 or so for a single scoop... which is on the high side, but Thrifty ice cream shops sell a single scoop for almost the same price. We were able to try the ice cream flavors before making a decision.   I saw that they also sell other items like sandwiches, cookies, scones, cheesecake... but next time I come back I'll give their cake shake a try! I'm so glad to have found this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Me and my kids love trying out desert places on the weekends and this is a must return too place. Glad is down the street from me on Green Valley. I love the cupcakes!"}
{"text":"Holy cow... So delish! We stopped while leaving the Galaxy and were so excited to find this new sweet spot. We sampled the black cherry ricotta cheesecake and purchased one of those as well as a chocolate lava cake (comes with ice cream--yum!) and a chocolate Snickers cronut to go. We haven't tried the cronut yet, but the other two desserts were awesome. We'll be back for sure!! Super cute place, free samples, and friendly service. Check out Chocolate Moose to satisfy your next sugar craving!"}
{"text":"Love Chocolate Moose!! The cupcakes are delicious and they're always so nice and offering you plenty of samples. I've even had the owner give us some extra cupcakes for free! Very family friendly and fun environment."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little gem and had The Moose! Oh my goodness the combination of cake, moose and rum flavored chocolate frosting is perfect. I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and while their baked goods and cake shakes are good, their service is abysmal. Don't come here if you're in a rush or on a lunch break. One of the workers, the blond elderly lady, messes up on the register every time she rings you up so someone else then had to fix your order so you pay the right price. My cards now have the security chip so you're required to insert it inro the reader, both times when I tried to use my card, their card reader didn't work and they said they didn't know how to run the card. The attempts were over a week apart so they had plenty of time to figure it out in between. The last time I went in today, for a sandwich, cakeshake and a mini cheesecake for my roomate they handed it to me without a bag so I had to try to balance everything while in a rush because they made me late by taking over 20 minutes for an order that should have taken 8 minutes tops. I can't tell you how it was and my roomate didn't get her cheesecake because the balancing act I was forced to try to juggle fell. The lid of the shake wasn't on securely and popped off in my car so I have to get that cleaned out before it cooks too much in the 100+ degree summer. What a waste of $22, I'm not going back and don't recommend."}
{"text":"So sad.  We were very excited to see a cute new shop in the shopping center.  Could not wait to try them.  Found them on Facebook and saw that they sell cupcakes.  We got four different cupcakes and two cronuts.  Unfortunately,  I have to say these were the worst cupcakes I have ever had.  We got one Nutella and could only taste a coffee flavor in the huge amount of frosting and the cake was really dry and flavorless.  Next,  was the cinnamon/chocolate (hot cocoa) way to strong in the cinnamon and again cake was dry and flavorless.  Third,  was caramel apple and it had a weird fake flavor and the cake was terrible.  Last,  was chocolate chip cookie dough it was the only one that I thought was just okay.  The cronuts were in the hot cocoa and strawberry, the strawberry was okay, but WAY to sweet.  I think the prices (we paid $23.00 for this order) were very high for cupcakes, but if they were outstanding I might see paying it.  I will say the customer service was great.  Sorry to say to repeat customer here."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful, I live clear on the other side of town but try to get in there at least a couple times a month. All of the cupcakes are tasty, along with the cheesecakes. I love the sandwiches as well. Their service is great and the decor is beautiful. I highly recommended this place if you're looking for a sweet treat or lunch in general."}
{"text":"This spot is definitely an asset to the area because we are seriously lacking in bakeries. The Chocolate Moose is located in the same busy shopping center as Gallaxy Luxury Theatre.   The inside of the shop is very clean and simply decorated with a slightly rustic feel. There are a few tables for those that want to enjoy their baked goods right away.  The shop offers a nice variety of sweets. They have cupcakes, Thrifty ice cream, cheesecakes, cake pops, cookies, and chocolate mousse. Cake shakes are even an option- just choose a cupcake and an ice cream flavor and they'll blend it right up. Both of my visits have been for sweets, but they also offer sandwiches.   On my most recent visit I tried the chocolate mousse. My mom makes the best chocolate mousse in the world and CM's sweet treat is almost as good. I was very impressed. I was torn between chocolate mousse and cheesecake when I noticed the chocolate mousse cheesecake. Perfect. I loved the buttery chocolate graham crust with the chocolate mousse and chocolate ganache topping. It was really good and I'm not normally one to choose chocolate desserts.  The cake shake was calling my husband's name. He chose the coconut pineapple ice cream with a key lime cupcake. Wow! This was SO good. The consistency was perfect as well.   I hope the Chocolate Moose sticks around for a long time. This area definitely needs spots like this!"}
{"text":"Got to give it 3 stars. The place is nice, the staff are really friendly and nice. The baked goods are all excellent. But I was not at all impressed with the ice cream. It's $2.89 for a single scoop -- for that price you can buy a whole carton at Smith's and it's about the same quality. I'd go back for a cup-cake or a cookie.   I just took a sample taste of the mousse and it was pretty good. Maybe i'll try that next time."}
{"text":"Very clean eatery. Unspeakably amazing desserts. The cupcakes are a masterpiece. The mousse is good enough to be placed in a Michelin starred restaurant. We also had a turkey pesto sandwich, equally amazing. All in all, this place should be included in your go to places to amazing your family and friends."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our food. The cupcake milkshakes are great!Great customer service and the place is very nicely decorated."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The staff are always friendly and welcoming. The cupcakes are to die for! It is the perfect after the movie treat."}
{"text":"The popularity of Galaxy Green Valley Luxury in Henderson, is opening up opportunity for new businesses. Occasionally, when I go to the movie theater when there is time to kill, I like walking around the area hoping to to find a unique eateries and avoid indulging in movie theater food.   One of those shops is The Chocolate Mousse which serves up delicious cupcakes, cookies, cake shakes, ice cream and surprisingly house made sandwiches. As I walked in I was greeted by a nice lady by the front counter.   She introduced me to one of the most popular items, the chocolate mousse cupcake. It's a chocolate cupcake with chocolate mousse on top covered in a thin chocolate hard shell. As I took a bite, the silky smooth mousse oozed out of it. I had it with a scoop of black cherry ice cream, it's simply divine.  The bakery is nicely decorated with antiques, it's warm and inviting place to sit down to enjoy my dessert. I also took a couple of soft, chewy red velvet cookies to go.    Unfortunately they don't serve lattes, I happened to order ice cream so I didn't need it. I guess I'll have to drink a glass of milk as an alternative. I have not had the sandwiches yet, so a return trip is necessary which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I totally forgot to write this but I cannot forget this homemade chocolate mousse. The amazing owner is so sweet and it is her secret recipe. Try this you will love it. My husband loved the shake with the cupcake in it.   We will be back. and Thank you for treating us so special.."}
{"text":"After going to the movies my husband and I noticed on the marque a notice for 'the chocolate moose' we saw some very nice looking treats but could not figure out the location.   A week later we are again walking out of the theater and saw the same marque, so this time we drove around the shopping center until we found it. It's tucked between the casino and the theater.  Once inside I notice the 'menu' wall and a listing for sandwiches and salads. The cupcake listing the favorites and prices for large orders, what I didn't see is the food. I mean they were out of almost all cupcakes and their glass bakery case was nearly empty!  For 1130am on Sunday, I thought I'd see lots of things, but was surprised to see it bare. They had a handful of strawberry cupcakes and a few lemon blueberry. But the other cases were empty.   The big dessert case at the end had maybe five items but no items were labeled on display, I asked about one, I thnk he called it a greek yogurt cheesecake? I picked one of those and a lemon blueberry cupcake, both very good, flavors strong, cake moist and the chhesecake very dense.   There were others in eating lunch, they had ordered salad and a sandwich, I notice they had a list of breads for the sandwich and they made each order fresh.   I was disappointed in the lack of choices for cupcakes and such but impressed with my order, will definately be back to try again, hopeful it's just new business jitters!"}
{"text":"Walking into this place takes you out of the city and into the feeling of a small cabin in the woods. The staff and environment is clean, friendly and it is relaxing to just hang out. The paninis are on point and the side pasta salad that comes with them is super. Best part are the cupcakes. Taste homemade and not all beefed up with too much sugar! Returning customer who loves this place!!"}
{"text":"Like everyone else, we usually come in here for cupcakes and shakes and dessert stuff. Yesterday, we tried their sandwiches and OHMAHGAWD. I got the veggie sandwich with the cream cheese spread and it was perfect. Veggies were fresh, bread was delicious and the spread added a great flavor to everything. My boyfriend said if he could marry a sandwich, he would marry the turkey pesto he ordered... If that's not a true compliment, I don't know what is!"}
{"text":"Great cupcakes and free samples! We got the Chocolate Mousse, chocolate chip cookies. Service was courteous and genuine."}
