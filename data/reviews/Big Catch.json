{"text":"Big catch is defenetly one of the best sushi in Calgary. The service is good but the food is just delicious. If you don't know what you want just ask them and you won't be desapointed with their recommendations."}
{"text":"This was the best uramaki I have ever had! So flavourful and creative, and I say this as someone who lived in Japan for a number of years. Their presentation is also fantastic.   ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????my husband"}
{"text":"If you want good, fresh, clean sushi, this is the place. I've been to numerous sushi joints in this SE area, and this place never disappoints. Staff is great, very friendly, recommended some great sushi dishes that taste amazing. They are hopefully opening a full size restaurant soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Fresh sushi, creative rolls, and super friendly service. Try the miso soup with the salmon dumplings. The miso is not too salty and the dumplings are melt in your mouth.  They also have a fresh seaweed salad, which is a mix of sweet and crunchy, and a really cool Japanese soda that's a mix between cream soda and sprite, but on the less sweet side. Comes in a neat bottle that they will show you how to use. Yes, the bottle requires instructions."}
{"text":"Big Catchwas great sushi place and the chief was super nice! I went for first date and was so nice and we were sooooo full we  ordered the dinner for 3."}
{"text":"The best of the best sushi - I hardly miss a week without going to Big Catch - the best I have had in Calgary and Vancouver.    The young men running the business are quite personable and charming and take great pride in what they are doing.  Not only is the food delicious and fresh is presented as beautiful work of art. If you love sushi do not miss checking Big Catch out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"These guys make amazing sushi and are super friendly. When your sushi arrives, it is so pretty that it makes you forget you're having lunch at a Farmer's Market. My only wish for these guys is to some day get a place of their own!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi joint in town.   The staff are attentive and friendly. Their sushi presentation is impeccable! Wasabi dragons, squid flowers, and radish petals. They even made me a wasabi bear for my blog! You can see them prepare the sushi as soon as you order it so it's super fresh!   I have tried almost every single roll on their menu and have never been disappointed. Wait, OK once. But that was because the 911 roll didn't burn my tongue like I thought it might have. The sushi rice is also perfectly prepared, something that is often lacking at other restaurants.   If you haven't tried some Big Catch sushi, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"I'd dare to say Big Catch is the best bang for the buck \"utility\" sushi place in the city. Simple, gets the job done. Nothing fancy, but not meant to be.  Yes, it's a take out place. But for the quality of the food and the value, it can't be beat.  Moreover, they are extremely knowledgeable about gluten free options, offering tamari and replacing the sauce in their rolls with gluten free versions.  Also, I need to recognize their service. Non is amazing, always courteous, always remembering your name and your order"}
{"text":"I love this truly Japanese sushi bar. Wild Pacific Salmon (a first for me in a Calgary sushi bar). Delicious yam tempura. Reasonable prices. I know that this will be a weekly stop for me. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"We have been to Big Catch too many times to count, and keep forgetting to write a review. First time was for lunch, and thereafter regular Friday night takeout.  In the summer, they were open past the farmer mkt hours so very convenient for takeout. Service is always excellent. Sashimi is amazingly fresh!  All the rolls are delicious, fresh, tasty, and beautiful. Can't say enough good things about this place!!!!  Never have been disappointed - definitely my go-to place in Calgary for sushi."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi in a casual atmosphere. I come here quite often and they never disappoint. Limited but focused menu and you can tell they care about their food.  Fish is always excellent, and in all the times I have been never had a bad meal. Very friendly guys. Totally recommended!"}
{"text":"I love Big Catch.  Both my daughter and I are gf and they will ensure you your dietary restrictions are accommodated!  You can order half roll orders on most rolls too , if you can't decide on what to eat! Non and his team are great! Can't wait till they are open full time   Green halo is my six year old's favorite dish these days. Amazing people and food in a casual setting."}
{"text":"I should snap myself why I been there so many times and haven't write a review about them....... Sorry Big Catch...   This is a hidden gem inside the farmers market serving fresh quality raw seafood and prepared by ethnic Japanese sushi chef in Calgary. I always ordered Spicy Big Catch roll and seaweed salad couple times in the past, and it was fresh, good portion and well decorated on the plate presentation with modern garnish and hand crafted wasabi.   Services always busy but they always walk by and double check with us, to ensure their customer satisfaction into high standard of what products they served.   I will definitely return for their Spicy Big Catch roll and other rolls. However, their spicy sauce always changing, sometimes it was perfect spicy, and sometime it was overly sweet."}
{"text":"Delicious, exceptional service and beautiful presentation! Big Catch is located in the food court area of the Market On McCleod. They have a pager system to alert you to when your food is ready so you can browse while you wait and know exactly when your food is ready. Their prices are reasonable. They make an effort to be friendly and assure customer satisfaction. They also put effort into presentation - fun! They offer a frequent user card. This has become the go-to sushi lunch place for my daughter and I! :-)"}
{"text":"This is a great little sushi stand in the Calgary Farmers Market that is sure to satisfy any sushi lover but also has non fishy rolls for those who can't eat raw things. I'm in the former group and I really enjoyed my solo visit on a Thursday for lupper (between lunch and supper hour). Try the spicy catch combo because at 14 bucks it's super filing for 1. The staff is friendly too ;)"}
{"text":"I've been on a sushi kick as of late (see: always). More so than usual, as I've had it 3 times in the last week. After the disappointment that was Kin Sushi at YYCFM, I was hesitant to get sushi again at the Farmers Market, but what convinced me to try out Big Catch was:  A) The positive reviews from trusted Yelp homies  B) The varied vegan options on their menu  C) The friendly sushi chefs that were making rolls right before your eyes, rather than making them all in the morning and packaging them in sad looking Safeway-esque trays  D) The long lineup  I ordered the Veggie Catch Combo, which consisted of their veggie roll (romaine lettuce, daikon, avocado and cucumber), avocado roll, and cucumber roll. I also ordered a seaweed salad.   The server taking my order noticed that I had ordered vegetarian items and let me know that their seaweed salad normally comes with caviar on top, but they would be happy to leave it out. He also gave me a Big Catch card, which is a card they stamp for every $10 you spend. After you hit ten, you get a complimentary roll. After paying, I was handed a beeper and told my dishes would be ready soon.  The wait wasn't very long, and I was presented with a beautiful tray of food that was garnished with the most adorable carrot, radish and wasabi flowers. Everything was delicious, and I really appreciated that the veggie roll wasn't so large that everything fell apart the moment I dipped it in to soy sauce. The care for preparation was very evident with each bite. I also appreciated that their pickled ginger wasn't dyed a bizarre, nuclear shade of pink. The wasabi at Big Catch ain't nothin' to eff with. It's wonderfully potent.   The only downside to Big Catch is that they're only open 4 days a week, and only during 9-5 (with takeout hours during 5-7), but if you can hang tight until the end of the week to fill your belly with huppay sushi goodness, they are worth waiting for."}
{"text":"I've had a physical addiction to Big Catch Sushi ever since they came to the Market in the late Spring last year.  The things they do with sushi are so wicked that even the appearance of the rolls cause me to fall in love.  I have NEVER, and I mean NEVER EVER had better Sushi in Calgary and perhaps anywhere else. They use fresh, tasty and sustainable ingredients and prepare it for you the second you order it. The guys are friendly and knowledgeable and are not only Sushi Masters, but artists.  The more success that comes to these guys, the happier I am."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in Calgary. Great value for money spent. These guys really know what they are doing. Can't wait to try for items on the menu."}
{"text":"First of all, this is not a restaurant. It is a small area in the market. Second, this restaurant has no sushi at all. It only has rolls and small amount of sashimi. If you order solely sashimi, you are ripped off. To be honest, its rolls taste like anywhere else rolls. So i don't like this restaurant. If you want to eat sushi,sashimi and rolls, just go to another one, even Japanese food buffet tastes better than this. Frankly, I don't recommend this restaurant at all unless you are rich and you have no Japanese restaurants available nearby."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite sushi stops in YYC. It was our then-9-year-old daughter, and sushi aficionado, who initially got us into this place. The fish is always fresh, tasty and beautifully prepared. And all for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"So the truth is...I am super picky about where I go out to eat.  Don't get me wrong, I am not a picky eater, I just feel that when I spend money on food, I want to enjoy all aspects of eating out.  Having said this, I am a huge fan of Big Catch!   I have eaten here at least 20 times in the last 1.5 years, and I will continue to go back.  I am a celiac and I find it difficult to find restaurants that understand how important it is for me to have gluten free, cross-contamination free food, and Big Catch really does understand this.  They have plenty of GF options available, and they will also modify menu items to make them gluten free, they will also prepare the food separately. Yay!!!  I have not had any issues there the entire time I've been a customer which decreases my \"celiac anxiety\" by 95% (I must retain 5% for personal expediency ;)  I like that Big Catch is located in the Market on Macleod.  I don't normally visit during market hours, but afterwards when the market stalls are closed, but Big Catch is still open.  At those times the tables of the indoor courtyard are only occupied by other customers of Big Catch.  I find the environment cozy and unpretentious.  In warm weather, you can also eat outside on the picnic tables.  I wouldn't exactly call the food fast food, as each order is made to order, and larger orders can take some time.  Down to the most important part of the review, food and service.  I have not found a sushi place in Calgary that rivals Big Catch.  The food is expertly prepared and presented, and is always of high quality, with fresh ingredients and actually ripe veggies (avocados etc).  I have enjoyed every roll I've tried, the sashimi is excellent and I actually crave the miso soup.  I find the food to be reliable and consistent in quality, the service is the same.  Always excellent service, very friendly and accommodating. Shout out to Non, who has made every visit a true pleasure, thank you :)  The prices are fair, depending on how hungry you are $75 can feed 4 people (regular hunger) or 2 people (Big Bear hunger!!!) with soup and drinks and tip included.  Food to try: Rolls: Aburi Salmon, Zesty Avalanche, Meteor Rain, Tropic Rush, 911, Mount Alaska Combo: Spicy Catch Combo Soup: Orignal or Spicy Miso Beverages: Green tea and this really funky soda that has a neat bottle with a glass ball that carbonates the drink... tastes like cream soda.  I would recommend Big Catch to anyone for dine in or takeout, and have enjoyed meals there with my partner, our friends and family.    I feel like I'm gushing now, so I'll end the review!"}
{"text":"This place is soooooo delicious! The wait times during the weekend can be long but soooo worth it and the guys working are busting their behinds!!!!!  The sashimi is sooo fresh and the rolls are wicked aweseome--- perfect size, not too much rice and super fresh!!!!!! LOVES IT!!!!"}
{"text":"I always looked this place over whenever I made my way down Kingsland Farmers Market for lunch. It's easy to be that oblivious given there's a dozen great places to eat there. But I was stuck with the task of planning our next work lunch, paid for by the company (SWAAAAAAGEEERRRRR).  I was FED up with Coco brooks and SWASS Chalet so I decided to grab one of Big Catch's menus. It had a small selection and had reasonably cheap prices. Average rolls were about 6-14.  Ordering was a breeze. They were the friendliest folks both on and off the phone.   For the price we paid I was worried this would be a run-of-the-mill experience comparable to Safeway and superstore. But WOW...probably the best take-out sushi I've had in this city. I stake my flimsy reputation on that statement.  And to be honest, a lot of my fav sushi joints can't even get this part of their business right (no love lost though, we all can't play the guitar and the banjo)  I got the Spicy catch combo which were three different rolls that came with a special sauce. It wasn't spicy as I thought it would be, but the savory and sweet sauce was incredible. Maybe there was a mix-up in our hefty order, but it was a serendipitous mix-up I'll never regret. The sushi was well-formed and the rice was cooked to consistency. The fish was fresh but I would like to take a stab at their sashimi and sushi someday. Oh and they make those pretty daikon radish flowerettes.  p.s.   What is wrong with you Yelp Calgary? Why haven't you caught on to Big Catch yet? WHY?"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Rodeo Rider specialty roll. The roll has plenty of fresh tuna and salmon, mixed in with little tempura pieces. Crispy garlic chips, green onions and sesame seeds were sprinkled on top of the roll. With a dab of the special sauce, there was no need for soy sauce. I also tried the maki combo meal, which consisted of a Dynamite roll, a California roll and a Spicy Tuna roll. I noticed that Big Catch was generous with the amount of fish in the rolls. For example, the Spicy Tuna roll contained a nice thick piece of tuna.The Spicy Tuna roll was actually more sweet than spicy. I think the next time, I'll ask for just a regular tuna roll. The tuna was so fresh, it didn't need anything but a dab of wasabi and a splash of high sodium soy sauce. I don't usually enjoy California rolls, but Big Catch's version was very nice, the crab was fluffy with just a hint of sweetness. My boyfriend's favourite was the Dynamite Roll, which contained a slice of avocado, cucumber matchsticks, a smear of tiny, bright orange tobiko, and a sweet, still warm tempura prawn.We both loved the rice in the rolls. Each grain was perfectly formed. You could tell just by taking a whiff of the rice that it has the perfect balance of vinegar and sugar. The nori was good too, it wasn't chewy at all."}
{"text":"Really awesome sushi and really great service! Probably some of the best sushi I've had in the city."}
{"text":"The big catch is the best sushi in calgary. There, that's done.  Somehow their sashimi is fresher and fresher every time I eat there (which is quite often.) they are true artists as well, and the presentation is so delightful that it makes a lunch out an enriching experience. The young fellow at the register (whose name I can t remember) is so nice and always has a smile and is so thoughtful and considerate that he brightens my day. But it really comes down to the Toro. It will transport you to a special place."}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited Big Catch today inside Market on MacLeod, first time and my first impression is that the taste, texture and presentation of the dishes we ordered were excellent. We were quite impressed, not only with the quality of the food but also of the service. I didn't expect them to bring out our dishes and also take them away as we finished eating, perhaps it helped that we were sitting right across from them but kudos to them being quite observant even though they were quite busy when we ordered.  We placed our order and we were given a buzzer/pager and we took a seat; we only waited roughly 5-7 minutes while we strolled casually at the adjacent produce market and patiently anticipated our page to buzz.  We ordered gyoza, the Dragon roll, Dynamite roll and California roll. We were pleased with all of them. What I've noticed was that the different flavors from the ingredients in each of the rolls were distinct, fresh and delicious!  I'm definitely going to recommend this sushi bar to my sister and her family; I will definitely be back to try the other items in their menu.  Keep it up Big Catch, good job!"}
{"text":"I  can't believe how awesome this sushi is. Seriously. Not only is it presented beautifully all the time, but it is ALWAYS so FRESH and delicious. The unagi is some of the best I've ever had. (and I eat sushi A LOT) IIt is also a very good value for the price. I've been to \"fancy\" sushi places that don't do it even half as good as these guys and for twice the price. Try the passion sunrise roll (crab, avocado, topped with salmon, tobiko and a yummy sauce) too -- so good!   Great for take-out or grab a plate and sit and do some people watching at the farmer's market. So so good. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. :)"}
{"text":"Big Catch was such a great find for us. We have tried sushi all over Calgary and it is generally okay and often overpriced. Big Catch in my opinion is leading the way in the Calgary sushi scene with very high quality sushi prepared with incredible detail at very reasonable prices. They also seem to always have toro in stock which makes me very happy. I can't tell you how many places in Calgary are always sold out of tuna belly!   I generally like having a beer with sushi so we almost exclusively do take away (no license at the Farmer's Market... yet!). We pretty much place an order every weekend or so. I hope they decide to open up a licensed place some day. They are masters at what they do so they will be successful no matter where they end up.   When you serve amazing food, people will always find you!"}
{"text":"Really great sushi for the price. Service was awesome too, the guy really took his time to make recommendations according to what we liked.   It seems like they mostly focus on rolls as most of their menu covers the various rolls they offer. However, we ordered some sashimi on the side too and it was fresh and tasted great. Would totally recommend. The miso soup was really good too.   The presentation of the food is great and I thought it was kind of funny that we were eating off of a gigantic plate. The food all tastes as good as they look though so don't worry :D  I have to point out that the hours of operation are kinda wonky, and they do make everything once ordered so it takes them some time, especially if they are busy. I believe you can call to order take out/pick up. We spent our time walking around the farmer's market as they give you a buzzer for when your food is ready. Wouldn't recommend as a place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Big Catch has delicious and fresh sushi.  I love their sushi so much that I can't go anywhere else anymore.  The presentation is beautiful and the guys are so friendly!  They know my name and remember what I tend to order.  I go to the market every week to eat their sushi as well as get my weekly supply of groceries.  Go!  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Really good and authentic sushi. The guy at the counter is extremely friendly.  We ordered the 911, Alaskan and ten pieces of sashimi. They tasted awesome. Super fresh and had a good combination of flavours.  Their plating is also very creative, they made a dragon using wasabi! Wow!"}
{"text":"I am new to Calgary, but having lived in Vancouver for more than three years spoiled me in terms of quality of sushi joints. The first place I tried upon my arrival was Kinjo and it was horrendous (again, I am spoiled). All farmed fish and a lot of mayo-based sauces and deep-fried stuff. Takes the healthy nature of sushi completely out of the equation. After that bad experience I kept looking around Yelp, specifically for places that have wild salmon and ta-daaa I found Big Catch. It's not easy to spot if you're driving around because it's inside a little market, but it is right at the entrance. I ordered wild salmon sashimi and a custom wild salmon-avocado roll, miso soup, and green tea. Everything was great, as good as Vancouver sushi. The only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is because they charge extra for green tea and it's not pre-brewed (they did it like Starbucks - what???), they don't have the spicy powder I like on my miso, and the bill was pretty high for a one-person sushi meal ($18). Highly recommended just for the quality of the food. Will definitely come back but will NOT be ordering tea again! ;)"}
{"text":"I had my best sushi experience here in Calgary. So fresh and delicious. The chef is so warm and friendly. It was a cosy place but the style of serving, the quality of food, and the hospitality was 5 stars. I strongly recommend this place. I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"From the Seattle, WA area so definitely spoiled with amazing sushi and sashimi and was craving some good sushi after a few days visiting Calgary. Was a little hesitant and ready to be a bit disappointed with any sushi we tried but this was definitely not a disappointment in any way. Excellent quality, beautiful presentation and very creative rolls.  A great find and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The best sushi in town! Its sashimi is so fresh and it melts in your mouth! Their sushi rice is always consistent. Its sushi presentation is very beautiful. Very artistic! I haven't had a same presentation so far. Service? Superior! :)"}
{"text":"It was a bit tough for me to go to Big Catch because of the Kingsland Farmers' Market is only open between 9-5 pm. If you want to try it, it might be a good idea to come for lunch. I stopped by on a whim on a late afternoon and I was surprised to find the market open so I ventured inside.   Big Catch is good, the staff is very friendly and the food is priced very reasonably for sushi. There is a good variety of creative rolls. You can tell it's a small start-up and the staff really appreciate your business.   Being in the food court of a Farmer's Market, there are many things around it to supplement to experience, try the juicer in the market if you want something to quench your thirst.  I would go again if I'm in the vicinity, though I'm not sure if the market will always be open when I'm around."}
{"text":"A great value for good sushi. Fish is very fresh and portions are perfect. The service is friendly and efficient. I love that they use white ginger! I always get the big catch combo plus an unagi roll. Yum! Take out is super awesome and always made fresh to order. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Non, our Big Catch server, explained to us that Big Catch sushi-grade fish comes flash frozen from Russia, BC and Norway. He started us on a frequents big catch card, and helped us to order the dinner extravaganza we desired.   We ordered spicy tuna roll, dynamite roll, spicy salmon roll, rodeo rider roll and Rainbow roll. We also tried The weekly special, teriyaki chicken wings for 4.95. We got two wings. They were good, crispy, fall off the bone, with a nice Brush of teriyaki sauce and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. It came with a tzatziki  sauce, delicious. But after thinking about it we got two wings for $2.50 each. Worth it? Not really. But the food was good, so we forgave.  My gracious dinner date didn't enjoy the sauce on the spicy tuna and salmon rolls but we both thought the rodeo rider roll was the best, sauce and all. We got enough wasabi, which I thought was fantastic. The ginger and wasabi was also soft and fresh.  The presentation was beautiful. The rice, perfectly done. The fish was fresh. Just so you know, I am a sushi connoisseur. I have been eating sushi since I was five years old and this is good sushi for Calgary. We got great service and I highly recommend the fresh gracious quality Big Catch gives patrons."}
{"text":"Unexpected freshness from a \"food court\" stand... albeit it was at the farmers market. The sushi here was quite delicious! My fellow yelper and I decided to try this out because a mutual friend of ours recommended it. The rolls were crafted thinking of complimentary flavours.   We ordered the special platter (quite gluttonous for 2 people), which was adorned with 6 rolls: passion sunrise, rodeo rider, tropic rush, zesty avalanche, meteor rain, and 9-1-1. One of my favourites was the meteor rain as it was spicy and was topped with torched seared salmon, being filled with crabmeat and salmon. Runner up was the rodeo rider filled with tuna and salmon, but the highlight was the spicy sauce and GARLIC CHIPS! Such great dimension of flavour in this one. Third place was 9-1-1 as the heat this one packed was spot on. Tuna and crunchy wonton bits topped with salmon, fire sauce, tobiko, and cayenne pepper really brings all the flavour and texture to the bite.  Definitely worth the visit, but bring more people so you can both try more rolls and not feel like you're going to burst at the end."}
{"text":"After reading the numerous 5 star reviews for Big Catch, we got really excited to try their sushi. So we decided to go there for our anniversary lunch \"food crawl\".    So for our first time eating there we ordered their Big Catch combo( 6 piece dynamite roll, 6 piece picy tuna roll, and 6 piece California roll) and the Jupiter roll. All of the rolls tasted great and the food presentation was beautiful! Much better than most full fledge restaurants. The service was amazing and personable. The whole experience just blew us away.  We wished we went to Big Catch last cause after our anniversary \"food crawl\" we felt that we started with the best part of our crawl(Big Catch) and we probably should have ended there! I have decided that Big Catch is this little gem of sushi paradise in the small Market on MacLeod.  Definitely recommend it to friends and family. Already looking forward to coming back soon and bringing the rest of our family with us."}
{"text":"This gem is in the Market on MacLeod around 76th ave and is my go to place for sushi in Calgary! You may want to note that this is a stall in the market, not a sit down restaurant, but there are tables and chairs to sit down an eat. It has more of a bustling atmosphere, not trendy or romantic.   The menu is not huge but there's still plenty of rolls to choose from, with their special rolls being far more creative and delicious than I've had at other places. Its Japanese run with very friendly staff and they also carry stamp cards.   Very fresh fish and seafood, good sushi rice, stupidly tasty flavour combinations, and very nice presentation when you eat in.... sometimes when I get takeout too!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Super impressed with this place! For a small spot at the farmers market, this place has some serious flavour and freshness for sushi. Everything on the menu looked amazing and it was really hard to narrow it down as I was a solo diner that afternoon. I will definitely be bringing back more people so I can sample more items. I decided on the rodeo rider roll (based on the recommendations from other yelpers), the autumn haze roll, which was a new edition, as well as salmon sashimi. First and foremost, I want to say that the presentation of the sushi is beautifully done, complete with gorgeous geode plate. The sushi also was absolutely delicious. I loved the subtle spice and crunch from the garlic chips from the rodeo rider roll, I really recommend that one if its your first time. The salmon sashimi also tasted really fresh. Another bonus is that they have brown rice as an option for no extra charge!   They have lots of combos and platters, so this is an excellent place for take out sushi. I can't wait to come back for more! The only downside of this place is their hours as they are only open during the farmers market."}
{"text":"I had heard good things from @maggiem about The Big Catch, so I had to go and check it out for myself!  Went with @paulp and ordered the Special Platter.  This platter feeds 3 people but we were hungry and did the classic over-order!    The Special Platter includes: 1 Passion Sunrise, 1 Rodeo Rider, 1 Tropic Rush, 1 Zesty Avalanche, 1 Meteor Rain, 1 Nine One One.  All were fresh and had a great combination of flavors.  The presentation was also amazing, nicer than most sit down sushi restaurants that I've been to.    I wish we were able to try the Chicago roll too, but we were stuffed.  We had 7 pieces left over...but in reality, we should have had more, because we were eating well after we were full in efforts not to waste our order!  So again, 3 people could easily share this platter and splitting the cost between 3 people makes it very affordable for the quality and amount of sushi you get.  Take note that it is a kiosk inside Market On McLeod, so its not a \"restaurant,\" but don't let that stop you from checking out this place if you love sushi.  I will definitely be back to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the sushi 4 stars for the service 2 & a half stars for the value 1 & a half stars for location  The best sushi in Calgary? I see that several times in the reviews here.  ...kinda makes me glad I haven't craved sushi too often in Calgary.  Don't get me wrong, I like Big Catch, and bought lunch here several times, as I worked close by. But it's a take-out joint, people, serving very standard fare of rather good quality - at fairly premium prices, considering that there's no restaurant or decor or even seating provided.  If you're in the neighborhood you should check them out, but this is no destination for foodies seeking excellence."}
