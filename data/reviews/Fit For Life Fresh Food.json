{"text":"Pleasent staff, delicious Shaowerma, average price, Halal food. The Shaowerma sandwich taste good and delicious, the only thing I didn't like is the Egyptian bread used to do the sandwich!"}
{"text":"So I was at the Erin Mills and walking around hangry so I thought to myself why not go to the food court. I got there and looked at my choices; plenty to choose from, but I wanted meat in my meal as well. I looked around and saw 2 halal places, one was a pizza place who had a halal label on and then I saw this place.  I talked to to the owner and he stated everything is halal and he was a Muslim brother. He was very friendly and asked us for the choices. it gave a feel of mom and pop shop within a mall as his wife was working with him.  I looked at my choices and we went with a Shawarma plate and a Steak plate. The quantity were good and the plate came with rice, salad and the choice of the meat. He was not stingy on the sauces which I like. For rice there was choice of plain or with lentil. The meat was fresh and didn't smell plus the quality of the piece of meat was good. Both the Shawarma and Steak spices were great any tasty.   Overall, this was a very good experience and he gets an extra star for caring service.   For my Muslim folks - the place has halal signs and the owner confirmed everything to be halal"}
{"text":"Love the different selections. Love they have a card and stamp promotion. Chicken shawarma dinner is the best!"}
{"text":"This was always my \"go-to\" when I used to work around the mall eons ago. So it was a no brainer to choose Fit for Life -- I love a fast lunch that's still healthy yet fresh. Opted for the Pepper Steak on Basmati Rice Signature Box but when the lone lady at the counter had to turn around to glance at the sign to check and recheck what goes in the dish, I started to worry about my choice of establishment.  All in all it was a pretty satisfying meal except for the fact that it WASN'T fluffy Basmati Rice but some other type of white long grain rice that looked par boiled. If not for that major oversight, I'd have given it 4 stars. Oh yeah, and the fact that the lady only greeted me with barely an audible \"hello\" AFTER I greeted her first."}
{"text":"Very nice food and very pleasant owner. I had one of the best Falafel Panini at this place. Highly recommended. I can switch from Subway anytime for this food."}
{"text":"I randomly ended up going here purely based off the name of this establishment. \"Fit for Life\", I exclaimed to the short little lady behind the counter that I too wished to be fit for life and to proceed by giving me the largest chicken dinner platter they had.  The meal was reasonably priced at around 13 bucks with a bottle of water.  Food was really good though! I'd recommend trying them out! Will be going back."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful falafel in a pita sandwich at this location this weekend. Perfect original combo. Falafel had just the right seasoning and veggies were fresh. I recommend stopping by anytime you are in the area. Beats other local chain by far on the same sandwhich. ;)"}
{"text":"I was really pleased with the service and tasty food. A more \"real food\" experience at the Erinmills Towncentre Mall...when you get tired of the fast food and are looking for something more healthy, this is a good choice."}
