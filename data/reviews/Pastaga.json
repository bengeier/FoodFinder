{"text":"Cher Pastaga, mais que t'est- il arrivé?! 
Un samedi, à l'heure du brunch, l'endroit est vide. Tellement vide que je me suis décidé à appeler pour m'assurer que tu étais ouvert.
Un endroit qui, toutes les fois où j'y suis allé, était plein à craquer, se retrouve épuré. 
Bref, je m'assois confiant et déterminé à déguster les meilleurs oeufs bénédictine, à ma connaissance. 

Cuits à une temperature exacte de 63 degrés ils ont la consistance parfaite. Je commande avec confiance le plat qui a fait de moi un grand fan, mais l'assiette qui se trouve devant moi m'est inconnue.. Un toast avec des oeufs bénédictines et quelques feuilles de pousses provenant probablement d'un balcon à l'arrière (pi c ben correct), l'assiette est d'une sobriété ennuyeuse et limite spartiate... BOF, me voilà déçu... C'est plus comme avant.. 

J'essaie de rattraper le coup avec des pâtisseries et desserts. MIAM! Enfin, la magie opère à nouveau. Les desserts offrent un peu plus de fantaisie autant pour les yeux que pour le goût. J'ai pris le chausson aux pêches et le pancake (je tiens à preciser que je n'étais pas seul, je ne suis pas gourmant à ce point). 
Bref, les desserts et service étant bons, ça va,  pas trop de regrets. 

Je redonnerais une autre chance à Pastaga, un jour, car je le sais capable de surprendre et de rassembler autour de plats aussi plaisants les uns que les autres"}
{"text":"I went to Pastaga for their weekend brunch. It was all quite good. The waiter brought us delicious butter/white chocolate cookies as an appetizer bite. They were fantastic. The drinks were very average. The baked beans in my \"ham and beans\" dish were good but the ham was very dry and bland and this is where I remove a star. My dining partners had the pulled pork benny which was very tasty, and the mushrooms on toast which was also quite good. The presentations were all very pretty. I asked the waiter how big the side of chopped liver (6$) was and he said small so we ordered 2, turns out they were pretty big and could've easily shared it since it was only a side. It was served on toast, covered in pickled onions and was quite good. The service was ok. I will come again and give it a shot for dinner. Oh- and decor and atmosphere is fantastic."}
{"text":"Un restaurant de qualité, où nous avions l'habitude d'apprécier des plats orignaux et une carte des vins riche. C'était certainement un de nos restaurants préférés et nous avions l'habitude d'y aller régulièrement. Malheureusement, nos deux dernières visites nous ont convaincus que l'endroit se laisse aller. Le service notamment laisse de plus en plus à désirer, tandis que les plats sont moins soignés qu'ils ne l'étaient. Sans parler de la carte qui change peu depuis les deux dernières années... Au final, un gout un peu amer après ce repas, qui sera à coup sûr le dernier, où la qualité des plats n'était plus au rendez-vous, sans parler de l'accueil chaleureux et des petits soins portés aux clients qui ont complètement disparu... Quel dommage !"}
{"text":"Don't be misled by the name, you won't find carbonara or lasagna on the menu at Pastaga. In place, you'll discover an inspired selection of dishes with a distinctly Quebecois flavour. With original and tasty food, a warm relaxed vibe and impeccable service, Pastaga raised the bar on all fronts and left me with a great impression.

We had a selection of tapas including Salmon & potato salad, Shrimp ceviche, Lacquered pork belly, chopped liver, black inked squid, and deer tartare, as well as 2 delicious deserts. 

Check it all out with my full review here:

{"text":"One of the best hidden gems of Montreal. A little off the beaten path but only a short cab ride from the plateau. One of the best food experiences in years."}
{"text":"Had an excellent evening at this quaint neighborhood restaurant. Every element of the evening, from the greeting upon our arrival to our departure, we enjoyed a lovely evening. Kevin was a great host for this group of English speakers - recommending dishes and wines throughout our dinner. The octopus, foie gras, and potine were are starting dishes, followed by the maple glazed pork, Atlantic salmon w/ salmon jerky, butter fish (special) were all excellent and it was hard to pick the favorite. Finishing the evening off with an aperitif and the apple tart rounded the night out perfectly. This will be a must return next time I'm in Montreal. Thanks for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience. The food was unreal and I enjoyed every dish we tried. Our waiters reccomendation were thorough and very helpful. Hopefully can go back again"}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week and all the items we had are part of their regular menu. The atmosphere was laid-back and nice, with a relatively comfortable distance between tables. The salmon appetizer was super fresh and interesting, but everything else we had was just a tad disappointing. 

It's been my personal mission to try risotto everywhere that I can, and am sad to say that it wasn't great here. It was overcooked, and did not taste tongue-burningly-hot as it should if it was made fresh just for me. We also had the dessert (chocolate mousse), which was almost great except the \"sponge taffy\" was essentially chunks of brown sugar and unappealing after the initial sugar rush wore off. 

Unfortunately, while the price point was just right for restaurant week, I don't think most of the things we ordered would feel \"worth\" their prices on the regular menu and we're unlikely to go back."}
{"text":"J'avais entendu parler de ce resto en grand bien. Je l'ai essayé à l'improviste pour un brunch avec ma fille. Accueil correcte. Nous avons attendu longtemps pour un grille cheeze et un oeuf Bénédicte et le resto n'était  même  pas plein! Mon assiette est arrivée  tiède  et le blanc d'oeuf était  vraiment trop  baveux. J'ai donc du attendre encore pour qu'on me refasse une autre assiette. Dison que pour une première  fois c'était pas convaincant."}
{"text":"Ce fut notre première expérience au Pastaga et surement pas notre dernière.
Le service était amical et sans prétentieux et tous les plats que nous avions pris étaient bien réussis (tartare de thon, longe de veau, poitrine de porcelet, saumon mariné). 

Il faut savoir que les portions sont petites et qu'il faut commander au moins deux plats (15-25$/plat) par personne pour être rassasié."}
{"text":"We tired quickly of the bite-sized portions, however carefully prepared, and decamped to another restaurant, as we were starving, and after eating for an hour and having spent $150 between the three of us, we were still starving and dreaming of where to go next.  The waitress advised us to order 5 dishes per 2 people, which translated to 7-8 for 3 people.  The blood pudding pie, was delicious, however $17 only gave us a narrow slice.  The pork sous-vide lacked flavour and moisture, and we couldn't find snything nice to say sbout it.  The crab slaw was delicious but the serving was smaller than a loosely packed ice-cream scoop.  I think they use really small spoons to plate the dishes.  Unfortunately, that's all i remember--blood pudding pie and being hungry.  We would have needed about $150-$200 per person to have enough bites, and we were all size 2-4 women!  Nice-looking restaurant, polished and knowledgeable service if a bit cold (maybe we were hungry), clean washrooms, and it got pretty busy and loud at 9 pm with a young professional crowd and a few babies.  I wouldn't have minded paying $200+, but I was too hungry and was afraid it would take $400 pp to be sated."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée cette semaine avec mon chum. Premièrement la place est vraiment bien. Lumineux, aéré et le décor donne envie de relaxer. 
On peut voir ce qui se passe dans la cuisine, cela peut être divertissant. Nous avons été reçu rapidement et amicalement. On nous a expliqué le menu. 
Il est suggéré de faire un choix de plat froid et un plat chaud car il semble que les portions sont petites. Mon plat était le porcelet laqué. Waou ! ! Délicieux mon chum avait pris la pieuvre et boom ! Super bon.
Le dessert de mousse une merveille!! Un petit bémols pour la tarte à la rhubarbe vraiment acide à mon goût et la petite crème glacée au gingembre pas dans mes cordes. Dans l'ensemble très bien. Je recommande. Pour moi le seul bémol est le prix, tsé quand tu paies un plat à 19.75$ pis tu l'as fini les larmes aux yeux pcq ct trop bon mais que t'es pas rassasié....c un pas cool.
Vous me diriez si t'as pas les moyens d'aller aux resto vas y pas. C'est vrai c une question de budget perso. Mais quand même. C un peu cher ou trop petite portion. 

J'y retournerai c sure!"}
{"text":"what an amazing experience!
the tables are quite original, carved out of wood, you feel like you're having champagne on a tree trunk! :)
the food is absolutely delicious! every single item on the menu is great.
I went with our waiter's recommendation and had the Salmon entree followed by the Pork & pancake main dish... both were plate licking good!
I actually managed to squeeze in a dessert as well. I chose the Apple tartine. with crushed bretzels & nuts icecream... WOW! 

My friend had the white tuna as an entree and the veal as main course, followed by the chocolate mousse for dessert! All great choices for her as well!

The waiter was super friendly and suggested amazing cocktails to accompany our meals! perfect match!

Make sure to reserve in advance, the place is not very big and they are always quickly booked."}
{"text":"How many times can you say that everything you ate at a meal was wonderful, and you wouldn't change a thing? It's hard to even pick the highlights of our meal at Pastaga, because each dish was so interesting and enjoyable.... And the wine - we asked for a recommendation of a medium-bodied red on the lower half of the price range. The sommelier brought us a wine that fit the bill but was so much more as well, and presented it to us in a friendly and unpretentious manner. The whole staff was friendly and unpretentious, for that matter, switching effortlessly to English since some in our party were less than comfortable in French. The dining areas were intimate and convivial, but spacious enough that you felt that your table had its own space. I suppose that the only advice I'd include for those with larger appetites is that the plates are all delectable, small plates - even light eaters should plan to order 2 per person. But enjoy... since the carte is fairly small, I am sure that the chef must change it fairly regularly, which in my opinion means that there will be new delights in store!"}
{"text":"Une des meilleure expérience culinaire que j'ai vécue à Montréal! Compte tenu de la qualité, l'endroit reste tout de même abordable puisqu'on y mange mieux qu'à certains restaurants qui sont facilement le double du prix...

Menu raffiné, staff fantastique, informés, connaisseurs, sympathique... Toute la soirée a été une grande réussite.

Nous étions un groupe d'amis et la plupart se sont laissés tentés par le menu dégustation avec accord de vins et ce fut une excellente décision! Tout le monde n'avait que de bons mots à dire sur leur plat et j'étais tout de même avec une clientèle assez difficile...

Au final, c'est à essayer absolument et bien sûr à y retourner..."}
{"text":"La décoration du restaurant et l'énorme cuisine vitrée est superbe. 

Le service est impeccable, tous les serveurs nous donnaient des conseils sur les plats et le vin, de vrais passionnés. 

La nourriture était extraordinaire. Le tataki de thon était à tomber de sa chaise. Super restaurant que je recommande pour une soirée en amoureux ou en amis."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. There are so many new incredible restaurants in Montreal - it's actually hard to keep up. I love it. I do believe that the city's nightlife scene could use the same kind of facelift...

Today, I'm raving about Pastaga - a new restaurant that opened just a couple months ago on St-Laurent Boulevard below Little Italy. Don't be fooled - it's not Italian. \"Pastaga\" is actually another name for Pastis, the French anise-flavored alcohol enjoyed as an apéritif. Accordingly, restaurant puts a modern twist on French-bistro cuisine and décor. 

What's the deal? Small plates (2-3/person for a full meal) and a focus on biodynamic wine (without headache-prompting tannins). A chill, unpretentious atmosphere. Delicious food delivered by fun waiters. A table in the kitchen that invites diners to watch \"the game\", all while keeping the dinner crowd happy and unaware of the TV. And Twin Shadow as background music? Pastaga definitely wins when it comes to first impressions.

First, my friend and I tried the crispy yellow pike with pumpkin purée and rapini salad. Delightful. The fish was delicate, flaky, and cooked to the perfect point. The pumpkin purée and the rapini added some sweet-smooth and bitter-crunchy flavour and texture.

Next, we had the waffle with sautéed wild mushrooms, greens, and slivers of Parmesan. Again, yum! It's nouveau - mother country gone new world, shall we say - and it works.

Our third dish was the bison - a mini steak atop pulled meat, shredded parsnips and a slightly BBQ'd-style sauce. Another hit. Especially the pulled bison. For me it was a first, and certainly not a last.

Finally, have you heard of their piglet belly lacquered with brown sugar placed atop a parsnip pancake? If not, be forewarned. This won't stay a secret for long. It was insane! Divine. It melted in my mouth. And with that pancake? Whoa boy. Whoaaaaa boy.

Just in case Pastaga hadn't wowed us enough already, the restaurant seriously \"brought it\" with dessert. Per the waiter's suggestion, we ordered the little begnets (mini donut \"balls\") filled with apple sauce accompanied by two oval \"scoops\" of vanilla ice-cream, little dollops of caramel cream, baked apple \"chips\", pieces of sautéed apple and apple butter. Again, amazing. And a portion big enough for two.

Pastaga has been getting some well-deserved buzz lately, and you definitely want in on the action. Book ahead and don't tell your friends. (Just kidding.)

{"text":"This is by far the best Canadian restaurant I've had the pleasure to dine at, and I'm amazed how little it is known in Montreal.

The restaurant itself stands out from others with its big, clear windows. The entire dining place is lit with several lightbulbs attached directly to extension cables hanging on the ceiling, and the ambience is slightly more \"hipster\" and casual.

The tables are in different sizes and shapes, and I was seated at a table that was very wide in width but pretty narrow in length, and for my table most of the dishes were presented in long, rectangular plates. The same dish, however, ordered by another table of 2 beside me was presented in a round, large plate because they had more table space. The plating, of course, was also slightly different.
It amazes me how much thought process they invested for creating such magnificent dining experience for every individual.

The service was quick, efficient and personal, and there is nothing much to talk about. It is possible to make and modify your reservation online via Guestful, and it is very fast and convenient.

The food was savoury at every bite. Pastaga's dishes were, in my opinion, about the harmony of flavours and textures. Every element on the plate has its own purpose, whether it was the acidity from pickled eggplant to balance the sweetness of the caramel sauce, or the texture of the soft pancake to contrast the crispiness of the piglet skin, everything just works so well...together!

From the interior decor to the presentation of the dishes, everything seemed so simple, and yet so elegant and complex. Chef Juneau has showed me that simplicity is indeed the new complexity."}
{"text":"Savoureux, original et créatif.
Repas en amoureux ou nous avons passé une très belle soirée chez Pastaga.

Des plats savoureux, pieuvre, porcelet, Poutine et burrata avec mille feuille et gâteau au chocolat en dessert. Des plats plein de saveurs le tout appuyé par un service attentionné et efficace.

Envie d'y retourner pour goûter à d'autres plats. Cadre et ambiance chaleureuse !"}
{"text":"I won't know the exact names of the menu items, as they were in French; however, I can say that the food was exquisite (as was the company, though I cannot promise they will sit with you when you are there). We went to Pastaga on an empty night (thank you, snow storm). I don't remember the wine that was ordered, but I do remember a delicious cocktail with a silly name (what was that name?) and it was very tasty.
For the dinner, I ordered the beet salad (OMG) and the scallop dish. They were both to die for. My partner had the salmon dish as a starter and I wanted to steal it from him. I can't remember what he ordered for the main (check Tripadvisor as he does not Yelp - sorry!).  The service was impeccable and the snow outside glittered as if it was lit by tiny little fiber-optic lights (or diamonds if you want to go that direction). That being said, I cannot promise you will be there when everyone else cancels their reservations and the snow sparkles as if lit from within. What I can say is that the food is worth the reservation, even without the delightful company I enjoyed.
If this is what Quebec is to food, then Quebec deserves to be on the food map as much as New York and Paris do.
Surprisingly, the prices weren't even as steep as one would expect in the U.S. for food of this quality. Amazing."}
{"text":"Came here with coworkers and we got to sit inside the kitchen where the action is. The food was awesome and delicious. We had a table d'hôte with 5 services. The appetizer consisted of small bites of different meat such as deer tartare. It was very fresh. As a meal, the salmon and the octopus were great and very tender. For the dessert, I had a chocolate mousse/pudding? Wasn't very impressed as it wasn't something extraordinary but it was still delicious. 

As for the service, it was quick to get our food even though we were a group of 10 and the staff is very friendly. Maybe next time I would prefer to sit outside in the dining room as it can be very noisy inside the kitchen. Overall, the food is excellent and the experience was awesome. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Ouf. Oh lala. Les mots me manquent pour décrire ma toute première (oui, je sais, c'est gênant) expérience au Pastaga, le réputé resto du chef Martin Juneau, celui qui est aussi derrière le foodtruck Mr. Crémeux et le nouveau pub british Sir Joseph.

J'ai mangé en cuisine, l'énergie était merveilleuse. J'ai eu un service A1, des conseils et des descriptions à s'en lécher les babines. 

On a débuté par le plat signature, le saumon mariné avec pommes de terres crémeuses et du saumon jerky fait sur place râpé sur le dessus : un régal. Mais c'est les pétoncles qui ont été mon véritable coup de coeur de la soirée, avec la purée d'échalottes, les oignons perlés caramélisés et les champignons (pied-de-mouton et girolles). 

On poursuit avec la longe de veau cuit à la perfection et fondant en bouche, qui m'avait attiré pour ses accompagnements : pesto qui goûte le parmesan à fond, et les bahjis d'oignons. Finalement, on se régale avec le pogo de lapin de Stanstead et le boudin noir qui me rappelle le pain d'épices.

On accompagne les viandes avec un vin nature rouge, qui me fait oublier mes mauvaises expériences antérieures avec le produit. 

Bref, ça faisait trop longtemps que je n'avais pas aussi bien manger, sans parler de l'expérience complète grâce à la table en cuisine et des discussions avec les serveurs et le sommelier!"}
{"text":"Pour un restaurant de cette qualité, je m'attendais à payer beaucoup plus cher. Les plats sont franchement abordables. Une belle surprise

L'ambiance est décontractée, le service est excellent. Côté plat, j'ai commandé la poitrine de porcelet laquée au sucre brun, pancake & marinade de panais et en dessert, la mousse chocolat amer brisures de tire éponge et foam caramel.

Il faut réserver, ca se remplit rapidement"}
{"text":"Oui. Mais non. Je m'explique :) Le décor est sobre et lumineux, le design des tables intéressant et le service souriant et relativement rapide, mais on arrête là pour les compliments.

Le menu comporte une sélection d'entrées et une autre de petits plats principaux. Les portions ne sont pas ridicules, mais pas grosses non plus, donc attention les gros mangeurs. C'est bon, c'est joliment présenté, sans plus.

La liste des vins, en revanche, est une vraie catastrophe. Ce sont des vins dits \"naturels\" qui goûtent le jus de fruit (nous avons essayé deux bouteilles différentes) et il n'y a aucune autre option. Aucune finesse, aucune richesse, ça ruine même le goût des plats. Je ne comprends pas ce choix de la part du chef, qui jouit pourtant d'une certaine réputation...

Ce n'est pas une place à éviter, mais si vous la mettez dans votre liste, ne la placez pas tout en haut :)"}
{"text":"Martin Juneau l'ancien chef de la Montée de Lait, revient ainsi avec un concept semblable mais qui marche tout aussi bien. Tant les plats que la carte de vin y est recherché et raffiné. On sent ici qu'on est dans un établissement de qualité, que la brigade est bien mené et que le service est important."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant and excellent service. The salmon gravlax is delicious, and they had two great specials the day we went in, one an asparagus and fiddleheads dish with a poached egg on top, and a grilled sea bream. Both were great. Hard to go wrong here."}
{"text":"Great service, cute decor, great selection of wines,food was just medium. Sort of overrated food, not sure what all the hype is about.

We ordered:

Shrimp salad on a baguette: great texture but lacked flavor, needed a lemon zest and some sea salt of some sort, a garnish would've been nice.

Fried cauliflower with watercress ( I think), crushed almonds and various Indian spices. Best dish of the four ordered, really enjoyed how all the ingredients complimented one another especially the mint.

Pork Belly, carrots and pancake: most disappointing dish, pork belly was well prepared but the carrot purée pancake was just awkward. I think I would've just preferred it being purée versus pancake form.

Venison, beets, crushed pistachios and apple infused sauce:

The venison was delicious so were the beets, the crushed pistachios were a nice touch. However, the apples made the dish too sweet.

Can't say I'd come back for dinner...maybe just for wine."}
{"text":"Location: On the main, close to the Little Italy 'border.' I don't think there's a subway stop close enough to walk from, but street parking is available. On weekends, the meters stop running at 6pm and if you arrive before 6, you should be able to find decent parking. I think the 55 bus runs all the way up as well. 

The place: Though the space is not huge by any means, it offers up a great layout with minimal decor and great lighting. It has a very 'clean' feel to it and is what I would consider very urban. I really like the space, as well as the great art work that adorns its walls. 

The food: This was my first stop on my MTL à Table extravaganza, and I was really eager to eat my way through Pastaga's menu! I started with the cream of butternut squash velouté with brown butter and ricotta ravioli. Considering I'd been out and about in the cold all day, soup was exactly what I needed to warm me up. It was delicious and you could really taste the nuttiness of the squash. The roasted pumpkin seeds added wonderful flavour to the soup, and the ravioli were both fresh and delicious. I couldn't really taste the ricotta, but truth be told, ricotta isn't bursting with flavour to begin with. In any case, I love this soup and would like to ask Martin Juneau to bottle it for me!

My main was the gorgeous grilled white tuna on a fried tortilla, accompanied by herb mayonnaise and a bouquet of veggies. I *think* the veggies included fennel but I'm not 100% certain. Either way, this dish was fantastic. The tuna was perfect, the tortilla wasn't oil or greasy at all, and the vegetables were fresh and crisp. After overindulging at Bremner on Friday, this was exactly what I needed to balance out the gluttony. I really loved this dish. My friend ordered the maple-lacquered pork belly with carrot pancake, which is Postage's signature dish, and she loved it. There was total silence while we ate our main dishes - I mean hello, there can be no interruptions when food is this good!

For dessert, we both ordered the chocolate and sponge toffee pot de crème. I honestly don't know which is better Chuck Hughe's pot or Martin Juneau's. I shed a few more tears as I enjoyed Pastaga's pot - it was divine!

Service: Very good. The wait staff was friendly even though they were very busy, our water was constantly refilled, our table was cleared after every dish, and our regular waiter took the time to explain the menu to us in detail. 

Price point: $29 for three courses during MTL à Table. You can't ask for better than that! I will definitely go back!

The only thing I found odd was that they only had French menus. Now, on my end, it's fine because I'm French. However, my American friend doesn't read French so she had to rely on me and the waiter to explain each dish to her. No big deal, but strange nonetheless. That said, I haven't seen their regular menu so can't say if it's bilingual or not. I would imagine that it probably is."}
{"text":"What a discovery! Dined with a dear friend visiting Montreal and was not disappointed. We each ordered 2 tasting dishes: pan-seared scallops, melt in your mouth pork belly, sturgeon,salmon, vennison & Bavarois with goat cheese.  I list them because each was a superb blend of delicate flavours, beautifully presented. Our Server was fantastic in guiding our choices and in pairing the perfect wine. Totally delectable! Fantastic service in a warm yet modern and lively, (but not too noisy)  environment. Superb! Can't wait to try their brunch!! Pastaga is a must."}
{"text":"Ce resto est vraiment digne d'un grand!
A l'arrivée, on se fait placer assez rapidement, même si c'est souvent plein ou presque
Il y a des tables près des cuisines, où l'on peut voir ce qui se passe en cuisine à travers les vitres
Nous étions sur une table en bois en hauteur, au milieu du resto, c'était très sympa
Nous y sommes allés pendant Montreal à table, le potage, le plat (porcelet laqué à l'érable) et le plateau de fromages étaient tous excellents
Le service était très bon aussi
Une réputation largement méritée, à essayer!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna go ahead and be perfectly honest and say that I don't remember much about this place. We went just after Xmas in 2012 and it's now August 2013. I know I had espresso and then another espresso, so the espresso muct have at least been passable. It was brutally cold out so I can say the heat works. And I went to the bathroom, so they have bathrooms. 

Oh we got breakfast there. I didn't even realize it was primarily an evening kinda place. How about that. 

Anyway, I don't remember what I got but I seem to remember it being good. D got some sort of eggs benedict concoction and it was good. I think it may have had salmon in it. I know it was tasty and at the end, there was no food left. The guy we met there also ate all his food. There's something to be said about that. 

So...heat, working bathrooms, good espresso, and food which will cause you to clean your plate. Sounds good to me. I say give it a shot and see what you think."}
{"text":"Une grande deception ce matin. Normalement les serveurs sont tres attentifs au besoins des végétariens mais à cause de la St Patricks il y avait seulement des plats de viande et pas d'options pour les non carnivores.  Malgré qu'un grilled cheese etait dispo sur le menu d'enfants le serveur nous a dit que ce n'etait pas valide pour le membre vegetarian de notre groupe. On s' attendait à plus de la part d'un resto aussi haut gamme."}
{"text":"We expected a lot and were seriously disappointed.
We ordered the nordic shrimps, the beet salad and the tuna belly with burrata over focaccia. 
The nordic shrimp plate was hands down the worst plate of food we ever ate in a restaurant.
The shrimp smelled (and tasted) terrible and were served with a (tasteless) cucumber gaspacho.
It's hard to understand how any chef could have served those shrimps to customers.
The beet salad and the tuna belly were okay. Certainly not the best we've had.
The staff was great, but seating was a bit awkward.
We've been looking forward to trying out Pastaga for a long time, but it was hard to enjoy the whole experience after those shrimps."}
{"text":"Il y a certains endroits qui rendent hommage à la bonne cuisine.Le pastaga en fait parti.Avec une carte épuré et qui change en fonction des produits de saisons , on voit ici que le chef cherche à respecter ses produits ,de première qualité .cest un de ces rare restaurant ou on peut commander les yeux fermés.les plats sont issus d'un processus réfléchis. Chaque éléments est savamment associé à d'autres pour aboutir à un équilibre parfait et une explosions de saveurs ,non sans rappeler certains souvenirs d'enfance( cf:sablés bretons aux fraises de Mr Legault et sa glace à l'estragon ) .Bref c'est une table qui invite au voyage et n'a rien a envié à certains étoilés européens."}
{"text":"Testé dans le cadre de Montréal à table, Pastaga m'a conquise immédiatement : placés dans les cuisines, on était aux premières loges pour voir les délicieuses assiettes prendre forme. Tout était délicieux, le service était parfait, et j'ai hate d'y retourner!"}
{"text":"The place is hidden on top of Marché des éclusiers, you can use the staircase of the left of the building or the one inside to get in. 
We were greated and seated immediately. 
Cute second floor terrace for a 5@7. It's a good spot for small groups or duos. As the name says, food is mostly snacks and small entrees. We shared oysters (very fresh, served with lemon slices and special hot sauce) as well as the Terre plate to share (3 different breads, olives, sweet potato and red pepper dip, 2 different cold cuts and pork rillette). The wine pairing suggested was great (organic white wine). It's a little bit on the pricey side but it's worth it once in a while. 
."}
{"text":"Pastaga! It's been on my to-go list forever, and I'm very glad I finally got to try it out. I went for lunch, which is offered only once a week on Fridays.

Tried
Appetizer
Chopped liver à la mousse d'onion, chips de bagel + onions marinés (+3)
\"Tataki\" de saumon de l'Atlantique, rattes crémeuses + salmon jerky râpé (+4)
Main
Pieuvre grillée à l'encre de seiche, gâteau de pdt + rouille safranée (17)
Tortellini de ris de veau (18)

Onward to each dish, which were beautifully plated.
The chopped liver was the best part of the meal for me, as the different tastes came together oh-so-perfectly onto one bite of the bagel. The liver, served in a mousse, came in a generous portion surrounded with a selection of greens mixed in with the marinated onions. Simply divine.

The salmon came in big sashimi slices, covered with a creamy potato salad. I was looking forward to the salmon jerky bits, but they were sprinkled very thinly, used more as seasoning than actual part of the dish. This was very good, without much new.

The mains were disappointing in comparison to the appetizers. The grilled octopus dish lacked cohesion; the octopus didn't go particularly well with the potato cake or the rouille. The ink-like sauce was a dark black like I've never seen before, but it lacked flavour to complement the dish.

The tortellini filling is one of their in-house special (ris de veau seems to pop-up now and then on their menu) and was very good. Too much pasta to filling ratio to my liking. The little mushrooms didn't do much for me in terms of sides.

Overall, as they change their menu frequently, I would definitely see myself coming back to sample other items. One downside of the meal was the pervasive use of potatoes, which I am not a big fan of."}
{"text":"Depuis le temps que nous devions venir nous sommes finalement venus 

Le cadre est sympa, c'est épuré et on peut voir les personnes en cuisine si on se place au fond du restaurant. Assez cool mais on a préféré des banquettes et des fauteuils confortable à un autre endroit !

Au niveau des plats il faut savoir que la notion d'entrée et de plat n'existe pas vraiment. Les portions sont assez petites et il est conseillé de prendre plusieurs plats pour les partager.
On a choisi une entrée à partager. Du saumon mariné avec des rates et des herbes. Bon mais 3 morceaux pour 4 ca faisait pas beaucoup ...
Ensuite pour les plats j'ai pris le gigot d'agneau braisé mais avec seulement 2 petits morceaux de viande j'ai trouvé ça ridicule pour 20$ ... Autant la viande est bonne mais il faut en avoir plus dans l'assiette pour apprécier le plat ... 
Le foie froid était bon et en bonne quantité. La poitrine de porc laqué à l'érable aussi mais cela pouvait devenir un peu écurant sur la longue et gras.  
Au niveau des desserts la madeleine à la pistache était bonne bien que ne ressemblant pas du tout à une madeleine. J'ai aimé son gout de madeleine mais Laura l'a trouvé trop imbibé et n'a pas aimé sa forme :D 

Niveau vin (leur atout principal) on a pris 3 verres de vin au verre : un rosé d'Elodie Balme, un Chénas et un Sancerre. Les 3 étaient bons. Joli sélection au niveau de la carte. Il y a beaucoup d'importation privé et un choix conséquent.

C'est donc au niveau gustatif une expérience bonne mais sans découverte extraordinaire et malheureusement pas assez garni en quantité par rapport au prix payé. J'ai littéralement mangé au moins une baguette de pain pour me remplir le ventre et on était un soir donc sans une faim de loup ...

Plusieurs points positifs :
- Le service était amical
- Les vins sont top et on retrouve des choses rares au Québec
- Les plats étaient bons d'après mon ressentis personnel mais pas extraordinaire non plus.

Plusieurs points négatifs :
- Le serveur qui insiste pour nous faire prendre une entrée en attendant nos plats.
- Le vin servi qui est perlé et il faut en reparler au serveur pour qu'il le carafe énergiquement afin de le faire disparaitre. L'initiative était bonne.
- Les portions trop petites pour le prix
- C'était bruyant ...

Pas emballé plus que ca donc par cette expérience, avis mitigés dans notre table."}
{"text":"Le Pastaga est un de mes restos de quartier favoris si vous êtes dans la Petite Patrie ou passez par la Petite Italie il faut absolument l'essayer. J'adore le concept des petits plats à partager, les huitres y sont très bonnes et le must qu'il vous faut absolument commander c'est le porcelet laquée au sucre brun. Gardez vous aussi de l'appétit pour le dessert qui est toujours fabuleux. La carte des vins est aussi excellente, j'y fais souvent de belles découvertes et le vin est nature, donc adios les sulfites et autre tralala! Le service est toujours à point et gentil juste ce qu'il faut. On y retourne toujours toujours!"}
{"text":"Love this new restaurant, ranked one of the best by Air Canada enroute magazine in 2012!"}
{"text":"Gold Medal Winner at the Canadian Culinary Championships, Martin Juneau, has opened this bright, lovely, comfortable restaurant up on a northern stretch of St Laurent that's slowly waking up and increasing my love of this neighborhood. Pastaga sits alongside 3 contemporary art galleries and the newly renovated Vices et Versa in the formerly wasteland stretch of the Main above the underpass and before Little Italy. Two pages of all natural wines are just the beginning, I love the staff, the sweet and savoury menus, the big chef's table in the back for eating exceptional food while watching the Habs - the whole spirit of the place is chaleureux, classy but friendly, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love the food, the decor, the bio wines that they import from all over the world. You must try the pork belly dish - almost guaranteed to give foodgasms, yes, plural. Their chocolate mousse is also delightful."}
{"text":"The quality of food and the way it is served and presented is more refined than just your typical watering hole. The menu and décor maybe simple but the experience like no other.  The restaurant serves typical French bistro favorites but is the epitome of originality.  All dishes are well thought out and extra care is given to details. All the dishes from its simplest will awe you. Everything is beautifully plated and totally appetizing and inspiring."}
{"text":"Excellente nouvelle adresse, très décontractée, parfaite pour relaxer à la fin de la journée. Plusieurs petits plats à partager, huîtres délicieuses, quelques plats plus complets mais légers somme toute, plusieurs sandwichs. Très joli lieu un peu à l'écart de l'animation touristique du Vieux-port."}
{"text":"Mon restaurant coup de coeur du moment! Les plats sont délicieux, le service est impeccable et l'ambiance est super!

Nous avons pris le menu découverte avec l'accord mets et vin, et c'était divin! J'ai rarement manger un aussi bon plat de porc et une rillette de canard aussi merveilleuse! Ça fond en bouche! Le menu propose 4 services avec 4 accords pour seulement 51$+27$. Ça même pas d'allure comment c'est pas cher! Je trippe ma vie!

Je le recommande vraiment à tout le monde! C'est une petite merveille!"}
{"text":"SUper restaurant pour une soirée entre filles. Nous avons eu un excellent service et avons goûté des plats très délicieux et surtout à juste prix. Les vins sont super intéressants et les saveurs du mois à essayer pour sûr ! L'ambiance y est détendue et les gens qui fréquente l'endroit également ce qui est plaisant pour une soirée où l'on désire discuter tranquillement.
À trois personnes nous avons essayé 6 plats et 3 desserts et TOUT était délicieux et bien dosé.
J'aime beaucoup l'endroit où j'oserais retourner à chaque saison."}
{"text":"So delicious! Yummy, yummy, yummy!! Portions are a tiny bit small, bread underwhelming, but my GOD!!! Everything else is like a dance party for the taste buds. Holla!!"}
{"text":"Pastaga have been on my list for a long time and I finally got to try it last Monday night. The place on the inside is simply and beautifully decorated and the ambiance is very nice. The service was excellent as well. As for the food, we ordered 4 plates and one desert to share and all of them were simply delicious. It was a perfect culinary experience through which I discovered new flavors and associations of ingredients. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Second time at Pastaga and won't be my last. We started with a small cheese plate which we were able to choose from five choices. Our cold dishes came next... the celery root carpaccio was sooooo good I would've ordered a second! My boyfriend ordered the duck tartar. For the hot plates we ordered the deer médaillon and the porcelet. Unfortunately, my choice of the deer came cold instead of hot and I couldn't eat it because I'm pregnant and shouldn't be eating raw meats. The waiter had said something about the deer being so fresh that they decided to keep it cold (I think?)... anyways, maybe he should've asked first? But, no biggie... I was still savouring the previous plate! So I only had the porcelet which was tasty but the pancake reminded me of egg and God damn food aversions! My lucky boyfriend got to finish off that plate too. Regardless of my plate not being serve the way I imagined, I still enjoyed the food and the service was polite, casual and quick. Definitely a place to revisit."}
{"text":"The food in Pastaga is absolutely delicious and I will definitely come again. Very nice natural wine list to explore. The kitchen is separated by glass wall from the dining area and you can observe the chefs preparing the food. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the service. We had to wait 30 minutes to be offered water or drinks after being seated. Once we had the attention of our host everything was ok."}
{"text":"I went to Pastaga for the first time last night and loved it!! Excellent service, great wine, and some of the most delicious food I've ever eaten!! A lot of attention to detail. Seriously, it made me understand why so many of my friends are obsessed with dating chefs. We ordered oysters, salmon, duck, & pork. The portions are small so you get a good variety (they recommend ordering two each). Great music was playing, too."}
{"text":"This place reminded us a bit of Sel Gras that unfortunately closed down (tears...) 

Nice space, good 1st impression :) the staff is super nice and helpful. The waiter was very god with the wine list. We chose a nice natural wine from the South of France and it was great!

The food was over all quite good. We had the:
-oysters, 
-garlic bourgot snail with a velouté,
-chopped liver, 
-grilled octopus, 
-poached cod, 
-pan-seared foie gras with maple, 
-deer steak 
-yogurt panna cotta. 
I liked everything except for the poached cod that was very bland and the parsnip slices in the dish were too crunchy compared to the cod's texture so they didn't compliment each other very well. 

Recommended! Try some of the natural wine from their private imports, very good!"}
{"text":"I was there for the Taste MTL event. Overall great food, perfect flavors, and nice techniques. The servers were quite busy (totally normal during such events) and seemed a little overwhelmed, but the food was just perfect. On my bucket-list for brunches, too !"}
{"text":"Bien établi depuis plus de six ans, le pastaga est un établissement précurseur des vins nature. Doté d'un service courtois et efficace, l'établissement préconise le contacte avec ses fournisseurs. Mettant de l'avant les produits d'ici, Martin Juneau et son équipe saura vous épater à coup sûr."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We went on a Sunday night around 8PM and were seated immediately. The restaurant is very cozy, with nice unique wooden tables. The menu is extensive, offering cold plates and hot plates, cheeses and desserts.

The pork belly was the best thing I've ever eaten. The tuna tartar was extremely fresh and delicious. We also tried the burrata, which was not the highlight of the meal, but still very tasty."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a beer on a hot summer afternoon and I have to say it was a really nice place to sit out and enjoy the old port. Lots of outdoor seating available and had a nice relaxed atmosphere. The service was fast and efficient and the prices were not bad. We ordered beer and fries , a simple order but both were just what we wanted. Ice cold refreshing beer and nice crispy very well seasoned fries made fresh with a side of herb mayo for dipping, this really hit the spot! They don't have a huge menu but they have a few different things you can order like a burger or poutine or salads , wings etc... and they have a variety of beers and cocktails (as well as pitchers of white or red sangria -perfect for summer).This is a nice choice for a casual lunch or drink."}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the best restaurants in Montreal. Food was top notch, innovative, and just delicious. Service was very good. Wines were interesting and not too expensive. I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Pastaga has been on my list of restaurants to try for years now so I was excited to finally go. My boyfriend and I went Saturday night to try the MTL a Table menu ($31). Just so you know. they only had the MTL a table menu and you couldn't order stuff from the regular menu.

For starters my boyfriend had the squash creamy soup with smoked ricotta, squash seeds and hazelnut butter. The soup was thick and delicious. It was a bit sweet but in a good way and I liked that there was cheese in it. I, on the other hand, had the roasted cauliflower with vadouvan yogourt, cajun almonds and mint. This dish was better than I expected. It tasted a bit like curry and there was a lot of cauliflower. Out of the two starters, I preferred the cauliflower. 

For mains, my boyfriend and I shared the mushrooms risotto and the pork belly. It was better that way because the risotto dish was huge and the pork belly was small. The pork belly was an extra $3. The pickled eggplant really added to the dish. Out of the two mains, the pork belly was my favorite however, the starters were better than the mains. Some bites of the risotto felt a little bit undercooked for our liking.  It lacked consistency. 

The desserts were very good! My boyfriend had the pistachio ice cream with nuts and chocolate syrup. Can't go wrong with pistachio ice cream. I had the chocolate mousse with sponge toffee and caramel foam. The latter tasted like a crunchie chocolate bar which happens to be my favorite chocolate bar. 

The service was very good. We ordered a bottle of wine that the waiter recommended for us. I liked the wine but my boyfriend didn't like it right away but it did grow on him as the meal went on and the wine aerated. The waiter felt bad and thought we really didn't like the wine so he brought us over two black Russians. That was really thoughtful. We ended up buying a round of tequila shots and did them with our waiter."}
{"text":"Un super de bon resto,je crois que c'est une des meilleurs place que j'ai manger à mtl pour un resto style français.Le menu de Martin est vraiment ça hauteur.La vitre sur la cuisine donne une ambiance frindly 9.5/10"}
{"text":"My manager took us out on a Sunday evening. Place was not too packed. We were seated close to another couple which gave us an opportunity to eye our neighbors tasty plates. Portion size looked small but let me tell you it fit just right in my tummy. I started of with oysters and we a shared grilled  octopus. Appetizers were outstanding! Oysters fresh and tasted like from the sea and octopus had that nice char... And really tender! My main meal was the porcelet and pancake - flavors were amazying, I can see why it's their classic dish. Lastly desert was the tarte au pomme -   Omg I was in food heaven. The buttery dough paired with the icecream, nuts and Carmel sauce just made my mouth water. 

Give this place a try guys, it's a great place to eat well and for me it's worth to spend money on great food & service. Reasonably priced also."}
{"text":"Je cherchais un beau & bon restaurant où inviter ma copine pour la St-Valentin en février dernier et je me suis dit que Pastaga aller être l'endroit pour. Effectivement, nous avons adorés notre expérience tant au niveau du service professionnel du serveur, des prix (entre 15,5$ & 19,75$ plats), de la qualité de la nourriture (pieuvre grillée 17$ + mille feuille 8$), du vin bio (70$) et de la décoration de l'endroit + cuisine vitrée où l'on peut voir les cuisiniers à l'oeuvre. Total pour deux avec taxes/service, 2 plats, 2 desserts + bouteille de vin bio = 159,99$. Le chef Martin Juneau n'était malheureusement pas sur place. On reviendra pour essayer leur brunch la fin de semaine. À coup sûr, un des meilleurs restaurants à Montréal. Pastaga est localisé sur le boulevard St-Laurent, entre le Mile End et la Petite Italie et ouvert depuis 2012. Réservation suggéré. 

5/5 visité en février 2016"}
{"text":"This review is based on my Brunch experience at Pastaga.

After eating all these heavy food for the last few days, Pastaga's experience was a change of pace in a good way. As one cannot have foie gras every meal.

Service was pleasant and accommodating. Menu is in French only but our waiter was really patient and answered all my questions with a smile. 

The menu is seasonal and changes frequently, but all you need to know is everything here is fresh, well prepared and delicious. 

Quiche au chorizo et fenouil caramélisés, fromage frais et salade verte ($14.50)
Croquettes de Porcelet ($14.50)
Gaufres natures, crème chantilly et sirop d'érable ($7)

I just love the casual and unpretentious vibe of Pastaga. 

I definitely want to come back here for a full dinner experience!"}
{"text":"Over a year ago now, I visited Pastaga for a Sunday brunch and left with the strong feeling of needing to return for dinner. It took way too long but through Taste MTL, I finally did. For the uninitiated, Pastaga is the brainchild of chef Martin Juneau who, since opening this restaurant in 2012, has opened up Pub St-Joseph as well as the Mr. Crémieux food truck. Pastaga is a ode of nature wines as well as great food to pair with those wines. The food definitely has French influences at its core but branches out extensively in other food genres.  

Located on the relatively barren strip of St-Laurent just before little Italy but after Mile End, the restaurant is a small, simple space with mirror walls, misshapen wooden tables and ample lighting via power bars on the ceiling. The real beautiful touch is the bright red tilted kitchen that is visible in the back of the space. A glass wall blocks out the sound from the dining room but we can see everything going on. There is also a large table located in the kitchen for larger groups to enjoy if you can get it. Overall, it is a very cozy and comfortable environment to enjoy a meal in.

I visited during Taste MTL where they were offering a 39$ menu of items off their current seasonal menu. Me and my dining companions ordered all of the options to try. First up, there was grilled Albacore tuna with braised fennel and citrus gel. The tuna was grilled to perfection. The braised fennel and the citrus were perfect compliments to the fish. A very nice start to the meal. 

Next up was marinated salmon with salmon jerky and a creamy potato salad. The salmon was, like the tuna, cooked perfectly. The potato salad was, as indicated, quite creamy with a strong hint of dill which paired very nicely with the salmon - bringing to mind a classic smoked salmon dish in terms of taste.

The third main was a play on Jewish chopped liver with bagel chips, capers and hard boiled eggs. Now, I have never been a big fan of chopped liver. Despite my enjoyment of foie gras, the texture of Jewish-style chopped liver always created a roadblock for me. I went in with some apprehension but came out loving it. The texture of the liver was not an issue and had that great fatty flavour. The pickled onions brought some sweetness to that dish. The hard boiled egg was perfect and the bagel chips added that little bit of crunch and saltiness. A very well executed dish.

The final main was, to me, the best thing we had all night - maple lacquered pork on a pancake with a parsnip salad. The pork and pancake combination was brillant - the right mix of sweetness, fattiness and starch. The pork, in particular, just fell apart without any effort. Great texture achieved by the kitchen staff there. The salad of parsnip added a little crispness and freshness so you felt a little better health-wise about eating pork, maple syrup and pancakes for dinner!

For dessert, there were 2 options plus a cheese plate. The cheese plate was a goat cheese with candied nuts, apple butter and a mini cake loaf. The goat cheese (I forgot the name of it sadly) was quite good - soft but still firm enough to handle properly. The other 3 elements of the plate allowed you to add different levels of sweetness to pair with the cheese - the apple butter was a particularly wonderful surprise in terms of its strong flavour and consistency. 

In terms of desserts proper, we had the choice of a Mr. Crémeux Sundae with milk crumble and sous-vide Prunes or a raspberry cheesecake. The sundae was delicious. Anyone who visited the Mr. Crémeux food truck over the summer knows that Chef Juneau and company know how to make a great soft serve vanilla ice cream. The addition of sous-vide prunes provided some tartness and the crumble was nice and crunchy. The cheesecake was good as well - the texture was spot-on and the coulis was nice as well. 

Dinner at Pastaga met all of my expectations and more. Our waiter provided great service especially in terms of the wine pairings for each dish. You could tell he knew his wine list well. The food was wonderful across the board and the dining room itself relaxed and quiet enough to allow good conversation. This meal reinforced the notion that I waited way too long to stop by for dinner. I will definitely not make that mistake again... and I hope you don't either.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Everything we had here was perfect.  The pork belly was so tender and had a brown sugar crust.  The scallops came in a thick corn soup - we could have licked the bowl.  We also had a beet salad and tuna, two selections of cheese, and a chocolate mousse dessert.  All were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I went there with a group of friends ... we were at chef table inside the kitchen... it was marvellous
The food , the service , the whole experience.!!!
If you ever have the chance ... please go to chef table .... 
Pastaga is definitely a must .'!!!!"}
{"text":"Pastaga is a great place for top-notch chef-quality food. The space is small-ish, but comfortable and bright, with an open kitchen for watching the magic happen. The staff on my recent visit were helpful, knowledgeable, and efficient, but never intrusive. 

They have a nice wine selection and fantastic cheeses, but the food is the star here, and it shines brightly

Highly recommended"}
