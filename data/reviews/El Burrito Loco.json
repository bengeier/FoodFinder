{"text":"Just got the carnita special (with corn tortillas) from the food cart on the Capitol square.  The price was $8.  The señorita taking my order was attentive and polite.  A couple customers stopped by and chatted with her briefly, so they must get regulars.  The carnita meat, hot sauce, cilantro and guacamole were really good.  No radishes or salsa verde like I'm used to, which is fine - might just be a regional thing.  However, the tortillas were a bit stiff, like they were taken straight from the packaging or were just microwaved, not heated up on the griddle. In any case they stuck together in a way that it was clear that if they were heated up, they weren't heated separately. The beans tasted exactly like the Rosarita \"spicy jalapeño\" brand you get out of a can, and didn't have any cheese on top.  The rice was good, but was just regular Mexican rice - for $8 would be nice if they went a little further and put some veggies in there like onions, potatoes, carrots, peas or something.  I'd give the experience about 3.5 / 5 stars on the whole.  I'll stop by again some time and try a different menu item."}
{"text":"Amigos!  I'm excited to tell you about very good Mexican food in Madison, WI! I'll be back to add some more info, but El Burrito Loco has been on this corner since about 2002 and what's this?! No Yelp review?! It's time.  I had a the huge chicken burrito special at $7.  It could be the best tasting value in town! It had all the usual ingredients inside including, cheese, pinto beans, rice, a lot of fresh (stewed...don't be afraid - its good!) chicken and salsa. They are all wrapped up in a soft huge flour tortilla. yumm. I asked for the spicy salsa and it was just about right.  Oh and don't let me forget to tell you that it had a pretty big side of guacamole...and it was good!  Did I mention it was big?! See pix.  I'm pretty sure they are only at this Capitol location during lunch time, but it's worth the trip. Tell Maggie Hi and that Raul (From San Diego, living in NYC since 2001) I said Hola!  Let's open up a stand in NYC! Come on!  Orale!   See you next time I'm in town!  ~r"}
{"text":"Ordered the house burrito and quesadillas for lunch.   Prices were reasonable, service was friendly but a bit on the slow side for a food cart.   Product got the job done.   Burrito didn't feel like street food because it was very messy to eat and required a fork and knife.   Overall, not a bad option in the area if you are specifically looking for Tex Mex, but I suspect some of the other food carts with longer lines probably offer a better experience."}
{"text":"My goal was to find the busiest food cart for lunch and order from there (it should be noted that I LOVE the Madison Food Cart scene). Turns out El Burrito Loco was the busiest on a Monday afternoon around 11:45 a.m. Let's wait in line and give it a try.  Lots of menu options that all seemed reasonable priced. Next to the order window there was a small board that listed the \"Specials\". I saw people walking away with huge platters and my attention went to the specials with a hard focus - steak fajita burrito - sign me up!!! I waited to place my order and knew what I wanted. Definitely the steak fajita burrito in one of those big platters. At $8.00 I was determined that this was going to be an excellent choice!  Then I waited a little longer for the woman taking orders to finish writing on the \"Today's Special\" board. I was even told \"it will just be a minute\" while she wrote. Not the best impression but I get it - she's busy (and clearly was very busy with orders - 7 people ahead of me waiting on food). Just maybe something to do before you open for business so I don't need to wait any longer. All things considered it was not a very long wait to order. Ordered my food and asked spicy or mild. Let's get spicy!!!  I placed my order and waited for that huge platter that will hold my delicious steak fajita burrito, beans, rice, guacamole and more to appear from the small confines of El Burrito Loco. I was perfectly fine with the wait and knew what I was getting myself into. One note - if you are looking for FAST food cart food this may not be your best choice. You can probably \"order and go\" if there is no one in front of you but it took about 8 minutes from when I started to wait in live to order until I received my food.  Slowly walking up the front of the food line I hear my food called and get ready to grab the box. But wait. This isn't a huge platter. It's an over sized hot dog container. It's not what everyone else was getting. How can there be a delicious steak fajita burrito in there with all of the beans and rice and guacamole and other stuff? I can't answer these questions by waiting for my normal \"office reveal\". I need to open and see for myself. Turns out everything listed is all wrapped up in a flour tortilla. Beans and rice are not separate. Guacamole is not separate. I kind of feel like someone stole my balloon and laughed as they let it go into the sky...  The weight is ample but I felt like I didn't really get what I wanted. Everything (except this one dish) seems to be delivered in a platter with separate sides. I don't know if that is my fault for assuming but even if it is, I didn't like it.  It's a really big burrito. Really big. It had an almost perfect amount of heat. Almost exactly what I think of when I order spicy - not hot enough that you're wondering \"Why???\". Good flavor and a huge amount of steak. It's so big that you can't feasibly eat this by hand. Get yourself a fork and knife because that is the only way to get it all down. As I mentioned, everything was in the burrito - steak, onions, peppers, rice, beans, sour cream and guacamole. Good flavor. Overall a good burrito that satisfied. Plenty of food but nothing that I think exceeded my expectations. The price was justified. This was a good lunch choice. I don't know if I'll be back any time soon and would probably choose a brick and mortar Mexican restaurant before trying this food cart again.  El Burrito Loco seems like it has a really good customer base and I am certain they are all very happy with their food. I was a little disappointed with what I received but that can be overlooked. The food had good taste and the presence of this cart helps balance what is being offered in the area. I think their presence is good for the Madison Food Cart movement - with a little refinement (yes, I know they've been around for quite a while) I think they could be a shining star!"}
{"text":"Got the bean tacos with hot sauce for lunch yesterday. The sauce was super spicy, which I absolutely loved, and everything tasted very authentic. The tortillas were some of the best I've ever had.  My only complaint is that it was a little heavy on cilantro, but that's not keeping me from going back for lunch again today."}
