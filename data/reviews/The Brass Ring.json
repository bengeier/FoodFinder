{"text":"The Brass Ring is a perfect place to go if you are looking for a place to practice your pool skills, check out a unique beer list, or catch a laid back round of trivia. Make sure to check out their specials because on certain days, an hour of pool is just a few bucks for the whole table."}
{"text":"I've been to The Brass Ring a number of times to play pool, shuffleboard, and/or darts (all while drinking beer).    But last night I went for my first ever trivia night and it was a lot of fun! It was easy and the staff was so welcoming even though it was my first time joining in.  What's so great is that it is free to play, but you can win $40, $20, or $10 based off your score. If you want to have a fun night with your friends, I definitely recommend going Thursdays (starts at 7:30) or on Sunday (starts at 5:30).    If you don't want to do trivia, that's ok!  The Brass Ring offers a million other activities that are fun to do sober or while sipping on your favorite adult beverage.  They also serve food and have tables throughout the building.   It's also a great spot to start your night out if you plan on seeing a show at The High Noon.  It is located right next door!   Usually I like more low-key places to hang out.  I find places that are large, and noisy to be a little overwhelming, but I've always had a great time when visiting.    The only reason that  I am not giving 5 stars is that my friends and I ordered some nachos (twice...don't ask) last night and the cheese wasn't melted all the way.  We still ate all of them (twice), so it must not have been that bad.  Ha. :)"}
{"text":"It's a fun bar to go and drink. Their food is also good. The only thing is, if you want service, definitely order from the bar. I have been here so many times and after a while I always try to give the servers a chance again... They never get faster."}
{"text":"While the place is nice and the pools are of good quality, I will never return to the Brass ring. The reason? I experienced the worst service I ever had. We went there to drink a cocktail and play pool (so I can't say anything about food quality). The cocktails were OK - a bit too strong for my taste - and the bartender was haughty and unfriendly, to say the least. I guess that anyone can have a bad day, but the bartender probably had the worst day ever to be that disrespectful. Whether such behavior is an exception or frequent at the Brassing ring bar, I will never know as I do not intend to come back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great place for a party.  We had a birthday party there, the food was fab, the beer was ice cold, the bar was attractive and the staff was great.  Would certainly use them again, or go back for drinks and dinner."}
{"text":"A great place for a quick meal before seeing a band at the High Noon or a good alternative if you feel like talk to your friends rather than shouting at them. Good burgers, decent beer selection, and I love the Irish potatoes. Service is hit and miss. At first, all the pool tables lined up see a little odd, but the longer you look at them, the more you want to play."}
{"text":"A sad example of a struggling pool hall trying to attract the millennial crowd. Substandard cocktails mixed with inexperienced (unprofessional) service makes for a experience best not had. Downtown Madison is not that much further away. Don't bother stopping here."}
{"text":"I've had quite a few great nights at the Brass Ring, but there is always an outside chance that I hit an off night and the experience isn't very enjoyable.  The bar is nice and open, well-lit and built to keep people from standing on top of each other.  The pool tables and the shuffleboard table are in great shape and the cost is pretty reasonable.  When on a table there is usually a waitress that keeps the drinks flowing.  I've never been upstairs or in the dining area for an actual dinner, but the appetizers have always been quite good.  The Brass Ring shares an outdoor patio area with the High Noon, and it can be a great place to hang out during the summer months.  I especially like the tap selection, as it always includes three or four top-notch beers from local micros (Lake Louie, Ale Asylum, etc.).  I often drop in for a quick drink before doors open for shows at the High Noon.  Parking can be an issue, but I usually hit up the MG&E lots up the block, which are open for parking at night.  The downside: sometimes the bartenders can be surprisingly aloof and rude.  On occasion my friends and I have had jukebox selections skipped by the bartender, then told to shove off when we asked for a refund on our dollar.  This is annoying to be sure, but I don't plug the juke all that much here as the selections aren't all to my liking.  What does really piss me off is when you find yourself standing at the bar, money in hand, for close to 10 minutes watching the two bartenders joke with each other and steal glances your way.  This would definitely be a four star place if not for this type of aggravation.  It's not frequent enough to make me stop going here, but it certainly can mar an otherwise great night out with friends."}
{"text":"A few co-workers and I met here last Friday to get together.  We all needed to blow off some steam about work and a bar seemed like the perfect place to do it.  It was fairly busy, since it was a Friday, but the waitress we had did a pretty good job of checking on us.  We were even checked on by who I believe to be a manager a couple times.  I ordered a couple well drinks and was pleasantly surprised by how good they tasted.  You can never be too sure with a well drink... I ordered cheese curds to munch on and while they were good, they were not anything special.  My co-worker got the hummus wrap and she seemed to enjoy that a lot.  Pricing for everything seemed average.  No bargains, but you weren't going to pay an arm and a leg for basic bar food either.  I liked the atmosphere a lot, but I'm not sure if I'll make an effort to return."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday afternoon.  We were able to park, but took the last available space.    Inside is fairly nice and there are a ton of pool tables, if that's your thing.  Prices were reasonable.  The wait staff weren't great.  I'm not sure if they were overworked or what, but my table and the table behind us had to repeat orders.  I got a spicy chicken sandwich and started feeling sick on the drive home.  I'm not blaming the Brass Ring for that, but it certainly cemented feeling ill with going to the Brass Ring.  It might be worth it for customers to make the extra trek into the downtown to get better food, service and atmosphere for the same price."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout* from The Brass Ring tonight, since I had won a gift card at work. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. Taking into account the fact that it was takeout, and the food stewed in a styro box for about 5 minutes I would have this to say: Meh Yeah, just meh. It seems like the place must use about 90% pre-prepared Sysco products. From past experience ordering appetizers here while playing pool along with this experience, it's just a mediocre culinary tour de meh. Here's my anal-retentive breakdown of the burger.  My desired medium-rare burger patty was a few degrees past medium-well done and didn't even taste as if it were salted. It was dwarfed by the bun, and the bun wasn't big - literally a 2/3\" circle of bun was viable ringing the entire burger...not cool. The tomato was super ripe and fresh, as was the onion. The pickle spear was cold and crispy, not bad. The lettuce wasn't brown, but it was pretty well past its prime, but I ate it so it wasn't unserviceable.  This was a \"fancy\" burger so it also had a couple small onion rings on it (tasty, but you really can't mess up an onion ring unless you forget to cook it) and chipotle BBQ sauce. The sauce was actually pretty good, a little bit of heat, and not overly burdened with sugar. Pretty sure it was made in house from pre-made bottles of other sauces. The bun wasn't stale, but it was crispy, like they tried to toast it up in an oven but left it in 3 minutes too long. Average style cheddar cheese also made an appearance.  The fries were cooked damn near perfect and salted adequately. They even stayed a little crispy after 5 minutes in styrofoam, I suspect witchcraft.  The whole thing came with utensils, condents and napkins without even asking. Big plus.  I'll happy spend the remaining 12 bucks left on the gift card and eat there again. But with all the other food options within a 1mile radius of here, it might be a while till I return to try another burger. The fries though...  *This review is for the food only. From experience I can say that the bartenders are friendly, the amenities above average, and the overall atmosphere of the place is very nice."}
{"text":"The good: Outstanding Server this week for dinner.  Neutral: Standard, heavy, greasy Wisconsin bar food.  The bad: Inconsistent policies and poor communication with regards to getting our name on a list to play pool. We put our name on the list when we sat down to eat. Our name was called while we were still wrapping up dinner and we were told that we would be called next by deferring our table. We then waited an additional hour plus for a pool table and and after 2 other names were called were now told that we were actually put at the bottom of the list (even though our server had told us otherwise). Never got to a pool table after 2.5 hours in the joint.   Improved communication and a modicum of concern from the pool emcee would have prevented a disappointing Brass Ring experience."}
{"text":"This place was awful. I just left. This is my second trip to Madison and my friend took me here. It was a Sunday morning and the place was nearly empty.   Something was wrong with their water...we could not drink it. We ordered soda waters and they tasted fine. But they charged for soda water (whaaaaaat?? I know)  I ordered the smokestack and the soup of the day. The soup was extremely salty and the sandwich was this: lower bun , turkey, bacon, cheese, bun top. Zero effort to make a decent sandwich on their part.   My friend had the salmon salad and said it was fine. My other friend had a grilled cheese and he couldn't eat it...he said it was too cheesy, which sounds like well duh you ordered a grilled cheese, but it was more the fact that it was just not well balanced so it just felt like biting a slab of melted cheese.  Bad, bad experience."}
{"text":"I had difficulty with picking between 3 or 4 stars. I gave 4 because our service that evening was superior. The waitress was so attentive to everything and so very nice. Myself, along with many others came out to the Brass Ring to watch the amazing Madison Radicals for their semi final game. They use wifi and apple TV for broadcasting - it kept freezing up, so that was quite annoying and disappointing. They did end up fixing things by the second half which we were happy about. Myself and friends shared a pitcher of the Dirty Bastard, how could you not love it with a name like that!  It was a night creamy dark beer on tap. We ordered some cheese curds which were pretty good. They came with an option of 4 dipping sauces (I'd stick with ranch) we tried all 4. I ordered the Bleu Garlic Burger. I thought it was good, nice flavor - cooked how I requested. One complaint that I had was the water - I couldn't drink it.  It tasted like it was straight from a swimming pool - lots of chlorine. blech! The atmosphere of the Brass Ring is nice, very nice large outdoor seating area too. I would come here again for some good beer on tap and good bar food."}
{"text":"Fun place to go that's not super far from downtown!   On of the major attractions here is their pool hall. They have an above average number of pool tables available for rent. Space is nice and the tables are nice as well.  We came here for trivia on Wednsday at 7 pm, and it was a fun time! They are part of league trivia but I liked this locations the most so far because they actually display the questions on TVs so you don't have to worry about it if you can't hear the announcers too well.  Good selection of draft beers as well!   Not sure if this would be a great place for sports watching though - smaller tvs and not a lot of them around the entire bar"}
{"text":"8/18/13 My wife and I stopped in.  We played pool, drank a pitcher, and ate an appetizer.  It was great.  We had a GroupOn and were still treated with the respect we deserved.  We also had to have a martini and a bourbon too!  :-)"}
{"text":"The food is average-to-good Madison fare, but the happy hour prices are superb, the service is fine, and the management is incredibly helpful to the point of bending over backwards. The space is fine, but they have more pool tables for the size than any other Madison bar, which means not having to wait hours for your turn. Great Friday hangout while waiting for a show at the nearby High Noon."}
{"text":"Half off bottles of wine on Wednesday's and swing dancing during the evening, what more could you ask for? Just bring some good company, split a bottle of wine, test out your dance moves or people watch for a bit. Both are equally entertaining and a good time.   I have to brush up in my swing dancing but I will definitely be back, hopefully after some lessons:)   Parking is easy on the street or in the lot and the people are super friendly.   Happy dancing!"}
{"text":"I like the Brass Ring. Even though the ceilings are a ba-jillion feet tall, it feels cozy inside. The pool tables are challenging (they're HUGE) and the service is just attentive enough. On top of that they have decent food and really well crafted drinks. Hendrick's press with freshly muddled cucumber? Don't mind if I do. This place is not cheap, so keep that in mind if you are on a budget. But it is a fun place to hang out with a small group and have a good time."}
{"text":"Why is it that whenever a new bar goes up in Madison they insist on making it feel like it belongs in Fitchburg? Other than that, it's not a bad spot to shoot some pool, grab some cheese curds and a pitcher to relax. It's over on East Wash in the sort of no-man's-land, which keeps the kiddies out. Not necessarily a destination, but a good spot to start off your evening."}
{"text":"Went for the pool. Too expensive. Around $10.00 for one hour. Depending on number of players and skill level, that's about two three games per hour. I'm used to the $1.50 per game. Ordered a long Island. Wasn't prepared very well."}
{"text":"Beer was fantastic and the food delish (portobello burger). Waiter did excellent job. We played trivia and had a great time."}
{"text":"My go to spot to play pool with friends. There are about 9 pool tables available to rent by the hour. I usually call in to make sure there are some pool tables available so I don't have to wait, but it's usually packed for sure on a Friday or Saturday night.   Their food is also really good. Their French Dip and spicy Jamaican Jerk Boneless Wing Skewers are two of my favorites on their menu. I've had their burgers and bison burgers, nothing special. Their customer service has always been great and on point.  They also have an outdoor area and are next to the High Noon Saloon, where you can catch a show after playing some pool."}
{"text":"The only times I've come here is for after game drinks with my team (Madison Sports and Social club had a deal for a free pitcher after games), but it's always been a fun time! Good selection of draft beers, delicious cheese curds (probably some of the better ones in Madison), and a great, comfortable atmosphere. Sometimes the service can get a little sketchy when it's super busy, but we're just there to hang out, so we don't mind! Food is pretty acceptable too.  My friends have come for the pool, and they say it's fun--will need to try that sometime!"}
{"text":"Only got a chance to sit and drink water while my friends drank at the bar, but the atmosphere was enjoyable. Pretty spacious and had a section for playing pool. Bartenders were nice. Random drunk old man beside us was dishing out advice. Not a bad spot to have drinks and watch some sports on the TVs."}
{"text":"I was invited out to Brass Ring for a big birthday party for a friend of mine.  Dinner first, with about 12 other ladies, and then a bit of Reggae and Dancehall next door so said birthday woman could shake it like a polaroid picture.    Last time I was in Brass Ring was about, geez...... 8 years ago?  I was heavy into playing pool in my 20's and Brass Ring has got some great pool tables.  4 stars just for that fact.  Madison isn't really known for any great pool halls... Cueniques was closed down due to mobs of people deciding they wanted to fight in the street at 2am.... and well..... not much to speak of has taken Cuenique's place...  But Brass Ring is low key.. Not many tables, but enough...   Add some good food to the mix and I will keep Brass Ring on my playlist.  While out with me ladies I ordered the Bourbon Street Salmon Salad, which boasts a 5 ounce Norwegian Salmon Filet grilled with a bourbon glaze and served on a bed of greens with parmesan cheese, onions, tomato & cucumber with a side of \"Texas Caviar.\"    Can I say Yum?..  I think I said Yum...   It was gooooooooood    I've found myself a bit more of a homebody these days, especially in the winter - I tend to hibernate - so I passed up the dance party that ensued after dinner, but I witnessed the pictures and it looked like a great time.    Like this place."}
{"text":"I have become a frequent patron here thanks to their partnership with Madison sports and social club. While we love the free pitchers, without this bringing us in we would go elsewhere. The service is almost always underwhelming. We have often asked for something to be shown on tv and the servers have made it seem like the biggest imaginable hassle to change the channel or turn on the tv. I've had a variety of food- chicken wings, quesadillas and some sandwiches. Everything is fine but nothing is particularly special.  We will keep coming so long as we keep getting free pitchers but  it's not one of my top choices."}
{"text":"Fun place. Good food, pool tables. great vibe."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot before or after games, because the food is decent, and you can always find a table, because the place is huge. We called seven places in the area on a Friday night before the basketball game, every single one of them had 60 to 90 minute wait... We remembered the brass ring, call them, no wait... Perfect! Great beer selection, and standard pub fare. The only thing I wasn't a fan of, is the bartenders meticulously measuring pours... It gave it a chain/mall restaurant kind of feel."}
{"text":"I have been to this lovely place a number of times to shoot pool...eight tables on the main level. Great lighting, fabulous atmosphere of brick and wood. If you enjoy pool in a decent atmosphere, THIS is the place!! The beer taps are rotating and generally never fail to impress! Food menu is fair to good. I'm not here for foot today, so I can't recommend a particular menu item. Great patron camaraderie, GREAT afternoon light, and just a sweet vibe. Bartenders tend to be fun and knowledgeable. Parking is just short of sucks in the lot, but generally can be found on the street."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited for Sunday evening trivia last weekend and were both disappointed. I arrived first and stood by the \"wait to be seated\" sign only to be completely ignored by all staff. I finally just told a passing waitress that I was going to seat myself and she couldn't have cared less. Later, when we tried to order drinks, we were given only a beer menu that was confusing. (Why is there a whole list of the back of beers that aren't available? Why even tell me the prices if I can't have any of them?) I asked the waitress for a wine list and was told that \"it's not very exciting\" but she'd bring one out. On the upside, the fries and nachos were pretty good."}
{"text":"Was visiting and made this my first stop for drinks and food. Got to seat myself wherever I wanted- which always is a plus.   The server was really nice. She handles us in a good timely manner and always made sure we were taken care of. Unfortunately, she didn't introduce herself so I don't know it.  Drinks were strong definitely worth my penny.  The highlight of the night was the BBQ CHIPOTLE sauce I got for my chicken fingers. They should sell that bad boy - I would definitely buy a few bottles!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great, but a lot of pool tables.  Not too much else to say other than parking sometimes sucks due to popular shows at the High Noon next door."}
{"text":"Brass Ring is a great neighborhood bar! The patio is certainly its best feature, and I'm counting down the days until patio season. I particularly enjoy Brass Ring for Wisconsin sports - they often have a big screen/projector set up so there are lots of viewing options which brings out a lot of passionate fans.  Their food menu is middle of the road - nothing too exceptional, but it's satisfying enough. Additionally, this is a great place for shooting pool and playing shuffleboard. This past Fall, the Tenney-Lapham neighborhood newsletter offered coupons for Brass Ring for food, drinks, and games; and I definitely appreciate the outreach to bring in local residents!"}
{"text":"I think I found a new favorite pub, and it might be brass ring.  Came here on a Sunday afternoon. We sat outside with the other Madison sports teams. We were served waters and beer quickly. I ordered the hummus wrap with fries on the side. That hummus wrap; I can write songs about that wrap. Savory crunchy healthy perfection. I was in love.  Environment was stellar. Space outside was open and inviting, and brass ring welcomed the dogs we had with us. One server even provided some water for my friend's dog, which was so appreciated.  The only criticism would be that the fries were too salty and many were burnt and unappetizing. I am however very willing to come back, and I plan on having that hummus wrap over and over."}
{"text":"Ok... Been sitting here without a drink for 30 mins. We started outside and came inside thinking the service would be better... Nope! But the first drink was great!"}
{"text":"I work near-ish by, so this is a go to spot for when I want an upgrade from my standard Lean Cuisine lunch.  My personal favorite is the Bourbon St Salmon Salad  But these items are also very good: Irish nachos black and bleu caesar salad Veggie Pita  Service is pretty fast, so is really good for lunch in the middle of the work day.  Also, the place is huge and has pool tables, so it is probably pretty awesome at night too."}
{"text":"Had dinner there this week for the first time.  I've got to say I really enjoyed the vibe. Even though the place wasn't crowded it had a nice vibe going on. They have plenty of pool tables and TVs to make most everyone happy.  Great and pretty extensive beer and liquor selection as well.  Did I mention that there is plenty of free parking too?  That's not the norm in downtown Madison.    I ordered a sandwich and chips.  The food came out in good time, was more than enough to fill me and was delicious.  The service was good, the food was good and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been to the Brass Ring for everything from a drink to watching a game to dinner and it's been enjoyable all around. My last visit was for lunch and I went for my go-to sandwich, the Smokestacker. A pile of very thinly sliced smoked turkey + crispy bacon + provolone is a great start, but when you add the chipotle mayo you've got one of my favorite turkey sandwiches in town. Add to that some delicious fries (which I also recommend you put the mayo to use on) and you've got one happy lady.  I also want to give a shout-out to their BBQ pulled pork on a ciabatta roll that they had available during the Badger basketball final - if you see that come up as a special, it's a good choice if you want to mix it up from their regular menu.  The only snafu I've experienced with them was the night of the basketball final - there was a lot of confusion with saving seats and moving tables back and forth - but in the end it worked out more or less, albeit our group ending up at tables on opposite sides of the dining area. If I end up there for another big game, I'll just be sure to ask for a manager to see what the situation is when we get there to avoid confusion."}
{"text":"Big surprise here... the food is good... like really good. The grass fed burger options are stellar. Get the Boss Burger - order it rare just to be safe... it'll probably show up medium rare to medium. But I still find this mostly acceptable as most bars in Madison cook burgers to shoe leather no matter how you order them.  The chicken tenders - wow... I think they are scratch made in house. It's a big shareable portion.   The drinks are derivable. I've had decent Old Fashioneds and good Martini's. Good selection of beers... and nice selection of affordable call booze. Oh there's a poll hall as well."}
{"text":"one of my go to spots in madison...great draft selection, knowledgeable bartenders, great food, pool, darts, shuffle board, huge area with massive tvs and great prices"}
{"text":"the brass ring... where some people go to play pool, and incredibly bland people come to drink themselves stupid. meh."}
{"text":"Deck the halls with pools of pool!   CLUUURRRRLY the place to be on Wednesday night for trivia. Almost everyone who's there is playing and INTO. IT.  Deal on New Belgium Beers...Hell, get a pitcher while you're at it."}
{"text":"I don't know when it happened but the brass rings food has taken a major landslide fall far from what it once was... If you are looking for a good burger don't bother to show up at the brass ring."}
{"text":"A little pricy given available watering holes but the pool tables are nice and the beer selection is still superior to many. Parking is plentiful."}
{"text":"I went here twice in the past week to meet up with friends that were in town for the holidays.  It's a nice relaxing atmosphere where you can actually talk to each other without straining to listen.  The high ceilings and woodwork are a nice touch."}
{"text":"Not my usual spot, but my girl friends and I decided to try this venue for TGIF.  Dude, the happy hours price is excellent - $2 a rail for Friday!! I appreciated that so much. The happy hours last until 7pm, and that's long enough to squeeze fair amount of after-work liquor therapy. After 7, it was $3.75 a rail. Still a fair price.  The bar tenders were friendly, the service was quick. The food is average bar food, but not bad. I'd say this is a good place for group outing.   And, I have to advertise that the beautiful carpentry done at the bar is work of my friend. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do :)"}
{"text":"I've only been to the Brass Ring a few times, to play pool or to play trivia, but as pubs go, it's a nice one. The lighting level is good, not too bright or too dark, and it's very roomy and open inside while still retaining a sense of coziness, not an easy thing to pull off.   The food is quite good, also. I'm kind of a BLT affectionata, and I really enjoyed my chipotle BLT with pub chips tonight. The bacon tasted freshly cooked, neither over or underdone, and was very flavorful. I usually don't like the bread to be grilled because of the heavy, greasy feel it gives to the sandwich, but Brass Ring grilled it in such a way that it was nicely crispy outside and not greasy at all. The chipotle mayo is served on the side and adds nice flavor and heat. The pub chips were a little burnt tasting, not the best I've had; the only off note. The dill pickle spear was on point, nicely garlicy and dilly, with no hint of sweetness.   I paired it with a PsycHOPath tap beer (which was served in the correct glassware), and at $4 was a very good value. The tap beer list isn't huge, but has enough variety to keep most folks happy. (DC only drinks Budweiser, and of course they had that for him, so he was happy.)   The service is the perfect balance of friendly and efficient, if only a wee bit slow. The trivia night was one of the better ones I've been to. We had a very good time, and will do it again soon."}
{"text":"Ate at Brass Ring for a lunch gathering.   No problems getting a spot, plenty of options. There was a table big enough for our group of 6. The waitress split the checks, which was very nice of her. Service was perfect. Food was pretty good too, nothing that was mind blowing, but left satisfied after having ate wings and a Smokestacker sandwich."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly and the waitress was awesome and very attentive.  The problem? Small, bland burgers and expensive burgers.  Just an ok place as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Why, oh why did it take me so long to grab a beer with you Brass Ring? You're woody.  You're expansive.  You're hip. You have an awesome music venue next door!  Not certain why I didn't cross East Wash sooner, the place is practically in my front yard, but I'm glad I did. Some friends found it easy to have conversation even though the place was hopping, and there's a decent selection of brews."}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  First, even though it was early on a Wednesday night and not terribly busy they told us they couldn't seat our group of 8 because we were to large.  Eventually they did push a couple tables together for us, but that should have just been our cue to leave.  It took forever to get anything, and we had to ask for everything, including napkins, silverware, ketchup and refills on water. When my burger came it was well done when I asked for medium.  I tried waiting for her to come back and ask for a new one because when I pay $14 for a burger I want it to be cooked the way I asked, but she took so long and I was so hungry I gave up and ate it.  The fries were cold suggesting it had been sitting out for a long time.  One person's food did not come, and after we got our food two more people joined our group and ordered food.  These two people got their food before this person's ruben came.  Eventually his girlfriend went down to ask the kitchen for it because it had been an hour.  It had just been sitting there, and the waitress hadn't come and gotten it. We ordered another beer about this time, figuring we would be there while he ate his food.  He finished his food before the beer came so the next time I saw the waitress I asked her to cancel the drink order and bring the bill.  She took so long to come back to give change I walked downstairs to the bar to have them do it for me.  I stood at the bar and made eye contact with the bartender 3 times and he never came over to help me.  He also was not making drinks or talking to anyone.  He was just standing there on the other side of the bar."}
{"text":"I've been here a large number of times -- but only to play pool--(I've never had their food before). With that being said, this is my favorite place to play pool. We normally go on Wednesday nights (they hold trivia that time, but the tables are always open) and get a pool table and pitcher of beer right away. If you're playing at the tables, someone always comes around periodically asking if you'd like a refill on drinks and will bring it to you. It's a pretty good place to just have a casual night in general, you can also play darts or just watch sports on one of their many TVs. I'm looking forward to when it gets warm outside to spend time on their patio too!"}
{"text":"Great space, points for ambitious food that doesn't quite hit the mark, jackass regulars."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with work mates. Had the Cesar Wrap and a cup of chili. Wrap was great but chili was so. So. Service was ok. Not the most attentive waitress. Would try again."}
{"text":"I frequent this joint quite a bit for trivia night. It's always a fun time and the food and drinks are good. Service is always great, which is pretty hard to come by on trivia night.  Food is cheap and quality matches what you pay for.  Nice selection of taps and specials throughout the week.  Not a place to take out-of-towners, but somewhere I'd recommend if you're looking for a fun weeknight out."}
{"text":"The Brass Ring has quickly been growing on me to the point where it's probably one of my favorite bars in Madison now.  I just started frequenting it about two months ago and it has a lot to offer.  There is a bevy of pool tables so that it's almost a guarantee you'll be able to use one, the space inside is open allowing you to change-up what your doing on the fly without having to go somewhere else, and the beer selection is agreeable.  There's also a shuffleboard table that is in good shape and usually not overcrowded (like the ridiculous \"list\" system the Great Dane uses).  The atmosphere is good, but I think part of that is because I've usually gone with a group of 5 or 6 friends if not more.  There are a few cons though, despite the fact that I like it so much.  First, the patrons there are a mixed bag.  I don't like to judge other people, but it has a mix of trashy and cleaner looking people and I've heard of unsavory times there from friends of mine.  I personally haven't run into any issues, but you never know.  The bartenders are usually overworked and not very quick as others have mentioned, but if you snag a pool table it's usually not too big of a deal.  Parking can sometimes be a hassle, but there's a lot of street parking if your patient.  Lastly, the food isn't that great.  They give you big portions, but it's about as greasy-bar-food as it gets, and doesn't even taste that good.  I guess I could recommend the chili-cheese-fries, but it's generally better just to get drinks, play pool, and get friends together.  The Brass Ring's strong suit is it's open space, so invite a lot of friends and you're bound to have a pretty solid time."}
{"text":"I had the Irish pub nachos with chicken. This could be shared! Excellent!!! My husband had the chipotle burger, he said it was excellent. I had their house special old fashion, I'd pass on that one again. I've found the best place to get a great old fashion is on Sheboygan county. Any where else is disappointing, no extra fixings and a bit too bitter.  The food was great and they had a PBR tall boy special $2.75. The only real complaint was the lighting outside as in you can't see your food. It was 76 at 9pm, we wanted enjoy the warm weather.  The service was great!"}
{"text":"The place was just okay to me.  The pool players got kind of rowdy which was kind of a turn off.  The prices were a little steep as well, although the food was good, I feel like I paid too much for a couple of burgers.  The drinks were strong and the service was a excellent, so I will definitely be giving this place another try in the future."}
{"text":"Nice pool tables.  Shufflepuck.  Some tasty appetizers.  The atmosphere is a little bright for my tastes and barstaff has the annoying habit of overriding your  selections on the jukebox.  However, location and decent drinks and food make this a frequently stop."}
{"text":"We came in here for the pool tables. The pool ended up being kind of expensive so we settled for shuffle board. They had a decent beer selection. The bar has two floors and the second floor looks out on the first. There was also a pretty spacious outdoor area in front.   Icing on the cake was Naruto Vs Pain being on one of the flatscreens while Odesza played in the background. I'm like what!!!"}
{"text":"Came for Friday fish fry. For $11.95 i got a basket of fries, coleslaw and tarter sauce which was awesome. But the cod, 3 pieces that were maybe bite size at best. Super small portions. Will not be back for Fish Fry. To much competition."}
