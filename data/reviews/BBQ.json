{"text":"I didn't really eat there but I wanted to try it since I was staying around the block from this place. The place definitely looks nice and the people were friendly. The beer selection had newcastle which is always top choice of mine. The burgers looked really good. 

The poutine with pulled pork was ultimately our choice. It was good but not great. I believe that the pork wasn't seasoned well enough. ( I do like a lot of salt though.) The gravy also could've been spiced up a little. All in all the place wasn't bad and I would definitely check it out again. 

The good - the bread and spice rub.

The bad - the pork which was cooked to perfection just lacked seasoning."}
{"text":"First of all the name is misleading to anyone who knows anything about what we call BBQ in the US.  The waitress explained that it really is supposed to be a \"comfort food\" restaurant.  I had the only thing on the menu that even resembles BBQ (or comfort food) and it was truly awful--ribs that had been braised and were never near any smoke of any kind.   YUK!.   They came with no sauce on the side so I requested some and ended up with something that was very close to ketchup.

To top it off they had no draft beer (it was broken).  The bottled beer I asked for was back ordered and I was forced to drink a couple very weird beers one of which tasted like I was chewing on coriander.  

For an appetizer I had the onion soup which was very sweet and heavy with sherry.  Instead of cheese/ croûtons on top they give you a grilled cheese sandwich on the side. Not a bad sandwich but WTF?

My take on this place is they are trying to come-up interpretations of Southern comfort food without having ever experienced the originals.   They miss by a mile.

A couple of other things to mention.  I tried to book this place on line and they claimed no tables were available (which I was sure was incorrect since the place looked empty the night before).  I tried to call them directly but they didn't answer the phone.  Finally the hotel offered to help out and got through to them eventually.  I arrived and there were 2 or 3 parties in the restaurant the entire time I was there.  It was empty even though its been there less than a year.

To end on a positive note the women waiting on tables tried to be helpful and were quite nice.  I kind of felt sorry for them to be honest but they're probably sharp enough to know what's going to happen to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Mêmes proprios que Bar et Boeuf je crois. Essayé pour un lunch d'affaires. Peu de choix au menu mais le tartare/frite, classique, passait le test. Ambiance décontractée. Le fait que la cuisine et le comptoir soient séparées de la salle à manger n'aide pas le service hélàs, mais ça va."}
