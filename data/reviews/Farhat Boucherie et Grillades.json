{"text":"We were visiting Montreal last week and we found this place online, we got there and everyone was very nice, the place was clean and the food was awesome, the poutine was delicious  so as the grilled mix of meat( Chicken, Lamb and Beef), we definitely go back next time we are in Canada"}
{"text":"Farhat grills their meat on charcoal, which gives it a smokey, charred flavour. It is a growing chain, having a location in cote-vertu, the little Maghreb on Jean-Talon, and as every UdeM student knows, one in CDN. They serve sandwiches with either pita bread, or baguettes, and serves \"plates\" which has meat, rice, potatoes and the works.

I ordered a mergez sandwich combo, which has a slight harissa flavour, but I like my food on the spicier side so I ask for more. It was great, and I ordered a side of garlic sauce for my fries. The fries was kinda lackluster, soft and not crispy enough. They lost a star over this."}
{"text":"Farhat is a growing franchise that offers a variety of grilled meats and Arabic themed food. Their food is halal. 

I went with the grilled lamb sandwich and fattouch salad.

The charcoal grilled lamb was really good but I found myself not a fan of the garlic sauce which seemed to be based off sour cream? I like my garlic sauce to be strong but found their version quite light. Very good meat though, shame about the garlic missing the mark.

About the fattouch salad...what's up with the lack of pita? This should be a requirement for a fattouch salad. Also no tangy zest flavor, no lemon? Seemed the dressing was olive oil. Lots of bell peppers as well. Not sure what this was but it definitely wasn't a fattouch. More like a Mediterranean salad of sorts. Still good though... but just not what I expected. Huge portion.

Took about 10 minutes to have the food prepared since it was grilled fresh in front of you....which is fair. Service was good.

This being said, Laval has a lot of places that serve this kind of food and competition is fierce and unfortunately better if you're looking for a sandwich. My coworker felt the same way.

I would recommend coming here for the meats though. That's for sure."}
{"text":"Farhat charcoal grills and butcher shop is now open in Laval. Same great food from Cote des Neiges and Cote Vertu in a brand new place on Saint-Martin west in Laval.

I tried three sandwiches: kafta, soujouk and lamb chops and they're all amazing. Great selection of salads and sides. Must try for anyone who likes charcoal grills. They also have whole chicken grilled on charcoal.

You can also buy fresh meat to prepare at home. They have fresh meat with and without spices for those who want to make kafta or shish Taouk at home in the oven or on the grill.

They also have sweets for desserts.

All meat served is Halal.

No porc or alcohol are served in this place."}
