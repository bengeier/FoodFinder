{"text":"We went here to try their 18oz Porterhouse special for $24.95, which included soup/salad, and an apple dumpling with ice cream for dessert.  Service was good, we were asked many times how we are enjoying the food and kept drinks full. The ambiance was romantic and cozy all in one.   For the price, it was a great deal.  You are getting what you pay for here.  The steak dinner was well worth the price, but keep in mind, you are getting a $25 value steak here and you are not getting the best steak in your life for this cost.  They have other steaks on the menu which may gage better, but the dinner was good for the price and service was good to go along with it.  The apple dumpling was not so great, was kind of hard like it was baked too long.  Overall, I would suggest coming here to try this place out.  Downtown Vegas has great deals such as this hidden gem.    I would give this place a 3 1/2 stars if I could.  It is not quite a 4 but will have to note this as a 3 star."}
{"text":"On 9/6/14 we had reservations to dine at the Redwood Bar & Grill.  We've had numerous prior experiences there, and found this restaurant to be very good for food quality, price & service.  However, our recent experience is one to be forgotten, and never to return.  It started when we were seated in a booth.  Upon being seated when trying to read the menu, I noticed that all the lights along the top were non-functional, and we had nothing to light our table except one dimly lit table light about the power of a small penlight.  I asked the waiter if he would please turn on the overhead lamps so we could see the menu.  After a short absence, he returned to say that they were not working, and so basically, \"too bad\".  So, we proceeded to pass the table light around, and order our meals.  I had a ribeye steak, other individuals ordered the Atlantic Salmon, lamb chops, and shrimp scampi.  Comments to the food: my ribeye steak was just \"okay\" and nothing special.  It was actually a bit on the tough side, and not very tasty, but just ok.  However, when my sister got her shrimp scampi, it was COLD.  It was cold to the touch, and definitely had been sitting around the kitchen way too long before being brought to the table.  We immediately complained to the server, and she said, \"let me take it back, and heat it up\".  She took the dish back to the kitchen, to be heated up & brought back few minutes later.  It was a bit warmer, but it was still just \"luke warm\" and definitely not how a main dish should be served.  However, my sister decided against sending it back again, for fear that the kitchen staff might get upset, and do something \"bad\" to the dish.  In all my experiences dining at better restaurants, if there is something wrong with the dish(cold food inclusive), the dish was completely re-prepared and brought out fresh, hot & served to order, with an apology for the mistake.  As a matter of fact, many restaurants that I frequent at home would go one step further, and comp the meal as an offset to their mistake.  Neither action was taken by Redwood staff.  We also realized that the reason they could not heat the shrimp scampi back to piping hot was because the shrimps would then be \"overcooked\" and very tough.  So it seemed that the kitchen crew took the action of cheap, quickest fix, and least effort on their part.  For that reason, and our overall poor experience at the Redwood Bar & Grill, we will not ever return to this establishment.  Had they done anything to correct their mistakes, or even offered a sincere apology and made the effort to correct the food, we might feel differently.  Las Vegas has many restaurants that serve great food, and the service is good as well.  Redwood needs to do much better training of both kitchen & service staff, fix their physical facilities so everything works right, and teach their people how to graciously accept & correct any mistakes made in food preparation.  Hopefully, someone that has a sincere interest in RB&G will read this & take it to heart.  Aloha, Howard Y. from Hawaii"}
{"text":"Great place.  Has a really nice atmosphere.  I had the prime rib, and it was very juicy and tasty.  Soup was very good too.  Wait was pretty long, although we didn't have a reservation, so that might be why."}
{"text":"This place is a total hidden gem. Pineapple Shrimp was amazeballs!!!! Lamb and Ribeye cooked perfectly. Elarrio our server was on point with every step. BTW the best drink prices in Las Vegas. $9 Stoli Elit Martinis and Caymus for $80....and yes i did just say \"amazeballs\""}
{"text":"Hello, we went to this restaurant to celebrate our 17th wedding anniversary the service and the food we're good the food was especially good... we had the Porterhouse and the filet with king crab the steaks were cooked perfectly, the best New England clam chowder I've ever tasted... if you go there you have to try the hot seafood medley appetizer it is to die for, everything was very tasty, but we feel they could have made a bigger deal out of our anniversary ,I have a feeling people go there for special occasions ,too bad they don't have a program in place two make you feel special... the chairs were mismatched... it doesn't really bother me so much but it does look like they don't want to spend money on making things look consistent... and it does get a little crowded we had a hard time maneuvering are way out the door,I'm wondering if that is a fire hazard... anyway overall it was a good experience and we will be back"}
{"text":"Always great service.  Food is outstandingly delicious!!!!! Very nice ambiance. I do miss the live piano music though."}
{"text":"i have eaten here twice, both times had the 16oz prime rib. it is some of the best in town, but i had to rate this place only 3 stars do to the service. the first time i went the service was ok, but this second time it sucked and i had to write this review. first off my waiter comes over and asks if i want iced water or bottled water, i said no water just ice tea . then promptly brings over a glass of water and a glass of ice tea(by the way the waiters name was brian). no big deal, but just seemed weird to bring the water, next time brian just don't ask about the water. because you are given it to me no matter what i say. so, brian then takes my order and every thing seems to be getting on track. he brought some bread over fresh out of the oven. i sliced a piece off and was going to spread some butter on it but the rosebud shaped butter was hard as a rock, so no butter on my slice. oh well just bread no butter. then brian brings out my salad and asks if i wanted fresh ground pepper, i said yes, he then proceeds to go to the bar for what i thought was the pepper mill. as i am wanting i see him mulling around for a couple minutes then walks by my table with nothing in his hand, then i hear him say oh yeah. he then turns around to back to the bar and grabs the pepper mill. at this point i was still hoping everything would start get better. well i see brian carrying a tray towards my table and places it right in front of the table i can tell it's mine. but first he carries to salads to the next table, i am thinking that's fine it should only take about 10 seconds right? wrong, taking them over, he picks them both up and disappears into the kitchen. meanwhile my 16oz prime rib is right in front of me and i can't start eating it. minutes later brian comes out of the kitchen with two side soups for the next table. when you see something like that happen usually it's the guest changing their mind but i would have to say this time brian was wrong. finally brian comes back to my table uncovers an awesome prime rib and a sad baked potato. at that point my ice tea glass was empty but he got out of there like it wasn't his responsibility . so i finished everything, and it was good, not once did he come back and ask how's everything or refill my drink. after i was done eating waitng for the bill, i could not get brians attention he was to busy helping the bus boy straighten tables out only five feet from my table. then he finally come over and said are you done i said yes, then he goes  you want more ice tea. no i wanted it with my meal now i just want my bill. i don't know if brians is new and still learning customer service or that he just wasn't into serving tonight.  but i still would recommend the prime rib just hope you don't get brian as your server."}
{"text":"Horrific chicken--do not order. Steak was average but not bad. Fries were frozen, limp and tasteless."}
{"text":"There's a reason why they are famous for their prime rib cuts...they are really well prepared and moderately priced (about $25 for a huge cut).  The average age of the other diners (at least when we were there for a Sat. dinner) was around 50+...so don't expect the hip house music and hipster looking wait staff.  You go here for the steak and nothing else."}
{"text":"They open late for dinner. We arrived to Vegas around 10:30pm and wanted a good meal before heading to the craps table.   Had I known that the Prime Rib was going to be so HUGE, I would've shared mine!   Had the apple dumpling (Cinnamon infused apples, surrounded by flaky puff pastry, topped with rum sauce, served with vanilla ice cream) for dessert. The puff pastry was good -- not enough apples...and the ice cream tasted a bit odd -- my friend preferred the aerosol whipped cream instead! :P Rainbow sherbet was good -- refreshing after a huge meal."}
{"text":"Filet Mignon was tasty, had little crust, seasoned lightly and cooked to perfection!  Wastreated by my Dad, since, personally it's hard for me to enjoy a $28 steak meal (I'm cheap!)"}
{"text":"My finance and I has this place down as one of the places we wanted to try out while we were in vegas based on a friend's recommendation. Other than the wait, this place is hands down a good bang for your bucks for a fine dining steakhouse. My finance got their 24oz. Prime rib, which was juicy and tender. I got their porterhouse prix special for the day. The steak was okay but cant beat the price for soup, steak,& dessert for only $24. I would highly recommend anybody coming here to go for their juicy prime rib for a fraction of the price.."}
{"text":"We went here for Valentine's Day dinner. The place was packed with people.  Got to look at the menu. They had a Valentine's Day special three course menu.  They served us bread with an olive oil dressing with pesto inside. The bread was crunchy and fresh.  I ordered the house salad with honey ranch dressing. The salad was delicious. It came with a couple of cherry tomatoes.  Next was the Thai salmon and huge shrimp prawns. It also came with a rice pilaf. The salmon was under the prawns. It had a little spice to it. It also came with bokchoi and two carrots. The sauce was delicious and flavored the salmon and prawns well. I also found pieces of sliced portabello mushrooms inside. The rice pilaf was fluffy and light. I really enjoyed my meal.  After I was done with my main course, I waited for my dessert. I received a small piece of cheesecake with a strawberry with it. Presentation was nice. I ate the dessert up quickly since it was small.  Service was great. I even received a long stemmed red rose for Valentine's Day.  However, in the beginning I wanted an iced tea and my husband wanted Coke. They never brought us our drinks, so we just drank our iced water. My daughter got her apple juice. I really wanted my iced tea, but I guess it saved us some money. I was happy with the food, but the service could have been better. The waitress and waiter were nice and friendly. Overall experience was good."}
{"text":"20 year Vegas resident I Finally had a chance to dine here!  Comfortable atmosphere, service was amazing \"Jesus\" & \"Nikki\"  very friendly and accommodating! The food was great ! I ordered their famous macadamia nut crusted chicken, perfect portions and brought out very timely! My Wife had the sesame crusted ahi, be sure to order it rare, they suggested it that way, my Wife went medium,still pretty tasty, it probably would have been better rare, next time, definitely a next time! My friend  ordered the fillet w/ scampi, he was very impressed and he's a tough critic!   I would highly recommend this place!  Be sure to save room for desert, we went upstairs to Lappert's Hawaiian Ice Cream Shop!, Another one of my favorite's!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant in vegas. A hidden gem located inside California Hotel!  The food is great from the appetizer to the main course.  We would normally get the baked oysters,  escargot, or the half shell oyster.  Ribeye or lobster thermodori.."}
{"text":"Came in here with boyfriend on a Friday night with a reservation. We were early so sat at the bar for a drink - generous pours for sure! Then we got taken to our table. I asked what the soup was (clam chowder - amazing) and the whole time the server seemed to have an attitude about him with every word. Actually, when he walked away, I looked at my boyfriend and said \"so he's a bit of a pretentious fuck, huh?\" Boyfriend wholeheartedly agreed. It became comical at that point and we had a laugh about it but I could see another group getting offended. Back to the food: the oysters and dessert (German Chocolate cake) were forgettable. The soups (clam chowder and French onion) were outstanding, as were the entrees - my 8 oz filet was cooked perfectly and boyfriends 16 oz prime rib was incredible. Overall we would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I. Made a reservation for 10 at 8pm and we had to wait for 30 minutes. I normally don't eat downtown but friends were staying there. Last time I was there was 20 years ago when it was great.  Not anymore. Nothing special. Too bad."}
{"text":"Went there because we want a satisfying meel without paying an arm and a leg. Well we were not disappointed. I would not call this ace a bar and grill, I would call it more fine dining. The prime rib was the best I ever had, baked oysters amazing. Crab legs fabulous. Manhattan clam chowder yummy.  Filet and lobster perfect. Service was great. The only advice is to make a reservation, but worth the wait. And come hungry."}
{"text":"One of the best prime ribs I've tasted! So tender and came out rare as I ordered!  My 24 ouncer comes with garlic mash and veggies. Husband ordered their 16 oz porterhouse, it was very thin, comes with same sides AND dessert.  The Apple dumpling was warm, crust was nice and crusty, vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream paired perfectly with the dumpling.  We ordered a bottle of Sterling (only $24!!!) with dinner.  A wonderful experience and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The prime rib is sooo onos(for da Hawaii peeps). Kid friendly. We went there about 3x and we'll go there just for the prime rib and only when we have food coupons!"}
{"text":"Outstanding meal for wife's birthday celebration. Great steaks, lobster tail and salmon. Great service staff!  Casual yet elegant fine dining!"}
{"text":"Excellent prime rib. Sharing is a must unless you have the stomach of a horse. Side it with the garlic mash. Their bread is tasty. It is served with a pesto dip that is right on point. The service was great. Recommended."}
{"text":"The one big attraction here is..... more bang for the buck. This place will satisfy the appetite.  Steak was perfectly prepared.   Got tired of the buffet nonsense at the other hotels. Plus its inside the Californian Hotel and Casino what more do you want."}
{"text":"Stopped by after driving in for the weekend.  A friend had told me about the restaurant and I'm glad we went.  The restaurant has great low light, old Vegas feel.  The wait staff provided excellent service and appears to be team style and very attentive.  Each time you sipped your water or drink, they were there to refill.  We each ordered end cuts of prime rib, a side of mashed potatoes to share and salads.  The bread was delicious.  Slightly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The salads were decent.  The caesar hubs ordered was huge.  The house salad was fairly average.  I had the house dressing, french, which is not your traditional red/orange style.  It was white and contained honey.  It was good, just different.  Now, the meat.  Totally yummy and cooked perfectly.  We like end cuts well, which you shouldn't do, but these were awesome. Very flavorful and tender...and very big!  I'm sad I couldn't take my left overs, though there wasn't much left because it was so good.  The potatoes melted in your mouth and one order was plenty for both of us.  We skipped dessert because we gorged on meat and only had non-alcoholic beverages.  Total out the door $80 with tip.  Found out they have a $24 porterhouse special and includes soup/salad, accompaniments and dessert.  Can't wait to go back on our next visit."}
{"text":"Very good food for the price. Steaks are good - especially Prime Rib. The crab legs with melted butter are awesome. Nice fine dining location with reasonable priced."}
{"text":"The deep fried crusted Ahi was very poor quality. It was very stringy and could not cut it with a knife. I would recommend that not ordering this."}
{"text":"I always get the porterhouse special. Delicious porterhouse, choice of potato or steamed rice, salad/soup and apple dumpling for $29.99. The steak is grilled. The featured potato is in a wonton wrapper. The soups are homemade and are often seafood types. Also, you get sourdough bread. The restaurant is a favorite of my family for a long time."}
{"text":"Was just reading up on restaurant reviews and noticed that I had not posted on this establishment.  WTH??? Maybe postings drop off after two years or something??  In any event, I have eaten here maybe 50 - 100 times over the last 30 years or so.  I was there again this past Friday night and ate a little bit for dinner.  Started off with my standard double long pours of Maccallan 18 scotch, and had a small spinach salad.  Then the big (24 oz only now; when I started coming to this restaurant eons ago, the big cut was 36 oz.) prime rib - rare.  Had the steamed veggies too, but no starch -- no bread, no potato, no rice.  Everything was very good as usual, including the service from my favorite server that I request by name.  I ate all the spinach salad, but only about 1/4 of the prime rib -- took the rest home for my three kids (dogs) and they ate it for their dinner already.  No dessert cause I was full -- I cannot eat as much in my old age, but I did have two iced teas to drink.  I love this place, both for the food and for the service!"}
{"text":"I love how yelp can give such accurate ratings because I was super hesitant to dine here but trusted the rating. The food was spectacular! We went for Father's Day and had a reservation for 730 but wanted to eat earlier and they sat us right away so we were pleased with that! I can't remember our servers name but she was pretty good, no complaints there. Our runner jay who got our drinks bread and uncorked our wine for us (which we brought and corkage fee was only ten bucks which is a great price) was AWESOME. He truly went above and beyond to make sure all of our needs were met. My boyfriend had rib eye, I had the filet, both cuts were fantastic and cooked perfectly. The house potato was ok. Veggies and salad good. Bread and dipping sauce awesome and dessert was good:) all of it for 4 of us got out the door at 160 before tip. Super reasonable for the quality of food and service! Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"2.6 stars, 3 just for effort.  1 star for service. 4 stars for food quality. 3 stars for value.   Service was just horrible. Took forever to get service and in between courses, couldn't have taken longer. Once the check was due, took nearly 20 minutes just to close out.   Bread was good. French onion was good. Lobster Thermidor was excellent, again, service was horrible."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with the Rosewood Grille on the Strip, the Rosewood Bar and Grill resides in the California Casino downtown.  That's one place that after 28 years I'd never been to until tonight.  The Rosewood is a darkly paneled, richly lit, yet casual and unassuming place.  At the entrance you're greeted by a piano player and the bar looks inviting.  The dining room is on the small side, but doesn't seem crowded.  Our party of four all got the same thing: The Porterhouse special.  For $17.95, you get a baby green salad, 16 oz Porterhouse, mixed vegetable, 'garlic mashed potato,' and apple dumpling for dessert.  Julia and I both got the house dressing on our salad - honey french.  It was rich and delicious with just a bit of sweetness.  The greens were perky and fresh.  The main course was very good - the steaks were large but prepared well.  The cuts weren't the choicest of choice, but they were flavorful.  The mixed veggies were unremarkable.  The 'garlic mashed potato' were mashed potatoes wrapped in a puff pastry to resemble a clove of garlic.  Clever in presentation, but the execution of the flavor could have been better.  The apple dumpling was served with french vanilla ice cream and was absolutely delicious.  All in all, I've had better meals, but for the price this was definitely quite a steal.  The atmosphere was conducive for our two hour catch up session.  Not somewhere to take someone if you're trying to impress them, but a good place to have a meal with friends, old and new."}
{"text":"During my recent visit to downtown Las Vegas, I got a hankering for a quality slab of protein paired with a robust red wine. No surprise there! I became a bit discouraged as I perused the plethora of reviews on Yelp describing several high-end steak houses downtown that are highly rated but also very expensive. Then I found Redwood Bar & Grill located in the California Hotel & Casino. My fellow Yelpers swooned over the quality fare and reasonable prices. So off I went with a colleague in tow.  Upon entry, I knew Yelp had steered me to a good choice. What a classic! Dark wood, nice lighting, and that wonderful steakhouse aroma I love so much greeted us as we walked through the door. Although we had no reservation we were seated immediately (it was a Tuesday night in January after all).   One or two reviewers remarked on the generous pour cocktails. This was confirmed with my colleague's Jack and Coke and my Tom Collins.  (Whaaaat? Tom Collins??? I have to explain this. My wife and I watched Meet the Fockers the day before I left. Jack Burns loves his Tom Collins and I remarked to my wife that I had never tried one, but I would soon. Waitress at Redwood offers up a cocktail, seemed like the perfect opportunity, so I gave it a whirl. I didn't care for it.)  The menu offers a nice variety of meat and seafood options. A decent bottle of wine will cost a reasonable $35 or so depending on your choice. Most wines by the glass were priced at $8 to $10.  Given that we were both after beef, we were torn between the 16-ounce bone-in ribeye, the \"small\" 16-ounce prime rib, and the 18-ounce porterhouse special. I had the prime rib and my colleague had the porterhouse. If the prime rib cut was 16 ounces I'll eat my hat - it had to be at least 20. And it was one of the leanest cuts of prime rib I have ever eaten.  Served at perfect medium rare temperature along with green beans, rice pilaf, and fresh horseradish it was a bargain at $23.  All said and done, we enjoyed a splendid meal, great service, and a fine atmosphere for a total of about $84 including our meals, 3 cocktails, a glass of Kunde red zinfandel and a nice tip. Absolutely outstanding.  Thank you Yelpers! If it weren't for you I would never have found Redwood."}
{"text":"While in Vegas you do as the High Rollers do and eat at STEAKHOUSES! My original plan was to go to Hank's in Green Valley with my entourage but a few people did not have the correct attire...so we ended up at Redwood in the hotel lobby. I figured this place might be a little more upscale than the other restaurants in the Cal/Main ST property...but it wasn't. They do serve steaks and the usual steak house fare but no where close to the quality! If you've eaten at Pasta Pirate then you've basically eaten here! I love a bottled water for the table in Vegas (as most high end restaurants serve) but DASANI? LOL We ordered the Ribeye and Filet Mignon dishes but it was nothing special. If you took your date here she would probably laugh and walk out on you. The food wasn't spectacular but the service was great. Although our waiter had a bit of the sniffles and a cough. YUCK! Another GREAT this was 5 people eating and only $150! I love the pricing but you get what you pay for! If you can get a COMP...eat here and order the King Crab Legs plate! That was impressive and a mound of food!   1 star for Service  1 Star for Price...that's about all I can give!"}
{"text":"We arrived on time for the 7pm reservation, let the hostess know we were there and waited less than 10 minutes to be seated. The place was real old school with its decor, as it was very dark and drab like the old steak places from years ago. Cigar smoke was missing but proably not too long ago. It definitely needs a renovation but isn't likely to get one as its probably not financially feasible. The casino still uses some coin drop machines and is a downtown hotel, so it makes sense. Besides, it caters mostly to an older crowd who are usually comped for their meal as I was. Of the five tables I saw pay, only one paid cash.  I ordered the porterhouse special to share with my wife as its 16 oz, and we typically don't like to eat large meals. To add, we chose the sautéed mushrooms in a port wine Demi-glacé, the French onion soup, and Crab Wontons with a Chinese mustard sauce. The special also came with a mesclun salad with choice of dressing and a dessert of apple puff with vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce. Now, I will say since I don't have to pay cash for this place we will definitely coming back, but I will not order the porterhouse again, but will choose a regular steak off the menu like the filet or ribeye. Since the entire porterhouse special costs less than any individual steak entree I believe the quality of the porterhouse isn't prime. It had to be one of the worst porterhouse I've ever had--although the filet portion wasn't so bad, the strip side was tough. Another thing I couldn't understand was there was no seasoning on the steak at all. Which was surprising since everything else we ordered was--the French Onion Soup was probably the best I've ever had. It was covered with a tremendous amount of Gruyere, the most flavorful and largest crouton I have seen and was a huge portion. The mushrooms in Demi-glacé were also well seasoned and delicious, I used them bite for bite with the steak. I also felt a need to put some salt on the steak which I've never done. I was also appalled they asked if we wanted A1 or Heinz 57... Wife requested worsted shire which I use once in a while but didn't last night. Anyway, everyone around us seemed to be enjoying themselves, and mostly everyone I saw didn't have the Porterhouse, but Rack of Lamb, prime rib, filet or others. That should have been an indication, along with the fact there is no Porterhouse listed on the menu a la-carte, that that cut of steak isn't high a quality as their menu listed, full priced items. The server was nice but service was slow due to the amount of tables he had. Three of his tables had over 22 people combined. There were more I just lost count. The place was a bit stuffy and cramped and felt as if it was dusty, don't really know if that was true or my perception, but looking at all the fabric walls it would be amazing if it wasn't. Dessert was good, with excellent ice cream and a simple but tasty apple puff. My wife thoroughly enjoyed herself and considering the price was right, and whether I was comped or not was a plus. She said she would come back absolutely, if even just for the French onion soup. I would definitely come back for everything but the porterhouse special. I would go for the lamb rack, or the filet mignon, or maybe even the prime rib. Though I am not a fan of prime rib, they were huge, absolutely huge and from I have read here wonderfully tender. Definitely an item to share.  This would have been a 4 star rating but for the not so great Porterhouse. I will update, next time... See ya"}
{"text":"Totally forgot to do a review for this.  Anyways for a get together with the other workers we made reservations for this place. A bit fancy... I mean look at their butter! (http://instagram.com/p/buf1DGnt66/) Rose shaped, so pretty! Sad when I had to use it for my piece of bread.  To me, this place is expensive. The menu was limited...  Started off with a salad or soup. I got the salad.  I got the prime rib (http://instagram.com/p/bunqTjnt4j/). Yeah it's big, came with two sides. I got potatoes and vegetables. The size of the meat to my potatoes.. there wasn't enough. I'm not sure if it was the cook or the waitress's fault but my prime rib was cooked wrong. I asked for medium well and got medium. I am not one to complain but I guess I should have asked for it to be cooked a bit longer.  And if you're asking, \"Did she finish it?\" YES, yes I did. I wanted to sleep right after BUT, we got dessert (http://instagram.com/p/bus97rHtzK/).  There is ALWAYS room for dessert! We had two plates but I went for the one with chocolate. The brownie was really moist. I enjoyed the ice cream the most.  Service, MEH. The waitress we had stayed at one side of the table and those that were on the other end had to basically yell their order across the table. She also dropped our plates when placing it in front of us that it made clashing sounds. She also made the assumption that one lady that was with us was Filipino and started talking Tagalog to her but she was Chinese and didn't understand her at all. Shouldn't make assumptions, cause she was upset after.  I also tried different types of wine. I am not a wine person but it was nice to try some."}
{"text":"Sometimes you see more bradda, sistah, uncles, and aunties at this casino than you see at your hometown in Hawaii on any given day, but technically this casino is where it all started with the massive Hawaiian migration to Las Vegas.   I still remember back in late 1970's, when Sam Boyd would do his commercials for everyone in Hawaii and tempt them to visit beautiful downtown Las Vegas for 5 days and  4 nights for 199.99.   That was kind of nuts, because it was cheaper for everyone to visit Vegas than to visit another neighbor islands, and some ways it's still hold a lot of truth to this day.    Sam Boyd was a visionary, and knew to play on Hawaii's Asian cultural gaming history.     Even though, the Oxtail soup is legendary for this casino cafe, and has everyone lining up from 10:30 pm every night.  I have to give props to California hotel's Redwood Bar and Grill because it's been a favorite for a couple of generations of Hawaiians.  Not much has changed inside of the Redwood, and the dining room still has the feel of a old school Las Vegas steakhouse.  It's kind of dark, but the overhead lights above the table gave me enough lighting to take picture with a flash.  Service was good, and attentive, and my glass of water never went below half full.     I have give their French onion soup a big thumbs up, but it's not too hard blow that dish, and this came with the 24.99 Porterhouse steak special.    The steak was a pretty good size 20 oz cut, and it came with a very nice loaf of crusty bread, two sides, and dessert.   Damn, I was stuffed after that meal, and it was well worth the money.      If I was going to impress a date, I wouldn't bring her here because I would run into someone I know, and then talk story time would take off more than a few times before leaving the front casino doors...Sorry, but it always happens; but for a bunch of friends and family from Hawaii, it's more than good enough if you don't want to leave downtown and dine in at a steakhouse for this price point.   I would give Redwood bar a 3.75, not quite a fan, but I still like it."}
{"text":"i meant to go to pasta pirate but they closed early because they are slow. they offered us a free drink for the inconvenience but i didn't want to drink so i just ordered something simple. me and my friend decided to split a meal which usually would be easy. the meal comes with salad or soup so i asked the server to just change it to one salad, a Caesar salad because that would be for me and not my counter part.. he then brought two and later charged us for them. it's fine, maybe i didn't make myself clear. the meal then made up for everything. the lamb was perfectly seasoned. and wasn't too tough. i dipped the rice in the steak juice and it was perfection. they even offered us a free dessert to make up for everything. we decided to get the creme brulee.  pricy for sure. i wouldn't go back on my own."}
{"text":"It may have been good but we could not get seated at 6pm for dinner. The only seating offered was in a dining area that had the electricity and lighting that was NOT working, no joke. An entire section of overhead lighting over 4-6 tables was not working and we could not see the small print menu or my food if I had ordered. They had other tables available that did have electric lighting but would not seat us there as they had already reserved those available tables they said. But No reserved signs on those tables to indicate that. The hostess was constantly talking to what appeared to be her friends at first contact at the entry podium, and they had to signal to her we were there as her back was to us for a while as we waited to try to be seated. No apologies from her about the electric or lack of service offered. Glad we moved on another restaurant."}
{"text":"We tried Redwood recently and were all, unfortunately, underwhelmed.  Things started off well enough as we were quickly served water, and a delicious bread with a light olive oil, basil & parsley dipping sauce. Our waiter was very friendly, and did not thumb his nose at us for bringing our own wine ($10 corkage fee is a good ideal).   - Appetizers.  My salad was good, but nothing special. The better .05's seafood soup was really bad - tasting like it came from a can.  - Entrees. The Porter house steak was cooked correctly and was OK. The accompanying green beans were excellent, the mashed potatoes not so much. The cioppino was lackluster, with an odd flavor and the crab legs were not pre-cut, making it very difficult to eat and a lot was wasted.  - Dessert. Pumpkin pie was good. The best dish of the night was the Apple Dumpling with ice cream  - Service. Started off great!  But when we ordered, our menu questions were brushed aside - like he did not have time to answer them. Then it took a LONG time to get our bill and finally get my CC back.  Hoping this was just an off night, as we really like the CAL casino!"}
{"text":"There's nothing like getting the girls all dressed up and fancy and going out for the night!  Our night started with a delicious steak dinner at Redwood :)  We picked this place based on the reviews, and I can definitely see why people like it so much.    I had the filet w/ a baked potato as my side and I added on French Onion Soup.  It was honestly some of the best french onion soup I have ever tasted.  I would go back for just that!  My filet was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned.  The baked potato was...well, a baked potato ;)  Nothing too exciting there.  Our waiter was SO friendly, though.  He was nice, prompt, and got us anything we needed.  I really appreciated how fast and courteous he was!  I would definitely go back again! :)"}
{"text":"This is seriously one of the top steak dinners I've ever had.  Coming from Nebraskan that eats copious amounts of steak, that's quite a compliment.  When we come to Vegas, this is a definite stop for us, every. single. time.  The ambiance, the food, the service.  My buddies and I could stay here for hours, easily.  The porterhouse special is fantastic.  Everything has always been cooked to perfection.  They know what they're doing, and they do it awesomely.  The steaks are huge, they do not skimp here.  You get what you pay for and then some.  Seriously.  I'd plan a Vegas vacation around this place."}
{"text":"Always love coming here during vacation. The porterhouse special is my go-to meal! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The porter house steak was awesome it just melts in your mouth.. and the dessert was Apple dumplings with vanilla ice cream everything was good..."}
{"text":"I've searched high & low, there's nobody who does their lobster tail like this place. It's a big portion of fresh & tender filet of lobster without the shell, just the way I like it. And you gotta have it with house potatoe wrapped in wonton wrap. It's to die for!! I drive 4 hours to vegas just to eat my favorite lobster here, 'cus it's done right!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner Monday night, we were seated right away, our waters were filled right away and were given a bread loaf with whipped butter and seasoned olive oil to dip the bread. The warm bread was delicious with the soft butter but was 'kicked into notches unknown' (as Emerald would say) with the olive oil. They have a special which is not listed on the menu, it has a 24 oz steak, salad or soup and apple dumpling served with vanilla ice cream & caramel sauce for $24.00. We both ordered the special, I had salad & my hubby got the lobster bisque soup. The salad was fresh and plenty of dressing (lettuce, tomato & cucumber), the soup was very good according to my hubby, our steaks were cooked to perfection served with mashed potatoes and and sautéed yellow squash & broccoli. There was so much food, I couldn't finish any of it except for my dessert which was so good. The service was good and we thought it was really awesome when the chef came out and introduced himself and made sure we had a great meal. Redwood Bar & Grill exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Best dang Prime Rib I have ever tasted.  I split one and still have food left over.  The meat is like butter and almost dissolved in your mouth.  It is the tastiest meat I have ever had and the prices arent bad.  21 for 16oz and 27 for 24 oz.  A definate place you will come back to.  Go eat there and if you don't enjoy it, you must not have taste buds."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant we hit when we got to Vegas, my friends dad loves this place, the waitress knows him by name and was wondering when he was coming in again so we were pretty much taken care of, I had the prime rib and it was awesome, it melted in my mouth, and it was cooked perfectly to my preference. We also were drinking red wine, not sure the name but it was really smooth and went really good with the prime rib. What made this establishment a place I really liked is how friendly they were and we will come here again!!"}
{"text":"It's back to 4 stars. Our waiter Jose was very attentive, so were the busboys. Very impressive.  This time I had Macadamia nut crusted chicken w/ shrimps,  Mom had Fillet Mignon with Lobster Tail.  My chicken dish had a great sauce, however, the breaded crust was totally separated from the chicken as I cut into the dish..  A fine chef should be able to do a better job on sticking the breaded crust to the meat. However, it's tasty enough, no complaints.  Mom's dish was great, it had a decent size fillet Mignon  and lobster. I know both ingredients were expensive, however, for $52.00 It looked a little boring and overpriced. Don't get me wrong though, they were tasty, just felt a bit overpriced..  We go to Vegas every few months, and have always stayed at either California or Main Street. Have been doing so for over 20 years now. So this is probably the fanciest restaurant we would go during our stays..  It means a lot to us if it's good, so we won't have to journey out of these 2 casinos for better food.  This time around, good enough.. We'll stay inside on our next visit."}
{"text":"I would have to rate this one of the best dinners I have ever had. The \"Special\" was amazing. Huge steak with sides, soup or salad and top it off with dessert.  It is located inside of an older Vegas casino off of Freemont. I was not so sure of what the meal would be like considering it was older and competing against the new and modern casinos.  It took me by surprise on how well the staff treated us and how absolutely delicious the meal was. We drove in from Phoenix for the night and I am definitely going back and have been raving about Redwood to those heading to Vegas. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Disappointed! Been there before loved it...tried to make reservation for parents anniversary for a week by calling during business hours but nobody picks up.  I decided to call the front desk and then said sorry but you can do it here but we have nothing until 830pm.  My parents are almost 80 and we can not have them wait until 830...so disappointed that website says call number but no answer"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. This was my first steakhouse experience and I enjoyed it very much. I had the Porterhouse special which was awesome (Especially the price $24. Wow! Right?). Old Vegas feel. Just what I was looking for. Wait staff were amazing. Very attentive. All in all a good time I would say. I will definitely be coming back. Next time I'll bring friends."}
{"text":"Good value, good food.  Good value brings in the older crowd."}
{"text":"I just flew in from the Bay Area and my husband has been waiting for me to try this place and see what's all the hype about.. Service was great.. Tho we didn't have reservations we were seated immediately after standing at the hostess booth waiting for about 5min while the hostess was at the bar till she noticed us. While being seated we were asked bottled water or ice water then were giving bread which was not so bad.   Appetizer--- shrimp cocktail 3jumbo pieces pretty good.. & crab cake the veggies were chunks they weren't minced well and came out in a shape of a ball and the middle was COLD.   Entrée--- I got the 10 ounce fillet mignon I asked for it medium rare it came out well done it was dry and tough!! the veggies weren't fresh tasted like its been frozen in a bag then thawed out and boiled, mashed potatoes was wrapped in a wonton ball it tasted OLD! My husband had the salmon it was the worst it was so rubbery with no flavor tasted like it came right out the freezer and cooked in the microwave the veggie and mashed potatoes were the same. As we were leaving we saw 2 other salmon that were on a caddy cart that had been half eaten.   All and all service and atmosphere was nice but the food was terrible for what we paid.. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Don't go out of your way to eat here. If you are looking for a good steakhouse, stay far away. Yelp reviews for this restaurant is misleading.  Ordered prime rib cooked medium. Came out rare. Sent it back to get cooked more, still came back rare again, but we just ate it anyway. Waiter never came by to ask about it. Rare would've been fine if it was a high quality cut.  New York was cooked right but dry and low quality, bland.  You get what you pay for. If you're gambling here and need a quick steak fix, this might do it. Otherwise, keep walking."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! I was surprised to find such a great steakhouse inside California hotel where I've been a long patron of a dining place next door called Market Street Cafe.  Elegant and sophisticated atmosphere with 5 star service. We made a reservation earlier in the day so we were seated immediately after walking in.   Things tried:  Baked oysters ($14): Baked with spinach, bacon and parmesan cheese. Simple dish, perfect appetizer. Cheesy and good. 5/5  Fresh oysters on half shell ($14): 6 pieces of succulent oysters with cocktail sauce. Oysters were fresh and good 5/5  French onion soup ($7): Layers of sourdough toast with melted Swiss and parmesan cheese. It was served in a beehive looking dish which I liked. Soup itself was good. Lots of cheese so it can be filling. 4/5  Filet Mignon ($30): Probably the most expensive meat here for 10oz at $30. I just assumed it was the best out of all and it was! Tender & juicy. Although 10oz, it felt like a generous cut. 4/5  Roast prime rib ($26): Generous and huge 16oz cut which was bigger than my face. They have even bigger cut, 24oz, called Redwood cut which I assume is for some carnivorous mammal? Server was kind enough to get me a fresh horseradish for my prime rib. Tender, juicy, meaty. Order if you want a delightful experience of meat heaven. 4/5  I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Great value for well prepared steakhouse fare served up with all the flourish you would expect."}
{"text":"Excellent dining inside The Cal Casino/Hotel! Had oysters, steak and crab legs. Yes, I know the joke, \"Do you have crab legs?, well keep your pants on and I won't tell anyone\".....Ba-da-bing!  Anywho, the Redwood Bar & Grill is a great place to splurge when celebrating a special occasion, or after winning a big jackpot inside the casino.... Oh yeah, you have to order the baked oysters, AMAZING!  Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"How Rude!  My boyfriend and I called ahead to check if the closing time was accurate (at 10!) to the information given on yelp. The woman on the phone confirmed that the closing time (11pm) was correct. When we arrived at 1030. We stood in the front waiting for a host while a woman and a man sitting diagonally from us stared while consuming their meal. Once the host arrived he proceeded to seat us but was interrupted by the woman eating with \"we're closed.\" I don't understand why that women didn't have to courtesy to tell us that during the whole time we were standing there!!!! She was so rude and if she was the one who confirmed the closing time than I am ever more disgusted. After the horrified look on my face, the host explained that they close early if it is not busy. THEN WHY DIDNT THEY SAY THAT WHEN WE CALLED???? Unbelievable."}
{"text":"This is how Fremont Street does steakhouses!  Inside the California Hotel, I've been here twice now, and this is my place to get a steak in Las Vegas without the glitz and glam of The Strip and of course the price.  This is how I feel the Rat Pack did things.  Treated like royalty in an old school atmosphere with 10 of my friends for my bachelor party.  Everybody said they enjoyed their meal whether it was the porterhouse special, bone-in rib eye, or the 10 ounce fillet.  We also enjoyed some cheesy baked oysters, and a good quality bottle of red wine.  Top notch service, top notch food, and just a chilled, but could be made romantic if you want it place."}
{"text":"Took the parents out to dinner and this was opened on the Monday that we were there at CA Hotel.  Ordered the Rib-eye medium rare and baked potato.  Everything was delicious, but dessert...I know!  I ordered the Creme Brulee.  The custard was too thick, it wasn't creamy and the caramelized sugar on top was greasy.  No bueno."}
{"text":"Fancy restaurant. Somewhat upscale. Perfect to come in after a wining night at the casinos! Or if you simply want steak. We were a group of 8 with no reservations and got seated instantly.  Greeter asked if we had reservations and when we said no he said he would still help us out. Although they can only seat  4 at a table they still placed us close by each other."}
{"text":"One word: Amazing!  Awesome customer service. Our waiter was Jesus and he was super nice.  Most of us got the porterhouse steak which was delicious! It was a large portion for $24.   I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"If you didn't know it was there, which I didn't, you'd probably just walk right by the wooden facade and single-door. We went there since I was the only newbie and we needed to grab a nice dinner before making the torturous middle-of-the-night drive back to LA, after having been in town for less than 24 hours.   I guess they were having a rough night, with us having to wait 20 minutes for a table when it wasn't full and the hostess having to wipe down tables. But she was extremely nice and so was our waiter who did the little things that matter. Like bringing us buttered up white bread, and a small sample of their other soup when someone at the table showed interest. I had the oysters on the half shell (half dozen) which were fresh, and then I got the lamb chops, which were surprisingly flavorful and cooked just right. The crab legs came in a huge pile and I think it says something when you're at a table with three guys and they couldn't finish the plate. Entrees ranged from $20 to $40 or so, but really good relative to the amount of food that you got. I would definitely eat there again next time I'm at the Cali."}
{"text":"We came in here looking for a steak dinner that didn't cost us a limb, but wasn't the gamble of a $4.99 steak dinner at an off-strip casino.  Thankfully, Yelp pointed us this direction and I'm glad it did!  Was it more than we would normally pay for dinner out?  Yes, at $85 with tip, it certainly was, but we also don't eat filet mignon every day, so it was worth it.  We each got the petit filet, I with baked potato and he with this awesome little garlic mashed potato pouch thing that I may have to get next time. We also ordered some amazing asparagus and an order of mushrooms in a garlic wine reduction.   I'd asked for \"medium\" and my steak was so pink it was almost red -- so in other words, perfect. It was delicious. At 8oz I couldn't finish it but enjoyed the rest the next day in some breakfast tacos. FANCY.   We were too full for dessert, but their selections looked amazing.  Only downsides: the side of seasonal vegetables that came with our steak was fairly sad -- really, really, REALLY soft mixed squash and carrots. Wasn't really a fan of that.  Also, we sat for 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us and we had to go back to the hostess to remind them we existed.  That seemed unusual, though.  There was some kind of server mix-up, but once they sorted it all out, we had wonderful service.  Props to Ray, Hilario and Jesus.  The atmosphere isn't quite as nice as the price suggests. Sure, it's clean and tidy and there's nothing wrong with it, but it feels kind of like a dark, nice Coco's.  It doesn't have that intimate \"steak house\" feeling.   I'd definitely go again, though -- I'd love to try some of their other things."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp because my husband and I love prime rib and filet minion . This place is in old Las Vegas at the California hotel.  We made out reservation on open table . I suggest you do the same for no waiting. My husband ordered the 30 oz prime rib and I ordered the petite filet minion 8 oz. The bus boy and server were very good. We did not have room for dessert, however they did have the desserts they offer on a display!  I love that ! No one ever does that anymore . Please come by and check this classy place out !"}
{"text":"To quote Bette Davis, \"What a dump!\"  The California Hotel's Web site makes this dark, dingy hole in the wall look like an elegant choice for dining downtown.  Don't be fooled.  I only stay at the best hotels and eat at the best restaurants when in Vegas. But I thought the prices were very good and this would be a good choice for one of my favorite dishes, prime rib.  Well, you get what you pay for.  First, the food: Caesar salad was very mediocre, equal to those salads in a bag from the supermarket.  Oysters were also blah - had much better.  Worse, the prime rib arrived barely warm and was not up to snuff. And it was drowned in au jus.  I felt like I was eating lukewarm prime rib soup.  The right way to serve this is with a small amount of jus on the side.  This place just does not seem able to get anything right.  Most infuriating was the service.  I ordered a glass of wine with my steak and our waiter then disappeared for a good 20 minutes.  Had to summon a different server to complain.  By the time I got my wine, I was done with the prime rib.  Downtown is seedy, and in that respect, the Redwood Grill fits in perfectly.  I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for a decent steakhouse in the area, and heard about this place as well as saw Yelp's 4-star average rating.  I called the number that showed up on Yelp, which is actually the number for the California Hotel & Casino instead of the direct restaurant's number.  I didn't know and asked if they still took reservations (it was late afternoon on Black Friday so I thought it'd be crowded) and the hotel employee rudely asked, \"For what?\"  I soon realized it was the hotel and told her I was looking for the Redwood Bar and Grill and she transferred me without saying anything.  Note to self: Never stay at this hotel.  Anyways, I got the hostess on the phone and made reservations for 8:00p, which was the first available for a party of 10.  BTW, this hostess was rude too.  When I told her that I would take that 8:00 time, she didn't acknowledge or say anything.  There was a brief silence, so I asked her if I should give her my name now and her response was a sarcastic \"That would help.\"  So we get there maybe 10 minutes before 8:00, and was told that we'd have to wait another 15~30 minutes because there was still a party of 16 waiting to be seated.  AYFKM?  Talk about bad planning, miss thang.  I don't remember her apologizing for the wait either.  We ended up having to kill time at the arcade upstairs (for the kids) as the others went gambling.  We came back around 8:15, and the hostess was gone.  We waited in the front for at least 30 minutes without any acknowledgment from anyone.  Then we FINALLY get seated around 9:00, without any apologies.  That's when the bitchy hostess went back to her post in front as we sat at the table inside.  I guess she was hiding from us this whole time.  Although we got seated, we had no menus and no one came by for maybe 5 minutes.  Our server then came to get our drink orders so we asked him for menus and all he said was \"Give us some time, we'll get to it.\"  My sister actually got up and asked the hostess for menus, and for the first time (from any of the workers), I heard her say \"Oh, I'm so sorry about that.\"  Well, I have to say, the food here is pretty good.  I ordered a petite filet mignon (8oz) that came with a salad and choice of either garlic mashed potatoes, baked potato, or rice pilaf for $25.  Our server was nice once we got our drinks, and the chef came out to greet us and asked if our food was good.  There's no kids' menu, so I ordered my kids the French onion soup ($6) and crab cake (2pcs for $13), which they shared.  I would've given this place 4 stars because the food is pretty good AND it's affordable (have you seen the prices at other steakhouses?!), but because the service that we experienced up until getting our food was TERRIBLE (yes, it deserves all caps), I knocked off a star.  If it weren't for the food, I don't know if I'd give them one star."}
{"text":"Right smack in the middle of the Cslifornia Hotel.  Lots of Aloha.  Lots of Locals (Hawaiian) Lots of Love.   A block from the lights of Fremont Street lies the California Hotel. As close to Hawaii you'll get in Vegas.   A $28 Porterhouse Steak Dinner hit my attention. Soup/salad, 18oz steak, bread fresh from the oven and an apple dumpling  w/ice cream dessert capped a fine dining experience.   We also has a petite fillet, Baked Oysters, and a Maker's Mark Manhattan.   Both steaks were a big overdone. A bit dry on the outside.   Oysters were good, but seemed to be missing a bit of oyster in each. Shrinkage?  The dessert was awesome.   Service prompt and friendly.   Oh. The horseradish.  I ordered it straight, not cut with sour cream.  Boy, that was the hottest I have ever had!  Ever!  I like it hot, but that was \"blow the top of your head off!\" Kind of hot!  The rest of the menu looked good. Couple next to us had crab. Looked like they enjoyed.   Will return and order rare."}
{"text":"Decent food and decent service.  A good value for your money."}
{"text":"FINALLY - a reasonably priced yet still classy steakhouse in Vegas! I was starting to feel like there was no middle ground in this city, it's either a risky $5.99 prime rib special or an uber fancy $70 a head steakhouse ... but that was until I discovered the Redwood!  Talk about a deal!! Here's a nice setting, with DELICIOUS steaks, and only around $30 per person - that includes alcoholic beverages!!   My prime rib was incredible. I highly recommend it. Just a heads up, we arrived around 8:30pm on a Saturday night and there was a 45 min. wait - but don't be deterred, the hostess allows you to leave and comeback, so hit the bar for a few cocktails and prepare your gullet for a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"During a recent trip to Vegas, I once again trusted yelp for my dinner options and it stirred me in the A-1 direction!    Redwood Bar and Grill had top notch service, warm ambiance and an outstanding variety of food choices.  SImply Delightful!  Being on a limited diet, I opted for the Roasted Chicken - the best I have ever had in a chicken dish!  My husband went the whole nine yards for their prime rib special (22 oz).  He found it cooked medium well to perfection and managed to finish all but a tiny portion.  The potato and veggies that accompanied the dinner were cooked and seasoned wonderfully and the check did not break your wallet!  I'd highly recommend this little gem located in the California Hotel!  Don't miss out on a trip over during your vacation in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Friends and I were in town visiting Vegas for a fun adult trip. The last night we were in downtown Vegas and wanted to eat a nice dinner. We ended up at Redwood Bar and Grill.   When we arrived the hostess let us know they were pretty booked on reservations, but could squeeze us in within an hour or two. We instead asked if we could sit in the lounge/bar area. She was happy to let us sit there and we had a nice little area where the six of us had our own personal mini table. The bartender Nelson quickly greeted us and took our drinks. They typically don't sit a larger party in that area for a full dinner service, but he mentioned he would make it work.   The menu had a variety of dishes from salads, to steak, to chicken, or seafood - good for anyone! The prices were great and very affordable for Vegas. I decided to go with the Filet Mignon with Garlic Mashed Potatoes. The steak came out perfectly cooked and seasoned. The meat was very tender, and the mashed potatoes were delicious! It was a very high end meal for an affordable price.  Nelson was a fantastic server and bartender! We would definitely recommend stopping in Redwood Bar and Grill if you're in the area and want a great meal."}
{"text":"The food is superb and the service is beyond awesome. Our server Daren  and Nicky were very attentive. Will defnitely be coming back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"after a couple bad steak experiences at the steak house  and golden steer i.e.: overpriced and over hyped, went back to the Redwood Grill, Californian. Took my Mom and Dad there before remodeled but all the touchstones, and nice remodel still there. Prime rib perfection.  Higher ceiling improves noise and windows allowed a filtered evening light so not claustrophobic. Just a pleasant evening and prices were reasonable. If seek good quality, staff, and not a buffet.. less than the \"strip's\" steak experience  prices.  and  Then you can stroll Fremont..."}
{"text":"Great deal for the price you pay despite some minor flaws, service is fast and friendly, the environment is dark which is classic for steakhouses.  The porterhouse special is a screaming bargain at $24, comes with the works, soup or salad, the main meal is a large porterhouse with the fixings and dessert.  Highly suggest that you order it medium rare because the quality of the steak is ok only so medium could be too tough and dry.  Also, they don't season the steak, so you should ask for A-1 sauce or have the server season with fresh pepper and salt.  Otherwise, the steak looked great with the elegant grill marks and have a nice smokey grill flavor.  Also suggest you make reservations as the restaurant could be very busy at times."}
{"text":"Staying at the Cal we usually go to the Redwood at least once on our trip. This time I think our waiter was busy. When we first got there we were greeted and we ordered but after that our waiter never came back. My mom and I got the filet and lobster. My daughter and I shared. When we were done eating we waited for a while the just asked the lady busing the tables if we could order dessert. She brought the dessert and the waiter only came to our table to bring the check."}
{"text":"French Onion Soup, Redwood Cut of Prime Rib, Chilean Sea Bass and Apple Dumpling were the bomb. Our servers Darren and Aurelio were awesome. They made our early anniversary dinner special even though they did not know it was a special occasion. We will be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner while I was on a trip with my boyfriend and the food was amazing. I had the Macadamia Nut Chicken and it tasted absolutely heavenly. My boyfriend had the prime rib served with a side of rice and he absolutely loved! He didn't know that it was going to be a huge slab, so he ended up taking the rest back to the room. I wanted to try the crab legs but I didn't want to get messy since the reservations were also with my boyfriends company. Next time I come here, I'm definately trying it!"}
{"text":"This was our first time and wanted to try something new. My salmon was under cooked and flavorless and my guys 30.00 filet mignon was bland. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"My wife treated me to dinner here for a date night and I must say it was a very good choice.  We've been once before, but only for happy hour drinks and an appetizer in the bar.  This time it was for the full meal.  My wife had a surf-and-turf like plate with crab legs.  Mine was the prime rib.  The prime rib was a rather generous portion and tasted great.  I was more than happy to take my uneaten portion home to have the next day (it kept rather well overnight).  My wife's filet was good (not great) but she says her crab legs were amazing.  We've already recommended Redwood to a few of our coworkers for a nice meal out that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Our steaks were cooked to perfection. The service was phenomenal. Thank you for a wonderful dining experience.  It is experiences like this that keep us coming downtown."}
{"text":"Awesome steak at a great price.  Reminds me of a Rat Pack steakhouse with an Hawaiian flair."}
{"text":"Should have listened to the reviewer that said very mediocre. King crab was half warm half still refrigerator cold. Wait staff nice but inattentive. Very expensive for what you get. Over cooked veggies that were once frozen, and nasty wonton wrapped mashed potato that tasted like old glue. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely FANTASTIC !!!!  The service was great only to be outdone by the food. We had the porterhouse special @ $24.95 which came with bread, salad, two sides and dessert.  The only downfall was that it was downtown at the California. I happened to be staying on the strip, yet if I were staying there it would get 5 stars. This place would do well at Monte Carlo or MGM"}
{"text":"Nice steakhouse restaurant within the California Hotel Casino. My friend and I decided to splurge a little, since we did pretty well at the poker table earlier in the day (plus I felt like having lobster!). The restaurant had a fine dining feel to it, dim low-lighting atmosphere complete with waiters in tuxedos.   Our waiter was very attentive and and the service was great. However, we did have a  busboy that kept coming around our table to talk to us about how he loved the menu, which wine he prefers,etc. It was a little uncomfortable because he kept interrupting us during out meals.   I had the shrimp cocktail appetizer while my friend Kristl ordered the French Onion soup. She mentioned that although the soup was pretty ono, it was a little on the salty side.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r9pcdBvf2wc6sIZP8DVIIw?select=6jeiOBt6jjyIPGFH3eW9wA  The crab wontons we shared was pretty standard: the usual cream cheese type filling, not worth the $10.   For entrees, Kristl ordererd the \"Redwood Cut\" 24oz prime rib. She said it was probably one of the best she's had. Perfectly cooked and flavorful au jus. I'm not big on steaks, but after trying a bite myself I had to agree with her. It's was cooked to the requested med rare temp and the meat just melted in my mouth! \"Like buttah!\"  I had the Lobster Thermidor with mixed veggies (didn't want any starch).  It wasn't exactly the usual LT that I've had in the past, I was used to having it grilled & topped with a crunchy parmesan cheese/bread crumbs crust. Redwood's was on the richer, creamier side. The shelled lobster tail was sauteed with shallots, mushrooms, sherry, parmesan and cream, then placed back into the shells. It was topped with, you guess it - more parmesan cream! Heaven on a plate! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r9pcdBvf2wc6sIZP8DVIIw?userid=lsSiIjAKVl-QRxKjRErBeg  Our bill came out to about $160 with appetizers, entrees, desserts and a bottle of white wine. Not a bad deal at all in my opinion."}
{"text":"I had dinner there last night at the recommendation of a friend staying at the same hotel. This place was probably the best dinner I've EVER had or pretty darn close. I sat the the bar with two wonderful bartenders Mat and Nelson. They really made myself and everyone else sitting there feel like the appreciated your coming in and made you feel like an ole friend. Thank you so much for this wonderful experience and I WILL be back next time I'm in town. Until then cheers!"}
{"text":"As a visitor, I had heard of this joint, but never tried. As a resident, it is our go to place when we are downtown for a show. Very good lamb, steaks and prime rib. Full meal deal which is a refreshing change from the spendy and trendy ala carte steakhouses that abound in Las Vegas.  Quiet place and nice to see our old Hawaiian neighbors dining at the Cal. No pretense...just ONO."}
{"text":"I went there with a group of 11 last Sunday night.  I thought the bread was outstanding,  the house salad with their honey-french dressing was good.  I would order the dressing on the side next time since they do put a big glob on the greens.  I ordered the 16 oz prime rib [there is also a larger 24 oz cut] medium rare and it came out excellent.  I was pretty hungry, however I still could not finish this thick boneless prime rib.  I am not sure if they have considered offering a smaller, maybe 12 oz. portion but that would have been perfect for me.  The sides of veggies and baked potato were very good.  Prices are very competitive with good steak houses, I would have thought it would be more expensive to eat here.  Will definitely go there again when I at the Cal Club."}
{"text":"We visited redwood because we heard the prime rib rivals lawrys. The food was yummy, we had appetizers, prime rib, salads etc. there was a party of five and although we had reservations we still waited nearly an hour to be seated. So I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars mostly for the wait. And not sure why the service was so slow. Were  there not enough wait staff? The service wasn't bad, just slow. Will we go back? Probably. And maybe the service will be better."}
{"text":"Tender Yummy Filet Mignon is always the best here. I love it as it is like butter. meat is yummy and super soft."}
{"text":"After all these years, this place is still rock solid.  The beef here is Prime so it's as good as any other steak house short of any place serving wagyu.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  We always stop here on every trip."}
{"text":"We try and visit every time we're in LV and it never disappoints.  The \"steak special\" is great with fabulous bread, great salad, large (18 oz) beautifully prepared Porterhouse steak and the simple, yet soooo good apple dumpling with ice cream.    I can long for the days  when this \"special\" was $10.00 (and included shrimp in the salad and I think soup too), but this dinner at $24.00 is still a great bargain.  The only negative is that we have the steak special as a tradition and miss out on some of the other great things - onion soup, prime rib, etc.  We always think next time we'll go ala carte, but haven't yet.  The service is friendly, welcoming and professional - a great combination.  It's not a Morton's or a Palm or even Ruth's Chris, (and not their pricing) but we LOVE this place.    Note that they are only open on certain evenings."}
{"text":"Not too many people venture out this way to the California hotel in the old part of Las Vegas. They have an elevator special that is a great deal for $20! It includes a porterhouse steak with vegetables and choice of pilaf, garlic mashed potatoes, or baked potato. It is also served with salad or soup and the meal is completed with an apple dessert.   French onion soup: This came in a tiny cauldron of French onion soup topped with bubbling gruyere. The soup was very rich and filled with lots of onion. My only complaint was that the crouton was already very soggy as it arrived to the table.   Spinach salad: Typical wilted spinach salad with eggs, bacon, and onions  Clam chowder: I did not try this but it was said to be very \"clammy.\"  Porterhouse steak: Generously portioned steak. Mine was overdone this time and the meat seemed more grisly this time.   Crab legs: This is a giant platter of crab legs, already cracked and halved, served with clarified butter.   Apple dessert with vanilla ice cream: This dessert was okay, but a little to sweet. The caramel is very good though."}
