{"text":"Came here for a big birthday dinner and we were not disappointed. After reading the reviews we were prepared - they did try to up sell out lobster and king crab. We were specific in what size we wanted and for the most part they complied (only paid about 5 bucks extra for the bigger crab).  They come out with the live lobster and crab to show you and to take photos of your upcoming meal. Quite entertaining watching people take selfies with their lobsters.   Food was amazing! I love seafood and this really hit the spot. The presentation was really nice. Enjoyed every aspect of the meal.  The fried crab was really good - best part of the meal for sure! We also ordered a few extra dishes to complement all the seafood. We ordered a whole chicken which was good - on the smaller side considering you can go across the street to the supermarket to get a similar one for half the price. The mushroom efu noodle was meh - soggy and sticky. This place definitely has their seafood skills down - wouldn't order their other dishes.   We had extras so they packed it up and we had lunch for the next day. The service here was not characteristic of typical Chinese restaurants. We had great service with friendly staff coming by to wish my loved one a happy birthday (we had a cake and they volunteered to refrigerate it for us)."}
{"text":"Too crowded and noisy. Servers are too busy to attend your request.  Food is served faster than customers can handle that some are cool down before consumption.  These make the experience terrible.  Not a good place for gathering and food enjoying."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the Lobster Hong Kong style but the server informed us that there was a 4 pounds minimum and she pointed to the package price for two people which was around $60.00.  We ordered this package and the server soon came back with a 4.5 lbs lobster which we quickly sent back since it was only the two of us and having read the other reviews, we knew we would be charged for the difference - no sucker here!  The server then came back with a lobster which weighed 4.05 lbs.  Let me tell you, the presented dish was so impressive when they brought it to our table that we just chowed down and devoured the whole dish!  It was super delish and we didn't even care that we were making such a mess around our plates.  We wondered if there were any restaurants in NYC Chinatown that serves the same Lobster Hong Kong style - if so, please let me know!  Definitely a dish to experience!  As for the service, our server was very nice but don't expect refined service.  We still talk about it and we would definitely go back if we were to make the hike from Bethlehem, PA."}
{"text":"Prepare seafood in fast food manner. Deep fried seafood is hot but tasteless. The seafood is giant size but the actual meat shrinks a lot after deep fry. Vegetable is oily which is same as having heavy dressing salad."}
{"text":"Never ever order take-out from this restaurant. It is the biggest rip off ever. We had ordered their king crabs and a couple other side dishes for dinner, expecting that the crabs looks like the ones in the tank, it turns out it doesn't. I have eaten at the restaurant the week prior, and the crabs appear much larger than the ones for take-out. I strongly advise you do not order take out from them."}
{"text":"My parents and I have been craving to try out this seafood restaurant for a while. We came here a while back during the Christmas holidays but never managed to get a table because reservations were needed in advance. Spontaneously, my parents and I decided to go back again today hoping to get a table. We went before dinner time around 5 pm on a Monday night and was lucky enough to get a table before the flood of customers came in. However, it is highly recommended that reservation is made one day in advance to guarantee yourself a table as they are always jam packed with people no matter what day of the week you go.  The interior is typical of any Chinese restaurant with many round tables and fish tanks of lobsters and crabs lined up against their walls. Their speciality lies mainly in lobsters and crabs so there were only a few meat dishes. We ordered the 'Dinner for 3' combo set that came with their soup of the day, hong kong style deep fried lobsters (5.5 lbs), steamed sea bass (1.5 lbs), stir-fry vegetables topped with goji berry and almond milk dessert. Beware, the prices stated on the menu is only the base price not the fixed price. If the lobster or fish is more than the stated weight, they will charge you extra, so make sure to ask/ clarify before you order.  After we ordered, the waiter came over and showed us the live lobsters that we were going to be eating. They were absolutely gigantic with their claws still moving. I guess this friendly gesture was to ensure the customer that they were being served with live rather than cheaper dead lobsters.  The soup was the first to be served. It was stewed with dried bok choy, pork and shiitake mushrooms. Taste wise, there wasn't anything really special, it was like any soup of the day you would find at a Chinese restaurant. Although, it did help warm up my belly and opened up my appetite for the lobster and fish dishes to come.   The leaning tower of lobster was the star of the night. The presentation of the hong kong style deep fried lobster was incredibly beautiful. If i had to describe it in metaphorical terms, it was like placing Mount Kilimanjaro onto a plate. It was so massive that we ended up packing 4 takeout boxes of it home. It was served on a bed of crunchy deep fried baby fish and topped with sliced cabbage. I was expecting a burst of flavours but to my dismay, the flavours were not pungent and flavourful enough. All that I could really taste was the deep friedness of the lobster with a little hint of spiciness to it.  The steamed fish was topped with loads of green onions and parsley, and came with a wine glass of soy sauce to be poured over. The fish was steamed very well with the meat being very delicate and tender.  It was nice to savour on some greens after devouring a mountain of deep friedness.  The almond milk dessert was a nice finish to the entire meal. It was sweet but not overly sweet. The texture was thick and silky.  All in all, I would say the presentation of the seafood at this restaurant scores higher than the actual taste of its food. Not that I didn't enjoy the seafood, the flavours were just not as flavourful as I expected to be. In terms of price, they are on the pricy side. We spent a total of $161 with taxes and tips included. They automatically include the tip for you and I don't blame them for that because their waiters/waitresses do come around every so often to change your plates. I think I've gotten my plate changed 3 times in the 2 hours I was there. You also do get a generous amount of seafood. Their 3 person combo set can easily fill up 4 or 5 people."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical about coming here only because of the high prices but after eating here, I was very glad I came! It was worth every dollar we spent.   Food: They honestly make the best seafood I have eaten in Toronto. The lobster in dry garlic was my personal favourite because the lobster (7lb) itself was so amazingly sweet and went so well with the light batter and garlic pieces. They cut the lobster into good sized chunks which made it very easy to just bite the meat off the shell with little effort. My sisters favourite was the crab in HK style because of the spicy kick it has (it wasn't too spicy for me, a person who has a low spice tolerance). And I didn't know HK style was tiny fried sardines! I have no complaints about the flavours whatsoever. They exceeded my expectations especially with how fast the food all arrived! All the food reached our table within 15min of ordering.   Service: This is why I gave it a 4 star instead of 5. Though they were speedy, it didn't make up for the lack of attention from all the workers. And yes, it was nice of them to pack our food into take out containers for us but they were \"dirty\" about it. The gentleman that did it for us used his own bare hands to try and make the pieces fit into the containers. And when he was done packing each container, he placed it on top of all the dirty dishes which made everything super greasy.   All in all, I would definitely come back here for another special occasion to try all the different dishes they offer!"}
{"text":"Great food but expect to spend a lot of money on it. I've been here about 3 times and the deep fried lobster was always a treat."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. It's amazing. The food is delicious, it's expensive but worth the price. The set meals are amazing. It's a must go for seafood lovers!"}
{"text":"I'm done with this place.  Even though the food is really good, the troubles I've experienced is not worth it.    First of all, we had booked a table for 12 on Thursday for 8:30.  We were told to be there by 8:15.  We arrived at 8 and were told that there was no record of our reservation.  They didn't really want to accommodate us, and expected us to leave.  Unacceptable, where is a group of 12 supposed to go?  It's not like we called in to book a reservation, my mother physically came in and saw them writing our reservation down the day before.  After a lot of going back and forth and finally going to the manager, they magically found us a table.    Dishes as usual was delicious, which is why I gave it the 3 stars.  However, another HUGE mistake was that they gave us a dead eel for one of the dishes instead of a live one.  Probably figured that bc we're CBC that we wouldn't know the difference of how a fresh one is supposed to taste.  That eel was also drenched in extremely salty sauce which is a trick that restaurants do to disguise food that is not fresh.  WTH.  We ate one piece and knew.  When an eel is freshly prepared, the meat is bouncy and sticks to the bones. The fried fish dish was completely inedible.  I don't know where the meat in the fish was, since it was basically just fried skin, bones and hollow insides.    Our total bill was just a few dollars shy of $800.  At that price, I expect almost perfection.    My recommendation is that you should double check that your reservation has been kept, since this also happened to a few other people I know, and to bring someone very Chinese, so they don't trick you with unfresh fish."}
{"text":"This restaurant gives a good experience. The decor and atmosphere was nice. The food was OK, I did not enjoy the seafood as much as I thought I would have. Granted it was fresh, I was not a fan of the deep fried lobster/crab that we got. The flounder was bony with not much meat. The chicken soup was a broth of black chicken which I never had before. The black bean pudding was not too sweet, a nice way to end off the meal."}
{"text":"The best way to cook king crab and lobster, two thumbs up to the chefs.  The worst way you can expect to be waited upon. My sympathies to the owner!"}
{"text":"Epic meal!!!  If you are a seafood lover, this place will not disappoint.  From taste to presentation, this is the place to go.  Been here a few times already, each and every time was phenomenal.  I just don't understand how places like Red Lobster and Lobster Trap stay in business? If you like your lobster steamed with a stick of melted butter,  than sure, go to your nearest Red Lobster.  If you are looking for something more exciting and flavorful, you need to come here.  They stack up your lobster half a metre high on the plate!    As I'm typing this review out, i actually had to  unbutton my jeans, but when i reached down, it popped already lol.   Food tastes much better when it is free (ah, benefits of being the youngest in the family).  Price of pre-set meal was about $200.  After tax and tip, about $270. which is not bad at all.    Two 5.5 lbs lobster cooked 3 different ways.  Each was very unique and very tasteful.  The pre-set meal also came with a soup, plate of veggie, streamed fish, fried rice and dessert.    Will i come back... will the sun rise trm? Lol, of course i will be back."}
{"text":"We expected the bill to be high so we didn't question it at the time, but our bill was either wrong, or they completely padded our bill. We ordered:   - 6.61 lbs Lobster Hong Kong Style ($18.99/ lb + $15.99 Hong Kong Style) = $141.51 - 6 pieces Oyster with Honey and Pepper = around $18.99 - 6 pieces Oyster with Ginger and Green Onion = around $18.99 - 6 pieces Albatross with Oyster (4 pieces around $18.99) = $28.48 - E-Fu noodle with mushroom = around $18.99  With tax and 15% tip our bill should have been about $295. Our bill came out to be $510.40.   The food was delicious, and the service was very good, but we overpaid by over $200. In the future definitely ask to calculate bill in front of us."}
{"text":"My family and I tried this place for lunch yesterday because my uncle heard really good things about it. I was very surprised to see how many tables had huge plates of lobsters and crabs on their table...for lunch! The restaurant is surrounded by glass tanks filled with giant crabs and lobsters all crammed together. The decor and ambience was quite upscale and luxurious, I felt a little like royalty eating there.   What I didn't like about my experience was how our server kept pushing/pressuring us to order this $198 set meal, saying how it was perfect for a group of 7 like us. That just seemed like an insane amount to be spending on a lunch, especially since we're the type of family that usually goes to Congee Queen for a cheap and quick meal. I also didn't like how they tried to upsize our lobster, with the excuse being they had no smaller lobsters. We had to pay an an extra ~$10 for the lobster since it came to a little over 4 lbs.   We ordered the fried garlic lobster, plain congee with dried scallops, two noodle dishes, and a plate of veggies. I reaaaaally loved the lobster it was cooked to perfection!! The outside was slightly crunchy with hints of spiciness and garlic flavour that was just sooo good. The lobster itself was super juicy and succulent on the inside. The congee with dried scallops was also really delicious and paired nicely with something so rich in flavour like the lobster. The two noodle dishes wasn't too special and kind of pricey for such small portions. None of us really touched the veggies, it was so oily you could see the coats of oil shining in the light. We got complimentary desserts in the end, so I guess that made up for the bad service in the beginning.  I think this place is great for seafood lovers and is a must-go! I don't eat a lot of seafood myself, but I do love me some good lobster :) I will definitely be coming back since my family really enjoyed the food here, but definitely not for lunch (unless you really do eat like a prince at lunch, and a peasant at dinner). We never usually spend this much on a meal so for me, this is one of those restaurants that are more suitable for big family gatherings or a special occasion."}

{"text":"Went there for Mother's Day lunch. Arrived before 11:30 am, hoping to get a table before the lunch hour rush. There wasn't many people in the restaurant at that time. The host asked us how many, told her two plus a baby. She rolled her eyes and said, \"Sorry, we don't have a table for 2. We are fully booked today.\" But it was almost empty! I think it was really rude! So people remember they don't serve fewer parties in holidays so they can save their tables for bigger groups with more spending. The more money you spend, the bigger smile you get. Small family or just a couple don't bother, you will only be greeted with rejection!"}
{"text":"This is my fave place for seafood! The lobster and crab they prepare is so delicious and flavourful. If you get the fried version it can be a bit greasy but they give you plastic gloves to use if you want to. Also, if you choose one of the set dinner menus there is always way more than enough food for the amount of people it states it is for. We always take boxes of leftovers home! If you love seafood this is a must try restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wow. The portions for this place is insane. I went with my mom and brother and we got a set meal for 3 and I don't think we could have finished it if there were 4 of us. The food was really tasty and service was pretty quick too. I didn't really like how chaotic and loud it was but it's pretty standard for a canto restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered the Hong Kong style 5.5lbs lobster combo. The meal included soup, lobster (fried, and mildly spicy), a veggie dish, steamed bass, and dessert.  Delicious, much better than Omei in Richmond hill.  Side note:  I would like to remind patrons eating there not to act like douchebags, I.e. Posing and having your pictures taken with the Alaskan King crab or lobster that you'd just picked and is about to be eaten by you.  Very tacky and cruel.  WTF? It seemed like every other table was doing that.  I only wish one day, those folks would be swimming in the ocean, and get eaten by a big ass crab or lobster.  Poetic justice."}
{"text":"We made reservations for 7 at 1:30. Arrived here around 1:30 and we were seated right away. It was not too busy here for lunch at this time.  As we were told the portions were huge, we ordered the set lobster and king crab dinner menu for 4. We were glad that we did! This menu for 4 was plenty for 7 people. We were satisfied with all the dishes. The menu came with a soup, lobster tower, king crab done 3 ways, veggie dish and a dessert.  The service was what is to be expected for an Asian restaurant. Don't expect attentive wait staff even though it is not busy. We had to ask to change our plates as the shells were piling up.  Overall, we had a good experience."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, although the service could be better.  But, given the absolutely tastiness of their food, they could be the Soup Nazi level of service and I'd still go back.    Whenever I go, it's with a large group and we get the full set menu with all the fixings including oysters fried in shrimp paste, alaskan king crab prepared two ways and the deep fried lobster.  The alaskan king crab is steamed and served over egg whites and is absolutely delicious.  However, the star is definitely the crispy deep fried lobster.  It's absolutely amazing!  Highly suggest that you visit this place, but make sure to make a reservation and come with a large party of at least 6!"}
{"text":"The lobster or crab are brought to the table, for your approval prior to cooking it.    Eight of us ordered:  The 6 to 8 person, 25 pound lobster mountain set which includes a decent bottle of white wine, snow pea shoots with goji berries, a corn, egg drop soup and a black sesame soup for dessert.  We also ordered 3 Heineken's and a lobster roe, fried rice. Total cost of the meal including tip, $509.00.   The meal begins with the corn, egg drop soup. Followed by a piquant, succulent, chilli and crispy fried onions, garlic lobster mountain, set in a bed of lettuce.   Some of the meat had a custardy texture, illustrating it's freshness. The under seasoned snow pea shoots and fried rice expertly compliment the flavour bomb that is the lobster tower.   The restaurant offers a lively vibe. The service was friendly and most of the staff spoke English.   Fishman Lobster Clubhouse is another example of overpriced, Toronto restaurants."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting too much from this place and when i saw the menu, it was bit pricier than my expectation. However, all my thought disappeared as soon as i tried their crab and lobster! It was so good! Soft juicy and tender crab meat and huge lobster with full of flavour! My friends and I really enjoyed and like to give five stars but only downside was a service. Waitstaff was not friendly and helpful when we asked about menu.  Oh and they only accept debit and cash.. which I was so closed to my daily limit for debit transaction."}
{"text":"This place is good for seafood! It's a little bit pricy but compared to other seafood restaurants it is definitely worth it! It is quite busy during weekends so u need to make reservation.   Food is authentic hk style. Went there with other 3 friend we ordered the king crab and lobster combo for 399 it came with one king crab, one lobster, one vege, soup and desert. Oh man! It tastes so good. But almost everything is deep fried though. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Price wise is cheaper than O-Mei but we still think O-Mei tastes better. This place is packed even at 10:00pm so make sure you reserved days ahead esp. for holidays. They accept cash or bank card."}
{"text":"I'm Back!!! With Vengeance to conquer this EPIC seafood dream meal with 11 ppl...All Asian!!! Surprising, considering asian ppl like to save all their money and eat at home. At this place, was a chaotic zoo on friday at 6PM. PACKED house full of big tables on all corners, with smaller tables in the middle. Surrounded by aquarium full of Giant deliciousness of Lobster Gods and King Crab!  We ordered TWO Giant 8lbs of Lobster with ONE Giant King Crab! Both lobsters usually are prepared with 4 different styles, but we asked just for one style each. All full of fried garlic, but one with chili spice.   - This is very enjoyable meal. Lobster meat was nicely cooked as usual.  Now on to the King Crab cooked all of its legs, split in halves with some nice light wine broth with some scallions, eggs and such. This was nice tender meat in your mouth. Easy to consume, and definitely a better treat than lobsters.  Eel Dish. I didn't really eat it, but it looked fine.  Lobster Egg Fried Rice. The usual clumps of lobster roe in your avg fried rice = Super tasty!   Some veggies dish...Boring  Steam fish. The usual.  Desserts: Black sesame... The usual...  Bill was very expensive meal...   Oh yeah, you get to play with your food literally, before they bring it for a nice hot bath and prepare your meal for you... hahaha"}
{"text":"Our go to restaurant for lobster!  After hearing and reading great reviews about Fishman Lobster Clubhouse we decided to give them a try for our lobster fix.  Went in with high expectations and happy to say that we weren't disappointed.  A little on the pricey side with the set menus, but well worth it.  Have been back multiple times and the service and food has always been top notch.  Our first visit had a bit of an accident with our waiter spilling my beer, but that was quickly replaced and comped.  The staff have always been amazing offering to take pictures and answering questions about the food.  This is a go to place whenever we are taking friends or family out to impress."}
{"text":"I was all set on making a trip to eat here food looks amazing until I stumbled upon picture number 300 something and saw a picture of shark fin soup! Disgusting!!! Disgraceful!!! Holy vile horrible awful people contribute to the destruction of humanity and the worlds atmosphere itself. So inhuman so disgusted. Who serves that shit? Better yet who eats that shit? Who is that disturbed that needs to eat something that was brutally murdered and tortured to death?"}
{"text":"This is a place where in my opinion you go for eating good quality sea food dishes,  probably with your family or close friends. I'd go for a date to another one as the location is small and basic.   Would recommend to get there for a buffet as you can try all you can eat from the bar and their seafood is something unique and tasty. For that one you gotta check out their website,  it's twice a month on Sundays."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to come here at least once. The food is fantastic and ordering a combo is the best \"deal\" since ordering individual dishes will cost you more. Typical Chinese service - fast and efficient..just the way I like it. Make sure you try the lobster in HK style! Or anything in HK style...the tastiness level will blow your mind!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today. Made a reservation for the 11:30am seating and it wasn't too busy. We ordered the lobster lunch special at $13.99/lb (we ordered 7lb). This comes with the fried rice, snow pea leaves, and dessert. In addition, we got 2.5lb of the Vancouver crab cooked in the ginger and scallion style. This was for four people. I've read a lot of complaints about upselling, but we didn't experience this at all. In fact, the waiter recommended we only get a 2.5lb crab (not larger) because we would have quite a bit of food from the lunch special.  They brought out both the crab and the lobster for us to see, and told us exactly how much they weighed and cost before confirming our order. They allow you to take a picture with them if you want, but that wasn't our thing so they were sent straight to the kitchen for cooking!  The crab was delicious! I've eaten a lot of lobster cooked with ginger and scallion, as it is one of my favourites, and this is definitely at the top. So good. The Hong Kong style lobster is new to me. Lived in Hong Kong for several years and never had it, but wow. It was absolutely delicious. It has a nice spicy flavour, but not overwhelming. The fried rice was also very good, using parts of the lobster for flavour. The snow peas with goji berry were cooked well, but may have been a little bland (or seemed so) due to the strong flavours from the other dishes.  All in all, everything tasted fresh and was cooked very well. We spent $195 (tax + tip included), so it's not bad for $50pp."}
{"text":"This place is a huge rip off!  Beware when you arrive here.  They will ALWAYS up sell you.  Our $288. Set meal came out to $557.!!!  I was really upset about that.  The waiter said they didn't have smaller crabs...same story they tell ALL table.  Don't let them fool you.  Also, let it be known that a set dinner for 4 is more than enough to feed 6.  Or, I guess it was in our case because they lied and sold us a larger crab.  Also, the hostess, Winnie, has got to be one of the RUDEST person I have ever come across.  She was a mega-bitch.  Seriously, get over yourself.  You're a restaurant worker!  As for the food, I found it just ordinary.  All deep fried and bland.  Heavy/rich tasting.  I will never ever go back.  Huge scam that management has going.  Oh, and they automaticly include tips into your bill.  Scoundrels!  Save your money folks.  For $557 you can buy a lot of crab and hire a personal chef to cook it for you."}
{"text":"Note this establishment is cash business and Canadian debits cards only. Made reservations sat us pretty fast and quickly. Service was good. Food was good. If you go try not to order everything fried. It's a bit too much on the palate. Also don't get the overweight or large lobsters they are trying to sell you. Meat gets tough since it is older. We got steamed fish/ Alaskan king crab/ lobster/ saute Chinese vegetables and seasfood fried rice. Overall it is good but its a bit pricey even for seafood."}
{"text":"10lb lobster towers and gigantic/meaty crab legs is what this place is known for! This is a seafood lovers paradise - fish, oysters, sharks fin,  abalone,  eel, and even more exotic options.  I wouldn't say this place is affordable,  but definitely good value for the seafood you are getting. Whatever you order, they show you it alive before they cook it, make sure they get the okay from you, and that you know it's fresh!!!  My favorite here is the lobster and crab. Usually for a large lobster, the meat tastes a bit off, but here each bite is amazing. I'm also not usually a huge fan of crab (mostly because there ain't a lot of meat) but here there is so much tasty crabmeat in the legs, simply delicious. When you order crab, they provide you with 3 dishes, the legs, the claws, and a fried rice dish; all superb.  Highly recommend any seafood lover to check this spot out!!!"}
{"text":"I'd say it is actually 3.5 according to my scale.  Prices were reasonable, we paid about a approx 50 per person.  We had 4 people.  Got 5lbs of lobster, crab noodles, lobster rice, 4 oysters, 2 side bowls of rice, garlic pepper beef and greens.  The ambiance is very nice, nice dog and pony show with the seafood before they cook it, it's clean and there is plenty of space versus some Chinese restaurants that really try to pack them in.  You definitely had to make reservations.  They get a A+ for presentation for sure.  Tastewise, the lobster with garlic was okay, we were more impressed with the visual.  Crab noodles where ok.  Lobster rice was good.   The Black Pepper beef and greens were very good.   The Oysters ($6 each) were good but very salty.  My wife said they wrap the oyster in salted egg and then dipped in batter before it's deep fried.     Reality is we would likely not go back unless we had out of town guests as there are many other places that have better food for the price.   The actual prices are a non issue due to the fact we knew we were not going to some fast food place.  Staff is very attentive.  And boy did we take alot of pictures.  Another poster said not to be a doucebag and take pictures.  All I can say is that person was a moron.   That person must be fun at parties (NOT !).  Part of price tag, the food and the ambiance of the place is why you would go and why you would not want to take pictures ?"}
{"text":"Lobster is delicious, the price is quite expensive if you go with a group. 2 ppl will be about $60 each. If you go with a group of friends your paying the same amount and barely eaten anything.  The sever will hassle you to order the expensive items.  Got sucked in the first time, the second and third time I order moderate price items and it is just as great!!"}
{"text":"We were here on the weekend for the first time to celebrate an anniversary. We made a reservation for four and at the last minute change it to six and they were still able to accommodate us. Seating was very tight as the tables were placed too close to each other and we were rubbing shoulders with the people next to us. There are many choices of set dinners, with the main item always being either the lobster or King crab. The prices were all hefty, so expensive that I can't remember seeing higher prices at any other restaurants in the area. A soup was included with the set dinner but that was very salty. The lobster was encrusted with a special blend of garlic, the texture was like crushed dry cereal without milk, but the taste was too sweet, so much so that it took away the natural taste of the lobster and you got nothing but a mouthful of sugar. They do have a dedicated team of staff for changing plates but the process was not what you would expect from a higher priced restaurant. At other restaurants the waiters usually come around behind you to take away your dirty plates and replace it with a clean one, without help from the patron, but because the tables here were placed too close together the waiters have no room to walk behind you, instead they just stand at one end and expect you to hand over your plates to them. Not very classy. At the end of the meal we were literally \"forced out\". After paying the bill we were chatting and trying to finish our tea, Three waiters came standing around our table and were just staring at us. When they see that we were not leaving immediately they started cleaning out the table and saying \"thank you for coming\" \"thank you for coming\" and we had no choice but to leave. Very rude. By the way a 10% tip was mandatory and charge to our bill automatically. We're only a party of six and no where on the menu did it mention mandatory tipping. Not that the service was bad and we weren't going to pay the standard 10%, but because they didn't give me a chance to make that decision on my own I decided to not give more. All in all, very promising beginning, but overrated and mediocre food, with poor customer relations at the very end."}
{"text":"Best Crab & Lobster Restaurant in Toronto. We ordered a King Crab Dinner for 2 which consist of Shark Fin Soup, Abalone. Crab cooked 2 ways, Fried Rice. Everything was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"This place was not worth my money. It is very expensive the lobster and crab was so plain. They deep fried the lobster and crab and put a bunch of garlic chips on it barely any taste very plain. The service was so bad, I asked if they could to go the food and the waitress gave me a nasty look. DEFINITELY WOULD NOT COME BACK NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY."}
{"text":"The good is great. Soooooo delicious but they need to have more desert on their menu and more drinks on their menu such as Shakes and martinis. The service need to be a little bit faster. Most of the waiters do not speak English clearly. But overall it's a beautiful restaurant nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is the third time we went to this restaurant and everytime we are completely satisfied with the food. The services could be improve a bit but overall everything was awesome, well except for the price :)."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Got a package where they cook the lobster a few ways: hk style, cooked in Maggie sauce, classic steamed. Loved them all! The package came with a sea bass that we got steamed instead of in soup and the lobster roe was cooked in egg and steamed.   I've been told that the lobster roe fried rice was amazing, I must try t next time!   The server we got who took our order was great, very helpful and suggested this package since its our first time and we wanted to try all the ways the lobster could be cooked. I could fairly say it's the best service I've experienced at a Chinese restaurant (stress on that qualifier so don't over expect).   Best $198 (taxes and tip incl) I've paid for lobster! And we loove our lobsters!"}
{"text":"OK, don't let the 5 star rating fool you. This place is G-H-E-T-T-O. Tacky decor, wait staff shouting at each other from across the restaurant, sitting elbow to elbow with other patrons, etc... Typical Chinese restaurant basically... including a restaurant name that was lost in translation...  So WTF does it get 5 stars? The seafood is super fresh and skillfully prepared. You can tell the chef knows what he's doing. If you didn't make a reservation, you'll find yourself standing at the doorway surrounded by live eels, geoduck, green bass, dungeness crabs, 12 lb. lobsters, scallops, clams, etc. You almost feel like you're standing in an aquarium. So here's what I had:  1) Abalone - if you've had abalone before and found it chewy, tasteless, and sinewy, it's because it wasn't fresh. At the Fishermen, it's really really tender and you almost don't need a knife to cut through it. 2) Shark's fin soup- this isn't the cheap stuff you get at Chinese weddings that has bean sprouts, vermicelli, chicken, mushrooms, and tiny little slivers of shark's fin in it. This is 100% shark fin in big slices, just like what you'd find in Thailand. No fillers at all. 3) Lobster- can be prepared in multiple ways with one lobster if you like (steamed garlic, fried garlic, onion/ginger, Maggi, etc.) 4) Dungeness crab- already shelled and steamed in egg whites for you. The roe is also steamed with egg in a separate dish. 5) Clams in beer broth- need I say more? 6) Whole eel in black bean sauce 7) Beef 'n cashews- I couldn't make it sound more appetizing, but it was REALLY good with the fried garlic and honey!  Anyways, if you're looking for authentic Chinese seafood and don't mind the ghettoness, try this place out!"}
{"text":"Food quality is really good  * however, they don't accept credit card. Hopefully in the future! It's a really a \"must\" to try here in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"Went here for a bday dinner several weeks ago. We had the huge lobster mountain - 4 lobsters, 50 lbs, deep fried Hong Kong style and devoured by 10 hungry people. It was around $50pp. You think for that price you would get some free rice? No we had to pay for that extra. The dessert was some nasty grey pudding thing but again no one came here for dessert, this isn't Cafe Demetre. I would def eat here time and time again if it weren't for the high price point. Wonderful chunky meaty pieces of Lobster goodness mmmm"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone if you're looking for service. We had the works- King crab, lobsters, fish, veggies and soup for our party of 10. It was an $800 meal. We were rushed throughout our meal. They slammed our dishes down when they arrived. At 8:22 they told us we needed to be finished and gone at 8:30. They had no compassion. It was my friends 5 yr old bday and we had brought a cake for her. The manager was rushing us again and said the next reservation was here and she said to me why is everyone leaving me with such sad eyes as she was trying to eat her piece of birthday cake. Not only that, none of us got to eat our dessert. The manager said they can pack it up for us because again the next party was here which we did not agree to.  I don't see this place surviving with such poor service. I did not enjoy the negative atmosphere and the food was maybe a 6-7 out of 10 at most.  BTW it's cash only. What kind of shady place only takes cash nowadays, especially for meals that have a hefty price tag.  If you're looking for mediocre food for a high price tag and horrendous service, be sure to eat here!"}
{"text":"I won't give one point if i can. DO NOT GO HERE. We used to go here with family several times a year since they open. Tonight, everything changed, and we will not go to this fucking place any more. We finished all the food, which was ok but not as good as before, and still waited for our veggie. Asked the waitress so many time, and it comes right after we ask for bill. we complained to the manager, he was so rude and having poker face, no apologies."}
{"text":"came in here with a party and had ordered their lobster mountain, crab mountain, crab legs, fish, a veggie dish, and soup. to be honest that was way too much food, but hey, we're there to celebrate so why not. the lobster mountain was ok, tasted like it would from other asian restaurants, except it was just 4x the size. same with the crab mountain. i think both came on a bed of fried garlic and that was pretty good to take away to fry up on another day. the most mind blowing were this simple crab leg dish. they were perfectly cut in half, the whole length of the meat exposed, wasn't fried, probably blanched. the meat was still very very tender. man that was good. but other than that dish, 4 figures to close the bill for a full party didn't seem to match..."}
{"text":"I prefer omei more than this place.  Payment, bring cash/debit because they don't take credit cards.  Decor, nicely laid out restaurant with 3 out of 4 walls being walls of seafood.  It is nicely lit with good looking chandelier.  Service, it was not up to par but I think it was because we had lunch at 2pm which was overlapping their lunch time.  Plates weren't switched, we had to flag them down to get more tea/water.  They did seem to be in a rush to get us to order even though our whole party wasn't there yet and they were only 10 minutes later than us.  They just kept coming and asking us what we wanted to eat and we kept telling them we are waiting for others.  Food, we ordered the $368 combo, which consisted of crab 3 ways, 1 lobster mountain, a soup, veggie dish and dessert.  The food was okay, the presentation I think is the stand out at this restaurant which you can see from the pictures.  Don't expect too many choices besides the seafood dishes here.  I thought the soy crab was the best dish they had.  I thought the egg one was too salty, and the rice dish was okay.  The other dishes were okay, nothing amazing.  Price, it seemed comparable to Omei, but I like Omei's food infinitely more and their dessert by comparison is out of this world.  Here you only get one, no refills, whereas at Omei, you get 4, and you can ask for more at no cost."}
{"text":"One would only conceive of going to eat here if you are a seafood lover (not a \"seafood hugger\"), because it is pricy BUT you get what you pay for. So, if you are going to feel sorry for the sea creatures that you are eating or complain that it is pricy, then don't waste your time or money to eat here. It is cash only, so make sure you go to the ATM before heading out to the restaurant. You do also have to make a reservation in advance (about a week) as it gets pretty packed, especially during the holidays.   My friends and I love going to eat here but you do have to choose your combo/package wisely. For example,  you could order a combo and some side dishes AND if they try to upsell you, be firm and say no thank you. Chances are, they are going to tell you that even though the menu says \"6 lbs lobster\" they could only find an 8 lbs lobster and so it will cost you more money. Just recently I've noticed that there is less up-selling and that the manager (instead of your waiter/waitress) delivers your bill and change.   One of my favourite value-for-your-money combos to order is the \"Fish, Crab, & Lobster Dinner for 6-7 ppl\". It comes with:  Soup Fried Lobster w/ Dry Garlic (6lbs) Crab in HK Style (2.5 lbs) Steamed Flounder (2.5 lbs) Veggie with Fresh Clam Meat  Dessert   for $238   As I mentioned, you will likely end up paying more as they will give you a crab and lobster and fish that weigh more than what is listed on the menu, so this menu option will actually feed about 8 - 10 people. Adding other side dishes from their standard menu is an option. You can also ask them to change the way your lobster/crab is prepared, but there is a cost (I think it's an extra $5). Their dessert choices are your standard chinese soupy desserts like black sesame porridge and red bean \"soup\", but my fave is their cashew \"porridge?\". Mmmmm.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome! The lobster combo and upgrade to HK style lobster are worth every penny. Best lobster I've ever had. I would recommend making a reservation because it was a 2 hour wait when we went during a weekday.  Will definitely go back when we visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"When we were seated we were given the expensive menu where everything was over $300.  We knew there were other menus and therefore asked for it.  The waitress gave us attitude when we asked for the cheaper menus.  We did end up getting from the cheaper menu and they kept pushing for us to order more.    The place is really busy.  Don't bring your fancy purses because if your chair is facing an aisle,  the servers wipe their hands on your chair.    Also, it gets really loud inside, the tables around us had the obnoxious loud, douchey people which gets really annoying.    Overall good food but very poor environment.  Service is poor and they will rush you out."}
{"text":"This place is a complete rip off. Staff very pushy. We had 2 in our party and waitress repeatedly tried to push us toward the 2 person set at 219. When asked if they accept credit card, the response was \"our credit card machine is experiencing some problem\". Told us to go next door to withdraw cash.  We're from out of town so did not want to pay the bank fee, however, waitress kept asking if we have cash.  After going back and forth, waitress walked away to check on credit card machine.  And of course machine now works.  Again she push us towards ordering the 219 set  meal.  We politely decline and left.  We went back to our favorite place, Dong Kee on Midland and had a 5 course  meal for less than 100."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner with my family. The food was descent, but the server's attitude destroy the whole diner. There's a mid age bald male server (maybe he's the manager ) was the worse server that I even seen."}
{"text":"Cost: expensive Quality: very good - 90% for seafood Decor: average - 75% tight  Staff: average service - 70% and hard sell, WILL up sell for sure Value: good - 80%  Keeper? Yes will go back after saving enough money. :P"}
{"text":"If you like Chinese Made lobster this is the place to goto.  Pretty expensive imho but certainly you get your fair share of the lobster.  Don't bother with the fish as they over did the fish imho but the lobster + crab were def. their speciality."}
{"text":"eh.......i probably wouldn't eat anything but king crab from this place. didnt like how they handled lobster."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the only places in the GTA that truly specializes in lobster and other seafoods. I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you have a large party because you can try a variety of items with their party combos. Will definitely continue to come here for special occasions."}
{"text":"After having dined at this restaurant many times over the past several years, I've finally decided (and found time) to write a review.  This Chinese seafood restaurant is very clean and well organized. A bit more than half of the dining room is surrounded by fish/lobster/crab tanks, one of which holds your meal. The tables and chairs are clean and they provide you with a box of disposable plastic gloves for your dining convenience.  Note that the meal packages that include lobsters, crabs, etc. are not fixed priced. It is almost 100% certain that you will be charged more because the one that they show you weighs more than the one included in the package. The waiter will, however, show you the price tag before they start cooking, and allow you to hold them take pictures with them. Also note that this is a cash only restaurant, but it won't be a huge problem since there are many banks within walking distance of this place. Scotiabank is in the same parking lot, and RBC Royal Bank is in the next mall. And lastly, note that they automatically include a 10% gratuity on their bill, but the server will usually let you know of that charge when giving you the bill.  Washroom rating: 8/10"}
{"text":"First off the floor at our table was soaking wet!! We got seated at the back in front of the tanks and with our sandals we had to try to not touch the ground the whole time!   So the lobster and crab always weighs more than what's listed on the menu.. which is prob how they make money off of you . To be honest the taste just don't have enough zing to it . Not garlic enough . Not buttery enough . Not enough flavour. The only redeeming thing was the steamed fish . And that's because you can add soya sauce to it .   Also they serve Dom Perignon . Seriously. Hysterical."}
{"text":"WARNING : THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF LIKE CRAZY!   Ok, maybe this restaurant was actually good a few years back when they were trying to build their reputation, but that has definitely changed recently. They are now focused on money grabbing and do not care about the quality of the food that is served. Here are the following reasons why:  1. SCAM YOU FOR MORE MONEY! so they have packages and combos that you order, we ordered the 4 person combo E which says supposingly comes with 4.5lb lobster and 6lb crab. However they say their smallest lobster is 6lbs and smallest crab is 7lbs so they'll have to charge us an additional $50. This would of made sense to me if we had a late seating and all the smaller lobsters and crabs were sold out. However, we sat down at 5:30pm and you're telling us you don't have what you offer on the menu?!?!  So why even bother putting this on the menu if you don't offer it???   2. COOK TIME. We took a picture of the live crab/lobster, and we also took a picture of when the dishes arrived.. all at the same time.. The pictures were exactly 9 minutes apart. Does it really only take 9 minutes to bring the crab/lobster to the kitchen, clean it, chop it up, cook it, and stack it up beautifully? 9 minute prep and cook time?!  Questionable. Leads us to believe they didn't cook us the crab/lobster they showed us, and that they wanted us out quickly so they can squeeze in another table for more money. Also, the lobster and crab that actually came out was much smaller than what was shown to us.   3. TASTELESS. Seriously, tasted incredibly bland. How is it possible that crab and lobster meat taste exactly the same? Leads us to believe that they have it mass produced pre cooked in the back and maybe just re-fry it when an order is placed (hence the quick cook time). Probably from dead lobsters and crab too as it did not have the fresh seafood taste to the meat. In fact I think imitation crab taste better at this point.   4. ENVIRONMENT: you will notice tanks of lobsters on the right and tanks of crabs front and right. However these tanks seem to have the same amount of lobsters/crabs from the time we arrived to the time we left, yet every table there would of been ordering at least a lobster and a crab yet the tanks never seem to be decreasing... Hmm is this just for show?!   Seriously don't go here."}
{"text":"If you have a lobster craving, this definitely hits the spot! If you want to order other dishes, I recommend the lobster roe fried rice and beef tenderloin with asparagus. Yum!  Make sure you make reservations or else you will have to wait a while (unless you come in really late)! They have 6pm and 8pm seating times.   Regardless of what you order, the wait staff will try their best to up-sell you!"}
{"text":"Not good location. Need a lot improvement on customer service. Need to wait a bit for the food."}
{"text":"This will not be the best review as I do not recall all the details.  The bottom line though was a lot of money was spent feeding a couple of families at this place. The food was good but did not blow me away, probably a B or a 7.5/10.  It is not my value system to spend this much money on food, especially food that is good but not amazing. If you are going to charge me a lot, I want absolute excellence and I don't get that often, so I don't go to expensive places because I perceive it is not money well spent.  3.75 stars"}
{"text":"LOVE the food here. Seafood is fresh and meaty! You can't go wrong with ordering lobster or Alaskan king crab here. They also show you the live lobster/crab after they fetch it out of the tank. People like to take pix with them and what not. It's definitely more on the expensive side. They don't take credit card either. Only cash / debit."}
{"text":"If you are a seafood lover, this restaurant is for you. Because it is literally all you will get. Giant lobster mountains, shark fins soup, eel, crab are what is typically included in their set dinners. This restaurant has 2 waves, 6 and 8 PM. It is also when it is the most busy. Even if you make a reservation, you still need to wait a bit before you can get seated. If you didn't make a reservation, have fun waiting. The food is delicious, always fresh and well cooked. The tables are a little crowded and placed really close together. It is kind of pricey so don't come here with friends, come here with your family so they know what's good and they can pay for it after."}
{"text":"Literally only came to Canada to try this place out after seeing so many posts and videos about it on Facebook. THE LOBSTER MOUNTAIN WAS A MUST. I made a reservation the day before and the only time slots they had left were 9:45pm and 10:15pm. They were booked solid so definitely make a reservation DAYS in advanced. The restaurant itself was a great experience and definitely a place to try out with a big group of people. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We ordered the Double Large Lobster dinner for four for our group of 6. The portions were more than enough and we had leftovers for days. Each lobster dish was prepared in a different way and tasted great. My favorite was the fried lobster. I think going to this place once was enough for me. I'm all lobstered out for now."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place long before coming. Our family decided to come and celebrate my mother's 60 years old birthday. The menu is limited to Lobster and King Crab. We wanted to try the Lobster Mountain so we ordered that. We found out later that there was a cheaper and smaller portion which we would have appreciated. Why? Because the mountain was huge!!!! The Lobster was prepared very well with fried silver fish. It was delicious. The price is a little expensive but well worth it. The spacing is a little tight but we loved the experience overall. Not something we'd have regularly but once in awhile we will."}
{"text":"First thing, the food is delicious and satisfying. And yes it is pricey, but you get what you pay for.  That said, to echo other complaints the restaurant consistently and shamelessly scams its patrons who order the combos. Every time I order a combo the waiter lies and says that they only have crab/lobster heavier than indicated in the combo (e.g. only have 7.5 crab when the combo offers a 6 pounder).  They tell this lie every time to tack on exorbitant charges for heavier ingredients (the cost is $42 per additional pound, which is much more than the $30 per pound cost of the other 6 pounds of crab). This last time, WITHOUT my consent they also substituted lighter ingredients whose combined weight equals that of what I was paying for (2.5 and 1.5 lb lobsters instead of a 4 pounder), essentially dinging my wallet again, this time for shells.  They know that their food is good and that you will pay anyway. But obviously these misleading sales tactics are seedy, dishonest, and unnecessary. They also don't accept credit card. Clearly they only care about maximizing profits.  So yes the food was good, but the restaurant leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. Every time."}
{"text":"If you love deep fried seafood then you will be in heaven at this place. The presentation is insane with lobster parts arranged like the Tower of Babylon. Because all they serve is seafood, you are guaranteed that it's all fresh and very high quality. Don't bring friends who tend to eat like pigs, they will leave nothing for you. I actually can't give a good, thorough review because I only got to taste a few things due to my half pig friends. I will go back soon and update."}
{"text":"It's quite an interesting restaurant. As you walk in, you are faced with floor to ceiling tanks of fresh lobsters and fishes. There is lobster in the tank, the size of a small baby....ok, maybe not small baby, but around 8-10lbs. It was one of the most delicious chinese seafoods that I had ever tried thus far! The beef was very good too.  The restaurant is really small, it would be a good idea to call ahead. I agreed with some of the reviews,the plaza and restaurant is a bit dingy. But the food is great.  Oh, if you plan to order fish. Do remember to ask for the price. We made a mistake  of just picking a fish from the tank without asking the price. Cost us $50/fish. yup."}
{"text":"Went there for a cousins Birthday. the price was expensive (but expected)    to start us off we had soup, it did not have enough salt therefore tasteless.   seafood dishes were ok way to much garlic and onions super salty (now i know why the soup was tasteless all the salt went into the lobster). non seafood dishes were meh. felt rushed.  I understand there is a time limit but if a customer is dishing out hundreds of dollars for a meal you better not be rushing them if you want repeat business.  I would have given this place 3 stars but customer service was lacking.  The bill came up to $500 and it was a table of bankers, real estate brokers, so the chances of that table running on the bill or short changing them was slim.  The sever/manager picked up our cash and started counting them in front of us.  Felt like we were criminals and not trust worthy.   Most people would take the bill back to the cashiers desk to count the money.  The food was ok, I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. When I went to he restaurant my first impression of it was when I went to wash my hands in the wash room. In here toilet paper was scattered on top of everything and there were two dead and decaying baby rays in the corner. My second problem was my group was a party of 8. They refused to let us sit together and forced us to split into two tables of 4 , not even close together. I would've walked out if wasn't for my grandmother being hell bent on eating here from some recommendation she got. When we ordered, they came back to our table four times because they forgot the order. On top of that we ordered our lobster one way and the waiter said oh you don't want it that way because it was \"spicy\" but we ordered it spicy because we wanted it spicy. Also they took forever for our food. I know bringing the live lobster and crabs are part of their service but they shouldn't do that 45 minutes after we ordered. By that point it wasn't that amazing since everyone at our table was grumpy and hungry. The food eventually came and was ok; it would've been better if there wasn't so much drama before hand. By the time we were ready to pay, my aunt wanted to pay for both tables meals and asked the manager if he would bring both bills to her. The manager responded with \" absolutely, don't worry about it.\" And my aunt went back to our table to finish up her meal. By the time she asked manager again for the bill, he said he gave it to my other uncle sitting at the other table. She was upset and asked why he didn't give it to her and said some SEXIST comment back to her which I will not repeat. I hated my experience here and I will never come back here again and neither will anyone in my family."}
{"text":"This place is expensive as hell but damn, it's good. The atmosphere is awesome - you see the giant crabs and lobsters in tanks around the restaurant, the staff brings the crab and lobsters out for you to look at and take pictures with before preparing it in several ways.   We selected a 5-person dinner and they prepared the famous lobster tower, crab fried rice, crab legs, lobster leg tower, etc.   Honestly, it was overall a great experience and I would recommend everyone try it at least once for a special occasion!  TIP: Pay with cash for a slight discount!"}
{"text":"Not worth the price. Move on and grab seafood somewhere else. If you've never had it before, then yes, go ahead and splurge. But lots of Chinese restaurants do a mean seafood and this one for some reason is hyped up. The prices are reflective, they're super hyped up too."}
{"text":"I really did not enjoy my experience at this place. Especially when they bring out the lobsters to the customers so they can take pictures with them. I personally find it so disrespectful to the animal and treating as if it's not a life. Would you take a picture with the cow before killing it and turning it into some beef?   Food was not that great. The lobster was deep fried. Felt like I couldn't really taste the lobster. All the flavour was from msg.   Will not be back mainly because I don't agree with the lobster and entertainment concept."}
{"text":"We are Los Angeles Natives. The asian food in LA is wayyyyyyy bettteeerrrrr! The food and service here is ok. Beware cash or Canadian debit card only."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and it is delicious every time. I usually go with the King Crab (8lbs) cooking in 2 ways steamed and fried and Lobster also cooked in 2 ways, garlic and hong kong style (20lb) combo $599. Hong Kong style is my favourite, a bonus is that you can bring alcohol, we brought soju in, as long as they didnt sell it there they allowed us to bring it in. Book ahead for reservations as this place is always packed."}
{"text":"WOW! SEAFOOD! A LOT OF IT! This is definitely a place to eat as much as you can because it is all so good. Lobster, crab, clams, mussels, repeat. They bring your chosen lobster and crab to your table while it's alive (very gimmicky) and you can lift it up and take pictures with it before they take it back to the kitchen to get cooked. Fast service and definitely an unforgettable meal. Free parking and very spacious. Would love to go again -- if someone else is paying :)"}
{"text":"Don't let the 4-star rating fool you, this place is not a \"fine dining\" establishment! You come here to EAT. This is an odd place - when you walk in you are greeted by a floor to ceiling wall of tanks with huge lobster and fish. There are several large tables inside, but if you're a small group you'll be shown to their outdoor patio area for groups of 2-4. In the winter this seems ridiculous, even with the covered awning and the heaters everywhere it's quite drafty, but as soon as you start eating you warm up. Reservations are an absolute MUST, as this place gets very busy.  We ordered a few dishes, but the standouts were the Beef with mushroom, Beans & cashew (delicious!)  and the LOBSTER piled high with little fishes & not too spicy.  Minus half a star because cash only. No debit or credit. And minus another half a star for rather poor suggestion by the waitress - we asked  how large of a lobster 4 of us should order, along with our 4 other dishes and she recommended a 6 lb lobster! That's insane - we ended up asking for a 3.5 lb one, and were given a 4.2 lb instead (since I don't think they have anything smaller than a 4 lb lobster in their tanks). It was still huge a way too much food.   If you're sensitive to MSG, be wary, they pile it on here. I had dry mouth and trouble sleeping for 10 hours after dining here. If you plan to go out in public the following day after eating here, you may want to consider staying home instead, since you'll smell like you crawled out of a garlic pit for a day or so after eating here. They put lots of garlic in their dishes - but that's not a bad thing.  I'd come here again (and suffer the garlic and MSG consequences) simply because their lobster is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Funny story: A few months ago, a good friend of mine sent me a link with the message, \"YOU'RE FAMOUS,\" and it turns out Huffington Post published an article of Scarborough's Best Restaurants, with Fishman Lobster Clubhouse listed as one of the top, and a picture of me behind my family's go-to order of 50 lbs. of lobster (arranged in a ginormous lobster mountain, à la FLC-style) featured in it.  I can't rave about this place enough. Yes, it's a bit of a splurge, and yes, it is packed, but for good reason. We can't stop going back, and every friend I've introduced it to has been impressed.  The Good: Unlike most places where you have to compromise good food for good service, FLC succeeds at both. Servers here are usually very sweet and attentive, even if you don't speak Mandarin/Cantonese. They are also very honest and knowledgeable about the menu-items, even going so far as to let you double-check the lobster they're going to cook for you, and letting you hold up the live lobster for a photo-op if you'd like. Food-wise, there's a reason this place is heavily featured on Instagram! The way that they arrange their lobster (we prefer ours HK-style, the most popular way it's prepared here - it's the most flavourful, served with lots of garlic, onions, delicious Chinese spices, and little deep fried fish that don't have a fish-y taste at all) is nothing short of magic, with one piece piled on top of the other in a way that is pure art and a marvel to the eyes. Every bite is just bursting with flavour, and every inch of the lobster is coated with it, but you won't get sick of it and the inside of the lobster is still perfectly cooked and moist without being too chewy!  The complimentary dessert for dinner is usually black sesame paste or cashew nut paste. I LOVE the cashew nut paste and always ask for it! It's not overly sweet and just a perfect way to end a perfect meal.  The Bad: Getting a table can be tough, as this place is pretty busy. If you're booking for more than 2 people, try to call a week in advance, sometimes even 2 weeks. Also, for dinner, they only accept reservations at 6, 8, or 8:30, last time I checked.  The Ugly: The price, but it's worth it for what you're getting.  Bottom line: Forget Captain's Boil. This place is the ultimate seafood lover's dream, paradise, fantasy...be right back, I think I'm going to have to make a reservation. I'm craving FLC just typing up this review."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant probably 10 times.  7-8 times at their old run down shack and twice at their new well decorated location.  I will review the two times at the new location.  The first time was a group of 3.  We ordered a set dinner for 4.  There was more than enough food for 4.  The food was really good.    The second time was just a few days ago, so my experience is fresh in my head.  We had a group of 8 adults and 2 kids under the age of 3.  Looking at their numerous set dinner options, we decided that we wanted to order a king crab and lobster set dinner for 4 and a lobster and fish set dinner for 4.  After flagging down the wait staff to place the order, she informs us that each table can only order 1 set dinner and cannot order multiple set dinners.  She tells us that we have to order either a set dinner for 8 or order the set dinner for 4 and add additional a la carte dishes.  We all thought it was pretty ridiculous that we couldn't order 2 set courses.  The 2 set dinners were perfect for our group.  It didn't include things we didn't want, like shark fin soup, eel or oysters.  Also, we specifically wanted to king crab 3 ways.  So we ended up getting one of the set courses for 4, 5lbs of lobster a la carte, and noodles and half a chicken for the kids.  *Tip for ordering* - Unless your group consists of all large, hungry men, the set dinners for 4 will be enough for 4.  They will up sell you.  If your meal calls for 5 lbs of lobster, you will get just shy of 6 lbs...or course you will pay for the extra weight.  Pretty much everything that we ordered was at minimum half a pound heavier.  The food is really tasty for the first 10 minutes.  But once it cools off, it is significantly less tasty.  The batter (probably) flour on the food gets soggy and takes away from the taste of the seafood and makes for a somewhat unpleasant texture.  Also, the steamed fish was under cooked...the meat would not come off the bone.  Our meal ended up costing us $105 per adult.  I should note that the steamed king crab legs with egg is really good...best thing there.  No batter, just good natural seafood goodness.  The lobster HK style is good when eaten hot."}
{"text":"Awesome food with great service! Everything seems to involve garlic incorporated with it, so be sure to bring along some mints with you, especially if on a date. This place is especially great for large gatherings or parties, the atmosphere is perfect for it.   Would definitely recommend for seafood lovers!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most popular Chinese seafood places in the GTA area.  Forget about Red Lobster if you want a real monster lobster.  This place offers lobster 5lbs and up, as well as gigantic crabs.  Do not come here for other dishes as this is a strictly seafood house, you have the long aquarium surrounding the whole restaurant with large lobsters and crabs.  Definitely an eye opener for someone who has never been to a Chinese seafood place in Toronto.  They have dinner packages for 3,4,6 etc which is usually what I get, keep in mind this place is not cheap, you're looking at $50+ per person but the size of lobster you get is something you do not even see at western seafood places.  I have noticed over the years, few of their dishes are becoming little too bland but you're there to enjoy the fresh taste of seafood and not Asian sauces.  When you order your package, they bring out the live crab and lobster for you to see and take photos, this way you know you're getting a live lobster/crab and its weight is what you are paying for.  Definitely check it out and make reservation before you come."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and dinner. I have to say that lunch was a much better deal. The set combos are a great price and portions generous. Came a with 8 people and we ordered a 10lb lobster set combo plus fish made 2 ways with congee, noodle. We were all full and came out to $21 per person.   Food: Taste great, presentation is impressive especially when they pile up the lobster pieces. We saw some tables ordering dishes that required 2 people to carry it out.   Service: Waitress tried to sell us more dishes by saying it wouldn't be enough. Otherwise, all was good.  Decor: Nice, the arena of seafood all around the restaurant was interesting to look at.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BE60grEpomr/"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite seafood place in Canada. The lobster and king crabs were very flavorful. They show y"}
{"text":"Excellent place!  Very tight and crammed as its very busy.  6 of us enjoyed the delicious lobsters as it was recommended as the best in the area.   Very tastefull and good service."}
{"text":"Great must have experience!  Had the 4 person crab and lobster meal between the 4 plus child there was a lot of left overs."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS.   I'm a fan of all things seafood, lobster in particular so I had to give this place a try. Came here for a belated chinese new year dinner for 3 people. We ordered HK style lobster dinner for 2 but still had tons of leftovers to bring home afterwards. I had high hopes for this place given the reviews but was slightly disappointed with the meal. We found the lobster to be a little spicy, so much so that it kind of took away from the natural sweetness of the lobster meat. The batter was not that crispy, in fact, there were some nooks and cranies of the lobster where we though the batter was rather doughy/chewy. I love eating giant lobsters but eating a giant lobster cooked one way got a little tiresome after a while. I wish they would offer other ways to cook the giant lobster for 2 so it didn't feel like I was eating the same thing for an hour. The fried rice was nothing in particular and a little bland, but aside from that, the snowpeas were good and the soup was tasty. Four stars for the food presentation and service (who doesn't love seeing a big mountain of lobster??)."}
{"text":"I was surprised when I first walked in and saw tanks and tanks of live crabs and lobsters - really unexpected. We ordered 6.8 lbs of lobster, hong kong style and it was enormous. Food was very delicious!  P.S. The waiter brings out the live lobster/crab before it is cooked so you can inspect it!"}
{"text":"It's been so long since I've been to Fishman Lobster Clubhouse, but it's always a wonderful treat every time. The only place in Toronto that makes a finger lickin' good lobster tower. The walls of the restaurant are filled with giant king crab and lobster tanks so you'll always get fresh seafood. Place is always packed because the food is damn good, so be sure to make reservations. I also really appreciate that every table gets its own box of plastic gloves so you can get down and dirty without really getting your hands dirty.  We got the king crab and lobster dinner combo for 4 people which included: - Special daily soup (ours was blacken chicken in a ginger base broth) - 5 lb king crab served 3 ways (steam crab with white egg and salted egg yolk, fried crab legs with fried garlic, and fried rice with crab/vegetables in crab shell) - 8 lb lobster (we actually upgraded the size from 4.5 lbs) - Poached snow pea tips with Golgi berries - Black sesame dessert pudding   Bill came out to be about $400 with tax and tip.  At this price point it's definitely not something you'd eat everyday, but great for special group occasions.  Only downside of this restaurant is it's CASH ONLY, so it's a bit inconvenient to be carrying that much cash on hand for a single meal.  For photos, check out my instagram @alottleeats"}
{"text":"$59.99 for for a meal of Fresh never Frozen Before Seafood???? I am in.  My buddy brought me to this place last night. The plaza was tucked away east of midland on steeles, at a local gas station type neighborhood strip mall. It was located on the north west corner of the plaza and the signage was, well... dark and dingy. I would never have come here if it was not a meeting with the other family.  We were greeted at the front door with 10 boxes of fresh lobster boxes, just dumped outside the front door. On arrival thru the front door, I was facing a wall of fresh lobsters, with the tanks clearly marked A,B,C,D (to indicate the size of the crustaceans). Then, another wall of fresh bass, and then another wall of turbot fish and alaskan crabs.  My friend, who was a regular, did the ordering. He said the best deal (not the best tasting) for a group of 4 was the $59.99 meal and a fried lobster roe rice. The waiter was trying so hard to get us to upgrade to the $16.99 per pound lobster (I was told they make a lot more money as this combo is a loss leader) but my buddy insisted it was not going to happen. He told me he caved once, and they left like 1/3 of the meal behind because the lobster was so darn big. After we were done, the meal was $77 tax in. Not bad for a 4 person dinner.  Anyway, back to the meal. 2 minutes after ordering the SOUP came. Talk about fast! The lineups were long so I guess they wanted us out the door asap. Then, the fresh clams came. Holy holy holy mackerel. The clams were so fresh and tasty and so tender, it was like sashimi done chinese. Then the crabs came. The crabs were fried ginger and onion flavoured and it was, okay... I am not a crabby person.  Then the lobster came... it was done maggi style. It is okay too. Fresh is the key. The lobster was not the gigantic ones. I saw on the other tables their signature dish. My buddy said we needed 6 people to hammer that one down. Next time.  Then the fresh steamed bass. FIsh is my favourite and man, I destroyed this one. My buddy's did not really like fish, being north chinese and I being south chinese love fish. There was not one scale left on this bass. I ate everything... head, bones, tail and all. No complaints. Next time, I am upsizing this dish.  The veggies were okay. I killed that one to. It was your regular baby bak choy with mushrooms you get anywhere.  The lobster roe rice was okay. I wished they fry some belachan in there to add the flavour. Or some fish sauce.   4/5. The crab could be fresher... if fresher it would be 5/5.  The beers are $2.50 and $3.50 for local and import respectively.  Btw, call to reserve ahead of time. 5-8pm is impossible to get a seat."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for dinner and I really like this place. The lobster and crab are very well done here. Other dishes are well done too but the lobster and crab are the ones that stand out though. I would suggest coming here with a larger group as you will be able to get the bigger set menus.  A word of warning, this place is expensive and while I do debate the value of this place, I will still come back here for the food. I have yet to find another place that does lobster/crab chinese style this good."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I've ever had. Everyone that worked there was extremely rude and we felt we were being profiled. Food was just ok. It was not worth the money we spent."}
{"text":"Saturday \"date-night\" 6pm reservations with the hubby had us ordering item E on the menu. It's a meal for 4 ($420 incl tax/tip) but we love seafood and figured it wouldn't be a problem. Portions were abundant, tasted phenomenal and staff were courteous and helpful. We were proven wrong with the amount of \"doggy-bag\" of boxes we had to pack at the end of the meal. First time, best time, won't be the last! Next time, will be coming back with friends and family. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Had the best experience in this amazing restaurant.... Loved it so much. Amazing lobster mountain.........  What an experience.  I can fly another 5 hours just to eat in this restaurant again.   Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Lobster hong kong style is incredible (best i've tried)!!! King crab was also delicious, ordered the fried oysters wasn't good at all. Take out is not so organized, but service is still pretty good(cash only). Will go back for the lobster for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very crowded with customers everyday. (Dinner: weekdays and weeknights) Priority seating is a must and you will still wait way past your time...  Food was just OK.  The 4 stars is just for the LOBSTER. (I love garlic)"}
{"text":"Came here while vacationing in Toronto from the states with family. Decided to try it because I have heard so much about this place from friends and other family members. Oh boy, was it fantastic! Impressive from the minute you walk in to the wall to wall tanks of big lobsters and king crabs, to when they bring out your chosen main course still alive, to when it's beautifully cooked and brought to your table. Most importantly all the dishes was so delicious! It was worth the drive and worth the money. And we loved our wait staff."}
{"text":"Sweet mother of God, this place is unbelievable.  If I were allergic to seafood, I'd die - literally, as I would still eat here.  The experience in itself was incredible.  If you haven't been here before, here are some tips:  - Don't be dressing all fancy 'cause it'll be messy - Don't go on a date here 'cause it'll be messy and you'll look unattractive  - Go hungry - Go with a group - Be prepared to drop a lot of cash - Plan ahead! This place is always busy so reservations are recommended. At least a couple of weeks in advance.  Egg and Corn Soup - Can't go wrong with egg and corn soup.  It was hearty and delicious, though a little bit on the bland side.  4/5 on its own but 5/5 if you sprinkle some of the fried garlic goodness that will most likely come with another dish but most especially the king crab.  Oyster with Honey and Pepper Sauce - One of the best things I've ever eaten in my life.  They were a great starter as the flavours just wake up your taste buds for what you're about to experience. I'd go back just for this.  5/5.  King Crab - Was incredibly delicious! First of all, you'll be introduced to this alien life form before they prepare it for you.  I personally looked at it and thought, \"Yeah I can eat that whole thing.\" Yanno.  This thing was huge that it fed a party of 8, plus we had a teeny bit left.  The best part about the crab was the endless sprinkle of their dried and very toasted garlic.  You first look at it and think it's an entire family size box of rice crispies. Oh and this is the garlic I was talking about that I had sprinkled onto my soup.  5/5.  Lobster - We had both steamed and the fried (mountain) and both were absolutely delicious. They were both perfectly cooked. Ugh, I'm drooling just thinking about it again. 5/5.  Steamed Fish - Can't remember which one we had but it was also very good.  Would even be good on its own if you're not even interested in the mountain of crab or lobster. Just be careful with the fish bones. 5/5.  Lobstere Fried Rice - One of the best fried rice I've tried.  It came with big chunks of lobster roe which was so flavourful.  5/5.  Diced Beef Tenderloin with Garlic - Another side dish that you can have on its own or better yet, with the fried rice or plain rice.  The dish also did come with some steamed vegetables and all that wonderful garlic.  A must try for a meat lover. 5/5."}
{"text":"A very interesting lobster and crab restaurant. It was very fun to visit for experience but probably is not our choice of places that we would come back.    1) Soup - we choose  soup of the day. It served the Silke (black skin) chicken with pork soup. This soup is very authentic and tasty. We enjoyed the soup tremendously.  1) Food -  lobster taste is average. Typical Chinese flavor. Nothing we would call a wow factor. The lobster were cook perfectly right. Just easy to peel off the shell. 2) Presentation - lobster and crab display spectacular to hit your curious eyes. I think 1 of the reasons people come here is to enjoy the presentation of food.   3) Other courses - Young snow pea leaves with Chinese herb, steam fish all so so.  4) Lobster fried rice - not to our taste and despite the name,  there is actually no lobster meat in there.  5) Desert - black sesame sweet soup. Ok at best.  6) Environment - it's Chinese. Crowded and noisy.  Not a place to have a quiet romantic dinner. Interesting too see people hold lobster and crab for pictures before they become food. It's like the first time people ever see 6+ lbs lobster or king crab. There was a young woman sitting across our table constantly taking pictures of her food. It seemed she spent more time taking pictures than eating.  7) Service - above typical Chinese restaurant service but no where near western standard. I did not recall any server ever asked to refill teapot. Plates were changed multiple times if needed. A 10% tip added to the bill automatically.  8) Cost - expect to pay at least 75+ per person. We ended up paying 100+ per due to extra beer and wine.   The wait time here is horrendous. Make reservation is your best bet. We came at 6.3opm on Sunday with no reservation. Get a table reservation for 8.30pm and left. They actually called 1 hour before confirming if we actually will come. We arrived 10 min early,  got to sit down at the table right away. A+ for reservation.   Over all experience - it's an ok experience to see what the fuzz is all about. But there are many Chinese authentic places that suit our taste better without paying as much."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT. This place has definitely become a staple for my family every time my parents come visit. The place is loud, rowdy, and crowded. It's hustling and bustling the moment you step in the door and see tanks filled with lobsters and king crabs surrounding the central dining room.  Definitely make a reservation, and try to arrive a little early.  Also, come during lunch -- it's much cheaper.   The star of the show at this place is the HK style lobster. It's a mountain of lobster, deep fried and rolled in some delicious garlic and chili sauce. One of the best parts of its dish is the fried little fish and pieces of garlic that make up the mountain! We've been getting the B1 (i think, it's on one of the many menus they have) special, which is the HK lobster, stirfried veggies, and fried rice. Oh! And dessert. For a lobster 4-6lbs, i think it's $16.99/lb and if you get lobsters over 7lbs, it's $15.99/lb.  The 4 of us always get 7+lbs, and it's enough to eat another meal or 2 after the lunch, but it's a better deal and we can't help but want a massive lobster mountain to come at us! After you order, they bring the animal up to you (alive) for you to see if the size is okay.. this is also an opportunity for some photos with the giant beasts. Our meal ended up being just a bit over $150 (10% tip included in bill). for 4 people!! That's an almost 8lb lobster guys, for less than $40/person!! Don't expect the service to be amazing -- at any 'traditional' chinese food place, it's all about the food, not the service -- they bring you your food, you ask for what you need, and they'll get it for you. They're very busy, so don't expect to be doted on.   Definitely come by and try the lobster mountain -- you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Went there again. The third time. Their best flavor is garlic flavor.  I never order the combo with eel and oyster or steam fish. I just ordered king crab and lobster. Five people ate four ppl set menu. Came out $80 each. Good price!"}
{"text":"This is the craziest Asian seafood lobster place. I walked in and the first table I see is a 50pound order created into a statue like structure and everyone is digging into it with plastic gloves.   We ordered a lobster combo for 4. It was the perfect amount of food. The lobster meat is surprisingly juicy considering it is fried.   Side of veggie greens which was poached in water. Not oily. Just right.   Oysters were great too it had a light batter of salty duck egg. Very good little on the oily side.   Minus one star for the manager lady yelling at our waiting who was trying to cut the steam fish for us. Felt very awkward and he was new."}
{"text":"What's not to like than fried seafood? They do a pretty good job here. But the other dishes we had were not seasoned well. And service is ok. But if you are the easy going type, they may push you around and try to up sale you to more expensive dinner packages. Do come with a large group because everything is large here and expensive."}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS packed, no matter what time you go. We made a reservation at 9:30 p.m., as we walked in, there was still a lineup at the door with around 10-12 people. We arrived on time, at 9:30, it took us another 15 minutes to be seated.  We were 6 people but we were a bit crazy with the amount of food ordered but each dish has its own specialty so at the end I was glad we ordered so much among the 6 of us. I am not going to leave a long review in here since I'm sure that all of us had pretty much the same dishes, the signature seafood platters, and that they have said enough on these food. In summary, I enjoyed the seafood (i.e. king crab topped with crispy garlic and red onion pieces, steamed king crab with cooking wine and egg whites, huge lobsters, jumbo shrimps, etc.) and the quick services. Not cheap at all, but worth the price based on the quality of food. As far as the service, it was acceptable for a typical authentic chinese restaurant where service is usually not heavily emphasized.   I would not return again within the next 2-3 years because I felt I had enough seafood at a single meal. We've tried all their signature dishes. I would strongly  recommend those who have not been to this place."}
{"text":"The new decor, restaurant location and overall ambiance are definitely upgrades to their old establishment. They kept the menu, business model and pricing that made them the popular seafood destination they are today. The food and service is as good as I remember, even with the expanded space and a slew of new hires to their staff.   The lobsters and king crabs are put on display in front of diners as part of the experience. They take lobsters and crabs from the back and present them to diners before they are chopped up and fried, giving patrons a chance to take a selfie with their soon to be dinner. The freshness of the seafood is quite a one-of-a-kind experience that you can rarely find anywhere else for the price in Toronto.   The most disappointing part of my meal that brought down the score was the business model with which they pay the staff. I was told that they do get paid slightly higher than your usual waiter but all tips and service charge are pocketed by the owners. Not a single cent goes back to the employees who hustle and dash around to make the client experience better. During my 2 hour stay, I've had countless staff come refill my tea, change my plate when it was starting to fill up, make sure everything was okay and just to make sure service was overall efficient. With such great service but such crappy treatment to employees just seems rather inequitable."}
{"text":"Novelty place to try at least once. Presentation of the lobster and snow crab is creative and fun, this alone deserves an extra star. The hong kong style lobster includes a billion little fried fishes and tasted amazingly delicious. The amount of deep friend got a little overwhelming as we were nearing the bottom of the tower, suggest different styles of cooking like steaming, to balance the taste buds.   Was disappointed in the lobster fried rice, the roe tasted dried out and overcooked. Would skip this next time and just have the plain rice. The steam fish was also delicious. If you are party of 4, the meal for 2 and a extra dish is likely enough.   The place knows they're in demand and as such didn't hesitate to bring the bill and literally tell you that they need you out because people are waiting. Food courts have provided better service. For how pricey the bill was, it was a pretty cold ending.   You'll drop hundreds on the bill. You come for the food and novelty, don't expect great service."}
{"text":"Fisherman's Lobster Clubhouse has consistently served up fresh delicious seafood. They're known for their HK style lobster, which is chopped and piled up like a mountain. Not only is it delicious, but also very photo worthy. Their king crab is quite good as well. One of their best deals is the combo for four. Otherwise, this place is a bit on the expensive side. It's great for large groups, as I have seen crazy huge lobster mountains for a group of 10. Make sure you make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Service is ok, seafood is fresh but lobster is over cooked, vegetable has no taste, overprice"}
{"text":"we visited the area, and enjoyed our meal very much. Average check per person is expected to be high. However, it was worth every penny of it. Reservation is highly recommended. They email you, then call you to confirm professionally. The room was all full on a Monday night. Service can be improved but acceptable."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in, you will be greeted with multiple tanks filled with lobsters and crabs. The interior is decorated extravagantly with multiple chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and a column in the center displaying wines. We ordered two crabs that totaled to around 14 pounds. The waitress brought the crabs to us in a plastic bin and showed them to us. We were even allowed to hold the crabs up to take a picture with them. We asked for the crabs be cooked in 6 different ways(one of which included a fried rice). We also ordered two plates of vegetables and a sweet and sour pork. Everything was very good and tasted very fresh.  I would definitely come again to this restaurant. Be sure to make a reservation before coming because this restaurant is usually booked. (We booked a month ahead of time to ensure that we would be able to dine at this location on New Year's Day)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  I was happy at first and that's why i brought my whole family this time around for my daughter's bday.  There were 17 of us and they put us in two tables side by side.  I asked if we could move the tables together and they said no.   We ordered the 30 lbs lobster mountain enough for all us and and few other dishes worth almost $700.  The waiter told us we couldn't share the lobster with the other table and would have to pay another $100 if we do.  That's bs and we're not going back again.  We ended up taking home half the lobsters because the other people didn't get to eat it"}
{"text":"Food is beyond good. The different styles of making their king crabs and lobsters is mind blowing. There is a one menu I'd recommend to those who are going there for the first time (family of 4-8, doesn't matter really). There's a package where you get to try 5 different styles of cooked lobsters - and WOW, blew my mind away. King crab is still my ultimate favourite.  Service is good. I found a long piece of hair one time in our mount of lobsters dish. They placed the lobster by the reception area so that we can see that they are making a fresh dish of lobster for us. They are honest!  People say lunch hour during weekdays is more worth the money; cheaper in other words.  Forgot to add, you should always reserve your table in advance because tons of people go eat there. If you have 2 tables of people, you cannot share food. Both tables must have their own set menu course.   They also give you only 2 hour gap to finish your meal before the next family takes over your table. Dinner starts at 4PM, 6PM, 8PM. Those are the only time gaps available that was given to me every time."}
{"text":"Tourist hot spot.  Food is good but lilltle overpriced. Especially on set menu. It will always cost more than the set price."}
{"text":"The food is good but it doesn't justify the price. I tried the King Crab, HK style Lobster, soft shell fried rice. My favorite thing was easily the crab. (I will probably only get crab as the main meat next time because it's that good).   One thing that left a bad taste in my mouth is how they charged extra because the lobster supposedly weighted more than what was on the menu. It's such a scam because I have no way of verifying the weight. For all know, they could show me a huge lobster and do whatever they want in the back. Keep in mind that we took a 4 people combo for 3 because we wanted to try the soft shell crab rice, and the only way we were going to be able to get it was if we took a 6 lbs crab... and they still charged us more lol.  I would go back with a big group but it's nothing special... except for the instagram pics with giant lobsters and crabs and giant piles of lobster/crab.  3.5*"}
{"text":"Service is horrid, food is ok. The presentation was the only wow factor. The waitress told us she come back and take our order... goes to another table to get the tab then goes to another table to take their order. We ended up flagging down another one which then got another; 30min+ later because everyone is assign somewhere."}
{"text":"3.5 I have to admit the food were really good, but the service had lots of room for improvement, that takes 1 star away.   They really know how to cook seafood. I was especially impressed with he steamed crab legs with salted duck eggs(forgot to take photo), tasted very juicy and preserved the sweetness from the crab meat without overly heavy seasoning. The salted duck egg yolk were like icing on the cakes, made this fish my favorite from the meal. The lobster was amazing as well, almost as good as the ones from Dong Kee. I really like the soup that came with the meal, not sure what was in it other than the dau miu and goji.  The meal also came with one crab sauce fried rice, crab claws, and steamed fish. Costed around $390 before tax, great meal tho(*cough*instagram worthy), for 8 people it was just the right amount of food.  For their service, the waiter and waitress were throwing dishes and lack of friendly attitude. When our coup came up, the waitress only poured 5 bowls of soup and walked away and never came back. I don't expect her to serve the soup for us but it was weird to only pour 5 of them and left.  Also, be aware that tip is included in the bill, so you don't need to leave tip. They won't tell you if you leave extra tip, there's one time we left around $90 tip without knowing tip was already included in the total, they said nothing. So make sure you check the bill!!"}
{"text":"Incredible. U got here to indulge, not to watch your diet. My bf wanted to take me here after someone took him here. Went for the lunch deal, $17.99 a pound for lobster with rice, veggies, soup and dessert. It is greasy as hell but oh so good. The veggies are also really good and taste really healthy. We were 4 ppl and shared a lobster about 4-5 pounds. Total paid around $125. We had a lot of leftover- it still tastes decadent after a couple days - we just re-hear on a pan. Cant wake to take a group of friends here!"}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience this past Friday and was embarrassed that I had spoken so highly of this place to my godmother who was visiting for the first time from Singapore and very excited to try it out.  In all fairness, I'd like to say my 1st experience was great - staff were friendly and accommodating and food had the \"wow\" factor.   If you're a frequent Asian diner, you'll know that your standards for customer service are typically lowered once you step foot through a Chinese place, but I don't think that FLC should be allowed to fall under the same categorization as your typical Chinese restaurant. To begin, people don't just come here for a regular dinner out (unless you have a ton of money and no regard for your cholesterol) - this place is reserved for special occasions. I'm sure staff are aware of this, and nobody wants to be treated like crap when they're paying $300+ for a meal.   My godmother had asked to add an additional tureen of corn soup to our meal even though the set meal came with soup. The hostess replied quite dryly that soup is already included and we acknowledged that saying, we would like to order an additional soup to try. Her follow up was, \"It's very busy and I don't know if the chef will have enough time to make it, if you don't hurry up, he won't be able to cook your order in time.\"  First of all, there were 4 empty tables and secondly, if you don't think you have enough time to make soups during dinner service, then don't offer it on the menu. I know that corn is NOT cut from the cob there, it takes 2 mins to crack open a few cans of soup and mix it with MSG, corn starch and water. SERIOUSLY.  My husband asked if she could do us a favour and kindly ask the chef if he would agree to make the soup. When she returned, she said would he would do it (why wouldn't he?! It takes little to no effort and they make well over a 100% profit margin on it AND it's on the menu!)  She then proceeded to show us the lobster and crabs we would be dining on (they always do this). Except instead of showing us the crustaceans in the tub they're carried out in, she took the lobster out and threw it on our table. SERIOUSLY? It was rude and unnecessary and I know that is not customary based on my first experience and what I had witnessed from our surrounding tables. She didn't even wipe the water off the table after she picked up the lobster, we had to ask another server to do that before setting down our plates.   After that she told us we had to purchase 2 crabs because the crabs weren't big enough - REALLY? Because I didn't see every other table forced to purchase 2 crabs.  I felt the dishes lacked the WOW factor as well, food was heavily salted and the towers just didn't seem as high as others. Perhaps, this was partially due to the sour taste in my mouth from our terrible waitress.   Needless to say, I will not be returning here on my own accord and am looking for a competitor to try if anyone has recommendations."}
{"text":"This place is huge! Full of fresh seafood and anything you could want. However, the assortment of dishes is so much. It goes according to how many are in your party and this is not cheap. Be ready to spend! They do not accept American credit cards either so bring plenty of crab. I loved the variations in which they prepared our crab, but found a few of the dishes (the soup, crab rice and the crab legs with eggs) to be lacking taste. Overall, you're really there for the experience. People love seafood and it is apparent at this place. The next time we go we'll be sure to bring a bigger party to really enjoy the different ways they prepare crab and shrimp. Great concept, lots of seating and they try hard to accomodate you."}
{"text":"Would have been 4 stars but the server was really pushy. They have two evening sittings.  6pm and 8pm.  Our reservations were at 6. Once my wife and I got there for a table of 10, the server immediately asked us to order.   Since I was hosting for my out of town relatives I wanted them to look at the menu to see if there was anything they wanted to try instead of the set meals.   The server kept trying to up-sell the menu and recommended us to order for the 10 people set menu, when I had two toddlers with me!    Food came out quickly and every one enjoyed their meal.  The food is great, see everyone's comments below.  At the end of the evening when I got the bill they tried to sell the fact that tips were not included, I also did not appreciate that.  I always tip and did not like that.  Although the food was great the service was somewhat sub par and aggravating at the start and end.  Notes: Cash only, reservations required, make sure your lobster isn't over sized, if so you'll get charged extra."}
{"text":"Good service and good food overall, if not mad greasy.   I love all the fried garlic and presentation in general. For a Chinese place, it's kind of pricey...especially if you're used to going to a Chinese restaurant and feeding your whole extended family for under $100, but then isn't really your average Chinese place.   You should budget around $50/person here.   Came here with a group of 8 and had a combo for \"6 or 7 people\" that consisted of crab, lobster, fish, clams, crab fried rice, and vegetables (which, being the only non-seafood item, was actually really delicious and we had none leftover). I was left with a few boxes of leftovers; part of this might be because they \"ran out\" of whatever size lobster or crab we're supposed to get and had to shell out a couple of dollars for a bigger one.   I loveee how all the seafood we ate were all chopped up into pieces that you can just tear apart with your hands to eat (gloves provided). You don't need a special tool to crack shells or anything; this is seafood for the lazy!   I especially loved the crab legs which were slightly spicy. Every piece of seafood had so much meat to it. The only thing we didn't particularly love were the clams which were a bit plainer, and just didn't seem really flavourful. We were served that first, so it's not like our taste buds were destroyed from the greasier dishes or anything.   Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back here once I recover from the first visit. The seafood tasted fresh and delicious. Plus complimentary soup + dessert is always nice."}
{"text":"Absolute delicious and amazing services. Lots of food for sure. They supply gloves so you can get down and messy. Prior to serving they show you a selection of crab and lobster and are allowed to grab a few photos in with them.  The tower is an unbelievable presentation and it always gets me giddy whenever I have a glance. It comes one by one, not all at once. Fresh is always the best when it's out rather than sitting it out cold and bring it all at once. Very tasty, the head of lobster had the most meat. The best head you'll ever have!  Definitely a place to have a first experience for seafood in Toronto. High recommended."}
{"text":"Fishman's is a strange restaurant, and fittingly has a strange and unnecessarily long name.  Eating here was like entering a time warp. The dated dining room is surrounded by fishtanks filled with very large lobsters and crabs. Higher end liquor is showcased in glass cases in the centre of the room, and faux crystal chandeliers hang from the ceilings. This may have been a popular night club in the 1980's.   The service is good, but a bit chaotic. We were always attended to, but because there was no assigned server a few different staff members came by to see if we had ordered yet. Slight language barrier, but very practical for the Markham demographic. Not speaking english actually seemed more efficient with the majority of other diners.   The combos are expensive, but when you divide the cost by the number of people each order will feed, it becomes more reasonable. Our combo started with soup, fried oysters, deep fried king crab and lobster, fried rice, and cashew desert.  *Be warned: similarly to a butcher, you order a certain number of pounds of lobster/crab. When the lobster/crab come out of the tank, they sometimes are over the described weight on the menu. You are then given the option to pay the difference, or keep searching the tanks for more closely matching weighted crab or lobster. This overage added $50 to our bill quickly.  They do bring out the actual live crab and lobster so you can see or hold them with your family and take pictures, before eating them moments later. (please see my picture)  Oddly no shrimp is available at Fishman's.   Overall the food was average, but presentation was great. The quantities are big, designed to feed large hungry families. The experience was interesting, holding the live seafood first, then eating basically in a old aquarium store. Deep frying the seafood took away from the natural flavour. Beef and deep fried oyster were surprisingly great.  Worth a try if you're in Markham and have a hungry group craving seafood. Otherwise not for true seafood connoisseurs looking for a raw bar.   Had fun, but I'm not returning  Recommendations:  - deep fried oysters - bbq beef - ask for crackers to get the lobster and crab out easier - order a smaller size combo than people you have, the quantities are large - make reservations  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, food and service here. The lobster and crab are cooked perfectly and definitely not overcooked. The flavour of the HK style lobster and spicy king crab are absolutely delicious. Get the fried oysters as well, they are so tasty and flavourful.  It's a fun night out with family or friends and the food and photos are sure to impress! And yes, the service is also quite good - quick and attentive."}
{"text":"After longing to try this place I do finally got an opportunity to and well it was OK.  Anyone familiar with where Pacific Mall is will find this place a stone throws away on the south side.   I compare this to something along the lines of a Japanese restaurant where there's an element of the experience that goes along with your meal.   That experience I am referring to here is when they bring out your live lobster or seafood and show you before it gets cooked.   Many take this opportunity to take photos of their food before it gets cooked.   They have pre set menus which help with picking what you want.   We decided on the lobster and sea bass Hong Kong style preset meal which came with vegetables and chicken soup.   Like many photos already posted our meal came out stacked.   Nice and tasty were the bits found in the dish.   So tasty that most opt to take the remnants of these crispy bits home.     Service wise it was OK  I don't have high expectations when it comes to Asian dining in large metropolitan areas so basically I found it ample.   When we had some questions they did get answered.   Don't expect intermittent check up a to see how things are going.    I got to try the place and ro be fair 9nthibk I was disappointed only cause I hyped up this place too much.   I can't say however that the food was that amazing that I'd want to come back.   For me it was kinda like I got to eat there and it's off the bucket list which basically means it was alright."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 4 people on a Sunday at 6pm. I read numerous reviews prior to coming here, and came with low expectations.   We were seated within 3 minutes of arriving and were given numerous menus to choose from. We went with the set dinner for 2-3 ($128) which includes a soup, 6.5 lbs of HK Style lobster, veggie with goji berry, and dessert. We upgraded our lobster to an 8lb one (by choice), changed our veggie to a garlic based one, and added the lobster fried rice. I would say our choices were more than enough for 4 people! We looked around at other people and I think people order way too much for however many they are. Hence, the 100$pp price point. Our total including tax and tip came up to $217.   I was pleasantly surprised with their level of service: very fast, attentive, ladies came around changing your plates every so often (to clear out your lobster shells).   My mom was hesitant with coming here due to the price, but she loved every minute of it and wants to come back for Christmas dinner!  The only comment I'd make is that if you order a crab combo, that's what usually makes your bill rack up!"}
{"text":"come here with a big party and a big appetite. this is the finest establishment I've been to that serves alaskan king crab. come here for the crab, come here for the lobster. come here for a food coma. amazing. i will be back and i will bring friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. This is absolutely the best lobster I have ever had in my life. I've had great delicious lobsters in the past, but this just knocks it out of the park.   When you order lobsters or crabs, they will bring it over for you to show. The 2 lobsters we got are GIGANTIC!!!!!!!!! They take those lobsters and they make several lobster dishes with them. Let me tell it will get messy, so do put on the gloves they give you.   Every single lobster dish that came out, I was in lobster heaven. Fried, steamed...etc. The flavors are so incredible and absolutely wonderful tasting. The lobster meat are huge. They are by far the juiciest, tender, and best lobster I have ever had.   I have become spoiled when it comes to lobster now. It was an incredible delicious meal."}
{"text":"Got 45lbs worth of lobster or so and ten ppl only finished a third of it not only was the tower of lobster impressive but the flavor was excellent and for being deep fried it wasn't too oily $500 worth of perfection. Worth it but the only bad this was for such a pricey tourist attraction they ONLY take cash or Canadian debit how goofy is that?? So if you're american you need to carry a ton of cash and watch out in dark alleys"}
{"text":"My family and I hit the road and traveled up north, crossing the border to Toronto. I highlight of the trip was eating at the Fisherman's Lobster Club...the food was amazing and unique. Unlike another seafood restaurants in the states, you are surrounded by the oversized lobsters, king crabs, fishes, and many more seafood waiting to be prepared and enlighten your palate."}
{"text":"Hong Kong Lobster lunch for 2 (5lbs lobster, lobster fried rice, rapini and desert)  Background: With assurance from Yelp queen Jennifer that this place is indeed good, I decided to finally try it out while on a jaunt to the east end.  Discoveries: Lobster breath; and Scarborough's answer to Jacobs Steakhouse  Yes, this place seems to be where many celebrate a birthday (without annoying sing along and cakes w/sparkles) or a milestone, but there are many like us enjoying a family outing. Goes without saying you need a reservation.   While this place is massive and mostly geared for 8+ person tables, the decor is something between a steakhouse & an aquarium without being tacky; clean (including the washrooms); can adapt to parties of 2 as well; and staff who're attentive despite the frenetic pace at which they work the floor (100- 150 diners at anytime easily).  Cons: debit card and cash only; shark fin on the menu (loved it as a kid, before I knew any better....reason why I didn't give it 5 stars); no take out (they doggy bags though); 2-4 person tables might be more compelled to choose from set soup-lobster/Crab-rice-desert (latter looked like what I'd get at a yoga retreat, Rolled ice cream next time pls!)  Neutral: The food is FABULOUS, but it can get a lil monotonous when you are trying to attack that mountain of crustacean goodness; posing w/your squirming crabzilla of choice while it tries to make for the door; food coma; Why do they've beef/pork/poultry on the menu?!  Repeat? W/10$ corkage, food that rocks, good service & ambience, fun experiential dining and QPR (120$ for above meal that also was our dinner) will return again, for a special occasion."}
{"text":"You can get full with just the lobster mountain alone as it's huge! Nothing beats the excitement of the waiters carrying out a giant mountain of lobster. Both the seafood and regular dishes are good here and I definitely recommend it for special occasions. The service is average for a Chinese restaurant and I'd even say the guys there are pretty nice about giving an extra can of pop etc. There is even a box of little plastic gloves for when you use your hands - I even change it a few times during the night when it gets too oily.   The only reason this restaurant gets a 3 star is because the staff there will constantly try to up sell you on the lobster/crab size and look down on you if you absolutely refuse to do it. I've been here multiple times, and they will tell you the size of the lobster (as recommended on their menu) may not be enough for your party size. Or they will tell you they don't have a small size available (their tanks are literally filled with lobsters) and make you take a larger size. This is absolutely frustrating because my family does not eat a lot. Please stop forcing your customers to upgrade in size!"}
{"text":"I always expect horrific service at Chinese restaurants especially during peak hours so with my reservation at 11:30am I expected a hassle and stress free service. I knew it was going to be a tad expensive going in but I'm always for new food experiences so I was psyched. We ended up getting the lobster dinner for 6 for $228 because I really wanted that fried lobster pile I always see in pictures.   I don't really go to expensive restaurants because I regret it most of the time. I once had a $40 piece of chicken at the CN tower which is quite memorable due to its sheer mediocrity. We ended up paying $55 each but I was quite satisfied with the whole experience. Everything was good and as a lover of fried garlic, the lobster and crab was custom made for me.  Considering you can easily spend $55 (and a lot more) at a steakhouse, in hindsight, having lobster (and lots of it), king crab, clams, oysters, steamed fish, and dessert for that amount is all but fair. The presentation alone is worth a picture. I would definitely visit more often if not for all the cholesterol. You literally get dizzy towards the end of the meal."}
{"text":"This place never seize to amaze me. Been going there at least 4X when it was located in Steeles Ave. Dinner for two with abalone and shark's fin soup is q very good deal especially if you want to impress your date. I brought a couple of my friends and associates and they really enjoyed the lobster and crab dinner. Good quality food you get what you pay for. Looking forward going to their new location anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is popular for the wow factor. The display of each dishes provide a feast on the eye. Most of the seafood, especially the lobster are doused in spice such as garlic, and other flavourings. Just double check what kinds of cooking style are you ordering"}
{"text":"Stopped by around 4PM on a Friday, plenty of seats I love how this place brings out the lobster or crab you order and allow you you take a picture of it My brother took a picture with our six lb lobster  Since my brother doesn't eat scallion, chives, etc; we ordered the lobster fried - highly not recommended Friend loved the fried anchovies on the plate that came along with it  Steamed egg with chives and crab liver - tad salty  Ordered chinese spinach, can't go wrong  Sweet almond soup dessert - delish   Tip: Place only accepts cash"}
{"text":"It's always great to feast like a beast. This is the place for you to literally eat your hearts out. Super extravagant dinners with lobsters carried on a platter for you.  My family and I came by for dinner and ordered a combo 1 for the 8 of us and we left pretty satisfied. The quality did drop a little since I first started coming here (in terms of flavouring) but it's still good.   Would recommend trying this place if you're from out of town because not many places serve seafood up like this!"}
{"text":"If you're a lover of seafood you got to go here! Mountains of lobster and crab! So good!  Came here on a Saturday night for dinner with 6 friends. I made reservations at least 1 week ahead. Reservations on weekend dinner are only for 6pm or 8pm. I decided to go with the 8pm. My group arrived at around 745, we had to wait for our table for a bit.once we got seated the servers were quick to recommend which set we should go with. It helped a lot that we spoke Cantonese. We had a Caucasian friend with us and he pointed to the pictures he wanted. The server picked a set that had all the things we wanted.  We were Ok with the set. I believe it was a set for 7-8 people for $338. The live lobster and crab came and we took a look at it. It was a bit heavier than our set comes with so we had to pay extra. I believe they always do this, so they could get more money.  It was around 1 pound or half pound heavier than our order so we had to pay extra on top of our set price.  The oysters came fast right away. Then the mountains of crab and lobster!!! So good!!! Lots of meat but by the end my throat was killed from all the fried lobster and crab. We got some vegetables and fried rice was which meh. And lastly we waited for our fish. It didn't come for at least 20 min and we asked our server 2-3 times. In the end she said we can either eat it for next time we come or have $10 deducted. Both were not great options but when she was speaking the fish came.  Lastly we got dessert which was a cashew soup.  Everyone was quite full and we had leftover lobster and fried rice which we took away.  The bill came to around $65 pp. I think it was worth it for the good lobster and crab.   FYI Lobster is $18 per pound and crab is $45 per pound if you ordered separately."}
{"text":"Expensive...great food...sky rocketed blood pressure. All worth it. We got the 50lbs order. Will go back again with out a doubt. A great experience to share with your friends and family. Birthdays are ideal here and so are eating competitions with your friends."}
{"text":"An overwhelming, but delicious menu. This restaurant is meant for larger groups (that's when you'll really get the value for your money). For those going in a party of 2, don't fret. When my boyfriend and I went, we were instantly overwhelmed because the vast majority of the menu is designed for larger groups. But you still have options! We ended up getting their smallest portion size of lobster for the day (4.5lb) and ended up paying $85 for it ($18.99 per pound). We got the Green Onion and Ginger flavour with the e-fu noodles and it was really good! Their most popular lobster is the Hong Kong style, which we're really excited to try next time!   Our waiter was really kind and helpful, and brought out our lobster (alive) before it was cooked (totally not expecting that). However, the service was still mediocre. Because this place is packed, and has a lot of tables, it was hard to catch the waiter at times.   But other than this, this place is really good. Foods awesome, and you get to see live lobster and crabs floating around in tanks throughout the restaurant. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Holy crustaceans! These guys completely caught me by surprised, and AMAZED me!  Seriously. 4 hours later, finally digested, and I wanna go back already!!!  This place is constantly raved about on Yelp, and what more perfect occasion to try, but a birthday dinner for the family.   From beginning-to-end, everything was PERFECT. Johnny L. Was not kidding about making reservations. We almost didn't call in for reservations, and what a mistake that would've been. On a THURSDAY, and they were absolutely SLAMMED!   We ordered the Lobster & King Crab set for four ($288), for a group of 5.  Our friends have advised us of order down, because of the portions and they were nottttt kidding.   This includes: - daily soup - 4.5lb lobster hk style - 6lb king crab (in 3 ways)               - crab legs with deep fried garlic               - fried rice w/ crab shell               - soft boiled w/ egg - snow peas w/ goji berries - dessert (we had the sesame)  5 stars? Every dish was cooked perfectly. No over or under cooking. Meat everywhere, zero meatless shells, crazy amount of flavour, virtually no sign of grease, clean restaurant and service was amazing! I'm amazed by everyone who managed to take so many pictures; I couldn't wait to eat!!  As a seafood lover, I'm definitely impressed. Go! Go! Go! There needs to be a UYE meet here.   I will definitely be back. Seriously, can my family always do birthdays here?"}
{"text":"Must reserve! Unless you are okay with waiting or take a chance when you get there then go for it. The restaurant is big with a nice simple decor (asian style) There are a variety of food menu and a drink menu for you to choose from. Too much to choose from but if you cant decide then choose a set dinner. They have set dinner combos for customer to choose which i think is a good idea. We chose the combo D King Crab Dinner which is 4 courses and it's already a lot for 3 people to share. The menu tells you how much per pound it is for the crab, lobster, whatever you want. Tell them roughly how many pounds you want and they will bring the seafood for you to see and take pics with before they cook it up.   Our crab dishes were delicious! My favorite is the Fried small leg in hong kong style dish. For me, the fried rice dish needed more flavor. But overall the meal was satisfying and fulling. We boxed the leftover for midnight snack. At the end of the meal, they serve you a bowl of hot black sesame.  Reminder that this place takes cash or canada debit card! So remember to get cash if you are a tourist visiting this place for the first time."}
{"text":"Successful food adventure road trip to Toronto with the fremily! Was able to try 26 lbs of lobster and crab mountain. I must say it was worth the experience. They let you see and take pictures of the lobster and crab before they cook it for you! It also comes with soup, soda, fried rice, steamed vegetables, Chinese dessert, and a bottle of champagne for the table to share."}
{"text":"Wow! Upon walking in, I was amazed by the wall of live seafood they have. It's crazy! I have never seen lobster or king crab that big in my life.   This place is a bit of a hike from downtown but totally worth it. When looking at the menu, we were a bit confused as they have a few different menus. The server came over right away and recommended stuff to us to get the most of our money. We went with his recommendation and got the special that came with snow peas tips, lobster roe fried rice, and a 4lb lobster. We originally switched out the snow pea tips (we both somehow thought snap peas and are not fans of snap) for noodles. We ended getting the veggies and adding on the noodles after seeing what they actually were at another table. The server was so nice about it when we changed our minds.  Snow pea tips - we didn't go with the original method and decided to do sautéed in garlic. It was perfect. Very light and a nice compliment to our other items.  Lobster roe fried rice - man, this was so flavorful. What an awesome way to use the roe. Might steal this idea when I make lobster at home  Hong Kong style lobster- deep fried with lil fishies. Lol. The lobster wasn't dried out and was extremely flavorful. You can still taste the essence of the seafood. I highly highly recommend this style of cooking!  Stir fried noodles. I really do not recommend getting this. It was way bland.  If you go during dinner, Make your reservations people! We went without one the first night and left to go somewhere else bc the wait was so long. We came back the next day for lunch though and it wasn't as crowded."}
{"text":"I came here with family for a birthday dinner. We ordered a 7 lb lobster (steamed - they gave us a lobster just under 8 lb), flounder (steamed), crab (steamed) as well as E-Fu noodles and vegetables. All the food was very fresh and the seafood was cooked perfectly and steamed as we had requested. Service was prompt and efficient and reasonably friendly/courteous. My son really enjoyed looking at the fish tanks. Although it is on the pricier end of things, the quality of the seafood really made it worthwhile."}
{"text":"When I goto a new restaurant, I would walk around to spy on what other tables have on their tables. I also love to watch customers' reaction as they eat. As usual, when I arrived at Fishman Lobster Clubhouse for the first time, I did my rounds. My observation: Everyone was pleasantly enjoying the food, no one was talking to each other as they were just concentrating on their food. Main attraction on every table were: The mountain king crabs and the mountain lobsters.  The king crabs and lobsters are definitely the main attraction here at Fishman Lobster Clubhouse. The way they plate the king crab and lobster is an art in itself. It felt like stacking for a game of jenga. We had the deep fried with pepper and salt for both the king crabs and lobsters. We loved it. The fried garlic is definitely the ingredient for the success of this dish (I wish they serve congee here. The fried garlic would go so well with the congee).  Don't let this seafood place fool you. Their non-seafood dishes were just as good. The sweet and sour pork: definitely one of the best I've ever had.  I also can't kept my chopsticks away from the lobster roe fried rice and chicken with ginger and scallion.   Oyster with salty egg sauce: I loved the idea of the rich and creamy taste of the salty egg sauce. It was very good.  But the oyster was too rubbery because it was overcooked.  Coming here wasn't just having a good meal, It was a dining experience.  Food is no doubt exceptional but I don't think I could come here all the time...at least not for another round of lobsters and crabs. Maybe I am just saying that because I OD on lobsters and crabs!"}
{"text":"If you love lobster and crab, you have to give it a try here. The wait can be long so take that in consideration. I never thought I could ever get enough of lobster in one sitting but I definitely did. Get the piled high lobster and a to go box."}
{"text":"This is our favourite asian lobster house, they have great combo choices for parties of 2 or up to big parties. The lobsters are always good portion and we can never finish (when we order a two person combo for my fiancé and myself). I recommend making reservations no matter how many people because they do get pack easily. There were some news about the cleanliness of the restaurant and the ingredients used; however how we see it is...all asian restaurants are never the cleanliness role model we were a bit worry but at the end of the day, we think we will still return when we crave those lobsters :)))))))) LOL*~.  bring cash to save tax ~*"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times over the years. This time I was having lunch on Thursday at 12:30pm and the place is already pack!!! Would be hard to get a table without reservation.   Have the recommended lobster mountain as usual and it's still very good. Like the way on how they serve the crab legs so we can easily eat the meat. Also have the veggie dish but it's not the best quality compare with other Chinese restaurant, thinking this restaurant only focuses on their seafood dishes instead.   Overall, seafood dishes are always good but if you really need a vegetable dish then don't have high expectation. Also, I would recommend to have a large group like 8+ so you get to order different dishes as well because the lobster dish is very big that it's hard to finish with small group. The price is not cheap either!"}
{"text":"Chinese friends in the office have raved about this place so I decided to give it a shot since I had a big group.  We went for one of the pre-set menus with the chopped up monster-sized lobsters.  Everyone was amused when they first brought the uncooked crustaceans to your table for inspection and wowed at the post-cooking presentation of lobsters piled super high like a tower!  The food itself was good, reasonably priced for the quantity, and well presented.  The service was below par but was to be expected for a Chinese restaurant -- you aggressively need to speak up when you want something!  And of course you don't know what you don't know as they forgot to offer us plastic gloves.  The food itself was solid but not top tier.  When you have lobsters this big, they are not going to be as flavorful as the smaller ones so it becomes all about the added flavours.  We did scallion & onion for one and garlic for the other.  Both were very good but I still have a hard time calling them great as I've had better tasting lobster.  Although this place is tucked away in the Chinatown burbs (Markham/Scarborough), I could come back here again if I had a big group with many first-timers who had never tried Chinese lobsters.  They would get a kick out of the dramatic presentation, which was the most fun part of this experience."}
{"text":"A must have is the lobster mountain. Practically every table orders this. It's really good, even though it's deep fried, the inside is still juicy. Other places end up having the inside really dry. The quality is definitely there. Some combos comes with a bottle of wine but you can substitute the wine for noodles if you pay a few dollars extra.  Make sure you make a reservation at least two weeks in advance as it gets booked fast, especially on long weekends."}
{"text":"Lobster was tasty, but get tired soon and still feel expensive. 2??3??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????5???????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Visited their new location on Wednesday.Even though it was lunch time, still almost full. To make order a little bit easier, we had the set menu which came with a 5.2 lb Hongkong style lobster, boiled vegetable and a plate of fried rice.  Portion was totally enough for 3-4 people. To be honest, their lobster tasted much better than I thought . However their service was not really satisfying. Old Hong Kong style service, servers were not really attentive and can not speak English very well.  But it's fine, cuz most of their customers are Chinese and tourists."}
{"text":"This place is pretty special - amazing combos that'll give you towers of crab, lobster and steamed fish or eel. You get to see your lobster in its last moments before being plunged into a pot - people like to take photos with it, especially when they pick out a big one. The seafood is all deep fried with tons of garlic and arranged into a delectable tower of crustacean goodness. Come with a bigger group of people and you can order more!"}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday at around noon, and all the tables were filled already! We were initially told to wait a bit, but we decided to just sit at an XL table being told that if another small group arrived we would have to share (this never happened though). As a group of four, we ordered the HK Lobster Lunch Special, which included a 4 - 6 lb lobster in a fried, crispy style Bei Fung Tong, a lobster roe fried rice, and greens (dow miu) in a soup base. We also ordered a separate plate of fried vermicelli.   I was very excited when the lobster came as a lobster MOUNTAIN (I wasn't expecting it since they had a separate menu section for lobster mountains). There was a lot of meat that and was easily removable from the shell, very fresh, and a good balance between spicy and sweet tones! My favourite dish was the lobster roe fried rice! It had a lot of roe, was uniquely flavourful, and the rice was not sticking to one another. The greens was also delicious, and its simplicity was much needed in contrast to the lobster and fried rice. The vermicelli was pretty plain but of good quality. The black sesame dessert at the end was also very light and smooth!  The waiters were all quite attentive and helpful. They explained to us different menu items and how they were priced. Food was served all together and very quickly after ordering. They offered to change plates every once in a while when they were getting filled with lobster shell. The atmosphere itself and the plating were also very fancy, but the price was very reasonable! It is increasingly difficult nowadays to find a Chinese restaurant where all the dishes taste good at an affordable price!"}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant is too expensive for average income people like me, but most importantly I know how to cook, so i don't like doing there. The price is so expensive compared to the supermarket there for I prefer cook the lobster by myself."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Great food, and very friendly people. Certainly a wonderful surprise!"}
{"text":"Fried lobster tower was delicious. Battered lightly the sweet taste of the fresh lobster cuts through and leaves you begging for more.   There's really nothing more to say but put the gloves on and get into scraping the hot lobster and crunching down on the batter."}
{"text":"I came here with my family on a weekday afternoon. There were already several tables seated already to my surprise. The restaurant was kind of dark and old looking, despite the drab decor,  knowing from people who had been here before, I knew I was going to be in for a treat.   The server was very attentive and helpful in advising us what size lobster to choose. I suspect he was the owner or owner's son. We ended up getting a 7 lb lobster and a side of fried vermicelli and green veggies.   The 7 lb lobster was way more than enough for 4 people. We had to pack half of it to go home. The lobster was very tasty and succulent. The meat was very tender and overall it was a joy to eat the lobster, although I am not a seafood fan normally. Because of all the seasoning and garlic they had added to the lobster, it was fragrant and added a nice crunch to the fried rice that they had spread over the base of all the towering lobster pieces. Truly decadent and worth the experience. I would absolutely come back again if I ever wanted to have an indulgent seafood feast."}
{"text":"These guys play with the weight of your seafood.  My preferred weight was not available for my combo. They told me they had 0.2 pounds less one and 0.7 pounds heavier one. I told them I was fine with 0.2 pounds less one and will pay the same money for it. They told me they couldn't do it. I was with a date and didn't want to make a scene, so they kind of forced me to pay a lot extra for heavier one. It was king crab.  I hate when seafood businesses play stupid games like this. This happened to me a number of times at this restaurant.  Their vegetable dish was really bad. We could not finish them.  I have given up trusting them with my food and I will not go back. Enough is enough."}
{"text":"Fisherman Club House is in a small strip plaza on Steeles, east of Pacific Mall.  It is always packed and reservation is needed for sure.  Holy Smokes!! The Lobster mountain is to die for!! Super deep fried and super messy is an understatement.  We had a 8lb lobster and it was no joke as it was massive.  It was well cooked it light batter.  We also had crab, fish, soup and veggie.  Pricing is on the higher side as we paid close to $400 for all the stuff above.  Food itself was very fresh as you see them pull the lobster in front of your face.   The place is quite small but they have an outside patio for nicer days.  Service was prompt and they sometimes chat with you and give you advice on how to eat the massive lobster.  Decor at the place is nice as they have fish tanks with gold fish around you but the entrance was a little weird as it was fill with Lobster and King Crab.  Note:  They Only take CASH!! which is terrible since all the meals there is around $300.  Rating:  Service: 4/5 Food Quality: 5/5 Comfort 2/5 Decor  4/5 Value: 3/5 Parking: 4/5"}
{"text":"It has been a year since I've been trying to get a group to come to the Fishermans Lobster House. 2015 is the year! Let me just say that it is pure lobster orgy or heaven. Whichever way you like to think. If you are a fan of seafood, this is the place to be getting your hands dirty.  I had called a week ahead to make reservations for 10 due to the over bookings they get. I managed to snap up an 8:30 reservation, lucky me! Upon arrival we were lucky to be seated right away. First impressions? It was your typical chinese restaurant with the exception of an abundance of lobsters and crabs displayed in tanks surrounding the restaurant. I really thought I was in the movie Aliens vs Predators. It was very busy and I lost count of how many servers there were.  The menu offers many options depending on what you like, whether it was crabs or lobster. It was an easy menu to follow as they offer set options for different number of groups. Easy peasy! We decided on the set for 9 people which included the 12 lb lobster mountain, crab with ginger and onion, chicken soup, steamed eel, two steamed bass, snow peas, fried oyster in black bean sauce, black bean dessert, a few soda cans, and a complimentary wine.  We first got the chicken soup. It was nothing to get excited about. It was enough to hold up your excitement for the lobster! Secondly, the steamed eel and fried oysters. A little goes a long way with the oysters. After eating two I was pleased. Then the happiness arrives, which is the lobster mountain, crabs, and snow peas. The crabs were tasty! If you are not into lobster, the crabs another great option. The snow peas were good because it cut down the richness of the seafood.   The lobster mountain deserves it's own paragraph. Let me say it again, lobster heaven! If you had seen the look on my face while eatif it, it was pure happiness. It was cooked just right and so flavourful! Surrounding the lobster were mini fried fish whch added to the delight even more. Do not be afraid to get your hands dirty! Luckily they supply you with plastic gloves which makes it 10x easier to eat. Chopstics? Forks? No need for those!  For the budget conscious, this is not the place for you. Expect to pay a minimum of $200 ans up. Let me say that it was worth every penny. Wait, we don't have those anymore. Is that saying irrelevant now? Our bill came up to $507 including tax and tips. For a group of 9, expect to cough up that amount.   After a few hours of eating and devouring we were finally done. It was worth every dollar we had. I will be back.   On that note, I would like to apologyze to Ariel's friend Sebastian, but we ate all your cousins in one sitting. RIP. We will be back to eat the rest of your family."}
{"text":"To be really honest, I don't really know why this place gets such good reviews. The seafood was not very good! Lol. I don't know if I'm biased or whatever, but I think lobster and crab should just be steamed with butter, maybe garlic. Anyway, I felt the lobster was dry and overcooked, and the crab likewise. The restaurant is extremely loud, busy, and big. The lighting was not very good, and the staff are brisk and unfriendly. I'm not sure if this is true, but IMO, farmed lobster is not very tasty. Perhaps I'm spoiled by what I got in Cape Cod, but yeah, I've had far better, and for less $."}
{"text":"I've been seeing posts and reviews about this restaurant and I decided to bring my family here for mothers day. I'm glad I took them here! The lobster was delicious and each piece was a good size too. The king crab had a good flavour and I couldn't stop eating it! Everything is flavourful and good. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"taste good but lot of  water after  home. heavy used of MSG push you for high price set dinner as usual  and tips"}
{"text":"Have always craved to try this place.. and finally accomplished it!!  Fisherman Lobster is located around those plazas along Silver Star Boulevard (near Pacific Mall). Entering the place, nothing was too appealing except for its fish tanks full of crabs and lobsters surrounding the restaurant in full 360 degrees.  I came with a party of six and shared the king crab and lobster dinner set for four. As a girl, the total portion was good to fill all our stomachs. Every dish was served really quick too and overall service was great. The waitresses were changing our plates (full of shells) every now and then as it fills up. Each table was also provided with a box of one-use gloves if you're the type that doesn't want to get your hands dirty:P  The daily soup was creamy corn with egg white (chinese style). It was fairly light, good before the showdown of crabs and lobsters! Next came our 6lb king crab which looked huge with super long legs and 4lb lobster (which we witnessed prior to cooking).  The king crab meal was served into three courses or dishes: steamed crab meat with egg white and salted egg. This was delicious! You can taste the freshness of the crab as well as its pure flavor without being overwhelmed by other ingredients.  One dish was fried crab legs with dry garlic. This was amazing and the presentation of the dish alone was super well done. The crab legs were stacked up like a Jenga tower. All the crab legs tasted yummy, except it takes some patience to eat. You need to break those leg shells with your teeth!  My favourite dish was the fried lobster meat cooked in the HK-style. Similar to the dry garlic, they deep fried the little fishes as well. That part made everything super awesome and mouth-watering (even typing this I am reminiscing the taste of it). The lobster chunks were chewy yet soft. I didn't actually find it as salty as some past restaurant-goers mentioned. It's more the shell and dry fishes that made it more salty - though I still loved it! Mmm.  Lastly, their dessert was served. My first time trying cashew-made sweet soup. It was very interesting yet soothing to the taste buds. The flavour isn't strong yet it's a pleasant treat after a filling meal, easing out the entrees.  Fisherman Lobster is definitely worth visiting again every once in a while, but only when I feel solid spending $60 on one meal. For sure it's an expensive restaurant, but you get your worth out of the lobster and king crab."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Only take Canadian debit card and cash. So come prepared! US credit or debit cards will not work here."}
{"text":"Last Saturday, we were furniture shopping on Woodbine and Steels and decided to have lunch at Fishman Lobster Clubhouse. We ordered Hong Kong style lobster, it was nice and garlicky but certainly not the best lobster we tried. The restaurant is nice but we had very loud party sitting next to us, so it spoiled the experience. The service was indifferent and relatively slow. We probably wouldn't come back again, there are better seafood places in this price range."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is SO BAD. Especially the guy who takes the order. He won't even let you take a goo look of the menu and just keeps screaming at you to make you order one of their combos which for sure you will not finish. If you have 10 people, you should order the combo for 5 people."}
{"text":"Great food, pricey compare to average restuarant but worth it. Free desert after is bonus. The same waiter recognize us and greet us which make you feel welcome and that make you want to come back for more."}
{"text":"the pictures to this place speak for itself  I believe they close at 10:30pm, when I left just before 10 people were still being seated"}
{"text":"I went here for the second time, this time the same dish was a-Ok! Primarily the Lobster was undercooked! The fried rice was not as good as fried rice I had elsewhere in Toronto, San Francisco, and even in some  remote villages in China.  The spinach dish was the highlight this time around! It was yummy!"}
{"text":"The staff are amazing here - we had the chance to meet the owner and enjoy the seafood - lobster, crab etc. The lobster comes from New Brunswick (Dipper Harbour - I've been there a few times) and the crab comes from Norway.  Everything was fresh and delicious! The restaurant is amazing with walls of aquariums filled with crabs and lobster."}
{"text":"We went to Fishman Lobster house to celebrate an anniversary. Food was amazing, personally.. I enjoyed the garlic crab but lobster was alright. It's a huge portion we couldn't finish it so we had lots of leftover.   We were not a big fan of their soup or the dessert. Dessert was black and didn't really have any flavour.   It's one of those things you must try out."}
{"text":"This is more a 3 1/2 stars. Lobster mountain was absolutely delicious, as well as the abalone, sharfin soup and fish. King crab was a waste, it was bland. The service could have been better. I feel they were rushing us to finish to get the table. They should let people enjoy the food giving that it was not cheap."}
{"text":"I'm giving 1 star because of the shitty service I've gotten especially the lady manager! I can say that she does not know how to treat a customer as well as settling a problem! SHE COMMUNICATES LIKE A DOG! She tries to raise her voice and tries to scare us despite that there are other customers looking at us! It's such a big disappointment! I will never go to that place again!"}
{"text":"My friends and I got the combo selection which came with dishes: eel, clams, veggie, soup, sea bass, a jenga tower of lobster and crab, dessert. I never go to a restaurant dedicated for seafood, so this was quite an interesting experience. We were surrounded by tanks of different seafood. The decor was quite elegant for a chinese restaurant. The lobster and crab jenga towers were fried - and delicious. The other dishes were also very tasty. The one interesting thing that we noted at the end was the pound size of the lobster and crabs. When you order these dishes, the waiters/waitress will bring out the lobster/crab you will be getting. They will then let you know that it is 0.5-1 or whatever # of lbs it is beyond what you ordered. Makes sense, since you can't really get accurate measurements of the seafood. But this will change the cost of your overall bill. My friends and I spent around $55/ person, which I think is fair since I know this place is recognized for being very pricey.   In terms of the staff, I actually think this is one of the places that have better service. They were so quick at giving us napkins, handling our requests and taking our plates away. That's a plus. If you really love seafood and want to try something unique - this is definitely one place to stop by."}
{"text":"Why didn't they give themselves a proper English name?  They had the chance! Oh well.  This place has managed to maintain consistency in the preparation of all their dishes.  Since the restaurant has changed their location, I was a bit weary that it might've gone downhill.  It didn't.   We had four people eating a 3-4 person set meal with soup of the day, 6 lb. lobster, fish, veg, and black sesame dessert soup.  For just under $130 before tax and tip, it was well worth it.    The restaurant is round, with tanks of giant lobsters, huge crabs, eels, etc., surrounding the dining room.  Kinda neat.  I like the new menu set-up.  There are so many choices for 2, 3, 4, and up to 12 people.  Lobster lover?  They cook it in 4 different ways (Chinese style) your choice.  You want a variety of seafood?  You can get that too.  You can even wear plastic gloves to eat with your hands.  I guess it's a step up from eating with your bare hands.  This location has awkward parking, but what Asian mall in Scarborough doesn't? Make a reservation."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for HK style lobster. It's MUCH better than where we used to go for lobster (Newport Seafood in Socal), which had much longer lines and higher prices. We usually take out of town guests here, because it is so good.   I have to say though that my favorite part of the dish is not the lobster itself, but the little fried fish that are mixed with it. Those things are great, and the serving is really generous.  Tips: -if visiting at dinner, make reservations  -come at lunch time. No wait, and also the pricing is better (the lobster order comes with a few items, including fried rice, veggies, and dessert).  -the little fried fish that cover the lobster are delicious  Only complaint is that that it seems a little silly when they bring the live lobster to the table AND ask you if you want to take a picture with it. I don't really see the appeal of that, but maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"Came here many times with friends and family but this is the first time I write a review for them. Their combos are of great value and and well balanced, always have rice/soup/greens/desserts/other sides beside the main seafood you order. The seafood, no matter what you get, is always fresh and cooked just right. Best value for big group to order expensive seafood items such as lobster and king crab. Please make sure you are really  hungry when you arrive because their combo are extremely generous. Everytime we go here, it's a joy to watch other table getting really excited when the moutain of lobsters arrive at their table, and then excitedly wait for your turn to devour that delicious lobster. It amazes me every single time it arrives.  Service is very fast and efficient, like other Chinese restaurants. This is a great place to celebrate with your family and group of friends."}
{"text":"Lobster and crab was cooked very well, but definitely missing the steamy hot temperatures of Chinese cuisine. I personally enjoyed the crab legs, but the fried rice was below average, I wouldn't mind it being just a plain bowl of steamy rice instead.  Place is pricey, but a different experience, being surrounded by tanks full of live lobsters and King crabs...they are brought to the table live for inspection before being cooked in the kitchen..."}
{"text":"As a lover of seafood we made sure to order the lobster HK style tower which definitely was worth the wait and the cost. The fried garlic was a generous portion with the fried fish to add to the crunch!! Puts any other restaurant with seafood to shame. Will be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"The place had lots of ample parking, always good for a restaurant serving so many people.  We got the lobster combo #4 which included the soup of the day, 6.5 pounds of lobsters in HK style, veggies that ended with a bowl of black sesame Chinese dessert.  We were shown the lobster that was to be our meal before it was cooked, when it arrived it looked stunning, especially the smell that came along with it.  The lobster itself tasted fresh and very meaty.  However, as the dinner went on, the lobster in HK style tasted too deep fried and salty... (the salt flavour/sodium started to sting our tongues)  At the end of the dinner service my burps from the Hk style friend lobster was not a pleasant scent... Both my friend and I became extremely gassy after the meal.. (both burps... and from the other end...) We think that the oil may have been overused oil that was't fresh or the dish itself was just too deep fried for our bodies to handle.   The overall experience was nice, but the HK style lobster dish was not for us. Gave us extremely bad body reflex afterwards.  We may come back to try the steamed lobster next time, but not the deep friend again. The lobsters itself appeared to be fresh."}
{"text":"Went on a weekday, place was busy. Ordered the preset dinner for two with lobster hk style. Food was excellent. Service was good. Total cost $144. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The most disgusting lobster. Rubbery, cooked in what seemed like some kind of corn starch. We took the Hong Kong lobster tower. They make you pick out a fresh lobster from a bucket. Who knows if that's what you get though. There are tanks upon tanks of lobsters in aquariums lining the walls of the restaurant. The lobsters are literally piled up to the max in the tanks. Some looked dead. I actually reported this to the humane society to investigate as it is not in keeping with the animal welfare bylaws. Just a gross place with gross food. There was no flavour or anything appetizing about the food. We ordered a side of veggies which were just boiled in water and tossed on the plate, still wet. I've been to China so I know what authentic Chinese food tastes like. This place is pathetic and also disturbing. Washrooms were gross too. I can only imagine what the kitchen must look like. Not sure why this place got some good reviews. Maybe just the community supporting their own? Don't know but I would only recommend AVOIDING this dump. Can I give it a zero???"}
{"text":"My good to seafood house. On the pricy side and needs reservations. Service doesn't always reflect the price your paying but the food is worth the price tag. Going with a larger group of people is not so bad when it comes to splitting the bill."}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times before and every time we have never been disappointed with the quality of the food. The service is excellent as well, but when you're paying over $500 for your meal - you can't expect any less. It can feel kind of cramped when they're extra busy. Calling for a reservations in advance, are almost a must here!"}
{"text":"AVOID!  Expectedly poor service, super crowded, food is meh (signature lobster dish is OK) price is good but other Chinese places around here provide about the same value and taste just as good.  Just because this place is new there are throngs of people. Don't be one of these stupid ppl. What's the fuss about? CRAP. I want my money & my limited 2 hours priority seating time back."}
{"text":"Go for the lobster tower. It's AMA INFORMATION! Fast service. Great for groups and parties. They only take cash or debit. No credit cards."}
{"text":"It was quite a dining experience with tanks of lobsters and king crabs surrounding you.  Lobster mountain is good and so it the king crab.  Pea shoots are kind of bland.    I was shocked that this place only accepts cash (and Canadian atm cards).  We weren't informed when we made the reservation nor when we placed our order.  Having traveled to Northern Europe where only credit/debit cards are accepted to buy pastries, we were almost stuck with not having enough cash since there was a daily atm withdrawal limit.  Not everyone carries $600 around every day.  Even China is working toward a cashless society.  Is Canada still a first world country?"}
{"text":"Amazing food and seafood are very fresh. Our service was very fast even on a busy Saturday night. Highly recommend this place for seafood!!"}
{"text":"9/10 for the quality, 8.5/10 for the value, 8/10 for service. 9/10 overall (not an average).  Came here with a friend. Ordered the 88 dollar lobster set for 2 people +$15 to change to HK style. They brought out the live lobster in a bucket to show us. They also showed us the weight of the lobster (because the 88 dollar lobster set on the menu is for 5lbs. Any overage is charged at $16.99/lb, so they need your okay before cooking).  First came the soup. Pretty good. Then came the 5.25 lbs lobster cooked HK style. Excellent lobster but not as good as I remembered it. Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me. Still, 9/10.  The veggies dish I didn't try just because I didn't really care for the veggies.  The lobster roe fried rice was pretty good. 8/10. I kinda wish it had more roe.  My friend said it might be the best lobster he's ever had. He also liked the fried rice.  The server brought 4 desserts instead of 2. More for us!  Total came to 133.50 for 2 people. Like last time, even though the menu said it was for 2 people, I think it was more for 3.5 people. There were so much left overs! Good deal.  I kinda wish their menu had more choices for just 2 people. But no biggie. They also clearly indicated (on the bill and verbally) that the final bill included 10% service charge, unlike some other restaurants that try to hide it (yeah, I'm looking at you Shangri-La Hot Pot Restaurant, who tried to fudge the bill some more when I called them out on it).  Definitely need to come back again to test out the other cooking styles (should my wallet allow).  Also for those of you who are interested, this place serves Henessey XO, Remy Martin XO, VSOP, and Johnnie Walker black label (among other things, I didn't fully check out the alcohol menu). It is, of course, sold at a markup compared to just getting it to LCBO (I think Remy Martin XO was 350 or so compared to 250 or so at LCBO, but don't quote me on the prices)."}
{"text":"As most of the review say, you are guarantee to push to upsize your lobster. We had request for a 5lbs lobster, and to our surprise, instead of telling us they run out of 5lbs. The server really brings out a 5.5 lbs lobster... but one that has a body of a 3 lbs with two giant claws. Yes, two big claws that should been for a 7 lbs lobster. We said no immediately because I have eaten jumbo size lobsters across the GTA. Trust me I have been eaten 5-6lbs jumbo lobster in many place, that size taste the best. And in my experience, the claws meat is not the best part. Well, of course they said that's the only 5lbs left, I'm almost insist to get into the lobster aquarium to pick my own, if not my friends had stopped me for doing so. We end up getting a 7 lbs.   Not the worst but certainly not the best lobster tower to be honest. Many places in the GTA can make such a similar taste. If they didn't try to upsell me, I don't mind going. But for such dishonest service I will choose not to go.   Btw, we also ordered an oyster dish, the one with salty yolk. Such a disappointment, oily, thick coated, and not authentic. Totally not recommend that."}
{"text":"I don't know how to describe it.  I heard they always tell you that the size you ordered for your plate is no longer available, and you are almost forced to accept that you upgrade your lobster or crab, with with tips and taxes, means an extra ~$100. Note that there's no way that you can verify that they actually cooked the upgraded dish, you take it at faith that they'll be honest... This is the only part that I hate about this restaurant.  Their chicken soup is the best I've tried in a while. It's delicious. Their lobster and crab is unbelievable, I loved them, albeit salty, and a lil' too sweet for the crab.  It's very pricey as well, unfortunately, we ended up paying $110/person for it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited this long to try this restaurant! We went on a Friday evening and chose the 6pm seating. We got the set menu with the steamed fish, fried rice, wine, veggies and dessert plus the lobster and crab. The lobster was cooked hongkong style with tiny crispy fish. Sooo good...so juicy! For the crabs we chose the one with fried garlic. Sooo good as well! We hardly touched the rest of the food. It was pricey but well worth it. The set could've fed 8 people. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"When my Canadian friends made the statement that Toronto has the better Chinese food than America,  I was like, \"come on,  when we built the Chinatown here,  you guys were still in Europe\".  Well, I was wrong.  Toronto has better Chinese food than Boston, LA, and New York...  Back to the review.  This restaurant, Fishman lobster clubhouse, is outstanding!  We didn't make a reservation.   Big mistake!  (Please don't repeat my mistake). 45 minutes wait and people who came later than us that had no reservation got \" talk to the hand\" treatment.  The first thing I saw was about 150 people all having dinner together.  What a scene!  And all races customers.  The menu was fairly simple.  You have options in a few combinations of king crab dishes.  Prices range from $299 up.   We ordered the $360 option,  see the pictures.  Good news!  It's Canadian dollars!  The Food is Fantastic!  So delicious, the way they cook it.  Nothing was wasted!  King crab was cooked in 4 different dishes.  All memorable dishes!  I highly recommend to try this place!  Why can't we have food like this in America?"}
{"text":"Another one off the bookmark list! New location, it's huge with wall to wall tanks of lobster and crab ... impressive. We arrived for an early dinner, a resi is a must. The service was attentive, but no nonsense it's what I expect for all Asian restaurants. We had a party of 7, and one non-seafood eater, more for us! We ordered a lobster dinner that served 4, along with a sweet and sour pork. Plenty of photo ops!  They explained everything to us, how the price of the lobster is increased over a certain weight, they make it a point to show the weight stickers of the lobsters. So, a lobster dinner for 4 may say $298 on the menu, but the price will go up dependent on the lobster. Regardless, I like to be honest about pricing in my reviews, and yelpers deserve the right to know! In total $420 with a 10% service charge baked in. $60/person, with food to bring home, not a bad deal!  Now for the food, all the extras tea, soup, roe fried rice, steamed fish, greens and a black bean dessert soup were very good. Lobster was prepared 3 ways, I liked that our server said we will make them 3 ways, and  then you decide which you like more - leaving no room for substitutions. They know their lobster! Each cooking style was different, but perfectly prepared- my favorite was the HK Style! Let's not forget about my non-seafood eating bestie, the s/s pork - delicious!  So yes, this place is a must do in Toronto."}
{"text":"Oh man what an experience! Our group celebrated a 30th birthday - it was a pretty epic meal!We had the crab and lobster meal (2 towers and sides) for 4-6 people. It was plenty of food and very tasty; garlickly as the breading has garlic powder in it, and all the deep fried bits are actually smoked fish! We had some nice left overs to take home.   To be honest, the fish tanks are pretty sad. Yes, I am a factory-farm-meat-eating omnivore but there is no room for these creatures in there and it's not the best sight if you have a heart for any type of being! Sigh. Also, THE MENU HAS SHARK FIN SOUP on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Watch some documentaries and educate yourself on this controversial \"delicacy\" if you don't know how HORRIFIC it is.)   Do I have to return to eat here any time soon? Nope. But it was well worth the visit because of the experience ...aside from the Shark fin soup on the menu."}
{"text":"First of all, some people in the review said that the waiters/waitresses are rude and don't speak English.  That's not completely true. The waiters/waitresses are very helpful and friendly. For example, my waitresses saw that I haven't poured sauce that came with my fishdish, so she came to my table and told me that \"It is really good with the sauce and pour it for me.\"   Everytime, someone orders a lobster/crab the stuff let's you hold it and take pictures.  The staffs are very patient.  Also, they have 10% fixed tips.   Great place for a special occasion or treating your guests.  I will definitely go again, and order HK style lobster.  Edit: I went back recently before 5 pm and treated really poorly. Same price but I got some common corn soup for my soup of the day, and the fish was smaller than usual.   Ppl that came after 5pm got a better soup for the same price.  Don't go before 5pm because nobody goes."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  This is the best seafood restaurant I had ever tasted in my life It's a bit on the pricey side but it's worth the money  You can see the live lobsters and crabs in their water tanks. The server brings your live lobster or crab from the water tank and show you before cooking. I ordered lobster dinner for 2  It came with....  - Soup of the day - Lobster fried rice  - Lobster. My chosen Flavour was salt and pepper  - Dessert"}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago for a bday dinner. The restaurant is VERY busy so reservations are a must especially on a weekend.   The food here is pretty tasty but there was a hair in the lobster dish which was very disappointing especially given the prices that they charge. For a place that tries to pass itself off as a more high end seafood restaurant you would hope that some extra care could have been taken. When you order the lobster the server brings out the live lobster to show you and tell you how much it weighs. The thing that bugged me was people/customers would pose with the live lobster. I find that really distasteful and disrespectful since the poor thing is about to give up its life in the next few seconds so you can eat. Please show some respect.  Anyway on to the food.  Hong Kong style lobster - very tasty and I love the small fishes that it's cooked with. Eating this can get really oily and messy so make good use of the disposable gloves they provide.  Steamed fish - was generally okay but would have been a nicer touch if the servers would have deboned it at the table.   Lobster roe fried rice - really yummy. I like how they try to make as much use out of the lobster that they can.   So I would probably come back again given that the seafood is very fresh and tasty. However I hope they can be more careful w the food prep on the future."}
{"text":"I completely agree with the other reviews that say this is place is a rip-off.  A coworker spoke highly of the place and my relatives were visiting from the US so I thought, hey, why not?  What an embarrassment.  Maybe the restaurant got the waiter from a used car dealership, but he did a great job in covering us with his sleaze.  We opted for the $268 combo with a 6lb lobster, Vancouver crab and eel.  But wait, the waiter strongly suggested we pay more.  Oh the crab is all shell.  You should pay an extra $25 to get a larger one so there's something to eat.  You should also pay extra for a fried rice made with lobster cholesterol (ok, that may not be the technical term).  After we place our order with all the upgrades, he comes back 10 minutes later and throws a live lobster onto our table.  THUNK.  It's 6.96lb.  Ok, that's great.  Wait, we have to pay an extra $17/lb for the weight above 6lb?  It's not our problem if they don't have what they advertise, is it?  Oh but everybody pays extra.  Well what about something smaller?  Are you going to refund the difference?  They don't have anything smaller.  We grudgingly agree to go ahead.  The restaurant knows they've got you by the proverbial balls at this point.  Half way through our meal, the table beside us has two smaller-looking lobsters presented for inspection.  I flag down our waiter: Me: what did they order? Waiter: oh they ordered the two-5lb lobster combo, but those are 6lb lobsters. Me: So you did have something smaller than what we ordered? Waiter: See, they have to pay extra too!  He didn't even realize he was admitting to having scammed us.  Oh, and they don't take credit cards so we can go to the bank that's across the parking lot to withdraw money.  Their credit card machine \"wasn't ready yet.\"  For an establishment that purports itself to be fine-dining and where bills are easily over $300, you would think they could at least do their customers the courtesy of putting a \"cash only\" sign on the front door.  For a restaurant that's obviously so intent on ripping their customers off and squeezing a few extra dollars out of them, how do you know what other corners they might be cutting?  Some of the food was good, but what's the point when you leave sick to your stomach?"}
{"text":"Been coming here recently for many special holidays and occasions. Still not impressed with their service and quality of food presented.   Since they have moved to their new location at Finch and Kennedy Rd. Their portions and quality have suffered.   The lobster and crab they show you does not end up being the one cooked for you ! They give less of the meat once it is presented to you.   This visit we came we order our usual Combo e that has lobster and crab. The crab was leftovers or previously made the evening before as if it were re heated as the crab was dry as a bone when we took it out of shell.   Lobster mountain was more like a Lobster Bump from what we usually have is a large tower. Not impressed at how much they are ripping off loyal customers.   The inconsistency of this place is ridiculous especially at the price you are paying for this meal !    We purchased 3 of their gift coupons which are 150$/coupon but was onsale for 100$ each. They only allow one per table and must be paid cash.   I still never felt I had a 5 star experience or even close to. Some days we got lucky with our food and they gave us exactly what we saw in the bin, but mostly this place does steal your meat and $$$ and add old food to your meal.   You can get better quality and quantity at other restaurants too or buy your own 15lbs of lobster for that cost !   Good luck to whoever goes there next."}
{"text":"We ordered the preset combo which came with shark fin soup, lobster HK style, steamed crab, steamed fish, Chinese broccoli, lobster fried rice, dessert and wine.  Be prepared to spend A LOT of money as it is expensive.  If I go again next time, I would only order the lobster and crab cooked HK style as I didn't really care for the other dishes.  They only take cash as well."}
{"text":"Got to say that the decor and walls of lobsters, crabs, eels and fish, swimming in crystal waters is a seriously powerful statement about what the modus operandi of this establishment is.  It brings the highlight of seafood dining in Hong Kong front and center... freshness!  It brings a new element - 15, 25 or 50 lbs of seafood served in a tower - to the fore.  While the seasonings may not be to everyone's taste, the experience is very much centered on the family/group dining experience which has a wow-factor when 5 waiters come to balance the plate as they carry the mountain to the table.  I also love the huge grouper-like fish that swims in the tank at the entry way... it's blue scales are healthy and it swims in utter disregard for the humans coming its way.  This is an amazing place - that is unlike any I've ever been before... again, while the flavors aren't delicate, the experience and draw make it a serious venue for the serious food explorer."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. I didnt booked any tables when i went, and the waitress/owner (because i know her) didnt even look at me and said \"if you didnt book a table, you dont need to come\".   I have been here before, when it wasnt as popular or famous. they always upsell you the lobster or crab. You can never find a 2-3lb lobster here, it is always 6lbs and up.  Never going to go back, and never going to give it another chance. I will go spend my money else where if you dont value my business"}
{"text":"I am so stuffed. there was 7 of us, we ordered 27 lbs of lobster and just couldn't finish it.  it tasted so good though. after I had already paid the bill, their manager came back to me and said they over charged an order of fried rice that we had cancelled.  very honest and I appreciate that.    we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went there last Friday (1/15/16) with a reservation at 8:00 pm.  Walked in and the hostess was on the phone.  We stood there for good two minutes before she acknowledged us.  After we told her we had a reservation she just point at an empty table and asked us to sit ourselves there (very Chinatown like).  Not a good first impression. We sat down and looked at the menus (must be 5 different versions) and the \"order taker\" (I didn't say waiter) pushed us to order a set dinner for 2 for $138.  The set dinner came with shark fin soup, braised abalone, lobster 2 ways and vegetable cooked in stock.  After we place the order, the \"order taker\" came back and showed us the live lobster and said since the lobster was more than 4 lbs. we had to pay $9 extra.  Can we really request a different size lobster at this point??   Few minutes later, a \"food runner\" brought out the shark fin soup, she put down some silver wares and a shot glass of red liquid (we know it is Chinese vinegar for the soup).  No one explain to the customer what was in the shot glass and how to use it.  While we were drinking our soup, the runner brought out the braise abalone.  Now we had a soup and another dish on the table.  We hurried up to finish the soup so the abalone won't get cold.  The abalone was tough; either it wasn't braised long enough or low quality product.  While we tried to cut and ate the abalone, the \"runner\" dropped the stir fry lobster claws on the table.  Few minutes later the runner delivered the steam lobster tail and vegetable to our table.  Now we had 4 dishes on the table and we had to hurry up to eat the food before it got cold.  The steam lobster was tough (over cooked) and by the time we get to the stir fry lobster claws it was cold, gluey and oily.  All through our dinner no one check with our table and dirty dishes were not removed.  The individual that took our order never be seen again.  After we finished our dinner another employer (not sure what was his actual role) of the restaurant in black suit drop the check on the table and informed us 10% tips was added to the check.  Not sure if it is their policy to tag every table or they profile us as not local and tag us automatically. No big deal but not cool to tag a table of two.  The final check was about $180 with tax and tips for 2 people and they only take CASH.  So it was $90 per head for a very mediocre meal. For comparison, we dined at Yasu the night before had wonderful food and excellent service and our check was only $20 more.   After we finished our dinner walking out the restaurant my wife asked me what happened to the lobster head from the lobster we ordered.  They didn't serve the lobster head with any of the dishes; my guess was they keep the head and harvest the roe to use for their other dishes (a fried rice dish on their menu), not very happy with this practice.  This is borderline unethical in my opinion.  Overall, our experience with food and service was very poor from the minute we walked in the restaurant to the time we left.  Not impressed!!"}
{"text":"INSANITY.  After creeping thousands of pictures of the lobster here and having multiple people mention this place to me, I obviously had to come try it for myself. Simply amazing for any lobster fan.  The restaurant itself is crazy from the moment you step in. The walls are lined with fish tanks FILLED with gigantic lobsters and king crabs.    We opted to have a 7pound lobster that was fried with garlic and baby smelt. They bring the lobster over to you and you can hold it and take a picture if you want before they cook it and serve it to you in a legit mountain.  SO incredible and fresh.  I am definitely going to come back and try the other flavours they have.  I have my eye set on the salty egg yolk one! Ps they also give you plastic gloves to use so you don't even have to get your hands dirty :) digggg in"}
{"text":"My parents wanted to try this place since it's all the hype lately.   I recommend making a reservation so you don't have to wait in line. (Also go with a large group so you can order more items).  Everything at this restaurant is a set meal with a few a la carte items.  We ordered the meal for 6 that includes 7lbs of lobster, 7lbs of crab, a fish and vegetables. The amount of seafood they bring you to inspect is always more than what you ordered so you are forced to pay the different for the weight of the seafood.   The service is a little slow for the seafood while the other dishes came out super quickly. The waiter said this is because there's a line up for the seafood to be butchered and cooked (since every tables essentially orders a similar dish).  Pros - if you want seafood and lots of it and it taste good, this is the place to go. They provide you with gloves to eat the seafood.   Cons - if you want a variety of tastes to the seafood, go elsewhere. They only have two ways of cooking the seafood. It's all deep fried and cooked with fried garlic and the other taste is similar but spicy. So after eating the same taste that is deep fried over and over again, your mouth becomes rough and you get tired of the taste. I wish some of the set meals had other types of dishes to accompany the meal."}
{"text":"Our party of 3 arrived for our Wednesday 6pm reservation and was seated immediately, albeit in their patio area; very cool and 3 heat lamps were cranked up to keep the area warm.  We ordered 3 beers to start and decided on the set dinner for 4 priced at $148 which featured a 6.5lb lobster, sea bass and black sesame desert.  Overall, the meal was enjoyable.  A total of 4 waiters served our table but only one was actually friendly.  About 1 hour and 40 minutes into the dinner, one waiter was trying to get us to hurry up to leave because I guess they had another reservation set for 8pm.  He brought us the bill which included $33.56 for 8 beers.  They charge $3.50 for premium and $2.50 for domestic beers which for us should have totalled only $25.  Well, the waiter went back and forth 3 times to talk to somebody and finally $25 was scribbled over the \"white out\" original bar amount.  No apologies for the mistake even though a third grade student should be able to determine that it's impossible to come up with $33.56 regardless of the combination of premium & domestic beers consumed!  Final total of $195.49 plus a tip rounded up to $220 cash completed our evening.  I considered this meal pricey but the seafood was indeed fresh.  We plan to visit this place again but only order the (8lb?) lobster mountain (a la carte) and a few bowls of white rice.  Yes, and we'll make sure to track the beers again."}
{"text":"Maybe not a perfect place per say, but I'd still give it a 5, with the novelty and fairly good value (when coming with a large group) helping it reach that mark.  It's hard to top this place when it comes to anticipating your meal. There's something to be said about presentation, and when you see 2ft towers of lobster being served to other tables, you can't help but get excited. Oh, and they bring out the actual live mammoth-sized lobsters to you before they cook them.  The excitement culminates when your table's tower of lobster arrives. The thrill truly has to be experienced in person to be understood. The taste of the lobster is quite good. It's probably my only time eating lobster battered and fried, but it works and the sweet taste and character of the meat is still there. The seemingly endless supply of fried anchovies is a nice guilty pleasure, which goes well when mixing with the rice. Speaking of the rice, we ordered the fried rice plate which incorporates that 'brainy' part of the lobster, which is full of savoury taste. Veggies are okay, but nothing special. Probably helps with digesting the meal though. On my two visits, the desert has been average and then poor. I consider it basically a throw-in, so I don't really factor it into my experience.  Great meal at Fishman, and the unique experience - especially shared with a large group, really makes it a great visit. Oh, and the 'feeds x amount of people' guide on their menu is quite conservative and you can comfortably add a couple more people to that - and further reduce your bill."}
{"text":"Definitely come here on an empty stomach and with a lot of friends! With a lot of people, you can order the bigger dinner set with more variety! Their king crab is fresh and prepared well, and restaurant decor is pleasing for the eyes.  They don't accept credit cards so bring cash!"}
{"text":"This is a must try place if you're in Markham, or even in Toronto, if you're visiting. Great place to get your pictures in with some lobsters and king crab, and also to enjoy a 2 course king crab dinner. It does get pricey, like any seafood place. Plenty of parking available. Reservations are highly recommended!! And you get to hold the seafood before it's cooked to get your candid pictures in!  We ordered the king crab dinner, 2 lobsters and the deep fried oysters.  King crab dinner- this comes in two different dishes. They steam the crab legs and then use the crab head meat (whatever that high cholesterol goodness is called) to make fried rice. Both were fantastic. King crab wasn't cooked with too much oil like other Chinese seafood places, so you can really enjoy the crab flavor. Fried rice was delicious as well  Lobsters- this was pretty good as well. It was a bit dry since we ordered the garlic fried version. Would rather just get the salted egg the next time I come back or just have steamed lobster. It's only nice to do the non steamed versions because they're able to stack the lobster into a mountain which makes it visually appealing  Deep fried oyster- this was my favorite dish of the night. The presentation wasn't the best and it actually looks like a dogs droppings. But man was this oyster delicious. It's deep fried in a batter with salted egg and it was evenly cooked. Loved every bite of it  Really enjoyed my experience here and would recommend it to anyone who visits Toronto. It can get pricey so definitely try to get a large group and book a reservation well ahead of time. We were able to get a reservation a few days ahead of time, but unfortunately only a 4pm time was available. So if you're looking to go here during a weekend, I recommend setting a reservation a week in advance!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here when we have larger family dinners, as our family is a big fan of seafood. The seafood comes in large portions, and there are several choices in which you can pick what foods and seafoods you'd like. The crab and the beef sirloin is extremely good and worth a try."}
{"text":"If you love Cantonese style seafood, this is a place for you.    - Always fresh ingredients.  There are so many fish tanks in this restaurant that they practically act as walls all around you, uh, \"tastefully\" decorated walls  - Suitable for larger groups.  There are several set or banquet menus to choose.  We ordered a \"dinner for 4\" but we could have easily feed 6 people with the amount of food we were served, with some leftovers to pack home   - Lobsters or Alaska king crabs are the star attractions here, although the steamed fish dishes are well executed, too.  Best to bring a big party and order one of each.  - Be aware of potential up-charge if you go with a set menu.  You can always ask how big of a lobster or crab you'd get with the set price, and if they have the said size in stock (sometimes they run out of smaller ones)  - Make a reservation.  It can be packed on weekends."}
{"text":"We were going on a foodie roadtrip to Toronto and my dad really wanted to try this restaurant known for its great seafood meals. We called a day ahead to make a reservation on saturday but the only spot available was at 20h30.. with repeated phone calls they managed to find a 18h00 reservation which was perfect eating out with a toddler.  Make sure to reserve as we noticed the restaurant was still pretty full on a icy/snowstorm evening (yes we got the one of the worst ontario snowstorm weekend). We ordered their pre set menu for 10-12 people. We were 9 adults + 1 toddler, and ended with some leftovers. Which included 2 lobster and 2 crabs. They have a set price per pounds but if it weighs more, they will charge extra.  It was a pricy supper (make sure to check the bill as  they already charged 10% for the tips on ours)  but really worth the experience. We all said it was one of the best feast we had. The lobsters were cooked tastefully, really yummy but we were a bit dissapointed by the crabs which lacks flavor.   The menu also had sweet/sour chicken, filet mignon, veggies, fishes, fried rice/crabs. The restaurant was nicely renovated (I believe they recently moved to this location) with big aquariums full of huge crabs/lobsters surrounding the room. It was impressive. They also bring the lobster and crabs to the table for show prior to cooking it so you can see its size.  It was an amazing meal, and we are definitely recommending it as we are still talking about how the big chunks of lobster were delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Lobster that I've ever had!! So fresh and tasty ! They bring the live lobster to your table before they make it ...it means that you'll get a super fresh sea food! We had a lobster tower! Along with a steamed sea bass ! And vegetable ... A dinner for 3-4 on the menu... Will go back for sure"}
{"text":"This is my first time here, very impressive and the place is beautiful. Every dish came out delicious, tasty and beautiful. However they only except cash only and our bill was $800 Canadian (included tip and tax)but worth it."}
{"text":"This was my second time here, and the seafood was just as awesome as I remembered! We got the King Crab & Lobster Dinner package. It comes with a soup, king crab cooked in 3 different ways (steamed, friend with dry garlic, and fried rice), HK style lobster (the lobster tower you see in all the photos), snow peas, and dessert. This package is meant for 4 people, and is $288 pre tax and tips. However, because all their king crabs were larger than the size that comes with this package (4.5lb), we had to pay additional for the extra weight. I think the amount of food that we got could probably have fed a party of 6. I love the fried lobster and crab legs here, both are super yummy! This restaurant is definitely worth a visit for any seafood lovers!  However, the restaurant does get very busy. So make sure to call ahead and make a reservation, esp if you plan on coming during the weekends! The tables in the restaurant are packed very tightly. The round table I was at was literally touching the table beside us. So don't come here if you are expecting a restaurant with a nice ambiance, or a place where you want to talk to your friends in private. Because the table beside you will definitely hear every word you are saying!"}
{"text":"This place is heaven for anyone in love with seafood. It's pretty well known so I've never seen it without a massive line. They have so many set menu options to choose from. Although it's mainly targeted towards bigger groups, I noticed they have more sets for 2-4 people now, which is perfect for my small family. And believe me, their menu for 3 people can prob feed at least 4. We took so much leftovers home!   It's not cheap here but definitely an experience. Who doesn't want to see the giant lobster/crab they're about to eat dragged out to be \"approved\" before they're cooked"}
{"text":"Omg, so much food! The seafood is soooo meaty! Streamed crab and garlic lobster were my favorite, but everything was very good. Somebody else ordered so I don't even know the names of the dishes that we got... But the rice made from the crab juice was fabulous! Our last dish was a huge eel... It had a different smell to it, it was black bean sauce but it had another taste /smell I couldn't put my finger on.... But we were already stuffed anyways. It was still pretty good (the eel) but just not up my alley. I prefer it de-boned on sushi with that sweet sauce. The meal here was awesome, filled me up, and was a great price! The little plastic gloves to wear while eating are cute and innovative but I felt like a freak!"}
{"text":"Talk about a complete experience. We got so lucky - as we went right after work without a reservation and somehow managed a seat. i highly highly suggest that you reserve ahead of time.   I walk in and i stare right into the eyes of giant King Crabs- thats when i knew! this will be an experience like no other! Waiter was very knowledgeable and made the perfect suggestion to us. Hong Kong style Lobster combo with lobster fried rice, and a corn soup- also veg and dessert.  We were allowed to see the lobster that was cooked with a sticker of the weight which was a little bit heavier then 5 lbs included in combo - butt they weren't fickle about it. Service was pretty good as well, Not your stereotypical smile and jolly attitude. More reserved approach, as it added a flair to the whole experience.  So people who are worried about price, it was 3 of us and along with those items plus 7 beers our bill came to $164. They include gratuities in the bill, which was a shock but its only 10 % . So not bad. I think it was very fairly prices as we had brought home food as well.  The lobster was the winner , you are provided rubber gloves and encouraged to let your inner animal out. Was a thrill biting into the deep fried exterior but then get the moist tenderness of meat inside; REALLY REALLY good!   If you have been on the fence about this place- HOP ON OVER!!! you will thank yourself."}
{"text":"This place is like Mr. Peanut... NUTS!! Quick service. Huge portions. Tasty and has a lot of \"Wow\" going on!"}
{"text":"First things first: (1) Yes, it's pricey (2) Yes, they will try to upsize your lobster  If you read *any* of the Yelp reviews or talked to anyone before coming here, you'd know that, so let's just get that out of the way. This leads me to my 3rd point....  (3) but man, it's goooooood  Simply put, I've never had this much lobster in my life. Ever. There were 10 of us and we had the 10-12 set dinner, which comes with 14 lbs of lobster (done 2 ways), a king crab, fish, eel, deep fried oyster, lobster fried rice, soups and veggies so you don't feel quite as bad.   The amount of food here was absolutely ridiculous... and I eat a lot. Mountains of lobster friend with garlic and onion... it's staggering to see. You can get spicy versions, which I love.  Beautifully fried, it doesn't only look great, it tastes pretty darn good too.   If you're a seafood lover, you'll be in heaven. The oysters were served first, one per person, breaded and battered with chinese eggs (I don't know what to call it in english, but in cantonese it's \"ham dan\") they were fantastic. The king crab is served with egg whites, which was an interesting touch. The egg whites make the crab meat seem even smoother and silkier. The fish was your standard chinese steamed fish. The lobster fried rice was also really good. But the star of the show is clearly the mountains of lobster that come to your table.  The price of the lobster itself isn't so bad at $17/lb. It's the king crab that gets you, at $40/lb. I think our crab alone was close to $300. Quite honestly, we could have left out the king crab and we'd have plenty of food still, so next time I might order a la carte in that fashion. In fact, we took home two trays or lobster home (probably 1.5 lobsters).  Also, be sure to tell the server upfront that you want exactly 14lb (or whatever the set meal comes with). If they push back saying they don't have a lobster with that exact size and try to upsize you, just politely say no, and you can ask for several smaller lobsters instead, totalling 14lb.   If you get the set meals, you'll be spending $60-80 pp after taxes and tips, so be warned. If you manage to do the ala carte, it'd be much more reasonable, likely around $40 pp."}
{"text":"Came out here for my sisters birthday. My family loved it!! Once they came in it was jaw dropping to the floor as it was tanks filled with lobsters, crabs, fish and eels.  Got one of their set menus. Food was great. How can you not enjoy a mountain of fried lobster and fried king crab!! Should probably try to mix it up with getting one of the items steamed next time as everything ends up tasting the same.  Service was great, and accommodating to helping us put a birthday cake in their fridge and bringing it out when asked upon.   Highly recommend if you are a seafood lover!!"}
{"text":"After walking around Casa Loma for an hour, my wife and I drove 45 minutes to this place. I had watched an episode of Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern on youtube when he went to Toronto. He and Chef Susur Lee (who has a resto in Toronto called \"Bent\") went to this resto and I told my wife we should try it. The first thing I noticed when we walk in were the huge aquariums in the background containing all the fresh seafood (fish, crab, eel, lobster). The resto itself had the typical chinese set up with the lazy susan table in the middle. We ordered the Lobster for lunch for 2 which contained fried lobster (hong kong style), poached snow pea tips with goji berries, lobster roe fried rice, and a pudding which tasted like toasted sesame seeds. We wanted a 4 lb lobster bc it was only 2 of us but they said they were sold out.  So, we asked for the cheapest lobster they had and they gave us a 5 lb and some ounces lobster. They even showed us our lobster to take a pic. The first thing that came out was the \"mountain\" of fried lobster and then the veges and the fried rice. The fried lobster was probably the best fried dish I've ever tasted. It had a great balance of sweet and spicy. The snow pea tips were ok as they were on the watery side. The lobster fried rice was great. It was not salty and the innards of the lobster were delicious. The dessert tasted like \"toasted sesame seed\" paradosdos (filipino reference!) and not too sweet. There are 3 things to note however. 1) Prices here are pretty high here  (over $60 easily) so its better if you come here with a group. They automatically add 10% for service which I assume is to maintain those aquariums. 2) They brought out the fried lobster (the main dish) first which I don't mind but I think bringing it to the table last would've been better. 3)  My wife mentioned to me after we finished that you really wouldn't know for sure if the lobster/crab you ate was actually the lobster/crab you ordered. Overall, the food tastes really good and is a good resto to come with a hungry group."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come with a big group to consume massive amounts of Seafood and delicious chinese dishes. Make sure you bring your wallet full of cash because you will need it. This place is not cheap at all.  However...you do get what you pay for here. The lobsters are massive and the crabs are huge!  When the lobster comes you need to put on gloves to eat it so you do not make a big mess.  I suggest coming here with an adjustable belt or sweat pants to help you consume as much food as possible.  The service is great and they are all attentive to your needs. Plates are moved off the table quickly, water is refilled efficiently, and they make sure to get your order right. The average bill people spend here is easily over $100 so you would expect the service to be great.  Come here for the Lobsters and Crab and you will not be disappointed.  Eat lots and enjoy your experience!"}
{"text":"If you look up gluttony in the dictionary, there is probably a picture of Fishman Lobster Clubhouse.  This place is a seafood extravaganza, but the focus is lobster and Alaskan king crab.  This place is great for bringing out of town guests that you want to impress.  Wall to wall fish tanks full of lobsters and crab, it is quite an impressive sight!  Been here a few times now, and to start, you will always end up ordering too much food!  These guys are masters of upselling, which is quite annoying.  If you ask for 5 lb lobster, they will bring you 7 lb.  If you ask for 8 lb, they will bring you 10 lb.  Keep that in mind when ordering!  After you order, they will bring you the lobster/crab to your table.  Here you can take your Instagram photos with the shellfish to make all your friends jealous.  Don't worry, you won't be the only ones posing with lobsters, this is happening at every table so feel free to strike a pose!  Now onto the food - this review will focus on the lobster and crab.  Yes, they have other items on the menu, but who cares.  They are just filler.  The lobster and crab will be done a few ways, of your choice.  The tail and legs can be done Hong Kong style, dried garlic, poached, steamed, Maggi sauce, salted egg yolk, etc.  Just choose what you like, you can't go wrong with any of the fried options ;)  Lobster left overs are done with steam egg and roe or fried rice.  Then to food comes, assembled nicely into giant towers.  It's quite a spectacle, as you can see from the hundreds of Yelp photos.  The larger the lobster/crab, the taller the tower.  It's like tasty food Jenga.  Eat to your hearts content, your cholesterol level will jump a few points by the end of the meal as you struggle to eat one more tail.  Tip #1: Make sure you use the gloves.  My expert technique is to quadruple glove (yes 4 layers) your non dominant hand.  Use this hand to handle the shellfish while your dominant hand is available to use chopsticks!  You can thank me later.  Tip #2: Bring cash and make reservations!  You must come in a large group to try more."}
{"text":"Came twice and after the second visit I decided to write this review,   ALWAYS MAKE A RESERVATION !   Anyways, the food was amazing the first time I came but after the second visit I found it a bit bland, maybe because we came Ina group of 4-5 tables but that shouldn't hurt the quantity of the food since this is considered a upper scale Chinese seafood restaurant.   The service was good they frequently change your plates since it gets full of lobster and crab shells.   Yes it's expensive but it's worth it, in terms of Toronto-Based Chinese seafood restaurants it's one of the better ones. I would come again but only for special events such as birthdays or out of town family visits."}
{"text":"When you end up ordering a dinner where the main dish has to be carried out by two men as if their handling the Stanley Cup and it's a 27 pound platter of a pyramid of fried lobster and it's not the most expensive thing on the menu... well perhaps you get the picture.  If not feel free to browse the photos - the photos which really can't do justice.  To really experience this place you can't just observe a two dimensional image or even fully comprehend it with a video because you simply have to see it for yourself and actually dine here.  My friend Johnny made a reservation for a group of us to have an evening out in the east part of Toronto.  This place is just a few blocks east of Pacific Mall but is on the south side of  Steeles so this establishment is technically on the Toronto side of the border.  With a dozen friends willing to combine resources we were able to pull off quite the meal which was family style and included a bottle of wine, a couple plates of rice, soup, some vegetables, a warm nut dessert and some pretty impressive service on top of that - oh and that mountain of lobster as well.  We were actually brought the lobster to look at before it was prepared.  As if we're marine biologists we were given the opportunity to inspect the crustaceans first hand.  If we wanted we could have handled them and looked at them prior to accepting these tasty victims which were imminently destined to be our fare in the next short while.  None of us bothered to actually pick them up and check but we did have the opportunity to do so.  Other tables were taking selfies with their huge king crabs that were brought to them which was sort of something you don't see every day.    When it comes down to it, this place is not all show.  The food is pretty impressive and it's not just the size, spectacle or grandiose display of parade after parade of superfluous platters of seafood being brought out from the kitchen to tables throughout the dining area.  The servers are very professional and precise.  You have to be when you're looking after large parties which every table basically is.  Our table for 12 was very comfortable and we were not squeezed in the least.  This table was intended for such a party and the convenience of having a lazy Susan with an appropriate diameter made sharing easier among everybody.  There is a box of disposable gloves on the table so you can eat with your hands but without having to get too messy.  The lobster platter brought to us were huge creatures indeed arranged in such an attractive way that if you have somehow forgotten that man is on the top of the food chain this will be a sober reminder that we rule this planet.  This platter is not humble and could be considered over the top.  I mean it's a lot of food but I suppose it's how one perceives this meal.  I look at it as a celebration of good times not an obscene overindulgence.    The pieces were cut into manageable sizes that could be handled properly when taking from the pyramid.  The entire dish perhaps had a diameter of 3 feet or so.  The pyramid rested on what appeared to be a bed of fried anchovies or some other tiny fish too small to recognize.  Yes thousands of tiny fish were used as dressing...  the mountain was topped with slaw of some kind and both heads peeked out of the pile.  The pieces had a batter that gave it taste with some bits of chili and other spices to add flavor.  The meat was very moist and not rubbery or tough at all.  I wasn't sure what to expect because most whole lobster I've ever had have been about 2 pounds or less range.  These creatures well exceeded that former threshold.  The shells were cracked in such a way it wasn't very hard to get to the meat of all the pieces I had eaten.  Everything else besides the showcase platter was good but the lobster was fantastic.  I have to just think we only had the lobster and no crab.  That's another level altogether.  The meal we had was 388 dollars and when added tax, tip and divided by 12 patrons it worked out to be just over 41 dollars each.  That is really an amazing deal considering the feast we shared over a two hour dinner.    This is definitely a place for family style eating and they specialize in groups.  Considering how many patrons they had on a Wednesday evening and the place being at capacity they served quickly, efficiently and absolutely know what they are doing as far as servicing a full dining room.  I did not feel we were lacking anything at any time as they came around to refill drinks and exchange plates and/or take away shells, etc.    This is one of the coolest places to eat that I've been to in my hometown in a while and I'm surprised it's not more famous or has celebrity chefs coming for a visit."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is definitely a tourist trap kind of restaurant. I've been hearing about the hype for a long time with the lobster mountain and I definitely was hyped when I finally got a chance to try. However reality kicked in and it definitely doesn't live up to the hype from my peers.  Food: I'm a big stickler for seasoning and in my opinion I personally found the lobster and crab to be a bit bland. While I do like eating lobster and crab, I definitely found it slightly underwhelming.   Personally the thing that I enjoyed the most was the deep fried fishes that are placed on the side of each of the platters.   Service: Banquet style service, very little interaction but was able to get the job done. Water top ups were frequent. Nothing over the top that would make me say I got excellent service, but I would say it's something I expected from a establishment such as this.  Ambiance: Open room concept that is your typical banquet hall style restaurant. It can get quite noisy so don't expect to have a intimate conversation with someone. Going with groups and family is the ideal for a restaurant such as this.  Recommendation: I personally cannot recommend this restaurant if your going out to eat on the whim or trying to get inspired on cuisine. However I would recommend if your going for a family dinner. Again this place is definitely over hyped."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why this place gets such high ratings other than the fact that other than Red Lobster there is no competition within the Scarborough/Markham borders.  We were a party of 11 and ordered the set menu for 10.  Unfortunately they had sold out of Sea Bass (which was supposed to be part of the set menu) and they gave us cheaper substitutes: Sweet & Sour Pork, and a Beef, Cashew, Mushroom & Green Beans Stir-Fry.  I felt ripped off.  Shark Fin Soup - Soup base was crap. Flavourless. The crab meat in it was bland. However as other Yelpers mentioned, they were generous with the shark fin. The soups come out in individual portions. We had to ask for the vinegar and pepper.  That's like going to a burger joint and having to ask for ketchup and mustard.    Clams in Beer - This was probably my favourite dish because it was not drowned in oil or complicated condiments.  It allowed the natural juices of the clam to come through, and it was nice and light.    Lobster w/ Deep Fried Garlic - If I were ever to be hunted by vampires, I would run for shelter to Fisherman's Clubhouse.  The heaps of fried garlic that accompanied the also fried lobster was offensive.  If I were to go to the gas station to pick up a stick of gum, the cashier would probably take advantage of my desperate need for a chewing stick and jack up the prices 10 fold on the spot.    Dungeness Crab w/ Fried Sardines - Between the lobster and the crab, the crab definitely had more flavour to it.  It had what we Chinese call \"seen may\" which alludes to the natural flavours of seafood.  The crab innards were extremely yummy and half of it was reserved for the fried rice.  Black Bean Sauce Braised Eel - When a non-deep-fried dish finally found its way to the table I was so excited.  However, I am not a big fan of eel and found it to have a bit of a bitter taste to it.  Again, I iterate I am not a big fan of eel. In fact this was the first time I had tried eel.  Fried Oyster w/ Salted Egg Yolk - At this point, I could already feel my own innards weighed down in oil from all the deep-fried dishes that arrived at our table.  The oyster was an extremely HEAVY dish.  Upon biting, I swear a fountain of oil spurted out from my oyster.  I did however, like the application of the salted egg yolk as it served as a great flavour enhancer.  Crab Fried Rice - This was an extremely tasty fried rice, however, the portion size was definitely not enough for 10 individual servings.    Pea Shoots & King Mushroom Stir-Fry - A vegetable at last!  If you ignore the high sheen that came from the oil that slathered the dish, this was quite tasty and hey, it was a veg!  Neither the Sweet & Sour Pork nor the Beef, Cashew, Green Bean & Mushroom Stir Fry were Yelp worthy.  The sauce for the pork was way too sweet - I felt like I was drinking syrup.    The complimentary dessert was a Black Sesame Sweet Soup.  It was extremely sweet, and not thick enough in consistency.    Verdict: I have always believed that seafood is best served either braised or steamed to really taste the natural flavours of the seafood.  I find that deep frying seafood actually destroys the natural flavours.  The lobster that we had was 9lbs. as I mentioned, and the bigger the lobster, the older the lobster, which means, IMHO the less tasty is the lobster meat.  I would definitely opt for smaller lobsters (e.g. no larger than 5lbs. each) instead of one big one.  The dishes that really stood out for me would be the Crab Fried Rice, the Dungeness Crab as well as the Deep Fried Oysters.    This place would be interesting to go to once, just to gorge on seafood.  However, if you want quality, I would go someplace else.  I was there for dinner last night, it is now the next morning.  My stomach is doing unpleasant things to me This morning I didn't even have breakfast because I still feel so full and bloated.  It is now 10:30AM and all I've had are 3 cups of water.  The sad part is, I've felt healthier eating a Big Mac.   From a service perspective, they are okay.  However, I think that one thing that was missing, which to me, was essential when you're peeling crab and lobster with your hands is wet naps or at least a bowl of lemon water so that we can clean our hands.   When we inquired about wine, they indicated that they only had red wine available.  What?!  Since when did red wine replace white wine as the wine pairing for seafood?  If you do decide to try this place out, make sure you have reservations as they are extremely busy and the restaurant itself is small.  They have 2 different classes of lobster.  You obviously have to dole out extra if you want the better one.  We did just that, but still, because of the age of the lobster, the meat was not very succulent, and clung to the shell.  The bill came to about $55 per person including tax and tip ($605).    Parking is also an issue as the plaza is rather small and shared with other tenants."}
{"text":"I love the food. The presentation was wonderful. Its was too crowded. The staff were not too accommodating, some were just rude. Lucky you have good food."}
{"text":"So after all the good reviews I decided to come here with my family.  I have been eating at Chinese restaurants in Toronto for the last 30 years and usually my food all came around the same time but instead at this place we had to wait for each plate about food to come out and it was slow not only that our fish didn't come until our mail was almost over.  So halfway through our meal we found a hair dug deep inside our lobster. We call the manager to come over and he inspected the hair like a e put it in there and then he said nothing not even a sorry. then my friend asked him if he's going to give us a discount since there s hair in our food. He say \"no, I can give you your pop for free\". I knew Chinese restaurant never do anything about this and I told my friend so beforehand but what he just said was so fucking disrespectful and it got me instantly upset so I told them I won't let them charge me for service fee. It's so ridiculous that they would put that automatically on the bill, that's why I got the shitty service.  I can't believe Chinese people, with a restaurant of this magnitude they still have the same shitty Chinese mentally that people would just put hair in the food.  They should know the people who come here spend min $500for a group, people with this kind of money to spend eating out plus they also spend a large amount on tip just don't put hair in the food Maybe because we were laughing the whole time while our friend was talking to him so he thinks it's nothing, but we were laughing cause we knew they weren't going to do anything.   Don't they wear hair nets? We just know not to come back.  I hope you well when you go there, and your food is clean. The food is decent but we spend over $600 and for this kind of money We can have great Chinese food for less and with more varieties of food. This place is limited when it comes to that.  Also I feel they are not honest when it comes to weighing the lobster. The waitress first came out to tell us our lobster was over 6lbs and then at the end of the conversation she sayid it's over 7lbs and she did the same thing when we ordered the 2nd lobster. I have had Chinese lobsters for the past 30 year and I know for a fact that when our lobsters came out. They weren't over 12lbs.  If you taken all the cheap fish out of it. There isn't much meet there.  I am so disappointed with this place. If you want to eat lobsters you can just go to other Chinese restaurant and get your money worth."}
{"text":"Everything went wrong for our dinner at this place on Saturday.  First of all, reservation system was not properly enforced.  We made a reservation in advance and arrived 20 minutes prior, people who had reservation after us got seated first because they showed up earlier?  Secondly, poor service - particularly the one who was mostly bringing food to our table.  The entire restaurant was overly crowded and those chairs were huge that took up a lot of space.  We were told by the server that to move closer together while there was no space to do so.  It's also kinda silly that food were contained in huge plates that the lazy susan would easily filled up with 4 to 5 plates.  The server constantly came and rearranged the plates and tried to switch them into smaller ones for space while we were all trying to eat.  The server also spinned the lazy susan without being cautions of what's around.  My sister-in-law got spilled on 3 times because the wine glass fell down while the server spinned the lazy susan and knocked down the glass.    Thirdly, the taste of food was just average.  Not too bad but nothing wow.  I would say for the price we paid, it's not really worth it.    Another concern I have is the safety of this place.  As mentioned by a few people, this place is overly crowded and I am sure the people in the restaurant on Saturday night exceed way over the maximum capacity as guided by the city.  You could barely move around your chair because most chairs are back to back.  It's not a friendly place for people with mobile difficulty, or even elderly.  Again due to the overly crowded environment, it's not easy to enjoy the meal or the company of family and friends (it's too loud and I had to yell at the person next to me so he could hear me).  I will avoid this place if possible."}
{"text":"For all those who are wondering where the phrase mountain of lobster comes from... look no further this is the place to be!  Resturant specializing in mainly seafood ranging from lobsters, Vancouver crab, king crab,fish and etc... they have set menus that are catered to your specific party size. The ones we tend to go for are the Alaskan crab and lobster. Staff here seem to be super rushed each time we go.. I think it's because there are different group reservation time (ie. Every 3 hours). Before cooking they will bring the seafood item out for you to look at and take pictures then they bring it back in to cook (you don't actually know if what you see is what you eat though haha)   Quite tasty but every time we go there is left over. I do find the Alaskan crab very sweet and definitely a must get here. The mountain of lobster is also so picture worthy and delish.   Been here many times and never really a disappointment... (except you get super thirsty from all the sodium after!!!)"}
{"text":"I went to a friend's birthday for the first time and I can honestly say nothing short of perfection. Food, service, and atmosphere! Make sure you go there as a group because portions are humongous. Wether it's lobsters you're craving or you're in the mood for king crab, they've got it all."}
{"text":"What a fun meal!  We had a party of five and ordered the King Crab and Lobster meal which included lobster two-ways, crab legs, crab fried rice, green veggies and house soup.  I heard rumours of the \"lobster mountain\" before I went to this restaurant but when I actually saw it in person, I was still amazed!   It's quite a lot of food...too much I'd say, and since fried stuff doesn't keep well, taking it home is not worth it. It's also expensive and I would only go for a special event."}
{"text":"Wanted to take my parents here for the anniversary...i found 3 different phone numbers for them and called each one.   The line was either busy or no voicemail/answering service available so I couldn't make any type of reservation (we live about 40 minites away and I have this amazing gift of showing up to restaurants when they are closed for renovations or their days off or they are shut down permanently so I wasn't going to take any chances of screwing this up).  But after about 4 hours of calling all 3 numbers and no answer, we just gave up.  I've been here before and it is excellent, but you can't run a business if you can't even pick up the phone or have voicemail or online reservations.   We just went to a sushi restaurant instead."}
{"text":"Going to make this review short and sweet. I had the lunch special, which cost $89.99 if I remember correctly.  Service was exceptional! Very courteous and just impeccable. Food was absolutely jaw dropping.. The lobster was so fresh, I think I can pass on Red Lobster.. For price and freshness. Of course they're two different styles of cooking/prep and I'm not choosing this just because this is chinese. The food was just.. spectacular.   Good + good company + good service = A++"}
{"text":"The Fishman Lobster Clubhouse is a restaurant for seafood lovers. This restaurant has developed a cult following among food bloggers. The restaurant is flanked by tanks filled with king crab, lobster and fish. The service is best described as efficient. The atmosphere was quite lively while we were there. We would recommend a reservation if you go.  We got the lobster combo for two people. The combo came with soup of the day, lobster, poached snow pea with goji berry, lobster roe fried rice and dessert.  While the combo was expensive, we thought the price was worth it because the food was high quality and the portions were generous.  After ordering the combo, the waiter walked the live lobster to your table for your inspection. The pageantry was well rehearsed. The famous lobster mountain was delicious. It was an explosion of delicious flavours - a cereal of fried garlic garnishes, cantonese-style. The meat was sweet and buttery, salty and tender. This meal could have fed four people. We had a lot of leftovers.   We can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this lobster restaurant that everyone has been raving about and it was totally worth the wait! A bunch of friends came here on a saturday night last week and it was packed! Good thing we made reservations because the entire restaurant was filled. The service was pretty top notch for an asian restaurant as we arrived about 30 mins late and they were nice enough to hold our table. The service was prompt and efficient. Even the manager came over to our table a few times to check how everything was on this busy night.  The ambience of the restaurant was pretty fancy and had nice decor. It was surrounded by tanks of lobster, crab and fish.  Now let's get to the best part...the food was so delicious that my party of 6 devoured everything in 30-40 minutes. We ordered a 10lbs lobster combo that came with steamed bass, fried oysters, veggies, soup and even a bottle of wine. We also ordered a side order of fried rice which was absolutely delicious. The fried lobster was juicy and full of flavour offering a generous amount for the size we ordered. Don't count your calories for this meal as mostly everything was deep fried but totally worth it!  Definitely coming back again to try their king crab and other types of fish."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where I've been hiding all that time but jeez this place is AMAZINGLY GOOD."}
{"text":"Okay first off the food here was delicious. I came here with my friend and my husband over the weekend. Heard about their king crab and lobster. We ordered the king crab and lobster combo. The king crab came out to be 5lbs and the lobster Came out to be 7.68lbs. The lobster was fried with the garlic and peppers arranged in a tower format! Let me tell you the lobster was so flavorful,fresh and so tender we devoured the entire dish.  The Crab we had it cooked a few different ways. Crab legs fried with garlic bits (delicious!!!!), crab legs steamed with salted egg and the yolk!, crab fried rice with the shell on top. On top of that corn egg drop soup, and veggies sautéed in garlic.  And of course the dessert soup. There were a couple of other dishes but I can remember right now.  By the end I was soooo stuffed. Needed to walk around a bit!   Service was great when we were there. They came and checked in on us and was constantly changing our plates to ensure we had space.   I took a star off Bc making a rsvp via telephone was next to impossible. The line was constantly busy and  we were unable to get through. We ended up driving over there to make a rsvp which ended up being their last time slot.   But this is a place I def recommend coming with a group if you like seafood. Best seafood meal I had in a while!!"}
{"text":"While exploring Toronto and other places nearby, I came here with a group of 5 for the 15lb lobster dish that my friend said this place is famous for. We definitely ordered way too much food since we ordered 2 other dishes on top of what the combo came with... they showed us the 3 big, fresh lobsters that would be prepared in our dish. Of course we had to take a picture holding the lobsters first lol. It's one thing when you see the dish on other tables around you. It's another thing when they put it on your table in front of your face. We asked a waiter to help us take group pics with the lobster dish. He was an amusing guy who took some good pics for us. Definitely worth having at least once."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm super happy my family and I came here to celebrate my mom's birthday. Seriously, make sure you make reservations because tables fill up fast! We came here last Sunday evening at 6pm and half an hour in, the place was full.  There were a lot of sets to choose from the menu and it tells you for how many people. I had wanted to order us the Crab & Lobster set but after looking carefully, it seemed like a lotttt of food for 4 people and we can't eat that much. So in the end, we ordered the Lobster set - HK style which came with daily soup, vegetables, bass fish and dessert. But we also ordered a plate of lobster roe fried rice on the side. Our lobster like every lobster dish here is piled like a mountain! Instagram worthy for sure! Even though it was a 5lb lobster, it was a lot for the four of us. And I really enjoyed the little fried fishies, they go well with rice ;). Also, loved the lobster roe fried rice. We couldn't even finish the fried rice because we were too busy eating the lobster and the other food that we had to pack it up to go.   Overall, we had good service, and it's a great place for special occasions because it is really expensive. So I do recommend going in big groups!"}
{"text":"Awesome display in the restaurant all over the walls. Lots of choices and takes big groups easily. Flavours were great!"}
{"text":"Best lobster and king crab I ever had!!! Enough said!!!!  Planning another trip there on the way to Montreal"}
{"text":"It's definitely a must try if you love lobster, but I must say after trying the lobster tower I don't want to have lobster again for a good while. I came with 7 friends and we got the 25lb lobster mountain. It was truly a sight...it was HUGE. I guess for $64 a person, it was quite an experience. The taste was pretty good but quickly got tired of it after having 3-4 of it. It's quite oily and you will feel it afterwards. However, their other dishes are also quite good. Soup was hot and flavorful, the veggies were also great. The fried rice portion was a bit skimpy but it also tasted very flavorful. I also enjoyed the dessert which was a cashew Chinese porridge."}
{"text":"New location, much more spacious and comfortable. The ambiance feels like a bar/higher end restaurant mixed with Chinese restaurant decorations.  The lobster is good as always with photo opportunities. We ordered a combo that comes with Masi, the soup is beautifully done. Service was okay, there are the odd waiter that are better than others. Love this location, will definitely be back more more lobster mountain!  Note: cash only"}
{"text":"My party of 12 were able to be seated without a reservation which is a huge plus. To me, this place actually earned a solid 5 Star because of their impeccable service and food. From the time we walked in without a reservation they've accommodated to every thing we asked, although they did rushed us to order, it was understandable due to our circumstance.  So enough of the service and onto the food, we ordered the feast that fed 10-12 people which was about $698 and every dish was remarkable. By the way, the flavor we asked for was dry garlic on both crab and lobster! I always preferred eating lobster over crab due to its simplicity to eat, but this place made it so easy for me to eat the crab! It's precut for the customers so we can use a finger and scoop the meat out of the crab's legs! Furthermore, this place was so good that everyone sitting at the table was quiet and stuffing their face .   Beside the crabs and lobster, I really enjoyed their fried oysters they gave us, had a semi salty egg flavor to it.   When I come visit Toronto from California again, I'm definitely going to stop by this place again!"}
{"text":"You can't find this in America.  You win cooked lobster battle canada!    If you're visiting, yes this is with the 40 to hour drive.   This is the best dang lobster I've ever had.   I don't say that often.     You also get to take pictures with your lobster too.  It is pricey though but worth it"}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times and each time I am always pleased by the food. An upfront disclaimer is that you don't come here for the service/decor/ambiance. You're here for the food, so keep that in mind. Tables can be rather squishy, and make sure to ALWAYS make a reservation ahead of time. Good luck finding a table otherwise.   I'm a huge fan of the famous lobster. Few times I've had greater than 10lbs portion of lobster for a party of 6-8. Yummy food, deeply satisfying, definite visit for seafood lovers."}
{"text":"Seafood Seafood Seafood. I've been here for both dinner and lunch. They cook their giant crustaceans many different ways.  For dinner you can go for a multi course meal which enables you to try all the different seafood they have at a premium price ($$$$). I prefer going at lunch for a set menu of just the lobster specialties as I feel like I get the best bang for my buck and it's significantly cheaper. That being said, all the dishes taste delicious including the crab legs.  They can also cook up standard fare from regular chinese restaurants but obviously they specialize in seafood.  So if you have a special night planned or if it's your first time going, I suggest you try everything!"}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern prior to our trip to Markham with my fiance and his family. My fiance and I had dinner with my cousin who lives in Toronto on our last night. We came around 6:30-7PM and surprisingly we didn't have to wait for a table. We got seated right away in the middle of where other families and friends came to have an all out seafood galore for dinner!  The restaurant was massive and surrounded with panoramic views of the tanks filled with different crustaceans and fishes. It's almost like an aquarium. My fiance, cousin and I actually ordered a set meal for four people since we felt excited to try the different dishes and daring to eat the feast! Prior to killing the lobsters (sorry that we ate you), a staff member will haul the container of lobsters to your table for you to take a look and an opportunity to touch and hold the lobsters with your bare hands also known as a photo opportunity. I was a little scared to hold the lobsters, but my fiance and cousin didn't hesitate to hold them.   So our feast for us started with:   Double Boiled Black Chicken with Herbs - I don't seem to recall ever having this soup, but it was amazing! I usually don't like soups with herbs, but this was exceptionally good! The soup felt very homey and comfort food. We had extra soup leftover so my fiance and I actually brought it back to the hotel we were staying at with his family. This was probably one of the best restaurant soups I've had so far. It didn't feel oily and didn't have that strong herb taste, everything about it was just perfection!  Lobster Mountain - I feel like this dish is a big reason why a lot of people come here besides for the love of lobster. This is a mountain of fried lobster claws, fried garlic, fried anchovies, and shredded lettuce for garnishment .I've seen giant mountains of these fried lobsters at other and bigger tables and boy it was truly a mountain! So heavy and massive that it required two people to carry the dish carefully to the big tables. Ours wasn't heavy at all. I was impressed by the flavors and aromatics from the lobster mountain. It was seasoned just right and had the lobster meat was well-cooked. I especially liked the fried anchovies, so crunchy and good!  Steamed Bass - The servers didn't help us separate the fish from the bones so we had to do it ourselves. The fish was the perfect size for us three and we finished it quick. The fish was delicious and the pieces of meat were light, delicate, and just melts in your mouth.   Lobster Roe Fried Rice - I'm glad some fried rice was accompanied with our feast because without it, it would be like something is missing.The lobster roe fried rice was okay, not the best fried rice I've had. It was good and nice to have it paired with the other dishes we were served.   Snow Pea Tips with GojI Berries - This is probably one of my favorite Chinese vegetables. I really liked this dish because it tasted very homey too and delicious. The snow pea tips were perfectly blanched and really paired well with our lobster feast!  Lobster HK Style - The next lobster dish was just a simple, sauteed lobster HK style with ginger and scallions. It's similar to the traditional lobster dish we would get at any Chinese restaurant. I wasn't very amused by this dish because it was so identical to what we can get in New York. The flavors, texture, and appearance is the same to what we have in New York.  Steamed lobster with scallions and melted butter - When I saw this dish I was amazed because I've never really seen this type of lobster dish in New York or anywhere really. It's steamed lobster garnished with scallions and melted butter to dip. I mean I've seen dishes like this in American cuisine and at seafood restaurants, but NEVER in an Asian restaurant so it was very interesting. It turned out that I fell in love with this dish, nothing like pulling a tender piece of lobster and dipping into a yellow bowl of buttery goodness! I can't stop thinking about this dish at all.  Dessert - Black Sesame Pudding - I love black sesame especially in a pudding or dessert form. I like that roasty flavor from the black sesames! It was a great ending to our lobster feast!  Overall, service was on point. The real star of the restaurant though is the food! I highly recommend checking out Fishman when you're in Markham, definitely a true gem. I am looking forward to my next trip to Markham/Toronto so I can come back to Fishman and hopefully with a bigger group. It was my fiance's dream to come here during our trip and I'm glad I helped made his dream come true. We had a lot of food left over that we split it with my cousin and brought some back to our hotel room and made it into a midnight snack for my fiance, his mom, and I."}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time and as all other reviews, the lobster and crab are impressive. Came with a group of 7 people and ordered a 25 lb lobster mountain... And it was glorious   Definitely, would recommend, but get ready to eat. I would get a bowl of plain rice to offset the taste of the salty fried lobster and definitely get a vegetable dish.   Overall, great lobster - price is sort of expensive but it's worth it given how expensive seafood normally is. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin?   1. Service: OUTSTANDING. They are always on the look to see if you require any assistance, want to hear your feedback, or simply just make sure you're having a great time at the restaurant.  2. Location: Easy to find, especially if you're from Scarborough. It's right in the middle of Kennedy and Midland along finch, you REALLY can't miss it.   3. Ordering process: Not a typical seafood restaurant, so many options, and high quality selections. ** if you're with a large group of people (8-12) I definitely recommend getting one of the Lobster Mountains - as seen in the photo.** The servers were kind enough to give us their input and what they suggested.  4. The actual food: After we ordered our food, they had brought the live lobsters to the table and allowed us to take pictures with it. A little frightening seeing such large lobsters thrown in our faces but definitely an experience. Once the food arrived, I must say it was very flavourful and I was very happy with our choice.  I didn't have ANYTHING bad to say about this place and would definitely come again with another large party."}
{"text":"Pros: - Black chicken lean pork soup was very tasty - Vancouver crab plate was massive! We got lobster at an additional cost. Must try.  - Flounder was good - Restaurant was noisy, but clean. You're surrounded by gigantic lobsters in tanks. Kinda feel bad for them - Service was quick  - Definitely worth the price and trip  Cons: - Get there early or make reservations cause it can get packed!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I saw a video of the lobster mountains in this restaurant on Eater and have been obsessed with trying the place ever since. We came with a group of friends to Toronto recently and this was the first place on our itinerary. I've heeded other Yelpers' advice and made a reservation in advance.  I am glad I did because the place was completely packed when we arrived at our appointed time.   The interior is relatively big, but packed with tables, customers and servers. We poured over the stack of menus laid out in front of us with a dizzying amount of options, and decided to go with the simplest option, i.e. 25lb of lobster Mountain done in two styles, Hong Kong Style and in Maggi sauce. One of our friends do not eat seafood, so we ordered a few other dishes for him, including beef tenderloin, sweet and sour pork and lobster roe fried rice.   After we placed the order, the servers brought over a cooler with two huge lobsters that will soon be our dinner.  I've never seen lobsters that big before, and we took turn posing with them (kind of sad if you think about it). One thing of note is that if the two lobsters go over 25lbs, they charge you an overage fee of $17/lb.  Given the fact that we are already paying nearly $400 for the lobsters, the overage fee didn't seem like a huge deal.   Our meal came with a bottle of white wine and soup. The soup was well liked by the group, it was a Chinese black chicken herbal soup and seemed like a good way to ease you into the mountain of lobsters.  Of course the lobsters were the stars of the show, because we divided our order into two styles, our \"mountain\" didn't look as impressive as the others. The restaurant provided disposable gloves on each table, which was extremely handy as we feasted. The consensus around the table was that the Maggi style was our favorite due to the stronger flavor the soy sauce provided.   A couple of quick notes on the other dishes, we really liked the snow pea tips, which they agreed to make with just garlic instead of goji berries.  The group also loved the beef tenderloin and sweet & sour pork.  However, the lobster roe fried rice seemed to be overpriced for what it is, i.e. a fairly plain fried rice.  The dessert of almond tofu pudding was a nice surprise and a great way to cap off the amazing meal.   Overall, an expensive, but unique and fantastic experience. The servers were hurried, but attentive. Totally worth the visit if you are a seafood lover!"}
{"text":"Finally, I had the chance to dine at Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant. After hearing many great things about this restaurant, it was about time that I had a chance to have some good seafood dishes.   The dishes are bold in taste. The presentation of the dishes is very phenomenal as they creating exciting and tasteful creations.   In terms of the service, it can vary, depending on different customers' experiences. The owner's wife and waiters may try to upsell you on ordering larger quantities on lobster or crab. For example, you may think you are ordering a 4 lbs. lobster, but actually they bring out a 5.5 lbs. lobster where they can charge you more. A family friend actually suggests if you want a specific size lobster, try to order in smaller quantity so you get what you want. For example, if you want a 4 lbs. lobster, order a 2.5 lbs. lobster so you don't get tricked when you receive the bill.   Overall, if you love seafood, then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Horrible service and make sure you bring cash! I'm from the U.S. and I've never been to a restaurant that serves $500 plates, but doesn't accept credit cards or U.S. debit cards.   Presentation is awesome, food is decent."}
{"text":"If you want to stuff your face with amazing seafood, this is the place to be.  There is a ton of options here including set dinners which make it easier to choose what to eat. One thing the menu does a poor job of is estimating the number of people to finish a set meal. For example, the set meals for 11-12 people provides a lot more food than 10-12 people can finish. It is more appropriate for 14-15 people.  The most popular dish here by far is the Large Lobster dishes which are filled with meat. Both the Hong Kong Style and Dry Garlic style are both delicious, and you can't go wrong with either option, though I prefer the HK style. King Crab is quite good as well, as it is very juicy. As for the oysters, eels, clams and steamed fish, these are all quite ordinary in taste for a Chinese restaurant. Fried rice with Lobster is a bit different from the typical fried rice dishes but can be a bit heavy especially with the lobster matter.  Overall, this is a great place for lobster and king crab. Be prepared for a long wait if you don't make reservations as this place is always fully booked.  Food: 9/10 Service: 7/10 Atmosphere: 7/10"}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of the best tasting seafood restaurants in terms of freshness and infused flavours.  Presentation of each dish was simple but presentable and colourful.   Seafood is the freshest in all of Toronto.  The lobsters and crabs are served from the tank alive to your table.  You will never taste rubbery tasting seafood here.  The only reason why I did not give this restaurant a 5 star is due to the excessive oil they add in the wok fried seafood dishes.  Limit the oil a little bit and you'll be spot in, this way the meat strands of the seafood flesh will not be as repellant to the spices when wok frying.  All in all I still highly recommend as it is the only restaurant in all the gta with the freshness and infused flavours."}
{"text":"This is the ultimate seafood banquet destination in Toronto. They used to be in Markham but has moved to this location. The decor is kinda overpowered by the rows of lobster tanks on the wall. Honestly I find it a bit eerie to eat while being surrounded by them. While this is not my preferred atmosphere, I come from time to time when invited.  I like this new location in that the parking seems to be dedicated to this venue only.  Decor aside, the food is wonderfully prepared. I think this place is so popular, that on this particular visit they ran out of king crabs to serve. Therefore the seafood is always fresh here. They have many ways of seasoning and preparing the lobsters and they were all so tasty. The lobster mountain is a sight to behold.   The service is not as attentive, because they are so busy, but they do try to replace the plates frequently when they get full of shells. It's also kinda annoying that they only take debit and cash, not credit cards."}
{"text":"If you like shellfish, look no further. This place is the ultimate location for lobsters and crabs. The prices are great and the portions are enormous. We got the Lobster dinner for 2 which gave us 6.8 pounds of lobster. We could not finish it but it was absolutely delicious. Will for sure come again, the bigger the group the better.    PS: Debit/Cash only."}
{"text":"This place was pretty busy for a weekday evening. It looks pretty fancy, more upscale with large aquariums to display all the fish, lobsters and crabs. Most people working there were Chinese speaking.   The food was a lot, more than the recommended portion. The meal for two could feed 3 or 4 people. We ordered lobster combo in HK style - 5 items. It worked out to be $98 plus add-ons, tax and tip. There's a mandatory 10% tip. They provide plastic gloves since it's oily and messy. The lobster was deep fried, it'll give you the farts :)   The quality was good, but the food is pretty expensive. They show you the lobster before they cook it. Presentation is fancy. They don't accept credit cards; only debit or cash. Overall, I'd save this place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Came here with my family to enjoy a feast of lobster as this is one of the better places for this kind of meal in Scarborough/Markham area. This place is packed! As they don't take any walk-ins, especially for a group of 14. This is a new location for them, and it is much bigger than their previous location. Which allows for a higher volume of tables, hence people to come and feast.   Onto the venue itself: once you step inside, you will see a fish tanks filled with all sorts of live lobsters, eels, crabs and etc. This is their trademark. However, I did find the decor a bit... dark? But that is just my observation. Even though our group went there for lunch, and there were lots of people. The air ventilation was good, so that's not bad at all.  Onto the food, so we didn't order the mountain full of deep fried lobster, which comes from ONE huge lobster. Instead we ordered many smaller and have more variety of dishes. Dishes such as lobster claws steamed with in sauce on a bed of vermicelli, lobster stir fried with noodles, and steamed lobster legs. These tasted pretty good actually, even for a non-lobster eating person such as myself.   The service staff are pretty good too, yes I was surprised. Cause going to Asian places, I always have this misconception of bad attitude and often rushing the patrons out for the next batch of people. This place maintained a professional attitude and staff that will talk to patrons like normal people.   Will come back for another big occasion."}
{"text":"Gigantic lobsters and crabs galore. I loved the experience watching the fresh uncooked seafood brought out before your eyes and then the final delicious flavourful cooked version. Plates of seafood bigger than your face.  Only downside is how popular they are. Reservations are a must, even if it isnt a Fri/Sat night. Or else expect to be turned away or a long wait.  Service is good. Food is flavourful. If you like shellfish, try this."}
{"text":"This place is completely overrated and people don't come here for the food quality but rather to take souvenir pictures of the the lobster and crab. We ordered the salty-egg yolk lobster 3 person combo. The menu says 5lb but they push you to upsize and charge you more. When the food came the lobster was bland and dry. After completing most of our meal we realized they had forgotten to serve the fish. When we notified them that if it wasn't already cooked we would rather not have it they insisted that we needed to pay for it as it was part of the set menu price. At that point, we were full and having to wait an extra 20 mins to take home unwanted fish that would just get cold sounded ridiculous. Eventually after having to put up a bit of a dispute he took it off the bill but charged a 10% tip without our consent. Ultimately the experience was not worth the money and our party was extremely disappointed and unsatisfied with the lack of honesty from the service."}
{"text":"Very good for experience! If you love seafood, you should definitely check this place out! I still think everyone who goes should be prepared to pay for a bit of a pricey meal. If you go with more people and a bigger party the better experience because you do have bigger portions of seafood and you get full. I went with a couple of people who don't normally enjoy seafood but they enjoyed the experience and meal.   If you care for it, you can take a picture of the lobster or crab you're about to eat and have cooked for your table. Of course many people are attracted to the tower of food, so it is good and filling.   I would only go for a special occasion/celebration!"}
{"text":"Can't believe it took me this long to try this place but I'm happy to say it lived up to my expectations.   We ordered the $88 dinner set for 2 which comes with a black chicken soup, 5lbs of steamed lobster, snow pea tips with goji berries, lobster roe fried rice, and black sesame dessert. We \"upgraded\" the steamed lobster to HK style which I believe is an extra $15 or so but that's their signature so if you don't come here for that, you're missing out on the best part. Shortly after you order, they will bring out a fresh lobster/crab for you to see/take a picture with and inform you about the weight. It's usually slightly more and you'd pay the difference but ours was pretty close (5.26lbs).  Everything was great. The lobster tower never fails to turn heads and it tastes as good as it looks. Perfectly fried and the generous amount of mini anchovies on the plate are so addicting. They really taste good with just about anything. The other dishes were well-made, further enhancing the meal. No complaints at all. I was so full by the time dessert came but I'm glad I tried it anyway because the black sesame was delicious! Not too sweet and just right. Can't wait to try the crab next time.  We also ordered fried oysters on the side and they were AMAZING. Good size and the honey & black pepper sauce is like no other. Have it with the lobster roe fried rice and you're golden!  Portions are huge and even though the combos/sets claim to feed a certain number of people, you'll have a TON of leftovers to take back in which a server will pack up nicely for you.   The restaurant is outlined by large fish tanks full of lobsters and crabs which is nice to look at as you eat. However, one thing that really stood out to me about Fishman was the service. I never have high expectations when it comes to Chinese establishments but I was surprised how efficient, attentive and KIND everyone was. Tip is automatically included in your bill (10%) so it wasn't like they were being friendly in hopes of getting tipped. Seemed more like a standard that they've set for themselves considering they're one of the most popular and high end Chinese restaurants around. Highly impressed.   All in all, great experience. The place is catered more towards families and big groups so it's perfect for a celebration!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out after hearing good things from friends and reviews on Yelp.   We went there on a Monday night around 7:30pm and was seated in the outside part of the restaurant, after asking to be seated inside, we were advised that that portion was for people who reserved.   We ordered the 4lb lobster that was spicy that came with the deep fried fishes. The waitress came back to with a lobster in a bucket saying that 5lb was all she could find. I kind of expected that since I had read about that happening and my friend's parents had a similar experience so we simply asked to her find one that was closer to 4lbs as the 5lb looked rather large for 2 people.   She came back with one that weighed 4.89lbs .. we were hungry so we accepted.   The cooked lobster arrived at our table 10mins later and it was a mountain of lobster! it was just as delicious as everyone had described. After eating as much as we could, we stuffed 2 take out containers that could barely close.   In conclusion, good service, good food, good enough for me. I will definitely go back to try the other seafood and with more people next time."}
{"text":"New location is a lot bigger compared to the Silver Star location and seating is not cramped like the previous one.  Food is still as great as the previous location.  Definitely not a cheap meal but worth going to when you see the mountains of lobster going to each table."}
{"text":"Sometimes the schtick is enough, and sometimes it isn't.  The claim to fame here, obviously, are the ginormous portions of fresh lobster and crab.  The experience they've got down pat, once you order, they cart out the doomed sea creatures they will momentarily chop up and cook for you so you can meet them before they die (?), or maybe so you can take a lame-ish selfie (okay, all selfies are lame).  Then, they neatly stack mountains and towers out of the legs and body parts of these unfortunates, dress them up with deep-fried bits (garlic and/or tiny fish) and let you go to town.  My problems were the following:  1.  A bit overpriced for what it is, but what really got my goat was that the menus are so overwhelming that they recommended something for $320 for 3-4 people, and what showed up was an amount of food that could easily have filled up a table of 10 (and believe me, the three of us are no slouches when it comes to eating our share of a large spread). 2.  On top of the over-the-top recommendation, they weigh the specimens before they are presented to you and tell you, it'll be $30 more because this one is .7 lbs bigger than the xxx lbs we include in the deal.  So you're left to decide on the spot whether that's acceptable to you, or if you want them to exchange for a potentially smaller creature.  Just be forewarned. 3.  Presentation gets top marks, but the actual flavour intensity was lacking (not sure how this is possible when everything is covered in fried garlic, but it is).  Maybe it's because of all the garlic or the fact that everything is deep-fried, but something drowns out the natural sweetness of the crab and lobster.  I did enjoy things, but it wasn't good enough for a return visit - for that amount of money, one can do much better.  Good for a single 'glad I tried it' visit."}
{"text":"The best seafood so far I ate. Plus super cool that they builded all the seafood tanks all over the restaurant wall Prepare for long wait if no reservation  Highly recommend this restaurant and must try if you are in Markham"}
{"text":"My first time here...this is the best lobster what I had in Canada!!!we order the combo for four 128$...we got the 5lbs lobster in hong Kong style....like the mountain...it's huge!!!so good!!and the service is fast!"}
{"text":"This is not my first time going to this restaurant, so this rating does reflect both times, which is that i was not amazed or surprised by it. It is a restaurant that focuses on 2 things which is the lobster tower, and the king crab. I have to say that it is not very amazing at both, it does have points for presentation value, because it does do that very well. But given the price point, and the quality of seafood, i have to say that only the Lobster is pretty good, the king crab definitely, leaves a lot to be desired.  the other dishes it serves are not done very well for the most parts. we had snow peas with dates. which turned out to be bitter, we also had the black chicken soup, which was not done very well. on top of that was a sweet and sour pork that was okay. The black pepper beef, was absolutely terrible. i've rarely had one that bad, it was overly salted, and too heavy black pepper spice.   The deep fried oyster with salty egg yolk was not bad, but not great. it was definitely something different that not a lot of places does.   Overall the experience at the restaurant was that, it was not amazing, but neither is it bad. I would say if you haven't tried it. you could go and try, but i wouldn't go out of my way to do so. as the price is fairly expensive, and you may or may not find it worth it in the end."}
{"text":"I will never come to this restaurant again! Five of us came and order a crab and lobster combo $489. Before they cook it they put it on our table to show us what we are getting. The food taste so so average. The place wasn't big and it was crowded even with 5 people. When we were done the problem begin! The combo was suppose to be $489.00 plus tax. It turn out $625 instead. The owner of the restaurant told us that the crab was a 1 and a half pound more so they have to charge us more. We said the combo was suppose to be a fix price why didn't you tell us that before hand? At the end we have it to pay them and told them we won't come back again. This also happen to our friend later and they told us about it. I want everyone to know about this because we should not get rip off !!!"}
{"text":"Nice busy restaurant specializing in lobster and crab.  Decor is cool with the walls of tanks of fresh seafood.  They bring the live lobster and crab to your table for photos - weird but cool.  Food was really delicious and we'll presented.  Fried crabs legs with fried garlic was my favorite dish.  Also had the sweet and sour pork which was really Crispy and noodles (plain looking but tasty).  Service was good and staff spoke fluent English.  Not cheap but really nice for a special occasion.  Debit and cash only!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday and got the huge lobster tower thing that everyone gets. It was definitely very yummy but I feel like their set menus aren't really that great because it only came with a nasty vegetable dish (way too much oil and MSG) and a cheap bottle of wine for like $500 something? Also they only accept cash lol (typical Asian places). The restaurant also feels quite dirty and they definitely tried to pack as many tables and chairs in there as possible. It's definitely a good place for photo ops and the lobster is delicious but it does get boring after your 20th piece. Good to try once for an experience but probably wouldn't do it a second time."}
{"text":"This is a cash only lobster and crab feast.  They do accept debit cards but only from Canadian banks, so if your from the US bring cash.  They sell the crab and lobster by the weight of the animal and the smallest crabs here are 5 pounds.  With four people you can easily expect to pay $300 to $400 for dinner.   We decided to go with the crab lobster combo for $298.  Because both the crab and lobster were a little bigger the total bill ended up being $425 when you include the extra weight, gratuity which is automatically included and the Canadian taxes.  Before they cook you meal they bring the animal alive you are about to eat.  The lobster was cooked Hong Kong style with a portion of the lobster being steamed with egg white and butter and the other part of the lobster was fried Hong Kong style served with fried vermicelli and fried baby anchovies.  The king crab was fried in their special fried garlic batter.  Both were absolutely mouthwatering good, we had enough for two seafood feasts.  The meal comes with lobster fried rice, a vegetable, and corn soup, but honestly if they would have forgot these three items, I would not have cared.  You come here for the decadent seafood, I am not sure how this place keeps packing people in at these prices but they were packed on a Wednesday afternoon."}
{"text":"The awards that Lobster Clubhouse would win in my books:  + Pricest Chinese restaurant in Scarberia (Easy spend of $50/person, and that's being conservative) + Most impressive presentation of lobster. If you like lobster, why wouldn't you love it an overflowing colossal tower. Geniuses.  + Fastest plate changing service (To the point where I literally had to eat faster and/or make a bigger mess on my plate so it could be worth their while to give me the new clean one) + Best fried rice, the one with lobster roe. Get this dish. It's delicious and salty and good and a bargain at $8.99  To conclude, a great place to go if you're feeling generous- both in terms of letting that thing you love flow out of your wallet and that thing you love flow into your stomach."}
{"text":"Always fully booked on weekend for lunch. My father booked a table for my family for  celebration. We called for a party of  11, upon arriving we found out they wrote down for 6 people. (Very unlikely mistakenable numbers) Regardless of who's right or who's wrong. They weren't able to seat us, weren't apologetic and didn't offer any option. Basically just repeated that they didnt make any mistake the whole time.  My father told them that they repeated the booking several times confirming 11 ppl but they wrote down 6... so now is a he said she said situation.  We had to take our party of 3 families with children else where..   If you book this place.. you better triple or quadruple confirm the seating cos they might put down the wrong number and blame the customer for it."}
{"text":"This is probably my second favourite seafood restaurant. The service was so down to earth and the waiters were patient enough to explain the selection in great detail. $250 later my girlfriend and I left the restaurant happy as a lark."}
{"text":"3 stars go to the food only.   Clearly this restaurant isn't organized in terms of service. We couldn't even order without the waiter telling us to wait and walking off accommodating bigger parties(shout-out to Bruce). When we tried to ask him about the dinner sets, he got irritated and started shouting. And as if that wasn't bad enough, we waited over an hour for the food. During our wait, I saw a few employees bickering with each other and we constantly were ignored when asked about our food. I don't see how they can service this restaurant if they can't get their shit together as a team. I've seen better service at McDonald's."}
{"text":"Come in a big group and enjoy the seafood feast! Service and quality has been spectacular. Especially the display of the lobster mountain!  They recently moved to a bigger and better place with lots of parking. So no need to fight over parking spots when you're hangry."}
{"text":"Some of the best lobster I have ever had. I would say this place is more suited for larger groups. So you can choose a huge lobster and other delicious seafoods that can be cooked in different ways. I think the chef here really knows his seafood and how to cook it well.   The soup and complimentary sesame dessert is very good.  The fish and veggie dishes are cooked very nice and not too salty with great flavour.  The lobsters are huge and full of meat and flavour.  I bring friends, family and even people who are on vacation to come here. Indeed it is pricey tho, not something you have every week. But for what you get, it's worth the price.  I brought my cousin from the west coast here (there is a lot of seafood where he is from) and he really enjoyed the many ways the lobster is cooked."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience here with my family on our trip to Toronto. You know that group that comes in with no reservations but insists that they HAVE to make room for us? Yep. That was us.   The staff was so accommodating! They wedged us in at 9:30pm (we really really wanted to eat here) and even gave us a complimentary bottle of wine...even though we probably made their heads spin!  The food was so awesome! Please only eat seafood while you're here. Giant lobsters and crabs in tanks all around the restaurant...perfectly steamed sea bass. Delicious fried lobster and crabs. My cholesterol really took a hit that night. #yolo"}
{"text":"Get the cash ready and empty your belly for this meal! I can't say that it's the best lobster meal I've had but it was one magnificent and memorable meal not to mention the fact that my picky parents said it was the best meal they've ever had - so that made me love it even more.  We got the family meal special where it comes with several dishes and a decent sized tower of king crab and lobster. I don't know how they do it, it was fried but not at all oily but instead it was juicy and flavorful and finger-lickin good! They know how to cook the seafood here and they do it very well, it's a bit cruel to bring out the lobsters and crabs for us to hold them live and then cook them...I am sorry but I ate everything."}
{"text":"The experience was well worth for this restaurant. If you got friends and family visiting, it is definitely worth the money.  However just a tip their set menus come with alot of food. We were 7 but ordered a set menu for 4 with left overs!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best seafood restaurants in Ontario that specializes in cooking king crab. We ordered the 4 persons package that consisted of: 1 soup of the day, 1 king crab that's slightly over 6 lbs done 3 ways, 2 lobsters that were around 3 lbs each, 1 stir fry green bean sprouts, 1 large plate of stir fry rice made from king crab and lobsters and hot dessert soups. They notified us before cooking that we would have to pay extra for  our king crab and lobsters because their weight were slightly over the package price, which we were ok with.   The soup and the first dish of steamed king crab with garlic and onion came very quickly within 15 to 20 min, which we were pleased with. Then the deep fried king crab and lobster came right afterwards. From steamed to deep fried, their king crab and lobsters were cooked to perfection. The meat was tender, juicy and of course, very fresh. The waiters also provided good service by clearing our table of crab and lobster shells twice, but I wish they can stop pretend not to see me waving at them when I tried to ask for napkins.  This meal was definitely expensive but we felt it was worth the price for the delicious and freshly cooked king crab and lobsters that you probably won't be able to find unless you go to Asia."}
{"text":"I would come here just for their lobster mountain and deep fried honey oysters. Very addicting.   They've also got lots of waiters which is nice cause you don't have to keep your hand up waiting to get someone's attention to serve you.   If you're not getting any seafood dishes, don't come here. Their sweet and sour pork is mediocre."}
{"text":"We ordered the large lobster dinner for six.  It came with soup (chicken broth), a lobster mountain, fried oyster with ginger and green onion, fried crab, steamed eel with orange peel, poached snow pea tips with wolf berry, steamed bass and dessert (black sesame). I thought the portions were really decent and was enough to fill a group of five with some left overs.The soup, poached snow tips and crab were pretty good. The highlight of the meal was definitively the lobster mountain and the oyster. I didn't like the eel. It wasn't particularly flavourful. Overall, I'd say it is best enjoyed in a larger group. It's a bit pricey for what it is but should be sufficient quantity.   You definitely need to make reservations beforehand. Parking might be difficult due to the Planet Fitness nearby. You just might have to park a bit further from the restaurant."}
{"text":"We had an awesome time.  Ordered a combo of Hong Kong style lobster, green onion crab and steamed sea bass.  Everything was fantastic. We'll be back for sure. Perfect for a larger group. Service was great, took pride in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be a little place located further up east steeles, my family and I have been going to this place for quite a while, the restaurant is always busy with a huge line up at the door and this is especially true during holidays and weekends. Their signature deep fried Cantonese style lobster and king crab dishes are absolutely delicious, it is one of the few restaurants in Toronto that serve lobsters and king crabs like this, if today is the last day I am going to live, these are the dishes that I am going to eat as my last meal. The food speaks for themselves, there was no advertisement needed, What urge me to write a review here is because the shady business practice they been having lately. Let me explain, the restaurant's menu comes with several sets of meal that bundle several dishes together, and depending on how many people you have, there will be a bundle that server just the right amount of dishes. Usually, when I go there either with my family or friends we like to order one of the meal set because it saves a lot the time and trouble. However, here comes the sketchy part which I have confirmed with several friends that went there lately. When we order a meal set with either lobster or king crab, the staff will bring the lobster to us to show us it is alive and confirm the weight of the lobster and king crab before they cook it. Lately, EVERY time they manage to bring lobster and crab that are heavier than what was stated on the menu, say you order a meal set that is $599 with 6 lbs. of crab and 7 lbs. of lobster, a moment later the staff will tell you they have picked out a 7 lbs. crab and 8 lbs. lobster, and try to upsell you, and if you ask to change for something smaller, their response is they ran out of the smaller ones and you have to settle. The lobster is cheap enough to let it slip under the radar but the king crab costs almost 50 dollars a pound, so by the end of your meal, the $599 meal set just became a $700 cash grab, + tax and tip you are looking at at least $860+ for your bill and guess what they only accept debit or cash, the meal set I described above is for 4 people, you are looking at $200+ per person, with that much money I can go anywhere in Toronto and get myself a fancy dinner. Before you say anything, I know that you absolutely can not pick out the exact weight for lobster and crab every time, given the circumstances there ought to difference in weight give or take, BUT lately it's always heavier never lighter. You can call it confirmation bias if you so think, but to me this is just shady business practice, schemes to upsell the customers. I even begin to think if the staff is getting paid more in commission for upselling us. Don't believe me? next time you go there observe closely at what they bring you. This restaurant used to be good and the food was something to die for, the people use to be hearty. Now I don't even know anymore... I hope the owner sees this and look back at the little restaurant that they used to run with their sweat and blood, and hopefully, the can reflect on themselves and just bring back the good old restaurants that many of us comes to love and enjoy."}
{"text":"Just look at that 25lbs lobster plate!! Nothing much more to say, it was delicious. The pieces were crispy and flavorful on the outside, and so tender on the inside. Not to mention, there were plenty of meaty pieces to go around. Can be a bit pricey, but definitely a fun place to go with a large group!"}
{"text":"Some of the best seafood outside of Hong Kong.   IMPORTANT: if you are visiting from the US, bring CAD! they do not accept US credit/debit cards. Plus we get such a great exchange rate now that it makes this meal a true steal. Also if you are coming Friday or Saturday make a reservation, it would be terrible if you come all the way from the States and can't get a table, this is a really popular place.  We got the meal for 4 and it was $127 CAD plus 10% service fee. It's a little more than $100 for a 5.75 lb lobster, a whole bass, big plate of pea shoots, corn soup, and dessert. In NYC this would be easily $300+. Everything was cooked to perfection, lobster usually don't need too much seasoning because it's so flavorful as is and this restaurant did that 6lb lobster justice with taste. They also have live King crab which is pretty hard to find outside of big cities and it's at a reasonable price of $50CAD per lb. Not bad for live at all.   The next time I'm up in the Toronto area, this place is a must eat. Happy times eh!"}
{"text":"This is a place that's very nice to come when you have a big group of people.  The servings here are pretty big (seafood wise), but comes with a hefty price.    First off, cash only.  Even though their meals are at least $100.00 + per table, make sure you bring your cash.  They have many different set meals, we came with a party of 8.  And ordering the set meant for 8 people....Way too much food!!  The presentation of the food is beautiful, instragram worthy.  And they show you the lobster/crab/king crab prior to cooking so you could take a picture with it. However when they say 40lbs of lobster included in your set meal, it means anything over 40 lbs.  They will most likely find 2 lobsters that are heavier, and then you have to pay the difference based $/lbs. Our lobster was 40.3lbs. And she charged us the 0.3 lbs! So we asked her to find one that was less, and she said sorry no, there's no more lobster smaller!! LOL come on...you have like 8 tanks of lobsters! So then we have to pay an extra $20.00 on top of an already expensive set meal.  Usually when it's a set price, i expect to pay that price.  We got king crab done 2 ways.  Legs steamed, and body fried. The Lobster and Crab were presented nicely, had a nice taste.  The fried garlic was plenty, but started to taste bitter after a while.  The king crab was a little spicy, but tasted better than the lobster did.  We also had 3 fishes, a plate of veggies, an 10 cans of pop.  Was pretty expensive at $800.00.  $100.00/head.  Come once, experience it, but that's about it.  They were able to pack our food for us at the end, and put them into big containers (not the styrofoam boxes), but when you bring it home, it just doesn't taste as good anymore.  Elect for a smaller meal, and finish it there."}
{"text":"I desperately want to give this place 5 stars. The food is worth it (yes, the not so great experience I had last time was just a fluke). I can't though because of the limitations the restaurant has on ordering. Last time I came, my party sat at two tables. We wanted to order two different set meals and share food between the tables so we could try a larger variety. It explicitly states on their menu that this is not allowed, so we didn't, even though we were technically all one party. This time, my party was all at one table, and we wanted to order two different smaller set dinners. This still isn't allowed. It's more than a tad disappointing.  That being said, the food is drool-inducing. I knew I was coming for dinner, so I deliberately ate less during the day to stuff myself silly tonight, and that I most certainly did.   We were a party of 11, and we ordered seafood dinner A for 8-10 people ($399), then added the lobster roe fried rice (see previous review) and 3 bowls of steamed rice ($1.50 each).  Set meal (comes with daily soup, dessert, and bottle of white wine, which was a pinot grigio, 2013):  Oyster with honey pepper sauce (10) - slightly sweet, quite peppery, but in a pleasant way. Oysters were juicy and plump and large.   Steamed eel with black bean sauce (1.5 lb) - hot and fresh (well, everything was), just the right amount of bite, black bean sauce not overwhelming.  Poached snow pea tips - large dish of snow peas piled up into a snow pea mountain. I really like snow peas. These were yummy (and so was everything else).  Steamed double bass (3 lb)- this looks odd. To avoid ambiguity, it should probably read two steamed bass. It's not a steamed large string instrument. I digress. Didn't try it. Too much other stuff to eat. Heard it was delicious, fresh, and the texture was great.  Lobster (12 lbs) - had 6 lbs of it Hong Kong style (the deep fried mountain with fried silver fishes and fried garlic). Paid an extra $5 to have the other 6 lb steamed. Such a good idea. Steamed lobster was cracked open for us and topped with garlic and green onions, which really brought out the sweetness in the lobster.  Crab with ginger and green onion (4.5 lb) - the most difficult dish to eat, although they did have the shell cracker. Still, meat inside was tender and sweet.  Dessert was black sesame sweet soup. They also brought out complimentary birthday peach buns (see previous review).  Best part is and probably always will be the lobster.  Quirky thing of the night: One of the owners was sitting at a table behind us. Someone at our table commented on the crab. Owner struck up a conversation with him. Before leaving, owner gave him a coupon for a free 6 lb lobster the next time he came! I want that coupon =(  Highlight of the night: When we say lobster mountain, we do not kid. They have a set dinner with 50 lbs of lobster. Today, I saw this monstrosity (in the best way possible) with my own eyes. It took 2 male servers to carry this out to the table (not ours, unfortunately).  Most tables had a couple people stand up to take pictures of this gargantuan platter than they would never partake in. It was a momentous occasion.  Final word. Mmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Completed 1 of my goals in the toronto trip- eating lobster at this restaurant! My family was so amazed seeing this huge lobster! Ordered the 138 lobster combo. There was a 5.5lb lobster HK style. steamed bass, soup, pea sprout, and dessert were also included. This is such a good deal, as 2lb small lobster in Vancouver can easily cost over $50! The seasoning (deep fried onion and salangid) was very tasty, but the meat itself, especially the large pieces is relatively bland (this part, 4star). I can convince myself this is due to the lobster was so fresh and strong, the flavour won't go into the meat easily.  The steamed bass is another one of my favourite dishes, it tasted authentic like how my shanghainese grandma used to cook for me. Also very fresh.  Pea sprout, it was a large portion that we had to pack home together with the lobsters. If I come with 4+ group, i would really want to try their king crab combo.  I personally like the lobster's flavour on the second day when I microwaved it. It seemed the seasoning went deeper into the meat. Bonus."}
{"text":"Always good place for lobster. Lobster mountain looks amazing. Lunch special is good. We spend like $65 per person."}
{"text":"Decided in the last minute to go out for dinner on Canada Day and called for reservation, surprised to find that they could accommodate us at a 4:00 pm seating.  That was OK because we had a mid-morning brunch and nothing else.  We ordered the combo dinner for 4: Corn Soup, steamed Sea Bass, Lobster Mountain HK style, Fried Rice, and Snow Peas shoots.  Lobster is guaranteed to be at least 5.5 lb.  If it's bigger than 5.5 lb, you do need to pay for the extra weight by lb, based on market price.  They ran out on 5.5 lb lobster (or maybe they are reserved for diners at 6 pm seating).  They substituted two smaller lobsters for the big one and we had no problem because personally, we like smaller lobsters because their meat is more tender.  But they need to be at least 1.75 lb to be fleshy enough.  Ours was about 2.85 lb each so they were just right.  The lobsters were really fresh and meaty, no \"shrinkage\", sign that they were not starved, therefore fresh.  But they ran out of the tiny fish that usually came with it, and substituted them with French Fries.  They are not the same.  We found the much-loved flavour gone.  The soup was runny and quite tasteless, the steamed bass was fresh and good but slightly undercooked. Snow peas shoots were old shoots; therefore, they were tough and also tasteless.  The dessert (Black Sesame Paste) was also runny and flavourless.  Overall, the dinner was still enjoyable and no MSG (or minimal).  Maybe that's why most dish were tasteless, lol.  We have had better lobsters but this place wasn't bad.  However, service was subpar even by Chinese restaurant's standard.  A server dumped the fish on our table and took off, without leaving us any serving utensils.  We tried to flag down a waiter and finally got one.  She took one look and realized the problem (they supposed to serve you); unfortunately, the fish had cooled down somewhat.  As she cut it, she also realized that it was undercooked, left us the part that was cooked and took the undercooked part back to the kitchen to be \"cooked by pouring hot oil on it\".  We had to raise our hands numerous time to get attention.  No one refilled our teapot and changed our plates.  At 4:00 - 5:00 pm, the place was not full and not very busy.  10% service charge was automatically added in our bill.  A common practice in Hong Kong but not so common here in Canada.  So pay attention before you pay your bill."}
{"text":"a friend of mine heard about this place and encouraged me to try it also. As a group of 7, we were ready for some serious seafood.  the decor of this place was neat - walls upon walls of live crabs and lobsters swimming around. neat but creepy, the crab was too close to the dining tables and they were literally watching us eating.. crabs. -_- I woulda been okay with like one fish tank at the entrance but not having these creatures starring at me.  the pricing/menu of this place is beyond confusing. there's gotta be like 5/6 different menus, each has 20-30 pri-fixe options you can go with. big suggestion to the owner: ORGANIZE YOUR MENU. I freaked out because i saw a menu option for 8 people that costs like 800 dollars. okay nope, a bit overkill, esp during seafood season. they do have cheaper options that essentially serve more or less the same thing - but of course the server only directs your attention to the pricey options.   another thing, they NEVER have the lobster that matches the weight of the options you pick. on the pri-fixe menu it gives you a 6 lb lobster - but they just DONT have lobsters that size, or do not have smaller lobster that can add to this weight. I had an argument with the waiter... why put this on your menu to confuse people??? just give me the price/pound so we're not wasting 15 min over why my meal gives me a 6 lb shellfish but you insist you can only sell me 7-8 lb or more.   food was okay. lobster was fried (too much fried/burnt garlic), crab was fried (awesome! the flavor was great), chicken soup  with no salt ( and i was told not to eat the chicken in my soup), stir fried mushroom and veggies (ok), steam fish was gaping mouth (pretty good, and yes that was hilarious), eel? (was kind of like fish, i liked it). Can't remember wat else we had. most memorable thing was the crab. plus wine, we each paid like 50 bucks for our meal.   another thing: bring loads of cash. please this is not a mom-and-pop diner that's  trying to keep the cost low. it's a place where they price pri-fixed things upwards 1000 dollars a table. let people use their cards... i kept on picturing someone paying with a roll of cash with a rubber band over it. okay seriously too inconvenient.   So here's the verdict: I liked the crab, and that's it."}
{"text":"We got there at 3.30pm 6/23/17, we didn't make reservation but lucky, when we walked in, the manager served us right away.  And still lunch hour, so we got the better deal. This is our last day in Toronto, we hear about lobster tower a lot, here we are for a taste before head home tomorrow. We got a lunch combo, lobster tower HK style 4.20 lbs, veggies with berry & lobster fried rice, plus a black bean desert.= total $88.00 Canadian currency including tips.   We have had a lot of lobsters cook in different style, and this one completely different.  SO GOOD...I don't know if I ever have a chance to come back, but it's worth for the trip after all the hustle freeway, traffic from Toronto downtown..For the price, I think it's pretty good deal.  Hope some info. will help your adventure with Lobster Tower."}
{"text":"Eating here was one of the most legendary dining experiences of my life. Upon entering this huge restaurant with large round tables intended for small groups/family style seating. You become mesmerized by the HUGE lobsters and crabs in the fish tanks. Be prepared to shell out some cash for a memorable seafood meal."}
{"text":"Nice place. We tried recommended combo plate. Average is about $60 per person. Recommended to make reservation at least a day in advance."}
{"text":"Got the $88 5lb lobster dinner set for 2. Came with a huge \"black\" chicken soup, pea tips with goji berries, lobster row fried rice and  black sesame dessert. All huge portions and such a good deal. The lobster we got was a little over 5lbs so the waiter informed us the extract lbs that we had to pay extra. Everything was listed and written down so definitely no price gauging here.   Definitely will be back to try the crab dinner next time."}
{"text":"Great Spot for Lobster lovers. I like the taste and the quality of the lobsters they serve. Very tender, very well cooked, and tasty. The place itself is nice, surrounded by lobsters and King Crab all around in wall glass aquariums. Presentation of the plates is also nice. With that much people inside, it gets really noisy - would be nice if they played a bit of music to hide the noise. They dont have a variety of other seafood dishes, its mostly about Lobster and King Crab.  The dessert and Soup, Not soo great- but who comes here for those anyways :D  I recommend going in a group of 6 or more, so that you could try different flavors. The more, the better, as their plates are all huge."}
{"text":"Food are delicious and service is good but, 1) the amount you see your seafood before it's cooked and the amount is serve on the table is different. They give you less. 2) this place is pretty expensive, but I won't Mind paying for the amount if they were honest with their business. 3) might need to reconsider about this place 4) they always try to sell you a bigger size crab or lobster even though you refuse to 5) every dish basically taste the same."}
{"text":"A popular staple seafood restaurant in Scarborough that is consistently busy day and night and known for their Lobster Tower combos. I highly recommend you get your cameras and cellphones ready when the lobster tower comes out because it's definitely worth the picture and then some. When you enter the restaurant, you see tanks around the restaurant filled with crabs, lobster and other seafood. Normally, it's best to make a reservation here otherwise it will be very hard to get a table but luckily we did make a reservation in advance. I've been here a few times and they have these mega combos for different group sizes. My friend and I ordered the combo for 5 people and you get a corn soup, a bottle of Pinot Grigio wine, a veggie dish and we upgraded to about a 15 lbs pound lobster. It does take a bit long before the food comes out but it's understandable given the food order and the fact that the restaurant is always super packed. We got our soup and other side dishes out first. Corn soup was decent and the veggies were alright. We finally got the Lobster Tower 45 minutes later and we were impressed at the size of the tower. There were probably at least 4-5 big lobsters in that tower and it was covered with these small fishes that you could also eat. They cooked the lobster very well here and it's seasoned nicely and quite the unique flavor. It's definitely worth it to experience the Lobster Tower on a special occasion but I wouldn't come here consistently. Overall, a really good fine dining experience and I highly recommend it for those special occasions when you come here."}
{"text":"Our out of town guests were very impressed with the lobster Hong Kong style. We went back again because our guests really enjoyed the lobster so much! The new location is also much better than the old one.  Service is very quick! Perfect place to impress your guests and celebrate!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  I'm not a huge fan of lobster but I was was still drooling over the thought of the lobster dish even a few days after we ate there.  Decor was fancy for a Chinese restaurant.  Service was also good for a Chinese restaurant.  Price was very high for a Chinese restaurant.  Overall I would come back probably only for special occasions."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese seafood restaurant in town! They are famous for their GIANT fried lobster and crab platters. You will not miss it, almost every table orders one of these! Each plate looks like a small mountain of seafood piled to the tallest possible height without falling over. Therefore, make sure you go with a big group of people, because you WILL need some help finishing all of it.  The food here is very authentic and absolutely delicious. You can't go wrong with almost all of their seafood dishes. Also, try the crab fried rice (served with a big crab shell on top of the rice), it is to die for!  Make reservations beforehand, because it tends to be very busy for dinner and on the weekend. The service is not the best here and the restaurant is very noisy when it's packed, but that's when you know you've stumbled upon an authentic Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place for lunch with my buds. Amazing presentation, bigger the lobster, higher the tower! I enjoyed just about everything however, I wish they offer more streamlined English menu :("}
{"text":"While visiting my sister in Canada, my family of 4 adults was here for my BD. Although my sister was praising about this place (she was here 2 weeks earlier, by the way). I wasn't impressed at all, from food to service... By living in So Cal, I'm not strange with these types of seafood. Compare to Newport Seafood, Kim Su or Seafood Cove #2 in Little Saigon, food from this restaurant wasn't even closed, and they don't cost you an arm or leg. Lol.  First of, you pick a combo menu including snow crab, lobster... they'll tell you the size of snow crab or lobster depends on the price of combo that you choose. Next, they'll tell you they don't have any crustaceans with the size from the menu, HOWEVER, they do have the BIGGER ones, so, you have to pay more. Sound familiar anyone???  Then, they'll bring out the snow crab and lobster for you to take pictures as souvenir. These are scam tactics from some seafood restaurants in California, and here we are, this restaurant is another one. After chosing how your food would be prepare, we waited for 20' before food was served. When my sister looked @ the crab legs dish, she told me:\"Wait a minute, how come this snow crab is bigger, cost more, but, it's less than what I had 2 weeks ago.\" Well, because they cheated on you. That's why.\" I said. They would bring out the big one to show it to you, but, cooked the smaller one. Typical ripped off. Dishonest. Food tasted so so as I stated above. Service was terrible. No one ever came to refill water or replace dirty dishes unless we flagged them down... It cost us $418 with NO SODA, NO BEER, NO WINE ordered. For a meal that cost more $100/person, IT ISN'T WORTH it, people. This place is just a HYPE.  These are some warnings if you decide to go here: - NO CREDIT CARD ACCEPTED. Even issued by Canadian's bank. (Perhaps, for tax evasion purposed. Lol). - CASH or Canadian's DEBIT CARD ONLY. - TIPS AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDE onto bill."}
{"text":"Great seafood restuarant. This place is famous for their enormous lobster tower. Its quite good for the price but you get sick of it after a few pieces cuz its so big. They have alot of dinner combos with variety of seafood. However for first comers, I would come during their lunch hours first to try their combos. The lunch combos are a lot cheaper, so you can try it out first before coming for dinner. Because dinner combos are at least a few hundred dollars, so see if you like it first from their lunch combos before investing more. Service is fast and decors are great. The place is quite popular so be sure to make reservations."}
{"text":"The party I was with had a reservation for 11 at 8:30pm on a Friday. I don't think it would have been possible to get a table without one, because this restaurant was quite full until past 10pm.  You walk in and are immediately surrounded by seafood. There is a tiny aquarium that's home to a giant fish... which definitely did not appear to have enough room in its tank. 3 rows of tanks lined the walls of the entire restaurant, home to crabs, eels, and lobsters.   My party ordered the lobster combo for 6-8, which included chicken broth soup, 24 lbs of lobster (fried HK style), some greens, a black sesame dessert, and a bottle of white wine. Though we had a party of 11, we had read prior reviews about large portion sizes and adjusted our combo choice accordingly.  First, staff members came to us with the lobsters that would be in our meal. We were given the opportunity to hold them... They were huge. We were told that the lobsters chosen weighed 25+ lbs in total, so we would get charged at the per/lb price for the excess. This disclosure was definitely appreciated.   I guess I'll start by talking about the other dishes really briefly... The chicken broth soup was flavourful. The greens were served with the lobster, but were vastly overshadowed. They were good as well. The black sesame dessert was more of a soup than a pudding... Kinda grainy but I learned to like it.  And now on to the main course. the lobster mountain. Two staff members had to lift the platter onto the table. It was a 25 lb mountain of lobster with a lot of fried crisps as filler, and topped with some lettuce. I'd estimate it was at least 2 feet in height. Definitely a photo op you won't want to miss.  We put on the plastic gloves provided and went at it. The flavour was out of this world. Each piece was incredibly juicy, and the amount of salt fried into the shells was just right. We ate piece after piece until the servers came and replaced our plates. In total, we probably had 2 plates full of shells each - quite a good serving.  While this was filling, I think that a little more variety would've been welcomed. I think I ever come back, I'd want to try one of their combos with a little less lobster and a little more of what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"The price is honestly pretty fair, however, I do not like that they always try to up-sell you with a more expensive combo. Each time we go, we are never able to finish the food and end up packing most of it home. For some odd reason, that always end up happening!   The typhoon shelter style is the best. I also like that the use egg whites to steam the crab legs. Very good and bring out the taste of the crab.   Service is also pretty good considering how busy they can get.   This is definitely a place that I will visit again, but not often for the sake of my health!"}
{"text":"The lobster mountain is crazy!!!! Pieces of lobster stir fried in a chilli garlic sauce served over shredded lettuce and fried fish (almost anchovies). Make sure you under-order because we can never finish the size we order to the actual number of people that are there. So if you're a party of 6, just order good for 4. Unless you're really heavy eaters or you can finish the whole lot, go ahead!   We bring our friends who visit from other countries or out of town here. Even they're always shocked to experience this.   We order the lobster mountain with the steamed fish with soy sauce. This set comes with fried lobster rice, some oysters, Chinese broccoli, and the dessert is some black sesame soup (seriously, ditch this and serve even just mango pudding or almond jelly). Seriously. The dessert ruins the whole meal. Some may like it. But the appearance is just not AT ALL appetizing. Might be better off just handing out fortune cookies or orange slices."}
{"text":"If you love lobsters and crabs, this is IT!!!  They only serve whole oversized lobsters and crabs, yes other dishes are good too but why would you?  It is a big place with big portions meant for large groups. We came on a Thursday evening, had a reservation at 8:30 but did not get seated until 9 and finished at 11.  Service was a little slow but understandable given the amount of people and oversized seafood dishes they're hauling around without toppling.  They have a number of set menus to choose from and they bring you the live lobsters and crabs to show what you're getting, more importantly the feast you're about to journey through."}
{"text":"Huge amount of lobsters here! My friend ordered the 50 pound lobster mountain and between the 8 of us we devoured a good 2/3 of it. There's also a huge amount of silver fish between each lobster level as well.   What I liked was that because of the mountain we also received some pop and wine as well. Although my stomach didn't quite agree with the wine and lobster combo. I wish the tray of veggies was bigger because I needed something to clear my palate after eating that much lobster.   I wish they also provided some picks to help grab out the meat as grabbing the meat from the trickier parts were more difficult"}
{"text":"I went to Toronto last month for a weekend getaway with my significant other and some friends and was lucky enough to have a local bring us around town.  After shopping at Pacific Mall for a couple of hours and being surrounded by an overabundance of everything Asian, we drove across the street to Fishman Lobster Clubhouse, a SEAFOOD GALORE, to find ourselves being enclosed by tanks and tanks of crabs, lobsters and eel.  We ordered some dinner combination that came with two plates of lobster, stacked as high as the Twin Towers, as well as some freshly steamed crab legs, fried oysters, eel, soup, vegetables and fried rice.  The restaurant also provided us with some gloves so that we can experience some upscale caveman, seafood devouring, and it was an unforgettable moment.  This was my first time binge seafood eating and it will NOT be my last!"}
{"text":"Although the seafood itself was good I will never go back because of the atrocious service I received. Being Chinese I am used to getting poor service at Chinese restaurants however this is the first time that I have gotten into an argument with the staff. We waited 45 mins with a large group (including several young children) despite having reservations. We were then rushed through our meal with the dishes all coming as soon as they were ready with no type of staggering in between leaving us no time to actually eat our meals. In fact our table ran out of space for the dishes and they still kept trying to ram everything in. They repeatedly told us that we had to leave asap because they had another reservation after ours which was part of a wedding party. They actually tried to convince us to vacate one of the two tables we had and squish all into one table (we had 16 people with 2 high chairs). I understand the dilemma they were in however it was not our fault that we were seated 45 mins later than we were supposed to. Now our family is the type to give the tip directly to our servers because we never know how the owners like to split the tips. When the owner saw that we didn't leave a tip on the actual bill he become really angry and tried to guilt us into giving a 15% tip even though we received horrible service. That was when we lost it. Tips are meant to be a reward for good service. It is not your right to dictate to me how much tip we should give and to whom we should give it. If you want to come here for the food still all the power to you. I however, refuse to pay this much for a meal and be treated like crap."}
{"text":"Ha, we were back the following year for a birthday. For four, we had the 5 lbs and added steamed fish. Still very good"}
{"text":"Great presentation (live seafood brought to your table in a bucket, then turned into towers of batter fried parts) with authentic Chinese service-- expect to be rushed, oversold, then ignored. Food was a bit greasy and the cooking style doesn't really bring out the taste you might expect from high quality fresh seafood."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! The place is packed when we got there around 7pm. Fortunately there's an empty table for two so we got seated right away. We got the king crab combo for two and food were served within 15 minutes. Very impressed! Overall food is excellent, my favorite is definitely the fried king crab legs - got a little kick to it. In terms of service, if I could give it a six star I would - food were served promptly and plates were replaced in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday and this place is perfect for large group considering how big most of their seafood dishes are.  First let's talk about the food.  This place is known for their seafood, you can do anything from crab, lobsters, fish and anything you can think of that is edible from the sea.  Also, there are many flavours you can choose from on how you want your food to be cooked in.  With a group of 12+, we had lobsters, king crab legs, rice, fish and a veggie dish which were all included in a meal combo we ordered.  Overall the seafood are pretty fresh and they are well-made.  They also give you plastic gloves, so you can eat everything with your hand and it makes digging meat out from shells that much easier.  Only thing I do not like about this place is all servers will try to upsell you to go with the more expensive \"combo\" no matter how many people you have.  I am guessing servers get commission on up-selling?  This way of doing business really irritates me.  Price wise, this place is on the high end, but considering how good the food and how fresh the seafood were, I thought the price justifies itself.  In conclusion, this place is good to come with a large group of seafood lover, also do not be persuaded by the up-selling tactics from the servers and you should be able to enjoy a good meal"}
{"text":"We drove 8 hrs from NYC to get to this place after so many family members & friends ate here & raved about it, so I'm surprised that this place has such low ratings! The food was phenomenal at bargain price (though not cheap), & our waiter was super funny. Only downside was that we didn't make reservations & had to wait an hour for our (sheltered) outdoor seating.  We got the dinner for 10-12 people & we were a party of 6, so yea, there were TONS of left-overs. It was the dinner with two lobsters (14+ lbs of lobster), oysters, king crab, fish, rice, eel... I forget what else. We were super excited & still pumped when the mountain of lobster came (3rd dish served), but halfway through, were were like, \"There's more?!?!\" After eating here, you won't want to eat seafood for a while. It was easily $600-800 Canadian dollars, but the leftovers were good enough for 2 more meals, so... less than $40 USD per person, per meal.  Will definitely recommend to friends & re-visit next time we're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Treated my mom to a lobster dinner because she deserves it hell yeah! The service was great. Staff are very efficient but could be a bit more attentive. This place is very family friendly and good for big groups. Would not recommend it for dates. It's really busy and loud so I wouldn't really consider it as \"fine dining.\" However, the price is the same as fine dining restaurants so be prepared to spend booboo. I guess if you're in a big group and split the cost or something it might be cheaper but I paid for everything myself so that's why I'm clearly being \"extra\" about it ;). There were some improvements that could be made. For example, our cutlery wasn't the cleanest so we had to ask for replacements and we also had to ask for lobster cracker utensils. They literally gave us the lobster, 2 knives and were like \"here ya go!\" Nah fam. What if I got my nails done that day? I would have failed terribly. Just saying if I was that girl ;) but I keep my nails natural so its cool lol no problemo. They do crack open the lobster a bit for you but a lot of it has to be cracked open by you as well. Also in terms of hygiene........yeah some improvements should be implemented. The place is pretty old and could use a revamping to make it less dingy but that's really getting into aesthetics so I'm not going to go there. You can still take great pictures though fam no worries with that at all. CASH OR DEBIT honey! Come on y'all should know by know. I've never been to any asian-owned establishment where they have a \"credit card\" option. Why you actin' all surprised?! Get it together!!"}
{"text":"A bit too crowded, not a place to go to if you just want to relax and enjoy your meal. Most items on the menu are quite expensive and not for group of one or 2 people. But if you have never tried the restaurant and want to go in large group then it could an interesting experience"}
{"text":"You come for the experience and return for the food. Amazing family style seafood with a very lively atmosphere. The staff all seems to be very engaging and attentive. I had heard, prior to arrival that they had attityisdues with the hosting staff but my experience was they got that addressed.  Maybe it's just me BUT 9 out of 10 Asain resturaunts suffer from \"under performing\" washrooms (Canadian)/restrooms (US) and this place upholds tgat stereotype...so ladies \"go before you go\"....you'll thank me someday!"}
{"text":"Called for a dinner reservation on our way to Toronto from NYC last weekend and was told that they were full and the only availability was 4:30pm! Since we can't make a trip to Toronto without dining at this place, we took the 4:30pm reservation. We then drove directly to the restaurant once we arrived in Toronto only to find that they have moved to another location! Luckily, it's just  a few blocks up. Their new place is nicer and probably slightly bigger BUT they don't offer their old prix fixe anymore! Everything is more expensive :( Although the food is still better compared to Cantonese food in NYC, it is not as good as before. Still cash only and RSVP in advance! This place is packed by 6pm and we saw so many people without rsvp being turned away."}
{"text":"You're definitely paying for the experience. The food is quite expensive but worth it if you have a large party. I think that taste wise, it's comparable to other Chinese restaurants that charge a lot less. In this place, they actually bring out the lobster/crab for you to take a picture with before it becomes your meal. We had a lobster in 4 styles. My favorite one was the hong kong style lobster! It was delicious and crunchy. The steam one was okay that came with butter and lemon. It also came with soup, rice, veggies and sesame dessert. There was plenty of food for five people. Great for special occasions but definitely pricey."}
{"text":"Worth every single penny! The price on the menu looks expensive, but their lobsters are huge and soooo good! I also like the fried garlic on the top. They also offer a free soup and a vegetable dish, even these free food were decent. This is really place to go with your friends or family, coz you have to share with this portion ;)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here in the past but this was my first time at the new location. The new location is so much better than the old one. Not only is it much bigger (over twice the size of the old one), but now they have their own parking lot in the back so parking is much easier. There is also a decent sized seating area to wait for a table now. They kept the decor concept similar to the old location with tanks full of seafood surrounding the entire restaurant.   Food here was delicious as always. The lobster is my favourite. You can have it cooked several ways and they are all good. You can't go wrong ordering it.   After you order they bring out the lobster/crab out to show you and tell you how much it weights. You can even take pictures with the seafood at this point if you want. The staff are used to everybody asking to take pictures and would gladly offer to take a picture for you as well.   The only thing that I didn't like about the meal was that our table was too small. Our food didn't all fit on our table and the plates knocked over cups as we turned the table.   This is my favourite place to eat lobster and I will be back"}

{"text":"Located in a small plaza near Brimley and Steeles, this small restaurant has been in business for over 10 years. I can guarantee that you will probably be turned away if you walk in on a weekend, so make reservations in advance! The parking is almost impossible, as it is small and doesn't offer many spaces when it gets packed.  The interior itself gives the impression of a tacky, old restaurant. People really just come in for the seafood, rather than to enjoy the ambience. Coming through the entrance, you'll notice a number of tanks filled with humongous lobsters and fish. There are about 10 tables around and a patio outside. Though the patio consists of plastic tables and chairs, so nothing to be excited about.  Ordered: (On two occassions)  Undoubtedly, one of the biggest and freshest served lobsters I have ever eaten. Costs about $15-16 per pound, so it doesn't come cheap. They pile the lobsters like a mountain; it's ridiculous. But you know you won't be fighting over pieces at your table. There will be enough to satisfy any lobster cravings for awhile.   Lobster with deep fried garlic - Yes, the lobster is fresh and succulent. But the amount of deep fried garlic was just too overwhelming to really enjoy the natural sweetness of the lobster.   Lobster with stir fried ginger and onions - I usually do enjoy my lobsters prepared this way at Chinese restauransts. There is an attracting aroma when it comes out, making you lick your fingers for more.   This restaurant has been consistent over the years, sticking to their own traditional way of preparing lobsters. It has gained many loyal customers that come back. So give it a try for the seafood, not for the ambience."}
{"text":"Aggressive Up-Selling!  We had combo 11 (dinner for 6), which was $225 I think. It included: 1) Soup of the day (corn and egg drop, I think) 2) Fried lobster (supposed to be 6lbs - more on this later) 3) Fried crab (2.5lbs) 4) Fried Oyster 5) Steamed fish with ginger and green onions 6) Eel 7) Pea sprouts 8) Dessert - might have been an almond soup  We tried reserving (one day in advance) for a 6pm seating but were told they only had 4pm or 8:30pm seatings available, so we took the 4pm seating.  What was most off-putting was the aggressive up-selling. As many other Yelpers have pointed out, they try to get you to buy more lobster than what you've ordered. We ordered the 6lb lobster that came with the combo, but were told that they were out of 5 and 6lb lobsters. We were not allowed to order a 4lb lobster with a discounted price. They offered us a 7lb one at $17/lb on top of the original price. In the end we agreed to this - but then they brought out a 7.5lb one. By that time they had worn us down so we just agreed.  The food was good as usual. Putting aside the up-selling, it is quite the dining event and if you have the $$ I'd recommend trying it at least once.  Pros: Tasty food Instagram-worthy crab and lobster  Cons: Tables stacked too close to each other - makes getting out of your chair difficult Aggressive up-selling of lobster Not easy to get a reservation for 6pm They don't take credit cards"}
{"text":"Very crowded & loud even on a weekday.   Some items worth mentioning were:  Clams in Beer which was simple but tasty.    Lobster with Deep Fried Garlic, lets call it garlic with a side of lobster, there were tons of shredded garlic & though the lobster was large the flesh was not very tasty due to the lobster being too old. However it was fun to consume as I never had quite as large a lobster as this before.  Dungeness Crab on a bed of anchovies, lots of flavour but also lots of batter, it came with crab innards in fried rice. This was my 2nd most favourite dish.  Black Bean Sauce Braised Eel - I never had eel sectioned up into \"steaks\" before, but I love it! No silly little bones to choke & die on, just once central vertebra, was tender so flavourful, the flesh can be described as something between a sea & land creature. This was my favourite dish of the night! Now I want to go the market & buy some live eels & make me some eel steaks.  For a seafood binge this place seems like an alright destination, although I will look for better seafood places in the meantime."}
{"text":"Very rushed - you should only be staying 1 hour, max 1.5 hours if you want a few dirty looks near the end. They add on a 10% gratuity automatically onto your bill. It's cash or debit only. Tables are extremely cramped together, seating is very narrow and servers will dictate where at a table to sit so that there's actually aisle space and room for serving. It's a one off experience, but not an enjoyable one and probably not where you want to be treating guests from out of town, especially if you want a calm meal to chat and catch up. The food itself is good and frankly, expected for the price you pay.   We ordered a set meal for 2-3 people, which was supposed to come with a 2-2.5 pound lobster. However, our server informed us that they had no lobsters under 3.5pounds, so they would have to charge us for the extra poundage, since our set was only supposed to come with a 2-2.5 pound lobster. Although we obliged to add on the extra $13 (on top of a $40 meal, a 33% increase!), I was extremely annoyed at their service. They were effectively forcing us to go for a larger lobster and take on that extra surcharge. Given that the 2-3 people set menu was even an option on the menu, the restaurant should have been well equipped to have appropriately sized lobsters in their tank, and not one that was much larger than the required poundage. For a set that should have only been $40, we ended up paying an extra $13 solely because of something the restaurant did not have. It was entirely their mistake, and they should have been the ones to take on that surchage.  P.S. make reservations for lunch or dinner weeks in advance - they book up early!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very unique. Everything very fresh. Amazing food presentation. Lobster and crabs towers were very impressive. Amazing decor with live king crabs and lobsters. Very good, quick and polite customer service."}
{"text":"Sat out on the patio today. People, do not be afraid of the cold when sitting on the patio. It's enclosed and the heat lamps provide enough heat for you to take off your jacket and get at that lobster with all your might.  Had the 6 person meal with lobster and crab for $197. The difference between this and the 4 person meal is like $10 and you get 2 more dishes. It came with clams that had a really nice wine taste, some veggies and mushrooms (decent), steamed eel which was really nice and fresh, fried crab and a 6lb fried lobster.  People, when they say 6lb on there, they will not be giving you 6lb. I have a feeling they do this on purpose, for every 6lb lobster you choose, they'll bring you a 6.6lb lobster. Because the pricing is based on 6lb, so then they'll charge you for the extra the lobster is since they can't \"find\" a 6lb version. By that time, you won't say no.  But the meat on this thing, with the fried garlic on top, it's good. Personally though, I like the fried version with little fishies on top cause it has a bit more flavor.  Still taste good either way."}
{"text":"I head heard many bad things about this place, like slow service, inattentive staff, or even bad mannered staff. I start to wonder if people are over exaggerating or have sky high expectations.  I came here for lunch and we were seated relatively fast while the entire restaurant was quite full as well. There was less than five minutes wait time.  The menu can be somewhat of an adventure as it was detailed and had listed out exactly what you can get and the side options. When we were ready to order the waiter was quick prompt and within five minutes he has brought the seafood over to show us the size and what we were getting.  Less than ten minutes after ordering food came piling out til our table being a large table could barely accommodate all the dishes that was ordered. Overall I was impressed with presentation and how fresh tasting and how the food was overall. I had expected some bland tastes but overall it was spicy and flavourful and much better than I had anticipated. The crab was four main courses with sides and it was simply divine being steamed. My only complaint would be I would rather the head to be steamed or fried and let us enjoy that for the crab.  When I have a chance to revisit I can't wait to try this place again. On a small note most places within Canada always offer male crabs but females are quite rare and not usually offered as they aren't commonly sold. The nice thing was they do offer the female king crab the only thing Is they are usually 9-10 pounds per female crab and at the moment it was way to large for our table. Overall I will be back to try this place again. Five star service and tasty factor for me."}
{"text":"This is a giant warehouse of a restaurant. There were so many patrons I felt a bit like I was at a wedding. We ordered the $388 combo which was the smallest combo and still too much food for 11 people. This combo comes with 1 bottle of wine and 10 soft drinks of your choosing, and yes, they have C Plus.   Let's cut right to the chase - the point of going to this restaurant is to take a picture with a gargantuan (how are they not genetically modified?) crustacean and then take another picture of the crustacean mountain that is presented to you after they cook it. The mountain is literally covered in piles of deep fried garlic, which is delicious albeit heart attack-inducing. You are given disposable plastic gloves with which to attack the mountain. And then you (morbidly?) eat the lobster in front of literally hundreds of live lobsters watching you from the aquariums that line the walls of this place. The lobster pieces were the meatiest I've ever had, but not the best in flavour. I prefer Wah Sing lobster with the black bean sauce and the ginger sauce.   The other dishes that come with the combo are hit-or-miss. The crab was tasty but pretty difficult to eat. The fried rice, soup appetizer, and fried oysters were meh. I enjoyed the beef dish and sweet and sour pork a lot. The snow pea shoots were pretty good as well.   They add automatic 10% tip to your bill and accept cash and debit. I think it's a fun and interesting experience, but I probably wouldn't go back until my cholesterol levels normalize."}
{"text":"Should def make a ressie here...every table had the mountain style lobster or king crab...since we had the king crab the other night we opted for the lobster...a 6.5 pound lobster didn't look so big compared to others but it was plenty of food"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get their fried lobster with a group of 10+ people. We came here for CNY last year and it was awesome."}
{"text":"overpriced Asian joint but flavourful seafood options worth taking friends and family visiting.   Don't expect healthy   Staff push and pressure to buy order more and larger portions   Kinda annoying"}
{"text":"Famous for their lobster towers this place is where you want to go if you want to see shocked expressions of your dining companions!  Located in Scarborough this place is always jumping jumping so definitely make reservations!  We ordered the 30lb lobster tower (I believe there is a 50lb one as well).  We also ordered fried rice and some veggies and got a free bottle of wine.  Get your gloves on and just dig in...seriously just dig in.  Grab away and sink your teeth in all that delicious lobster.  It's piled high with fried anchovies as well.  I'd seriously suggest wearing stretchy pants :)   The menu recommends that for this size 6-8 people will do but we had 11 people and just barely were able to finish it.    I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"this is the second experience at this restaurant and it will also be the last. The price is constantly rising and the quality of food and service has decreased. The HK style lobster is no longer the same. Before it was small fried fish sauteed with garlic. Now the restaurant replaced the small fish with fried potatoes with homemade Sriracha sauce. Waitresses have terrible attitudes. The manager does not want to give us a copy of the bill despite having charged use taxes and service charges. It's not worth going to this restaurant, it is just a hype."}
{"text":"First impression of their new location: not bad! The inside of the restaurant is wall to wall aquariums of swimming lobsters, fish, crabs and eels but if you can get past that; it's not bad!  Typical to real Chinese restaurants comes the customizable tables where they roll in different sized table tops to throw on top of the table's base in order to accommodate different sized crowds.  If you have never witnessed this before, then you're in luck... You get a free show with your dinner! ;)  Now on to the food.  They have several combos available which they'll try to up-sell to you to suit your party and your taste buds. For this trip, as we've been here before, we ordered a la carte.   With a party of 10 adults and 5 children, we ordered:  3 Lobster Fried Rice 2 Beef and Cashew with Beans Eggplant  Mushroom & Chinese Broccoli   5 lb Hong Kong style Lobster 5 lb Dry Garlic Fried Lobster  Steamed Fish   Lobsters were juicy, succulent, and very tasty! The fried dry garlic had a sweetness that enhanced the natural sweetness of the lobster's and as always, it didn't disappoint! Even those who weren't fans of lobster were licking their fingers after every bite.    One thing to note about the lobsters, you ask for 5lb, they'll give you 5.7 or 5.8 so you're charged for 6lbs so keep that in mind when you order.   The steamed fish for me, was average for a Chinese restaurant but definitely clean... The people in my party DEVOURED it!!   The Cashew beef was really good; surprisingly very tender and flavorful so definitely another must!   Lobster fried rice - need I say more?   The eggplant, though my friends enjoyed it, was my least favorite part of the meal.  I found it was tasty but nothing special.  Would've saved the space for the lobsters instead!   As usual, the meal came with soup (which the kids in my table LOVED and requested seconds) and black sesame soup.  The first time I tasted it was Devine!!! This time, however, we found it lacking in sweetness... As it's free, however, guess I can't complain!  All in all, a GREAT meal for under $400.  My advice:  Reserve in advance Bring LOTS of cash - cards are not accepted though there is a bank next door Order one lb less of lobster than you intended  Don't over order as its easy to do so; you can always add on to your order if it's not enough  And feel free to take lots of pictures!!! Everyone else is doing it so you might as well join in! :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I feel like this place is over-hyped. The only thing really impressive is the presentation of the fried lobster tower.  The food is just okay. You get to pick your own crab and lobster and set meal (how you would like your food prepared). I remember the first time I had lobster sashimi here it was really good, but I don't know if this place is really worth the price after the first time.  I feel like this place is more of a novelty experience, especially if you have people visiting Toronto from other places. It's not bad, but it's not that great of a restaurant either."}
{"text":"The lobster friends are so delicious! Their specialty is definitely seafood. Fresh fish, huge lobster, and MSG free dishes.  I love the deep fried garlic bits on the lobster. The lobster is done perfectly, though big, never rubbery.  Service... pretty good for a chinese restaurant  Atmosphere... typical small chinese family restaurant... it's tight seating  Reservations... you HAVE to make reservations on the weekend, or you might have to wait until 9 pm before you can get a table."}
{"text":"The musts before coming to this resto:  1. Must love to eat Lobster and King crab. If you're not a seafood fan, don't walk in. 2. Come hungry... Ok you don't have to be hungry but definitely don't be full... There is a lot of food..,. And leftovers for a whole day 3. Come w. A group... Unless you plan to spend a lot of money and plan to eat leftovers for a full week... Plus you get more tatie ties of seafood 4. Bring a camera... The waitors will bring the seafood for you to inspect before cooking... Take a photo of this beautiful thing before it is deep fried and stacked into a monument of a platter. Take a photo of that too. Take selfies and more photos after you cannot eat anymore and are in food coma.... And the plates still look like it is half uneaten. 5. Make a reservation  - the place isn't small but it's well known. I went to the original location where it was small and that itself was difficult to get a table. Now that this place is an icon, it will be even harder to get in at the time you want. 6. Plan ahead. Make sure you know how big your fish is. Anything that is above the guestimated wait will be charged to your bill... Tough luck for you.  Other than, get ready to eat, be in awe, and leave happy."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place. Saw many photos on social media of these lobster mountains and decided that I needed to check it out for myself. Some friends were in town for the weekend, so it was the perfect opportunity.  It's loud, like most Chinese restaurants, and there are aquariums circling the entire dining room that are filled with live lobsters and crabs. To be honest, I thought it was a tad creepy (I have phobias of things with many legs).  We hummed and hawed between getting king crab, lobster, or both. In the end, we really wanted to get the lobster mountain, so we ordered the \"lobster mountain dinner for 4-5\". It came with a soup for the table (black chicken soup), 15 lbs of HK style lobster, poached snow pea tips with wolf berry, a bottle of wine, and dessert (black sesame soup). The servers were able to accommodate our request to substitute the wine for beers instead. There were 5 of us, and there was definitely enough food to comfortably feed 6 people.  Prior to preparing the meal, the servers brought out our lobsters and we had the opportunity to take photos of them. We were informed that our lobster was a \"bigger lobster\" so would be an extra $17. That was fine with us. (I don't really know if it was bigger or not, but whatever.)  The food came out relatively quickly. The mountain was enormous! It was piled high with large chunks of deep fried lobster, garlic, and tiny fried fish. As hungry as we were, we were unable to conquer the entire lobster mountain and ended up having a tray of leftovers to bring home. It was delicious, but very filling!  I was thankful for the snow pea tips - they were a welcome contrast to the meaty, fried lobster. They also served Japanese ginger (the kind you get with sushi), which was a good palate cleanser.  Service was decent for a Chinese restaurant. We got plastic gloves to wear while eating and the servers offered to change our plates about 5-6 times. After tax and an automatic 10% tip, our bill was about $320. For 5 people, that's really not so bad.   I would consider coming back again in the future to try the king crab. But I've had enough lobster to satisfy me for a lifetime."}
{"text":"**Come here hungry**!  I Noticed this restaurant on a few good  travel shows so I knew he next time I made or to Toronto, I had to give this place a shot! With that being the case, and with a little more motivation, I made my way back  to Toronto one weekend and this place topped my list. The location itself is clean and the walls inside are lined with tanks which are filled with gigantic lobsters and crabs. This gives you a preview of the incredible food to come.   Next , the food comes and various portions which even down to the smallest are a large portion. The menu ranges from various Chineese and seafood specialties. During this visit I ordered the 2 person special. It included a starter, entree, (an added extra side i ordered) and a dessert. The starter I received was a chicken stock based soup. Wasn't bad but it was only the precursor to the real reason for my visit. Next I decided between crab or lobster for my entree. This time I chose the fried lobster. They bring the actual live lobster to your table for you to approve prior to it being cooked. Next I selected my seasoning to cover my fried lobster. It came to the table on a massive plate chopped and stacked to perfection. I would easily say it's more than enough for two individuals. After the meal I was very satisfied and quite full. The dessert included a black sesame paste which was apparently good for digestion. I will definitely visit this place again when I revisit Toronto.  Also as a last note, this place doesn't accept credit/debit cards. So bring cash!"}
{"text":"The prices are high so I keep trying to find somewhere else as a substitute for Fishman Lobster Clubhouse and its impossible to find a restaurant to beat this place. They do their food properly and its absolutely delicious. I have yet to have had a bad time at Fishman Clubhouse. Its great for groups and I will not go anywhere else going forward (i.e. will never, ever go back to Fishman Wharf - Wharf is far inferior to Clubhouse).  Aside from the lobster thats always cooked and presented perfectly - I absolutely love their lobster brains fried rice and their deep fried oysters."}
{"text":"i love this place. Its a great place for celebrating any event or for just going if your a seafood lobster or king crab seafood fanatic. The customer service is great. If you don't have a reservation good luck and forget about it. If you do you'll never be disappointed. I've celebrated anniversaries there, bdays, and more there about 6 times and we always had reservations that we always on time. You don't need to spend over $200 for a family of 4 as we usually get the 5lb lobster hong kong style and its about $130-160 depending on the weight of the lobster(usually between 5lbs-6lbs). $130-$160 isn't including drinking but our family doesn't drink so tea is fine for us. The lobster Hong Kong fried style is so yummmy and you won't be disappointed. At the bottom of the lobster it looks like small fried onion pieces but they are little fish(not sure what ya call it) but they're so tasty. Love everything about this place. Organized, quality of food and freshness. The lobster is live and they show you before they cook it. The management nails all 3 things down of a perfect restaurant. Quality fresh food, price and last great customer service. The reason why i'm so surprised by customer service is because I'm not Chinese and I noticed many Asian/Chinese restaurants usually have horrible service, almost get in and get out. But at this restaurant the service is top notch. Servers greet you with a smile, they check up on you and they have supervisors with ear mic's making sure things run smooth throughout then night! If i could rate 6 out of 5 I would have! A++++ Fishman!"}
{"text":"Not worth the price. Hands can get ultra messy. Came with cousin and his friends. A lot of fun but objectively speaking the restaurant isn't a place I'd rave about. Novel affair if you haven't tried the style of lobster/crab they have but still up selling is their staple. We ordered a 16 pounder. Crab fried rice. Soup. And I can't remember what else.  Came a second time with less than favorable impressions. Service is a bit slow and unrefined. As in theyre clumsy and hate you. Surprised at how many people pop champagne in here though. Bizarrely showy clientele."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sea food restaurant in Toronto. The lobster and crabs are right out of tanks. If you're going to splurge this is the place to do it. Try avoid dinner time; too many people. Lunch time is preferred."}
{"text":"Seafood, seafood, seafood.  When you first walk in you may think you accidentally walked into an aquarium. Panoramic views of tanks filled with your favorite crustaceans surround you. It's definitely not VR, you're in it.  I see tables with mega stacks of fried crab legs resembling a game of  \"Jenga\" unlike the game everything was removed piece by piece from the top.  Unfortunately, the big boss lady did not want the King crab that night as she felt the 3 of us would  not be able to finish. Reluctantly, I agreed and we order the following meal. Vancouver crab prepared with Ginger and scallions served on a bed of lo mein, deep fried oysters with black pepper and honey, snow pea tips with garlic and steamed whole fish. There is a container on each table with plastic gloves in case you don't want to dirty your hands. Listen kids, dish the gloves and eat with your bare hands, get primitive.  The Vancouver crab was very fresh and they bring you the catch to show you before they prepare it, just a side note when ordering this particular dish, it's served with snow pea tips on the side, If I knew it came with snow pea tips I wouldn't have ordered a dish of snow pea tips. The waitress could have done a better job of letting me know that. Now with that said the snow pea tips were perfectly cooked, tender and tasty. I had my fair share of snow pea tips that night. The fish was moist and they place fine slivers of fresh scallions on top, mix that in with the sweet soy sauce they serve with the fish and your taste buds start dancing with joy.  Great meal and attentive service. These folks got the flow down to a science. Remember, cash or debit only. Bring lots of cash because it could cost upwards of $150-200 Canadian dollars a person depending on what you order. As a side note you figure that with all the money $$$$ that this place makes, they should at least have a clean, modern and large bathroom to accommodate patrons."}
{"text":"This place satisfied my seafood obsession. I was amazed by the huge crabs and lobster. The taste of each dishes were good, although some were very plain and different. Our waitress had zero understanding of English, thank goodness my cousin who lives in Toronto is a regular diner at this place so she knew what she was ordering. I would recommend that you do your homework prior to coming here. Overall a must visit while in Toronto."}
{"text":"I swear I had already reviewed this place when they were at their former location but I guess it got lost somewhere along the way. I've never been a fan of deep fried seafood. Well, except maybe crab cakes and fish and chips but those are exceptions. I think seafood should be delicate, pure, un-adulterated food for the virgin. The no-frills approach to seafood is one that I believe best preserves the delicate sweetness and briney-ness and to deep fried is...sorta bastardizing it. But in this day and age of Instagram and FB eating, what often matters most is how many likes I can get with my picture and I can assure you this place will definitely get many likes now matter how bad your photography skills are.  How can you go wrong with deep fried lobster with deep fried condiments? That's like having bacon cooked in bacon fat. However, unlike bacon deep frying most seafood tends to destroy the delicate texture because it does get overcooked. To further complicate things is the batter which seemingly adds a weird crunch to a supposedly delicate, silky meat. I think for the most part, the oil and the batter did an excellent job of masking most of the seafood flavours. In particular the Alaskan king crab suffered the most from the fryer. The meat was limp, bland and overall a little sad. Oh, and that lobster roe fried rice was forgettable at best. The rice is a little too broken down and soaked in water for a little longer than it should of been as it was a tad mushy on the outside with a firm core.  Not all was lost. The chicken soup that came with the meal was one of the best renditions I've ever had. An entire chicken it seems was slowly simmered down the about 8 cups of liquid gold. Throw in a few dates and some traditional Chinese herbs and you've got flavour nirvana! The veggies were nicely done with clean flavours and a satisfying snap when you bite into it. And but I cannot believe I am saying this but the service was exceptional! The server practically stood beside our table the entire night.  It's worthy a visit so you can snap a few photos for your Instagram and FB collection. It's really an unforgettable visual experience and that's were it ends. As for the food... well, it's alright to forgettable."}
{"text":"I don't usually drive to the east for food but I really don't mind driving here all the way for their unique way of cooking seafood.  The two-way fish in congee and grilled fish bone in Maggie's sauce is both my mother's and my favourite.  No need to mention, their Hong Kong style deep-fried mountain lobsters and king crabs set meals are always tempting and super delicious.  Dinner time is usually busier even on week nights.  Reservation is a must.  I enjoy coming here for lunch since there is always good deal lunch set and less people.  Service will be more attentive when this place is less crowded.    They are doing a king crab lunch special (Monday to Friday) from now till October 15, 2015.  I need to go back and try.  I saw a lot of other tables ordering this king crab special, and oh my the presentation was already irresistible.  The restaurant will apply 10% service charge automatically on the bill."}
{"text":"When you make your reservation by phone, double-check the date/time/number of people. Ask for the employee's name. Or if you live nearby, make the reservation in person. If not, you may arrive and find that they screwed up your reservation and won't give you a table!  Hubby and I were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary with friends and family. He made a booking by phone 3 weeks in advance. I know he did it because I was standing next to him when he called. He even double-checked that the telephone number was correct by asking if it was Fishman.  On the day of our dinner, I called more than 10 times to confirm. From 2:30-4 pm, no one answered the phone. We finally decided to drive over and keep our fingers crossed. Sure enough, 2 employees scanned the reservation booking multiple times and could not find our name. :-(  Fortunately, my hubby told them that we were celebrating our 20th anniversary etc etc. Maybe he looked so intimidating (or I looked so hungry!) that they felt sorry for us and gave us a table on the patio. Phew!  It was our 2nd time at Fishman and we enjoyed it immensely. Love the Lobster Tower and the Pinot Grigio offered in the set dinner is not bad either."}
{"text":"Wow big portions! Fresh seafood and very flavourful. Tried both the lobster mountain and the king crab meals and they were both wonderful."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on our first night in Toronto. They moved to the new location on Finch and the place is bigger and nicer. We had 8:30 ressies and showed up about 15 minutes early. The place was packed and people were busting at the seams waiting for a table. There were people waiting inside and outside for a table. We were seated right away since we had ressies. We went with the B set menu. This comes with individual shark fin, abalone on pea Shoots, a huge king crab, a gigantic egg yolk lobster, pea Shoots with gogi berries, crab Fried rice, dessert and a bottle of white wine. A great deal for what you're getting! Quality of the food was top notch. Execution was well. The shark fin was braised with whole fin intact. The abalone was tender. The pea shoots that the abalone sat on were a bit overdone but nevertheless flavorful. They bring the crab and lobster over in a crate to show you. Crab weighed in at about 6 pounds. Lobster weighed in about 5 pounds. The crab was served whole boiled with a garlic sauce. The restaurant does a good job with supplying plastic gloves for patrons to eat which is a great idea. They also give you scissors to cut the crab making eating crabs relatively enjoy a me and painless. The king crab that we got was juicy and full of meat! Meat was sweet and full of natural flavor. The lobster came in the form of a tower. Very lightly breaded with egg yolk and flour, it was light enough to eat many and keep eating without feeling full. It wasn't greasy at all. We just kept eating and eating. The lobster meat was juicy and sweet as well. The pea shoots with gogi berries was much better than the first pea shoots that came with the abalone. This was done just right and super fresh. The fried rice contained chunks of crab meat and some roe. Yummo.   Service was it was typical understaffed Chinese restaurant vibes. You have to flag them down to order. But overall, service was ok. They didn't yell or cop attitude which is a WIN IMHO.   I would def come back again but bring a bigger group so that we can eat more!   Also they only accept cash so be prepared!"}
{"text":"Love the food. This place is like red lobster when I was a kid, we'd only go for speical occasions. Except, the food is amazing!.. and Chinese. So the only similarity is the seafood and the price.   The only negative part about this restaurant is seeing all the fish tanks crammed with crab, lobster and fish. They can't be happy with no where to move and having to watch their friends be eaten in front of them! But they taste so good."}
{"text":"Food was okay, the load was pretty heavy. However, some parts of the lobster was very BITTER, when I asked the waitress they purposely ignored my question and walked elsewhere... The food was fast on though."}
{"text":"This place was decent until we came back and they served us raw lobster claws. They gave us the most lame excuse \" because it's a different type of meat of the lobster they cook differently\" I told them they specialize in this type of seafood regardless which part of the lobster it is.we spending a lot of money here I expected better service."}
{"text":"Anyone visiting Toronto must make an effort to dine here. As you enter the majestic dining room, you are surrounded with hundreds of aquariums filled with giant lobsters and king crab waiting to be picked. Lobsters are priced at $20/lb for a minimum 5 lb lobster or the table d'hôte menu which is what we took for 9 people requires purchasing a minimum 25 lbs of lobster charged at $16/lb, comes with 2 sides and a bottle of wine, a great deal. Lobsters are brought and showcased at your table with weight stickers to validate weight then off they go to the butcher block. Lightly dusted with a cayenne, garlic powder and deep fried, they return to your table chopped up on a death defying tall tower. Wow what an experience! Flavourful, moist and tender. 10% service added to your invoice. A great group event, can't wait to return someday."}
{"text":"I came here with my family. We were a group of 10. The seafood is very fresh and beautifully presented. We ordered a set meal which included soup, lobster, crab, oysters, dessert, chicken, sweet & sour pork, dessert for $599. This was more than enough to feed the table. In fact, we could not finish everything and had to take about 5 boxes of takeout home. The staff brings the lobster out before they cook it so you know exactly what you're getting and the exact weight.   The food tasted great but after I got home, my stomach was very upset. My sister had the same thing."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents. Found out this restaurants serves shark fins. As someone of Chinese heritage, shark fins should be banned from restaurant menus. Please do NOT support this restaurant."}
{"text":"Taking photos with crab and lobster is very rushed because the staff rushes you. However, the food was very good but the service wasn't so great. They only came over to drop off the food and the space in the restaurant is very tight and squishy. It is very pricey to eat here and I recommend that you book reservations because it is always full at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came with a group of 8 friends for lunch and we decided to get the 20 pound lobster mountain combo which costs $268 and includes dried scallop congee, poach snow peas with goji berries and almond soup.  We also added fried E-Fu noodles ($9.99) and lobster roe fried rice ($15).  The congee didn't have much flavour but everything else was good. The best thing was of course the lobster mountain.    This was the second time at this location and both times have been good experiences.  Next time I'd probably ask for 3 lobsters that are around 6.5 pounds each because the 13.5 pound lobster we got was more chewy and wasn't fully cooked.  This is definitely a place I'd visit at least once a year as a special treat."}
{"text":"Look no further, If you love lobster and crab this is the place to visit!!  Making a reservation in advance is highly recommended and note that this business establishment is cash only or (Canadia) debit cards only (US debit cards not allowed).  Not sure if there was an ATM machine at the restaurant but come with enough cash or have a Canadian debit card.  I spent about 120 Canadian per person and based in some reviews that appears to be the amount you might expect to spend per person.    The pricing, well, I honestly think it's expensive.  But you do get what you pay for here.  I thought that the lobster and crab was made perfectly and this was definitely the best seafood experience of my whole entire life.  From beginning to end, it was just amazing.  You come in and you're greeted with people already dining and the presentation of each dish is just phenomenal. Everything is presented and stacked so nicely.  There's walls of lobsters and crabs surrounding you and as you wait you can just smell delicious cookef lobster and crab aroma.  That alone is like an appetizer just for you or nose.  After ordering, they bring out the lobster and crab for a photo op.  The crab was made into different dishes and was fried and another dish was streamed to perfection.  The lobster was equally amazing. Definitely don't get everything fried even if you love fried food (I do). There's enough fried goodness with the lobster and crab legs.    I'll be sure to visit the next time I'm in town.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"An amazing food experience. I had the pleasure of coming here with my co-workers.   Service was great! Food was excellent! Price was worth it!!  Come with a group and you'll have an amazing time"}
{"text":"All the pictures the people prior to this review posted are completely accurate. This place makes amazing lobster and crab a few different way. When ordering from their set menus, be prepared for large portions when they say 4 people on the menu they mean it feeds 6 or 7.  They will also charge for the overage of weight of the seafood if its heavier then stated on the menu so watch out for that.  Other then those pointers, this place is fantastic. very delicious. seafood lovers dream!"}
{"text":"My family usually goes downtown for lobster, however, we went during Mother's Day and let me tell you for the price it's worth for the experience. They let you see your lobster or crab, whichever you get. Then you can even take photos and touch it. We paid around $180 including tip? This is for 3-4 people dinner. My mom and dad enjoyed their time their and will be coming back every year for Mother's Day!"}
{"text":"No more King Crab now. We just went last Tues to their new location for 8pm dinner. We still had to wait 1hr for table even though we booked reservations. They seem pretty sloppy & disorganized. Our combo costed close to $800 with tax & tips included for 10 people without King crab included! Sweet & sour pork had lots of fat and not that great. Had 15 lbs lobster. There was 10 of us. Took a while to get a table & too busy even for dinner on weekdays. Food & service was not as good as before. Would not come back again. They removed all the King crabs from all combos on menu so food is not the same without King Crab. Service was slow & not that great for the big bill that we paid...  We just went last week & service sucks now & slow. They don't even clear table much like before. I had to go grab new plates ourselves. Slow service, no more King Crab. Would not come back esp since my bill was $800 for mediocre service"}
{"text":"yes, a great place but super duper expensive.  huge line ups.  avoid the weekends.  really really crowded.  neat thing is that the patio is being used as an additional space for diners.  it's heated in the winter time and it's very romantic like that at night with the candles they got lit.  they got one of them huge gas lights like they got at those outdoors cafe places.  warm and cozy.  i highly recommend the sweet and sour pork and the more expensive variety of lobster.  don't get the lower grade.  you can taste the difference.  book your table ahead of time!!!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to be taken here for my birthday a few weeks ago.   Make sure you make reservations! We made reservations for 8pm and when we got there, there was a HUGE HUGE crowd by the door. It took me 3 minutes just to try and push my way through this crowd. I was very thankful we made reservations.   The turnover rate (as for most Chinese places) is pretty good though, I'd say 30 minutes into our dinner, the crowd was almost all gone.   We were only a party of 4 so we opted not to go with a combo. (Also, one member of our party is quite a picky eater and doesn't normally go for seafood). We ordered the Hong Kong style lobster, sirloin beef with black pepper sauce, lobster roe fried rice and garlic baby pea shoots.  Hong Kong Style Lobster - This was delicious. We told the waitress we wanted 4lbs of lobster for this. She came back with 2 giant 2lbs lobsters. We were really surprised and excited that she opted to give us 2 x 2lbs instead of 1 x 4lbs. Two heads, two tails, 4 claws.. need I explain more? The presentation on this dish was pretty amazing. We almost didn't want to touch it, if it weren't for our stomachs growling at us to destroy this thing. It's covered in deep fried garlic and deep fried little fishies. And of course, if you've read others reviews here, this is a must have when coming here. It's what they are famous for and for good reason.  Sirloin Beff with Black Pepper Sauce - We ordered this dish because of the non-seafood eater of the group. This was surprisingly very good. I don't think I was expecting too much from this but the beef was very tender and cooked nicely and the sauce was nice also. Not too peppery. The only drawback is it already came with garlic baby pea shoots and we didn't know so we ordered another plate of that.. but it was good also :)  Lobster Roe Fried Rice - This wasn't as great as so many people here raved about. But it was still pretty good. I guess my standards were set a little too high. The roe was deep fried first which I think compromised the flavour a bit. Other than that, this fried rice was pretty standard.   Even though there were only 4 of us, and one didn't even really eat seafood, we still managed to destroy the whole meal, having no leftovers in the end. That says something about the food."}
{"text":"Best lobster in town. We ordered Hong Kong style which was amazing. An order of food for 4 people is actually enough for 6. Good quality see food."}
{"text":"The lobster tower is the definite go-to. We were expecting it to be rubber-y because of how much lobster there was. But credit to the kitchen: it's cooked really well and has good flavour (we got Hong Kong style). The rest of the food (we also tried crab and side veggie and noodle dishes) are just ok.  Also, definitely reserve beforehand (it's packed most of the time) and make sure to have some confirmation (they kept insisting we didn't have a table booked until I showed the confirmation receipt). Despite the hassle though, the lobster tower was worth it."}
{"text":"They will weight the lobster or crab in front of your face and let your know how much it cost :) very honest seafood restaurant i love their service and the food is amazing"}
{"text":"I've been to the two previous incarnations of Fishman Lobster Clubhouse and they have really stepped it up with each move. This location is large and looks very upscale, even compared to the last location. The exterior, however, looks like the building is condemned. It's very run down, although I could see signs of ongoing work to improve it. On the bright side, it looks like they finally have adequate parking. Yay!  To the delight of my dining companions, I'm allergic to lobster, which means more for them. I came here for the beef and have enjoyed the King Crab and Dungeness Crab in the past.  We ordered a combo with Hong Kong Style Lobster, Lobster Roe Fried Rice, and Snow Peas Tips with Goji Berries. For me, we ordered the Diced Beef with Garlic.  As is the norm, the live lobster was weighed and brought to the table before it was cooked. It's priced by weight, which determines the final price of the combo. Ours was a little over 4lbs. It's also a popular photo op for diners.  The food started arriving shortly after, presenting an even more popular photo opportunity, especially the lobster mountain. This is the first place I've seen prepare the lobster this way (years ago) and many other places have starting doing it but this presentation still looks the best.  The beef was very tender, with lots of crispy garlic flakes. Delicious! My companions, two ladies, devoured the lobster and declared that is was also delicious. We ate most of the veggies (it was a large serving) and they took home most of the fried rice.  I have to mention, the Hong Kong Style lobster, is deep fried and covered with crispy garlic flakes and crispy anchovies, in this case, tiny dried fish. This alone is so delicious that I take my chances, sprinkling some of this over my rice and other dishes. So good!  This is the best incarnation of this restaurant so far. Even the service has improved, although it was never bad. They still accept only cash or debit so plan your visit accordingly because the bill can add up quickly, especially if you eat with your eyes first."}
{"text":"Great Food!  Decent prices.  I loved the food, the lobster and crab was very fresh."}
{"text":"Excellent place for lobster and crab! Relatively expensive, but worth it for a special occasion. Great food, attentive service and interesting decor (place is big and can get little noisy) make it an unforgettable experience."}
{"text":"Where to start this place is very expensive if you have a lot of money to spend on seafood this might be the best place in town. Most of the items on the menu are fried therefore you feel full very full fast to do to the oiliness of the food. This place will provide you a quick view of the lobster snow crab or seafood they are ordering before making it. Therefore here is your opportunity to take a picture of the actual item, meaning you can actually hold it . Interesting they provide to clear gloves at your table to use with eating seafood. Keep in mind there is A lot of MSG in the food so drink lots and lots of water. But I personally feel that, the seafood is either boiled or steaming it taste better while frying the seafood loses  some of the true taste.  A quick note just want to make a reservation before heading there,  because good luck you will not get a table"}
{"text":"Well known for the Hong Kong style lobster, Fishman Lobster Clubhouse has one of the most unique lobster restaurants in the city. If you are feeling adventurous, the towering pile of lobster chunks will satisfy both your appetite and eyes - for it is quite something to look at. I especially love the fact that the chunks are mostly free from the shell. It makes it easier to enjoy. Always looking forward to go back for more lobsters."}
{"text":"We called four hours ahead to make RSVP for the same day at 7pm. Surprisingly they had openings! We got there around 6:30 and it was still pretty empty. Once ordered and waited for the food to come, eventually the whole place filled up very fast! There was king crabs lining the wall! It was my first time seeing anything like this. The waiter picked the crab and lobster and brought it to the table for us to see and take pictures with (which is awesome). The pictures attached with a set of dinner for 3-4. Missing the black chicken soup and snow pea pod tips. This is also the first restaurant I've been to that serves black chicken soup.  Food: 5 stars   The snow pea pod tips took the longest to come out. Even tables around us who came later got their food sooner than we did. Once I asked about it, the waiter was very polite and checked up on it, and came back to let me know that it's on its way. However when we were done, it probably took them 15 mins or more to give us the check.  Service: 4 stars   One thing I did not like about this was that even though we selected a \"set dinner,\" the price can be different depending on how much your lobster or crab weighs. The waiter did not tell us that they do this so when we got the check, it was $100 more what the \"set dinner\" price is. Not exactly sure how this works but is tricky for people who did not expect this."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Crab or Lobster feast you can get anywhere on the East Coast. I, myself, is from Boston, which is famous for their seafood and this place beats it hands down. The way they cook the lobster or crab here, you can never find this style cooked anywhere else. I would definitely recommend getting one of the meal combos though, as ordering a single crab or lobster is definitely not worth it.   Pros:  + Delicious with cooking styles not found anywhere else. Beats anywhere on the East Coast by far!  + Very good meal combos with huge selections.  + There is a lot of parking. Even with the restaurant packed, the parking lot still accomodates everyone.  + Lobsters/Crabs are cracked prior to frying/cooking. You would not need a shell cracker to eat these. Just find the seam that they cracked it and then just split them apart. Very easy to eat.  + Huge portions! We had 8 people and we ordered the 8 person meal and we were unable to finish it. If you have a huge appetite go for it. Otherwise, divide the amount of people it feeds by around half and order that. So if you have 8 people, order the 4 person meal. If you have 12 people, order the 8 person meal.   Cons:  - RESERVATION. You will DEFINITELY need to make a reservation at least a week ahead of time. If you just walk-in, there is a high chance you will not be able to get seated. I've heard of people not being able to get a seat even making a reservation 2 weeks ahead.  - EXPENSIVE. The meals will cost you around $100+ per person, depending on how big your stomach is and which meal you order.  - Your crab will DEFINITELY be over by a pound or more. There has not been a time that they did not charge us an additional $45 for an extra pound for the crab. How is it that the crab is over by a pound EVERY time we go there? Who the heck knows. Still worth it though.  Other than that, this is definitely a place to try. Even if it's only one time. Is it a tourist trap? Sure. Is it expensive? Sure. Would you feel disgusted with yourself after eating all this crab and lobster? Hell yeah. But in the end, you tried it and it was freaking delicious. You will want to come back again. Guaranteed."}
{"text":"Excellent place to have lobster!   This is the new location on Finch and Kennedy, much bigger than the old location. Although we came on the Monday after the ice storm, it was still 90% full, which goes to show how popular it is.  The food was fresh and tasty. We were a party of 8, but based on experience, we ordered the 6-people set and added a garlic beef; It was enough food for everyone. The beef was done just right without being tough, and the crispiness of the beef gave a good flavorful texture to eat bite. Although this is more of a seafood restaurant, their beef and chicken dishes (which we tried last time) are also delicious. The highlight had to be the lobster dishes though, as the restaurant name suggests. Whether they were steamed or fried, the lobster meat was sweet and tender, and seasoned well.  Anytime I crave lobster, this is the place I'll go!"}
{"text":"Wait, so for $17/lb you can get a tower of lobster? And for $10 more you can get thousands of fried little fishies and garlic to eat it with? Yes.  Definitely read the special set menus as there are deals which makes the lobster cheaper. Came with a couple friends and had a set menu with a 5.5lb lobster and paid the extra $34 to make it 7.5lbs. Super fun and delicious. Coming back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant for big lobster.  We love the lobster mountain here.  Fisherman Club only serves live seafood, no matter which set menu and which size of the lobster that you order.  The waiter will bring the moving lobster to you for approval prior to cooking it.  They can cook a lobster in many ways, but they charge a fee if you request the spicy stir fried style (unless the set menu already calls for this style).  The steamed sea bass included the 3-4 people set menu is about 1 lb and is small for 3-4 people.    I like the big lobster here over the one at Omei, because the lobster here can be as small as 4 lb.  This is a more reasonable size for a small family dinner.    Just a note that Fisherman carries lobster from slightly over 1 lb to over 9 lbs.  If the set menu calls for a certain size lobster, and they show you a bigger lobster and you agree to it, they will charge you for the extra weight at $17/lb.  If you don't like the bigger lobster they bring out, you should ask them to get another one; you just have to specify the weight you prefer.  More often, you will end up with a lobster slightly bigger than the weight as specified in the menu, though.  Cash only.  Reservation is highly recommended even for weekdays."}
{"text":"Best crab and lobster dinner I've ever experienced.  The flavors are amazing. If you will be in town make sure u bring a lot of cash and make a reservation before going. My best friend made sure we got the table first before booking the hotel"}
{"text":"The portions are big. We ordered 'E' from menu. \"E\" is meant for 4 people, We had 6 people, and we had 5 boxes of left over to take home.   I really like the way they cut the lobster and crab legs, claws. They are all open face, so you need to crack the shell. Every piece has meat exposed and eat off the shell.   This place is so efficiently run, unlike other Chinese restaurants which have over 200+ items on their menus. This place has very few variety so that kitchen don't have prepare so many ingredients.   Our server changed our plates 4 times. Will visit again.   If you visit Toronto, call ahead and make reservation. If you have out of town visitors, take them there."}
{"text":"Yay I'm so happy to celebrate my 200th review on Yelp!!!  Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant is a well-known seafood restaurant within the Asian-Canadian community as they are known for as the first restaurant to introduce the majestic lobster mountain, and they remain to be one of the best. I shared a table with 8 other people, and we were determined to get our hands on the lobster mountain. And yes, reservation is a must at this restaurant, especially during the weekend.   Environment: The restaurant is located at the Steeles/Silver Star intersection, which also has quite a few Chinese restaurants nearby. The parking is free and there is ample of space to accommodate the large traffic to the nearby restaurants.  The restaurant itself is fairly big and has lots of big tables to accommodate big groups and for special buy-out events. The dining space is surrounded by lobster and crab tanks, which allows you to see how big some of their offerings are and they are definitely all fresh.   Food: They have a lot of combo options available that caters to different group sizes and also the type of seafood. Generally speaking, the combo is a much better deal than ordering the seafood separately by weight. We got the B4 combo for $270, which comes with a 20lb lobster mountain, a bean stalk with goji berry dish, plain white congee, and almond milk dessert. We also ordered a lobster roe fried rice ($10 with the combo) and E-Fu noodle ($16) on the side.   Before they prepared for our lobster dish, they brought the live lobsters to our table to ensure that we are satisfied with the size and quality, and yes, also for photo-opp purposes :P For our 20lb lobster mountain, we got 2 lobsters: one is 8lb and the other is 12lb. Our friends on the other table also ordered the same dish as us and they got 3 lobsters even in size. Our 12lb lobster was gorgeous and essentially everybody at our table was taking turns holding it up and taking pictures with it. Its claw was literally bigger than my face!! Our lobsters were slightly heavier than the intended 20lb combined, so they charged us some extra money following their regular price/pound rate, so yeah, we did get up-sell by a little bit.  The lobster mountain that we finally got was massive that it was approximately 40cm tall and looked exactly like the pictures I've seen only. I really liked its flavor and especially the tiny deep fried fish that were sprinkled all around the lobster mountain. The fish was slightly spicy but it would pair well with congee and fried rice, so we packed all the leftovers home. The meat of the lobster was too stiff for me due to its size, so I think the other table with 3 smaller lobsters had better texture of meats.  The other dishes that we got weren't very good and definitely didn't deserve the price. We were totally let down by the lobster roe fried rice and the noodle, because there were barely any meats in both of the dishes and the flavour wasn't that good. On top of that, for $16 regularly, it was definitely too expensive. Heck, even the plain white congee was supposedly $8 if you order separately. Just stick with their famous seafood dishes and you're good to go.  We ended up paying $41 per person for the 9 of us, which was still a pretty good deal considering how much lobster we were getting.   Service: We had some argument with the staff regarding how they were using the parts of our lobster. We had specifically requested that we would like to keep the lobster roe and brains from our fresh lobster and the lobster roe used in the fried rice was supposed to come from some other lobster. Even though our server wrote it down, the kitchen didn't follow our request.  When we found it, the server came to apologize and sent another dish with just the lobster brain. However, since it was made separately, it didn't have the flavour that was in the lobster mountain. Later on, the management came over and their attitude was horrible, even though it was clearly their fault for not following our request. On top of that, they were essentially scamming out of the other customers who didn't specifically requested to keep their lobster roe and brains, so they could reuse it on the fried rice.  I'm deducting one star due to this incident, but the meal itself was great."}
{"text":"This place is must try experience for people who love to eat and be wowed by an amazing food presentation. We were greeted by wonderful gigantic fish and a wall of giant crabs.  The menu is full of wonderful choices for any size of groups. Although a little pricey, what can you expect from seafood restaurant. They are constantly bringing out food from the kitchen that can make your stomach growl while waiting.  The food is just wonderful, seasoned with butter and fried garlic the crabs and lobster were just a mouth watering, melting and deliciousness that we did not expect. It was plenty and overwhelming! After a while, the food tasted the same since it was so much!  It's a must try experience and one I definitely recommended. The price can be an issue for many people, but bring a big group and it can be manageable. So eat on folks!"}
{"text":"Came here for Christmas lunch. Lots of great options for food, huge portions, and amazing flavors. We had the set menu of 5 lobsters which comes with a bottle of white wine, rice, soup, veggies and dessert. We couldn't finish all of it and the total came up to ~$550. They automatically add on 10% for tip to make it easy. The service is fast and easy and would come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Sunday night with my parents we ordered a 6 to 8 lb lobster - it was covered in a light batter and was fried, seasoned with anchovies, scallions, garlic, salt, chili peppers and was well presented. We also had choy sum and a green bass. The best feature is the lobster and crab - there are few places in the world  where a 12 lb crustacean can be cooked, as well as be palatable and this is one of the them.  The restaurant is a bit small and very popular. Reservations are checked 1 hour prior to your arrival due to popularity of the restaurant. It's in the northeast part of Scarborough and definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Service was one of the worst I've ever experienced no reason to sit at a table for 45 mins before my order was even taken finally found someone to take my order and he forgot to put it in claimed he couldn't find a 6lb lobster for me ended up with a 7 lb didn't ask for a 6lb one he just lied because he forgot to put in my order people that came in after me was eating and paying for their dinner before I even had any food when my lobster finally came it was delicious and the house soup was excellent but the lobster roe fried rice and snow pod pea leaves was ok."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Good service and fast. The price is so reasonable compared to Chicago. Heard abt this restaurant when I was on my trip in china from relatives that's visited, told me it's a \"must go\" place. I went and I don't regret it. I've already referred to my friends and other family members. So cheap for so much food. My husband and I order a \"dinner for 4\" $288, even tho it was just the two of us. Came with a 6 lb king crab, 4 lb lobster, fried rice, soup, veggie dish and dessert. The crab was cooked into 3 dishes and lobster 1 dish. We couldn't finish. Took the leftovers back to hotel and ate it again later that night. Bill came to be $370 Canadian dollars including tips.   F.Y.I - if ur visitors like us... be sure to bring either BMO Harris bank debit card or credit or Canadian cash. We had chase bank credit and debit, they couldn't take it. But so lucky we had just enough cash to cover it. Only had $10 left after paying the bill... lol... Close one..."}
{"text":"My Order: Lobster Combo with soup, lobster, rice.   Pros  + Ambiance: Wall to wall fish tanks  + Service: they show you the lobster in all its freshness before they cook it!  + Parking   Cons  - RSVP: Plan at least 2 days in advance, especially if you have a bigger party. I came in a group of 5 and we got a 8pm reservation on Sunday. If not, you're gonna have a bad time."}
{"text":"The food tasted really good but the service was horrible. it took forever for the server to come to our table, and we had to repeatedly ask for things."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. We came here for lunch and then had to come back for dinner.   The best thing to get is the bifengtang flavor. It is their specialty and makes for a nice garlicky flavor with a little heat.   I personally like the lobster more, but the crab is the one to get. It is miles better than any crab I've ever eaten. The lobster is also the best, but it is not miles better like the crab.   The weakest part are the sides. Those kind of are bland, large portion and generally are a waste of stomach space.   Service is fast. You order and they show you a live sea creature and bring it cooked within 20 minutes.   If you like lobster/crab this is a must place to go. Definitely make reservations or you'll wait till 10pm."}
{"text":"My friends and i have always been a big fan of this place until our last visit a day ago. They changed their recipe on HK style lobster. Instead of using little anchovies (the signature of the dish)they replaced it with potato french fries. This completely ruined their famous signature style! In speaking to the staff, apparently we are not the only customers who feel this way."}
{"text":"I think this is a great restaurant ( beside trying so hard to up selling their set menu as usual.^^;)  Quality of food was far beyond my expectation.  As I mentioned above, beside the fact that they were trying to sell you on a high priced family menu, I was completely satisfied with foods and service.  We ended up ordering set menu for 3. Because we visited the restaurant for an occasion, (my GF and her cousin were having birthday at the similar time frame.. did not want to make a scene..)  1. Lobster - I was thinking about having their famous dried garlic lobsters but GF wanted to have something with sauce - yes, she is not really a sea food lover - settled with Maggi sauce. Result? She was busy digging into a huge platter of the lobster! Later I was told she had the best lobster in her lifetime. What else should I hoped for? ^^ Crunch, Tangy meat of lobster went really well with sweet, soy-like taste of the sauce and I seriously thought about ordering a bowl of rice to finish left over- sauce!!! did not want to waste a drop.  2. Flounder - I always thought a FRESH FISH is a must ingredient of a perfect  dish. skins were little soft and greasy and the meat under neath were well cooked and tasty. sometimes, if a fish stayed too long in the fish tank without food, its meat loses the freshness and texture... There was none of that in this dish. it was firm and had full of fresh seafood aroma ( which I can sense but hard to explain... I think you, readers can understand what I'm trying to express..)     , made great taste with their sweet-soy like sauce and chopped scallions on the top. some may complain that the sauce  should have stronger taste... but it was perfect for me.  3, Poached 'Choi Sum' in seafood broth topped with BC clams & Tobiko - OK............ I have to warn you...........It is not for everyone. ^^  Choi Sum - or Chinese Flowering Cabbage were not mushy.. it was cooked almost like al dente -  soft outside and little crunch inside.    Clam meat - did not have bad odor, again they were fresh and tasty. Broth - simple... just right amount of flavor.......  BUT~!! if you can't stand THE SMELL from various seafood,do not order this... You will regret ordering it for sure.( I was satisfied with it, My GF did not like it much..........)  4.Fried rice noodle with beef and veg - IF you taste each ingredients separately they were good. As a whole dish?I would not say it was bad.. but the soup base on the bottom did not go well with sauce on the rice and beef.    5. Black sesame soup - rich and not overly sweet. so you can actually feel the aroma and taste little bitterness from it. this dessert  could calm me down after having a huge meal.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  some may say it is a pricy restaurant for Chinese food but, hey....we are talking about lobsters and seafood, nothing is cheap in toronto when it comes to it, no? I rather come to this restaurant than some others - which I won't reveal the name - for a special occasion and lobster + fish.  Overall, I would give 5 stars but Their effort(or pushing) for the high priced set menu made me to drop a star."}
{"text":"Food was great and worth the price.  We ordered a set dinner which had Vancouver crab, 2 lobsters total 9lbs cooked 2 ways, \"shark fin\" soup, abalone w/ vegetables, steamed fish, another dish of vegetables and dessert.    They didn't have the fish that was in our set dinner and tried to upsell us to a more expensive fish, we just told them no and to give us another fish.  They didn't have 2 lobsters that totalled 9lbs, so they gave us 3 lobsters.  They bring the lobsters/crab to your table to show you what you're getting, almost everyone in the restaurant were taking pictures of their lobsters/crabs when they were brought out.  The food came out very fast.  Everything except the dessert came out within 20-30 minutes.  We almost had no room on the table for everything, luckily we finished our soup just as everything was coming out.  Great servers, very polite and friendly.  They changed our plates frequently.  A server saw us trying to separate the fish from the bone and quickly came over to ask us if we wanted her to do it.  We asked her to, and she apologised that it wasn't done when it was brought it out.  Our total for 5 people after tax and 10% tip which is already added on came up to almost $500.  Would have given it 5 stars, but our only issue is with the owner/manager (the guy who's not in a uniform).  Once we got the bill, he comes over to collect.  We told him that we weren't ready yet as we were still counting the money.  So he stands there waiting.  When we hand him the money, he starts counting it in front of us.  Once he's satisfied that it's all there, he just walks away without saying anything.  Most places they would at least say thank you."}
{"text":"For our end of the year get together dinner, a group of us (10) made a reservation for Dec 30th for 8:30 p.m.  When we arrived the restaurant was full and we were promptly seated near the back surrounded by large tanks full of crabs, lobsters and eels.    One person from our group was a \"regular\" here so he ordered for the table and the food started rolling out pretty promptly.    The silky chicken soup was flavourful start to our meal but I'd say it was not the best I've had.  Snow peas with gojiberries follwed and the gojiberries were a little too sweet for my liking as well.  I've cooked with gojiberries before and I must say this was the first time I've tasted rehydrated gojiberries that tasted this sweet.    The deep fried oysters in dark/sticky soy was yummy and we were properly primed for our main feast of king crab and lobster.  We opted for a 10 lbs lobster and a 8 lb king crab for 10 of us and I think the guys in our group could have probably gobbled another 5 lbs of either king crab or lobster no problem.    The king crab leg towers and the lobster towers were formidable mountains of fried seafood goodness.  Both the crab and the lobsters were fried juicy and seasoned simply with spiced salt and pepper.  We enjoyed the generous topping of fried garlic slivers and tiny fish that topped the seafood towers that provided extra crunch.  The plastic gloves that are stored in a container for the feat was a nice touch but I found that my fingers still got greasy anyways.    The steamed green bass was possibly the highlight of my meal.  The nicely butterflied fish was firm and topped simply with green onion and cilantro.  The say for the fish arrived in a separate wine glass and was poured at the table.  The flavour was mild, fish was firm and a simple dressing with green onion and cilantro really brought out the fish's delicate flavours.  Superb.    There was a fried rice dish that I did not partake in because I was too busy enjoying the food.    It was a nice novelty meal to be had with a good group of friends and the almond milk/porridge they served to end the meal was a perfectly silk sweet ending to the meal.    I can already think of several family members who would be really excited about seeing a huge tower of seafood so I guess I'll be paying them several more visits in the future."}
{"text":"Seriously, what's not to love. Mountains of lobster and crabs at a great price. Better to have a large group but need to make reservations"}
{"text":"This ain't no Red Lobster!  Serious seafood, fresh as it gets and cooked to perfection.  I have been here three times and each time it was great.  They really know how to cook all types of seafood, but the standout is the lobster and crab.  They love stacking their lobster and crabs into little mountains and the presentation is impressive.  They cook seafood juuuuust enough so that it is not rubbery and really makes the most out of the meat.  Other non-seafood dishes here are actually very good too.  Note, when you order, you will see set menu prices for certain amounts of seafood (i.e. 5lbs of lobster).  However, after you order, they will come up to you and say that given the available lobsters in their tanks, they might have to sell you 6lbs of lobsters instead thus the price may be a bit more than you expect.  Anyways, it is good service and good seafood and at the end, it isn't really that expensive given the quality.    Bring cash or debit, no credit card."}
{"text":"I have been to Fishman about 3 times now but this is the first time at this location since they relocated. The food has always been the same but the decor is much improved. Its much larger than the previous location but its still not enough seats to supply the demand. There was still people waiting for seats at 9:30pm and the place closes at 11pm. Reservations is a must and if you think you are going to get a seat just by showing up then think again. You will be turned away and you will have to settle for their old location which is now Lobster King.   Although the place is bigger the tables are so tightly squeezed together its difficult to even walk to get to your tables. The back of the restaurant is displayed with fish tanks where you can potentially see which crab or lobster you will be eating. There were at least 20 huge tanks set up. This place is about the WOW factor. The plates are extra large and the lobster is piled up so high I call it lobster mountain. Every time a new dish is brought out you can't help but stare and once it reaches the table all you see is flashes of light from people snapping pictures.  I usually go with one of their combo meals but this time we ordered what we wanted. Ended up getting the following for 4 people: 5 lb lobster at $16.99 / lb 6 piece oyster with honey sauce $16.95   snow peas fried rice with lobster brains $8.95 (mmmmmm.....braaaains)  Oysters were very large and the sauce was really well done (highly recommended). Lobster brain fried rice was a bit on the small side but there were many large pieces of lobster brains (a good replacement for plain white rice). Lobster is of course a must here. I wanted to get the eel like I normally do but its out of season during winter but the fried eel is also highly recommended at $19.99 / lb.   For the ladies out there I know you don't want to show bad eating habits but this is one place you have to forgo the knife and fork. That's why plastic gloves are provided for eating the lobster/crab with your hands.  Just some fun fact on lobsters - it takes about 15-20 years for a lobster to reach about 3 pounds and some lobster species can live to be over 100 years old. The menu here focuses on 6 lb lobsters so we are eating a creature that could be around 30 to 40 years old. I found this fascinating and though I would share.  Prices are high but worth the experience at least once and you can forget about going back to Red Lobster once you have tried the lobster here. Be expecting to fork out about $40-$50 per person."}
{"text":"This place is totally worth my trip from Michigan to Toronto. This is a big restaurant with good customer service. My favorite is the Hong Kong style lobster combo. You get to pick your own lobster and how much it weights. A you also get additional salad and soup. The only downside is that they only take cash so make sure you bring cash. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone who visits Toronto."}
{"text":"#fishmanlobsterclubhouse decent meal. Worst service ever. With one poor attitude staff that ruined the entire experience. Here is what happened: was eating when the 4th dish came and instead of helping out one other sever actually walked up and accused myself and my guest of not having the decency of helping move dishes. She came back after the manager told her to to apologize and instead of apologizing for her attitude she apologized that we were blind to not see the server bringing our food and walked away. Still can't believed that that actually happened. #donteathere #torontofood #horrorstory #worstserviceever #gastropost #markhamfood"}
{"text":"Overrated. Food is good but too pricey. The combo that my friends and I ordered (we were 8 ppl, server recommended this combo for 6-7 ppl), costed us EACH $50 and we were not even that full. The crab and lobster were cooked very similarly, deep fried with tons of garlic. We couldn't taste the freshness of the seafood, which was a waste. The other dishes were very small in portion. I probably won't go back because there are other places that serve good seafood at a more reasonable price."}
{"text":"i LOVE this place! Been here about 10+ times!!! LoL   I'd love to come here more often but it is quite pricey.  I would highly recommend all the seafood be cooked the Hong Kong Style with those small deep fried fishes and garlic. Even though the combo says it cooks it differently just let them know that you want ALL of them HK style...you won't regret it.   Another, order the fried oysters. If you love it, order it. It's sooo damn delious.  Take lots of pics 'cuz it's twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram....worthy!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great. But beware of waiters trying to bully you into ordering more than you need.(though this is evident in a lot of chinese restaurants so not singling them out) The lobster mountain is a definite must if you come here. I recommend going here for lunch instead of Dinner if you want to save a few bucks and don't mind eating big lobster Lunch.  Great food overall. Kids will enjoy looking at all the fish tanks surrounding the dinning area. Good for groups of 6+"}
{"text":"Im a lobster lover and this is a great place to eat lobster! very tasty! However, it's also expensive so we only got to come here once a while"}
{"text":"What an experience. I was part of a group of 12 that ordered a 27lb lobster tower. This was part of a combo which included pork bone soup, lobster roe fried rice, a veggie dish (cannot remember the name) and finished off with some cashew pudding. The lobster was amazing deep fried goodness. This is truly glutton for punishment and can only be had every so often."}
{"text":"Best Jumbo lobster Hong Kong style. Make sure bring your cash. Restaurant isn't accept credit card"}
{"text":"This place is not a restaurant but a production of seafood tasting.  You walk into the restaurant, all you see are fish tanks surrounding all four walls filled with king crabs and lobsters.  The restaurant is packed with people, and on every table are towers of king crabs and lobsters.  This place only serves king crabs and lobsters.  How many times have I said: king crabs and lobsters?  They offer a variety of set menus for party of two to 10, price ranging from $89 to $899.  We decided on Menu E, which offers 6 lbs. of king crab and 4.5 lbs. of lobster for $288 CAD, which supposed to feed party of 4.  Our waiter came to show us our crab and lobster and told us the price differential since our king crab is 7.5 lbs. instead of 6.  I guess it makes sense since not every crab is weighted the same, but to give us 1.5 lbs. more than we asked for and to pay an additional $69 over the menu price is a little surprising to me, however, I was determined to eat king crab that night, so I went for it.  Less than 15 minutes later, our food came out.  I was shocked, the restaurant was packed, how can they cook it so quickly?  That's why I called this place, a production house, there's probably an assembly line in the kitchen.   Our king crab was cooked in 3 ways; 1) deep fried with garlic, 2) steamed with salted eggs, and 3) crab egg roe stirred fried rice.  The lobster was deep fried with garlic and chili pepper.  The food was delicious, they worked out the ingredients and cooking methods to the tee.  Absolutely amazing experience!  I wish I can have this every day.  The portions were huge, we couldn't finish the food, all the seasoning and sauce soaked overnight, which made the leftovers taste even better.  This was a life time experience for me since we don't get king crabs in our city.  Must try!"}
{"text":"dingy dingy dingy, I wouldn't have in a million years come here; if it wasn't for the fact that this place was suggested to us by DT auntie and uncle.  This place is in a pokey old plaza that doesn't have enough parking, and is crowded beyond belief, but this place is pretty crazy on a weekend night, not to mention you can't get a reservation here on the weekends, unles you book at least a week in advance.  Unquestionably the seafood is good, and the fact that their lobsters sizes are insane.... and they do extremely brisk business.  I doubt I'll come back here again, despite the lobster roe fried rice, the huge lobster, abalone etc.   I thought the abalone was a miss, but their lobster, chickend and chow choi are pretty good.   The pricing is pretty fair, but omg... the parking is crazy and I though Magic Wok was bad... until the restaurant upgrades to a better parking lot. I'm going to take a pass.   I reccomend you make reservations and come here with a group of people, otherwise you wouldn't be able to finish."}
{"text":"Great place for special occasions. Their main lobster mountain is impressive, but I never thought my taste buds would ever get tired of eating lobster, but it did. Mix it up with some  lobster with maggie sauce, and dont buy in to the biggest lobster they have. The smaller ones taste better. The food comes out in a random order and lunch seems to have better service. Its pricey here and they add the tip to the bill on top of tax. Dinner for two can easily be $300+."}
{"text":"After coming to this place twice, my tips: - do get a set menu that can feed 2-3 people LESS than the actual number of people in your party. Eg if you have 6 people, get the 3 or 4 people set.  - do ask for some items to be pan fried or boiled as opposed to deep fried. Eg don't get both lobster and crab deep fried. I know the presentation is nice but it becomes too much to eat. It's nice to have one fried and one boiled or stir fried so change it up a bit.  Both times I came here, we had way too much food and we barely made a dent in our lobster and our crab. We had boxes and boxes of take home containers.The food is good and the presentation does score points but do order just enough so you don't have to eat leftovers for two days in a row. Plus you'll probably save a couple hundred. Group dinners here are expensive and run in the hundreds."}
{"text":"I have heard about this restaurants many times and have seen it on television as well. I was very happy to finally have an opportunity to eat here during a family celebration but I left confused as to what the hype was all about.  Staff: I personally found the staff to be pretty good for the most part, especially for a Chinese establishment. To those who aren't necessarily accustomed to Asian restaurant services, you should probably expect to flag someone down when you want something, rather than having a dedicated waitress checking in on you every so often. It isn't to say all places are like that but I would almost consider that a bit of a norm. The staff seemed to be constantly keeping track of the food on the restaurant tables, and constantly talking into their microphones alerting kitchen staff when they need the next dishes, allowing food to come quickly and in a timely fashion. They were also attentive in changing out plates when they were filling up with seafood shells and bones and kept the teapots filled throughout the dinner. Unfortunately, there was a small incident where a waiter was walking by and spilled water/tea over a couple of our jackets.  Ambience: This is one open space restaurant with all the seafood tanks built inside the walls surrounding the dining area. Glass cases with different bottles of alcohol were on display throughout the restaurant as well. The seats were comfortable but the restaurant is very loud and the tables were located close to one another but not uncomfortably close. Not what I would normally prefer but I'm pretty used to going to restaurants like this.  Food: I think my biggest let down was the food. I always imagined these immaculate dishes of succulent seafood, and they sure did appear that way when they came out: towers of lobsters, giant crab dishes, beautiful spiral display of eel, etc.. If I just ate with my eyes, I'd say that it is a seafood lover's food porn paradise. But each dish just fell flat for me in terms of flavour. We start with a pork bone and chicken soup that was very good but it was reminiscent of soup my family makes at home so for me personally it was not too special. Next we had two giant plates of crab and crab legs (Crab in Hong Kong Style) that seemed to be lacking in seasoning while being drowned in a shallow broth. We had two towers of Deep Fried Lobsters in Fried Garlic that were impressive in appearance but it relied heavily on the deep fried garlic bits for flavour rather than the lobster itself. Other dishes included Steamed Fish, Boiled Chinese Vegetables, and a Steamed Eel dish, which all seemed to have an excess amount of oil. There was also an E-Fu Noodle dish that seemed to be over seasoned, but I will say that the Lobster Roe Fried Rice was amazingly delicious. Dessert was a Chinese Almond/Walnut Sweet Soup which is hard to find but was tasty.  Overall, I'm glad I went for the experience, but I with the heavy price tag I can't see myself going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Recommend for anyone who loves seafood. Always go there for any special celebrations. However it is very pricey"}
{"text":"I came here with my family on Thanksgiving Day. We called to reserve a table the day of. We were told that they were booked until around 8:30pm but that they had the outdoor area open. We booked it for 6:30pm.  It was pretty warm that day so that was good. The outdoor area is basically tables set outside. There's like some plastic draped over the top like a tent. I actually prefer it outside, it was A LOT quieter. Also service was still really good and quick. The only thing I didn't like is that they have scented candles. I'm pretty sensitive to fragrances and I hate smelling anything besides food when I'm eating. We asked the waiter if he could blow it out (there was an empty table behind us with a lit candle) and he moved it further away.  Food was good! We ordered number 10 for the set. They served the soup right away so we were able to drink that first. If this is your first time coming, they do show you the lobster before they cook it. Also as the other reviewers mentioned, they bring out a heavier lobster. Our 7 lb lobster ended up being 9 lb, you do pay for the difference. We had the dry garlic version of the lobster and the Hong Kong style one for the crab. They were both good. The latter is definitely sweet and saltier so it depends on your own preference. The lobster and crab came first, followed by the veggies and fish. You get plastic gloves for eating. We finished up with sesame soup for dessert. This is a good place to come on occasion if you're craving lobster. Service was also good because our plates were frequently changed. Bill was around $400 total for 5-6 people so definitely pricey."}
{"text":"OMG Yum!  The key to being here is to come with a big crowd of people because the amount of lobster you eat will be INSANE.  I've only ever gone once but I went hungry and it was so worth it.  The seasoning on the lobster was so good and the lobster was just oh so yummy.    They show you your lobster prior to cooking - a bit gruesome but if you were part of a PETA alliance, you'd probably not be here :)."}
{"text":"Great portion but it's a little pricey. They have so many choices to cook the lobster and kingcrab. Definitely a must-go place!!!"}
{"text":"I tried king crab and lobster mountain combo which is $599 for 7-8 people (but actually good enough for 10 ppl). Both king crab and lobster was overweight so extra $$$ needed to be added to the original price. The steamed king crab was so fresh and you could taste the sweet taste! Lobster mountain was also awesome!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place if you're looking for delicious, good quality seafood at a reasonable price. Tip: make a reservation before as this restaurant is busy! On a cold Saturday, we came here for lunch and ordered the combo for 4 people.   The combo consists of snow pea leaves with goji berries, lobster roe fried rice, chicken soup, and of course the star of the meal - Hong Kong style lobster! The lobster itself is fried along with little crispy fishes, topped with shredded lettuce. I like to have the snow pea leaves with the lobster as it can be quite heavy. If you're a roe person, you'll appreciate the fried rice here as the portions are generous. At the end of the meal, they usually serve red bean dessert soup for dessert. All this food came up to a bill that was around $130, which isn't a bad price as we still had plenty of leftovers for dinner!    However, after several visits, I'd recommend getting the king crab rather than the lobster here, solely because the sweetness of the crab is a great contrast to the spice and oiliness.   All in all, a solid restaurant if you're looking for Hong Kong style seafood!"}
{"text":"Ok so the bill was over $1600 but it was for twenty four people. Food was amazing and so was the whole spectacle of the thing.  It's a once in a lifetime experience and you should go if you're in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"TLDR; food was great but waitress dropped an entire fish dish on our feet. Sauce spilled and sharp plate shards everywhere. So we pay the bill and also pay the tip, because we understand things like this happen. But to top it off, the waitress demands us for 30 cents because we're 30 cents short. It's already bad enough we have sauce all over our pants and feet, but to ask us for 30 cents? You're joking right?  Decided to try this restaurant out since a lot of people have spoken highly about it. So I came here for my dad's birthday on thanksgiving. After looking through their menu and waiting, we were seated in their \"outside area\". This consisted of a gazebo with tarps surrounding it to keep away the cold. I thought this was pretty outrageous considering it was 15 Celsius outside, but everyone seemed to be okay with it while dining in their jackets. We ordered their 4 person combo along with their famous garlic lobster and Vancouver crab. The food was great but while delivering our fish dish, the waitress dropped the plate on our feet. The sauce splashed everywhere on our pants and feet. It's simple, if you can't hold a dish that heavy - don't be the food runner for that plate."}
{"text":"Yes come here.  Get BOTH the king crab and lobster.  Share among your friends.  I would suggest a party of at least 6 people cause there's plenty to go around.  Mix the garlic stuffing with rice.  Eat some veggies.  Hug it out and go home happy."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh seafood but some pretty poopy service.  Wow factor in the mountain of lobster which you can see in the pictures.  The fried oyster in honey was one of the best dishes I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Make a reservation. Make a reservation.   Fishman lobster clubhouse sets the standard for seafood consumption in Toronto. With different combos dinners you can choose, you won't be short of choice when celebrating a birthday, holiday, business dinner, or date.   Food is fresh and tasty. Fishman lobster clubhouse does not understand the word small, because every dish is monstrous in size.   5/5 would lobster again."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off period....they always keep trying to get u to get the set meals when your looking at the menu, I barely had time to fully look over the menu and they kept pushing us to order, we have in and what a mistake, when they bring the live lobster they tell you that it's overweight of what it's suppose to be so they have to charge more, I asked for them to find me one a little bit lighter but they insist that it's the close weight they could find......  Our food comes and it's a bit too salt a do overcooked for my liking....the lobster claw was still filled with salty sea water which was gross....this place is all about presentation but the quality of food sucks and they keep rushing u so u barely can enjoy dinner  Never coming back here again"}
{"text":"Super lobster mountain (Hong Kong style) at Fishman is still the king of all lobster meals in the city. Underrated part of the feast is the fish flakes on the side - definitely not filler, these could be a good meal in itself with rice and/or veggies on the side.  Other notes: - Fishman moved to a new location which is much bigger, and therefore seems less hectic with more space between tables/diners. - Be sure to check our bill before paying! We made an initial downpayment when we reserved, and they failed to remove this amount from the total bill they gave us at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"We ordered the double large lobster dinner for 4 people ($198) and the meal was delicious. There were eight courses, four of the courses which featured a 11 pound lobster:  1) soup of the day - it was a bit salty, but there was a rich chicken taste to it  2) steamed lobster meat - I thought this was the best course - the lobster was prepared so that it is easy to eat, the sauce included parsley and cilantro, which really brought out the the sweetness of the lobster.   3) poached claw in soup - this dish used chicken essence to infuse the lobster claw. I found it a bit salty, and was surprised the dish was dry and not in a more liquid form. The chicken taste brought out the freshness of the lobster.  4) leg in Hong Kong style - this dish was very interesting - the lobster leg was accompanied by small fried fishies (think the size of goldfish crackers but even smaller) seasoned with garlic. It was very savoury and also had strong umami richness.   5) lobster roe fried rice - the dish was infused with lobster roe which made it very rich, the taste of it was good. However, the appearance of this course was not as appealing as their other previous courses - it looked kind of deflated when the dish came out.  6) poached bass - the waitress recommended that we switched the oil poached bass to a steamed version, and it was a good thing we did! The previous courses had fried components, so it was good that the bass was not fried and drenched with oil. I found this course to be average - nothing particularly different from other Chinese style bass.  7) poached snow pea tips with goji berry - a less greasy dish that complemented the meal well.  8) desert - black sesame desert - this is a traditional Chinese \"soup\" desert that is served warm. It tasted a little bit burnt and it didn't have the thick texture it was supposed to have.  Overall, I thought the meal was good for the value paid. Even though the meal was recommend for four people, we had a lot leftover. I just found the overall meal to be a bit too greasy/rich for my liking. The customer service was decent as well. The restaurant only accepts cash and debit, and is quite busy. If you are interested in enjoying some quality seafood prepared in Chinese cuisine, then I definitely recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Really nice presentations! Definitely will impress your dinner guests by coming here. Only thing I have to say is I wish there seasoning for the lobster and seafood were more savoury and salty. I find it a bit lacking compared to other Chinese seafood restaurants"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this restaurant because of all the pictures online but I could never justify it because of the price. I finally got a chance to come here for my friend's birthday. We got a combo for 8-10 people and it was $523.30 with tips and tax (they include the tip in the bill).  The first thing that came was the soup. I love Chinese soup! It tasted very good but nothing different from any other Chinese restaurants.  The first dish that came was the eel. I wasn't a fan of the eel because I prefer the debone BBQ eels more (like the ones you get at sushi). This eel was drenched in sauce and just a warning for others, there is bones in it.  Next, was the oysters. Again, I was underwhelmed by this dish. I feel like I've had better tasting oysters from other Chinese restaurants that don't specialize in seafood. I can't even remember if it was a sweet or savoury sauce. However, out of the two dishes mentioned so far, I think this one was better.  There was also a veggie dish and it was my favourite type - green pea sprout! It was a good dish. It wasn't a standout dish.   I don't really have any comments about the crab. Personally, I don't like eating crab just because it's difficult to open the shell. However, I was excited to see the lobster dish. For two lobsters, there was a lot of meat. I was not a fan of the way the lobster was cooked which was frying it. A lot of the meat was lost because it stuck to the shell. Also, even thought there was a lot of garlic, I didn't think the garlic flavour came through. Maybe it was because i was sick. The birthday boy mentioned that he prefer cooking the lobster two ways so that there was more variety. I think that's an option you can go for if you add more money.  The best dish of the night was the fish. It was done perfectly. It wasn't too dry or under-cooked. The skin came right off and it was very moist.  I wasn't a fan of this restaurant but it might be because I was recovering from a cold and I just didn't like the way things were cooked. It's a bit too pricey for me to give this restaurant another try again but I'm glad I gave it a shot."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that the restaurant was nicely decorated, especially for a Chinese restaurant.  The washrooms were not very clean though.  There were seven of us and we ordered one of the set lobster and crab dinners (steamed crab with egg, crab fried rice, lobster with garlic, another seafood dish, oyster mushrooms and vegetables).  I thought the food was tasty at first, but after a while, I really didn't like that practically everything was deep fried, but I guess this was a personal preference.  The aggressive waitress (she had her hair tied half down) would not leave us alone while we tried to decide on the menu and pressured to decide on a pricey set menu ASAP, which is a bit rude.  She told us that we would have to pay more today for crab because they didn't  have the 4 lbs crab as listed on menu and only had 6 lbs crab (I think I got the weight correct).  She didn't even crack a tiny smile once the entire time.  The waitress didn't seem to care about being sanitary and hygenic.  She threw the gigantic lobster and grab onto our table to show us for us to take photos without asking us  first and it scared the two children too!  LOL - That would have been okay, but then she DIDN'T WIPE THE TABLE afterwards and instead gave us a WEIRD LOOK when we asked her to change the bowls since we saw some dirty water from the creatures splash onto them.  I wonder what she would have done if we asked her to clean the table?  Well, she put our bowls onto another nearby table and brought from that other table to us.  Later on, another waiter setup our dirty bowls onto that other table to be used.  My sister and I wiped down our WET and contaminated table (where the creatures were) with her children's baby wipes.  For the price we paid and I'm guessing each table is spending minimum $200+, you would think the service would be spectacular and if the wait staff do not like serving customers than why are they there????  Despite the food be tasty, I'm rating this low due to the service.  I normally do not accept rude service, but my family does not like to make a big deal of things.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Bomb bomb bomb ! Flavorful and a must eat when in Toronto ! It's best if you have a reservation . Restaurant can get super busy !!!!"}
{"text":"Felt the need to update my review. I've been here many times with my family. It's our go-to restaurant for special occasions. They recently moved to a new location and for some reason I feel things have gone a bit downhill. First, the soup they serve, the size has decreased significantly. We used to be able to have two servings of the soup but now it's one. Second, the pricing structure has changed for some of the combos. I understand that with minimum wage increases or increase in food prices they also need to increase it. But since the restaurant is bigger, the service isn't as great, they also no longer provide wet naps but still charging 10% tip on top of your increased meal. I still think it's good, but not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"My bf and I are visiting Toronto for the third time and never tried this place before so we wanted to see what all the hype is about. We order the 4-5 person dinner which include   Shark fin soup King crab Steamed large leg with Butter Garlic Crab & Small Leg in Hong Kong Style Fried Rice in Crab Shell Baked Lobster Soup  Steamed Bass Braised Sliced Abalone with Vegetable Total price: $513 (tips Included/ we gave them over 10% tip and they gave it back to us saying that they already got 10%)   Believe me, all this food is definitely worth your whiled. The food here is better than Chicago!"}
{"text":"The service is bleh....... the place is bleh........ But OMG the food. If you are a seafood lover you have to try this place. Oh but they have this beef this with garlic i think its fried. It's also to die for. The bad thing is that they only take cash the portions are large and the wait time can sometimes be a little too long. Even when you make reservations you have to wait (not as much but still WAIT)."}
{"text":"Place is super busy and that is because the food is really something special the lobster tower is the best lobster I've ever had  highly recommend if your wallet allows be warned this is fine seafood dining"}
{"text":"WARNING! BRING CASH or have your Canadian DEBIT card because they got NO signs on that it being a cash only... Ridiculous because we aren't Canadians and couldn't use our credit cards... and we had to run around for an ATM which isn't even inside... They only mentioned it at the end.. which is crazy because their dinner for two costs around $100 starting! our bill was $200 and they include tip even for 2 people?   Service was junk.. took forever to get seated even with reservation (10 mins) when there was plenty of people sitting and standing around not even acknowledging us. Then forever to take our order (15 min). Never brought us our water, we asked multiple times...   No one said sorry, and just didn't care at all. So i told them to check your reviews.. You guys have decent food but service and cashier options are ridiculous... I guess its normal to drop $200-$1000 in cash for dinner here for everyone.  If you want the lobster tower its like $200+ i would just hit up another place that treats better. Food is basically the same everywhere"}
{"text":"We come here often for special occasions. The king crab is great and the lobster is also good. They're huge and come with tons of anchovies and fried garlic. I prefer the king crab to the lobsters though as the latter can get a bit boring after a while. I'm not sure what seasoning they use but sometimes I find the dry fried style a bit too salty. The oysters are delicious and so is the sweet and sour pork. Lastly the cashew sweet soup they give as dessert is yummy and a unique alternative to red bean soup. I'd recommend this place. They have set dinner times for reservations and it gets busy but it's worth it to try to the lobster/crab."}
{"text":"Came here to check out the infamous lobster tower. Presentation's impressive, but thought it was a little overhyped.   The 4 menus were a bit daunting with all the options and drastic price points - from approx. $15 to - $300+. Be careful of the cost/lb when you order as you wouldn't want to end up with a $300 lobster.  There was only 4 of us and so we got a selection of smaller lobsters and a smaller tower that didn't put us in the poorhouse. We ended up getting 3 1lb lobsters done 3 ways - magi, hong kong style and steamed, along with some noodles, Chinese broccoli and lobster fried rice.   Overall - the magi was the best one. 1lb is enough for 1-2 people. Equivalent to a regular sized lobster you'd find at a Red Lobster restaurant - and we got 3 which was more than enough.   We were surprised by how much food we got which was amazing. Spent about 68+tax on the food and they add the gatuity on for you. So we spent about $80 for 4 people - 3 lobsters, noodles and rice. That was pretty amazing and impressive. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Amazing Cantonese cuisine with gigantic lobsters and crabs the likes of which I've never seen. Food was truly outstanding. Unfortunately, service is sparse at best especially if you don't speak Cantonese. Sad as total customer experience could be significantly improved with better service and attitude. Go there for the food. Forget service so you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Lobster is easily one of my favorite foods in the world. I hadn't found a good lobster place in North America until I came to Toronto and tried Fisherman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant. I have come this place for more than ten times. Whenever my friends come to town or my parents come to visit, I would just take them there for sure.  I would say compared with other lobster places, especially these western ones, Fishman is much cheaper. At lease, it won't charge you $40 for only one lobster tail. For less than $150, you are able to get six pounds of lobster, chicken soup, vegetable, fried lobster brain rich and desert. And if you get three people to share all of these, it would be less than $50 for each person.   You can choose many ways to cook the lobster here, such as deep fried lobster with garlic or steam lobster claws. My favorite is \"Lobster in Hong Kong style\". They deep fried the lobster with small salty fish and garlic, and serve it in a huge plate. It is literally a lobster mountain.I am not kidding!!! And No chopsticks are need at all. You just eat with your bare hands (plastic gloves are available though). Just put that huge chunk of lobster meat into your month and you will know what I mean.   This place is quite popular in weekend and holidays, especially Chinese holidays, and they only take reservation at 6:00pm and 8:00pm every day according to what I know. However, for most of the time, even though you made reservation and show up on time, you may still have to wait a little bit for the table. They don't seem to be very efficient at their reservation system.         Almost all the staff here are Chinese and they are extremely nice. I guess it will be a little bit uncomfortable if you can't speak Chinese cause you will be almost completely surrounded by Chinese speakers. But I also noticed there are some waiters there who speak perfect  English, so I guess you will be fine."}
{"text":"Okay,   I've been to Fishman Lobster Clubhouse a few times when it was at the old location, but went to the new location for the first time last night and let me tell you there's a world of difference in the two locations in terms of decor, atmosphere but most of all service.  In the old location I would love to eat the food, but hated to order!  They would constantly upsell you saying you should pay for the more expensive tasting lobster, they only have a 3.51 pound lobster when you wanted a 2 pound lobster so you have to pay for 4 pound lobster...etc..  The only reason you would come back was the food.  In this location they've gone seriously upscale.  I highly recommend you reserve table a few days in advance especially on a weekend.  We reserved a table for 2 for 9:30pm on a Friday night (they close at 11:00pm) and the restaurant was still completely packed.  A courtesy reminder call was given 30 mins before our reservation so that was a nice touch.  They no longer try to upsell you the seafood and you pay what the scale is instead of them rounding up to the nearest pound.   Our lobster was 3.7 pounds so our lobster cost was 3.7 pound x $17.00/pound.  Service was very attentive and fast.  For any first timer, I recommend that you only order the seafood as that is what they do best.  Tanks full of lobster, king crab, Vancouver crab line the entire perimeter of the restaurant.  You can go for the set menus, or just do a la crate, but be aware the portions are really big and set menu of say 3-4 can easily feed a group of 5-6.   Do yourself a favour and walk around and see what some tables have ordered.  When we went a couple of large tables ordered 50 pounds of lobster that basically was a big as half the table and piled about 2-3 feet high!  Absolutely insane!  This is not a cheap restaurant as you should expect to spend anywhere from $50-$100 per person, but to be honest it's absolutely worth it as you'll probably spend that much for much less quality at a Red Lobster type of place anyways.  They do add 10% service charge on all tables so make sure you don't tip twice.  This restaurant is now absolutely perfect with the improvement they have made especially with the service.  This restaurant can compare to any seafood restaurant in the world and is not to be missed if you are a seafood lover!"}
{"text":"Amazing food !!!  You must love seafood. Must try restaurant !! Make reservations. Go in a big group and get the 3 lobster meal. Large portions, enough food for everyone at the table. Service is fast and quick. Not once did i have to ask for water refill. Pricey though... bring your wallet.  The only downfall, not the restaurants fault is, the line up at the receptionist to be seated.  We were waiting behind a family who was talking to the receptionist, then suddenly this rude woman walks right in front of us and tries to find out which table she is at.  We said excuse me, but we are next.  She says she has reservations. We said that we have reservations too, and probably everyone waiting to speak to the receptionist have reservations too.  These people should learn some manners, and learn to have some respect, and worse of all, there were kids around. Get off your high chair lady!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is packed and super busy. They had tables after tables coming in and a lot of people waiting too. Reservations are highly recommended. We made our reservations for 830p and got there a little early but they were able to seat us almost immediately.   Their menu selection was large. Our server recommended we get the fixed menu that's meant to feed 3-4 people. There were 4 of us that evening, but we had just been eating all around Toronto, so we only really needed enough to feed 2.5 of us. But we ended up getting it anyway since we wanted the selection of soup, lobster and also veggies. We also ordered crab (outside of the fixed menu) as we were craving for it. Since the lobster was already going to be Hong Kong style, our server recommended we get the crab steamed and it did not disappoint. It came out before the lobster and it was almost gone by that time. I was surprised we finished the entire dish.   As for the lobster, it was very delicious, crunchy with sweet and savory in each bite. However, due to it being fried, we were filled up pretty quickly. We could not finish this dish even if we tried.   The chicken soup was absolutely delicious. Very light but not bland at all. It was packed with flavor and reminded me of my childhood. The goji berries provided the sweetness for the broth. We also had the steamed veggies and that was gone fast too.   Overall this place is a must-visit if you're in the Toronto area and craving seafood. Happy indulgence :)"}
{"text":"This place was good, the serving portions where good. Would recommend anyone to go if they are looking for a Chinese style lobster feast!! We had a table of ten and everyone was satisfied.  One word of advice, just pig out on lobster and forget the other items.. We order Bass, chicken, beef, oysters and other things, but those dishes were all left untouched becUse everyone was too busy feasting on 30 lbs of lobster.. By the time we finished the lobster, everyone was full and all the other dishes were cold."}
{"text":"Freshest seafood find in Scarborough area! We were greeted by huge King crabs and lobsters in the clean water tanks upon entering the restaurant.  We tried the spicy Hong Kong style fried crab, steamed Lobster with Garlic and Lobster Congee -- enjoyed all the dishes, especially the spicy HK style fried crab.  Lots more dishes to try here such as Geoduck, oysters...  and a 4-pounder fresh lobster!"}
{"text":"One of the best lobster dishes I've ever had!  I've eaten so many mediocre ginger+scallion or baked lobster with cheese from other restaurants... so when my aunt and cousin wanted to treat me to this place, I wasn't too thrilled. My fiance and I agreed to go after my aunt told us she made reservation for us to this place for weeks. So glad we agreed to go.. or our tummy would definitely be missing out!   This place was hidden behind a gas station. Nothing too special from the outside. The entrance was lined up by tanks of live seafood. The place wasn't too big and was super packed with large tables of Chinese families when we arrived. We were seated after a 5 mins wait. My cousin and aunt did the ordering. We had the spicy stir fry lobster with small fried fish? The server placed our lobster (still moving) onto our table to show/ask us .. if it's acceptable. I quickly snapped a picture of it with my iphone and couldn't believe how HUGE it was. My cousin also ordered us a fish soup, a whole steamed fish, another smaller scallion + gingered lobster dish, lobster fried rice, and veggie side. For the main lobster dish, they gave us plastic gloves to eat with our hands. (I don't even glove this hard for my patients) We ate every piece of lobster meat  and even packed the leftover small fish home to snack on!  The flavor profile was that amazing! To end the meal, the restaurant served us complimentary black sesame soup. My fiance isn't a big fan of black sesame.. and my 2 cousins were too full. So i happily had all 4 bowls. I'm such a pig for sweets.  My aunt told me they have other amazing unique lobster dishes (other cooking style) and will treat us again when we visit!"}
{"text":"I was very, very hesitant in coming here with my friends because 1)  I thought it would be a complete wallet buster and 2) I thought that the food would be overhyped.  However, I'm glad to report that is it NOT!  :)  If you're into group dining with friends/family, Fishman Lobster Clubhouse is definitely a must-experience for seafood lovers!  Interior of restaurant is surrounded by tanks of lobster, different kinds of crab, and fish.  They specialise in lobster/crab cooked in various ways and that the HK method, re:  the one more photographed in a mountain/pyramid formation, is probably the most popular.  Note:  There is a surcharge $5 for the HK method.  However, if you're splitting the bill, it's quite minimal.  I observed 2 waiters carefully carrying a foot tall platter with pilled up lobster, so I had to take a pic of that!  Like an upscale restaurant, dirty dishes are replaced at least 2-3 times during the meal.  Servers weren't super friendly, but good.  Manager came to collect bill a coupla times even though we weren't ready.  Another manager brought 2 complimentary cans of Coke because he said that they did not have Coke Zero for a friend.  Lunch consisting of of a 5lb lobster (HK style), an entire Vancouver crab (deep fried with garlic), e-fu noodles, and lobster roe fried rice worked out to approx. $35/pp which was much lower than I expected!  I was stuffed and that was the only meal of the day for me."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum  Every wall was covered with tanks of seafood.   The lobster tower and other lobster and crab dishes were amazingly tasty. Even the non seafood dishes were yummy.   Service was attentive and friendly.   Service charge of 10% automatically added to bill...makes life easier."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing.   I have been here four times, once where the service was so terrible I didn't leave a tip (the only time I have ever done this, and I once had someone sneeze on me while serving my food and then laughed). They were extremely apologetic and promised to offer a better experience the next time.  Which they did.   I organized my mothers birthday here and thankfully thought to call a month in advance because this place is always packed.   We ordered the dinner for 10-13 people and my God, I was not expecting the amount of food we got. It came with 50 pounds of lobster (Hong Kong Style), pea shoots, an order of fried rice, a bottle of wine and 10 soft drinks. We also ordered a full steamed chicken and noodles with crab meat. We also ordered a bunch of beer. In total the bill came to $950. Yes it is a bit pricey, but considering the number of people it fed and the amount of food we took home we were all more than content and satisfied.   My family loved it so much that we are planning on going for Christmas dinner. Thank god, I will take a feast of lobster any day over a turkey any day!"}
{"text":"If you love SEAFOOD then this is the spot to be. This restaurant isn't your typical Chinese seafood restaurant so make sure you make a reservation especially on a weekend. The day that I originally wanted to go was already booked so I had to go the day before instead. If you have a party of 10 or more, it's best to make your reservation at least 7-10 days ahead.  Their meal deals are worth it and the lobsters are huge. Once you pick out your meal, the servers will bring the lobster and/or crab out to your table. This is where you need to take your cameras out and take pictures. The portion of your food is huge and reasonable. Food is flavorful and very satisfying."}
{"text":"Enjoy the meal...  one of the parties that worked there saw da total confusion on our faces and lent a helping hand in directing us...     Definitely best experienced as a group to get the best value, though I was not totally overwhelmed by the price...   seeing how the lobster went well the next day for breakfast and lunch   Be ready to move, everyone there waits on you to keep you moving!!!"}
{"text":"Been heard this place was excellent for a long time , we purposely make a trip to come try it out , which is surprisingly good and cheap compared to NYC , we had the 10lbs king crab and 15 lbs Lobster plus a fish , half chicken and vegetables for 6 people that's way too much foods for us , but it is really finger licking good"}
{"text":"One of the best places for lobster.  Celebrated Chinese New Years with the family.  Selected one of the pre-set -dinners....12lbs of lobster a cooked two ways, 8lbs of crab, steamed fish-really good, veggies and a few other dishes round out dinner.  It wasn't cheap, but I will be back!"}
{"text":"Holy lobster!  Never have I had lobster cooked and presented in such a mouth watering fashion before. Before cooking the lobster they will present to you the size and lobster before it's prepared by the chief. Later they fry and cut it in a certain way where ALL the meat are very easy to peal off the shell seasoned with their salted recipe. Truly mouth watering.  great for a family and friend gathering if you like lobster"}
{"text":"OMG ... I want to come here everyday! But I'm not sure if it's possible to get full from seafood. Anyhow, our group had a set dinner for 6/7 ppl. It was absolutely AMAZING!!!! I LOVE the way lobster is prepared & seasoned the Chinese way. Tasty and just perfection. Our group spent $ 47 pp including tax and tip.   I did not really like the crab as there was little meat and way too much effort to eat it. Love the seasoning for the crab though. But that lobster was out of this world. We also ordered some side dishes such as fried rice (a little on the small side) and veggies.   Service was wonderful and everything came promptly. Reservations highly recommended. It was super crowded.  I was a little disturbed cuz they brought over the fish, lobster and crab in a bucket before preparing it for us. I felt so sad when I saw the fish struggling to breathe and finally took it's last breath...."}
{"text":"First off, I'm not a seafood person and lobster is probably my least favorite food of all time but boy, I was blown away by how tasty the lobster tower was. The dish is garlicky and very well seasoned with deep fried lil' white fishes and topped with healthy shreded lettuce to offset the ridiculous amount of cholesterol you are about to eat.   We got the package that comes with a bottle of wine, soup, veggies and two 8+ lbs lobsters and it was way too much food for 5 ppl. We ended up with two trays of togo containers.   Service is okay, just like you would expect from every Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"It's beginning to look like a tourist place and food is overrated. It tasted better a few years ago. They will suggest you to go with the set menu, but I think it's better to go a-la-carte. We had 4 adults and 3 kids and we ordered dinner for 4.. couldn't finish everything.  BTW, they accept cash only"}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese place for special occasions - perfect for birthdays, anniversaries, Chinese holidays. It's on the pricier side for Chinese cuisine but the food options and quality gives you a bang for your buck.  My family of 4 got the $138 combo (which is listed for 3 people). It doesn't come with any sort of rice/noodle dish, so we also ordered the $13 lobster roe fried rice as well. This was MORE than enough food, and we ended up taking most of the rice and a few pieces of lobster home. Based on the tables, having lots of leftovers seems to be a common occurrence. Chinese people love seafood, and just as importantly, love it if it's presented in a grand manner. (I have to say, the stacking ordeal of the lobster/king crab did attract me in to coming here.) So most tables order quite a bit of seafood to make their tower more impressive. What's great is that the waiters will package your fried lobster/king crab legs in a tin foil tray, making it super easy to oven it the next day! (You can even bring the soup home as well).  The $138 combo includes: - 4.5 pounds of lobster: Since it's hard to get the exact weight of lobsters, the waiters bring the actual lobster to you and if it's over the weight listed on the menu, they'll ask if you are willing to add the extra cost. We ended up with a lobster weighing 5.2 pounds and had to add an extra $12. Having eaten such a large lobster, it's so hard to go back to eating ones from supermarkets. The amount of meat is so much bigger :3 The stacked tower of lobster came with a ridiculous amount of fried garlic (took that home to mix with rice the next day..) MMMM very delicious! I can see why people come here.  - 3 large oysters dipped in egg yolk and then fried in batter: quite a unique taste!  - Steamed flat fish: very fresh  - snow pea leaves with the Chinese version of prosciutto: eating this with the soup broth it comes in is very delicious! Good balance to the seafood-y meal.  - soup: I normally don't comment on the soup that Chinese restaurants always serve for dinner despite what you order...but this was great! Not full of MSG and it came with so much of the ingredients used to cook the soup (so much chicken in there)  - dessert: It was the black sesame one that day; nothing too unique."}
{"text":"Mind you when I was going to FLCR it was snowing and traffic sucked! It took us almost two hours from Mississauga, I hangry, cranky and throughout the drive I keep saying to myself this better be awesome and worth the trip. So we got there, luckily I made reservation ahead of time (Highly Recommended), even with the snow this place is packed. I can only imagine what this place look like on normal weekend.  The host sat us down as soon as we arrive, our table is in the middle of the dining room so I was able to enjoy in awe the 360 degree aquarium filled with giant lobsters, king crab, fluke, etc. It's better than going to aquarium because with this one you get to pick your king crab or lobster and eat it.. LOL  The restaurant offers four different menu and it can get confusing especially when you're hangry and all you can think about is food. There's a section for a la carte menu, for patrons who don't wish to indulge king crab and/or lobster. you can also purchase the crab or lobster a  la carte and be charged by the lbs. I highly recommend order from the package menu, I went with the King Crab and Lobster for four people (trust me when I say there's enough food for probably five maybe six people). The price for that is CAD$298 (ohh btw, bring cash or debit card-canadian bank only. I made the mistake of trying to use U.S.A issued debit card and the restaurant will not take it.  It's very hard for me to describe the feeling and excitement because dining here is truly a multi sensory experience. You can see, feel, touch, smell, and hear all the hustle bustle of the restaurants. The \"aawww and ohhhs\" from patrons when they receive the giant platter of perfectly cooked lobster and king crab.  One thing that I found really cool about this place was the fact that the waiter brought us the King Crab and Lobster that they're going to cook for us. The server will go over the weight with you and our crab happened to be under by almost 1 lb. The server offered us more lobster with double the amount so essentially we're getting 2 lbs worth of lobster.   You will need to experience this first hand to understand how amazing the food, service and the ambiance. It may seems a bit expensive but it's worth every penny, especially if you're from the U.S. By the time, you convert it back to U.S dollars you'll be saying to yourself why the hell didn't I do this sooner. It's priced just right! Plus, you can find money but memories you will need to build and create :)  So pack up your bag or not you can day trip if you leave around upstate New York and head up to Canada.  Bon Appétit !"}
{"text":"We had the $368 set for 6 people. It included lobster, king crab, sea bass, greens, and soup. After tax and tip, it came out to about $85/person. I've been to similar restaurants nearby with similar quality that are relatively cheaper around $70/person. I've never seen a restaurant as rushed as this one. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, everything was hectic and seemingly disorganized. Food was fine, but we expect better for the price that we were paying. There was a dead fly in my sister's soup. Not a big deal to us, but it may be for others."}
{"text":"Terrible service! We went for my mother's birthday and we had an ice cream cake. We told them multiple times it was ice cream and to put it into the freezer. When it was time for the cake they brought it out half melted! And acted as if nothing was wrong! They continued to pretend everything was fine and served it to everyone.   My family didn't want to cause a scene so instead we weren't as generous when it came to tipping. HOWEVER even after providing terrible customer service the manager chased my father as we were leaving and had the audacity to ask for more tip.   Never coming back here. Save yourself the trouble, this place is overrated."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. We ordered the combo which contains a 6lb king crab and the waitress told us we need to pay $40 more because the crab is over 6lb......We had some argument with the waitress because we don't like being treated as dumb customers... then she impatiently agreed to find a crab which is 'a little bit overweight'.....I won't go there again because I just don't like to talk with such waitress"}
{"text":"It's not bad but kinda pricey."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but my most recent experience was two weeks ago where I came for a friend's birthday.  We ordered the combo around $699 because it said it fed around 10-13 people. I personally did not look too hard at what we ordered and that was mistake because a majority of the meal was just lobster. Too much lobster for 10-13 people. It was about 50 pounds of lobster and we ended up with 3 contains worth of feed by the end of the night. We had about 12 people and only managed to finish half the lobster.  The course came with soup, lobster, snow pea leaves, fried rice and a bottle of wine. Overall, the lobster was delicious and there was assortment of flavours. I think they had 3 different flavours for 3 lobsters but the pieces are put together into a tower so I couldn't tell if it was 2 or 3 flavours.  My tip would be not to order based on the amount of people it feeds and to select the option with more variety. Trust me, there is enough lobster to go around."}
{"text":"As far as Asian restaurants go, there is absolutely no better place in Toronto to enjoy a lobster meal.   The walls of the restaurants are filled with lobster tanks, and on display at the front near the entrace are tanks with giangantic king crabs.  There are different combo menus to choose from if you don't want to order items separately. One menu focus entirely on lobsters, and the other is both lobster + king crab.   The prices seem high at first - We paid $399 for a 8-person lobster set menu, which includes a starter soup, a 25-pound lobster mountain (HK style), a veggie (snow pea leaves) and dessert. Once ordered, a waitress drags a bucket to show you the humongous lobsters that would make the lobster mountain - 2 giant 12.5 pound lobsters that are as big as half your body!  The starter soup is a Chinese herbal soup with goji berries and black-skinned chicken, and I thought it tasted good.  The lobster mountain is rolled out on a cart, and because of how big it is, it drew the attention of all the diners it passed by. It really was quite a sight to see, and this isn't even the biggest lobster mountain they have!  The HK style lobster mountain is basically lobster that is cut up and flash fried, and the lobster meat is perfectly done and not overcooked. Along with the lobster are many deep fried little white fish that act as almost-like fries and minute amounts of lettuce. The taste is wonderful at first, but after a while it does get overwhelming because there is SO much of it. The veggies (a moutain in itself!) arrived mid-course and it was a welcomed palate cleanser.  This set menu also came with a cheap-ish bottle of Pinot Grigio which didn't impress by itself, but went well with the lobster.  With 8 people, we did manage to finish the whole lobster mountain (lots of the little deep fried fish reamins), and none of us felt it was not enough or too much.  The dessert was a very light hot almond/cashew (?) soup-like dessert. I guess fairly standard for Chinese restaurants.  Overall, we paid about $65 a person after tax and tip, and we all felt that this was an epic meal. I would totally come back again to try their king crab and fish as well. Booking in advance is mandatory as this place is jam packed! A++++"}
{"text":"This place has some seriously fresh and good seafood! I had reserved the place for dinner  after my small city hall wedding with close friends. We were a group of thirteen people and ordered their set lobster dinner recommended for 10-13 people and we barely finished half of the Lobster Mountain! The set dinner comes with starter soup, Lobster Mountain, a veggie dish, fried rice with lobster roe, dessert, and a bottle of white wine. We also ordered two of their king crab, but on hindsight it was too much food even for our large group. I had left overs from the lobster mountain for days.  The staff was efficient. They also bring out the lobsters and the crabs to show you the size and freshness of the seafood.   This is a Chinese style seafood restaurant so the seating is tight, not much waking space between tables, and it can be very noisy with family and friends gatherings commonly taking place here. I don't mind the noise as I like the restaurant bustling with energy.   My favorite part of the meal was the Lobster Mountain and the lobster roe fried rice.   This place only accepts debit or cash, and for larger parties I would recommend reserving in advance.  Overall I had a great experience here. The seafood here was definitely one of the best I've ever had and I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Great place for your seafood needs. A tad expensive but it is well worth it. This restaurant has gone through a lot of ownership changes but I hope this restaurant stays for a long time. It's a great place for groups and taking pictures for their exotic lobster towers."}
{"text":"this place requires lots of cash (literally - they don't accept card i heard). but to say its expensive - depends on your definition of the word. Quality of food as well as the satisfaction you get from eating fresh quality seafood I would say the price is okay. You have got to try this place. the texture of fresh live sea food is very much different to the frozen ones that most places serve in the GTA. I come from a hometown by the sea , trust me I know the difference even though I consider my palate to be amateur. I highly recommend getting the fresh crab, you will taste the sweetness of the meat. I prefer it to be cooked in their signature Hongkong Style . Its an absolute must !!"}
{"text":"Today I went here for the first time, after reading many bad reviews I was not sure I should go. I'm glad I went anyway, it was much better than expected. We wanted king crab but they were all sold out, so we got the 5 lbs lobster, 4 course lunch with lobster mountain.  Everything tasted so delicious, even the tea came with it  was good.  For lunch, I think it's cheaper, $18/lb lobster,I think the king crab would be $38/lb king crab. We got lobster,  it came with the lobster mountain, lobster roe fried rice, poach snow pea tips and black sesame pudding. They only accept cash and debit card, automatic added in 10% tip.  Attached are some pictures of my lobster before n after, forgot to take picture of the dessert. Hope i can upload them. It was great experience overall, very good service, waitress came checked on us often. The bathroom was really clean, maybe because they  just moved to this new location on Finch in Toronto, so everything was clean and new. The bill was $110 for 4 people."}
{"text":"I thought this place was one of those gimmicks - but it was surprisingly tasty! Prices were more affordable than I thought especially considering it's seafood. We didn't order the set menus because it seemed like way too much for the suggested amount of people.  Lobster HK style was great! Despite being deep fried, it didn't look as oily as I thought it would. We got the crab cooked more mildly with garlic and the flavour wasn't as powerful. I think it would've tasted better HK style instead. The vegetable dishes were good additions for all the grease you consume.  This place has the typical Asian restaurant noise and rowdiness. They bring you a live lobster / crab to show to you what you'll be eating as a little show.  Takes debit and cash only.  I'd come back again with a group of friend as this place is perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"Love this place!  If i could afford it, i would come weekly.  Wish they took credit cards, I would have collected so many points.  We come here for special occassions and when family is in town.  Absolutely love their steamed crab legs with onion in broth.  So light and tasty I can eat 2 plates by myself (no joke).  It gets too heavy eating all the fried versions of the lobster and crab sometimes, though they are very delish as well. It feels like a treat eating here and the price reflects it.  But oh soo good you can't deny the quality."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat, hands down.   I would recommend going with a larger group, more people = bigger lobster mountain, and trust me, it tastes as good as it looks. The lobster is seasoned and fried to perfection, so perfectly juicy and tender, and when you eat it with the accompanying tiny fried fish and fried garlic pieces, it makes for a perfect mouthful.   It seems you can order one combo per table since the prices for combos are obviously cheaper than ordering individually, so just choose one appropriate for your party size and enjoy!   The bill for my party of 4 usually comes out to be around $250-300, so it's not something you want to have for dinner every single day. But do come here and give it a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place drew a lot of attention as it was featured on The Bizzare Foods Show. Naturally, I was curious too and wanted to see what the fuss was about. The seafood was very fresh and well prepared, especially the Alaskan king crab steamed with egg white and salted duck yolk. The lobster was also tasty fried with chillies and fried whiting. Be prepared to come with a lot of people as the portions are very large and you get a better value out of it. Also, it seems that the combos are more cost efficient than ordering a la carte. Just be careful that the actual lobster/crab they give you might weight a bit more than what the menu said, so you might be charged additional money/pound. Otherwise, a nice place to satisfy my seafood craving."}
{"text":"If you like lobster this is the place to go! This was our last meal in Toronto and the best! We went on a Friday at lunch time and there was no wait. Because it was just me and my husband, we asked for the smallest lobster and it was almost 5 pounds. We took advantage of the lunch special. It was very worth it and probably enough for 3-4 people. I'm  attaching pictures of what is included in the special and the receipt. We look forward to returning when we are visiting Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese seafood in GTA. $50-100 per person.Some staff were nice if you know how to speak Cantonese. Must order HK style Lobster and the crab.Good place for friends  and family gathering."}
{"text":"Finally found an occasion recently to come try the dinner here at Fishman Clubhouse.  My uncle and aunt were here from the US visiting and I knew this place was very impressive with their seafood especially their signature dish, lobster mountain.  Being a foodie, my friends are always surprised when I told them that I've never tried this place.  Okay, I can now finally check it off my list.  There were mostly set menus and we decided to go for the $399 Seafood Dinner A set for the 10 of us.  This included soup, a 12 lbs lobster, fried crabs, eel, steamed fish, veggies, fried oysters with honey pepper sauce, pops and a bottle of Masi white wine.  It's a pretty good deal and everything was delicious.  It was just a bit messy to eat the crabs and lobster.  We also pay $5 extra to get the lobster partially steamed and $16 for lobster fried rice.  We probably didn't need to order the fried rice since we were all really full and some leftovers to pack home.  The only thing I have to complain about was the service.  We heard from friends that they often will increase the bill because they will tell you that they couldn't get a lobster that is exactly the size you ordered so you'll end up paying another $10 to $20.  We made it very clear to our server when we ordered that we didn't want any lobster larger than 12 lbs.  She agreed to try but she wasn't too please with our request.  She also didn't make much effort with explaining the options.  Overall, it was a bit pricey but it was definitely worth the experience.  We will likely be back if we have a special occasion."}
{"text":"I always go here when I'm craving Hong Kong style lobster. I love how when you walk in there are tanks of lobster and king crabs tanks all around the restaurant.   The menu is very long and has a lot of set price to choose from. I believe they only take cash and debit.  I love how they show you the lobster before they cook it so you can take photos with it and see what your actually getting.  My friends and I ended up getting one of the set menu which had 16lbs lobster cook Hong Kong style, fried rice, and dessert. The bill came up to $300 but this could feed about 5-6 people. We had a lot of left overs to take home.   Overall it's a very good experience, I would highly recommend it for groups of people and it was very tasty."}
{"text":"We did the set menu for 5-6 people and ordered side dishes of the lobster row fried rice and beef pepper tenderloin. The side dishes are small, good to sample a spoon or two but pretty pricey for that.   The white wine that came with set menu was a Massi Pinot Grigio, not bad, only strange part was I had to keep asking the waiter to bring it as all the food was here and beer was finished. He did and asked confused if I wanted to bring it home instead, but I insisted we needed 5 glasses.  Needless to say service is Chinese style meaning they can be fast but not attentive, thorough or friendly. We needed an English speaking waiter so we had to keep waiting for him to come after flagging someone down for something.   Lobster mountain did not disappoint, 3 massive lobsters that came 1.1 lb over so extra $10 charged on top. You will see photos of people holding seafood all night followed but Oohs and Aahhs when the food arrives.   Black chicken soup(excellent remarked everyone)  Snow pea leaves mountain(good) Lobster mountain(excellent) 2 side dishes(lobster rice and beef) 3 beers 1 btl Pinot Grigio  Black sesame dessert  Tax and 10% mandatory service tip came in at $410.92   Great to bring guests for the novelty of the mountain but definitely way over priced and  service was not to par."}
{"text":"If you love seafood, you have to come here. Must haves are lobster mountain and crab legs. Lots of cooking options available but the consistently good ones are HK style and maggi. If you're feeling like you want something different, get the salted egg. It's amazing for those that love it, but the salted egg flavor may be polarizing for some.   We always get sets instead of a la carte options because the sets provide better value and you get a variety of different seafood dishes to feast on.   Overall, this place is fantastic and my family has been back here many times for birthdays and special occasions. It's not inexpensive, but for the food that you're getting, it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Make a reservation and know what you want before you sit down. We waited over half an hour after 8pm on a Wednesday night. It took a while to get someone to take our order. However after we ordered everything came together. We ordered crab and lobster for four to feed six adults and had leftovers. The tower of crab legs and lobster mountain were loaded with garlic. Definitely make a stop if you have a small crowd and love seafood."}
{"text":"Dinner and show place is. Everyone comes here to either eat a pile of lobster or King crab. The standard order is a massive king crab where they bring it out and show you the size.  They then cut it up and serve it in many ways. It's massive enough to feed like 6-8 people.   This type of place is generally a bit much for me. It's really loud, I find it a bit gimicky, and it's definitely priced on the high side. that said, the food is actually really good so I have to forgive all of that."}
{"text":"My family and I always enjoy meals here.  We always come on empty bellies since we know we will be eating a lot of yummy, fresh seafood!  Their lunch specials are definitely a good deal.  You cannot substitute any items, but the lunch menu has everything you want/need for the meal.  For the 4 of us, we got the house soup to start, followed by a 5-5.5lb lobster - cooked/fried with lots of garlic, onion, tiny fishies.  We got a fresh steamed bass, and a plate of snow pea tips with goji berries.  Plenty of food for 4 people, we even had to take some of the lobster to go.  The quality of their food never disappoints and there's always a line.   **Remember to reserve a table ahead of time!"}
{"text":"This is the place to come for celebrations, anniversaries, birthdays, or when you're trying to impress out of town visitors.   Tip: RESERVATIONS. or else you'd be waiting for an hour or be told there's no more spots for the night.  There menu is basic as we usually order off of one of the big sheets that states the number of people it'll serve.  Totally don't remember what my mom ordered but I LOOOOVED everything here.  When you order they bring out the live thing to show you.  The guy held up a 20lb lobster for us once. Damn.  There are several ways to cook it.  The waitress/waiter will explain better than I can.  But I usually go for the normal Chinese standard lobster or the one that's fried with little fishies.  The staff had a huge turnover and I feel like they included more English-speaking individuals amongst them now.  Food is actually pretty quick as the place is always packed ~ 25 minutes for the first dish to come and the rest will follow quickly behind it.  They do give you gloves in case you don't want to get your hands dirty.   Cons: - The tables are REALLY close together, as they struggle for space (as well as their parking lot). - People there are L O U D. Omg. - The staff is so busy they actually might forget one of your side orders (that's not off the big menu).  Just remind them. - Only 2 or 3 stalls in the washroom so might be packed. - Price, it is fair but because I'm a newly graduated it is WAAAAY above my budget :(   Amazing food. Hands down. Will always be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night at 8pm and it was packed!! Luckily I called for a reservation 3 days in advance. So please make reservation ahead of time.  The menu choices were a bit overwhelming. But the waiter went through it with us..you can pick combos or order al la carte. The four of us ended up ordering Lobster HK style dinner for 3-4 people and another order of Vancouver crab (2.5lbs). The waiter then came back with our live lobster and crab...where we took a photo with the lobster. As we looked around the room, everyone was posing with their lobsters as if they caught it..I did feel sad for the lobsters that were about to die for us and had to be used as a prop for photos...  Anyways, our dinner included Chinese style chicken soup, sautéed vegetable, 5.5lb lobster, sea bass, and dessert soup. We chose to steam our crab, which was the best decision ever! It was steamed in some sauce that was light and flavorful. This is especially important as the HK style lobster will be fried and it is just impossible to enjoy that much fried food in one setting. Everything tasted delicious..but I will skip the Hk style lobster next time, it was just too much.  I also couldn't taste that much lobster meat because everything was coated in flour.  We of course could not finish our food. No one could..but the wait staffs were very happy to pack your meal for you. They did a good job removing bones and shells. Take them home..it will be another delicious meal!  As it was cash only, we were able to take money from Scotia bank next door at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try out Fisherman. After seeing all the hype with the lobster mountains, I was a little disappointed that my whole entire experience is just average.. I was expecting the food to taste amazing and out of this world, but I guess my expectations were a little too high..  Reservation process was weird. One of my friend called in to book a table for 12 people, but was told that there was a $500 deposit needed for such a large group. Then another friend called in the next day and made a reservation with no problem and didn't require any deposit for a group of 12 ... I'd like to point out that the second time my friend spoke Chinese, whereas the first time it was English. HM.. weird and inconsistent, even feel a little discriminatory but whatever LOL  It was cool of them to show us all the seafood before it is cooked, I believe we added another crab and lobster fried rice to our combo. This came up to a total of $900 after tax and tips, for a group of 12 it was $75 per person so not so bad!   Honestly ... I found the lobsters and food to be quite bland. The seasoning on the lobster and crab was superb but it didn't soak into the meat so the meat was so flavourless ...there was also a ridiculous amount of fried onion on the lobster mountain plate too like holy crap LOL if there was ever an onion drought you'll know whose fault it is  my favourite was the lobster fried rice, the least bland dish there was LOL it is REALLY filling though .. we took a bunch of left overs home so it is worth the money but taste wise I'm still debating ... I wish the meat wasn't so bland I'd enjoy it more ..   I will return later in the future of course because the seasoning was too die for !! I recommend going in a large group and getting the bigger combos, you get more selection and the experience itself is really nice :)"}
{"text":"Our friend told us we must visit this restaurant for their seafood offerings....boy, we are so glad we did.  We ordered the 6lb King crab combo meal, and even though it was advertised for 2 people, the 3 of us can't even finish all the food.  The crab was cooked to perfection, and service was very swift and friendly.  You will most probably never see so many tanks of lobsters, king crabs, and other seafood again.  Make sure you bring cash."}
{"text":"My whole family and I love this place. We usually go here for the fixed order menu that cost usually around 5-8 hundred. We get two tables for our party and two sets of the same dishes. The service is okay - I feel like they should be more handy and helpful. The food is great!! I dined here for my birthday, also my cousins, and my aunts! If you haven't tried this place you must even though it is pricey; it is worth it all. They renovated the store... Well they totally moved two blocks to SilverStar. Their old location was small but was always packed. Now that the location they have is even bigger and spacious, IT IS ALWAYS STILL PACKED!   I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered a 5 lbs lobster with rice and veggie combo. The lobster was cooked \"HK style\", which comes with fried small fishes and garlic! It was fantastic!!! We also ordered honey pepper fried oysters which was good and very peppery! The combo came with a chicken  soup which was cooked for hours! Very yummy!  We could not finish the lobster and took most of it home! Overall the experience was amazing and there was no \"over charge\" on the final bill! We shall meet again soon!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to celebrate your b-day which I did here. We were in a group of 6 people. This one was near Steeles and Brimley. You can order your seas food from the aquariums @the restaurant directly. The good: although it's a bit pricey(You are at a sea food resto!) There are plenty of affordable options which is great for large groups. You do get a good helping though. We ordered their crab and of course lobster specialties. The bad: not really made for an intimate dinners..a bit cramp at this eatery. The ugly: this is an Asian restaurant so you would think it may serve some of the more traditional meals found in normal Asian restaurant but No they don't...so kids who don't like sea food and those allergic to sea food don't have a choice really. Tip: order the lobster mountain their speciality favorite of their clients, it takes 15 to prepare so order as one of your main meals right away. Sea food is costly but there are meal packages $$-$$$"}
{"text":"Today we went there for lunch with a group of 10 people. TERRIBLE SERVICE! Will Not return.  The restaurant was not busy and still no one helped us. They sat us down and didn't give us menus. We asked three different people for menu. Our main waitress had an unhappy face and very rude. She gave us menus then no one brought tea. They force you to accept very large lobster with very tough meat. We ordered extra friend rice and noodles to eat with the lobster but they never came until the end. No one offered water, waitress was never found. We had their congee - bland and watery. We asked for soy sauce and it was brought out in rice bowls, 10 bowls of soy sauce!!  Never before have we seen such thoughtless service. We brought a family of friends there for Father's Day lunch and were so embarrassed that we chose this restaurant.  Our food took too long to come. Not going back there."}
{"text":"Best Asian style lobster you can get in Toronto. This place is always jam packed so make sure you call to make reservations before coming in.  The go to dish here is the lobster HK style. It's deep fried and garnished with fried garlic and small fish. They also have king crab which is also delicious.    It's best to order the set combos. You do get a better deal.   Definitely come here if you're visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"Expensive and you need to be at least 3 or 4 to have access to the good and large menus, but it definitely is worth the experience! (also, better if you reserve a table!!)  Huge lobsters, huge king crab, fast and well prepared. No real fanciness, but freshness and consistent food.  Will go back, perhaps once or twice per year, when craving for king crab!"}
{"text":"Man, I don't even know. I've never eaten anything like this before. All I know is it was SO delicious and SO filling that a three person meal lasted us for three whole meals. And just like Louis CK, I don't stop eating when I'm full, I stop eating when I hate myself, so that's gotta be saying something.  The meal consisted of 2 fresh lobsters that they bring to your table for inspection, made deep fried and delicious. I can't even explain the huge tower of awesomeness they bring to you. It's daunting and intimidating. This is the type of meal you put a bib on for. We got some noodles as well, but they just get in the way of lobster awesomeness. Good, but skippable to make room for more fucking lobster! A huge vat of congee which I suggest you don't skip, because it makes it feel like you're detoxing your body from the deep fried deliciousness, thus enabling you to eat even more lobster. It's a sick and twisted cycle. A big bowl of veggies with goji berries. These veggies have a buttery flavour to them and again come highly recommended as it relieves the feeling of guilt you may have from eating all that fried lobster, further allowing you to enjoy even more lobster goodness. And a bowl of red bean soup, which I skipped in fear of barfing from all that food that just went into my belly.  For all that you get, the value is incredible. They screwed up our order a bunch of times and the service was slow, but I am willing to overlook that as long as I have that garlicy lobster goodness. I must eat all the things on this menu."}
{"text":"If you are visiting Toronto and love king crab or lobster this place is a must! The extra cost for Hong Kong style is worth it. I was surprised that they only accept cash or Canadian debt. If you're visiting from another country be sure to bring cash."}
{"text":"3 out of 5 because of service. I did not know this was a busy spot, so I checked the time it opens I couldnt find it so I called them at 10:30pm and they open 11am to 11pm. The lady said there really busy do you want to make a reservation? And the earliest is 1:30pm which was pretty good. Once we got there we had a table for 13, which was a nice size, the menu has some preset options to choose from  Lobster mountain and crab and all that for $699 it said it feeds 10-12 people but the rice fed for like 7 Max people LOL not sure if it was too busy but we didn't even have a server after 30 mins of just waiting for one. We called out a random server and all of a sudden he was our server lol  While they brought the mountain of lobster we mentioned we didn't get our soup... and she was in shock like \" you guys didn't get your soup?\" At that moment we knew that something was off.   Server also confused us, a few times, and never had enough spoons and forks, not to be picky but even the server said, \"my math is always terrible\" LOL that was funny.  I noticed no one at the table even asked how the food was because it was just drenched in fried garlic, which is okay for me but not for everyone. He hype is definitely real, if you want to experience taking a picture with a lobster, eat the lobster piled up as a mountain this is the spot, don't expect the perfect service tho."}
{"text":"Visiting from the US, I heard good things about this restaurant, serving Hong Kong style fried lobster and King Crab. This place is not for the faint of heart and best to come with a large group. The dining area is hectic, packed, full of energy and seafood. The prices are definitely on the higher end, especially for a place that is cash only.   Once you can bear the crowd, the servers and the price, what you get is a once in a lifetime experience. You order family style pre-fixed dinners, their speciality as many have noted in other reviews is the mountain of lobster and King crab. When you make your selection your server will bring out the lobster and crab still alive, ready for you to inspect (and snap a pic or two).   After you're done and sending it off its way, what comes out minutes later is perfectly carved, mountain of shellfish that is cooked to perfection. This is not the cleanest of dinners as the restaurant will leave a box of plastic gloves for you to get down and dirty with your food. Don't worry about making a mess, everyone else is doing it. If you are a shellfish lover this is a once in a lifetime experience, and it'll help if you can bring a Cantonese friend to translate for you ;)"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this restaurant after my family and friends rant and rave about how amazing it was. I had huge expectations of this place! Got there and it was packed! You have to make reservations a week in advance.  Decor was your typical Chinese restaurant. Nothing special. I did noticed all the tables ordered very similar things. I went with my 2 aunts and my grandparents, so 5 of us. We ordered the dinner for 4. It was a lot of food. The dinner for four I say can feed 7-8 people. We have 4 boxes to take home after.  The dinner for four came with the black herbal chicken soup of the day( which is supposed to be good for you) or corn soup.  Also came with 6 lbs lobster Hong Kong style lightly batter and friend with friend onions on the side. Also came with king crab served 3 ways - crab legs fried with garlic Hong Kong style, then steamed crab legs with salty eggs and crab meat friend rice with the crab shell. Also a side order of snow peas tips in goju berry stir fried.  For dessert there was black sesame pudding. All in all the service was ok like your typical Chinese restaurant. Cash or debit only.  No credit cards.  There's a 10% service charge automatically tacked onto the bill.  Food after awhile tasted salty. I noticed the lobster due to the large size tasty rubbery and chewy.  I'm not sure I can eat this meal all the time but I'm glad I tried it to get it out of my system. I thought for the amount of seafood you get the price was reasonable.  I've had better seafood elsewhere."}
{"text":"As expected, eveything was spectacular .... massive, photogenic lobsters and crabs -delicious.    All cultural and other idiosyncrasies aside ... when \"Wing\" (seemingly one of the senior managers) literally snatched cash off of our table before we even had 30 seconds to look at the bill and then says \"ok\" while motioning to get the hell up and out of his money making seats . . . . It just leaves a bad taste in any customers mouth.  Smarten up."}
{"text":"Pros - Very tasty at a good price for the set meal of 4 for the Lobster & Crab menu. Couldn't finish it.   Cons - they don't take CC.  WHAT! They said they were willing to take USD.  So by the end of our meal, the hostess counted the $$ in front of us to make sure we had enough CAD to pay our bill including tip.   My waitress never came back to check if we needed to change plates.  By time I was a full, another waitress showed up and was very apologetic that it wasn't done.    Would come back because the seafood was so good; just don't expect exceptional service."}
{"text":"I have been told the kitchen staff has changed a year or two ago, and since then, not been as good.  On my first trip here recently, I certainly would agree even though I was not lucky enough to have tried this place when the kitchen talents were there.  Lobster dish was subpar.  Alaskan Giant King Crab was good.  In order for me to really recommend a place, they must be able to hit 8 out of 10 on their ability to execute my table's entire order.  In this case, only thing that was decent was King Crab, which is kind of dull.    Price wise, it's reasonable.    Tastes wise, subpar.  King Crab tasted good because it was fresh and that's how fresh King Crab should always taste, hard to mess it up as long as you don't over cook it.  8 lb lobster was disappointment, the kitchen did not cook it right, poor lobster got cheated out of its glory I guess.  Soup, rice, side veggies, were all just ok, not great.  Service:  hate to say it, you know you will get less stellar service when the server speaks Mandarin vs Cantonese in a busy place like this.  Anyone who visited China's big cities would attests to this fact:  authentic Cantonese restaurant has higher quality management control vs all the other Chinese groups through out China.  Service was ok but not fitting for a big seafood house like this."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here forever and finally got a chance back in August...  I wasn't very impressed with this place.   We decided on the two-person king crab combo and it definitely was NOT meant for two people. I almost died of a food coma...and ended up packing up a lot of the food. The crab wasn't that good to be honest-- every dish was uninspired and pretty much tasted like more of the same thing. Crab Harbour in Richmond Hill was 100% better. Also the staff weren't very honest with us and tried to sell us a really oversized king crab and we had to refuse it twice before they finally \"magically\" found us a reasonably-sized one.    This meal just left a bad taste in my mouth (literally).. don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"7.5 lbs HK style lobster (spicy fried fish n fried garlic)! Plus roe fried rice, snow peas, and fried garlic beef for less than $200 for 6-8 ppl. Not bad.   Also there's a box of plastic gloves to use so it's easier to eat and your hands don't get dirty."}
{"text":"I've been here for a lot of times. Today, however, was the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant. I will definitely not go back. We ordered the lobster mountain, and quarter way of eating it, we found a fried hair stuck the lobster. And the manager came and saw we are almost half of the lobster(we ordered 16lb), and he said he will cook another 7or8 lb of lobsters for us. And we got another 7 lb of lobsters. At the end, they ask us to pay 16 lb(1 lb cost $18.99). I know we didn't measure the actual weight of the lobster remained we can't really argue with it, but we end up waiting 30 more minutes in that place. And we tried to negotiate with a good attitude and normal tone. However, the owner, a lady, came by with the most contemptuous and arrogant attitude and yelled: \"That's what you gonna pay! You take the rest of the lobsters or leave it\", like it was our fault. We got really pissed. I really regret that I did not take a picture of that lobster with hair. Because the manager came and just dumped the lobster without even looking at it, behaved like trying to destroy the evidence and try to trick us with verbal commitments. It is so disappointing and sad to see a restaurant treating their customers like s**t. To be honest, I really wanted to punch that lady in the face because she was acting like a dog barking at us despite that fact that there were still other customers eating in the restaurant and knowing that she was the boss the restaurant. Her behaviour was very irresponsible and aggressive like we were trying to take the meal for granted. I'm giving 1 star only because there's no 0 star option."}
{"text":"When you walk in, the first thing you see are these large tanks filled with ginormous lobsters and crabs. I've never seen so many, let alone such big crustaceans in my life! We had made a reservation about a month in advance so we were seated right away. Once you select your order, your server will come out and try to up sell you to a bigger lobster and crab and usually, it works haha...at least it did for us. Every dish was so good and fresh!! My favorite was the mountain of lobster. The little fried fishies that came on the dish were soo yummy, especially with the rice.   I think the price was well worth it. With 8 people, we spent about $60 USD each which is not bad at all. CASH ONLY!! This was a great experience and I will definitely come back when I am in the Toronto area again."}
{"text":"Hygiene alert! There was a piece of human hair in our lobster dish. The manager kept insisting that it was fish hair (yeah right) and wouldn't apologize. The food itself was awesome, really enjoyed our HK style lobster until the hair was found in our food. I didnt expect a hint of human hair flavour in our food. The owner ended up apologizing and took care of the bill but the manager never bothered to apologize even after the owner saw it and acknowledged that it was human hair! At least the owner knows how to run the place but clearly not the manager who barely speaks any English. Very unpleasant experience, will not return."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. To quote my husband, \"I think I've eaten and gone to heaven\"   Seems a little dramatic. This place is great for families. Every table is round. Bring your mom, dad, kids, sister, brother, cousins, aunt and uncle. Bring your friends. Tell your friends.   Ok now enough of my ranting.. onto me telling you all about the good food. We did the set 4 lobster and crab with the other fixings. So good. Canto style with good wok hey? Check. Fresh seafood with plenty of meat? Check. Did we see the raw moving creatures pre-cooking? Check. Did the kids enjoy eating the food even though they aren't adventurous? Check.   I'll let the picture tell the story."}
{"text":"I am so surprised that this restaurant is in business - kitchen and dining are both so dirty and so not hygienic. My parter and I had the lobster with pepper, garlic and soy sauce and the shark fin soup. Not only did we wait an hour and a half in line but the food was oily and not tasty at all!!! The bill was $230 for 2. If you ever tasted good seafood before, definitely do not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"- RESERVATIONS ARE A MUST - CASH OR CANADIAN DEBIT CARD ONLY - BE PREPARED FOR ADDITIONAL CHARGES (you will never be able to just pay for the menu price)  The food here is amazing and definitely worth the hype.  We made reservations early to ensure we get a table since we were driving in from Chicago.  We ate here two nights in a row because we really wanted to try the various dishes.  Unfortunately, they didn't have any king crab when we got there, so we had to eat lobster two nights in a row.  The first night we had the lobster mountain for four people and the second night we had the lobster entrees for four people.  The food was fresh and delicious.  They also give you gloves to use to not dirty your hands. The service was very nice and friendly, but the biggest beef I had with this restaurant were the random charges they would add to our bill.  I was already aware this place was cash or debit card only.  It wasn't a problem.  The first night they added extra money for the lobster being 1lb over weight, which was fine, but made no sense.  They charged us close to $30, but their menu stated $19/lb.  We didn't make a fuss and paid the amount.  The second night it was a cheaper menu and again they tacked on $20 or so for the lobster being over weight.  Again, they told us ahead of time, but the price is just random.  They ended up adding 10%+ for tax or whatever this charge was for that we didn't have the first night. We asked the manager and they said it was for taxes, but it wasn't on the receipt or the check they gave us. Again, just some random amount to boost up the total bill.  Just be prepared coming here that you will NEVER pay the price that is on the menu and there will always be additional charges they try to add on to your bill.  Be careful."}
{"text":"This is one of the best seafood restaurants in Markham. My dad brought our family out for dinner to celebrate the new year. He knows the owner as he built all the fish tanks. Restaurant is nice where all the walls were fish tanks. We had 3 lobster dishes, 2 king crab dishes, 3 bass dishes, sweet and sour pork, seafood fried rice, snow crab legs, soup etc. Each dish did not disappoint!! Would really recommend this place for those seafood lovers. Definitely would be a place to come back to! My nephew loves the place as well; he also would rate this 5 s"}
{"text":"Lunch Specials always the way to go!   I haven't been back for years after my initial visit. But since I have some out of town friends visiting, we decided to have lunch at the new location of Fishman Lobster.  Lobster Mountain?! $17/lb for a 4-6 lb lobster is good enough to feed 4 people. Pretty reasonable as with tax and tips comes out to be $25 pp.  Ended up my friend from out of town did not make it. And me and another girl got to eat that whole lobster. It was good but a little too much. We did finish the whole lobster and packed the lobster roe fried rice and vegetables to go.  It did taste a little boring after eating the same thing for awhile. I would suggest get a combination of different preparation options which would have make the experience a little more interesting.   The new restaurant is a lot more spacious and looks pretty nice. Glad that they are doing well and willing to expand.  BTW, $3800 XO Cognac to go with all these seafood? I don't even realize that cognac is good pairing with any seafood?!"}
{"text":"a all 5 star seafood restaurant. We ordered king crabs and lobsters. Omg they were so good"}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day. We came for lunch and they have a really good deal for $15/lb of lobster with fried rice and a dish of veggies. Since my family is rather small, we only got 4lbs.  My family loves HK style lobster and this did not disappoint. It was so good!! There was so much meat and they also provide you with gloves so it is easy to eat without getting your hands all dirty. There was so much food that my family had to take alot of it home.  The service is good too. They show you the lobster before they cook it and they were constantly replacing the dirty plates for clean ones. from reading other Yelp reviews, I already knew there was an 18% tip included in the bill but the waitress was constantly assuring is that we do not need to pay more for extra too. Overall, we thought that their lunch combo was a good deal for the price we paid for. It was around $82 and with leftovers it was an amazing deal. Will probably come back again for lunch again."}
{"text":"I came here recently for the first time with my family to see if this place was worth the hype. Their specialty is seafood, specifically lobster and crab. The whole concept is kind of interesting, since basically the dining area is surrounded by tanks filled with huge lobsters and crabs, so it is a neat experience. Although we had 5 people, we ordered the Fried Lobster Dinner for 3 people, which came with a deep fried lobster with dry garlic, 4 lbs. It also came with a steamed flounder, vegetables, and oysters if I remember correctly. We also added a lobster roe fried rice.  At 4 lbs, our lobster was definitely considered one of the smaller ones, but the dish was still piled pretty high when it came out and we had tons of leftovers. I would definitely say they underestimate the amount of food that comes with each of the set meals, so that is something to keep in mind.  The lobster though was actually really, really, really good. It was just lightly fried, and mixed so well with the garlic so that it was slightly salty and slightly sweet in the most satisfying way with just these wonderful bursts of flavour. If you are a fan of seafood then I mean... you have to come here, it's what they do best, and they are damn good at it. I'm not a huge steamed fish fan so I don't have too much to say about that, but at least it tasted fresh. For some reason their steamed vegetables were also inexplicably delicious.  This place is definitely a little pricier than most other Chinese restaurants - our set meal was $138 and I think after everything we came close to $200. Although I had a great first experience here and would more than willingly come back, I can't see myself coming back too often unless I have an occasion to celebrate. The fact is, unlike a regular Chinese restaurant where you might try lots of different things from the menu, here you feel obligated to stick to seafood and seafood only, and either lobster or crab are a must, so maybe your options are a little limited. That being said, great food, would definitely come again given the chance."}
{"text":"The staff don't speak too much English but the message can be made. Hong Kong style lobster is A MUST!!! I dream about this dish on a regular basis.   This place has been very busy every time I go. Call ahead and see what the wait time is like."}
{"text":"Kuidaore Chinese Style! This place is a must see for all seafood aficionados. From the moment you walk in, you are bombarded with fish tanks filled with Giant King Crabs. I counted over 240 tanks.   Dishes are served Hong Kong style and place gets packed. Reservations are highly recommended. Prices can run high, so bring plenty of cash since credit cards are not accepted. Shark Fin Soup was good with nice chunky fin and oyster dish were both good. The Hong Kong styled fried lobster was exceptional but the real star of the meal was the King Crabs. Try it either fried or steamed, both are excellent. Finish of the meal with a nice black sesame soup dessert! Beware of Food Coma after meal! Zzzzzzzzz..time for nap!"}
{"text":"Had the lobster lunch special good for 2ppl with rhe steamed lobster,rice and veggies and added up to less than $90 with tips included. They also gave us black bean dessert afterwards so it was a nice bonus"}
{"text":"I've never seen a mountain tall of lobster tails in my life until I paid this restaurant a visit. The lobster quality was excellent!! My husband and I ordered their special combo for 2 people that came with shark fin soup, abalone with veggies, 5 lbs of live lobsters cooked in house special sauce. The combo also came with a delicious 2 people portion of black sesame dessert. The lobster portion was ridiculous ! And of course everything was soooo fresh and flavorful! If the food is not amazed you enough, take a look at the walls around the restaurant. There are literally lobster tanks everywhere on every piece of wall one could imagine! We came to this restaurant on a normal Monday night at 9pm, but it was still so packed and there was a line! Amazing restaurant! Highly recommended!!   Cons: pricey! Be prepared to spend $$"}
{"text":"We ordered 6lbs lobsters,  1 crab, abalone with some vegetable and few other dishes. Overall one of the best lobster and crab dishes in town. I can understand why it's so busy.  The seafood was all very well executed the lobster and crab was perfectly cooked. We also ordered steamed fish which was slightly under done cause it was a little difficult getting some of the meat off the bone.  But it was still good.  The service was awful. The servers need an attitude adjustment and it's the John Cena type! Just poor service from beginning to end. I guess that's why they automatically added the service charge to our bill.  4/5 star just for the food  -5/5 for service."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! My family and I came here for a christmas/new years family dinner and we got 3 lobster dishes, 2 king crab dishes, snow crab legs, 3 green bass dishes, fried rice, sweet and sour pork some veggies.  Ordering all those  was like eating at a seafood buffet...specifically a lobster and crab buffet. I'm pretty sure my macros are unbalanced after this delightful dinner and I think it's well worth it.   Service was good as they kept coming to replace our dishes every 10 minutes, along with new cups, replenishing our drinks and making sure our area was as clean as possible. Staff was very friendly and helpful throughout the dinner.   We also dined with the Dragon King, as he had put up the tanks throughout the restaurant, keeping the seafood fresh and tasty. Definitely the first thing you'll notice when coming into this restaurant. By the way, if you are in the area, you should check out Dragon King, who makes top of the line tanks and filters.   Anyways, back to the review... I have nothing bad to say about the food. I had a great experience and will be back again"}
{"text":"When someone deserves 5 stars... they REALLY have to impress me.  However, this place, I am beyond impressed!  The size of the portions of what you get are extremely reasonable.  YOU WILL... take A LOT of food home, as leftovers.  Though, when you get home, you will \"sneak in\" a couple of more tasty bites of your leftovers before putting it into the fridge.  Though, after a few minutes, for safe measure, you take it out of the fridge again... to taste and enjoy the flavors of your dishes of choice. The atmosphere, the people, the selection... you can't get better than this.   Again, the prices are reasonable.   Your mouth will drool as you see the tables around you, and what the people are ordering.  You will say I wanna try that, but over there, that dish looks tasty too... oh wait!  What is that table eating?  The servers will be happy to tell you.  Point, they will be glad you are interested in what you are seeing.   I am like a lost kid in a candy store.  I see so many good choices, but you know you can only have so much.  I can't wait to go again... and again and again. Seriously, this place is just amazing!"}
{"text":"Very stable restaurant, in terms of taste of the food, service, environment. Many photos already explained what they are good at. I will recommend to go to place with a party of 5-8.  First of all, their portion of seafood is huge, they don't carry lobster or king crabs under 5 pounds, so it's good to share; too big of party will feel the crowdedness of the restaurant, the tables are too close to each other. Price wise expect around $80 per person."}
{"text":"This place is pricey, but they give you huge crab and lobster for sure. We got the HK style crab, which has a little spice to it and the dry garlic lobster. I'd say I'd like to try the steamed style next time because the fried style has too much batter for my liking. The lobster was especially delicious though. I'd splurge a little more and get the king crab next time instead of the vancouver crab. Aside from that, the turbot was good and so were the snow pea leaves. The only downside is that you pay through the nose for the food here."}
{"text":"This place is really good it's not often you'll get to eat fresh live king crab most places get them frozen and what's cool is they bring your the \"catch\" before they cook it so you can take photos and see the weight of the lobsters or king crab,food came fast we ordered the 10-12 people meal which includes soup of the day,2 lobsters (hk style & dry garlic style),king crab,fried oysters,2 steamed fish,sweet & sour pork,beef with veggies,lobster roe fried rice & dessert its ALOT of food even though it serves 10-12 people still ended up with a ton of left overs.  Overall the food is amazing HK style lobster has a sweet taste to it mildly spicy which is really good btw  Price: you're looking to spend anywhere between $100+ up to $800+ in our case but the food is just worth it, this is a place you come once in a while"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place after eating here once, they serve one of the freshest seafood in Scarborough. I do not think you can find anywhere else that serve such good Asian style seafood, this restaurant is on the pricey side, but you will not regret going to this place.  The atmosphere is like any other Chinese restaurant, but more fancy. When I am in there I feel like I am underwater snorkeling because the whole restaurant is surrounded by water tanks full of Lobsters, King Crab, Dungeness Crabs, and fishes.  The food is really good, and each seafood dish you order taste fantastic because it is all fresh. The portion is huge, a combo for 2-3 people can actually fill 4-5 people. Do your research before going, and I recommend read a lot of the comments on Yelp, to assist you with the menu selection.   One crazy thing about this place is they have so many menus with combo, and it gets really confusing if they do not explain. If I was to go to this restaurant with my western friends, I would be really clueless because I do not read Chinese. And the names of each dish sound weird, so I would not know what to order. I only came to this place with my family, because they know what is worth it. So tag along with your Asian friends that know Chinese, or have the background knowledge of the menu. Overall, I like it here and I enjoy it every time I visit.   Service: 3/5 Food: 4/5 Environment: 4/5  Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"Love the lobster mountains, lots of good seafood must come with a group of friend or family or else you won't be able to finish"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 if I could, so it was down to either a 3 or a 4, but since I'm basing it on the foods, I think 3 is more accurate then a 4.  I went on my honeymoon in May and this was on the list as a must go.  I watched the YouTube videos, I saw the lobster mountain.  However, I read the reviews and was skeptical about it but decided to go with my husband and two of our friends.  First impression, I have never seen so many clean tanks with lobsters and crabs.  It was pretty amazing sitting in there looking at all the tanks.  Now down to the foods, we ordered the lobster crab dinner for 4, which really can feed 8.  I don't need to go into the details of the dishes since everyone know their 3 ways crabs, the hk style lobster, soup, veggie, etc.... I don't think the flavoring was very good. The crab tower and the hk lobster taste exactly the same, it had that salty msg taste to it.  I'm from Austin and I can tell you my local Chinese restaurant does hk lobsters better.  Would I go back? No. Should you go if you have never been, maybe.  But when you go, think of it as the experience itself with some mediocre foods."}
{"text":"If you're a seafood lover like I am then you will love this place.  Just make sure you also bring your wallet cus it is quite pricey.  What's so amazing about this place????  Maybe it's the super sized lobster and crab that they supply and what they do with it after.  This is the only restaurant I have seen so far that does a lobster tower.  Can you imagine a lobster tower?!!!  You will probably get seafood meat sweats after consuming all the seafood in this place but it's totally worth it in my books.  A great seafood place in Scarborough and a must try if you're in the area!!!!"}
{"text":"Still the best place to get lobster in the GTA, served many different ways. The restaurant moved locations since I last reviewed. The restaurant is much roomier, with lots of tables, and a lot more fish tanks along the walls. The food is still just as good, and they manage to include the little fried fish in everything from the lobster to the congee. It's still busy here on the weekends, but it's much easier to get a table."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant using yelp...  For dinner, the (4-5 lbs) lobster was brought to the table prior to being cooked... mine weighed 4.63 lbs.  About half was fried and the other half steamed.  A basic and classical Chinese bone broth soup was served first, followed by the lobster, rice in broth, and large dish of veggie (I think the veggie was baby choy sum).  The meal was concluded with what I believe to be an almond paste dessert.  Overall a very good no frills seafood restaurant that is extremely casual."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to see what the hype was all about. Mountains of crispy crab and lobster have been popping up all over my social media. I can honestly say that it tastes just as good as it looks. It is a fairly large venue with over 90 tables. I'd definitely recommend coming here with an army of hungry soldiers. It is a bit on the expensive side but well worth the experience! Perfect for celebrations. Service was extremely slow at the start but picked up rather quickly after they took our order. My only complaint is that we reserved a table for 8pm but they had us wait until 8:45... Overall it was a good experience and I would definitely come back when my wallet stops dieting. We got the 688$ special that supposedly feeds 8-10 but in actuality, you could probably feed 12-15 people. The special includes  -soup of the day -2 gigantic lobsters (25-27lb total weight) -3 crabs fried Hong Kong style -3 steamed bass -snow pea leaves with goji berries -fried rice with lobster roe -bottle of white wine -cashew soup dessert"}
{"text":"I love Seafood's of all kinds esp. crabs and lobsters. This restaurant is a MUST go place for everyone. As seafood lover, I can't thank enough to the chefs who were efficient and professional in preparing the \"cuisines\" for us. The services of the servers are a good team and very friendly and caring. Price is also reasonable. When you compare the cuisine with other culture, this one is not expensive at all. It costs about $80-$100 per person all inclusive. I also live the decor of this place. Very stunning when you walk in. Felt like I was eating best foods in the aquarium. Thank you to everyone at Fishman Seafood."}
{"text":"Really good lobster, however this place is always completely full of people and you must make reservation. Otherwise be prepared for 2-hours wait. And also, the service here is okay but definitely not the best since they are always super busy."}
{"text":"Great place for seafood and big groups. They have combos depending on how many people are in your party. Price ends up being about 50-60 per person but definitely worth it.  They give you gloves to eat the seafood which was very helpful. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh man this place was AHHHHHmazing. We had the combo with HK lobster and some sort of sweet garlic sauce on the crab legs. We had corn soup (not my favorite and wouldn't waste my appetite on that). They also have black chicken soup which I highly ADVISE AGAINST. It's literal BLACK chicken in a soup with other stuff and when they stir it looks like a crow in the bowl. I gag thinking about it and gagged at the time. Leave that for people who understand and appreciate what this is (usually the authentic Chinese visitors).   Otherwise, everything else was to die for. It's very expensive but can feed an army.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was an expensive meal but worth it. We had seafood combo for 4 people; consisted of king crab, lobsters, veggies, soup, and fried rice. I think the combo was $280ish; but you usually have to pay extra for the lobsters and crabs as they weight more than the set combo. The meal ended up costing us $400 after the extra lbs, taxes, and tips. Roughly $100 per head which is not bad as we had a lot of fresh seafood.  The king crab was prepared in several different styles: deep fried, steamed, and in fired rice. Lobster was very flavourful, however I preferred the king crab. The deep fried garlic chips tasted amazing!!! My hubby took the leftover garlic chips home and put them in home-made fried rice the next day.....yummy! Overall it was a fun and delicious meal. Will definitely return one day on special occasion or when I want to treat myself"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the lunch combo for two $35.99.  You get steamed lobster, scallop congee, fried rice vermicelli with vegetable and black sesame soup dessert.  Well, I'm used to having a good tasty congee.  This scallop congee is bland salt less and the head waiter said that this is how scallop congee is prepared.  That you will not taste the scallop and we were given bottles of salt and pepper for us to add salt on it.  Lobster is perfectly prepared.  Not to crazy about the black sesame soup dessert.  Oh yes, their fried rice vermicelli has bits and pieces of crunchiness.  It's something different.  Will be back."}
{"text":"My sister had be raving about this place and asked me to go.  It was really good.  It is definitely worth the money.  There are several different menus with many varieties and many price points.  We had a set menu that include 20lbs lobsters, oysters, steamed fish soup and wine.  The lobster is the best part of course.  It was a mountain of lobster that was at least a half a metre high.  It was on a bed of fried baby anchovies, so good!  Definitely making it a traditional to come here at least once a year!"}
{"text":"overall im a fan and would definitely come back.  Pretty cool to see Susur Lee eat at the table beside me.  pros  - picture worthy (before and after photos of the food) - tastes pretty amazing - presentation  - garlic overload - surrounded by fish tanks  cons - garlic farts after - price - parking is horrendous - washroom has only ice water temperatures to wash your hand like punishment."}
{"text":"So far my favourite place to go for lobster! The first time I went here was for Valentine's Day with my husband. We ordered the Dinner for two special, which came with shark fin soup, braised abalone, steamed broccoli with shredded meat and of course the 5 pound Hong Kong Style lobster. I've had shark fin soup before from other restaurants, but this one tasted the best! It's very flavourful, and they give you chunks and pieces of the shark fin. The broccoli was good! It was my first eating abalone and I really enjoyed it! My favourite of course was the lobster! The flavour was amazing!! It had a little bit of spice to it which I loved! I loved the tiny fried fish at the bottom of the tower, it was garlicky and crunchy!  Love this restaurant, been going there at least once a month since February! Highly recommend this place If you're craving some good quality lobster or crab!"}
{"text":"I came for the lobsters but the snow crab stole my heart.  Honestly think it's great bang for your buck. Super tender  and moist, a natural sweetness. I would come back to this place again and again."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday evening at 6:30pm for my dad's birthday. The restaurant was packed and we were lucky to get a table without making a reservation.   The food came fairly quickly and my parents loved it. As people who can't have much sodium in their diet due to health reasons, my parents didn't once complain about the food and were actually very pleased with how little salt was used in our food.   It is fairly pricey ($220 after tax and tip for 4 people - this is one of the lower priced options) but it's worth it if you're coming to celebrate a birthday and have some fresh seafood and good Chinese food.   *forgot to take a pic of the dessert but this is what our option consisted of."}
{"text":"When you need to pick the restaurant for celebration, where would you go? I have been drooling  over all the food pics from this restaurant for many years and finally found the reason to go  Liked that all the dishes were lightly seasoned. Their fried rice was just done right. Loved the clear broth of black chicken soup. Steamed Bass was cooked perfectly. So for our main dishes... lobster two ways( HK style mountain with lots of anchovies & ginger green onion ) It was fun to look at but I still think simple steamed lobster with butter dipping is the best to eat lobster."}
{"text":"No doubt this is a five stars restaurant for the food however, the 3 stars is for the attitude of the restaurant.  They know right away that we are not local so they said either cash or Canadian debit card.  When the bill came, they tag on 10% to the bill and charge us extra for the seafood ( because the crab n lobster weighted more than what the combo meal listed).  The rude part was the server was staring at us when we were counting the money for the bill.  Just be prepare for that if you are not from around there.  Reservation is recommended."}
{"text":"This is one of the best seafood restaurants in Markham. My dad brought our family out for dinner to celebrate the new year. He knows the owner as he built all the fish tanks. Restaurant is nice where all the walls were fish tanks. We had 3 lobster dishes, 2 king crab dishes, 3 bass dishes, sweet and sour pork, seafood fried rice, snow crab legs, soup etc. Each dish did not disappoint!! Would really recommend this place for those seafood lovers. Definitely would be a place to come back to! My nephew loves the place as well; he also would rate this 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We thought this place tasted good but hygiene is questionable.  We found 3 back short hairs steamed with our fish and deep fried with our lobster."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! There are many restaurants trying to serve up lobsters/seafood like this but the presentation and taste is the best! You can have one lobster cooked several ways and they all taste great!  Their other seafood dishes are delicious as well."}
{"text":"Is this place expensive? Depends on what you mean.  If I get excellent quality lobster combined withe excellent service what kind of a price would you put to that?  For $180 for a combo including a big armed lobster with salted fish garnish, steamed sea bass, snow pea leaves with gogi berries, dried scallop fried rice and a couple of pop.  Tips included.  For a group of six people,   This is pretty much a steal we even had to take stuff home.  Service was phenomenal.  I didn't have to ask much except for water and things just kept coming in.  Even photo support.  I'll be coming in here again soon for a friend's birthday party as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place  Price: family style dinner will run a few hundreds but it is for seafood so actually the price is pretty good  Service: best Asian service I have ever received. Lets be honest Asians restaurant is notorious for poor service. But this place is wicked awesome. Eating in the service is prompt and fantastic. They offered us free drinks once cause they had to switch our tables so that we wont be cold near the door. Another time I got takeout lobsters for sisters bday and the manager helped me carry the food to my car. I thought I was in a white restaurant like Scarmouche...was so surprised Asians service is stepping it up.  Food: why must they make me fat?! Soooo fuckin' good. Delicious. My all time favorite is the lobsters w fried garlic...drools. Their other dishes are really tasty too ie: soups, fried rice etc. Would come back for more definitely  Atmosphere: tables are so close together making it a bit uncomfortable.  Absolutely recommends this place."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place 3 stars is because of the service, the ambiance and the language barrier. But the food is awesome!! Love the lobster roe fried rice and the Singaporean lobster!!!"}
{"text":"Not all that it cracked up to be. We were a party of 15 and they crammed us into a table only for 12 tops. We couldn't move from our seats and kept getting knocked by the people next to us.  The worst of the experience is the way they trick you into getting bigger cuz they don't have the exact weight offered in the combos. when the bill comes all in Chinese and only one person can explain to us what it says.   As for the food. There was a lot of bland tasting food. Quite ordinary, the food doesn't go with the presentation. Looks good but nothing special in the taste. Tips was automatic 10% but service did not warrant that amount.   We all agreed we have had better food at OMEI. The restaurant is really busy but I think it's just for the presentation. That's my opinion. Not satisfying for the money. Our bill was over 1 grand and none of us felt satisfied.   Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Amazing experience here.  *CASH ONLY OR DEBIT* however, they were not willing to take our US debit card.  WAIT: My friend made reservations for 4 of us about a week in advance for a Sunday 8pm seating.  I hear that you almost always need a reservation and I would assume coming with a larger group is preferred.  Almost everyone there had a huge table of 8-10 people.  LOCATION: It's a little far for those coming to Toronto because the nearest subway stop is probably Finch and that is about a 15-20 minute drive.  I would suggest coming here by car or having a friend take you.    ATMOSPHERE: Inside it's a pretty typical chinese/asian restaurant with banquet style tables and huge tanks of lobsters and crabs for you to see. The people there speak mostly cantonese or mandarin so it might be harder to communicate.    FOOD: they have lots of good combos that include their famous lobster mountain.  For 4 of us we went with the combo that comes with lobster, soup, fish, veggies and dessert.  In hindsight we could have gone with a smaller combo since there was food leftover.    LOBSTER COMBO - I forget the exact name of it but I believe the standard is  5 lbs of lobster, they bring you the lobster to view before they cook it and they always try to upsell you by bringing out a bigger one.  We ended up going with 5.8 lbs.  They deep fry it Hong Kong style meaning it has a crispy tempura like batter with salt, a slightly spicy seasoning and tons of garlic chips.  The lobster comes out in a huge stacked mountain with lettuce on top and then these little fried fishes on the bottom that looked like crispy wonton skins at first.  They do have eyes if that freaks you out.  The lobster is really easy to eat and get the meat out, it has so much juice, flavor and overall freshness. Wasn't rubbery or too chewy.   The other dishes like the soup, sea bass and veggies were a good side to help open the stomach and give you a break from the lobster but the highlight was the lobster.  Oh! They also give you gloves to use when you're eating like at boiling crab.  Overall, a great experience not only seeing the huge lobster mountain but also enjoying the delicious meat of the lobster!"}
{"text":"LOBSTER MOUNTAIN!!! This place is the place to go if you're feeling like spending a couple bills and craving Chinese style lobster. My table of six ordered the (G) Special King Crab Dinner and we substituted the lobster with dry garlic with lobster in Maggi sauce instead. Best decision ever. The crab and lobster were incredibly tasty and definitely over the top with how much food there is but you get what you pay for.   The soup of the day was a salty disappointment. Cream of corn? Really? Besides that, the deep fried oysters, snow peas, fried rice, and steamed green bass were pretty standard. We got the black sesame sweet soup as dessert too. Wasn't a huge fan of it but my family really enjoyed it. One thing I have to say is that this meal left an enormous aftertaste in my mouth due to the amount of MSG in their food that left me thirsty for hours. Pretty typical for a Chinese restaurant though so I still think the lobster mountain deserves a 4 star. Make sure to reserve a few days in advance or you'll be stuck eating at off hours!"}
{"text":"So my family was visiting from Florida and I live in Montreal. BUT... we HAD to drive all the way to this place so we could try it ourselves. Almost killing each other along the way (we're very opinionated people), this place lived up to the hype. My little sister really wanted THE lobster tower. Now keep in mind that we were 4 small Vietnamese humans with one skinny white American man (brother-in-law). There was sooooo much food. More then we could handle. We got the combo I:  -Daily soup -Steamed bass -16lbs lobster (we got 17) -8lbs king crab (we got 7) 3 way which included fried rice -snow pea tips -some soupy dessert -bottle of white wine but switched to four beers  I really enjoyed everything I had! The service was very good. Almost every waiters were courteous except one. It wasn't her day lol."}
{"text":"Only place your can enjoy 16lb of Lobster with a HK cooking style for this seafood disk"}
{"text":"We went there for a birthday, the lobster tower is impressive and yummy! I agree with the previous comments, some picks or those pliers to break the claw pieces are in order. It was messy and funny, though,  to try and eat some spinach with the chopsticks or drink beer with the slippery gloves... The service was good, they include 10% tip in the bill, which is ok with me. The desert was a letdown, something called cashew cream had a consistency and taste of bad baby cereal."}
{"text":"This place is definitely overrated and overpriced. The power of social media and the photos of the crazy lobster tower has benefitted this restaurant well. Came here for a family dinner with relatives visiting from Hong Kong. The decoration inside the restaurant was very typical Asian Chinese style. The presentation of the live sea creatures around the walls were impressive. The atmosphere was quite exciting, seeing all these people taking pre and post pictures of their chosen seafood. The servers at the restaurants even allow patrons to pick up the live crustaceans for a photo op.  Now onto the food, the presentation of the seafood was definitely the highlight of the night. It took two waiters to carry out the massive lobster mountain which was nicely assembled. It was very sturdy and did not come crashing down as pieces were being pulled out. Taste wise, nothing amazing, tasted the same as most Chinese restaurant prepped lobster. The crab legs were on the bland side.  At the end of the night, the bill came up to around $1,700 for 13 people. For that kind of price, there could have been so many better options. Overall, won't be coming back. The price of the seafood was not worth it at all."}
{"text":"The lobster mountain was outrageous! And I mean that in a good way. 4 adults, 1 teenager and a child were determined to demolish a lobster mountain. Unfortunately we underestimated the amount of lobster that was involved and only got through half of the mountain.   I had read a few reviews about the staff trying to upsell you and low and behold, the lady was skeptical that we were 'only' ordering 15 lbs and asked if we wanted 25 lbs instead. We held firm in our decision and were so glad we didn't go with her suggestion.   Silly us thinking that lobster wouldn't be enough ordered a lobster fried rice as well. We barely touched the rice and ended up playing rock, paper, scissors to determine who would have the last of the veggies.   I definitely recommend this restaurant to seafood lovers. Just make sure you order accordingly so that you won't be eating leftovers for a while."}
{"text":"Tip: cash or debit only. They added tip before bringing the bill over, set at 10%. You can add more if you like.   Came here with my sisters and friend. After seeing pictures of dishes here, I had to give this place a try. The combo with got was $368( feeds 4 ppl), which comes with shark fin soup (4), abalone (4), bass (1.5 lbs), veggie with bits of ham, lobster (6lbs), crab (2.25 lbs), and dessert. We had plenty of left over, and honestly, it feeds more like 5-6 ppl.  I'm not a shark fin or abalone girl but my friend never had it before and my youngest sister loves it so we went with this combo. The best part for me was the crab. It was coated in salted egg yolk and fried. The lobster was cooked Hong Kong style. I'm a little bias here. I've always had lobster cooked with ginger and scallion and this will always be my preferred way. I never had it Hong Kong style and was excited to give it a try. It wasn't that flavorful to me and it was a bit overcooked because the lobster was a bit tough. My sister who never likes bass praised it, and it was good. It was fresh and no fishy taste. The most disappointing dish was the veggie. Poach and topped with very little bits of ham."}
{"text":"Father's Day Yelp Review.  My good friend Johnny (Foodie & Yelper) had recommended this Scarborough gem, since finding out my love for seafood. I made reservations Tuesday, in anticipation that the restaurant would be packed on the weekend (as per Yelp Tips), and indeed the restaurant was packed!   Fishman Lobster Clubhouse is decently sized, not small but not large either. Wall-to-wall there are fish tanks filled with shell fished critters. We're seated in the middle of the restaurant, under one of the two intricate chandeliers (definitely a staple to Chinese restaurants) and we're given 5 different menus. After a quick glance, we decide on the \"Large Lobster Dinner for 6\" ($228) , dishes include:  -Congee -Deep Fried Lobster w/ Dry Garlic (6lbs) -Steamed Eel w/ Orange Peel -Fried Crab Hong Kong Style (2.5lbs) -Oyster w/ Ginger and Green Onion (6pcs) -Sea Bass (1.5 lbs)  -Poached Snow Pea Tips w/ Wolf Berry  Before all the dishes started rolling out, our server brought out the unsuspecting victim...a solid 6 and a half pound lobster. To commemorate the occasion we snapped some pics of dad & lobster.   I've only ever had eel BBQ style, so it was a treat getting to try steamed eel! The meat was steamed and seasoned perfectly - the bone is left in, so be cautious when eating.    The HK style deep fried crab (Vancouver crab) followed shortly after...it is presented like a game of Jenga, with what I thought were deep fried onions but to my joyous surprise - fried Whitebait; essentially baby fish.   I am an oyster fanatic! I love and appreciate a raw oyster, but gawd damn the ginger and green onion oyster dish Fishman serves up is amazing! The oyster is deep fried- crispy outside, juicy inside. Personal favourite, and will order  during future visits.    The main of mains arrives at the table, and quickly overshadows (literally) the other dishes. I call it, \"The Lobster Tower\" - a foodie's dream, a lobster's nightmare, and a dish that would make Red Lobster cower. Put away the chopsticks, you're about to get in touch with your inner Neanderthal. Your hands are your best bet to enjoy every piece of fresh lobster meat...disposable gloves are made available for your convenience if you're not stoked to smell of fried shell-fish after.  This dish would be served in the heavens, I'm sure of it.   My family purposefully over ordered, just so we'd have left overs. Maybe a tip if you're like us, travelling from a place like Brampton.  Our lunch concluded with some Chinese dessert- an almond purée I believe? I really don't know, they were speaking Chinese...it tasted nutty.   Overall, I love this place. If you're looking for amazing seafood and authentic Chinese, Fishman Lobster Clubhouse restaurant is the spot.   ***Cash and debit card only***"}
{"text":"We organized 2 tables of 10 people per table.  It was lots of fun and our mountain of lobster was outstanding!  Great presentation with 2 waiters coming out balancing the mountain very carefully and everyone gawked at them like a bride making her grand entrance on her wedding day!  Lol.    The dish was very well prepared with a tasty and spicy lightly breaded coat over the lobsters.  The pieces were also huge!  Our table were all big eaters and we had a little difficulty finishing all 3 lobsters.  So ordering 3 lobsters at 10 lbs each is more than sufficient for a table of 10.  We also ordered fried rice which was cooked with the brains of the lobster.  Super tasty!  Snow pea sprouts was our veggie dish.  Also done very well and cooked with garlic.    This kind of dining is wonderful for social gatherings and definitely Instagram worthy."}
{"text":"Expensive meal but worth it for special occasions! I actually liked the Alaskan crab more than the lobster which was the main dish and center of attention.  Just my preference. Come with a large group since the dishes can be large."}
{"text":"If this was like Instagram I can say @Johnny thanks man  Johnny's friend visited from Miami and they said, \"Let's share lobsters.\" Originally I didn't know what that meant. What?   So we ordered I think 2? lobsters. Plus the fried rice. It was about $30 per person for 10 people. Two dishes!! That's it.   The process: 1) order 2) staff will pick the lobsters in front of you, making sure you approve of them 3) in a SHORT amount of time, the mountain of lobster arrives. It takes two people to lift it to your table!  The lobster mountain is flavourful and surrounded by loads and loads and loads of small tiny fish (deep fried). So you can literally \"dig in\" and scoop handfuls and put them into your mouth. Then get a new glove, or not. Honestly I didn't mind if other people were digging in and making a mess.   The fried rice was delicious!!!!!! I had so much of it. I couldn't decide if my next \"bite\" is going to be the rice or the lobster. Both were equally amazing. It was difficult to choose what to fill my mouth with (hahaha).  I loooooooooooooooooooooooved it. The experience itself, I really want to take my family here. But alas I have no money. And I'd feel bad if they were to pay. Some day."}
