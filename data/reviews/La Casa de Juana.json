{"text":"Awesome bright interior, fantastic service, vegetarian friendly and good atmosphere. I came with a friend for dinner and was definitely impressed. There was even a man playing guitar and singing Spanish love songs. The margs have real fruit and are definitely worth trying. Will be back."}
{"text":"2 Stars for the gorgeous, colorful interior which will no doubt attract customers. With that being said, zero stars for service and food. The waitstaff seems incredibly unfriendly.  The food itself was slightly cold, the tortillas were cold and sub par, like maybe they had used Mission or some other store brand and then rolled them up in foil and then thrown in the microwave. The rice was flavorless and cold as well. The cheese on the refried beans had cooled over as well. The quesadillas were also plastic tasting.   The interior is fun and inviting, but it doesn't make up the food. This is a bummer, because I really wanted to like this place its just so creative on the inside, but the snooty waitresses and the cold, boring food is not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"I'm quite particular when it comes to Mexican food. Having grown up in Phoenix, I've been exposed to a lot of Mexican food both good and bad. This is my first time visiting and I do plan to go back. The server seemed almost scared of me, which was weird. She was very nice and polite but seems a little timid. I'm sure she'll get over that. Chips and salsa were better than average. I had carnitas tacos and pollo tacos. Chicken was fresh and juicy as we're the carnitas. The server never checked back after I got my food which is a big pet peeve of mine. They are only two months old and I'm sure will continue to work through their growing pains. I'll come back and give them another chance in a month or two to see how they progressed."}
{"text":"We tried their take-out. The food was flavorful, but portions were small, and prices were moderate to high when compared with other Mexican restaurant s. La Casa de Juana is okay, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Ceviche is off the charts...also ordered tamales in salsa roja  with beans and rice this too was fantastic...this was a take out order to watch game by but everyone tasting left me very little...next time I'll order the menudo...an acquired taste...Viva!!!"}
{"text":"great food!! i got the chicken fajitas they were so fresh & not dry at all..salsa was actually hot(loved it) & good service everything was pretty quick! will def be coming back"}
{"text":"If you're looking for real Mexican food, this is NOT the place to go. The people and the d√©cor was good BUT this is not why you come to an \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant. It's the FOOD that keeps people coming back. I ordered a chile relleno with rice and beans on the side. The chile relleno was a disgrace to all Mexican people not to mention the beans and rice. If you're going to call your food \"authentic\" then please look up the meaning of this word. The beans were definitely from a can, the rice was GREEN (who does that?) with no flavor. The chile relleno wasn't even dipped in the egg batter and fried. It was literally a poblano chile (naked) with cheese on top. Worst Mexican food I had in my life. I know, I'm Mexican. I hope this company reads this and steps their game up because the food they serve is crap!!"}
{"text":"The decor is obviously very bright and cheery, couple that with a quaint intimate bar and overall environment, it's very easy to slip into this place and have short lunch or long dinner. I visited on a Friday night, it was a little busy and my only complaint was that it did take a while to get greeted and served chips and salsa and a drink. The menu options are great, very straight forward traditional fare and variety. I had the nachos for an appetizer, home made chips and all the fixings, very good. My main course was chicken enchiladas, the chicken was great. I do prefer shredded chicken and bit more \"soupy\" but that is my preference. I'm also a big fan of onions and those where not in any of items, just in their amazing homemade salsa which I loved. Overall great experience, very close to my home. I plan to be a loyal customer. Nice job Casa de Juana"}
{"text":"Great tacos at a good price. The salsa is amazing as well. What's best is the service, really nice girls! Cheap happy hour margaritas too (3$)"}
{"text":"Good food but the service is what makes it a 2 star. So slow. I've got my food almost cold before. I'm left hanging on my drink refill all dinner. They used to have good servers but I don't know where they all went. Good food horrible service.  Also... stay far away from the fish taco. It was horrible to me. Super dry and didn't really taste too much like fish."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, the food is decent. Seasoned well for what I had (chicken mole and calavasitas). Drink menu is average. Atmosphere is nice and it is spacious. Man but the service is really bad. They are super slow from beginning to end. There is no one to intially greet you and when they do seat you it takes about 10mins before waiter comes and takes drink orders and then bring chips and salsa. Both occasions were not busy. In between each thing that they do it takes quite a while more than a normal sit down eatery of this type, not including food. I don't think I will be returning do to how ridiculously slow the service is. Maybe if the food was amazing but it's pretty normal. Remind you that it was not busy maybe like 6 or 7 tables with 2 waiters and what seemed to be the manager helping out in the front."}
{"text":"Found this gem on yelp and we were not disappointed. The food was great. I would of gave them 5 out of 5 but the margaritas were lacking the tequila. :/ just a suggestion from a customer and will return...but don't use so much sweet and sour or the mix. ;)  But very happy we found this place. Reminds me of home"}
{"text":"My husband and i went right after it opened, it was close to home and had a coupon. The staff was friendly from the moment we walked in! They had a guy singing on guitar that was fabulous, the menu was great too. The salsa was good, not great, margarita was excellent, food was excellent and service was too! Will go back for sure, even without coupon!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and authentic! The rice is not the standard dried out version of Mexican rice, maybe a lime flavor? . Chimis and burritos were meaty and flavorful. Love their salsa, so good we just couldn't get enough of it! Another Server, Hyatt was especially friendly and attentive as was our server. Have to say they serve some of the best Mexican food we have had. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"It was about 10 minutes from the time we were asked how many in our party until the time we turned and walked out. We were never seated. The food smelled great. The service looked to be 2-3 people short. It appeared they had no silverware for our table of five and hence they were not ready to seat us. Hopefully we're just a rare disappointed customer."}
{"text":"Cilantro cream chicken is awesome!  We were there on a Friday night and it was really busy.  The staff had a little trouble keeping up but they did their best."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal, great service. We eaten there three times now with no complaints.  Just finished breakfast including huevos rancheros, breakfast burrito and pancakes and it was all delish!"}
{"text":"I ended up here because Flannys wasnt open yet and I wanted to grab lunch before a movie. It looked like they just opened for the day so I thought everthing would be fresh.  We got a sampler platter that included  a tamale,  2 mini chimis, 2 mini taquitos, and quesadilla .  The food came out cold and tasteless. The guacamole was very dark like it was left over from the prior night.  The guesadilla looked like it had been microwaved. I took one bite of every item and was more disappointed with each. I paid my tab and left.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second chance after ordering cold in the middle mini chimis. This time around soggy quesadilla and a 1$ for a small side of sour cream. Also the strawberry margarita was too sweet with little alcohol. Chips were just ok. Won't be going back again."}
{"text":"I ordered some tamales.  I asked the girl ahead of time and she let me know they make their tamales fresh very morning. I paid $30 for am order of 6 which is extremely over priced. I thought as long as they were good it would be worth it. I brought them home and they were hard. As if they had been frozen for a while.  I was so disappointed.  I over paid for hard tamales. I will never go back there in my life."}
{"text":"Was on a mission to find a new Mexican food spot in the area. Mission accomplished. Salsa was great, has a little kick. They have a chimi special for Friday... they stole my heart/stomach! Paula was our server and I cannot remember the last time I had that kind of fabulous service.. anywhere. Happy hour pricing is offered throughout the restaurant and there was live music. Great spot for a Friday dinner.   I would only recommend a kids menu and maybe some crayons.   Thank you for a great dinner! :)"}
{"text":"HAYATT WAS AMAZING!!! Incredible service, definitely will be coming back because of her!!"}
{"text":"The only complaint is have is that they don't serve beans with their chips and salsa. Other than that everything was great! The food was flavorful and the service was good. Prices are very reasonable. The menu isn't very big but I managed"}
{"text":"We just happened to spot this as we were driving around looking for a mall.  The food was amazing here.  My son and I both ordered the lunch combo plates.  He had two shredded beef tacos and I had the chicken tamale and rellano.  Both were fantastic.  The combo comes with rice and beans.  Coming from California I had never seen a green rice before, or tried anything with a green chile sauce.  Wow.  The sauce is packed with flavor and tastes amazing.  My wife ordered a breakfast burrito and said it was great.  We would definitely come here again the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, just want to try a new Mexican restaurant. We got there around 5:30 was a little crowded,but cleared a table for us right away.  We were there almost 10 min before anyone approached our table.  Took our drink order waited another 5 min to get sodas and chips. The food was good but service took way to long."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place after seeing a movie nearby, what a pleasant surprise! Fun decor, food was delicious...loved the rice with cilantro and poblano chile, the beef chimi was perfect! The complimentary, warm apple empanadas were a great treat! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a great local restaurant run by friendly people. My husband and I come by at least once a week. The decorations are festive and bright. The wait staff is always great. We love their fish tacos, enchiladas, homemade tamales, and chili rellenos. The house margarita is always refreshing. I choose this over Macayo's and La Fonda every time. You get the kind of flavor and attention that just aren't at these bigger restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is awesome- Authentic, authentic, authentic! Beautifully designed and decorated dining area. Delicious and fresh chips/salsa. Great service. Savory food. And serenaded by singer and guitarist.  Perfect way to usher in a weekend or relax/unwind! Already went live on FB to share with friends. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Slow service at lunchtime with only 5 people I can see and two servers. Salsa was mediocre at best. Hot salsa tasted like a foot.  I was not impressed in any aspect of my visit but it's close to my office thought I'd give it a chance. Mistake made. I will not be returning and would rather go to the taco shack then eat here again."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we will be back. The food was some of the best we've had for quite some time. My wife had the cheese enchiladas and I had the creamy cilantro chicken. Plenty of great tasting food and decent prices too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I walked in and fell in love with the decor immediately!  Beautiful and clean!  It was my first time and I eat vegetarian so I was thrilled that they do not use lard or meat products in the refried beans.  The vegetarian menu is huge and delicious!  Service was great and the server was polite, efficient and answered all our questions.  I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"I like to try New Mexican restaurants in the valley area..this place is worth a one time visit..the salsa tasted fresh..house margarita is a waste of money. Chicken tamale was very good..chicken fagitas were average..tortillas were thick and could have been cooked better. Service was good"}
{"text":"In Tempe for Ironman Arizona and decided to check this place out. Staff was very nice, attentive, and cheery.    The food was great and the price was great relative to the portions you receive. Will be back again!  Check out the mix and match enchiladas!!  The rice is mixed with spices that enhance the flavor of the meal."}
{"text":"THIS place is absolutely amazing. We have been hunting for an authentic Mexican food place that meets the standard of homemade food and this please met that. The margaritas are among the best I've had here in the PHX areas. This place is underrated, will be coming back... a lot."}
{"text":"Great Sonoran-style Mexican food.  Go between 3 and 6 for happy hour,  good in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went yesterday during happy hour for our joint Birthday \"linner\". We went mainly to see if it was as bright and authentic looking as the pictures showed. It was the most beautiful place to get Mexican food. Our server was named Hyatt I think and she was The Best. She was like an energizer bunny and multi tasked better than anyone I have seen in a long time. Anyway the service was wonderful, atmosphere great and the food very good too. We are already planning to go again and have told others about it."}
{"text":"When you order the chocolate mini chimis and bite into a BEEF mini that is a big disappointment. Won't other again"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. My co-workers and I love to order delivery through Grub Hub. It takes about 50 minutes but the food is EXCELLENT. Fresh and hot, and the order is always accurate despite our picky eaters' modifications! Some favorites are the mexican pizza with chicken, the chips and salsa, and the green enchiladas. YUM!"}
{"text":"We were first timers here that stopped by on a whim and were very pleased with our choice. Great Happy Hour prices, friendly staff, awesome food. Had Tijuana shrimp and beef tamales, recommend both. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Visiting from CA. Great service. Guacamole was fresh. Enjoyed the talapia fish taco and chile relleno. Both were tasty and not greasy. Yummy mojitos and margaritas. Would visit again if I lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My cousin from Ohio was in town and wanted Mexican food.  I was a bit hesitant to take her to La Casa de Juana because I have had inconsistent service and food there.  I think perhaps they change cooks often, maybe managers too.  Well, last night was totally awesome.  First of all, the music was horribly loud, but when we asked that it be turned down, they did that immediately, even asking if it was turned down low enough.  Afterall, most folks go out to eat to also enjoy conversation. Our waiter was a young newbe, Jesus.  He was fabulous. Very friendly and engaging--we had quite a nice long conversation with him since they weren't busy at all. It's sad that they weren't busy as I so much want the businesses in my neighborhood, the Fiesta District, to do well.  We intentionally came early so we could take advantage of Happy Hour margarita prices. For $3 the margarita was huge and delicious. We enjoyed the chips and salsa which was yummy, different than salsa I've had at any other Mexican food restaurant.  We both ordered the three item plate for dinner. I always want a fish taco, but most restaurants do not give the choice of a fish taco (only beef or chicken) on the specialty plates--guess fish is more costly--so I was really happy to see that.  It was very reasonably priced, only $9.99.  Everything was delicious!  Oh, and the decor is so colorful and fun.  I hope they stay consistently good--I'm ready to go again."}
{"text":"I have made 3 Spring Training trips from Austin, TX and this is by far the best Mexican food I have ever had.   The tamales are on point. Salsa is fresh. Pozole is on point."}
{"text":"Wonderful local find by the theaters.  The d√©cor was beautiful and the food was fantastic.  I love the \"making it your own\" creations on the menu items we tried.  I will be back with friends!!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible! Not to mention, there was a HAIR in my food!!!!GROSS!!!! Then some dude Tony came to the table and acted like a total asshole - he said he would not replace the meal!! He said \"it's just one little hair\" NASTY!!!!"}
{"text":"We were a large family group, and we had a great experience here. The restaurant called us prior to getting there saying we didn't need to rush, they still had customers lingering at the tables for us. That was fantastic. Amy our server was AMAZING! With all the chaos of couples paying separately, but sitting at different tables, she was never once flustered! They offer ribeye as a meat choice which is a nice offering. Haven't seen that before on a menu. Great place!"}
{"text":"We had never tried this place, though it's close by, and I'm so glad we did. The food was delicious, light and fresh. Chicken enchiladas were packed with meat and the green rice with cilantro and bits of vegetable was out of this world. Red sauce a bit fiery for my taste, but the green sauce was just right. The decor is very lively and there was live Mexican music, which my husband and I like on occasion, a friendly server who explained the menu. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Walking up to the restaurant the aroma was amazing and I was excited to finally try this place out. After this experience will keep my old stand by Rosita's.  The food was fair but definitely not good enough to make up for the extremely poor service.  We waited 5 minutes before our waitress appeared to take our drink orders I can't mention her name because she never introduced herself and had no name tag. Our drinks were empty for over 10 minutes before we had to flag her down for refills. A party of 4 and we were there for 2 hours. Our waitress disappeared for about 20 minutes while we waited to order our food. Another 30 minutes for the meals to arrive and it was Luke warm. Flagged the manager down and he acted as if it was an inconvenience. I will never go here again and if asked where to go for good mexican food I will make sure to tell them that this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"Delivery was just as good as if I went there! It came quickly and the man was really polite and nicely dressed. I will definitely order here again soon."}
{"text":"I think we've got a new local favorite! We've been trying out Mexican places in the neighborhood, and this place hits the spot. Service was surprisingly fast. The salsa is fresh and yummy. The chips were crisp and not heavy. My son had a shredded beef chimichanga, which holds it own against even Mi Amigos. I had the steak ranchero, which has a strong kick. My wife had a combo plate with a taco, enchilada, and tamale. The masa was better than most, and the taco was great. We'll be back"}
{"text":"I give La Casa De Juana five stars because they exceeded my expectations several ways. First, the salsa served with the complimentary chips was very different than the usual blended tomatoes-chilli-onion-cilantro. First, it was very dark in color, very mysterious. Next it was quite spicy. Visitors from back east beware. I think it had some tomatillo in it but  I didn't ask what all was in it so as not to spoil the magic. Next, it was taco Tuesday, so I ordered four shredded beef tacos. They were great. In addition to the usual lettuce-tomato-cheese topping, some cubes of cucumber were included. The lettuce was green leaf or romaine too, not the usual iceberg. These were fancier tacos than I've had in more expensive places. Lastly my wife ordered a chicken enchilada in green sauce and a cheese enchilada in red. The green sauce was extremely good and very mild. The red sauce was more mundane, but it's at least as good as the other sit downs in the east valley and better than some. We came in late on a Tuesday and the place had emptied out by then, but our server Karina was still bright and cheerful even at the end of what must have been a long day. If you visit, look forward to the salsa, tacos and green sauce. Definite cut above."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa, food was really good. The fish tacos exceptional,  we tried them fried and grilled.  Wish they served a Non alcoholic beer.   Fried ice cream was fine.. Prices are beyond reasonable.   We will be back"}
{"text":"Edible, but definitely not a place I will come back to.  The food really doesn't have much flavor.  Our party shared a cheese crisp. I had the chile relleno burrito with rice and beans. Nothing was great. The tortillas tasted like store bought. The burrito was simply strips of pablano chile and some melted cheese rolled into a tortilla. On a positive note, our server was friendly and made no mistakes with our order."}
{"text":"The first time we had dinner here my husband and I were impressed with the atmosphere, especially the live singer/guitarist who gave a great performance. The wait staff seated us promptly with our choice of a booth or table. Our waitress was very nice and personable and somewhat attentive to our food order. She was very attentive to the table that was ordering a lot of mixed drinks, but i digress...... The food was good and made to order from our special dietary needs. We left thinking we would give this place another try if we find ourselves around here in the future. Which we actually did last night. Last night we were again seated promptly with our choice of a booth and our waitress came over pretty quickly and took our order, but the evening quickly fell apart from there. We ordered according to our needs which is tricky for me because I cannot eat corn. I ordered the same as I did the first time but this time I was told I couldnt have what I wanted because managemnet was being particular about eliminating the corn from my order.  Our poor waitress came back to our table several times and finally I asked to see the manager. He finally agreed to make my order according to my needs and once our food came out, my husband had to send his food back because his was not made to order. Once his food finally made it back to the table, it was still wrong. Needless to say, La Casa has lost us as customers because we ended up with a stressful night despite the nuce atmosphere. The only saving grace of the evening was the guitarist, he plays very well and he could sing the menu if he wanted and it would be very enjoyable. La Casa, you get one star for having a great live singer."}
{"text":"Food is fairly good, but service is an unqualified \"F\". We've stood at the empty hostess stand for 5 minutes on several occasions with no one offering us one of the plenty of empty tables."}
{"text":"We only got take out, but the order was correct, even with our special requests  (wife wanted fried tacos, which they could do with flour shells). Everything tasted fresh and hot. We'd go back."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the new location at Southern and Dobson in Mesa a few times. The service has been consistently great, even when I was there with a large group. The salsa is excellent, not too hot or too gringo,  has a little kick and good flavor. I've been happy with everything I've ordered. I stick with a combo plate and mix it differently every time."}
{"text":"They're delivery service is perfect. I love being able to have Mexican food delivered to my door. They have great food. They make a good quality salsa and stew up a mean red enchilada sauce. In all honesty the rice sucks though you guys should work on that. Besides that la casa de juanos is the place to eat!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were coming from California to Tempe for the weekend and for a few days before we headed over to Tempe I was looking for a great place to eat for our Saturday night dinner.   I came upon La Casa De Juana and has some questions regarding their menu. The website was very well put together and had all the information would could need. I just wanted to call and make sure no reservation was needed. The woman who answered the phone was just a joy! I got off the phone knowing that is where I wanted to treat my boyfriend for dinner.  Fast forward to Saturday night, we were seated within 2 minutes. Our first table was rather small and upon letting the waitress know that we'd prefer a bigger table she(without a single hassle) helped move us over to a bigger table. We ordered till our hearts content. The good was great, our waitress was amazing. We were even asked by another waitress if everything was good. Customer service was top notch. We were recommended the Flan for dessert and it did not disappoint!!  The atmosphere!!! I fell in love! Papel Picado on the ceiling, mariachi playing, the art on the walls..... Beautiful  Over all great experience! We just had to get a picture with our waitresses!:)"}
{"text":"The food is great but lately it seems like they don't have enough help.  A few weeks ago we finally left because they didn't seat us even though there were empty tables and they were waiting for tables to be cleared.  10 minutes was way too long to wait.  Tonight I tried to phone in an order for takeout and got left on hold while I could hear them helping other customers.  Finally gave up and called back twice and recording said they weren't taking calls.  I guess they don't want our business.  A disappointment."}
{"text":"Great place!  We tried the tacos, enchiladas, and tamales and all were excellent.  One warning, some may find the chunky guacamole too sweet because of the peaches on top."}
{"text":"Excellent cuisine just down from the Pollack cinemas. Fun, colorful atmosphere, great happy hour beer specials and good food."}
{"text":"Margaritas were average, menudo was a bowl but had a small serving of a bowl. Large pieces of meat and little homini."}
{"text":"The food was so bad that they should've paid me to eat it. I made a huge order for my brothers and I and it was just horrible. The chicken was undercooked, cold and dry. The chicken quesadilla was extremely juicy with oil and undercooked as well. Terrible terrible food!"}
{"text":"Great food, but every time we've been here the service is extremely slow. The servers are hustling, working their asses off but there is only or two working at time. Tonight, we waited 35 minutes for our food and had to wave to get someone's attention for refills on drinks and salsa. And we never got the refills.   If you're coming for dinner, plan to be here awhile."}
{"text":"You're greeted with bright colors, wooden tables and cloth napkins. Not your usual boring d√©cor. While the chips are good, the little 3oz bowl of salsa doesn't last long. The salt shakers were plugged because the salt inside was moist, clumped. The replacement wasn't any better. In my opinion, nothing should come out of the kitchen that isn't delicious as is. Sometimes the burros are very dry and NEED a topping after the fact. The corn tamales are too sweet for my taste. They could be a dessert. The house margaritas are on the weak side. They need a wait staff that speaks fluent English in this location. Communication can be difficult and orders are frequently wrong. They're not very attentive. Refills, additions, and the check are slow to come. The food is good and prices are below average. Perhaps a little too low. It might be to their advantage to raise prices to improve the condiments. Overall, I would recommend Casa de Juana's; but they do have some small problems that need to be addressed to become a first class Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Delicious food!  Delivery option is always quick and ahead of the estimate!  Lots of vegetarian options!  I'd definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a great place that is hidden in Mesa. It's newer and everyone should try it. Very beautiful interior and our waitress was amazing! The salsa was delicious! The only thing I didn't like was all of the radish in my taco salad. I'll order something different next time. My man loved his chimichanga! I hope they get busier so they can extend their hours."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken chimichanga, enchilada style with both the red and green sauce, and it was delicious. The beans were incredible as well. Good customer service and a cute interior helped make it an even better experience. I'll definitely be back to try more off of their menu!"}
{"text":"We live across the valley and decided to take a chance on Juana's. It was a good choice. The service was good, the food was tasty and the environment was bright and colorful.   We had the combo to try our favorites. The enchiladas, tacos and flautas all passed muster. The chili relleno was good but it was just a poblano and cheese. Not as tasty as some we have had.   The salsa and chips were nice and tasty. The salsa was pleasantly warm with spice. They have a second salsa-if you ask-that has a strong smokey flavor. They said it was very spicy, but we thought the table salsa was hotter.   The margarita wasn't special. We wouldn't get it again unless it was happy hour."}
{"text":"Where to start! Service was terrible, 3 tables with 2 servers and no smiles. Food is blah, asked for a \"hot salsa\" - don't have it. Asked for a side of jalape√±os - they charged me for it! Margarita was sugar water with no tequila and salt on the rim. Uninspiring, won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch for the first time and will say everything was excellent. Service was friendly, fast and attentive. Food was wonderful. Had mini chimis to start, very tasty, came with guacamole which my wife said was very fresh and good. For main course we had combo plate with taco and tostada and shrimp Diablo, both of which were top notch. Would highly recommend, we will be going back soon."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I don't know how they got 4 fucking stars. They should be embarrassed to call this real Mexican food. Salsa tastes like water no type a spice in their food. Save your money go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant.  It has WONDERFUL decorations inside, full of life and color; truly delightful decor. You can see that put real love into creating the place.  The service is always excellent and friendly.  The food is really good, and the price is unbelievablely inexpensive, even for dinner.  I would pay more money for the same food.  This is a great new restaurant and it is now my de facto Mexican meal out."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and the best margarita I've ever had. Loved it! So good. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Just ordered the three item Mexican fiesta platter which we chose a Chicken Tamale, Taco, and a Cheese Chili Relleno. With a side of Guacamole. We had it delivered and it was hot and really good. My Wife and I each ordered one of these and would definitely order again. The delivery time was about 40 minutes which is exactly in the 40 to 50 minute delivery time. Now we have a go to Mexican food delivery place."}
{"text":"My wife had a craving for Fajitas. This place was rated #1 on yelp for fajitas in the area.  Wow. Great service.  Strong $5 margaritas and authentic, scratch Mexican cuisine.  We will be back to sample the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"We originally dined at the LCDJ Mesa location (Southern Avenue near Dobson), and thought the food was just OK\" .  Then a couple of months ago when we could not get a table at Vincitorio's (next to the Pollack Tempe Cinema - SEC of McClintock & Elliot), we decided to try the LCDJ in the same shopping center.  It is smaller than the Mesa restaurant and there wasn't any live music, but we found the food and the service to be better.  We went back again a couple of weeks ago and again had a very nice meal, PLUS 2 free Margarita's - a special they had for anyone who purchased an entree, and they were really delicious too!"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT RESTAURANT! They have a lot of food s for both vegetarians and meat lovers! A lot of unique platters to choose from. I had the shrimp Mexican pizza with a mango pineapple margaritas mixed with tequila it was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"If you're on McClintock and Elliot and want Mexican food, I could suggest about 8 places better than this one.  Went in after a movie, while wasting time getting my truck worked on across the street.  If you get your car worked on at that place (across the street) on a regular basis, you know, you have lots of time to kill.  I, like most, saw the add at the movie theater for $2 off and got the same bait and switch feeling once we got there.  Who's going to order an entr√©e right after leaving a movie theater full of popcorn.  I'm sure it's all in the fine print on the screen, but who's reading fine print on a movie screen.  Whatever, it's $2.  The place smelled funny when walking in initially.  Kind of like a bathroom that's been cleansed.  The food is just OK.  The restaurant was empty except us, the waitress was very nice.  The menu said rib eye is an extra $2, but was informed it's actually $4.  My GF loved it, but I don't think she really knows authentic Mexican food.  She ordered the beef tamales lunch special.  I thought the maza was mushy.  Nothing amazing.  I grew up eating tamales from New Mexico, so maybe I'm used to it a certain way.  I ordered the Mexican pizza which was HUGE, especially for the price, even after adding rib eye, so I appreciated that.  It's literally the size of a large pizza, so be prepared for leftovers!  I shared it with my 10 year old, and we were full after a little over half.  I can only really compare the flavor to being very similar to the taco bell Mexican pizza, only with slightly elevated ingredients in black beans rather than refried.  I ate the leftovers for dinner that evening.  Woke up about 4am with a terrible stomach ache, and my GF was already up in the guest bathroom.  She called in sick the next day.  Not going to blame the food, because I'm not like that.  Just telling my experience.  Not bad if you're stuck waiting to get your car fixed, but can't suggest coming here if you have means of transportation.  I hate giving bad reviews."}
{"text":"The tacos are pretty good. Ask for the hot salsa for the tacos, the stuff they bring to the table is pretty mild."}
{"text":"Such great authentic good! The service was quick and we were happy they served chips and salsa to hold us over until our delicious food came."}
{"text":"We ordered take out last night from here, having had dine-in previously.  I placed a wrong order, and I called back to correct it and they had no problems with it.  I went to pick up the order and the place was packed and appeared to be short-staffed. It took a few minutes for someone to come to the hostess stand and my order was retrieved. Super friendly server. I asked to use a coupon from my phone and they accepted it.  The food was pretty good, could have used some more seasoning, a little on the bland side. I am a fan of the rice they have with the cilantro, and the pinto beans with cheese were delicious. The portions are plentiful and the prices are very reasonable.  I would gladly return to eat here."}
{"text":"I love how this Mexican restraunt has vegetarian refried beans and a large vegetarian menu selection and the michiladas are delicious"}
{"text":"Casual, authentic Mexican, great for a weeknight dinner.  I'm a huge fan of the grilled jalapeno appetizer.  They have great happy hour specials also!  Service can be a bit slow at times, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Not exactly sure why this place is rated 4 stars. The portions were small. They don't offer ground beef and they charge 2.45 for soda. The amount of meat I did get on my taco and chimicanga was minimal. To be fair, the inside decorations were gorgeous and the servers were friendly. I personally don't think I'll go back. The prices were fair for the amount I received, but it was just okay Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food was very,  very good. I had the tequila lime chicken, which was amazing. And, the quesadilla was also very delicious at the beginning. I am looking forward to going back for breakfast sometime!"}
{"text":"When I have to apologize to my wife because this was my choice of where to go for Margaritas and a bite to eat. Yelp gave four stars and I thought it must be a decent place......wrong!  First we had to seat ourselves because the one person that was working the front was to busy waiting on the two occupied tables. After waiting we seated ourselves adjacent to the Bar. It took about 10 or 15 min. Before the one guy was able to ask what we needed. We ordered the Jauna combination Hors d oeuvres and the happy hour blended margaritas no salt. Again we sat and sat until I watched the one guy making margaritas on the rocks...alas they were for another customer. We waited and waited and then finally the one guy was behind the bar making blended margaritas with salt but this time he barely put tequila at all into the blender about half of what he put into the margaritas on the rocks I'd watched him make earlier. Needless to say the margaritas were weak and the hors d oeuvres were meager.....will not be returning!!! Sometimes Yelp is spot on and apparently sometimes it is not."}
{"text":"Bright and fun decor. The wait staff is friendly with expansive menu. $5.00 house margaritas."}
{"text":"this is hands down he worst mexican food i have ever had. mushy tamales, small enchiladas and the nastiest tasting green sauce i have ever eaten. on top of that the service was horrible when ever we asked a question or said anything this server would kinda stand back with her hand out like ***** and talk to us like we were dumb. told her about the the tamales her respond uuuuuuu all our tamales are like that you didn't know then just stands there stares at us. i will never go there again even if i was dying and i have told everyone do not go here."}
{"text":"Great service!!! Love the atmosphere!!! Great food!!! Great first experience definitely going to make it back soon. The strawberry Margarita's where refreshing had fresh strawberry chunks. 5 star in my book!"}
{"text":"On a trip to Phoenix, we found this place on YELP and we're so glad we decided to try it out.   The salsa was okay,  not the most memorable, but the guacamole was DELISH and much recommended. It's chunky, perfectly oniony & garlicky, but also a little sweet from the mango. A really great marriage of flavors!!   There were quite a few vegetarian options and the beans are lard free. My friend had the shrimp tacos and I had the calabacitas.   We would definitely go to this place again."}
{"text":"Seriously, the best fish tacos I have ever had and the Juana margarita was excellent! Highly recommend and will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great decor and very personable service. Had the fajita special, perfect for two people and very deicious!"}
{"text":"The food was so good! I ordered the Mexican pizza and the veggies were nice and crispy as was the crust. My daughter really enjoyed her chicken flautas and my husband said their breakfast burrito was good. We did not have to wait for a table and the food came quick-important when you have little ones! There was also a singer/guitarist who sang beautifully. My eldest really loved watching him play. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I got it delivered and it's amazing. I had the chicken nachos and the fish tacos. I didn't realize they were going to put red cabbage on the tacos so if you don't like red cabbage here's your warning so you can request it to not be added. The portions were huge! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The food is great...I highly recommend the hard tacos combo, the rice and beans taste fresh and not canned/pre-processed...also the cilantro margarita is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Great salsa. Super slow service. Not crowded at all but it took 15 minutes to get iced tea and water. Still no food in sight.  Food finally came after 40 minutes and was very tasty. Not sure why it took so long. Now that we're done eating the wait for the check begins."}
{"text":"Cilantro cream chicken won rave reviews from my dinner companion, and my vegetable tacos were very tasty."}
{"text":"The food was terrible and one of my family members got food Poisoning , possibly from the La Casa De Juana in Tempe..I contacted Manager and Owner and they fo not seem too concerned..did not even offer my money back for the dinner!  And now..the manager sent me something saying we spoke many.times..NOT true. Do not eat here..you will not get your money back."}
{"text":"It's OK but far from authentic mexican.. nothing to brag about to be honest, salsa has no heat, food has no heat and they lack correct rice, they serve a cilantro rice that I don't care for.. They promote authentic mexican but fail to deliver, just another plain Jane mex resturant. There margarita is weak as hell, all mix.. I won't come back, jmho.."}
{"text":"This is wonderful food. They have great specials. My favorite is the enchiladas. You have the option of adding avocado & crema for a $1 or having  mole sauce added for $1. I highly recommend spending the $2 and doing both. The mole sauce is divine when combined with the avocado and crema it is nirvana.  The Jamaica (hibiscus drink) is refreshing. The molletes is one of our favorite appetizers.  All in all the mesa location gets top marks for food and atmosphere. The servers are friendly and keep your drinks filled. Even when they are busy they make time for each table."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant. I have lost a lot of weight and I love the authenticity of this place.   I can get pescado Veracruz  tacos, enchiladas, and vegetarian fare.  These come with beans without lard and rice or I substitute  calabacitas This place is the REAL DEAL... literally!  Service is WONDERFUL."}
{"text":"Used to be great . The waitress was nasty. The food has deteriorated. Prices have gone up. I have come here every week for a year, and I will never return."}
{"text":"Not the Top Shelf of Yesteryear  The decor is phenomenal. Service was great! Then, I had the bacon wrapped shrimp - cannot remember the menu name, Chef/cook needs to cook one the way it was served and taste it. Bacon was OK, shrimp was almost jerky, WAY overcooked. I have this elswhere and it was great. Wife had the Carne Asada salad, It was a good portion, a lot of which ended up on the side plate as unedible. The beer and wine were good. This was 4:30- 5:00 PM midweek and at first we were the only folks there. By the time we left there were at least 2-3m more couples. Sorry to say, we will never be back. The decor was really nice though."}
{"text":"First off we orded gucamole and they told me that they only had a little avocado and it comes with every order so they cant get me guacamole.  Then the margaritas were just so terrible.   We had a hair and platic in our food.  I will say they were fast since we were the only people in the restaurant.    I was very disappointed because the place is beautifully bright inside. Ill give it another try one day...maybe ill bring my own avocados though."}
{"text":"Was craving mexican food and we really dont have many options close by, until now.  This is a fairly new place about 10 months old located in a strip mall and it is nicely decorated.  Waited a few minutes to be seated and table needed wiping down. The place wasnt busy but by the time we left it was and there was only one server and the manager helping.  I had the Sopes with Carnitas and although it was a big plate and was tasty, it had too much lettuce and was a bit too greasy.  The enchiladas were good."}
{"text":"Mariachis, fun atmosphere, and good food! Would have been 5 stars but as a new restaurant they are still having some growing pains. The place was packed and they ran out of glasses, had to be served in styrofoam cups initially. The server upgraded us to beautiful Mexican handblown glasses about 10 minutes later and apologized profusely. The staff was great, everyone was attentive and nice, just busy!  The chips and salsa were very good. The corn tortillas were delicious. The flour tortillas were ok. Beans and rice were very authentic and tasted great! We split the fajita duo. Again, tasted very authentic and was delicious.   Definitely going back, can't wait to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"Food portions were on the smaller side.  Fajitas were good but could have used more meat. Salsa was good flavor but could have used more heat.  Enchilada sauce was on the Smokey side and did not care for flavor.  Enchilada was really small.  Rice was lacking in flavor. Would go back but not too soon."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here. My favorite mexican restaurant in Arizona. The food is delicious and authentic. I have only tried the veggie chimichanga so far, it's really good! They put the right veggies in it. I asked for no cucumbers or mushrooms. The pico on the side had cucumbers in it but it was fine since it was just tiny pieces of it, I just can't stand regular size pieces of cucumbers. I was told the pico came with the cucumbers ahead of time too so it was all good. Our waitress the 2nd time around was really knowledgeable. I asked for a side of rice but decided not to get it after she informed me they made it with chicken broth, I really appreciated that since I am a true vegetarian. They made good size dishes and my girl tells me the house magaritas here are amazing."}
{"text":"Brought my husband here for the first time after eating lunch here with a friend. Was pleasantly surprised to find that it was packed, but we were seated quickly on a Saturday night. The wait staff was extremely efficient and attentive. Much to our surprise, two musicians started playing and serenading us. It was lovely. They had rich voices and played guitar, harmonica, and maracas. Our food was piping hot and delicious. By the time we finished, there was a wait. The server constantly filled our water. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were curious when we saw the signs go up... a few weeks later we had a menu on our door and low and behold a Mexican restaurant that delivered to us?!?!?!  We finally ordered tonight after a long work week and a crazy 2 year old that we didn't want to take out to dinner.  I called for delivery and was told there was no driver this evening.  I asked if this was the norm and the gentleman who answered the phone asked if we lived far and the size of the order.  He took our number and asked if it was ok to see if anyone could deliver and he would call us back within five minutes.  He called back a minute later and took our order.  He was kind, concise and a pleasure to speak with.  Our order was delivered in 20-25 minutes.  Although the portions were smaller than anticipated I would rather take quality over quantity.  Having DELICIOUS Mexican food delivered is UNHEARD of!  I can't wait to come dine in the restaurant for the full experience.  S. Tempe is lacking in decent Mexican food and I sincerely welcome their presence (especially after a sickeningly awful experience at a local chain located on Rural and Guadalupe where we were stereotyped for having a child.) Much appreciated service!!!"}
{"text":"One day I was craving Tamales, so I checked Yelp and found this place to be a good spot to try out.  The Tamales were pretty good.  I usually buy them plain, but these come with either a red/green sauce over it.  I found out that on Thursday's they have a $2.00 tamale deal, so I may go back to pick up a dozen.  They have a good looking menu that makes me want to try some other things out.  They haven't disappointed yet and I hope they never do.  I'm always down to eat me some good authentic Mexican food.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Update:  We ended up continuing to dine here on a regular basis as we enjoy the service and food.  We never saw that strange fellow outside again.  The whole shopping area on this corner seems to be on the up-and-up and when not in the mood for Mexican, we're looking forward to try out the new restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"We had lunch for the 1st time at the Elliott location.  Although not a vegetarian, I had the 3 vegetarian tostadas which are served with beans and lots of fresh greens.  Our 20% off coupon was readily accepted.  For me, the salsa was better than our regular places and they serve coke products.  Lunch was busy at noon (Thurs), so I'd suggest arriving a little earlier.  This may become our go-to Mexican place."}
{"text":"Love Taco Tuesdays. $2 tacos. Best carnitas tacos around.  Chicken and beef are also very good."}
{"text":"First time here and did not disappoint. The interior is bright, festive and I just loved it. I ordered a 3 enchilada plate with rice and beans for $8.95(?) and my plate was huge, came out quick and was delicious. My friend ordered the fiesta plate with 3 items, rice and beans and for $9-10 and her dish was big too! The amount  you get for what you pay is ridiculously large! Our food was very fast, our server was attentive and efficient, atmosphere was festive and budget was right on point. I'd recommend and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Everything about this place screams Mexico. I mean the napkins alone were made of cloth with mexican design and of course all the Mexican decor on the walls added to the ambience as well as the Spanish music they were playing. They must have hired an interior designer for this awesome restaurant. The food was el supremo for sure. I got the taco salad and the chicken was so soft and tender. When it comes to dining out here I say muy bien..Mucho gracias... I'll be back the next time I go see a movie down the street at pollack theatre."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Wow!!!! Great service great people! Manager came to my table and personal thanked my for me coming in! Food was a ten out of ten!!! My first time there but I will be back!"}
{"text":"Have been here many, many times over the last few years.  Always receive a warm welcome and friendly, attentive service.  The food is authentic, traditional Mexican as you would expect from a family run place.  Salsa is excellent, gotta avoid going big on the chips before dinner!!  And my goodness does it come out fast. and hot!  Can't remember waiting more that 10-15 minutes from the waitress taking our order."}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was a let down. I ordered chicken tacos and they came with rice and beans but not the normal Spanish rice but a green concoction that did not taste good at all. The tacos were quite small. Won't be coming back but it was worth the one time visit."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out for a while because I have have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant ever since I moved from New Mexico. To this day I still have not found a place that I can give 5 stars to yet.   I will say the food here was good. The refined beans were tasty, the Mexican rice had a great taste, and the hard shell taco plate with carnitas was alright. Couldn't really taste any seasoning on the carnitas but the shells were amazing and crunchy. If you enjoy cilantro you will love this place. Salsa is very very mild roasted green chili with cilantro that I would say gives the salsa its flavor. The green sauce at the two Mexican fast food joints near here are hotter.   Overall service was great, love the decorations inside, and the authentic spanish music that is played! Gives you a great vibe while eating and a feeling of being in Mexico!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying La Casa de Juana.  We will definitely be back. The food is authentic and delicious. This is about a 25 minute drive from our home, but it will be a regular hang out for us. If you're looking for true Mexican food with a lot of variety on the menu , this is your go to place."}
{"text":"Great lunch and now we ate here for breakfast!  Yummy!  Kind of hard to see from the street but worth the search!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place so we tried it. Service was VERY SLOW, not that it was the fault of the 2 servers but looked like they could've use 2 more servers at peak dinner time. I got the taco combo plate, tacos were very small & meat was sparse, rice was a green concoction & flavorless, beans were very runny. Cheese wasn't even melted in or on top of my Daughters cheese enchiladas!?!  The only reason I gave 2 stars because my beers were ice cold & servers tried their best! We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Omg you love it if you're vegan and/or vegetarian. They have many options, flavors, i mean, I eat meat but not often and prefer plant based! This is great news people!!Come in, check it out!"}
{"text":"We found the food to be adequate but not exciting. I did like that the chile Relleno had no breading. It was light and yummy. But there are a few kinks to work out. The server seemed afraid of us and that was tiring. We could hear the chef calling orders in the back and there was no need to be that loud. We heard chef and server have an argument over what we ordered."}
{"text":"This is our go to for affordable home style Mexican in the neighborhood. The food is solid but not great. On the upside, there's a large vegetarian menu and the make your own combo options offer a good deal of flexibility. The salsa is my absolute favorite. Okay, I really only come here for the salsa. The service is always friendly and fast and the restaurant is very kid friendly. There are also good daily food/drink specials. On the downside, the chili relleno is kind of hit or miss--they're often not seeded well enough. The other thing that's completely hit or miss is the accuracy of take out orders. It's more like a total miss. Our family jokes about whose order will be screwed up. Last time it was everyone's--and no tortilla or salsa in the order. Did I mention I only eat here for the salsa:("}
{"text":"The food and service her are reliably good. We often go here for lunch and drinks are kept full and food arrives quickly The one critique I have is that they seem dumb founded every time we ask for hot sauces. Normally I would expect at least one from a selection of hot sauces like Tapatio, Cholula. etc.  In some cases they do have a habanero salsa or tabasco but only seemed to have one bottle so we had to wait which seems odd.   Would be 4.5 stars if they address the salsa issue I have."}
{"text":"Fun decor good chips and Salsa but slow slow service our waitress came by half a dozen times to apologize. Said was because of one big table maybe 6 people on a half empty restaurant. Then my Chilli Rellano with cold. My wife's salad was good but not a good first experience in a town with way to many Mexican Restaurants."}
{"text":"Our first time in.. Loved it!!! Everything from the chips and salsa, to the appetizers to our main course was delicious!! Restaurant was very clean and beautifully decorated! \"Hyatt\" (I hope I spelled that right) was our server.. She was amazing!!! Ask for her!!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place?! Why did they rid of a good server/hostess and Food? They changed the menus too. This place is a bummer now. Poor slow service too."}
{"text":"Great Food, Service, and a very reasonable price, from Dallas Texas.  Go Texas Rangers!"}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars and the ONLY reason I am giving them 4 stars is because the last two times I've been here (out of more than a dozen) management has one server on the floor. Granted one of the two times was an odd time. But the servers get swamped and they're \"in the weeds\". Lucky for them, I was a long time server in my youth and am well aware none of the scheduling has anything to do with them. I also know they were doing their absolute best with the situation they'd been given. My fear is, some customers will not give nearly as much grace as a vet, like myself. People who haven't been in the food industry don't have the same outlook as those of us who were.   As far as service, outside of those two times, it's always fantastic. The food is good and the salsa is SO good, I could drink it! Most of the time I'm happy to pay the $6.99 for a pint of salsa to take home. If you haven't tried this place, keep an eye out for their coupon in your junk mail. If you trust me, just go!"}
{"text":"Really good food.Great salsa. Great service. Good prices. Nicely decorated. Probably will become my new Mexican neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Our waitress was awesome and out food was delicious!! Great prices, service and food! Not to mention great Sunday beer and margarita specials!! This is our new mexican food spot!! So glad to have found it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the very first and I fell in love with the nopales super delicious and my hubby has the fish tacos totally loved them we for sure will be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and good Mexican food I must say. Chimi Changa poem was delicious and even the veggie enchilada was good too"}
{"text":"Checked out this place for the first time today and I have to say I was very impressed! After a long day moving into a new place, and all we wanted was a cold beer and some good food. We definitely killed two birds with one stone by stopping by this place. We were pleasantly surprised that we had the place to ourselves, which I have to add, is a beautifully decorated and furnished restaurant. The service was good as we were helped by a very cute and attentive waitress, forget her name but she definitely earned her tip while we were there. Now to the most important part, the food. Authentically delicious is how I'd sum up my meal, ordered the green corn tamales. Their menu is full of vegetarian options, a full page on their lunch menu if you have a vegetarian or vegan(with slight modification) in the family!"}
{"text":"The margaritas looked good, but that is where the experience stopped.  Chips were ok and salsa did not stand out either.  We were a party of 5 but 3 kids.  They seemed to have only one table for parties over 4.  Entrees were not terrible, just small portions.  It was uninspired mexican cuisine, that did not stand up to the tasty descriptions on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful addition to a location that already has some great options. If there's one word I'd use to describe Juana's it would be fresh.  Their ingredients are all incredibly fresh and flavorful, especially the salsas and guacamole.  This is not your gloppy, chain Mexican food--Juana's has more authentic Mexican food that is packed with flavor.  Their margaritas, especially with the happy hour price, are exceptional, the best around.  Service is incredibly friendly, but they're still working out some of the kinks so be patient.  But it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Only one server for lunch and they were pretty busy so service was slow with few drink or salsa refills.  Chips and salsa are DELICIOUS.  Lunch specials are a good deal.  Veggie enchiladas were just okay.  Beans are just okay.  Fried ice cream was good."}
{"text":"Awesome a must eat at resturant The food and service was wonderful. Clean and cheerful in here as well Went back again today and the waiter aj is a riot.  Great food and service again"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! Delicious margaritas, guacamole. Very fresh! I had the chicken enchiladas, they were wonderful. Service was great! We were here on vacation, but if we lived here we would be regulars!"}
{"text":"Can you say Yummy?! I have been here twice now and love the food and the service.  Very festive and sometimes they offer weekday specials! I am a Mexican food connoisseur and everything about this place is satisfying from the food to the creative decor. I will certainly be a regular here."}
{"text":"Service was so incredibly slow but the chips and salsa were good and the portion sizes generous.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes to bring us water. We've been waiting another 15 min and our appetizer isn't out yet. We asked for salt and was told she can't find any salt in the restaurant. So... you guys do with this information as you please."}
{"text":"Very good combinations at lunch. A lot of food for the price. Taste was spot on for my 3 combo plate."}
{"text":"Terrible margaritas! Don't bother even if it's happy hour. The burrito was ok, nothing special with no wow factor. The Mexican pizza was the star at our table. It was delicious and loaded and the 'crust' was perfection. Would go back just for the mexican pizza and skip the rest. Also, service was good! Absolutely no complaints in that area. Loved the colorful decor. It's very festive."}
{"text":"This was the first Mexican restaurant we tried since moving to Arizona. Very colorful, cozy spot. The service is very quick and friendly! I was really impressed with how many unique vegetarian options they had! I ordered the nopalitos rancheros and a chile relleno, one of the best I've ever had! The sope my husband ordered was also very good, and  the chips and salsa were very fresh, and tasty. We left stuffed to say the least.. Great  prices too."}
{"text":"Very cute,  brightly colored,  small establishment in Tempe. The service was friendly,  prices reasonable,  although we really felt the food was so so. Tamales were mostly masa, red sauce bland. This doesn't mean other items could be more exciting than our experience.  I think it's worth trying out.  Although,  I will look elsewhere in the future!"}
{"text":"LA Casa De Juana is fantastic! Finally a place close by that actually serves authentic and fresh Mexican dishes in a fun environment.  This is our new go-to mexican in Tempe!! And now that I know they deliver on the weekends, they will get even more business. :)"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!! The food is absolutely delicious and the service is great!! I am 100% Mexican and this is truly authentic Mexican food, it reminds me of my mothers food and that's hard for me to find! They also have a full bar!! We will be coming back real soon that's for sure!!! Arriba!! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, kid/family friendly. Went there Friday 5/26 with in-laws, two kids, two adults. First time. Very impressed by a large menu with kid menu including quesadilla and rice. Waitress was awesome, attentive, filled chips & salsa twice. Everything we ordered was fresh & tasty including ceviche. Excellent value (we've spent more on lunch in Phoenix), and that included a happy hour beer for me and father-in-law. The fellow playing the guitar was warm and blessed with a soothing singing voice. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time last night because I had seen it on Facebook and thought I would give it a try. First impression upon walking inside:  Lighting is way too bright and takes away from a comfortable, cozy, relaxing atmosphere. Walls are painted extremely bright yellow, and that mixed with the bright lights does not set the tone for a relaxing dinner.  Hostess greeted us right away, then she ended up being server as well.  After we were seated our server took our drink order right away. I ordered a strawberry margarita but was informed they were out of strawberries (on a Wednesday night at 7 pm) so I ordered a regular marg. The person I was with ordered a pineapple margarita but it had no pineapple flavor at all and was blended way too long and turned into a frothy concoction of I don't know what. So I'm thinking fail on the frozen marg, the one on the rocks was ok.   It took forever for our server to bring the chips and salsa. I think she decided to be the bartender as well...she should've brought the chips before making the drinks. After she brought the drinks (20 min later) and chips, she walked away and said I'll be back for your order and came back 10 min later.   The food:  The food wasn't bad. I admit I did clear my plate. But there was something missing that I can't quite figure out. I'm thinking lack of spices.. It was kind of bland and dry. Definitely needs more sauce when ordering enchilada style. The rice was green (not an appealing look, red is better).. I want so bad to like this place. I MIGHT give it another try and order something different and maybe make some gentle suggestions. Stay tuned for a possible updated review. For now it stays at 3 stars. 2 stars for service (unoblivious server ended up cleaning tables and we had to hunt her down for our check) but the food gets 3 stars and maybe 4 with a little help down the road."}
{"text":"La Casa de Juana is very vegetarian friendly and the food is delicious. I liked the potato tacos; they're not bursting with flavor on their own but the base flavor is good and they can be spiced up with salsa. The chips and salsa tasted fresh. Mild, but you may be able to ask for spicier. The staff was also very friendly, and the decor is adorable. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been in here. I go to school right across the street, and when I get out at 7pm, I'm hungry! The first time was decent enough, very inexpensive but nothing to hurry back for. My server was on the other side of the partition talking on an obviously personal phone call most of the time, but was OK. This time, I was seated by what could only be a manager across from a couple who still had menus. 5 minutes went by and still no one has approached the table. The couple's order is taken. There I sit. Ten minutes... still nothing. I get up to see where they all are and there are two servers at the POS, my guess closing out their checks from a large party that had just left.  Note to servers: Priorities and sense of urgency are a major factor of waiting tables. You serve customers before you count your money / close out your tickets. Management: You should be walking around making sure things are going well.  It's not like it was near closing time, it was 7:10 when I arrived.  Guess I'll make the extra drive to Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"I haven't expected experienced a sit down meal here but have had take out several times and everything I have ordered has been super yummy! My order is fulfilled quickly and the staff is always very nice.   The salsa is very flavorful and their burritos enchilada style are also very good! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"love it. it's great. rice and beans are gluten free & vegan. love it. will come back forever. having all my birthday's here, my wedding, my children will be born here, my funeral will be here.  10/10. top notch."}
{"text":"My familia and I love this place! We have eaten lunches, dinners and celebrated 4-5 different birthdays, including my own, at this wonderful restaurant! The staff has always been considerate and attentive, even when the place was full and very busy.  This is one place you don't want to miss. In our collective opinions, it's the best Mexican restaurant in town! Viva Juana!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after seeing it advertised at the movie theater.  We were seated and our waitress was right there with warm chips and salsa. I ordered the Sopes which were very good. This is the first Mexican restaurant that I've been in that had Sopes. My friend had the make your own platter. She had enchiladas and a tostada which she said was really good.  The service  and the food was very good. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat! When we first walked in the fact that there were beautiful cloth napkins says that they are environmentally responsible. Also the napkins adds to the Orr. The food was great and the service was fantastic! Also the prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is very very authentic. Try it...I think you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Friendly efficient staff. Vegetarian menu is on point! My husband loves the steak fajitas. Live music!"}
{"text":"Met a buddy for lunch at Las Casa De Juana today at his suggestion.  What a cute little spot.  The decor is what separates this place from the many locally owned Mexican restaurants in the Southeast Valley.  Really fantastic Mexican artwork on the chairs, tables, and decorating the walls.  Even some interesting statues.  Plus, the food was very good.  I'm not an expert but I thought the Carnitas Chimi was excellent.  You get complimentary chips and a combination green/red salsa that was very tasty.  The service was prompt and friendly.  I think this would be a great spot to share with out of town guests, which I will be doing in the near future."}
{"text":"I went there today for the first time and I loved it. Food was very good and the server was truly very nice. The prices are very decent as well.I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is beautifully decorated and very colorful. It's a fun and cheerful atmosphere. The food and drinks were delicious and very authentic. I had the 3 small lime ceviche tostadas and their regular margarita on the rocks w salt. I'm not a margarita person but this was really good! I highly recommend it! They give you complimentary chips and salsa and their salsa is mild but very flavorful.  I love their colorful plates, glasses and colorful cloth napkins!! Brought us back to our trip to central Mexico- LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! The service is great and the staff is super friendly and attentive! We'll be back w/ our friends and family!"}
{"text":"This is the most disgusting mexican restaurant I've ordered from and I have never said that before. The only decent things were the rice and beans, and even then, it wasn't that great. I ordered my food to go and got the queso fundido dip appetizer to put on top of my chicken Chimi. The chicken for one thing was bland and flavorless, even with sauce on it. But the queso dip...I have no idea what the hell they gave me. It certainly wasn't a dip. I literally had to cut it as it was just a SLICE OF CHEESE with some chorizo and jalepeno thrown on there. I love mexican food, so I figured it would try it all together. Wrong. All wrong. It was disgusting. I've had a better chimi from a gas station. I am so shocked at how this place has such a high rating. Go to Arribas or Valle Luna. Rositas is great, too. This was just plain garbage."}
{"text":"Eeeehhh.....the decor is bright and fun but its the opposite of service and food. I did however like the rice and the salsa was really good BUT I will say they serve you tiny tiny portions of it and it took quite some time to get refills of the good stuff. The salsa is free so maybe they try to delay and buy time in hopes your order would be up soon! In Arizona, Mexican food is in abundance and lies in the tastebuds of every person: )"}
{"text":"La Casa De Juana is now the answer for where to go when I want mexican food that isn't sold from a shack but isn't some big overhyped-expensive chain either. La Casa is the perfect spot for a sit down meal that starts with a delicious bowl of chips and salsa and if it's been a rough day (or just about any day) a solid house margarita that packs a punch, no weak stuff here.  Been here several times now after a friend had mentioned it a few times. The atmosphere is very much the mexican theme popular in some bigger restaurants but the size and wonderful service remind you it's a true local spot. The service here is always great with friendly employees who are quick to refill drinks and keep the chips and salsa coming (did I mention I like the chips and salsa?).  After coming here the first time and being very impressed with the fiesta combo with I think it was a taco, tamale and tostada I had the confidence to do what I don't do at most mexican places and try the fish tacos and shrimp ceviche both of were very tasty, I think the tacos were the better of the two however. All of the prices are extremely reasonable especially on the combos and taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Happy to update my review! We had an excellent meal including a chicken enchilada with green sauce, fish taco, shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada with red sauce. We didn't wait to be seated, we were waited on immediately,  and our food came quickly. This was a complete opposite experience from before. Food was never an issue, it is so flavorful and delicious, including the beans, rice, chips and salsa. Won't wait 6 months to visit again."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful place, I love all the staff that they genuinely care about your experience!!! Such yummy tamales!!! Thank you La Casa De Juana you're our new favorite Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"The food was delicious but I ordered a large horchata and it came in a small foam cup for almost 4dllrs! A small but other then that it was good."}
{"text":"We had a great time here. The employees know my parents as regular customers and even asked why they had been gone and if they had been sick. My shredded beef taco salad was really good and my son liked his bean burrito and cilantro rice. Very cozy and friendly."}
{"text":"The worse restaurant I have ever been too. Horrible food, worse customer service ever. Tony and the owner (tall guy with glasses) have no idea how to run a business. Ever heard of the customer is always right? So rude to their employees!!!! And to top is all off it has the worse \"bathroom\" smell!! I would never recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to La Casa De Juana and what a great option this is for our neighborhood eateries. A Mexican restaurant of this standard has been missing from the area and what a happy find.   We were greeted immediately on a Friday night at around 6 pm. The place was beginning to buzz around then. By 7 pm, it was full and busy. There were families, kids, tables full of co-workers, etc. get there early to beat the rush!   Our server was an upbeat happy person. I recognized her and it took me a while to remember where I'd met her before. It was from a dining establishment near where I work. Same happy person that served me efficiently and happily years ago. HIatt was quick with service, has a great sense of humor, and even remembered me from years ago. HIatt actually made our experience more enjoyable. She is awesome. Ask for a table in her area. She'll take good care of you.   On to the food...it was surprisingly authentic. The menu was  quite extensive and offers everything from fish tacos to chorizo and eggs (at any time) to burgers. I had the fish tacos that came with rice and beans. The rice was a color I had not seen on Mexican rice. It was almost a greenish color, and it was delicious!  It was perfectly cooked and had a bit of peas in it, which I happen to love. The fish tacos were small but that was ok because that is pretty typical. The sauce was a bit spicy, but again, I love that in a taco. Oh, and the chips were thin and great tasting; not too think or greasy. The salsa could have a bit more spicy for me.   Prices were good and the beer cold. Colorful interior with very friendly, accommodating staff. A great nigh over all. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fairly small restaurant that totally fit the bill when looking for Mexican food while on vacation in the Phoenix area. We showed up with a party of 5 and were seated immediately.  Our server did a great job and we definitely enjoyed our lunch. We had a variety of dishes from fajitas and chimichangas to burritos and enchiladas. Everything was served piping hot and just as we asked. The sopapillas were great although we'd have liked some honey on the table in addition to what was drizzled on the plates of sopapillas.  When we get back to this area we'll visit again. Thanks for the great lunch!"}
{"text":"this place was so cute! the service was amazing and two sweet little old men sang wonderfully. it was a pleasant surprise! i had the chicken fajitas (SO MUCH FOOD) and my boyfriend had the shrimp diablo. the chicken was perfect and juicy and his shrimp was super spicy lol but he was warned before he ordered it! our server was so sweet and very attentive. we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and helpful. It was colorful and we enjoyed the live music on Sunday night. However, of the 7 people dining with us, 6 have been violently ill with food poisoning since then.  The only person in our party that did not get sick was our picky son who opted for a hamburger instead. It is probably the last place I will want to see again in this lifetime."}
{"text":"The guacamole is amazing! The rest of the food was good too.. Rice is a little bland. They deliver in Tempe which is awesome when I'm lazy."}
{"text":"I was not a big fan of Mexican food until I ate at this restaurant for lunch today. The fish taco, tamale,  enchilada and cilantro rice with black beans was so flavorful. Our waitress Hyatt was friendly and efficient. This will be our new favorite Mexican restaurant,"}
{"text":"Love the food and the decoration!  I don't normally finish my meals, but I order the biggest plate and I did"}
{"text":"While having a lazy Sunday morning with my boyfriend we decided to order delivery. The food arrived quickly. I ordered the veggie enchiladas. There was a random piece of meat in mine. Not such a huge issue for me as I am not vegatarian but I imagine if I was that would be pretty upsetting. The flavor was good but the corn tortillas were soggy and almost fell apart in mushy pieces. The street tacos had nothing but flavorless meat. No pico even!  All in all the food was just ok."}
{"text":"Calabazitas - big delicious meal with salad and beans. Mexican zucchini mixed with vegetables, butter, mild salsa, Mexican cream and cheese, served with beans and salad. This was delicious and is a full meal.  Hayatt is a great waitress. She's thoughtful and considerate and very good at her job.  My drink never got low.  The salsa is delicious and a unique recipe.  The environment is very colourful and clean.  Tamales were on sale Thursday at lunch. Hooray."}
{"text":"Been here twice, Solid and delicious traditional menu.   Would have given 5 stars but the frozen ice cream was not good.  Should have a warm crispy crust with ice cream inside but it was just this hard frozen ball with patches of what seemed like cornflakes...also frozen...."}
{"text":"We have ate at many Mexican food joints for awhile and what I had was OK......went simply with a pork hard taco, was ok kinda small, green corn tamale that was very sweet."}
{"text":"Just your average Mexican restaurant... we went in on a Friday night and it wasn't very busy... chips and salsa were average at best... I ordered a fried chimichanga with spicy jalape√±o sauce. that too, was average at best along with the brand and rice.. my friends ordered the breakfast burrito and one for the enchiladas and they weren't up to par. Not impressed"}
{"text":"I almost feel bad.  I mean, I'm sure this place won't be around very long. Reminded me a frozen burrito. Overly dry and crunchy rice.  Sour mix margaritas.  Too bad. I wish it was good because we need something on this corner."}
{"text":"The bomb! $2.00 beers Happy Hours 7 days a week. Service was excellent. I got Cielo tierra y mar. Just like fajitas without the hot plate. Must try! Green rice, cooked with blended pablanos and cilantro. Never seen this before, sooooo good!"}
{"text":"ordered a burrito from here when i was visiting AZ for take out. was probably one of the best burritos i have had. granted i am from NY and have not had the best Mexican food in my life. but this place does it right no matter where you are from. layers on layers of flavor and the right amount of cheese to sauce ratio here. i love this place."}
{"text":"I'm was on vacation when I checked this place out and it was hands down the best meal I had. Come out to NYC Juana!"}
{"text":"It wasnt special. The margaritas were watery and the fajitas had to much oil or butter and was overcooked. Will not go back unfortunately"}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for new Mexican food places to try, so followed other Yelpers' advice and went to Las Casa de Juana.  As others have mentioned, the lighting is pretty bright in some areas of the restaurant. So bright, you could almost count the chips in the baskets on other tables. While the atmosphere isn't cozy, it is playful.  There's color everywhere from the picturesque painted chairs  and tables, wall and ceiling decorations, to the attractive bright plaid cloth napkins.   The menu is extensive with some unusual dishes.  Prices are reasonable.  I give the food mixed reviews: chicken tamale good, fish taco skimpy, rice excellent, beans bland.  Salsa was very good.  Overall, a nice place to get some Mexican comfort food.     At 6:00 p.m. on a Saturday night, there was live music. -- a nice, mellow guitarist/singer.  This restaurant could easily accommodate a large group."}
{"text":"I am not really sure what the hype is all about. The food is not bad it's average the place is nice and clean good customer service"}
{"text":"They were badly under staff for lunch hour. We waited by the front door for 20min.  And there was no greeting or acknowledgement that we been waiting for a while. They did have some empty tables but there was no sense of urgency in attending us. We ended up leaving!"}
{"text":"Beef chimichanga was great!! Didn't taste oily and the rice was awesome! Whole meal felt pretty healthy for being a fried dish. The service is a little more slow paced but that just added to the nice, laid-back vibe!"}
{"text":"Good place. I go there frequently. They aren't a 5 but they are a solid 4. Have some hard workers and good food. Wish they gave bean dip with the chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Overall food was really good here and full of flavor. I had the fajitas and fish tacos. Next time I will be back to try the veggies dishes. Oh and the margaritas are slightly on the bitter side and it contained one shot. They are freshly made and I was satisfied. The decor is really cool downstairs and they even have an upstairs deck to sit that had a cozy atmosphere. They have an outside patio but unfortunately with old, fuzzy televisions throughout."}
{"text":"Thank you to Yelp we found this gem.  The host was very prompt and the service was just the same.  The decor is very vibrant and plays well with the quality of food.  I loved that the chips were warm when they were brought to the table and they even use REAL napkins that are a fun colored pattern.  We tried the cheese queso, tamale plate and chicken chimichanga.  We were not disappointed with any of it.  Will stop by again when in the area."}
{"text":"Lunching with the folks is typically restricted to a few choice restaurants in the valley. They are vegan/vegetarian and prefer Mexican, True Food Kitchen or Pita Jungle. I can't tell you how many times we've dined at Restaurant Mexico, Serrano's etc. In an attempt to sway them toward some Mexican food that is above the mediocre requirements of some of the aforementioned names, we came to La Casa De Juana.   I must say that everyone was pleasantly greeted, our service was prompt and the food was quite good.   Carne Asada Burro Taco Salad w/Carne Asada Guacamole & Chips Tacos (all kinds)  The carne was well prepared and not full of gristle.  Taco salad shell was pretty burnt and dark brown, but everything inside was very fresh and had a nice balance (not overdressed). Guac had a nice flavor and the salsa was tomatillo and very good.  Tacos were done properly and had a good flavor.   Overall everything went well, they have cute glassware and the vibe is very Mexico! Flags, color and art even embedded into the booths. I'd say this is an excellent choice if you want some basic flavorful Mexican. This place is a family owned and operated establishment so I definitely support that!"}
{"text":"Love love their steak Fajitas !!! Been here a couple of times and that is all I get .   Restaurant is clean and the service is wonderful and fast!!  If your in the neighborhood stop by and give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Loved having so many vegetarian options and would go back for that alone. The chips and salsa were very good too! The service wasn't great, the server was nice just not very attentive. We also stood up front a long time waiting to be seated in an empty restaurant.  We only got one small salsa to start and had to ask another server for more. Then we only got one drink refill at the end of our meal with the check. The restaurant was not busy at all so I'm not sure why service was so poor.  We'll go again and give them another shot but if the service is the same we probably won't return."}
{"text":"My wife & I had a very pleasant surprise eating there this past week. The waiter was so NICE & PROMP with service & honest about the various dishes we asked about.  I wanted to try their Posole & I asked how big of servings they gave - cup or bowl. He showed me the 2 sizes Neither were very big so I passed but he brought me a sample (which was very good)  but the serving sizes were very stingy! Tacos were very good which I had & beans. My wife said her pork carnitas chimichanga was good I talked with the manager on leaving & suggested that they offer small, medium & large bowls of posole. He said he would visit with the owner about making a larger bowl available. La Sierra in Payson serves huge bowls of Posole & it's excellent. Owners need to drive up and try there's & check out their prices! Chips & Salsa very good!"}
{"text":"Mexican vegetarian food SUPERSTARS! This restaurant is a lot of fun. It is bright, with lots of sunlight and bold bright colors. So, right when you walk in, the experience is positive. The menu has a veggie section, and what is super cool is that these are not items you see everywhere. I can not remember the details, but there is a bu√±uelo dish. These are like little sopapillas. There is also a bean masa dish. Masa is the stuff tamales are made of. It is really unique, and good. This has become a favorite lunch spot.   The only thing I have ever tried there that was sub-par was the horchata. But it might have been a bad batch.  I would definitely recommend it., especially for veggies who would like a hassle-free vegetarian Mexican food experience."}
{"text":"Food not that good, service was good. Salsa no heat and only green salsa, margarita taste funny. This is not anything like New Mexico food"}
{"text":"Delicious array of Mexican style and American style food. Adorable, colorful and authentic artwork and attentive service.  I enjoyed the street taco plate,  complete with a healthy helping of guacamole, rice and beans. Affordably priced, quality meal- I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time there after a recommendation from friends. Food was great,  good value,  conciencious service. Cute decor - very festive. The only drawback was the booths wiggled everyone our neighbors would move.  The cloth napkins were a lovely touch."}
{"text":"First time going...amazing food everything was perfection...not only did I enjoy the food but the service was awesome. Both Hostess and waitress gave us the best service. Most definitely recommend this place. Oh and not to forget pricing is very affordable."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go and pretty disappointed. I was so excited to try this place..maybe I have to try it at the restaurant. But I ordered the quest fundido and no chips!! What am I supposed to eat it with??so that went to waste. My enchilada was really tough I expected it to be soggy from the length of time but I couldn't cut it. The tortilla for the quesadilla was very dry and very little cheese. The beans were pretty good but that's as much as I can say for now."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place since it opened up after Top Shelf closed down.  Salsa was good - not too much of a kick which I like.  I had the enchilada plate and the enchiladas were decent.  The waitress was absolutely awful.  She asked if we wanted more salsa and then never brought it.  I drank my water and she never once asked to refill it (and the cups are not that big).  We had better service from the waitress waiting on other tables than our own.  Will probably not be back with such horrible service."}
{"text":"Management is poor. Service is bad. Ordered a chimichanga and when it got to my house I had a regular burrito with nothing but pork in it. Also ordered green sauce. My food didn't come with it. Management refused to fix the problem and blamed the cooks. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"The food here was really good, ridiculously cheap, and the waitress was incredibly nice and accommodating with my friend's food allergies. The vegetarian enchiladas were delicious, filled with nicely roasted vegetables rather than just plain old beans and cheese like you often find. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Well, we liked it so much we returned on Saturday evening. I'm hoping that it is rarely used, but from where we sat you could clearly see a kitchen staff person using a dun, dun, dunnnnn... microwave. I guess I am crazy to think there should NOT be microwaves in restaurant kitchens, but alas, I saw it. And they had to correct my meal which came out on a very hot plate that I suspect was in said microwave. I'll be back, but I will request that only traditional cooking methods be used on my food. I'd rather have something luke warm than nuked. Lose the microwave, Juana! You're better than that."}
{"text":"We eat Mexican food VERY often,  and this place truly is a gem hidden in a shopping center. Im considering this place my favorite.  Aside from fresh and authenic great food, super cute decor,  very clean and friendly staff.  I ordered Carne Asada street tacos,  which are bigger then most places came with rice and beans. Seriously, delish! You won't be disappointed..oh, and they have coke not pepsi!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place because of their great reviews. I was very disappointed in everything from the service to the food. The only good thing they have going is their rice. Salsa was disgusting! The restaurant is gorgeous inside."}
{"text":"We have been to this location twice. This being the 2nd time. We had the worst, worst service. Waited 15 mins. before someone came to see if we had been helped. We were seated in the back both. There had been a large party that left and the table wasn't cleaned. It was obvious the large party and other tables threw them off. We waited 7 mins. to be seated. We ordered water and drinks. Drinks came - no water. No silver wear on our table. Had to ask for that. Food was good. We wanted to order more food and chips. Never got the chips. We also had to wait 15 mins. in order to place the 2nd order of food. We should have left from the start... our bad. Worst experience ever. We spent $69.35 and tipped the girl well. We aren't people that punish those that don't know better. We like the other location as well. We will be sure to go back there- ONLY. La Casa De Juana get it together huh"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The food is fantastic and fresh. I got the vegetarian burrito, which was full of saut√©ed veggies in a light sauce (not your typical rice, beans, and cheese). The boyfriend had carne asana tacos that he loved.   Our server Verenice was one of the best I've had in a while.   Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Used to be a loyal customer... Until we went on a Friday night. Disappointing service. We did not get greeted until 10 minutes later. Finally 20 minutes in we got seated. In hopes of a great experience we stayed. No one came over, other tables got chips and salsa before we did. Finally ordered and the food took so long that we change it to go. Got home and finally anxious to eat, I was very disappointed by the quality considering their prices."}
{"text":"This was a very good Mexican breakfast. Well worth it. Their salsa is to absolutely die for."}
{"text":"Mesa's biggest little secret is La Casa de Juana on Dobson and Southern! Gorgeous little restaurant with daily specials and an added bonus of a vegetarian menu with a lot of options! Their beans are lard free, the delicious salsa is made daily in house, and the drink specials from 2-6 are just some of the reasons why this place is so great!!! I'll let you in on another secret...they just opened The Upstairs Bar, which is literally upstairs! Go check it out! The people are amazing, the food is great, and I promise you will really love it!"}
{"text":"Seriously people...... you need to eat this yummy food right now! This place is amazingly delicious!!!!! Some of the best grinds we have had in a long time! I had the  shrimp tacos and my Hubby had the enchiladas and our taste buds were electrified by all the amazing flavors! The rice and beans were absolutely heavenly.  Staff is delightful and the decor is fun. We will definitely frequent this fine establishment."}
{"text":"I had previously ordered from the Tempe location via grubhub, but then the Tempe location stopped delivering to my location. I was a little hesitant to order from this location because I read another user's review that their chimichanga was not fried. Craving Mexican food, I decided to give this location a chance. I ordered the enchilada style pork carnitas chicmichanga and churros con cajetes. The pork carnitas chimichanga was delicious, tender meat and the right crisp to the fried tortilla exterior. I only docked one star because I ordered the chimichanga enchilada style and the sauce was separate from the chimichanga, I was expecting the chimichanga to have been smothered with sauce and baked with the sauce. The churros were delicious, crispy, sweet, creamy and having a nice taste of cinnamon. Next time, I will order shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"Had three flautas, one chimichanga, and horchata delivered to my home via Grubhub. I was initially skeptical about three flautas costing $7.95, however, when I received them, they came with sides such as vegetables as the chimichanga had. I really enjoyed the taste of the shredded beef in both the chimichanga and the flautas. Next time I will order carnitas chimichangas and fried ice cream. The delivery girl was also nice and punctual when delivering my food. My only complaint was the horchata. It did not have a distinctive cinnamon flavor, although, my real complaint is the cup size. The cup size leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant for the first time on a whim, just because it is close to MCC.  I was so impressed I am looking forward to my second visit.  I had spinach enchiladas.  I was expecting a cream sauce inside, like many I've had before.  Not here.  It was solid spinach - but very tasty spinach (not sure what other ingredients were in there).  I had them put the sauce on the side because I don't like spicey food.  So I can say there was a good flavor with no spice.  It was covered in melted cheese, which is a plus in my book!  The enchiladas came with rice, beans, and a lettuce salad.  Again, the salad had flavor - not just lettuce - but I'm not sure what was in it because it looked pretty much like lettuce.  For dessert I had apple empenadas.  Oh my - soooo good.  They were sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and the filling I think had cream cheese with the apple.  Besides the food, the atmosphere was nice.  The water glasses were solid and the cloth napkins were soft.  The music was not too loud.  Definitely worth going back."}
{"text":"I grew up in Arizona, heard many great reviews, so the anticipation was high. I was greatly disappointed with the quality of the food.  The chips were fresh, not stale; but the salsa was bland.  I ordered the carnitas burrito with green sauce - meat was burnt and very dry, green sauce was so-so. Ho-hum at best for me.  Two stars for the ambience, not the service or food."}
{"text":"Very festively decorated! We were seated right away on a Bust Saturday night. The chips and salsa were great! Their rice was delicious and I tried a bite of the beans and they were okay.  I think the combo plates are worth the $  I hope they hire more servers so they can provide better customer service. My cheese enchiladas were okay but they were cold because it took so long for them to bring a side of sour cream out.  Try both red and green sauce. The green had a nice flavor and the red was yummy."}
{"text":"The food was really good.  Different style of rice, I've never had it prepared this way but it was delicious.  Chips are light and fresh, salsa could use a bit more kick.  The Sangria was good the margarita not so much.  The restaurant itself is very colorful and the staff was good and friendly."}
{"text":"Cold food, slow service. Poor management. We tried this place three times and this was our last."}
{"text":"Began with a perfectly flavored salsa with bits of fresh nopal. Moved on to $2 beers, try the Victoria, and $3 margaritas, during happy hour that is. Then finished with their mole,which is hands down the best i've had in the states. Attentive,knowledgable service from genuinely friendly servers,awesome job Hyatt & Roberto!! My new favorite haunt...definately worth coming all the way from Baltimore for!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, extensive menu, took awhile to decide! Great place to go with family and friends - easy to have a conversation and share tastes from everyone's yummy plates!  From the Hostess'  welcoming smile, to the time you are ready to go, the evening is  Five Stars!  Hope you get Stephanie as your waitress, she is very attentive and sweet!"}
{"text":"First time here to meet another couple. You are greeted with very festive decor, bright and clean. The Margaritas are excellent, and the menu is extensive and varied. Chips and salsa are fresh and delicious. Stephen our server was excellent. Great place for the atmosphere and good service. We will be back even though it is a long drive."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch and was not impressed.  Food was average, they had GREEN colored rice(blah), service was mediocre,  and they didn't have sopapilla's!!!??  What kind of respectable Mexican restaurant does not have sopapilla's???  The ice tea was on point."}
{"text":"Omg so cute!!  I love the kitch.  Food was AMAZING- I'm super into enchiladas.  So glad I discovered this place, will go back!"}
{"text":"I recently went to La Casa De Juana with out of town company.  It is such a colorful place, and the food was good too.  We ordered two entrees and shared them.  One was the green corn tamales, and the other was the Mexican pizza, without any meat on it.  The service was good too.  I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.   I read the reviews and was looking forward to trying it out.  I'm Mexican and this was bad. The decor was over the top cheesy and everyone in our party of 4 commented on how dry and bland the food was. We each ordered something different so we know it's consistently sub par.  Margaritas are terrible, too. Also, someone needs to tell the waitresses you don't call someone twice your age \"kiddos\". Only nice part was the guy they had singing and playing a guitar."}
{"text":"**** - Decor **1/2 - Food **1/2 - Service Overall I would say it was okay, but I was not Wow'd or even inspired to come back \"real soon\". Growing up eating Mexican food,  and living more than half my life in the Southwest, I prefer a little more character in the food.   The Mexican Fried Rice had the most character because it's green.  I asked the waitress and was told Poblano and Cilantro, but I couldn't really tell. The rice was overcooked, but the flavor was alright.  The beans I would rate the lowest because they tasted like they were canned that were enhanced with just the sprinkle of cheese that's melted on top. We we pleasantly surprised by a dessert \"on the house\" that was simple and satisfying. A tiny flour tortilla filled with apple pie filling and a touch of cream/cheese, grilled like a quesadilla and then tossed in cinnamon sugar.  Mmm. I missed the fact they had a full bar.  Lots of temptation there.  Guess I may need to check out their happy hour deals. One last thing.  Our server was pleasant but so quiet and wasn't familiar with the specials.  She left without dropping the bill or telling us she was leaving -- so we waited for our check.  It was then I learned they had a full bar cuz I figured I needed to go to a register to pay. Gimme a server that is confident, brings some of that personality to her service and makes you glad you stopped in regardless of the food."}
{"text":"The restaurant is cheerfully redone from the former Top Shelf and we were greeted with smiles and given time to browse menus. The food was served pretty quickly. I thought the food was fresh and delicious. I think once the word gets out this will be a very popular place. I'm so glad they're in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Delish! Had an hour to pass and came for a salad. The salsa is fantastic and all very fresh! The server was attentive and great service."}
{"text":"The decor was beautiful,and very colorful,  the atmosphere and music was great, it was very clean, and the waiter was super. The menu is awesome, with a lot to choose from. The dishes and glasses are even nice, as are the colorful cloth napkins. All the hand-painted murals everywhere are beautiful too.  Everything about the restaurant is GREAT!!  Sadly, the food was the complete opposite. The chips were fresh, but the salsa had litte to no flavor, and the food was luke warm and tasted old and greasy,  like it had been reheated and was borderline ready to spoil.  The rice was bland and over cooked, being very mushy and the beans were so runny the they ran across the whole plate, in a thin, tasteless sludge. The street tacos had a lot of meat in them, but again, barely warm and tortillas tasted stale and weren't even warmed up so they wouldn't bend. The meat did have a good flavor though. My husband had the shredded beef chimichanga and said it was just ok. It was pretty greasy as well. We were really sad, because we had our first date here 22 years ago when it was a different restaurant. It was really good back then. This place could be awesome if they stepped it up on the food.  Everything else was great!"}
{"text":"The staff is always welcoming and friendly.  I usually get the one item plate, it is a good value and just the right amount. Best rice and beans anywhere, and the chips and salsa are good as well.  We come on Friday nights because they have live music.    Barbie"}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to Mexican food and I am always trying new places in hopes of finding my go to restaurant for authentic Mexican food. This place is it. I've finally found it. Their food is delicious! Most flavorful moist shredded beef.  The chile relleno is out of this world! They don't fry them which I love.  Everything is so fresh and the horchata is great. Also the servers are super friendly too. Believe me you will not be disappointed. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday evening and the place was pretty full. A couple entered the same time as us and were sat and greeted with chips and drinks. After we sat,  we were kinda looking around wondering why nobody was greeting us. Two more couples came in and were given chips before us. I told my boyfriend that if they didnt come over in two minutes we were leaving.  All of sudden they greeted us so we were stuck.  We ordered an appetizer and waited  for it to arrive while everyone who came in AFTER us was finishing their entree and waiting for their bill.  We were beyond frustrated. The appetizer was nothing but thick melted cheese on a skillet. We thought it would be more of a thick dip.  After everyone else left we got our  food.  The people that came in 20 minutes after us got their food two minutes after us.   I asked for sour cream with my order and when i got my plate there wasnt any. Considering they Charge $1 ud think they'd remember that.  Portions were kind of small. my burrito was soggy and i couldn't eat the ends becuz they were so doughy.   The reason we came here was becuz the pollack cinema had an ad that u could get $2 off per entree with ticket.  I tried to use and girl said it has to be used the same day as ur movie. The ad at  the movie does not say that. Total bait and switch. Like perfect definition of it. Girl heard me complain and came back saying she would take it. I told her it was ok and not to worry about it (Becuz another table was staring at me and i didnt wanna seem cheap or like a baby.)   We had three different people wait on us so maybe that had something to do with our poor experience"}
{"text":"I heard some rave reviews from people at church regarding this place and since it's only a couple doors down from our church, thought, why not?  I wanted to invite some others from church to join us for lunch, but my husband was already overwhelmed, so we decided to just go ourselves.  Loved the decor, which the place is very bright and clean with lots of beautiful things.  Loved the chairs and tables, that had colorful Mexican type art.  My son took a lot of pictures and that just made us seem so Asian, but he, we love our cameras.  Loved the glasses that our water and sodas came in.  I thought the prices would be a little less as people from my church said it was cheap, but we don't really eat Mexican and I thought cheap meant like $4-7 range.  That it was not, but closer to near the $10 range, but not a big deal.  We liked the tortilla chips that came out in a cute basket and the addicting salsa in cute little salsa bowls.  I could've just eaten this for lunch.  Really loved the colorfulness of this restaurant.  It would have been nice had they proved spoons with the salsa.  The napkins were colorful cloth napkins, which were nice, but I think I still like paper napkins better, but that's not really a big issue.  Each of the kids ordered a 3 enchiladas and they got a mixture of cheese, beef, and chicken and the waitress only charged us $8.95 for each of their items.  It also came with rice and beans.  The rice was a different type of rice rather than the orangish Mexican rice normally served at many gringo style Mexican restaurants.  This was more of a poblano, cilantro rice, which was good, but needed more salt.  Each plate had refried beans topped with cheese (well, three of the four plates had cheese topping the refried beans).  This was the only thing that wasn't too great and I would have preferred black beans or something that wasn't so pastey thick.  My husband ordered 3 street steak tacos (rib eye) and these came with plenty of beef, which he liked.  Each dish had some pico de gallo, and I wished this was more.  He liked the tacos.  I ordered a 3 item plate consisting of a carnitas taco, chicken tamale and a chili relleno .  I was glad the chili relleno wasn't breaded, as it's normally so this made it less greasy.  I liked the taste of the taco, which was not a soft taco, but where the shell is deep fried with the meat in it.  I think they could have put more carnitas in the taco, though.  Did not get to eat the chicken tamale as 1 taco and 1/2 of the relleno.  Ate all my beans, and a little of the rice and I was totally stuffed.  My son was able to eat most of his food, minus one enchilada of the three and my daughter ate all her plate.  My husband ate all his tacos and most of the rice and beans.  As we were nearly done with our food, quite a few people from our church showed up and the restaurant was starting to have a little bit more action.  We were the only ones here for most of the time we were here.    Will be back.  The service was good, the waitress attentive to our needs.  No issues here."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant. Great food and service. Fun, relaxed family friendly atmosphere.  They have really good chips and salsa and unique, delicious rice. This location had music on Sunday and the other location had music on Friday and Saturday. He had a beautiful voice and gr at talent on the guitar. They have great happy hour and daily specials too. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Ordered and paid for enchilada style chimichanga Order arrived almost cold and though we paid extra for enchilada style I came plain. Won't order here again."}
{"text":"I stepped into a colourful atmosphere with yellow walls, Mexican painted mural on the walls, colourful banners hanging from the ceiling and pleasant Mexican music playing.  The table and chairs are beautiful with a Mexican painting on each and finished with high gloss sealant.  It is very clean. The staff friendly.   I had not ordered a Mexican Pizza in a very long time so I decided I would get the Beef Mexican Pizza. To my surprise it was huge. The size of a cheese crisp. Ones I ordered at other places were personal pizza size on a thicker crust.   The crust was thin on this one which is a problem BC all those toppings made it soggy. This item should be served on a thicker crust or Indian Fry Bread. Aside from the soggyness, the flavor was very good.   The rice was different from what I'm used too. It was green in color with corn and green chilies. Tasted fine but I really like the regular rice better.  Daughter order 3 chicken tacos, rice and beans which was a shocker BC 99.8% of the time she gets a cheese crisp. . The chicken was fresh and flavorful.  Honestly everything had good flavor.  If you like Serrano's, I think you'll like this place a little better."}
{"text":"When Mexicans eat at a Mexican restaurant, you KNOW it's good food! Great ambiance, live music, waitress with an awesome sense of humor, super Margaritas and last, but not least, great food. Must see, must go, must eat!"}
{"text":"Order dinner for delivery for the first time and it was delicious. Coming from Mexican roots it has always been very difficult to find a good Mexican food restaurant but, just found it!! The beans at other restaurants are always so gross cause they are caned beans. I really don't know if they use can beans but they are delicious they taste just like grandma makes them. We will be ordering from them more. Will highly recommend to my friends they always ask me which Mexican restaurants are good could never recommend one now I can."}
{"text":"We saw great reviews for Casa De Juana and decided to give it a try. We will be back! The inside of the restaurant was colorful and bright and we had a lot of fun with the decor. My house Margarita was just right, tangy, sweet, just enough ice and not watered down. My husband ordered the appetizer platter, which contained the best Tamale I have eaten in many years. Their guacamole was fresh and chunky and the house salsa was just spicy enough with a smokey roasted flavor- top notch!  All of us had the Friday evening special which was a chimichanga with beans and rice. Two of us had the pork Carnitas chimi and my husband had the beef chimi. The outside was extremely crispy without being burned in the least. The rice was outstanding and the beans were creamy and flavorful. The restaurant was very busy, and their staff was stretched a little thin but the wait was so well worth the wait. There was a wonderful guitar player also performing, certainly a nice touch."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for some good Mole and will try it over just about any other dish. If a new location has it on the menu, it's the first thing I order.       Why you ask? Because a good Mole is hard to find. If it's good, that tells me allot about the recipes, cook staff and how important the food and customers are the the owners.      To be honest, I was WOWed! It's been a long time since I've had a Mole this rich and flavorful. It was hearty with the combination of chili's and spices with just the right amount of chocolaty richness to blend it all together. My son was upset I hadn't mention this dish to him after he took a bit of mine.      Other dishes ordered were Enchiladas which my wife and son devoured. She said it was one of the best red sauces she has ever had.       The one item that kept disappearing was the Salsa. It was a wonderful blend of roasted peppers and other ingredients. It wasn't hot but packed a punch in the flavor department. So much so, the I took a pint home and got in trouble for eating most of it. Which was fine since I paid for dinner.      This just maybe our new Mexican food hangout. Keep your sunglasses handy, the decor is bright and friendly."}
{"text":"We stepped inside for dinner after a long work day, eager to try this new restaurant. In addition to your standard burritos, chimichangas, and tacos, they also offer options like sopes and have a small American style menu for those not wishing to eat Mexican food at a Mexican restaurant :).   We were seated immediately at a bright, comfortable booth. The decor is very festive and lively, with warm gold and yellow tones echoing throughout the restaurant. I loved the atmosphere, the unique tables, and the vivid, multi-colored cloth napkins. As soon as we were seated we received some chips and salsa. Both were quite good. The salsa was green and was filled with fire roasted green chiles, adding a nice spicy kick to go with the light, crisp chips. We looked through the menu and I decided on a 2 item combination plate ($8.95) with chile relleno and chicken enchilada, and. I also tried some carnitas chimichanga.   The chile relleno is a lighter version of what I usually see in restaurants. The poblano chile is not breaded and fried, but still stuffed with cheese. I enjoyed it, as the chile was perfectly cooked with good flavor. The chicken enchilada was filled with shredded white meat chicken. Again, it tasted like a lighter version of what I usually see in most restaurants. The rice was green, which was a unique twist, and had a more delicate flavor. The refried beans were decent, no complaints. The carnitas chimichanga was filled with tender carnitas pork, and I could taste a hint of cumin in the mix. Like the other components of my meal, this dish also had more of a delicate flavor.  Service was friendly and cheerful and we were checked on as needed.   They also have a breakfast menu that I might like to try some day. If you're looking for lighter tasting versions of Mexican favorites in a sunny, cheerful atmosphere, you've come to the right place!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice recently and enjoy it. The atmosphere is very nice with awesome painted tables and chairs. The deco is wonderful throughout. My wife likes the lime citrus chicken and I have had the mole each time. Chips and salsa, some low beer prices, and overall not too expensive. Our last visit we had two entrees, a coke, a beer, and a jalapeno margarita for about $30."}
{"text":"This place is brand new, just opened. It is amazing. The food is excellent. It was nice and hot, we ordered the shrimp quesadillas, and shrimp tacos. They serve cilantro rice with all dishes labeled with \"beans and rice.\" It's very good. The service was quick. Dining here will not break the budget, they also have an upstairs and outside eating area. Also kid friendly. The decor inside is gorgeous!! Don't miss out on this great new place. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, I would give it a 4 Star rating. Service is questionable at times so I would give them a 2 star for that.    On multiple times that I've been there I waited for 35 to 40 minutes to be served will other patrons that came in well after I did were served before me for the same comparable meal.  I don't blame the servers but I blame the management.  So I'll give them a 3 star rating.   Don't eat there if ur in a hurry."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service...I came across this place through their advertisement on Clipper magazine....called to order takeout....the person on phone looked busy and said she was the only one on floors and let me point out it was a Sunday afternoon...she was new and uninformed about their menu deals...i asked about the specials and she was unaware about anything....she was EXTREMELY rude while answering me and did not seem to care about taking the order...I decided to cancel my decision to order and hung up....I then took my business elsewhere to another Mexican restaurant...will never try this place again!!!"}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday afternoon and it was not that busy. It is very clean and had good service. I drank water and ordered the chicken mole. They brought out chips and salsa as I waited. They never left me without water. The mole came with beans and rice and tortillas. It was very good and worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is so good & anyone who complains are just nitpicky. I feel sorry for those ppl. ANYHOO! My best friend & I went this past Saturday afternoon. The food was on point. There was only one server and no other customers around. She was attentive and polite. Hats off, or shall I say, sombreros off to the cook that day."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The beer is served in iced cold glasses that crystalize the cold beer on the top of the glass. Their happy hour specials are some of the best in the valley...any beer $2 a glass... . My favorite dish here are the beef, chicken or pork nopalitos. They are served with a side of refried beans and rice. The salsa is ok, and the tortillas are not homemade (my only complaint). The service is always great and the waitresses we've had have always been great. I have taken many friends to this place to grab a quick bite and some cold beers with never a negative comment. I am surprised this place is never jam packed considering their prices, food and good service."}
{"text":"I just order from the yelp website.. first on your order yelp will Only apply $5 coupon  m  you use your credit card or debt card. That's sucks.. next it says delivery is free when finishing the order there is a delivery fee.. Prices are fair on the menu. I like that this restaurant has a vegetarian menu.The menu has most off the traditional dishes and food looks very fresh in the pictures..  Update: I waited one hour so I called the place: \"Where is my food?\"  Sorry we don't have any delivery drivers right now.. We cancel your oder. Well why didn't I get a call? you didn't yelp should have called you.. Do you want me to see if Tempe can take your order? Yes..!! but how long in till I get my order?.. Well we need to make it.. OK I would like to cancel. Phone Click!!!! Im not ordering again.. Update 2: after ordering in yelp 1:30 mins a delivery guy showed up.. Delivery!  \"I'm sorry I already cancel my order and I order pizza\" I felt bad he said no one told him..  No communication I'll give them a 5 star for at least trying!  To bring the food.. after so long. But I did cancel."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh, food is tasty, clean and service is great! We will be back for sure. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here about five times now.  Each time we are here, we think to ourselves \" Was it really that good...AGAIN?\" Each time we say \"YES!!  La Casa De Juana strikes again! So this time it was me, my wife and our 22 month old. We got our favorite server, who our son immediately recognized!  This time I got the Cilantro Cream Chicken. And again, I was amazed. Diced chicken with onion and peppers in a supper yummy cream sauce! The usual rice and beans came with it....but there is nothing USUAL about their rice!  My wife got the carnitas tacos.  DELISH! The meat was so tender, and I love the taco shells!  See you next time!"}
{"text":"Came here last weekend with my husband. Salsa and chips were great and very fresh. Salsa had great flavor.  I ordered sopes beans and rice and my husband ordered four tacos with beans and rice. All was very very good. Love to support a local restaurant near home will be coming back eventually"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food is always amazing and the waitress that is always there is great!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is decorated well, the staff are friendly, chips and salsa are very good, and the food is delicious. I'm not sure why but I felt a little rushed eating my meal, maybe that had something to do with the music which was playing, maybe it was a little fast, but that doesn't really matter because I enjoyed my meal. I see no reason why this restaurant could not be filled to capacity often.  I think this is the kind a restaurant that's a gem that you like to return to often to enjoy good food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I usually give good reviews of course but IMHO it's my first time to try this place and it's no bueno i had the chichen chimichanga with rice.  Chimi was dry and rice was not hot not warm. But a lil cold.   I only had like 3 bites and that's it. Water tastes like bleh.   My daughter didn't like it either.  So no stars this time .  maybe 2 stars for the friendly staff and the presentation.  .  I'll give it another chance though I'll maybe come back to try their tacos."}
{"text":"OMG!  I am so driving here from now on for my Mexican food fix...40 minute drive so worth it!  The salsa is fresh ridiculously good and chip awesome!  I ordered the shrimp diablo which was INSANELY GOOD!  Tons of shrimp, peppers, refried beans, and cilantro Mexican rice.  The burros are awesome and of course my little man had a cheeseburger and he loves that as well.  Everyone talks about the margaritas on yelp and they should.::they are killer! Our waitress Hyatt was the bomb!  Told us about specialties and was so friendly and welcoming.  We never order desert and we had the caramel churros on hyatts recommendation and well worth the calories.  My final comment, LOVE the guitarist that strolls through the restaurant.  Unreal you have to come here!"}
{"text":"Very fast seating and we got our food immediately! It was my first time coming in and will not be my last. The decor was very vibrant and cozy. The food was phenomenal and was brought out very quickly. The reason for the four stars is because the tables are too short. My family and I had to bend down more than usual to eat our food. They are very nice and jovial. I recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere, great happy hour and a fresher Mexican food alternative to some greasy places. I don't recommend their enchiladas as they are soooo small and the tortillas seem too hard for my preference. Pineapple margarita is delicious and refreshing."}
{"text":"One of many things to remember as a restaurateur or employee thereof , is whether stated or not, always assume, if you didn't ask, that the people there M-F for lunch, have to be back to work in 1 hour.  My employer moved into a new building a couple months ago so I have been using Yelp to find new places within the vicinity; not right next door to work.  A small group of coworkers and I regularly go out to eat a couple times a week.  La Casa De Juana on the corner of McClintock and Elliot was my choice today.  We walked in and were seated promptly.  It took about 5 minutes before anyone came to the table to offer menus or drinks; another ten minutes before our sodas came.  The waiter took our order and brought us our second bowl of chips and salsa.  My coworker had checked his voicemail when we first sat down and upon the discussion of wondering how long we had been there he confirmed on his phone that it was just over 30 minutes ago when we sat down.  I made the suggestion that we leave at this point since one of our coworkers was hourly and only had 60 minutes for lunch.  We waited probably another 5 minutes.  I stood up, put $5 down on the table to cover the 4 sodas, and we walked out unnoticed by any staff. This is a small restaurant which based on the only 2 staff that I saw, was way understaffed regardless of the size of the building.  The chips and salsa we all agreed were very good, but the service was simply ridiculously unacceptable.  Some would say that it wasn't the servers fault.  I say it was.  There are a lot of things that go wrong at any given moment in the restaurant industry and there are always options for the staff to try and make it better for the customer.  Even an apology for the lack of attention at our table would have been a start.  If someone had called out sick, where was the back-up, or management, to help cover?  Regardless of the reason, lack of planning is what caused this train wreck.  I don't know what it is about the Phoenix area that customer service is so low.  In my almost 6 years of living here I have never come across such utter failures in the industry and customer service in general, as often as I have here. Advice for anyone working in a restaurant that offers free chips and salsa: there are always too many chips and not enough salsa, and if you are busy and going to be unable to provide proper customer service, load your customers up on drinks, chips, and salsa, and there is a good chance that will appease them until you can.  One more thing, the way the menu is printed is horrible.  The wording is jumbled and with the font, print size, and color choices, it's obvious a non-professional or newbie restaurateur designed this menu.  It is hard to read and very busy."}
{"text":"My only hope is that more people don't come here creating a wait food is always amazing next best mexican food 286 miles away in Mexico"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is authentic and so are the people. Today (Sunday afternoon) I walked in and they had live music. Nice touch."}
{"text":"Ok we just left this place have to say the service was AWSOME thanks Karina..I had a horchata and a Jamaica Aguas fresca(Mexican drinks) they where ok they where in the too watery side and too sweet not used to what I had before.We had a appetizer of their guac it was very good chunky good, I had the enchilada combo the food was kinda on the cold side not to hot or cold,It might of been sitting for a few mins but other than that it was good have the 4 stars mostly for the service and the decor inside and out of the restaurant it wasn't bad at all don't get me wrong they just opened not to long I will definitely give them a second chance Check out my pics I posted."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, and loved it! The decor was so fun and colorful, and the staff were so nice and friendly. They were pretty busy, but I felt we still had great service. Our food was great, and the fried ice cream was amazing! I'd definitely recommend this place for a solid Mexican meal."}
{"text":"We ordered from casa de Juana and picked up our food! I had to wait a few minutes, which was fine with me.  My boyfriend ordered a 3 item platter and enjoyed his meal. I ordered a chimichanga with sour cream inside. I feel like all of the sour cream was on one side of the chimi, and I was not a fan of the flavor of the rice. Besides that, my meal was pretty tasty as well. We will probably eat here again."}
{"text":"I try to see the best in every place I go. I really do! The atmosphere of this place is fun, festive, and makes you feel like you're really immersed in the culture. All of the colors are vibrant and the music is amazing. However, a restaurant also needs food service and good food - which La Casa De Juana lacked. Big time.   When we arrived, we were greeted and sat at a booth. We got there around 3:30 PM on a Wednesday afternoon, and it was dead. There was maybe another couple, and a regular at the bar. The waitress was nice enough, didn't rush us into ordering. However, the service was slow. Maybe a rush WAS in order? It wasn't horrible, but it felt like we were an after thought to Alma, the waitress.   We ordered some drinks and some appetizers. The food was okay, the margaritas were huge, but the nachos were soggy (and had everything on them that we asked not be on there). We wanted dinner, but there was a waitress swap and then we were given an even worse waitress.   This waitress stopped and asked how we were doing, and I think that's about all she asked. I felt like we had to beg for drink refills, and again, we waited for centuries to even be helped. By that time, we decided to go to another restaurant because we had spent about an hour and a half in there, with only one drink and one appetizer, and no dinner in sight.   So in short, margaritas were fine, nachos were soggy, waitresses were young girls who really couldn't care less about the service, which in turn really sullied our experience. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. The service leaves something to be desired. I will probably come back for carryout, not sure I'd dine in again."}
{"text":"When you think of Mexico, you think of colorful buildings and women in creative colorful skirts and wear and you think of festival and festivities and la Casa de aya (Juana) definitely represents that! This place is like Mexico in Mesa! The food is like just about every mexican place, - GOOD and seasoned so good and spicey, how its suppose to be like that good as cilantro rice, Love the decor and the colors. You actually feel like a tourist here looking around at some very nice and FREE ART that you would see at a museum,"}
{"text":"the food was okay, the server was not very nice and made my lunch out with my two sons age 9 and 13 not very memorable. We most likely wont be back do to him."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place more stars! The service was extremely slow. Restaurant has a nice set up and the free chips are always a bonus. However they were quiet bland. When the food finally came out I was impressed with the appearance. The enchiladas were good for there price of $7, however the sopas were over cooked."}
{"text":"What a great spot! I actually didn't realize that they have two locations. I was searching out their other location, in Mesa, when I found this one actually nearly across the street from my house. Although not quite as big as their other location, this one has the same wonderfully painted bright walls, napkins, tables and decorations.  I agree with a previous comment about the veggie selection, I love when Mexican food restaurants have veg-friendly options! I got the Veggie burrito and it was pretty fantastic. Others in my group ordered the Street Tacos, chicken tacos and chili relleno and were also impressed. The margaritas are great (the strawberry ones are super sweet!) and the they even have a jalape√±o margarita that we were too chicken to try this time around.   It was Mother's Day so we were really excited with a live musician began playing with a fantastic voice and mad guitar skills. What a great find!"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. Never again. Got there Sunday at 1215 and  3 tables sat down about 15 minutes after us.  All 3 tables got food and left before our food ever came. Also messed up one entree and had to redo.  Took a total of 2 hours to eat. If they want to stay open they better work on service. Food was ok  server polite but extremely slow.  Will not go back.   If you have 2 hours and enjoying watching others get served and eat before then this is your place."}
{"text":"I've gone a few times. Love how very colorful the restaurant is - from their furniture, decor even to their napkins! When they 1st open my BF and I thought they were going to change from cloth napkins to paper napkins but that's not case! I've had their seafood and I wasn't a fan. I've learned to stick with their Fajitas. It's a big portion and my BF and I can share it. Our kids love their chips."}
{"text":"Awesome! We had to try this since we came to Top Shelf years ago at this location. The decor is bright, beautiful and authentically Mexican. The salsa is fresh with a medium heat and the Margarita was equally good. My order of shrimp ceviche tostadas on 3 small crisp tortillas was piled high with tasty shrimp ceviche topped with mangos and an avocado slice. Absolutely marvelous!  The flan we shared for dessert was rich and thickly textured - almost cheesecake like. They had a Mexican singer/guitarist who sang songs which were mellow enough to be a muted background. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"NO! Just NO!! 4 stars??? Really?!?! I went here with my family based on Yelp reviews. We were excited for the possibility of having a good Mexican food spot fairly close to home. We were extremely disappointed. We were given a small serving of chips and salsa for a family of five, had to ask for a refill, food took forever to be served once ordered (the restaurant was empty), food was barely warm, flavor was bland, the picture in the menu showed that my dish came with sour cream...it didn't and then was told that I would have to pay extra if I wanted it, soda was served in a small glass and kept having to flag the waitress down to ask for refills instead of being checked on and offered a refill. The decor was colorful and fun, but the food and service were blah at best!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Everything we ate was good and the staff was super friendly. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the margaritas were mediocre, but I shouldn't really complain since they were only $3. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Comida autentica Mexicana!! Filibertos ya no mas!! The server was prompt and polite with fantastic meal suggestions. The food was well prepared and beautifully presented. It seemed like anything one would chose couldn't go wrong. And yes, the fire roasted chile salsa is to die for. I bought a jar of it to take home with me."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to find a Mexican Restaurant that I like and want to continue to go back to.  I'm glad I finally found that place close to home!  This place is clean, beautifully and brightly decorated, and has super friendly employees.  The salsa that comes with the usual chips and salsa is fresh and yummy!  My boyfriend and I have been here a few times and although everything has been great, the items that stand out to me are their shrimp chimichanga enchilada style (green sauce) and their pozole.  My boyfriend agrees and has vowed we will visit the restaurant once a month just to have them!  Oh, the rice and beans that come with each dish are delicious, too!  If you want a casual, relaxed dining experience in a place that feels warm...where the food is good and the staff are really nice...then you should give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I have dined here a few times and each time I do, I hope it survives (as many restaurants don't...even good ones). The decor is colorful, bright, and vibrant. The staff is friendly, and the food is good. For me it's more authentic and much more flavorful than many of the chain restaurants in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My in-laws recommended this place to me and I live very close by.  They really enjoyed it when they lived in Arizona and now miss it.  My family was converted from first visit! Have been here multiple times now for take out. Since I have little ones at home, I haven't had the pleasure of dining in yet.  This review is long overdue.  The food here is very tasty! They use better ingredients then others and have higher quality meat.  We've cheated on them once and never again! We thought we'd try another place close by with high reviews and they didn't even come close to taste and quality.  My husband is a big fan of the steak fajitas and I usually go for the 3 choice platter and change it up.  Haven't been disappointed with my choices yet.  Not only is the food good, but they have wonderful staff and made each visit pleasant.  I was impressed they knew me by name by my second visit there.  On my third visit, I didn't order the usual kids meal with Sprite I get for my little girl.  When I arrived with her for my food, the manager offered her a Sprite despite not ordering one since he knew she liked it.  Totally impressed he not only recognized me again after just two visits, but he knew she looked forward to the Sprite I usually got her.  This is our only place we go to for mexican food now.  We won't even get it when we go out of town since La Cas de Juana has set the bar so high!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but I will never be back due to the service. Waited 10 min. Just to be greeted to pick up my take out. Then I watched her enter my order. I asked if she was only now entering my order and she said no, but then I proceeded to wait 30 minutes for an order placed 30 min ago. No apology no concern and certainly not worthy of being in the service industry."}
{"text":"First time I went here it was great. The second time service was terrible due to long waits for waitress to come by even though the place wasn't busy. Food was ok. Third time food was terrible. Nice atmosphere but food isn't that good. Not consistent"}
{"text":"Very good ambience & terrific decor. The food was lacking in original flavor however. The ribeye tacos were almost inedible. The meat was tough and fibrous.  The carnitas was unlike any I've ever had before - not much flavor & strange tomato sauce in it. Also, portions were not very generous."}
{"text":"Came in for their happy hour margaritas  $3bucks for a really decent size. Salsa very tasty. Not spicy good for gringos. Personally I like spicy but good flavor. My waiter checked on me onces and has not been back sense. My drink and  salsa has bye dry for over 35min. I was going to order food but know I'm just upset at the poor service on just want to leave.  Okeay drinks Good salsa Horrible service I said I would give this place a 2nd try and you have let me down both times. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for lunch several times and it's AWESOME. Lunch specials are a great value and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Second time and as money as the first. Had to actually post a photo of Juans Monster burrito,  chicken , steak, and shrimp with all the goods. You could literally hit someone with this thing and kill their dog it's so big lol taste was all their too. Wings as an appetizer were pretty good too, not the best but worthy of trying. Friendly service again, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Greeted by a very nice and friendly waitress. Food was excellent. A little different to what I'm use to but good. Beautiful Decor."}
{"text":"We ordered several items for delivery and I will never be ordering from this place again!  I ordered the shrimp tacos and was really excited when I read \"shrimp grilled served with our cabbage mix and chipotle dressing\"...That was definitely not what I received. I got shrimp in a cold corn tortilla. That's it. No cabbage mix, no chipotle dressing. It was shrimp in a tortilla that I paid $10 for. There was no flavor to anything, it was dry and I'm pretty sure I'm on the verge of food poisoning (Yes, I'm typing this 30 minutes after attempting to eat their food).  A vegetarian in our group ordered 3 cheese enchiladas and one of us ordered 3 chicken enchiladas, we got 6 chicken enchiladas. So, one of us couldn't even eat because when I called, rather than attempting to correct the issue, they said \"the cooks said they made 3 cheese and 3 chicken.\" I understand that they probably made them, but that's not what was delivered.  I also ordered an order of their bunuelos and I didn't receive them. Their response to that was \"you'll have to contact eatstreet for a refund.\"   I'm very disappointed I spent $70 on food (including a hefty tip for the driver) and this is the kind of service I received. I will definitely never eat here again. No thanks, but thank you for the food poisoning!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant on grubhub and Holy crap is my tummy happy! The vegetarian menu was a home run! Delivery was half of the expected time and everything was fresh! The healthy alternatives were so refreshing! Thank you for the awesome food and service!"}
{"text":"So happy I came! This food is amazing! I built my own dish, 1 chicken flauta, 1 chicken tamale, 1 pork sope, rice & beans. Very fairly priced, great food, super authentic, big portions - I had a huge dish full of food. One person ordered the Mexican pizza and it could have made a great appetizer for everyone at the table (party of 6) - it was huge! Started getting busy right after we got here, which is always a good sign. The staff is great!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times now. I live their chips and salsa, and we request the spicy salsa too. Their Guacamole is really good too. They have a large menu and everything I've had has been good. They have a pretty big selection of vegetarian dishes too.  The only dish that wasn't exactly what I was expecting was the cilantro chicken. I thought it was going to be a chicken breast or chicken strips with the sauce over it, but it was actually diced and mixed with the sauce and bell peppers and onions - I don't think I read the description properly. It was still good, just not what I was expecting. I love their rice - it is my favorite of any Mexican food place!  The decor is colorful and bright. I've also been there once when they had someone playing live guitar music - awesome."}
{"text":"I love mexican food, so I was very excited to try this place. And since it was so close to my home, I knew it would be a match made in Heaven. Sadly, it was not. I went on a Thursday and as soon as I walked in, I was obsessed with the decor. I liked how nice the hostess was and I was seated to my table quickly. As time passed, our server showed and asked for our drinks. About 10 minutes passed and we had not received our drinks. The server came back and we ordered. I had ordered the Two Entree plate and asked for a tamale. Our server told us that they had run out of tamales because it was \"Tamale Thursday\". I was pretty upset but I settled for a tostada. She also had realized that she did not bring the drinks but she fixed that very quickly. 5 minutes after we've ordered, she comes back to tell us that they ran out of rice.  This is where I was a little disappointed.  I could understand running out of tamales because of the special they had, but to run out of rice? That is a main part of a Mexican dish. I had never been to a Mexican restaurant where they ran out of rice.  To replace the rice, they added more beans.  I really liked the scenery and the people at this place, but I was not too impressed with the how we were told we could not have something AFTER we already asked for it.  Maybe I'll try a tamale from there on a Monday or something."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant - good food, great service, and nice decor.  Happy to have it in the neighborhood!  I've already been twice and will be back again."}
{"text":"As we weren't in the mood to go out tonight...ok it's a football night! We decided to order delivery. We didn't want the same ole pizza or sammys so we tried the little brother app to Yelp called Eat24. That app lists all delivery and take out restaurants. We had never tried this place before but most of the reviews were great.  We ordered three entr√©e dinners. I had the biggest tamale I've ever had in my life. As I had let my hubby order for me I thought it was a burrito! And so full of chicken. And obviously not too much masa. The cheese chilies releno (can't spell) was not breaded. This was awesome. My taco was not the best but that was completely MY fault. I left it in the container too long and it became chewie. But what was in it was great.  Lime rice and beans completed the dinners.   We will continue to try new things at this location and even stop in.  Great Dinner!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 meat Fajitas and a house salad.  The Fajitas were ok but way overpriced for what you received.  When I order and entree from a Mexican Restaurant they always give chips and salsa but not here.  The house salad described on their menu claims a spring mix but was just chopped romaine that was brown around the edges and went straight into the garbage.  Definitely overpriced on the salad.  Not sure if I will be ordering again from here."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food and a very authentic feeling environment! Very kid friendly and the salsa is so fresh!"}
{"text":"So far so good. My 3rd time here and finally I decided to leave a review. Margaritas are on point, they serve authentic salsa, and the decor makes it seem like I am visiting and eating at a restaurant in Mexico. Me and my girlfriend absolutely dig this place. Food is always good and freshly made.   Service is not too shabby, although it's a restaurant and service should be great! We let the food talk about how good the place is; and its exceptionally good"}
{"text":"Met up with Aileen B here last Thursday for dinner. I ordered the Mini Chimis  bc I was craving and they were decent but not the best I've had. Aileen had the Chili Relleno.  Overall I would say the food was good but nothing really stood out for me.  So I would say it's a 3-3.5 for now. The servers are friendly and cute place."}
{"text":"As far as Mexican food in AZ goes, this place is mediocre. I have been a couple of times and my office has catered, nothing great, just meh"}
{"text":"Love this place. The margaritas are really good and so is the food. Definitely my go to spot for some good mexican food"}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food.  Highly recommend the green sauce.  Also have a good lunch special.  Nice new place in our hood."}
{"text":"With a name like Casa de Juana, we knew we couldn't go wrong. Every morsel was an explosion of expertly crafted authentic Mexican flavor. 10/10 would eat again. The margaritas were phenomenal and they were so generous wth the portions. We tried the strawberry marg and the pineapple mango marg. I would highly recommend them both! The atmosphere was the real deal. They had live music going from table to table. We got the queso, which had a generous portion of chorizo, cheese enchiladas (get the red sauce!), chicken chimichanga (fried to perfection!), and the vegetable quesadilla  (great flavor and veggies).  The waitress was so helpful and we wished we stayed for dessert but we were too full to get anything else!!"}
{"text":"Very difficult decision here. Let's start with the beginning. I read on yelp how great the food was so we decided to check it out. After sitting down everything seemed to be what you would expect from a normal dining experience. First came the chips and salsa which were above average. The salsa was actually very very good. Unfortunately for us we had finished the entire basket of chips and salsa before we got our drinks and this sadly became a recurring theme. I watched 3 staff servers sit at the bar checking their cell phones as our margaritas slowly melted away on the bar top. The telephone would continuously ring as the hostess failed to answer. Other staff filled empty tables with napkins and silverware. While this was fairly entertaining I could only think of taking a few gulps of cold water to soothe my burning mouth from the aforementioned salsa. Finally we asked our server for our drinks. By this time our food had already been served. Unsurprisingly this was the saving grace because the food was genuinely tremendous. Nothing out of a freezer or microwave. Everything was prepared fresh and was very obvious whoever was in the kitchen had some serious skills. Honestly if it wasn't for the awful service I would give this place 5 stars. If you're in the neighborhood stop in and give it a try but wouldn't waste time driving across town."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.   We love the rib eye fajitas.    The service is excellent and they treat you like they are your family.    We recommend this place to everyone.  Wish we lived closer...we would visit more often.   The restaurant decor is clean, vibrant and welcoming to everyone visiting the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. They were busy but we didn't wait long to be seated.   I got the sopes. Similar to a tostada but instead of a tortilla the base is masa & about the size of a coaster. The meat was nicely seasoned and the toppings just the right amount. My husband got a chicken burrito with rice and beans. He said everything tasted good.   Our server was nice and friendly. They also had a gentlemen walking around playing the guitar and he would take requests.   The prices are reasonable and the food comes out very quick!"}
{"text":"I hate giving this place two stars because the waitress was really awesome, the restaurant was very clean and festive but the food was not good at all.  My family and I decided to try this place for their happy hour.    I ordered the grilled jalapenos which is described on their menu as  grilled jalapenos stuffed with a blend of Monterrey and jack cheese, wrapped in bacon and finished with a cilantro dressing.....sounds good right?......what I actually got were six sorry excuses for jalapenos, burned at the bottom, seeds NOT removed with sprinkled cheese and bacon bits!  Not wrapped in bacon and because of the seeds they were so hot you could not eat them.  The next item I ordered was Juana's combo platter.  This came with a tamale, 2 mini chicken chimi's, 2 taquitos, a mini quesadilla and guacamole.  Sadly my tamale was cold in the middle.  It had a green olive in it that was somewhat frozen....yuck.  The other items were good.  The third and final item was their South of the Border nachos....you could tell they had made this item first because the cheese was congealed so that when you went to lift a nacho, you could lift the entire plate.  Once we peeled off the \"shield of cheese\" the center was total mush, as it had been sitting there for a while.  the only chips that were crispy were the ones around the edges.  I was really sad that my family and I did not like the food because our area needs a really good mexican food place.  They do have really good salsa but their chips were store bought, as in I think it was a bag of tostidos rounds and tostidos regular chips mixed together.    So if you want terrible food with great customer service you can go to la casa de juana."}
{"text":"The decor made me feel like I was in Mexico. My family all tried different entries. Everyone, EVERYONE was amazed at how great the food was. The price was reasonable and the service was great   If people have eaton here and not likes the food, then they do not know authentic Mexican food.   The items served with the food were all fresh (per my wife) and the chips were light and crispy, not heavy with fried oil."}
{"text":"So so so bad. First experience here was not good. Second experience eclipsed it. The staff is out of their depth. Yikes."}
{"text":"NEVER RECIEVED ORDER BUT STILL GOT CHARGED. Trying to get refund but you know how that goes. Ordered off of yelp (eat24). The only reason I picked a star is because I had too. My actual rating is No Star."}
{"text":"Great place for traditional Mexican food and margaritas. Safe and clean place with great service. Fun for family or date night."}
{"text":"I love this place, great atmosphere, and Mexican food is bomb, but I always order the chicken wings..super crunchy"}
{"text":"This is my new spot!! The food is awesome not to salty seasoned just right!! Happy hour is the best time to come you get a bang for your buck!! I love the atmosphere it reminds me  of a place in Texas!! The girls and I really enjoyed eating here! I had the fish Verde the girls had shrimp fajitas and a breakfast burrito! Our waitress was the bomb made us feel welcomed I believe her name was clarissa.. I will check in here often!!!"}
{"text":"This place is as awesome as the one in Tempe!!!! YUMM!!! I also heard that they might be doing live music soon so I'll be definitely be coming back for that and some more $3 margaritas!!!  best food ever!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The happy hour is so great. And the environment is so comfortable. Very authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Do not go there... Went with a coworker, we were both sick for the rest of the day. I had the fish tacos which decided to swim up stream later in the day. Plush there was only one person acting as our waitress, hostess, server and I'm fairly certain she was the cook also."}
{"text":"Great little spot just popped in with my gentleman friend environment was very welcoming pleasantly sound music so far everything is definitely to our liking we will return!"}
{"text":"Can I just say, thank you Yelp for finding me this restaurant! It's hard to find a good hole in the wall restaurant sometimes, because well, it's tucked away! I ordered a margarita and burrito enchilada style and it was to die for. I am very sensitive to spicy foods, so I will say the least spicy sauce was still pushing my taste buds. It was nice to have sauces full of flavor for a change and not just bland. They really know how to season food and I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place, good food and margaritas, will go back again. Authentic and awesome.  The interior is different, very interesting. Each chair and booth has a nice traditional painting. Looks and feels great. The server was nice and made our special requests work."}
{"text":"New kid on the block and a winner for sure. Upon entering you'll be dazzled by the colorful d√©cor and the gracious service. This is a very affordable little spot right near a neighborhood bar, a great cupcake shop, and the $3 Cinema. We were wowed by the flavorful salsa put before us - not too spicy at all. And the chips kept coming.... Terrific icy margaritas (I'd get the rocks marg next time) and well-priced beverages. Every single thing we tried was delectable ... except the tamale. Why is that? No matter, everything else was delicious and we'll probably make this our neighborhood Mexican spot for dinner. Their brunch menu looked pretty tasty too. YUM."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this quaint little restaurant.  The waitress Hayatt is so accommodating  and such a great personality, food is super, everyone there greets you with a smile! A great taste of Mexico! For a nice casual restaurant, the visit is fun!"}
{"text":"Nice little place with good prices. The service is a little slow, but they keep you in chips and salsa, so it is all good. Definitely worth a try. I will probably come back when i go visit my sister again (she lives close by)."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The servers constantly try to rush you out of your seat due to not enough seating in the restaurant. Also  the queso dip is really greasy. Just for a heads up, the Mexican rice is not traditional Mexican rice, it's some sort of lime rice."}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  We've eaten here several times and the food is consistently delicious! The staff very friendly.  The restaurant is decorated very nicely.  Love the caramel filled churros."}
