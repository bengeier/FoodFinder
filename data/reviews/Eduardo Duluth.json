{"text":"Terrible don't go this place ! We were seated than waited 30 minute while being completely ignored by the wait staff. Let me add that it was not a busy night. Don't wastes your hard earned money at this excuse for an eatery!@"}
{"text":"Eduardo's was absolutely FANTASTIC!! We were in Montreal for a 4 day vacation and this was by far our favorite meal - we got to Eduardo's around 10PM on a Monday and there were only a few couples there. 

Our waitress was extremely friendly and the food was amazing - I highly highly recommend the spaghetti carbonara - it was better than anything I've ever had, considering both Europe and the US. 

There is no cork fee and it is BYOB - our final bill came to $33 with an appetizer and two entrees and our own bought bottle of wine. 

Cannot give enough praise to this little restaurant - we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"One of my favourite BYOB's in MTL. Service is pleasant and while it can get somewhat cramped, that adds to the Italian homeliness of the place. The Bruschetta here is excellent (some diced black olives add a nice salty twist) and comes on a bed of salad which makes for a fresh starter. I've had the Carbonara, Tortellini Rose, and Penne Arrabiata. Each is delicious, and like the olives in the Bruschetta, each has a little twist that works really well. For example, the Arrabiata sauce is made with banana pepper to give it a nice, sweet heat. Highly recommended, and with an SAQ right around the corner you can grab a couple bottles of wine on your way. I've always been too full to have dessert though, so I can't speak to that."}
{"text":"Great food at a good price and a nice relaxed ambience. Service isn't always perfect, but overall it's a great little dinner out."}
{"text":"For some reason, the tortellini was completely without flavour. This resto has long been a favourite of ours so we were stunned by the abject quality of what should be an effortless dish for an Italian restaurant. 

We went in March, and our last visit was two years before that...so maybe something's changed. Please don't make it difficult for us to recommend you, Eduardo!"}
{"text":"Food quality is average, I was expecting more from spaghetti bolognese I ordered. Staff is nice."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Montreal. I go here everytime I'm in the city. Really great value for yummy food.  Bring your wine makes it very affordable.  Cute ambiance with the exposed brick and stained glass windows. The servers are really nice.  Sometimes service can be slow, but go for a casual evening out and it wont be a problem.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, LOVE this place! When we first moved to Montreal, a co-worker showed us this restaurant and now we go at least once a month and always take our out-of-town visitors here. We have never had a bad experience at this cute little restaurant.

I highly recommend the Pesto Spaghetti and the Linguini Tuto Mare (seafood pasta with a rose sauce). The food is great and very reasonably priced AND you can bring your own wine. (there is an SAQ just across the street for easy access!)

Definitely check out this hidden gem next time you are in Montreal and don't forget to bring your wine!"}
{"text":"The place is really homey and the waitresses are friendly. The food is really good and cheap. The garlic bread is also good. Let's not forget that's it's a bring your own wine place and there's a SAQ around the corner, what do you want more?"}
{"text":"Si vous recherchez une restaurant italien authentique et abordable, sachez qu'Eduardo, situé au cur du plateau Mont-Royal, figure parmi les plus prisés. Son ambiance conviviale aux lumières tamisée et aux murs de bois, à la limite de la rusticité, est idéale tant pour les soupers en tête-à-tête que pour les soirées en famille. Le service est cordial et nullement pincé. N'y allez surtout pas sans votre bouteille de vin; même que la localisation du restaurant favorise les oublieux et les pressés: collé à une SAQ (Société des Alcools du Québec). Bien situé, c'est le moins qu'on puisse dire pour un «apportez votre vin»...

On y mange bien, et l'on ne lésine pas les portions généreuses. Table d'hôte ou pas, vous aurez le droit à du pain particulièrement bon pour accompagner votre repas. Pour ma part, j'avais pris une salade césar (avec la sauce traditionnelle, car elle contenait des anchois, et les anchois, je déteste ça!) et une gargantuesque lasagne qui aurait pu nourrir 3 personnes. Délicieuse et généreuse, mais interminable. Ma copine avait mangé des manicottis au fromage ricotta avec une entrée de fondue parmesan. Disons qu'elle ne s'attendait pas à une aussi grosse entrée...

Une grande variété de mets figure sur le menu : pâtes de toutes les sortes, fruits de mer (calamars frits, poissons, etc.), escalopes de veau, etc...

Un incontournable si vous avez envie de bonne pâtes pas trop chères et que vous errez dans les parages. On s'en tire pour environ 15$..."}
{"text":"Another trip to Montreal, another visit to Eduardo's, another 5 stars. The atmosphere in this restaurant is unbeatable.

Again, just love how they tailor their portion sizes based on how naturally filling the individual dishes are. Not enough restaurants do this."}
{"text":"Consistently good, well priced, cute interior. Friendly staff. Byob! Good date night spot."}
{"text":"My favourite Italian restaurant! I always get the seafood linguini, it's delicious and comes in huge portions with a generous amount of seafood for a very reasonable price, as is everything else on their menu. Bring your own wine is also a big bonus and there's a SAQ right across the street. 

I would highly recommend. Service can be slow sometimes (the most recent time I was there they had 1 waitress for the entire restaurant, and had to wait half an hour to even be acknowledged and well over an hour for our food), but other times have been fast."}
{"text":"The price was very reasonable for pasta and BYOB with no corkage is always great. However, I'm afraid they are cutting too many corners with the food. There is too much reliance on dried rather than fresh herbs. Obviously most restaurant ingredients are pre-prepared to a degree but the cannelloni seemed to be straight out of a packet. Pepper should always be ground (rather than shaken) in any self-respecting restaurant. And the parmesan is white dust rather than grated cheese. It would be better to have grated Canadian cheese rather than something masquerading as Italian cheese. Still, after a couple of glasses of wine it was cheap'n'cheerful!"}
{"text":"meh is the perfect way to express how I feel about this restaurant. I've been here a whole bunch of times because I had a friend who LOVED it here. Everytime I've gone, I've never been very impressed with their food. Very average Italian food. not very original, nor particularly delicious. Not somewhere I would suggest, especially since there are far superior places in the same neighborhood."}
{"text":"An excellent BYO option! Very reasonably priced, delicious pasta and the service was great as well. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is always crowded and full-house because space is limited. Extremely noisy,  dim, and poorly ventilated. We went to this place just because the other Italian restaurant, also BYOW, did not take reservation on weekends and required an hour of waiting when it was already 8:45pm.  
Food was ok, nothing extraordinary. After trying some entrees, pasta main course, and scalloppini, we know that next time we will skip the garlic bread gratiné and parma ham with honeydew wedges."}
{"text":"Good food and good times. I'd give it 4 stars, but I just can't, due to my Italian heritage and knowing exactly what good Italian food should taste like.  But its good for restaurant Italian, cheap and plentiful, and bring your own wine to boot. The decor itself does remind me of my (Italian) grandparents: their basement was similarly decorated, complete with stucco and brick arches. It was pretty awesome, and Eduardo's is too. I wouldn't suggest bringing a first date here, unless you have a thing for cramped bring your own wine restos, but this is the perfect place to go for a girls night out.  I've been here several times with a good friend of mine, when we feel like eating well, sharing a bottle of wine, and chatting the night away."}
{"text":"I've been to Edwardo's twice now, and its definitely a good meal for a good price. I'd say the worst thing on the menu is the fettuccine alfredo (kind of try and pasty), but everything else is really, really good. 

The second time I had the Surf and Turf: a filet mignon, shrimp and pasta for $24.00. That meal anywhere else would have been over $30.

Great place to go with friends and a bottle of wine, in my opinion WAY better then going to the factory that is l'Academie across the street."}
{"text":"I wish I could take all of the unused stars from previous reviews and give them to Eduardo's. 

Eduardo's entire staff made my visit to Montreal just that much cooler. I stumbled upon this little hole in the wall on a bustling Saturday night. I was curious and hungry. I stood in line with everyone else for about 45 minutes before finally being seated at a quaint little table for one. 

The staff could have been less attentive, they could have made me feel rushed, they could have been frustrated at my incredibly limited - non existent - French. They could have done all of those things and it would have been expected, since, afterall I was just a solo American diner on a budget. But instead, everyone at Eduardo's treated me like royalty. From the hostess that sat me down to the waitress that came around and refilled my water glass at every opportunity. She was so incredibly patient while I asked a thousand questions and finally decided on a dish and then quickly backslid and changed my order. 

All in all, the food was great, the service was beyond spectacular, and the atmosphere was just what I wanted: Fun, french, and memorable."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Eduardo's late on a Sunday night when everything else on St. Denis was closed. They were closed, too, but Elisabeth the server took pity on us and seated us. This was a harbinger of our good fortune, as the food is superb. The vibe is cosy and sweet throughout. BYOW and there is a SAQ across the street on St. Denis. We will be back."}
{"text":"Came back for the Linguine Tuto Mare and WOOOOO it was delish!!!"}
{"text":"(Ben writing in Keewi's account)  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't much good.  The server was friendly, but very distracted chatting with her friends, so it was hard to catch her eye.  The bread was a bit burned, enough to be black in spots and taste like carbon.  The linguini alla vongole came in an alfredo sauce, of all things, not the white wine sauce it's supposed to have.  The clams were canned, and gritty with sand.  The pasta was overcooked, not al dente.  The soup was oversalted.  The fried calamari's breading was soft and chewy and oily, not crisp.  The mussels appetizer was the best part of the meal, and it was just OK, not divine.  The prices are low, so if that's all that matters to you, then there you are.  And there may be better things on the menu that we didn't try.  But we will not be going back to find out."}
{"text":"Une étoile pour le seul point positif et je suis généreux. 

Tout d'abord, le positif. C'est tellement peu que ça sera vite fait. La nourriture est délicieuse et très abordable. De plus, puisque c'est un restaurant apportez votre vin, la facture est très basse. 

Maintenant, tous les problèmes. Premièrement le local est ridiculement petit mais les propriétaires ont décidé de rentabiliser l'espace en ne laissant aucun espace pour circuler. On voit et entend son voisin trois tables plus loin saper sur ses pâtes. Lorsqu'un client entre ou sort, la moitié du restaurant doit se lever pour faire de la place. 

Deuxièmement, il est impossible de réserver une table ou de s'assoir sans que le groupe ne soit complet. Nous étions 5 d'un groupe de 6 à attendre alors que le sixième cherchait un stationnement et on a refusé de nous laisser aller nous assoir pour boire ou manger un petit pain en attendant. 

Troisièmement, le service est vraiment exécrable. Étant donnée la promiscuité forcée de l'endroit, les serveurs ont toutes les misères du monde à circuler et ne viennent donc pas remplir les verres d'eau, s'enquérir de s'il manque quelque chose ou même libérer la table lorsque les plats sont terminés. 

Quatrièmement, le service est d'une lenteur incroyable. Comme le personnel ne passe pas voir leurs clients, il faut attendre longtemps pour passer la commande et encore plus pour recevoir les repas. Ensuite, préparez votre patience pour l'attente de la facture... Aussi bien aller chercher un membre du personnel soi-même. C'est encore plus incroyable lorsque l'on voit la file d'attente des clients qui veulent une table et qui se rend jusque sur le trottoir. 

Négativisme bonus pour l'absence de possibilité de payer par Interac alors que la machine est présente et que les cartes de crédit sont acceptées. 

Finalement, pour faire suite au service exécrable, les membres du personnel m'ont poussé et accroché durant tout le repas sans qu'aucun d'entre eux ne s'excuse. J'ai vu que je n'étais pas le seul client qui subissait ce traitement."}
{"text":"Stumble to this small little Italian restaurant on a Thursday afternoon. Very cozy atmosphere with good Italian food. The menu is in Italian and the waitress speak
Mainly French. Trying to order your dinner with the menu in Italian only can be difficult. Thanx to Apple phone we manage to order our dinner. The spaghetti sauce was excellent. If you are in the mood for some Italian in Montreal, stop by."}
{"text":"One of the things I love about Eduardo's is the fact that it's very lively, people love it because it's a good BYOW and cheap eat.

I discovered this place about 2 years ago and I've been a fan ever since. My go to meal is the veal milanese with the yummy lemon sauce on top. You have a choice of vegetables or pasta I always take the creamy white pasta it's delicious and goes really good together. Bruschetta is really good as well sometimes it's on a toasty croutons but mostly it's served on 4 fresh slices of bread. Under neath is the best part they lay it on top of a creamy oily salad. YUM!

I've always had my food arrive on time and friendly staff and never had a bad meal here. For those who are skeptical about going and don't know what to get I would suggest my meal or a simple pasta and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I don't normally choose Italian, but my friend wanted a nice meal with a bottle of wine and the options outside French bistro type food are limited in this area.  The void was very good and the service even better.  I had the veal scallopini with mixed vegetables and linguini and my friend had the tortellini in red cream sauce.  You can't beat the prices!  Dinner for two tax and tip was 50$!"}
{"text":"I just LOVE Eduardo's!! It is a very popular bring your own wine restaurant in Montreal. It has been around for about 20 years. Come early or later as you will have to wait in line. 
The menu is Italian. I love that you can chose your pasta sauce: Rose, Alfredo, or classic tomato. The bread is also delicious.
Located up on the Plateau, on the corner of St. Denis. 
Bring your wine."}
{"text":"Good BYOW Italian, and well-priced compared to the competitors across the street! The restaurant had a nice homey feel inside but was a bit tight on space. My friend and I split the mussels as an appetizer. They were well cooked and the marinara sauce was very fresh! I enjoyed the veal parmesan with fettucine alfredo as my main. It was a large portion, but I was starving and ate it all! I love fettucine afredo, but my friend wished she could have substituted for another pasta. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic food, for a reasonable price.    A good option for sure."}
{"text":"One of the most reasonably priced Italian restaurants I've been to in Montreal. Eduardo's serves unapologetic, hearty, and hefty Italian cuisine at extremely reasonable prices. I LOVE this place, not so much for the food, but for the great times I've had with my friends coming here over the past few years. The fact that you can bring your own wine, which they will cork for free for your table, makes this place a drunken, feel great, good eats kind of place with very friendly service - and there's this invitingly cozy charm here that can't be explained unless you've eaten here..seriously!

My friends and I recently ate here and had one hell of great meal: cold antipasti salad to start (awesome-see pics) $8.95C, Lasagna $9.95C (huge portion and delicious), and Veal Picatta served with a side of Fettuccini Alfredo $12.95C (very good quality and value). We were pleasantly stuffed while we sat and watched the blizzard outside as we leisurely downed 2 bottles of wine...good times! Although, I didn't have it this visit, Eduardo's makes one of the best minestrone soups that I highly recommend - and at $4.95C you get huge bowl of it!

Look, you're not going to find any award wining dishes here, but Eduardo's is not about that. Eduardo's, for me, is about the unreplicated experience it provides, that you must check out for yourself. For that, Eduardo's gets 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Really just an OK experience, nothing spectacular as far as the food goes. 
I went there with my parents and my partner. She is vegetarian, and an Italian restaurant usually has many options for her - and they did not disappoint in this department. The place was packed and the one waitress was very efficient, however although she did her best, it took some time to get to taking our orders, and overall service was just OK. I started with their antipasti Eduardo appetiser - a fantastic choice of salad, with olives, pickled mushrooms, choice of sausages, a piece of hard cheese, melon and prosciutto, artichoke and probably something else I'm leaving out :). This was great. My mom got the Cesar salad and said it wasn't great - she didn't like the dried bacon bits and the sauce wasn't the best she has had. My dad got the eggplant starter and was happy with it though he thought that it could use more pepper. For my main dish I got the spaghetti carbonara which was just ok - again these bacon dried bits that my mom disliked in her salad reappeared in my spaghetti. I didn't feel an egg yolk in there either. My dad was pleased with his surf n'turf dish, but complained that not all the prowns were peeled (just one was). My partner had the pasta primavera and my mom had the cheese tortellini  with cream sauce, and both were happy with their dishes. We were too stuffed for dessert. The bill came to 110$ including tax and tip (we brought our own wine), which isn't too bad for such a meal."}
{"text":"Food was very well priced and hearty. I really enjoyed the complimentary bread that was provided - it was rosemary flavored and served nice and warm, which is something I appreciate (I hate cold bread). The calamari was a bit on the dry side but still good. The pasta I ordered (linguini with clams and tomato sauce) was flavorful and I enjoyed it.

We were able to bring our own wine and was not charged a corkage fee. This must be a big selling point for this restaurant as every table in there had at least two bottles of self-brought wine!

Don't come here expecting a super fancy dinner because that's not the point here. It's a small, cozy Italian restaurant with hearty dishes at very very moderate prices. Service is very friendly and people come here to chat over bottles after bottles of wine."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré ce restaurant! 
Nous y sommes allés un samedi soir, l'endroit était plein, nous n'avions pas réservé chose qu'on fera la prochaine fois car nous avons patienté pendant 1h mais ça valait le coup. J'ai pris des spaghetti au pesto, un délice! Le service est rapide, les portions généreuses et les prix sont abordables et on peut apporter son vin. 
Je recommande vivement ce restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Went here based on Matthew A's review. The man knows what he's talking about. 

We had the brushetta as an appetizer. While not the best brushetta in the world (merely just chopped tomato and a little basil on the bread, no cheese), it still had enough flavor to satisfy one's mouth. It was also nice that they had a little salad in the middle of the plate, so basically you're getting two dishes for the price of one (at a bargain rate of $6.95). 

My main dish was the meat tortellini in the rose sauce, and my friend got the fettuccine Alfredo. The pasta seemed very fresh. Both sauces were creamy, but not overly so. The rose sauce was flavorful, but the alfredo was a little on the bland side. No complaints though since each was a little under 10 dollars.

Lastly, the server was very attentive and the hostess was H-O-T. The latter is irrelevant for the most part but hey, if you need eye candy during your meal, this place ain't so bad on a a Friday night. 

And matthew is right, this place is BUSY. We got there just in time (around 8:15). There was a substantial # of people waiting by the time we left 45 minutes later."}
{"text":"I came here late, after giving an artist talk at the nearby Studio XX, on the recommendation of a friend. She was raving about this super cheap eggplant appetizer that was the size of a meal, plus it's BYOB and there's a dep and an SAQ just nearby. So, I was sold. I checked the Yelp rating and it wasn't that good, so I wasn't expecting anything exceptional, but I WAS hungry and it was close, so I was game.

It's been a while since I've hung out on Duluth, and typically you'll find a wide variety of ethnic restaurants from high end to lunch special, but most are closed later on in the evening. We arrived at Eduardo Duluth (an Italian restaurant with a pub-like vibe) around 10pm, and hallelujah, the kitchen was still open! First plus. 

The staff were super accommodating, and immediately pulled together a bunch of tables for our party of 7. Our server was really good, corking our wine before I even knew what was happening, and getting our orders in toute de suite. I went with my friend's advice and tried the eggplant parmesan thing, split with my date, along with two orders of garlic bread au gratinée, and it was definitely delicious and definitely enough for both of us, to sate our late evening appetites. By the way, the eggplant appetizer is only $6.

The menu was substantial, so I encouraged one of my friends to get the fried calamari, which I was interested in eating half of as well. haha! It was great, so maybe I'll admit that I ate more than half of his order! He was busy flirting so I doubt he noticed anyway. ;)

I'd come back in a heartbeat. I think we were the loudest table in the place, especially after we got into the second bottle of wine, but the staff were gracious. Being from the maritimes, I love that cozy, homey pub feel and this place has it going on. If you find yourself wandering around Duluth late in the evening and need a pit stop to warm up and refuel, this is the place. Just hop into the dep on the corner and you're set."}
{"text":"The pasta at this place is right for its price. I forget the exact name of the dish I ordered, but it was a spicy red sauce penne pasta on their regular menu. It definitely had a kick and it could use more vegetables, but I was more concerned with carbo-loading at the time.

For a bring your own wine restaurant and food available at their more-than-reasonable prices, I'd come back."}
{"text":"Located on St Dennis & Duluth, Eduardo's is famous for their pasta's without being too heavy on your wallet. Also its BYOW. Service is ok. They make you wait till all the people in your group arrive. It seems to be very popular as there's a lineup. I had their Calamari. Its pretty good for the price. Their pasta sauces are good too. 
Let me be honest, The food here is not really great (though not bad either) but you get what you pay for.

All in all it's just another brick in the wall

Food -  Good 
Service - Friendly  
Ambiance - Casual
Worth the money - Yes"}
{"text":"The service was really bad, food was  good, service was really bad, bathroom was clean, service was really bad, we saw a tiramisu cake looked good, however service was reaaaaaallly bad"}
{"text":"We stopped in Friday night around 8pm and there was a line with a 30 minute wait. Both Eduardo's and the place across the road had similar reviews, but Eduardo's felt cozy as though you were going to Grandma's place for dinner! (As opposed to a night club...and less expensive.) We were the only people in line without a bottle of wine! Next time we'll get it right. 

The wait ended up being about half the suggested time, so that was nice. We ordered a salad to share and carbonara. The carbonara was really, really tasty. The salad was nice, too. It came with a delicious bread to start. (Apparently I am writing this review in reverse-chronological order.) 

Overall seems like a wonderful place! I docked it a star because it was really loud (and I don't usually mind loud places), and it seemed like there were enough servers to keep up with the crowd. For the food, décor, and friendly service, though, it would earn 5 stars."}
{"text":"Ah, my first 1 star review. I cannot speak to the food at Eduardo's because I was turned away at the door.

During our vacation to Montreal, my girlfriend and I bought a nice bottle of wine and headed over to this BYOB Italian spot. We took a cab accross town which was pricey, but which we did not mind because we thought this place would be worth it.

The restaurant was scheduled to close at 11pm and I believe we arrived at 10pm on the dot. As we entered, a woman approached us and told us that they had decided to close for the night (even though there were visibly customers inside). I explained that we were on vacation and that we'd come all the way across town and she just said \"sorry\" in a way that meant she wasn't sorry at all.

I wanted to salvage the night so I asked if she could recommend a BYOB place nearby, as we had brought our wine and already come to this neighborhood. She thought for a second and then said \"it's tough\" and showed us the door.

I gave them a chance to feed us. I gave them a chance to be helpful or at least polite. They weren't interested. 1 star."}
{"text":"We used to go here all the time as a gang of ravenous undergraduates because BYO and a huge inexpensive mound of pasta within walking distance of your tiny crowded apartment just makes sense at that age. I hadn't been back in a while but Matt and Cindy's recent UYE (unofficial yelp event) brought me back and made me realize that inexpensive mounds of good food at a BYO never stops being a good idea, and is especially wise on Mondays. 

I ordered the Surf and Turf because at $24 this has to be one of the cheapest quality deals for steak, shrimp and pasta in town. The pasta was fresh and the sauce pure cream and butter goodness. The shrimp were really good, not fishy at all, and the steak was kind of amazing, super tender, juicy and perfectly medium rare in a light wine gravy.

All in all a very satisfying yummy meal made better by the vines and stained glass and the exceptionally adorable company."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Location: 4/5

Eduardo Duluth is a cute little Italian restaurant located near the bustling student areas of Montreal. It is a small and slightly cramped place, but it adds to it's hole-in-the-wall charm. The dim lighting and the sprawling ivy décor make for a very European feel. The wait staff were friendly and helpful, even though it was a very hectic Saturday night.  Be aware that they didn't take reservations and they will ONLY seat you when every member of your party is there. 

I was intrigued by the restaurant's BYOB concept, which I've heard is common in Montreal but I have not really come across in Toronto. With an SAQ right across the street, it felt great to know we could bring our own cheap wine to pair with dinner without spending an arm and a leg paying a premium per glass. Bottom line BYOB is a blessing for a fun, boozy dinner and a great night. 

Despite the ambiance and abundantly flowing booze, the food didn't really blow me away. I ordered the meat tortellini with rose sauce and I found it just average. The flavours felt like something I could recreate from a jar. But for the price, I definitely can't complain. The huge portion of tortellini was only $12 and I'm never one to complain when somebody sets down a massive plate of cheesy carbs in front of me. 

Overall I would recommend coming here if you're just looking for an affordable and lively night (DON'T FORGET TO BRING THE WINE). Just don't expect their pasta to be anything fancy."}
{"text":"I like this place although there are some serious downsides. 
The pros:
-the pasta is great
-the byob aspect is amazing because the restaurant bill is considerably lower than a regular restaurant 
-the place is very cozy, has an old world feel
-the desserts are amazing! The tiramisu looks very basic but it's THE BEST tiramisu I've ever had and the ice cream profiteroles are amazing. 

The cons:
-the service was shitty. The waitress barely understood my friend who speaks only English. He asked about meat balls and she had no clue what he meant. She forgot to bring our soups. She was rude. Despite the shitty service, I would still go back. But he warned of the waitress with the tattoos, expect crappy service. 
-also the place has a bit of a humidity old basement smell to it but it's super old and the building is ancient so it's forgivable."}
{"text":"Les pâtes que je me fais chez moi sont plus savoureuse. Le pain à l'ail était détrampé dans le beurre. Les pâtes du fast food La Popessa sont meilleures."}
{"text":"Homestyle Italian comfort restaurant set amongst the densely populated BYOW restaurants on Duluth street. 
BYOW restaurants usually fall a bit short on the food side for me, but not this place.

They start you off with some homemade herb spiced warm bread that just warms the soul and opens the appetite.

The menu consists mainly of pasta and veal dishes.
My partner had the seafood linguini in rose sauce. So much seafood, it was almost at a 1:1 ratio with the pasta! 
I had the lamb shank special of the day. It was a simply delicious portion of braised lamb seasoned with rosemary and orange peel.
Super generous portions, one main is definitely enough. 
You won't find very innovative flavours or creative dishes here, but if you're in the mood for some good classic Italian, this place is definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for ages, since trying Lombardi's across the street a while back and enjoying it. Last night, got two bottles of red wine from the SAQ across the street, and came here with wifey.

It was nice. A wide selection of pastas, big portions, and reasonable prices. We had a cannelloni, pink sauced vegetarian pasta, mixed starter, and a salad. Everything was nice (although cannelloni didn't seem 100% fresh/heated properly). It costs $44 in total before tip. We had a nice 1.5hrs. But all in all I wasn't completely sold as a great experience. Just little things, here and there, hence the 3 stars, not 4.

The following are some critiques based on the assumption that this place is a lovely BYOW Italian place in a great part of town:

Our server started off really nice, but became much less so by the time the bill arrived/as the place got more packed, which created a natural feeling of decline. Also, the place is quite crammed, packed back to back, with the tables themselves (2 seaters) being very very small. Anytime I'd back up my chair I'd hit the person behind me, and there was no space on the tables for anything like elbows or additional salad plate or wtv (we put most things on the floor/table next to us like wine/pepper etc). Also, when we asked for olive oil, we were told there was none. And lastly, when we ordered a mixed starter and a salad, 3/4 of the mixed starter WAS a salad, it would've been nice to have been informed of that when ordered, particularly when there's no mention of salads in the starter section, leading one to believe the mixed starter is a mixture of starters only.

These little things here and there just took away from the evening, particularly because they seem like easily fixable/obvious things. Also, people argue that this place is cheap, but for a BYOW place, it is average to above average. If it was in fact cheap, like the awesome $30 (after tip for two) BYOW hungarian or many others down the road, these things would be totally ignored, but the extra $14 + tip left a feeling of \"hmmm..\"

We went to Lombardi's across the street before, and they had the same arrangement, but tiny tweaks that made it more customer friendly.

But all in all a lovely place, and I probably would return, just the experience overall left something to be desired."}
{"text":"The Bolognese tasted like Spaghettios. Cute environment, but the mediocre food doesn't make it a place you'd want to go."}

{"text":"My first time here was for the inaugural Montreal BYOW Monday (MBYOWM going forward), and it was a great choice, and a great way to start what has now become A Big Deal in Montreal Yelp-land.

This place is a big player in the \"cheap and cheerful\" category. The mains are all reasonably priced, and come out in large servings. 

It's not all quantity either - this place has been around for a long time, and they know what they're doing. Don't be worried if you can't finish your meal, ask to take it home with you - it tastes even better then next day.

The place is nice, but not too fancy. The plastic vines on the ceiling just scream \"I'MMA ITALIAN RESTAURANTE!!!\". I probably wouldn't bring someone here to impress them, but for a good solid meal (reasonably priced) with good friends, or fixing an Italian craving, there's nothing better.

As mentioned this place is BYOW, so grab a bottle to make your meal even more cheap and more cheerful (there's a few deps around, but I didn't see a SAQ, so get a wine before you get there)."}
{"text":"Not sure what I can say that hasn't been said already...

But this is a great place to get together with some friends for some great cheap food and all the wine you can bring.  This place has a really nice friendly and casual yet busy and lively atmosphere that is just right."}
{"text":"It's one of those restaurants that makes you feel all warm and cosy as soon as you step in inside. I love BYOB restaurants where you bring a bottle of your favorite wine and ready to enjoy a nice evening with friends or family. The service is great and their menu includes various meat, seafood and pasta dishes. It's also budget friendly, and could be a good place for a moderately-priced date evening."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying the food at Eduardo's is a very solid four stars maybe slightly higher, so why the three, unfortunately the service was 2.0 stars and sporadic. My waitress was new at waitressing which normally wouldn't be a problem for me. Both she another waitress, however; were in wrapped conversation the entire time I was there to the inclusion of keeping an eye on their tables. The table behind me tried to catch her eye for a solid 10 minutes before finally securing her attention and receiving their check. There were only five tables that evening so there was no excuse for the general lack of oversight and customer service.
This was my second time dining there and as I previously stated the food is very very good. The salad and dressing was superb and my Osso Bucco Milanese with fresh made fettuccine was phenomenal very tender, juicy and flavorful. I would have considered dessert but the experience was considerably dulled buy poor service and the thought of any further delay. 
I still would return in the future because Eduardo does an extremely good job and has more than demonstrated his prowess in the kitchen. I met him the first time I was there and when I return if things have not changed in the front of the house, I will ask to meet him once again!"}
{"text":"Not the Eduardo's on Laurier street...

My better half and I used to go to the Eduardo's on Laurier. We were regulars there. Good food, good prices, very good service. And then, a couple of years ago, it closed...very sad.

Now, we thought \"hey, after all these years, let's go try the one on Duluth...\" 

The food is pretty much the same. Same recipes. Not high end Italian food, but good food. Good prices.
Now, as for the place...I felt like I was in a \"overcrowded noisy old cafeteria\".  The place is tight. Really tight. I got bumped a few times by the servers walking thru the isle. Uncomfortable chairs. Tiny tables.

As for the service, it was below average. It felt like they were doing us a favor. As if we were bothering them a little.

Now, for me, when I go to a restaurant, it's not only about the food. It's a complete experience. The place, the ambiance, customer service etc.. By all means, I don't need anybody to kiss my ***, and I don't need to feel like I'm eating in San Gimignano,  but the minimum is to feel like someone who is being taken care off. Because if I only rely on the food, as good as it was, I can do Italian better in my own home...trust me. 

So, why would I go back?"}
{"text":"Un BYO italien avec des pâtes fraîches, en bas de 10$ et des portions tellement généreuses que pour une personne comme moi, ça donne 3 repas. Qui pourrait dire non à ça? J'y suis allée avec un groupe de Yelpeurs pour les tous nouveaux \"BYO Mondays\" et j'ai été bien contente de découvrir Eduardo's. On a ris comme des fous et puisqu'on était seuls dans la salle à la droite pendant un bout, au moins on ne se sentait pas trop mal d'être un peu bruyant! N'ayant pas étudié à Montréal comme les autres assis à table, c'était ma première expérience et ça bien répondu à mes attentes, même peut-être un peu plus. Avec la SAQ à deux pas de là, même si vous vous y rendez en oubliant d'apportez votre propre bouteille de vin, en moins de 5 minutes vous pourrez régler le problème. Bon endroit pour souper entre amis et peut-être même en amoureux pour une soirée bien relaxe."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a lonnnng time but walking in felt like a time warp: a good time warp for a change! Came here last night for a heap of cheap & tasty cheese tortellini that I chased down with my own bottle of NZ pinot noir: god bless BYO joints in our fair city. The awesomeness that is Eduardo's was only made better by my Yelp besties for a Monday night UYE dinner, new tradition? I definitely think so :)

This place isn't anything fancy but it's cheap, cheerful and does the trick. Plus it appears that unless you are a ravenous Australian, you will definitely have enough for leftovers to take home for lunch the next day: nom nom."}
{"text":"I really don't know why this place has such good reviews. Granted, it is byob and CHEAP but what a waste of money anyways! Our pastas were so over cooked that it was starting to become like a paste and my lamb was dry, very fatty at the same time. The bread was dry and stale. The parmesan that was on the table was the \"fake\" one. You know, the like the Kraft one in a green shaker. My husband's sauce had banana bell peppers in it. It was weird. I barely touched anything and basically got drunk on a 25$ bottle. Are you asking yourself why I had a 25$ bottle of wine?? Well, it's because the couple we went with said that this place was SUPER GOOD! I regret it. But at least my wine was delicious lol! The extra star is for the waitress. She was really sweet!"}
{"text":"Decent meal and reasonable price for a byob. It's always busy so chances are there will be a line up.Every pasta dish I've had in the past was decent."}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of the owner of the B&B - very good recommendation.  The food here is very good - outstanding if you consider how reasonably priced it is.  

We went on a Tuesday evening when it wasn't too crowded.  Like many restaurants in Montreal - the restaurant was opened-up to the street which is great on a warm summer evening.  Also, it was great to be somewhere where not everyone was speaking English and not everyone was a tourist.  Finally, it is BYOB (W) with no corkage charge and the SAQ is just across the street. 

The bruschetta was very tasty - my camberelli creole had a nice kick to it.  The service was very good.  The waitress answered all of our questions and w"}
