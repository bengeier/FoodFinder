{"text":"Not your typical Hookah/Cigar Lounge, A++ Service, excellent environment for friends and family to gather and enjoy authentic middle eastern hookahs and premium cigars. Cozy leather couches with the 50 inch flat screens give you that at home living room feeling along with the first class customer service...I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for the best Hookah in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"One of the best hookahs around. The staff is super nice. You always get a new hoes so no germs will be spread. And give you a few coals with your hookah. They also give you a choice of what kind of head you want and what kind of colas you want to use."}
{"text":"Great place to hang and relax. If your a fan of good hookah they have a nice variety of flavors to choose from. They also have decent cafe items; sandwiches, smoothies, lattes etc.

Service is excellent and the owners are usually there themselves making sure the place is ran smoothly."}
{"text":"The Legacy Cafe and Lounge was one of the best, most cozy hookah bars I have been to. The first day I came with some friends and got seated immediately and was greeted by a wonderful waitress, whom explained to us the menu and more options that were not listed.

  In addition to hookah this lounge also offers a variety of food and hand made drinks. Both which I ordered and was extremely surprised! Most lounges have some cold stored food but this lounge made it all fresh.  I would highly recommend the cafe diablo. 

  Now to the hookah, we got two different ones, a blackberry peach and mint one along with a strawberry lemon one. Both were great and done traditional style. You are given a brand new house along with a full set of coals to light yourself. 

In total this was a great experience, with friendly staff and excellent food and hookah this place is a must stop when coming to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Not your average hookah lounge. Great hookahs, food, and milkshakes. I personally like the strawberry banana. Great atmosphere. Love all the tvs so no matter where you sit you can watch something."}
{"text":"Great place and great atmosphere with even an orange head :) but a whole entire hour for a wing basket and after telling the waitress twice we still never got 2 water bottles,  a soda and had to pay for it. Besides the service, the hookah itself was good !"}
{"text":"Easily the best, most comfortable hookah place I've been to in awhile. The hookah is good, the service is better. Not to mention the Arab sweets and smoothies were amazing! I highly recommend you check it out if you're looking for a chill time."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and amazing hookah. You walk in and it's an immediate sense of fun and friendship. They will serve you freshly made hookahs with all sorts of flavors and different brands to satisfy even the snobbish hookah smokers. Great variety of cigars and professionally made coffee and espresso. I love this place. 

AMAZING PLACE!"}
