{"text":"Lots of sushi choices and it's inside the Fort Mcdowell casino. Free soda if you get a server walking around with them by the slot machines so that's a plus. Only bad thing about this spot is they don't sell sweet potato rolls and thats the only type of rolls I like but my girlfriend loves this place so hence the 5 stars. Note to the manager of the location please start selling sweet potato rolls!!! I will be your most frequent customer if you start selling them. I like how they make the rolls fresh right when you order them and I also dig how they have three tv's playing in front of you while you eat. The movie Taken 2 was playing when we were visiting. I like how they have the definition of every type of roll they have on a slip. I have never seen the rolls broken down that easily before."}
{"text":"I spent 3 days at the We Ko Pa Hotel, which is adjacent to the Ft. McDowell Casino. I ate at Noodles Sushiya every day I was there. Whether it was the fried rice, pad thai or sushi, everything was really good. The lemongrass beef that a friend had was delivious with great flavor. 

Prices were affordable. 

The casino wasn't overly busy, so there were not any long waits. The food came out hot and fresh. 

The staff was friendly. 

There is not a lot out that way, but i would drive out there just to eat there."}
{"text":"This sushi is surprisingly good.  Cant belive it is at a casino.  Have eaten here many times and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place while I've been here and tonight I felt like Japanese food. They have sushi and traditional noodle or rice bowls. Initially I ordered a few rolls and was disappointed when I found out the sushi chefs were nowhere to be found. I changed my order and got the lemongrass beef (which was the waitress's recommendation). My meal was very tasty- Not quite outstanding, but better than I expected. I'll be trying the hand rolls next time for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I love the beef chow fun and hubby and daughter love the dragon roll. The sodas are free, the service is great, but if you're a non smoker you may want to take your food to go."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this sushi bar instead of the buffet. This restaurant is located at the south part of the casino near the exits to the Radisson Hotel.

Didn't have any problem with the cigarette smoke as this area is removed from the main gambling area. Instead of sitting at the bar, which has tall chairs, we sat at these small round tables which can handle only two people instead of the four chairs that are at each table.

It took us awhile to have someone wait on us 'cause there was an employee cleaning and setting the tables. I had to ask him if we had to order at the bar first and he said that someone will take our order. The server came by and we gave her our order of Lucky and spider roll along with House Special Noodles and Tempura.
 
Both of us had the beer on tap, a plastic cup of beer is $2. Our server brought my noodle dish out first and my wife had to wait five minutes for her tempura. In between that, we received our sushi orders.

The House Special Noodles was great, it had 5-6 shrimp, BBQ pork, beef, chicken, bok choy, mushrooms, carrots and lots of onions. Where's the NOODLES?? The noodles in my plate were lacking in quantity but the flavors were all there. As for the tempura, it wasn't crunchy and vegetables were undercooked, even the shrimp felt like it needed a minute or two more. When you dipped the tempura in the sauce, you had to quickly eat it before it fell apart.

The sushi was excellent. The Lucky 7 sushi had shrimp, avocado and spicy tuna. It was excellent, fresh and without the fancy sauces other restaurants use. The Spider roll was excellent but could have been sliced a little thinner.

As for the price, it's about the same as if you went to a Japanese restaurant. I will be back for the sushi and bypass all the other stuff."}
{"text":"I think this place hasn't been reviewed in awhile because the guests are still recovering from food poisoning. The first time my girlfriend and I ate here was over a year ago. She was up all night vomiting afterwards.  Since it had been a long time, and there are not many options at the Fort McDowell, we tried it again last night.  Girlfriend got sick again!  I couldn't even finish the sushi roll I ordered as it tasted very fishy (read old). You could tell by the dull color of the fish that something wasn't right.  They ironically have cameras mounted on the ceiling to display the sushi chef's work. While watching, you can see them wiping down their work area with the same dirty rag. The second visit was my fault as I should have learned my lesson the first time, but others and the management need to know."}
{"text":"The women in charge of that noodle place 
 kicked my visually disabled girlfriend and I out of the casino. We have stayed there over 10 times and we will never be back."}
{"text":"A little sushi bar in the middle of the casino.  They also have a couple of tables next to the bar.  I kept it simple and ordered the veggie chow mein.  Decent set of veggies, the sauce was flavorful and the price good. 

Tried their crab roll with eel sauce, was just ok, same with a simple cucumber roll.  

Service was good and they've got green iced tea.

No complaints."}
