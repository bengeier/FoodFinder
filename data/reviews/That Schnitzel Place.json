{"text":"Went to That Schnitzel Place for a family meal and it was wonderful. The gourmet toppings are the highlight of the sandwich and there is so much to choose from!   I did however find the meat portion to be rather \"thin\" and I know it's a Schnitzel and the meat has been pounded to be thin - but I was hard pressed to find the chicken in my sandwich.   It did not stop me from finishing the whole thing mind you! But if you're a real meat lover, you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"A group of us went here for the first time today and we were all impressed!  That Schnitzel Place has a great selection of schnitzelly good sandwiches. The sandwiches are all priced the same and you choose the type of meat (or portobello mushroom for veggie loving folks) and then select a topping \"theme\". Each topping theme has a combination of fresh veggies and sauces which are paired perfectly. Portions are good. I think we tried just about every sandwich type and everyone had great things to say about their choice. The schnitzel itself was beautifully fresh and crispy-and not greasy at all which was nice.  They also have soup and other sides like potato salad. The soup comes in a meal size or a perfectly portioned side size-a great addition to the sandwich.  The counter staff were friendly and prompt. One of our party members had a small mistake with her sandwich. Not only were they quick to fix it, they also came by later with a voucher for her next meal. Great to see good customer service.  I will definitely be going back there!"}
{"text":"Great schnitzel sandwiches and soup. Very filling. Highly recommended. Could be pricey for some. Your sandwich is made to order, so don't expect your schnitzel to be ready a minute after you order."}
{"text":"Claimed our 4 FREE Schnitzel sandwiches before the offer ends soon.  We got our free sandwich offer just by signing up for special offers at their website http://www.that-schnitzel-place.com/ .  It is a great marketing tool!  Thanks, That Schnitzel Place!  We had the Olga's Original, Silk Road, Parthenon and La Dolce Vita.  Of course, we had to try each other's sandwiches!  I like Parthenon the best 'cos of the goat cheese.  I am partial to goat cheese!   The description of the Parthenon is:   Fresh parsley lemon caper pesto; goat cheese; caramelized red onions; saut√©ed red and green peppers; fresh arugula.  I had my Parthenon with a chicken schnitzel.  Not too keen on Silk Road as it's on the sweet side.  The La Dolce Vita is not too bad.  I have yet to try Olga's Original as I got too full.  Will update later.  These sandwiches are a fair size but they aren't as big as the original Vienna Lux's sandwiches.  I liked the schnitzel at Vienna Lux better than this place but the difference is that That Schnitzel Place has interesting blending of flavours, vegetables and meat.    We also tried a cup of barley & beef soup and it was quite good.  The side salad and their very tasty house-made salad dressing.    Parking could be a problem as there is only street parking.  Restaurant is only open on Mon to Fri from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.  They are not open on weekends.  I hope they will eventually.  I'd come back again!"}
