{"text":"This used to be the best gyro in town, and that includes the Danforth.  The portions were awesome, and the value to quality ratio was off the charts.  Clean stylish restaurant, and some really righteous patrons.  I'm talking almost once a week visits, sinking almost $500 into this place over three years.  ...unfortunately there are new owners or something is going on as my last few visits I've observed a discernible downtrend in the portion sizes, and the prices have all been upped.  No longer can I get my 3 pc biftekia and chicken gyro with zucchini fries for $14 - it now comes out to over $20.  That's insane inflation for a standard pricehike and coupled with smaller portions does not make me a happy customer.  I had recruited a small army of people to repeatedly go here for Greek but will now need to find a new place that values the customer experience in true Greek fashion.  If you do go, by the love of all that is holy - get the zucchini fries.  They don't travel or keep well, but out of the fryer they are insane.  They, thankfully, haven't changed."}
{"text":"After grabbing a cortado at Mercury Espresso today, I figured I'd finally get around to trying this place out.   The first thing you'll probably notice is how small the menu is. I'd looked at the menu before but seeing it in the \"flesh\" really drives home how minimalistic it is. I'd be exaggerating if I tried to call it zen-like but what else do you do when all you are faced with in terms of pita toppings are tzatziki, red onions, tomatoes, and french fries?   I ordered the bifteki pita along with a side of zucchini fries.   Really glad to see that the zucchini fries were made to order (precut slices were tossed with batter before going into the fryer).  The portion was generous to the point where I felt like a glutton for having eaten all of it. These things are damn tasty. Lightly battered, crunchy, not overly oily, and still distinctly zucchini-like, I would order these again (just not by myself) and they're a steal at just 3 bucks.  The bifteki pita was pretty delicious. The taste of the pork/beef mixture with onions and spices really comes through thanks to the small amount of fillings in the pita. The tzatziki is somehow noticeably better in taste than the tzatziki you'd commonly find in squeeze bottles at many gyro/pita contemporaries around town.   The menu is pared down to the bare minimum (3 pitas, 4 plates, 2 salads, 3 sides, and pork skewers). The prices are great for the portions that you get. They have a small selection of bottled beers (I noticed Steam Whistle as well as Heineken) along with glasses of house red/white wine. What's not to like?  This feels like the closest that you can get to a purist's notion of great Greek fast food in Toronto and even if it wasn't, it still makes for good eating."}
{"text":"I was a regular customer when they had first opened and found the food to be great. I don't know if there's a new owner, but the last few times I got gyro and gyro dinners from here they've been meh. Went last week and picked up the gyro dinner with only salad. Half way threw the meal I sensed that something wasn't right with the food. Glad I stopped when I did but this didn't prevent the food poisoning I experienced for the next two days. Too bad...must be new owners not sure if their hearts into it like the old owners' was. They've also expanded their menu, which is never a good sign"}
{"text":"Love this place, my daughter who is a hyper kid is always welcomed like family and food is very well made!"}
{"text":"For the price and what you are getting I think it's the best chicken-souvlaki-dinner-take-out in the area. The lemony sauce on the chicken is great, the bread is soft, fresh and grilled with a yummy garlic butter spread melted on top. And it puts all the other Greek salads on the Danforth to shame. They are the only takeout place I have ever seen give you more than one olive.  That alone gets a star.  We just did take-out there again today and I was inspired to post right away. It's our new go-to take-out for souvlaki. I just wish they delivered!  On a more negative note, the restaurant itself is not amazing, and I wasn't a huge fan of the zucchini fries - they were extremely greasy."}
{"text":"Nice little gem, just north of Danforth.  Best gyros in town!! Chicken souvlaki dinner is amazing as well. Price is very reasonable for the amazing food.  Quick and friendly service if you want to eat in. Very clean and nice atmosphere!! 5++"}
{"text":"Tasty and satisfying Greek fast food, in a welcoming environment. Fried zucchini fries are amazing."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about folia grill. I walked in here a couple years ago now probably when they first opened (different owners at the time). I love the authentic greek food they have here. I usually only get the souvlaki pita, but everything on the menu sounds and looks delicious. This is a great place to try if you live in the pape area and LOVE greek food !! :)"}
{"text":"This place is good. The food is handmade, and cooked fresh. I've had their pork souvlaki, folia burger, onion rings and fries. I can't wait to try the chicken gyro! The owners are really friendly and welcoming. My favourite neighbourhood Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"Yummy food! Cheap and loads to eat as well. Perfect casual atmosphere for friends and family on a lazy day. It is pretty small I wouldn't advise more than 4 people at once."}
{"text":"I'm editing my original post.  We went back again and I have to say their food has gone downhill. Badly downhill.  We ordered two gyros and both were terrible.  My chidken euro was filled with mostly fat and skin with way too much thin sauce that I believe was tzatziki and so much grease you could see it swimming on top of the sauce , and the pork gyro tasted like vinegar. I won't go back. Overall not good at all - I left most of my food there. Too bad as my previous review went like this: Excellent food! We started with an absolutely delicious greek salad which was made with the freshest ingredients and was served with a slab of quality feta cheese and a large helping of wonderful olives.  We then shared the very large pork euro plate - yummy -  which was served with a side of  zucchini fries (a lovely alternative to the typical greek fries, though they have those, too). I'll definitely return  again.  As the five stars indicate, this is as good as it gets!!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken gyros is as authentic as it gets right down to the French fries in the pita.  Well done, my friends!"}
{"text":"I went by tonight because of all the great reviews. My husband and I got a pork and chicken gyro and a side of zucchini fries. The gyros were the best I've ever had. The pork gyro was delicious. The chicken one was really good also but it was mainly all dark meat with some skin and there were some cartilage like pieces. They gyros were $5.25 each they're so worth it. We would have been full with just a gyro each but we had to try the zucchini fries. These must be eaten immediately, we really enjoyed them. It will now be our go to gyro place."}
{"text":"Hard to find better, fresher Chicken Gyro anywhere and the price tag is amazing. I usually skip the fries tucked inside and enjoy watching them stuff it so full of meat that I can hardly believe it fits in the foil wrap. Folia is perfect for take out , but there is generally a table available for eat in. The dinner plate is my daughters favourite and there is enough for 2.5 to dine from--including a picky 5 year old. The tzatziki dip is her favourite. The zucchini fries are delicious but need salt. the traditional greek salad comes with the best hunk of feta and the hot grilled pita is amazing. Can't go wrong, unless you show up too late and they've run out of chicken! try the pork instead if you do."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars for a couple of reasons.  First, the food is very consistent.  Everything always tastes fresh and not once have I discarded any food.  Second, the owner is a very nice guy and tries hard to service his customers' well.  A very unique place."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood gem in the heart of Pape Villiage with authentic Greek fastfood."}
{"text":"update... new owners have made it more expensive and smaller portions.    I used to eat at Messinis until I found this place.  The chicken is delicious.  The prices are ok.  The thing I like the most about it is that they put lots of meat on the gyro. The only recommendation would be for them to buy the coin shaped fries for the Greek Fries.  You can buy them down by Carlaw st.   Either way this place deserves 5 starts."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a bite.  I ordered a chicken souvlaki single dinner.  It came with 2 slices  of toast, a salad, the plate had 2 pieces of potatoes, rice, tzaziki and the one chicken souvlaki stick.  The price was $12.49+tax.  The salad was large, but the plate portion was not.  I expected a bit more food, but it was delicious.  4 stars for the great taste, but a bit expensive for the amount you get.  C.L."}
{"text":"I followed an online recommendation and walked up from the Pape Metro, about ten minutes.  It was well worth the journey.  Everything fresh and made to order.  The two servers prepared my plate and the plates around me with great care and presented them politely.  That was just start of it.  The pork gyro meal was heavenly and almost too much to eat.  I could have easily shared this with a friend and the price of the meal was very good on the pocketbook.  The pork was served heaping with a big wedge of lemon and the salad, with fresh tomato and cucumber around a bed of lettuce was yet another mountain on the plate.  Fresh, warm pita and tzatziki graced a second plate served with the meal.  So, if you want to escape the main drag and enjoy a king's feast in a quiet surrounding, head for Folia."}
{"text":"My local college has been promoting this place and seeing that yelpers are raving about this place, I decided to give this a try and since they have a student special.   I ordered the student special for takeout which is a chicken gyro and a drink for $6 and considering there wasn't any tax included, i thought it was quite worth it than King's. The gyro itself like Messini has fries in it.   The chicken gyro was quite greasy that it soaked into the pita and the fries did not really compliment the taste. But half-way into finishing my gyro, I almost ate a toothpick that was stick onto one of the chicken. Good thing I didn't eat it or else I might choke myself to death.   The place is clean but I seriously doubt that all the reviewers below me have legit accounts. I will NOT be coming back to this place....  Messini down in the Danforth is a much more better gyro place than this."}
{"text":"3.5  The food was good, nothing over the top impressive. The place was small and much more of a place for take out.  I was disappointed that there was no lamb there.  We got there near closing one night and were looking for a sit down place to eat so it was pretty awesome that they let us stay and finish our meals before closing."}
{"text":"The best gyros are served here. Delicious garlic flat bread smothered with just the right amount of tziki with onions and tomatoes and a huge amount of chicken or pork and topped with a few fries to balance out all the meat. Its bursting and requires a toothpick to hold it together! The prices are very reasonable as you can get a huge gyro and a soda for around 10 bucks. If you want some fries as well it's an extra 2 bucks or so but I don't recommend the fries because you'll be too full!   The staff is friendly and generous and the restaurant itself is small but very clean and modern. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is actually my favorite place to get a gyro now and that's saying a lot since we live in the heart of greek town. The gyro's are priced very well and have fries in them which I love.  While it's greek ish food, the restaurant itself doesn't seem strictly greek to me. My favorite wrap of theirs is actually the chicken one which is shaved off a rotisserie like a shwarma. I thought traditional greek only did this with lamb/beef gyro's but maybe I'm wrong.  The meat is always incredibly moist though and make sure you get the fries because they put some seasoning on it that's magical.  The zucchini fries are also incredible deep fried goodness so what the heck get an order of them too!  The only downside of this place is that there's very limited seating inside. It's really just a takeout spot and I'd love to be able to take friends there and sit down to have a meal."}
{"text":"Folia Grill is an awesome alternative... rather than having to trek your bum down to the Danforth for some Greek food. They've undergone a management change, but it's still quite good (They're actually open on Sundays now versus when they were under previous management so that's a plus).  Whenever I go to Folia, I usually order the chicken gyro. I love their pitas because they're extremely fluffy and yummy. The chicken is seasoned really well. It's not your usual gyro seasoning, but it still tastes great. They also do a great job at loading up on the tzatziki (it's the best part) and their fries are always golden, crispy, and good.  I have also started getting the chicken gyro plate, which is way more than enough food for one person to finish. I was drowning in my dinner, but it was so damn good.  One thing that I have to say is that it is just a bit salty at times. This doesn't happen as often anymore, but sometimes the chicken is just a bit too salty. Anyways, besides that, it's a great place to go for lunch or dinner. Tons of food for a great price!"}
{"text":"Summary: Good food, nice decor, solid service, reasonable prices, small place, parking can be awkward.  Really nice gyros: the meat is moist and tasty, the inclusion of fries in the gyro is fun.  The fries, greek fries and zucchini fries are all good. The decor is nice, they've clearly put some thought into making the place look good.  The service is solid. They're reasonably speedy at assembling your meal, and they're friendly. The prices are reasonable without being especially high or low.  It's a small place. There isn't a lot of seating and the bathroom is closet-sized.  Parking can be a bit awkward when Pape is really busy, but most of the time I've been able to get something reasonably nearby.  They're also licensed to serve alcohol, although I haven't taken advantage of that."}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better than this.. Absolutely delicious in just about every dish..The pork souvlaki on a stick or pita is to die for..So tender no other restaurants can duplicate this and I don't know why..The chicken gyro and pork gyro is also delicious and tender and so is the chicken souvlaki on a stick or on a pita...the Folia burger is out of this world..The Calamari is just that good too..I tried almost everything on the menu I can go on but I don't usually write long reviews unless it's this good..And before I forget you MUST try the Zucchini fries with the Folia sauce it's OMG good!!! And let me conclude the portions are HUGE! Don't see why some naysayers on here put it down unless they work for the competition it's hard to find anything bad there trust me on this go try it out and no other Greek restaurant compares. Did I mention their prices are also the cheapest?"}
{"text":"First time at this joint and I loved it!! The workers are so friendly and even let my indecisive companion taste the gyro meat. Their portions are HUUUUGE and the meat to pita ratio is completely ridiculous in a good way. My mouth dropped when they placed a mountain of fries on the pita and then I almost fainted when an even larger mountain of chicken was placed on it! The seasoning is unique from other joints I've been too, will definitely be returning to this place and recommending it to people in the office."}
{"text":"I have had pork gyros here around 7 or more times and they are incredibly tasty. The amount of meat on the pita is enormous and they put it together better than any other gyro I have had.  Tons of \"bark\" on the meat and it is very easy to eat because of the way they wrap it.  Bravos for sure."}
{"text":"The BEST Greek food! Honesty I've been to every Greek restaurant on the danforth and folia grill knocks them out of the park. Great prices, great selection, friendly staff and the YUMMIEST food !!!!!:-)"}
{"text":"Pretty terrible customer service when I went in. I had been there a few times and never really had a bad experience. Food was pretty average but no real complaints. Then today when I went in the server decided he would give me a mini lecture about saying please and thank you when asking for food in a restaurant. And while I don't disagree it was beyond unpleasant and uncalled for. I highly doubt I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"Best chicken gyro I've ever experienced. Good price. Good folks.  Look forward to getting back here again soon!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Folia Grill looking for a cheap place to eat that was open past 9. I looked at the menu and somehow felt it was going to be good. I was definitly not dissapointed. I ordered the Biftekia because it sounded the most interesting. I got 3 pieces for 7 bucks including a side of fries. Not too shabby eh? The food was prepared fresh right in front of us in the open kitchen which was nice to see. I've never had biftekia before this and I'd describe it as a larger oval shaped meat ball. It was pretty delicious and very filling. It tasted just like I imagine it was supposed to - lots of that great ground meat flavour combined with seasoning. There was also some pita and tzatziki which was good too. The pita tasted a lot better and was a lot softer than most places I've eaten at. The owner was really friendly and allowed me to sample the zuchini fries before ordering them. Except the sample was an entire plate full with their sauce on the side. I ended up ordering the zuchini fries which weren't too bad although I really don't liek eating vegetables. Perhaps frying them made them a little tasty. On our way out we started chatting with the owner who gave us some feta cheese and pork to sample. They tasted really good, perhaps just as nice as the biftekia. The property is great too and looks liek it has been recently done up. Definitly a lot more upmarket than the prices would have you believe. Overall a great experience and definitly not my last time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We used to frequent Folia Grill a lot!  The food was so fresh, portions were generous, really great pitas, and you can get a combination of chicken and pork.  But, for the last year, the portions have shrunk drastically, food is inconsistent, especially when the older man is working the grill, fries are always cold as he doesn't seem to able to coordinate everything, even when it isn't busy.  Agree with Sarah O., the staff doesn't wash their hands in between handling everything (orders, money, etc.).  Really wish they'd revert back to the good food we remembered, along with better food handling practices. Don't think we'll be back for a while.  So sad."}
{"text":"Went there to order take out, my husband and I went there for their gyros (we had the pork gyro before it was okay, a bit dry)  and while waiting I was reading their menu and I saw that they also have fish and chips which I was craving for days. I asked my husband to order it for me and when he did the cook who was also manning the counter gave him an attitude. He whispered \"you should've ordered everything at once\" and my husband was like \"do you have a problem?\" And the guy said \"no, I don't have a problem, I just thought it would be faster if you ordered your food at the same time.\"  It felt like he was rushing or something. He made us feel like we're stupid for not ordering everything at once when it was after we ordered that I saw they also have the fish and chips on their menu, so what was I supposed to do. Service sucked my husband vowed never to go back there again."}
{"text":"I got the zucchini fries thanks to the tips on Yelp and boy was it good! I also got a wrap here and it was very filling. You can choose your own toppings which is nice. The tzatziki sauce was perfect. I have no complaints at all! Good food for a good price."}
{"text":"Had the souvlaki chicken with rice potatoes and salad. The food was alright, nothing special. What made me mad was the Incredibly small portion given for 13$ which is ridiculous considering you could get food elsewhere that tastes better with larger portions and cheaper. Would never come back here again, ever."}
{"text":"Friendly folks. Good value. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here on Boxing Day at an odd hour so it was very empty and our orders were taken immediately. The pork gyro was absolutely delicious! The meat was juicy and oh so flavourful with the perfect amount of seasoning. They were so generous with the amount of meat and filling that it was spilling over the top - not a bad problem to have!   The pita wrap had great texture, hot and fluffy with a slight chew which I really enjoyed. The fries in the gyro was also a nice touch. Me and my boyfriend devoured the wrap in 5 minutes and regretted sharing one dish. We have told our friends about this gem and will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"After changing ownership several times, I was worried that Folia Grill would not be the same, there were a few changes to the menu, but thankfully those amazing Zucchini fries are still there and just as addictive and delicious as ever!  A new addition is the chicken souvlaki, similar to the chicken breast it is marinated in lemon which gives it a wonderful flavour.  The salads taste so fresh and are perfectly dressed.  The quality of feta is amazing.  After reading some bad reviews here on Yelp since the last change of ownership, I was worried about coming back, but I am glad I decided to take a chance.  The food is as good as ever.  Hubby loves the Chicken Gyros and doesn't understand why other places don't put fries in their pita sandwiches.. it holds in all the tasty juices!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and beyond amazing owners and staff. The folia sauce is to die for and the chicken gyro yummmmm!!! You have to try this place if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Folia Grill describes itself as serving Greek Fast Food. Really good Greek Fast Food. The owners know the Greek street food food they are inspired by very well and they do an excellent job at making it. I have no quibbles about the food at all.  We recently went for lunch.  When you first walk in the decor is so nice and clean it takes a second to realize that the service is fast food style, not waited tables. There were only two staff, a woman doing most of the cooking and a guy who did everything else, looking at the website these are the owners.  There was a little bit of business over getting a table despite their being 12 seats and only 5 other patrons. The table we wound up at was interesting as it was directly opposite the kitchen so we got to watch the action. For what is basically a fast food joint I was generally impressed, in particular that the salads were made fresh from fresh ingredients, OK the french fries were frozen from a bag but everything else except the pita bread (which was excellent) seemed to be made in house (in some cases, like the bifteki and the zucchini sticks obviously pre-made but not brought in frozen). All of the food looked really good and the portions were beyond generous. So here's the first caution, there's one cook, there's really no expediting and some things like hand chopping veggies for each village salad to order takes a little time, we we're cool with this, well worth it for well prepared food, but some of the patrons who came in for quick takeout seemed a little annoyed.  Caution number two is that the owners insistence on authenticity seems a little fusty. When we were there someone came in, perused the short menu for a second and asked why they didn't have chicken souvlaki, the answer was \"because that wouldn't be authentic,  they don't cook chicken that way in Greece, only pork and lamb\" the guy looked stunned for a second then turned around and walked out.   There were a bunch of really minor service hiccups while we were there, nothing that was enough to put me off the place, but things that felt like first week jitters which shouldn't still be there as they have been open for a few months now.  We each had a pork souvlaki pita and shared an order of zucchini sticks, that and two bottles of water came out to less than 15 bucks for both of us. The sandwiches were very good, although next time I think I would probably opt for the gyros (chicken only) or the bifteki. The zucchini sticks were delicious and the portion insanely huge for the price, we couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"How can anyone give folia a bad review? The kind of people who like bland, dry, run of the mill, unmemorable greek food. Disregard those low reviews when you consider visiting folia.    I love this place. I have since they opened, it quickly became my go-to when I'm hungry and not cooking. Cheap, friendly(ish) staff, but above all, seriously delicious. Best chicken gyro in greektown, and yes, I have tried them all. I cant even finish it, we usually split one. Everything on the menu is great, and heck when I'm just craving a plate of fries I always think of folia's. I'd love a poutine with them....  The menu has recently been updated and changed, so I'm looking forward to trying the new options :)"}
{"text":"Folia Grill has the juiciest tastiest pork souvlaki ($1.95) in town. It is served with a wedge of lemon to cut the fattiness of the pork belly! Charcoal, pork belly, sea salt and lemon....nom.   Their thick cut zucchini fries ($4.50) are equally fabulicious! The fries are served with a side of spiced mayonnaise! Zucchini is one of those vegetables that are high in water content. To fully enjoy these awesome fries, you have to eat it while it is crispy and piping HOT!  Their grilled pitas ($.75) are crunchy and great with the home-made refreshing tzatziki ($1.50)! What a great steal! The tazatziki has a lot less garlic than most Greek restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"I am so sorry to write this review. Folia was our go to. And then after a bad day/week I ordered take out for me and my kids. When it arrived there was no tzatziki. Ok I get it, mistakes happen, I can live with that, except for how rudely I  was treated after. I called and the man who answered yelled at me when I asked if skewers come with tzatziki. He said 'I don't know. I'm busy call back later!\" I called back immediately. First I wanted to know if it was missing. He then just picked up the phone and hung up. I don't know if his is the owner or an employee but regardless, it's completely inappropriate and not how a business should treat a paying customer. I spent $40 there that evening and willing to spend more. But I guess they don't care. The only positive was the woman I spoke to who genuinely felt bad. It's a shame because the danforth is teeming with Greek food so competition is tough. I'll take my hard earned money where I am treated with respect."}
{"text":"I tried the gyro souvlaki and it was delicious. Good service,  small but comfy. It is clean and colourful. I recommend it."}
{"text":"It is truly a shame that I've been living across from this place for almost a year now and have only just visited it for the first time tonight!  I ordered the Pork Gyro Pita to go... It had amazing fresh flavours hat I'm definitely going to be coming back for! Came to $7 even. They could have charged me $10 and it still would have been worth the money it was that good!"}
