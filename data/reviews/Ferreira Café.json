{"text":"Literally, as good as it gets.  We got there early, so we might've gotten lucky, as it soon became packed!  Service was impeccable and the food was phenomenal.  Portuguese style grilled shrimp, was one of the most flavorful seafood dishes I've had in a while.  The risotto was perfectly al dente and beautifully seasoned, the shrimp were marinated, grilled and served whole, with the shells removed except for the head and tail which removed easily. It also came with what was described as a salsa, which could also be described as  a fresh chopped tomato, pepper relish-less saucy and more like a pico de gallo, but seasoned wonderfully.  I also tried the Sardines which were fresh and grilled-very robust, as sardines are and served with a sundried tomato relish, which really rounded out the dish. Also tried the Salt Cod Braz style, which was agreed upon to be described as a hash, with a stunning presentation.  It was very rich, but wonderful. The Grilled Angus reserve rib eye, truffle puree, red wine, was hands down, one of the best pieces of beef I've had in recent memory and the truffled mashed potatoes were delicious.  It was also served with a bone full of marrow which we spread on some bread.  For dessert, the Natas were a must have -small vanilla custard in pastry shells with a dusting of cinnamon, and were served with a small scoop of caramel ice cream. A perfect combination with the strong and satisfying Portuguese espresso.  The wine list was all Portuguese wines, which we weren' familiar with, but our server who was spectacular, recommended a beautiful earthy red, and a nice dry glass of white. I apologize for not keeping track of the names. A great experience in an amazing food mecca.  A little pricey, but I will surely be back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Traveling the world we discover many cuisines and great restaurants,Italian, Greek,French, but one part of the Mediterranean that Montreal has in its community is Portugal and the restaurant that does an incredible job that makes the locals proud is Ferreira Cafe. Carlos Ferreira has introduced Portuguese cuisine at its finest and the reputation of Ferreira is Global. Now If only if we could convince him to open elsewhere in North America we would make Portuguse cuisine with its simplicity and freshness with emphasis on Seafood an experience to be shared by everyone. Unfortunately you will need to travel to Montreal to enjoy the finest Portuguese cuisine. We started the evening with a tapas platter that consisted of wonderful Tuna Tartar, Octopus, grilled Calamari, Chorizo a Portuguse sausage,and their famous Grilled Sardines everything done to perfection and so fresh that it echoed the sea of the Meditteranean. We enjoyed as main course Dover Sole that melted in your mouth and three different paella variations one consisting of Duck confit, clams,shrimps,lobster,black cod,in a broth made simply with their own juices. The black cod with its edgy finish was in a league of its own with a flakiness that rivaled Chilean Sea Bass.We finished the evening sharing a chocolate fondue and vanilla bean ice cream that made the evening unforgettable. We had not been to Ferreira in a while one reason  being the difficulty in getting a reservation so early calls for a table is mandatory and it's location downtown makes it a favourite among the tourists."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We had the sampler platter of calamari, quail, sardines and chouri√ßo to start, then porcini crusted cod and seabass as the main courses. They were all delicious except we had to wait 65 minutes from the time we ordered until the starter arrived. Apparently, something went wrong in the kitchen and the waiter informed us it would take longer casually without an apology. The wine was disappointing and overpriced. Because we had sat there for so long waiting for our food, we decided to leave after our main courses, walk around a bit and take a dessert somewhere else. The waiter responded with a tone of disbelief when we told him we would not have dessert. The food definitely deserves 5 stars, but factoring in the poor service and overpriced wine, I can only give this place a 3."}
{"text":"Service was good but somewhat spotty. We had to ask for bread or refills. With that aside, I had the best seafood dish ever. I ordered the porcini crusted black cod. Amazing! We sat down right away considering it was a bustling Friday night. Glad we found this place."}
{"text":"Exceptional.  You will think you are in France.  Salads were good, but entrees with sauces etc were perfection.  Ask for Mayo sauce with frites and it's a flavored Mayo with orange color, wonderful add to fresh amazing fries.  The strip steak and mushroom fish couldn't have been better, and my husband and I frequent Paris."}
{"text":"Has everything going for it. Location, Location, variety of food in Montreal.  My wife and I were in Montreal for business from San Francisco, so I have a benchmark to rate the food and service for a fine dining and Portuguese cuisine. Reviews should be focused on food and menu recommendations as they give the reader something to look forward to.   I will speak of the food briefly as the poor service overshadowed the near memorable meal.  I had the lamb and remember a fantastic dry rub(garam masala-ish) and pistachio flavored the cut, with cous cous(hard to mess up).  Unfortunately it takes the other side of the coin, SERVICE to sour the memory of a $$$ bill.    I arrived 30 minutes early to meet my party for dinner in a full suit (no tie), walked passed the hostess station(busy with clients) to scope out the bar and find members of my party.  Not seeing anyone, I proceeded to the staircase towards the middle of the rest. to use the bathroom.  A hostess/server asked if she could help me with something, seeing that I was looking for someone.  I told her that I was expecting a party for dinner, and was on my way to the mens room .  She then proceeded to find out if I had a reservation, and made it clear that she was going to get the bottom of the case of: \" a 30 year old man in a nice suit trying to use the bathroom with out any intention of patronizing their establishment.\"  Giving her our party name and telling her that I did not see anyone was not enough for her.  I felt very unwelcome from the start.  I did not expect the table service to be the Ritz Carlton SF, but they were below par in that dept. as well. Finally, we ordered a bottle of red wine to accompany some of our diners meals and it arrived very cold even for a cellars temp.  We asked the server if we could decant the wine to help with this, and it took three reminders.  After that the experience went uphill.  This rant is to hopefully a someone who can encourage the staff here that humans are inanely good and you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar.   Will change the star rating up a bit for recipe of lamb dry rub, if someone cares to respond.   Regards,"}
{"text":"Right from the \"get go\" here I am going to qualify my remarks by stating that has been a little while since I have been to this restaurant, but if TRUE Portuguese food is what you crave then you are best to avoid this place like the plague!  If, however, you have no experience with TRUE Portuguese cuisine then you may actually like this place.  There is nothing wrong with the food or the service, it is just that this place is NOT the real deal when it comes to Portuguese restaurants.  I discovered four glaring problems with this place.  First off, when my wife (who is from Fall River, MA - which is practically a part of the Azores) and I arrived we were asked the one question never asked in a TRUE Portuguese restaurant which was, \"Do you have a reservation?\"  When I advised that we did not we were told that we could not be accommodated, but that we were free to sit and order at the bar which was fine by me.  This however, brings us to the second problem.  When my entree came it appeared to look more like an appetizer than an entree.  Now, those who know Portuguese cuisine know that you NEVER leave any TRUE Portuguese restaurant hungry.  At this place I left hungry! :o(  The third problem I discovered was that very few of the staff spoke Portuguese!  This is a major \"red flag\" for anyone who knows Portuguese food.  If the staff does not speak Portuguese then you \"aint\" eatin' in a Port-o-gee restaurant.  Lastly, and I know all my Portuguese brethern will back me up on this item, this place is pricey!  The best reason to go to a Portuguese restaurant is that Portuguese people are notoriously parsimonious so prices in real Portuguese restaurants have to be cheap else Portuguese people will not patronize.  Thankfully, the Portuguese diaspora has brought many a Benfica fan to Canada and there are a lot of Portuguese restaurants in Montreal.  Try any of the places on Boulevard St. Laurent in the vicinity of Duluth for the best that Portugal has to offer and steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"We didn't like the service. Server forgot to bring bread to our tables and then waited 30 minutes to get our vines. It is such an expensive restaurant so we expected little better service quality. Also food portions were very small especially the appts.  Wouldn't go there again"}
{"text":"The best seafood medley with rice I have ever tasted. The qualify of the seafood was outstanding and very flavorful without killing the favor of the seafood. Generous portions as well. I would recommend the sardine appetizer. Great service despite being so crowded."}
{"text":"Excellent service and perfectly executed food in a lovely space. I also appreciated being able to hear  my companion's voice from across our table, despite being packed with people.  A big thank you to the aesthetically pleasing sound insulation panels...  De-licious and De-lovely"}
{"text":"This is a really great place where the touted head chef is not only present , but working the entire time.  We literally watched him in awe all night checking each dish and putting the final touches on each dish before it left his kitchen.  You often hear a lot about head chefs these days....but rarely actually see them in the kitchen, if at all.    The food was mint!  We started off with (3) enormous grilled shrimp with some type of garlic olive sauce.  For an entree I got the seafood rice casserole.  It comes to the table in a copper sauce pot.  It was choked full of scallops, calamari, fish heads, clams and shrimp.  My wife got the rib eye which I tried.....damn good, steakhouse quality.    The service was ok.... they were trying.  They had a real large group that they were struggling to keep up with.  We had 3 different waiters because they were trying to help the other guy out.  When you are paying that much money for dinner it should be a little more organized.  Bring your wallet....it was just my wife and I,  app, entrees, dessert and 2 drinks each = 2 bills.    Go for the food!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was full and the hostess found me a spot on the bar. I was skeptical at first but catch of the day fish was amazingly well done surrounded by great accompanying ingredients. The only small detail the reason why not 5 was the attention to details from servers who forgot to serve me bread or offer any of the usual pepper, salt etc."}
{"text":"We came to Ferreira during our visit to Montreal. We were a party of 2. Seated promptly, The place was jam packed on this saturday evening.  We had filet of Sardines and a tostada. Filet mignon which was pretty small. And the best dish was a whole grilled silver Porgy fish. It was great and better than our usual med seabass.   The service was simply perfect. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"So, on a recent trip we made reservations at Joe Beef and PDC but we left one night open and ended up here.  Having done so, I wish we could have ditched our earlier reservations and just eaten here every night.  The food was terrific and the service was some of the best we have ever received - one of the really great things was how accommodating they were when my wife and I said we wanted to share appetizers and an entre (dividing it in the kitchen and serving it on individual plates is the sign of a really well-run establishment).  Really, this restaurant is a gem - Montreal is lucky to have it!"}
{"text":"The new management has really got it wrong with its new \"headwear\" policy for clients.  Myself and other patrons find it inappropriate & too uptight for the Montreal market.  Instead of focusing on what clients are wearing, the management should concentrate on the quality of the food and the uptight service.  I could go on complaining about the cocktails and how lousy the food was prepared, but I want to concentrate on the \"new restaurant policies\" that are just not represented of Montreal.  It was a very unpleasant experience and will not be returning anytime soon.  I also think I need an apology for this rude behaviour of the management.  Thanks Rene"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the boullabaisse!!!  It was a huge pot with tasty broth filled with seafood.  It could've totally been shared and I felt like an idiot ordering it for just me? My husband had the seafood rice casserole.. also very tasty and something that could've been shared vs. a single order. The other couple each got the alaskan cod dish which looked amazing and they were very happy with it.  I definitely recommend this place and would return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"waaaayyy overpriced - entrees avg about $40 each.  Pros- our entrees were great but we definitely would have been ok with 1/2 the portion size and 1/2 the price. The place offers a special 3-course $24 menu at 10pm but we got there just a tad too early to take advantage of it.   Cons- restaurant was very loud; tables are set so closely together that our waitress had a hard time checking on us; service was very slow and less attentive than what a restaurant of this repute should provide; restroom was dirty (again, for a restaurant of this caliber and how much we paid, I expect the entire package- great food, service, cleanliness and atmosphere); appetizer of grilled calamari was flavorful but overcooked/tough."}
{"text":"Meilleur resto portugais de Montr√©al, avec une cave tr√®s √©labor√©e"}
{"text":"Best meal of our Montreal trip and best I have had in a while. Started with the oyster Portuguese style then the piri piri shrimp on linguini as a main, delicious. My daughter is vegan and though there were no vegan meals on the menu the chef created a vegetable dish with rice that was amazing. Service was great and decor very elegant. Will definitely return on my next trip."}
{"text":"The restaurant is best with its thoughtfully designed dishes, but the overall experience is weakened by the unthoughtful service, or simply the waiter that we have encountered.  Fresh caught menu offers a pleasant surprise. We've ordered Mediterranean bass cooked in whole. The grilled fish is juicy and tender under crispy skin. Mildly salted and spices, the cooking brought out the essence of the fish's natural taste. The dish comes with a special salsa, grilled greens and mashed sweet potato. The salsa goes well with the fish because the overall sour taster and rich texture really invigorate the tasting buds, making the fish feels even more fresh and tender. The salsa contains some green peppercorn-like pickles in addition to the regular ingredients, and it is not soupy. The mashed sweet potato is richer and more interesting.  The seafood Bouillabaisse is a potato-base soup with a variety of seafood and potato. It's adequate portion and it was brought in a warm le crueset cast iron oven. Well proportioned ingredients and fresh seafood make the dish better than similar dishes in other places, and it is a good choice for a winter my dinner.  We've also tried the grilled calamari for appetizer. The calamari is of good quality and grilled to a turn, but tastes a bit bland in itself. The green sauce is herbal and bitter, yet complemented with the sweet orange color sauce, giving dish quite an interesting flavor.   Now comes the downside. The waiter is rather unresponsive and cold, offering very little suggestions and make us feel that he does not care. The bread offered before appetizer is cold and tough, quite disappointing comparing to the level of the cuisine this restaurant would like to boast."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriends had a dinner at Ferreira while in Montreal.  The ambiance of the place is very nice and romantic, so we were very hopeful at first.  I have to say the service was amazing and we were served immediately.  Unfortunately all of us found the food to be too greasy. The house salad I had as an appetizer was the most delicious dish I had that night. Fish of the day was okay, but again too greasy for my liking.  Overal, we found everything to be okay, but wouldn't go back, as the restaurant is VERY pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"I had a halibut filet. It was good but nothing fabulous and for 40$ I was expecting fabulous.  My husband got the mushroom and duck risotto. That was very good, rich and golden with a confit duck leg and oyster mushrooms, well worth the 36$. Our friend got the bouillabaisse. It was delicious but smallish for the price."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of months ago for my birthday. I had once been here for a conference and knew their steak was yummy. They did not have filet mignon on their menu but still offered to make it for me which was great. My hubby got the nlack cod but did not seem too impressed by it. My steak was medium to well  when i had ordered it med rare. By the time i got my dinner my hubby was done his :( only downfall of the night. The calamari app was very good."}
{"text":"Returned to Ferreira and was thoroughly disappointed.  Food was still good, but service was clearly lacking.  It took forever to receive my order and when it finally came it wasn't what I had asked for.  The waitress wasn't terribly apologetic and nothing was discounted from the bill.    --- Was visiting Montr√©al for a conference and had Ferreira Caf√© recommended to me as the place to go for quality seafood in Downtown.  I sat at the bar and was delighted with both my appetizer and entree. Save this for special occasions as it isn't exactly cheap."}
{"text":"Best place in Montreal if you enjoy seafood and great ambiance. You gotta try the tartares, oysters and black cod. My favourite is the bouillabaisse with shrimps, scallops, calamaris, rice and coriander."}
{"text":"Wow! If this is how you eat in Portugal, put me on a plane. Seafood for two was perfect--everything tender. Scallops are so easy to mess up. Fries were delish. The roasted vegetables were excellent. And the mushroom side was also great. A little wait before they took our order, and a little slow to refill our water, but overall good service."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant. Came here with three other foodie types from NYC and expected average but got superb. A whole John Dory fish for two had crisp, crackling skin topping moist flesh; the bouillabaisse was delicate and expertly seasoned, a halibut dish was delicious and visually beautifully plated the fish atop a small tower of vegetables and a dollop of sweet potato pur√©e. For dessert a tasting for two (enough for four to have a sampling) - so good. Buy the house olive to take home - it is a palate pleaser. Appetizers are interesting and even a plain green salad was perfectly dressed and fresh. Service added to the great experience ...seamless, knowledgeable, and friendly. Added bonus? A lovely room to boot. Have your wallet opened....perfection comes at a price!"}
{"text":"We came for the late night menu -- $24 for appetizer and entree.  Seemed like it might be a good deal.  Seafood boulibase was suppose to have shellfish in it (according to our server) and yet all it had were chunks of monk fish.  I inquired after the meal arrived and the server said, \"Oh, the boulibase on the regular menu has shellfish -- the late night menu just has fish.\" *that would have been nice to know in advance* Also, it was a way over-salted dish.  YUCK! My friend ordered Atlantic Salmon -- again just not that creative or exciting. The $13 martini was the best part of the meal albeit considerably over-priced.  I have to believe there are better options for a good meal in Montreal.    The incredible sandwiches we enjoyed the following day (for lunch) at Olive Et Gourmando were incredible -- would much have preferred those to Ferreira Cafe."}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch with some business colleagues.  The ambiance of this place is very mediterranean and cosy. we had to try to fit 6 people at a 5 person table.  Price is on the higher end. The fish here is superbly delicious. Perfect place to take business clients. Reservations recommended. i would definitely go back."}
{"text":"It was my wife's birthday so I decided to take her on a small trip to Montreal to celebrate (we're from Toronto). She's really enjoys Portuguese food so I decided to take her to Ferreira, it seemed like a no-brainer.   Looking back at it now, I wish we never went there.   The food was fine, I will give them their full credit there. The seafood was prepared very well, especially the octopus in our starter, the grilled seafood for two. It was crispy on the outside and soft (not chewy) on the inside.  The problem with our experience was with the service. This evening was supposed to feel special for my wife, but we were forgotten by our server so often that we felt anything but.  Despite them being notified (via the notes section on the online reservation form) that it was my wife's birthday we experienced the following:  - 20 minutes to get a glass of wine (it would have been longer if I did not remind our server) - Our sides came so long after our mains that we were left with cold seafood casserole and hot vegetables. - We asked for more bread, but it never came (it seemed to find its way to the table beside us when they asked, though)  - Even when we asked for the bill (we just wanted to get out of there) we were left out to dry until I decided to remind our server  After we paid (a $185 tab) we made our way to the door. Our server stopped me and admitted, \"I'm sorry I've left you hanging all night.\" I shook his hand and walked out with my wife. Outside, I turned to her and admitted, \"I'm sorry that I brought you here.\"  Maybe you feel like I'm being a bit dramatic here. Trust me, I'm not the type. If this is just me and the guys on a regular night out, sure I can suck it up. Joke about it, talk a little trash maybe. Definitely not take the time to write out a review. But I ask you, how am I supposed to feel when I see the look on my wife's face gradually go from excitement and anticipation to that of a woman who feels forgotten and unimportant on a day that she holds dear? If I am asked to recount the experience, how can I not call to attention her dissatisfaction?  So because of that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend that anyone give Ferreira their patronage. The quality of their food cannot make up for the disappointment that is their service."}
{"text":"Perfect from start to finish. Service was friendly and helpful. Suggested wine, spot-on for our palate. Oysters to start, then a main of whole John Dory. Porto and creme brulee after dinner. The only think we would have done differently is to get the raw oysters rather than the baked Portuguese-style, but we wanted to give them a try. I was at this restaurant five years ago, and this experience lived up to my memory of it. Thank you for a fabulous evening!"}
{"text":"Excellent souper! La morue sal√©e confite est un d√©lice, tout comme le poisson du march√© √† la portugaise!"}
{"text":"This place was utterly and thoroughly OK.  It would would rate it higher than three stars if it were cheaper.  With cocktails, a bottle of wine, and dinner for two, it ran $272 with tip.  I don't mind spending that much if it is a truly high end experience.  Everything we had was good, but not spectacular.  We will be trying other restaurants in the area instead of this one when we are in town."}
{"text":"Seafood in Montreal sucks the bell-end so rating a seafood restaurant here is like comparing public toilets at a festival. Seriously, how may times are we going to see the same shitty sea-bass and tilapia (raised in sewage) slathered in capers and oil to cover up the rot-aroma from it sitting on ice for an entire week? If you're from the southern US, you're going to be sorely disappointed.   So, aside from that, which is unavoidable in all Montreal restaurants that serve seafood, I have to say that Ferreira is an elegant spot that runs with Cava and Milos and the rest of them. The ambience is really beautiful - there are lots of heirloom-like knickknacks, lamps, tiled wallwork, glass bar and open counters, etc etc to make the place visually very engaging.   The food itself is average to good - nothing on the menu is spectacular, but they sort of do everything well and the decor distracts you into thinking you're experiencing a 5-star meal, which you're totally not. I've had way, and I mean WAY better fish at places like Fogarty's in Key West, and that's a tourist trap in the middle of a tourist street. BUT the overall package is pretty good. A few gripes - mixed meat plates with chorizo, bavette strips, and chicken wings (grand total of $5 of supermarket meat) going for $60 are a bit annoying, as is the waiter waxing poetic about how fresh the sea bass is today (no it's not, the eyes on that fish are clouded over like a muslim cleric in an Al-Qaeda video).  Anyways, go try it out. It's definitely pretty."}
{"text":"Went on a Wed evening around 8:30pm, and it was packed.  My meal was fine (already forgotten what it what), but my friend said the seafood in her paella wasn't very fresh.  They accommodated my request for butter instead of olive oil to go with the bread.  It was pricey, as are many places in this area, and Montreal in general.  (Even at a cafe, I ended up spending $30 on dinner.)  Wish they had more non-seafood dishes, which I know doesn't make sense to say about a Portuguese restaurant, but others have a decent selection of pork, chicken & beef entrees.  I felt under-dressed, but that's more Montreal than the restaurant.  I'd opt to try a new place instead of returning here."}
{"text":"We just returned from a very disappointing dinner at Care Ferreira. We were visiting on business, and were very much looking forward to dinner at this restaurant on our last evening in Montreal -- billed as the best Portuguese food outside Portugal.   My wife had the squash soup with crab as a starter. It was watery and fishy, but OK. She ordered the fresh grilled sea bass, which came with different accompaniments than described. It was so salty it was barely edible. I skipped a starter and ordered the evening's surf and turf, a broiled half lobster and veal chop. The chop was excellent, but the lobster was dry and tasteless. Both were very salty. All-in-all, the food was mediocre at best.  The menu and the food came relatively quickly, but then the service deteriorated dramatically. We had to ask for bread, which appeared to be routinely served to other tables. The waiter never inquired about our food. After an eternity, he appeared from nowhere, and without a word brusquely grabbed our empty plates and disappeared again. He finally dropped desert menus on the table while running by. At this point, we were so disappointed in the food and the ever slower service that we decided to pass and asked for the check -- which took what seemed a lifetime to arrive and even longer to pay. Not once did the server ask if we enjoyed our meal (no!) or thank us for our patronage.   This was a very expensive meal -- around $150 for one glass of wine, one appetizer, and two entrees (admittedly, the surf and turf was expensive at $65). But I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"I tend to overlook bad experiences and just never go back, but I felt compelled to create an account to leave a review after tonight's dinner because the service was so terrible.   We walked into the restaurant and it took 5 minutes to seat us. They gave us one menu between the two of us. Despite having asked for another menu twice, we never got it.   It took half an hour before someone came back to take our order. We ordered a coke (no alcohol on the patio), the scallop and blood sausage spring roll, the cornbread crusted cod, and the vegetable risotto.   Shortly afterward, we got served 3 stale dinner roles and a flat glass of coke ($3.75). The table next to us got a different type of bread. I hope theirs was fresh...  It was another hour before we got our food. The table next to us arrived later and got their appetizer before us. First, they got the vegetable risotto wrong and gave us the seafood paella. My friend was served his cod, only to have it swapped for a different cod dish. (As it turns out, the first dish he was served was the correct one.) We later witness the messed up order was for intended for the other table, who again would have gotten their order first if it wasn't for the mess up.   The appetizer and the original cod dish (which we took a bite of before it was taken away) was delicious. As was the vegetable risotto. The \"corrected\" cod dish was full of bones.   The entire meal was 95 for two people. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Seafood (Portuguese heritage) close by Metro Rue Peel (The Peel station on the Montreal Metro's Green Line near the corner of Peel & De Maisonneuve Blvd. West). Excellent service (Alexandre)! Favorites: Calamari, Octopus. House wine by the glass better than most. LeBlon caipirinha good enough. (Hoping for simpler pinga, or perhaps Boazinha or Vale de Verde next time.) Tasty (mas muito caro) salada de tomate & mozzarella. Ask for price. Excellent experience, but at 9 pm, perhaps shift from hard beat toward Portuguese fado, or Brazilian (ceu, cibelle, marise, astrud), or even forro."}
{"text":"Really good Portuguese Resteruant, daily fresh fish! Nice presentation, good advise from waiter! Love the scallop and grouper!"}
{"text":"Oh my! I loved loved foods here. Unlike some of the reviews below, three of girls had a fabulous time here at Ferreira.  We got an undivided attention from our waiter (his name slips my mind...but he was a hottie for sure!). What I loved about him is that he had  a very strong sense of what is good and he didn't hesitate to let us know what will be best for us. And I loved him for his honesty!  Ambiance was laid back, chill. Pretty older crowd for us three girls but we didn't mind since we are quite old souls. =)  we ordered lots of seafood from appetizer to entree and they were exquisite. sea bass practically melted on our mouths. portions were very generous in general.  hopefully i get to revisit montreal sometime in future. if i do, i will definitely come to this place again!"}
{"text":"Great Portugese restaueant located downtown.  I can't vouch for its authenticity since I don't eat authentic Portuguese everyday however I can most certainly vouch for how good the food tasted.  I went all seafood save for the beef tartar and everybody was great.   It was a beautiful restaurant with impeccable service, don't remember my server's name but he made the whole experience whole. Gave us good information and recommendation without being pushy at all.   Will definitely out other dishes when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Amaaaaaazing food. I've never had Portuguese food but if it's like this I can eat every day. I had blood orange mojito to start off which was pretty but was ok, not worth $15 ! I would have ordered wine instead. The appy I ordered grilled calamari and they were yummy chewy and good portioned. 4-5 sizable calamaris. Definitely a good plate to share. The main of course I had to have black cod that everyone is raving about. I sat facing the kitchen and every time I see a black cod shone under the red light (meaning it's ready to be delivered to the table) I hoped that it was for me. The plate is hot so best not to touch it, but boy the cod melts in your mouth. You can dissemble it with your fork and it is too shiny and gorgeous to eat. It's true. and it just glides over your tongue with its flavour.. I forgot what was on the bottom it was some sort of a puree that went with the cod. But I tell you you must try the cod.. Dessert I was so convinced to try their traditional tart. Two little portuguese tart for $10. I am sure it is cheaper in Portugal. But they were cripsy on the outside and soft and eggy creamy inside. You definitely have to open you wallet far and wide here. All including the above the bill came to ~$160 for one person. But service was excellent and the food b y far one of the best meals I had. Hooray!"}
{"text":"high quality cuisine, excellent service, and a feel good atmosphere - I went twice over a 4-day vacation."}
{"text":"(see explanation of ratings below)  Not your daddy's Portuguese place.  This is upscale, hip and loud.  Love the leggy, lovely waitresses.  Try the sardines: large and tasty.  The risotto is to die for: served with a leg of duck confit.  About $90 per person, booze included, no dessert, excluding tip.  Chef spends a lot of time in the dining room.  About my ratings:  Only high-priced dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story.  But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.  Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):  1) fast food and \"fast-casual\", low-priced (no table service).  2) casual, mid-priced dining (table service, average entr√©e price: $10-$20).  3) fine, high-priced dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, average entr√©e priced at more than $20, can vary depending on the city).  High-priced dining can earn a max of five stars.  Mid-priced dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars."}
{"text":"Having worked in Portugal for a while, I was very pleased to find a Portuguese restaurant in Montreal.  As you might expect, the restaurant focuses on fresh fish, and my waiter had better-than-average knowledge of the different fish available the day I went.  I had a wild-caught pepper-crusted Tuna rare served with potatoes and vegetables. The cut of tuna was very good.  The serving of vegetables and potatoes was microscopic, which is a shame since I really like veges.  The price was not bad, and overall the meal was very good."}
{"text":"Great vibe, great food. Shrimp main course Portuguese style was fab. Portugese style oysters were great. Bar seat was very enjoyable to watch busy but efficient operations. Veroni is the best host."}
{"text":"This was my fifth time here. There is not much to be said - other than this place is absolutely INCREDIBLE.   Ambiance, decor, food, wine, service - all top notch PERIOD."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and service fine, but my evening was kind if ruined when the waiter scoffed at our 15% tip."}
{"text":"Authentic Portuguese cuisine. Bacalhau (cod fish) was as good as it comes. A bit pricey but worth it. Don't forget to ask for a bagaceira after desert."}
{"text":"Delicious food, had Arctic char and gal had grilled octopus.  Beautiful looking restaurant. Only drawback was server who spoke to much and attempted to much upselling."}
{"text":"I went there for a lunch. I had fish of the day and it was awesome. Service was impeccable. Had frilled calamari for appetizer and it's is so far the best grilled calamari I ever had. For the main I had full fish of the day and waiter cleaned it for me which was neat. Conclusion, will definitely return."}
{"text":"J'ai h√¢te de faire une autre visite"}
{"text":"Be sure to make reservations otherwise you'll be sadly disappointed that they're book solid. I've been to Montreal twice and both times made sure I booked in advance.   During the warmer seasons they open the restaurant windows so try to snag a seat there as it's the best seat in the house or venture further back into the restaurant for a more intimate setting.   This is hands down the best Portuguese food I've ever had. Their cod and risotto is to die for."}
{"text":"We walked in and ate at the bar after a day of shopping and walking around.  The staff was so pleasant and helpful!  I had the grilled octopus and that was a plentiful portion.  Hit the spot.  Simply prepared and they flavors just came through.  My friend had the pork and mussels was so tasty. I could eat this dish over and over again!  We loved the wine too so they let us buy some bottles to take with us."}
{"text":"We've been to Portugal several times and have eaten some wonderful meals there. Having said that, Ferreira Cafe takes Portuguese cuisine to another level...a more refined riff on traditional favorites. We had the sardine appetizer and found it flavorful and balanced. My entree, porcini crusted cod, was the definition of umami. My husband had the fresh Porgi which was deboned tableside by the waitstaff and served with an excellent warm couscous salad. The service was attentive without being overbearing. The bartender knew exactly how to mix a cocktail we had while in Porto and the wine and Port selection was extensive.   The atmosphere was relaxing and well designed. We found street parking even on a Monday evening but it took a few minutes. We highly recommend this dining experience."}
{"text":"We showed up 15 minutes early and the hosts would not find a seat for 82 year old patron with a cane! \"Why don't you go to next door if you need to sit down \" said the hostess. Worst ever treatment!  However, the food is amazing"}
{"text":"I travel to Montreal about once a month for work and this is my go to restaurant when I'm in the mood for good seafood. my favorite is the seafood bouillabaisse which is cooked to perfection. I wish I could provide more suggestions but every time I get the same thing. the atmosphere is good, lively and great place to people watch.  would recommend."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Ferrira's, and again it did not disappoint.  They are true to the Portuguese roots with a great selection  of seafood. I asked the waitress to help with the wine.  She suggested a Pinot Noir from Dao, Portugal and it was spectacular.  I will definitely try to find it at home.  We had the warm octopus salad as an appetizer.  It was grilled perfectly.  My wife says that is hard to do with bigger pieces of octopus.    She had the cod with a great reduction.  It melted in your mouth.  I had the grilled seafood platter with lobster, shrimp, calamari and fish.  All cooked very well.  The mashed potatoes with truffle oil gravy are awesome.    This place was quite expensive, but very good.  It is nice to splurge when you are on vacation!!"}
{"text":"This place came recommended, which probably sharpened the disappointment.  If it wasn't a $200 dinner for two, I'd rate it 3 stars, but at this price the bar gets raised.  The food: My mushroom risotto wasn't bad... it just tasted a bit watery, and had NO salt in it at all. Cooking 101 fail.  My SO had the '3 meat' combo, which was decent, but nothing to write home about. Maybe we should have gone for the salted cod, but something in me rebelled against paying that much for salted fish.  The service: They clearly hire their waitresses for the kind of body that can fit in a hot pink slinky dress, because that's about all they are good for.  Once our drinks were served, the waitress ignored us for close to an hour while we waited for the appetizer. At this point (yes, after close to an hour), a basket of not super fresh rolls was thrown on the table with a saucer of olive oil.  Service 101: if you make your customers wait for an hour, throw them a bone (I mean some warm rolls) to hold them over.   The ambiance: on the trendy side but unmemorable.  There were a lot of guys in suits at dinner on a Sunday night, which was a bit weird, as you just don't see people dressing up for dinner that much any more.  Verdict: overpriced and overrated."}
{"text":"Great food.  Excellent service.  I had the Portugese version of seafood paella, a tomato salad, and a deliciously light white wine."}
{"text":"Tuna with fries and Cod with Tomatoes and Onions - both fab. Great place. Visit everytime we are in Montreal. Love the decor!!!!"}
{"text":"Relaxing evening on the patio, the deserts were pretty great,  and the drinks too! Only thing is people smoking right beside you, coming out for a smoke, I know it has nothing to do with the restaurant itself, but when you're trying to put a delicious desert in your mouth and someone else's second hand smoke sneaks in with it, it's a bit of a turn off... But the place itself, no complaints! Friendly staff and reasonably quick service, made a nice evening!"}
{"text":"Great food great service. New York prices."}
{"text":"I loved it. We had no reservation but were able to be sat right away. Very good looking people here. The service was fantastic. The cornish hen dish was amazing. The menu seems to change depending on the season. If you are in Montreal. Def come here for dinner."}
{"text":"Hey kids, let me give you a warning before you even step foot in this place. You better be packing...cash that is. Cafe F. isn't cheap. If you're into Portuguese food, I hope you're also into hundred dolla bills y'all! That's enough gangster for today. OK, now that I've done my duty to warn friends, I'll tell you about some other important deets. This restaurant is pretty classy. Not only are the servers extremely attractive, but so is the decor and the menu. Loads of fish options, so if you're into seafood this is a good place to hit up. The wine list is also excellent, but again...pricey. I think I need a sugar daddy. Pronto. Oh, back to what's important. I ordered the cod, which I had heard everyone goes bonkers over. It was good, but I didn't die and go to heaven. Sorry to disappoint. Wait, maybe I'm the one disappointed here. Luckily, I was with great company and we ended up having quite a lush time here. Would I go back? Sure, but not until I'm a millionaire. So, I guess I'll see you again in 2025 Cafe Ferreira!"}
{"text":"We went here during the Grand Prix, so I think it was busier than usual. It was quite the 'scene' and was super busy, but that made the atmosphere fun and festive. Our waiter was excellent, great knowledge of the wine list, and was able to recommend wines for us. We got the grilled calamri and tartar for appetizers, the tartar was excellent, calamari was good but nothing to write home about. The best thing we got (shared - it's huge and big enough for two) is the seafood and rice, it is like a paella and had excellent flavor. It was maybe a little on the pricey side for good (not great) food but the atmosphere really made it."}
{"text":"We had a recommendation of this place from one local, while visiting Montreal.  The food is marvelous, the ambience is refined and cozy at the same time, service impeccable! You feel like a royal by the treatment received. Your glass of water is always full, you don't even need to ask for salt pepper or another glass of wine, cause the server was prompt right there to anything else we might need. I had the fish of the day, which tasted delicious right temperature perfect preparation. Great selection of Portuguese wines too.  I would return any other time I will visit Montreal and HIGHLY recommend to anyone that would like to experience a great time with fantastic food."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this restaurant, but never had the chance to go there until this week. A co-worker was in Montreal so we decided to try some Portuguese food for dinner... It was a good idea.  Situated on Peel in downtown Montreal, where there is plenty of restaurants, Ferreira Cafe stands out with his Portuguese specialty. In a beautiful venue, you'll be welcomed by a lovely waitress. We both took meat, and our meals were excellent: right cooking, and tasty vegetables with a good wine menu as some imported beers. My dessert, a cr√®me brul√©e, was also very good, and all the portions were just perfect: enough to have a good meal, but not too much like in so many restaurants!  Great ambiance, good service, and delicious food, what do you need more?"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic time and the positive reviews were completely accurate. Excellent service, great food, superb wine list. Particularly good was the grilled octopus, Portuguese oysters and black cod. So nice to see the owner engaging with restaurant guests. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience - sardines for appetizer , sea bass and black cod for entrees. Fish is flown in several times a week from Portugal. Preparation is excellent - lots of flavor but not overpowering.  Pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"The bouillabaisse was the star of the show. One of the best I'd ever had. I'd come again if I were in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Ferreira is one of the most reliably good restaurants in downtown Montreal. The fish is always fresh, perfectly prepared and wonderfully presented. The wait staff is experienced and provide consistently excellent service.  I've never been disappointed eating here. The only challenge is deciding what to order. When the waiter arrives at your table he will list all the fish available that day and it seems that ever time I hear something I think \"yes that sounds great I'll have that\" and then I hear the next thing on the list and I think the same thing. By the time we arrive at the end I have to ask the waiter to start again because there were so many things I wanted I can't remember the first ones that were mentioned.   Don't forget to save a little room for a pastel de nata, a Portuguese tart."}
{"text":"This is a top choice for dining in Montreal. I have eaten here many many times and the food is consistently good. A very nice place for a date or dinner with close friends/family. The black cod is very good and also had the seafood broth which was very nice. Service can be spotty here, though. Times between servings can get lengthy and once this place gets busy, flagging down your waiter is a problem. But a solid choice. Just come in and take your time and you will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was the only bad review I had in Montreal.  The good. Really nice place. Decor was modern and chic. Looks like the place you'd take a date or pre-game.  The bad. Served by a woman who was more interested in the table next to us. Took 5 mins to get a menu. Another 5 mins to get tap water (which she poured into our wine glasses as she was still watching the table next to us). We ordered and was told we just ordered too little. Fair enough I guess. So we said, let us rethink our order, give us a minute. For the next 15 mins we tried to call her over, but again she was still too busy with the other table... We were invisible.    Enough was enough, so we picked up our stuff and walked over to her and told her we were leaving. She paused and said she had already ordered our food... Wtf.    Finally a manager walked over and asked us if everything was ok . Our waitress came over... Now all smiles with the manager with us... And said she cancelled the order.   Great work. Useless. Ordered pizza. Shit way to finish your last night in Montreal."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Possibly the best green salad I ever had. Prices are a bit high but our waitress was very polite and we enjoyed our time here. If you are looking for a more upscale Portuguese cuisine, you can't get better in Montreal."}
{"text":"Came here hoping for a nice break from our usual French/American dining. The 10pm dinner menu (set for $24) looked very appealing. We arrived around 9:45p. Our waitress, after seating us down, did not bother coming back to our table until it was past 10pm. No water. Nothing. She kept serving all the other clients except us.   Another thing I disliked was the decor. Since it is a huge place, the modern decor felt very impersonal. The fuchsia light gave it a clubby feel. Plus the AC was on blast! At the end I couldn't wait to leave.   On to food. I ordered the grilled calamari, which was kind of bland. My black cod topped with very thin french fries was delicious. I didn't appreciate the black olive in the bottom. My fiance loved his organic chicken though it came with few veggies.  All and all, Ferreira did not meet the romantic & intimate vibe I was expecting. I would recommend to still try their signature dishes."}
{"text":"First of all, kudos to the kitchen. You turned out some great looking and delicious food.  On the other hand, the service seems to be hit or miss. For us, it was a total miss: a strike out looking, an air ball, a butt fumble, a breadbasket.  Speaking of breadbaskets, a dungeon master would bring bread out to prisoners with more civility than the staff at this cafe."}
{"text":"I went to Portugal 20 years ago.  I'm not sure where Ferreira gets their ideas from, but it blew doors off of any Portuguese food in Portugal.  The food was outstanding here. The service was stellar.  Our waiter was there every time we needed him and then some. He was pleasant, attentive, and informative.  The food was original and overly delicious.  The Salmon tartare was so nuanced in flavor.  The super jumbo shrimp was like how lobster should be, great flavor without the richness that makes me feel ill normally.  The black cod porcini was excellent. Definitely not your typical miso butterfish concoction. Everything was unique and so outrageously tasty.  I highly recommend the taster desert platter. So much thought and effort goes into their food. It was very affordable all things considered.  Our waiters name was Alex.  Boss man:  he deserves a raise!!!  Best waiter we have had in Canada!"}
{"text":"Not sure where the great reviews come from? Maybe tonight was an off, VERY off night? The restaurant itself was very nice, however the service and food left much to desire.  We started with the grilled calamari which was just ok cooked well but lack of flavour. For my entree I had the highly talked about black cod which is served on a potato pur√©e. My first bite of fish threw me off and realized I must have taken the potato by mistake... No it was the cod. It was complete mush. My husband and I are huge fish and seafood fans and both of us could not eat this fish. We would have complained had our waiter shown back up at all, we finally had to get up and to let someone else know we were not happy and would like the bill so we could leave. The apology was barely there and awkwardly dealt with, however the fish was not on our bill. We would not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Waouw, quelle belle place! Non seulement le staff est vraiment pro, accueillant, tout en √©tant d√©tendu, mais en plus la bouffe est  parfaite. Quand on rentre dans le restaurant, on se retrouve dans un espace tout en longueur. Des salons priv√©s sont disponibles pour des soupers d'affaire et c'est l√† que j'ai eu le plaisir d'exp√©rimenter les lieux. En nous dirigeant vers le fond on passe devant un √©talage de poissons frais, un peu comme au march√©. Cela donne clairement le ton. Ici on mange des produits frais, et la sp√©cialit√© c'est le poisson. En continuant on arrivera vers la cuisine, en mode totalement ouvert, les cuistots qui s'activent et donnent une attention sp√©ciale a chaque commande. Ici on n'a rien √† cach√© et cela traduit l'esprit du lieu. Le menu est portugais, il y a des plats du jour qui seront √©nonc√©s par les serveurs aussi et quelques options carnivores et v√©g√©tariennes. Tout fait envie! J'ai choisi une demi douzaine d'hu√Ætres en entr√©e, pr√©sentation tres jolie avec un assaisonnement pr√©sent√© en mignonnette sur le cot√©. J'ai ensuite choisi une dorade royale qui √©tait un des plats du jour. Les poissons sont propos√©s a paratger pour les grands mod√®les ou en portion individuelle. Ils sont cuits entiers et le serveur vous propose de les pr√©parer a la table pour retirer les arr√™tes. J'ai choisi de garder le miens entier et me d√©brouiller seule. Un poisson bien cuit est g√©n√©ralement facile a pr√©parer et c'√©tait clairement le cas. Grill√© et sans chichi, il venait accompagn√© d'un petit m√©lange de l√©gumes coup√©s fins et assaisonn√©s, un peu comme un chutney tr√®s bon et ideal avec la chair du poisson. L'accompagnement est pr√©sent√© dans une autre assiette et se composait de l√©gumes vari√©s dont les couleurs et les textures faisaient en soin un plat go√ªteux et agr√©able aux yeux. Je n'ai pas pu tout finir, les portions √©taient bien suffisantes! Quel regal pour les papilles et pour les yeux. Un vrai sens du detail, un √©quilibre des saveurs. Le vin servi avec √©tait √©galement parfait. En dessert une cr√®me br√ªl√©e au citron avec un sorbet... rien de la traditionnelle cr√®me, c'√©tait beaucoup plus fin et tr√®s original. Tous les convives int eu beaucoup de plaisir a manger et nous avons pass√© de longs moments √† discuter nos assiettes, √©pat√©s par la qualit√© de chaque plat. J'y reviendrai pour un souper entre copines, en couple mais pas avec des enfants. Le lieu peut √™tre un peu bruyant et les plats peuvent √™tre dispendieux donc pour des palais avertis et amateurs de bonne chair!"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food first hand, as I didn't dine there (but my parents reported it was delicious and the service was great); I did speak with Charlotte to make some arrangements for my parents meal, and she was fantastic.  The Ferreira team did exactly as I asked, and followed up with me afterwards as promised. I love anywhere with pleasant, helpful staff and great customer service (plus pictures of the food looked amazing) - will definitely visit if ever in Montreal. Thank you, Charlotte!"}
{"text":"If you like cod both of the entrees are excellent. My wife had the 'Salted Cod Braz style' and I had the 'Porcini Crusted Roasted Black Cod, Port reduction'.   I would also recommend the 'Fleur de sel roasted sardines filets on \"brioche\"' as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Came here with my partner to have dinner. He got the Quail stuffed with sweet bread served with foie gras on toast; while I had the Duck confit on Risotto. The duck confit was tender and nicely done. However, I was very disappointed with the Risotto. It was very salty and also not done. My partner's quail was better in my opinion. The foie gras was probably my favourite though. Rich and great on the bread. The atmosphere of the restaurant is dim and cozy. Next time I would try more of their seafood just to see if there's a difference."}
{"text":"Good drinks and soups/appetizers but small portions and very slow service.  Great decor music and lighting make for nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's a good, but it's not good enough for me to come back though.  But, i only had an appetizer and an entree there, i might not be the judge to say that.  This place seems to have a lot of loyal fans, it was packed on a Monday evening, and the bar tender seems to know a lot of customers.    i started with the sample platter that come with sausage, sardine, calamari, and quail.  it's good, but not super tasty.  For entree, i had roasted pork with clams.  it's not bad.  The portion is huge!!"}
{"text":"Very good fresh Portuguese food with an amazing and polite staff, always a good stop for lunch or even dinner. All around one of the best places to eat in Montreal. A must"}
{"text":"Love this place Try the late night menu It's many dishes from regular menu but half the price Add a lobster when in season"}
{"text":"I came in on a Sunday (with a reservation) during Grand Prix weekend not knowing more than a few phrases in French, and was greeted with friendly faces in red dresses who happily showed me to my seat and offered recommendations upon request.  The porcini-crusted cod is as wonderful as others say it is, but perhaps even more fantastic was the octopus \"salad\" that had no greens, but hummus, red onions, shallots and capers instead.  At the end of the night, it was a fig cake & sweet potato ice cream that was so delicious, I just had to order a coffee to sip while I soaked up the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here without a reservation and they were able to seat us at the bar.  The dishes were great!  Service was also REALLY great.  We had the sardines as an appetizer which IMO was just okay.   It was good but something was off.  They were a little too salty.  I ordered the seafood bouillabaisse and it was AMAZING.  My husband had the seafood casserole which was like a cross between a paella and a bouillabaisse.  It was really REALLY good.  Filled with seafood and the rice was cooked just to the perfect texture.    Food portions were perfect - not too much, not too little.  Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Great Portuguese food with friendly service.  Very pricey.  I enjoyed all the apps and entrees I tried here.  The dessert sampler is a must try if you like dessert.  Best Portuguese food I have had outside of Portugal.  Entree sizes were surprisingly large here compared to other places I have been to in Canada and Montreal."}
{"text":"I liked the place a lot. WE arrived pretty late (at 9:30pm) and the place was still quite full. The food came with a very nice presentation and was very tasty. I got the grilled octopus and the fish of the day that was corvina. Very well cooked and with nice flavors. I would go back if I'm in town again"}
{"text":"Excellent food and attentive service. I had the black cod and my husband the lamb stew, which he loved and I'll try next time."}
{"text":"Might have been the best meal I've had in Montreal (or perhaps that would be Toque). The octopus first course with the smoky eggplant puree was exquisitely prepared and presented, with a crispy outside and perfectly delicate texture. Also, the generous portion makes it perfect to share. My husband had the grouper prepared in a Portuguese style (tomatoes and other vegetables and small white potatoes), and I had two types of salt cod and both dishes were the kind of complex and distinct flavors that you taste every morsel, but the dishes also work together as a whole. Who knew what mint could do! The service was attentive, well-informed and professional. And in a charming coincidence, the couple at the next table were also out-of-towners....from our neighborhood! So we became acquainted and had a lively conversation. We will most definitely visit Ferreira again."}
{"text":"I went to Ferreira for the first time this past summer and both myself and my dinner guests loved the food. What we didn't love, was the lousy service - so when I went back last night, I was hopeful for a better experience. Boy, was I wrong. While the food was good, the service was worse than the first time I went. The manager barely acknowledged us when we arrived, and 'friendly' isn't how I would describe him. He came off as a little arrogant and indifferent. After taking us to our table and asking us if we wanted to check our coats, he left (while our coats sat on a neighbouring table) and never came back. After waiting 10-15 minutes for some kind of acknowledgement, someone finally came by to ask if we wanted to order ; they didn't offer us water, ask if we wanted drinks or even tell us what the daily specials were, if any. Seriously? We told the waiter we'd like a drink which took another 10 minutes to arrive. We then were told that someone new would wait our table. It took at least 20-30 minutes before we were able to order our dishes - and we had to call the girl over twice AND ask for the specials/tell her we were hungry. All the while, there were about 6-7 waiters/waitresses hanging around the bar chatting -some of them looked over once in a while and of course, completely ignored us. My friend and I did notice, however, that the wait staff (including our bad waitress) hovered around the other tables - which lead us to believe that because we LOOK young, the wait staff didn't deem us 'worthy' of their service. Part of the dining out experience is the service - Ferreira failed twice, on this count, and I won't be going back regardless of how good the food might be. For $85, I expect timely service with a smile regardless of how young or old I look - and I shouldn't have to walk around with an open wallet to demonstrate that I can afford to eat there."}
{"text":"incredible meal.. beyond great service! awesome atmosphere... accommodating to vegetarians and meat eaters alike.  highly recommend"}
{"text":"Previously one of my favourite spots in Montreal but on my last visit a few weeks ago seems to have dropped a few notches.  It's a beautiful restaurant and is still popular, being nearly full on a Monday night.  The food seems to have dropped a notch since I was here last.  We started with some very fresh but rather tasteless calamari.  I had a green salad, again, quality ingredients but rather lacklustre dressing.  I had lamb as my main, same problem, a very nice cut and well cooked but quite bland in presentation and flavour.  Nothing really wrong with any of the food, but for the price point really would have expected a little more \"wow\" factor and creativity.  Service was friendly but a bit spotty.  Early in the evening was fine but as the restaurant got busy we had to chase our server for coffee and the bill."}
{"text":"Always good. Expensive, but definitely worth it. Excellent selection of wine, perfect place for a date or celebrate a mariage anniversary."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food.  The black cod is amazing and the octopus was the best I have ever had.  Firm but tender and delicately balanced with some nice acidity.  The sardine appetizer was also delicious.    Everything we ordered was perfectly executed.  With that comes fairly hefty pricing.  Yelp has this place listed as $$$ but I definitely feel it is a $$$$ kind of place.  The black cod entr√©e was $39.  And unless you like salt cod (which I am sure is great here, but I am not a huge fan in general), most of the entr√©es are in the mid-to-high $30's.  That being said, they could charge twice as much and it would be worth it.  Truly an excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"There are so many restaurants to choose from in this city!!  So, where do you turn to if you aren't sure where to go....Yelp of course!  The recommendations were stellar and we were not steered wrong!  Travel day to Montreal for work...and its my birthday away from home, but I'm happy to be with great friends.  We make the trek up Rue Peel, luggage in tow - all up hill mind you.  \"Should only be about 4 blocks, oh ok only 2 more blocks, well it should be up this block.  Oye, worn out from our hike our hunger was almost outta control.  We arrived and the hostess gladly handled our bags by putting them in coat check, swiftly got us seated and immediately we were asked about our beverage to start the evening.  Not being familiar with their wine selection the sommelier Victor offered up a taste of a wonderful red Quinta Do Crasto '06.  History: Quinta do Crasto revolutionized Douro winemaking. From a traditional blend of touriga nacional, tinta roriz, touriga franca and the hearty tinta barroca comes a vibrant red with perfect cherry fruit, embellished with caraway, cedar, leather and fennel notes. Medium weight and juicy, with excellent length. Drink now or age five years.  We drank it now and it was very good!!  The starter was 4 roasted sardines topped with fleur de sel seated on an olive tapenade and served with toasted bread.  The sardine melted in your mouth, the salt and olive tapenade gave balance and seasoning and the bread provided the host for this tasty treat.  My entree was the Black Cod accompanied by a seafood risotto.  Ok, I have never had such a well prepared dish that made me want to order seconds, thirds and a doggy bag!  The fish was cooked to perfection and was topped with a nice parsley garlic puree  The risotto was creamy with ample clams and mussels throughout.   My friends had Cataplana fish and seafood bouillabaisse and seared tuna, smashed potatoes with foie gras --- considering there was no noise except for the constant humm of 3 happy diners I was fully confident their dishes were as good as mine.  Thankfully or regrettably there was a second round of bread brought to the table so we all were able to soak up our respective sauces and broth...needless to say no bread remained.  Dessert, like we needed it, included a coconut milk tapioca with pineapple marmalade (sooo smooth and creamy) and an order of Portugese vanilla tarts served with a scoop of the most intense coffee ice cream I've had.  This was a fabulous meal, outstanding service and a go to restaurant for me whenever I come back into the city!  Thank you Victor for the introduction to a wonderful wine selection!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to come and try this place because Portuguese food done right is stellar and reminds me of my grandmother's cooking.   The vibe of the place is definitely more upscale, but without the snobby clientele and staff. The staff was friendly and attentive throughout, providing amazing customer service.   For appetizers we got the grilled calamari - which had a squid ink sauce. I had never eaten that before but it's now something I'll definitely be adding to my watch-out list. The flavour was just so unique and went perfectly with the fish. We also got the bed of sardines and they were grilled to perfection, and the bread that they came on amazingly moist and crunchy.   For my main I got the seafood casserole on a bed of rice. IT WAS AMAZING!! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND. PLEASE GET IT. It had those quintessential Portuguese flavours and their seafood was of the highest quality. The scallops were large, tender and flavourful and the lobster meat as well as shrimp were taken out of their shell, which made it perfect to just eat right away instead of it being slightly messy. The other thing that was great and stood out was that the dish came in its own little cast-iron pot and the staff puts it onto your plate for you, something that doesn't happen at most restaurants, but something that was a nice touch and definitely appreciated.   After being insanely stuffed my sister convinced me to get dessert. We ended up getting the Nates which remind me of my childhood, being one of my favourite Portuguese desserts. When they arrived they were warm, as if freshly baked and they came with a side of rice pudding ice cream. My sister got a cappuccino and she said it was amazing, smooth and creamy.   I love this place. I could not recommend it more. I told my boyfriend (who did not come on the trip) all about it and how next time we're in Montreal we must come back to this place."}
{"text":"Servers and managers everywhere:  pay attention.  I've been on a long cold streak on making reasonable, but non-standard, requests and having them turned down.  After a good meal that I was prepared to rate a solid 4 stars, my companions and I ordered glasses of tawny port.  There were three available by the glass:  a 20-y/o Graham's, a 10-y/o Warre's, and an Offley Colheita (1995).  We ordered the latter, and the server returned with the 20-year Graham's, explaining that they were out of the one we ordered.  In fairness, I should mention that the Graham's was more $$$ on the menu than the Offley Colheita, and I think they were going to give it to us for the lower price.  But we really wanted, at a Portuguese restaurant, something we don't see all over the place -- and that meant not Graham's and not Warre's.  And we wanted a tawny, not a vintage.  So we asked whether they might possibly be able to find some other bottle that they wouldn't mind opening up and giving us three glasses of.  The server said \"let me check with my sommelier,\" and eventually came back with a different Colheita.  And it was fantastic.  And that's their fifth star, easily.  Why does everywhere else have so much trouble with this?  I'm mortified at how small we wound up tipping -- with Canadians at a restaurant in Canada, maybe they're furious with their dumb American companion for giving a little bit more (can I get a straight answer on what is normal in Montreal these days please?) -- especially since the service was impeccable even before that, and since we didn't order very much.    So the food?  Yeah, it was good, too, probably 4 stars.  Black cod?  Melts in your mouth -- and a bigger piece than you get in many places (way more than lemeac, for example).  Seafood rice dish?  The shellfish was amazing looking, and tons of it, but I tried the rice, and it was pretty boring.   But a nice atmosphere, if you don't mind kinda loud music, an open kitchen that looked remarkably ordered and under control, no chaos at all, so probably very consistent with what they put out.  And the service was the best I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"I was hoping for a spot with a Portuguese feel, however apart for one really cute and colorful wall of china and clay, the place was much more loungy than Portuguese.  Ferreira has a feel that's desperately being phased out by most major cities, including club music pumping through the speakers and the whole place illuminated and decorated in lounge type decor.  They may also have an unspoken agenda of getting people to wear least amount of clothes because it was very stealthy and hot inside.  After sitting down, I still had high hopes for the food, however, like my first step inside, my first bite of the crudo dispersed these.  It was completely off balance and really needed acidity and seasoning.  The one saving grace of the meal was the bouillabaisse.  The fish and seafood were cooked well and the broth was seasoned nicely.  It may be a place for some but on my next trip to Monrteal I'll be passing on dinner at Ferreira's."}
{"text":"Impeccable seafood cooking, warm/friendly service.  Would return for a special occasion without hesitation.  Call for reservations.  Ways to improve:  - a place to wait for your table (when the bar is full) or an alternative option to standing in the doorway such as a callback. - offer tap water in the initial water up-sell of \"still or sparkling?\" - more sound dampening on ceiling.  At full swing, it's moderately loud.  Things that rocked: - very friendly, helpful, patient staff.  Server offered to separate bill without us asking and also performing calculations to split shared dishes/wine. - service of the staff once you're seated are top notch, water refilled constantly, wine glasses refilled promptly - perfectly cooked black cod.  Layer after layer of succulent cod not in the slightest bit overcooked and yet not raw either.  Cook's in kitchen have PhD's in time/temperature of protein cooking. - impressive rabbit stew (you get the entire pan, which is plated for you at the table) - beautifully presented half lobster - insulated chilled wine sacks for white wine - impressive port selection - proper creme brul√©e (sheet of caramelized sugar you need to crack) - chocolate fondant cake like a lake of choco-awesomeness  Again, very happy about the meal and service.  Its popularity is well deserved."}

{"text":"went here today after two people who live in montreal recommended. this is the first place we hit up on our trip. asked mirelle at the w hotel concierge for a RSVP and they squeezed us in at 2 pm. it was packed - mostly a business crowd. we ended up staying for 2 hours and took our time with lunch. hostess was very nice and she seated us right next to the window. server was attentive, however, it did take him some time to fill my water glass throughout lunch. he had no qualms about speaking in english either - thank goodness. seemed like definitely the place to be for lunch. the hubs ordered the soup of the day (vegetable soup) and the the tomato/parmasean salad. he enjoyed both very much. he said the soup had a kick to it. i ordered the appetizer of the day - this potato salad proscuitto w/ vinaigrette thingy. sorry, that's what i remember. there is something about the tomatoes here in montreal, they are so fresh and tasty. for the entree, i got the fish bouillabaisse and that was perfect for a gloomy afternoon. not too heavy or creamy - just the way i like it. the portion was very generous. definitely need to enjoy seafood to come here...poor hubs since he is not a seafood eater. almost everything on the menu is fish something. we finished off lunch with the vanilla creme br√ªl√©e and coffee. fyi, they don't serve decaf (or ice tea or lemonade). for the both of us, it was only $60 before tip - completely reasonable for a nice lunch. remember there are two doors to the restaurant. you want the first door, the second takes you upstairs for a private event space i think. would love to come back to try the other items on the menu. rue peel is right off of the main shopping street - rue st. catherine. about 15-20 min walk from the montreal."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled on this small restaurant downtown because of the jam packed terrace. Once I saw black cod on the menu, I immediately decided this was our dinner for the evening. The inside is pretty small but great ambience and cozy feel. We sat across from the open kitchen- which I love seeing! We were greeted by a super friendly and patient server. We ordered the octopus appetizer which we both enjoyed. The black cod was ok- a bit bland,  but I really loved their Portuguese salsa I ordered on the side! My husband ordered the seafood bouillabaisse with a lobster mixed in. He was disappointed with the small quantity of the lobster but overall he liked his dish. Not a bad place to try out for an evening of splurging if only for the ambience and great service."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere and great food. Oysters were wonderful. Recommended wine paired very well with the food. Get a table by the front and enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"So I've always passed by this restaurant on my way to the gym and I've wanted to try it. I like my high end restaurants, this is no secret...and last night I've finally got to go! Yay!  Good : My side salad and the salmon was really well cooked. Decor is nice, the plating was excellent.   Bad : I'll start off with a really awkward seating arrangement. I had to squeeze through a tight space of two other tables to get to my seat by the wall. Fine, I can put up with that. Bread took 20 minutes to arrive. Okay, let me just carb up now because if it takes that long to get bread, I can't imagine how long the appetizers will take. When my sardines appetizer arrived, it came with a weird jelly/fish paste thing on the bottom that looked like smoke salmon. I took a big scoop of that deceitful smoke salmon jelly looking thing (in my defense, I thought it was smoked salmon) and it was probably one of the worst decisions of my life (besides art school). I've ordered the Churrasco style cornish hen as my main course...and quite frankly, it was really dried. Maybe I came in with really high expectations, but I've had better chicken at Romado's for half that price.   Bottom line : Water will cost you $5 and it won't come in a Fiji bottle either. Not exactly a good experience, not quite the best Portugese food, not likely returning either."}

{"text":"first night in montreal and wow - what a meal...for starters we ordered grilled octopus, exquisite,   i opted for salad (mixed greens with lemon dressing - perfect!) and appetizer (tiger shrimp w/ginger aioli) as my main course. they brought it out on one plate which was very thoughtful.  my husband ordered the seafood rice dish (like a paella) and he thoroughly enjoyed the generous portion of mussels, 'meaty' lobster and scallops...  we also ordered a side of mushrooms and were pleasantly surprised that this was a mix of hearty mushrooms, (not the typical button that are 'dressed up').  i'd pass on the molten cake, i've had better. might've given this place 5 stars if we skipped dessert..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Great food.  Good wine selection.  Grilled calamari is amazing and how it should be done.  Reminded me of the way it's prepared in the Mediterranean.  Staff was amazing too."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a great atmosphere and an even better staff, this place was located on cool strip close to our hotel, outdoor seating was available, beautiful bar and an area to sit and watch the chefs cook up our dinner. This is must go to when in downtown Montreal. We had the grilled seafood platter and the black cod both were delicious."}
{"text":"Seriously tempted to only give 2 stars here.  The food was good but not great.  And for the price?  I expected a lot more finesse than I experienced.  Started with the soupl which was nice and hot for a cold night.  Good flavor but nothing extraordinary.  Then ordered the cod crusted with corn bread.  Again good but not extraordinary.  I found myself hunting for a little more signature flavor in the sauce, in the vegetables, in anything.  Oh and the potatoes were on the border of undercooked - inedible.  What bothered me most was the extreme preocupation of the serving staff to talk with each other.  Okay maybe I should give them the benefit of the doubt that they were discussing work  Still found it distracting.  Amusing that during my 1 hour in the restaurant the music changed 4 times.  I know, i watched the staff changing it out.  Looks like a turf war as to what music should be played during dinner.  Overall wished that I had chosen to go to anywhere a little off the beaten path where I could have had a better meal for less $$$.  But then, fool was I to expect really good food for a reasonable price on Peel."}
{"text":"The taste of everything was wonderful.  We had fried calamari, tomatoe and cheese salads, grouper, and garlic shrimp.  While it all tasted great, the main courses of garlic shrimp only had 3 shrimp for $46.  That's quite excessive.  The other issue was the service.  The waitress did not get the drink order correct and the food took too long to come out."}

Entr√©e √† partager, n¬∞1 : assiette de charcuterie. Bon, je viens de comprendre pourquoi le jambon Pata Negra co√ªte si cher √† l'achat... c'est un REGAL ! Les autres charcuteries (de m√©moire un saucisson et une terrine) √©taient tout aussi bon, l'ensemble √©tait parfait et il y en a bien assez pour partager √† 2 et se mettre doucement en app√©tit. Entr√©e √† partager, n¬∞2 : huitres gratin√©es. J'avais un vague souvenir d'huitres gratin√©es faites par une amie... bah l√† j'ai un souvenir bien net d'une entr√©e absolument exquise !

{"text":"Amazing! Highly recommend  I usually don't eat fish but the waiter recommended I try the cod, I did not regret it. I had forgotten fish could taste this good, worth the price. They also have a good wine selection. The ambiance is very nice, it's calm, you can enjoy your meal peacefully.  (I want on a weekday, it might be different on the weekend)"}

{"text":"My husband and I have visited montreal together twice now and both times we've eaten at ferreira cafe.  The first time we went, my husband ordered their signature black cod and I ordered a tuna entree.  Needless to say, his cod trumped my tuna (I don't remember the tuna that well now - it was lacking something I guess).  The cod was so flavorful and moist.  A few years later, when we visited ferreira cafe again, my husband ordered the cod again and I ordered the seafood bouillabaisse (my previous tuna dish was no longer on the menu - not surprising).  The cod was again delicious but my seafood bouillabaisse was amazing! This was a classic seafood dish done right.  The ingredients were fresh and the medley of fish, shellfish, vegetables and broth were sublime.  The seafood was tender and the vegetables were cooked perfectly.  The broth was the best part.  It was rich in taste and complemented the ingredients so well. It's been a few months since I had that dish and I can still taste it.  The service was great both times. The sommelier picked a nice crisp white to go with both our dishes (I unfortunately can't remember the name).  The hostess and the wait staff were attentive and nice.  The ambiance provides low lighting for a romantic dinner.  The space isn't too big so feels more intimate, but it can get a little too close for comfort when it's a friday or saturday night - their busiest nights - and you're almost sitting with the couple at the next table.  But overall we love ferreira cafe. We'll definitely visit again on our next trip."}
{"text":"In town for a conference and, after a long day in sessions, an enjoyable meal is a must. And with so many great options to choose from in Montreal, I am very pleased we decided on this spot! The service was excellent, the food was delightful, and, well, the service was excellent! While predominantly focused on seafood, the vegetarian risotto was amazing and my friend definitely enjoyed her grilled fish - which came out whole (head and all) and our lovely waitress  proceeded to expertly debone and prepare it at the table (see pic for reference). I rarely eat fish and even I enjoyed my bite! Would definitely recommend this spot, especially for seafood lovers."}
{"text":"Flew to Montreal for a few days from NYC. After doing some local research I found this place.  Anyone coming to Montreal needs to come here. Excellent food and staff and I really enjoyed everything about my experience. Ingrid and Marilyn were behind the bar where I ate by myself and couldn't have been better from start to finish. They helped me navigate everything and I enjoyed it all. Grilled octopus then black cod, and finished with a pear caramel cake that was awesome. Dont know when I will be back to Montreal, but when I do, i will be back here.."}
{"text":"The fish was fresh fresh fresh, and delicious. Presentation was really nice. Had the signature black cod, salmon, lamb, grilled halibut, grilled tuna, and Portuguese style grouper. All were absolutely delish. Also had the sardines and the seafood platter. Would definitely go back there, even tomorrow! Service was perfect, too. plenty of time given. Didn't have dessert, nor any wine."}
{"text":"Simply amazing service, food and ambiance. For starters I had a tuna tartare that was just perfect and had a perfect balance of seasoning. Then I enjoyed a lobster risotto that was cooked perfectly with mouth watering ingredients and a full lobster. Capped it off with. Portuguese Douro 2013 red. Simply enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Tous les plats sont parfaits, vin d√©licat et un service tr√®s agr√©able. De grands professionnels, un bel endroit en toute occasion."}
{"text":"2 words - Black Cod - enter, sit, order it and be prepared to be blown away.  That's all I am going to say besides everything else is excellent; menu, service, and decor."}
{"text":"Ok, I might take back all of my reviews  down one star from the past restaurants I visited in Montreal because this one was the best! Our waiter Laurent was full of knowledge and was very pleasant to speak with And helped us pick the best every step of the way. From the beginning to the end the food was amazing. Even the olive oil was to die for. We ordered a bottle of Vhino Verde by Anselmo Mendes. Very smooth and not too much on the sparkling side. For food we ordered the grilled calamari ( must have!) and entree the black cod and the steak. The black cod was a hit! If you come here you must have this dish. For Dessert we had the chocolate moose! We also got to try a Dessert wine named Muscatel. Very good as well not as sweet as a port. Don't miss out on this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"http://www.ferreiracafe.com/EN/  If you are lucky enough to score a seat at the bar for lunch, you are in for a treat. I believe that Jackie (i hope i remembered her name right!)should be complimented on her mixology skills that are a stellar as her personality. It was a show just watching her work the regular crowd as well as the few tourists who were privileged enough to be seated at her bar.   I tried to download their menu so I could tell you exactly what I sampled  - it was lunch and I wanted to try a few things before having to trek home to Chicago. I remember a seared tuna bite and salad and oysters and wine. I'll update when my computer permits.   The restaurant was packed (weekday) with suits and still managed an exciting buzz that was infectious. Lunch was a celebration of life and a reminder to lift a glass, eat good food and always trust another chef's referral for lunch.   I have to rank this as spendy but worth every penny!  merci Chef Dave!"}
{"text":"good place to take a date - professional service, fancy decor, tasty, great $24 fixed menu after 10pm (a bit late!) but pricey, not a super appealing selection of food. mainly seafood, large wine selection. ordered the fish soup (tomato-based - big bowl but small portion) and cod appetizer (beautiful presentation, fresh fish, small portion), which were OK but not memorable. at least $30 per person food only, nice open kitchen"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and decor. Fancy looking fancy expensive but not tasty. For the interior looks I would give 5*, but you don't give stars just for that.   Food is very very below the average. Tried lots of things there hoping for the better flavor, but I'm disappointed. There are missing the absolute Portuguese classic flavors. The seafood for two is ridiculously over priced - 1. Such small portion (cold & hot)  and the hot version which you'd expect would have some interestig flavor - shockingly it is not tasty at all. 2. Fried calmari starter is the poorest quality choice as well.  3. And sizes are super duper tiny, not only in options for two.   I'm a Seafood/Portugese Cuisine lover so the fact that they lack on at least one solid  traditional butter-garlic tasty seafood is very disappointing.   Better to not go there and fly to Lisbon instead, that's how expensive and low value it is.   Feeling bad also for the absolutely beautiful and sweet waitresses , for they are wasting their lives there, they should move to Hollywood or get into serious modeling or acting carrier.   Service was great.  That is the ONLY plus there can be.   Disappointed with the tasteless and unlike the Portuguese food, and would not want it for free if someone wanted to offer it to me.   I do not recommend this absolutely overpriced place."}
{"text":"Absolute perfection!  My fiance took me here for my birthday Sept 2012. I loved everything about this place. The service was classy and the food was served steaming hot without too long of a wait. The dishes were phenomenal! The red wines by the glass also paired well with the dishes.  We ordered: Orzo and duck (the flavors in this dish are so rich I can't begin to describe them) Fish of the day (fiance ordered this, he basically refused to share because he loved it so much but I remember having a bite and it was cooked to perfection)  ** One small complaint was that they gave us our leftovers in some fancy bag that had to be held with 2 hands. If you held it by the handle (which I ended up doing) it leaked."}
{"text":"Excellent food with generous portions. Vibe is nice, but not on the trendy side and slightly older crowd. Hot servers who were not the most attentive."}
{"text":"Was able to get a table without a reservation. very lucky.  Although seated in the back of the restaurant we were comfortable, and the service was great.  Had the Porcini crusted roasted black cod, which our waiter said was their signature dish...delicious, gives the black cod at Nobu a real test.  Started with their soft shell crab entree. delightful and finished with vanilla tarts with caramel ice cream...a 5 star dessert.  Yes, this cafe could be the best Portuguese restaurant outside of Portugal!"}
{"text":"Has to be the best meal I've ever eaten in Montreal. What a nice surprise from a last-minute decision on a Friday night!  I am more used to New World wines, and found the wine list challenging to interpret. Our waiter didn't seem too fussed about explaining some options. Service in general was a little reserved, but this could well have been because we were speaking English to a very francophone staff.  We started with the charcuterie board, which was notable for a really delicious duck terrine. Pleasantly, the capers and olives were quite good quality on their own, not just space fillers.   I had the porcini-encrusted black cod, and kind of felt like crying when it was gone. This was some of the best fish I've ever eaten. Beautifully cooked, silky and rich and light all at once. The mashed potatoes and mushrooms on the side were also outstanding. The few bites I had of the duck confit and mushroom risotto were gorgeous, and I say that as a firm risotto avoider.  This was not a cheap meal, but it was worth every cent. Unlike some pricey meals, which are made up of a few bites on a series of plates, I was honestly too full for dessert by the end of the evening (which I was disappointed about, because the desserts looked great).  Quick recommendation: visit the women's bathroom and use the homemade olive oil scrub. Such a random and luxurious offering!  My one tiny complaint is a sexist vibe I got from a waiter who came to refill my wine glass and said mine must be empty while my boyfriend's was full because I'd been \"talking away.\" An annoying comment at any time, but especially grating when you're at a nice restaurant and feel it's not the place to make a scene."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was a little snooty.  I mean, we are stupid Americans, but part of being in Montreal is that they also speak English.  It was a little bit of a turn off when the wait staff gave a little attitude when we didn't speak French.    On the food side, my stomach was quite satisfied with the seafood stew. They presented it in a such a way that they did the plating tableside.  I was so hungry that I just wanted them to give me the freaking pot, but it made for a cool video."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for good bouillabaisse, and as I walked past Ferreira's at noon, I noticed it on their menu and made arrangements to take my wife there for dinner.  The restaurant is what I would call \"fancy\", so it's not really the type of place you'd take children to, and it's priced on the higher end, and not really the type of place you'd go to in blue jeans.  The wine list seemed a little pricy for the quality but it's what you'd expect from this type of restaurant.  For starters I ordered the grilled calamari, which was the star of the evening. The calamari was prepared so tenderly that it tasted like lobster, and was presented beautifully (picture attached). For my main course I ordered the bouillabaisse. The bouillabaisse was good, but lacked depth of flavor. It wasn't bad, but I expected more after having such an exceptional appetizer.  My wife ordered a steak (a filet). There was no option to order a petite stake (under half a pound), so she went with the big one. The steak was well aged and was tender and tasty (one big steak), with accompanied veggies.  The service was excellent.  All in all, it was a good meal, we tipped the server well, but it didn't rate a return visit."}
{"text":"So glad a local contact recommended Ferreira Cafe to us, an amazing first night in Montreal meal!  Ambience is slightly upscale but not formal or stuffy. Broken plate wall is a great touch. Aperitif from the host for a slight wait in our reservation was a class act.  For appetizers we had the grilled sardines and the seared Tuna. Both were excellent. The sardines were prepared very classic and simple with olive oil, salt capers and oregano grilled with a slight char, perfection!  The tuna was seared with a Peppercorn crust, raw center and was perfect.  For my entree it had to be the black cod. The cod was light, tasted like a sweet buttery almost dessert like dish and was placed atop potato pur√©e. While eating it was sometimes difficult to tell where the cod finished and the potato started. A wonderful dish finished in a wine reduction with porcini mushrooms. I would say this is a must order dish.  My favorite meal in Montreal for sure and based on the crowds I saw there there the next afternoon while strolling by, I say it's a favorite for many locals!"}
{"text":"Service was below mediocre for this caliber of restaurant.  We were sat right next to a party, and ordered exactly the same time, but waited about 30 minutes past their entrees being dropped for ours.  I had the meat trio and my wife had the mushroom risotto.  The meats were well seasoned, but the churico was overcooked and hard like a rock.  The risotto was a bit watery and needed salt badly.  Had to request salt since they dont keep it on the table.  The waitress must have been hired for her ability to wear a miniskirt, because she was very absent during our over 2hr long meal at this place.  The best thing here that we had was the not-so-generous portion of calamari.  It was flash fried to perfection and had the best breading I've had in a while.  Giving two stars for the extremely slow service, and the underwhelming food.  If I'm going to put down $100 per person for dinner, it should be above average in every way.  This place fell way short of average."}
{"text":"Love the romantic ambience of this seafood-centric Portugese restaurant.   Complimentary bread - yum with olive oil   Started off with grilled seafood for 2 (shared amongst 4 people) - large prawn, lobster, scallop, octopus in delicious garlic parsley sauce. Everything is so fresh, large portion and cooked perfectly.   Bouilliabaisse  - seafood soup, actually not much soup, but again the seafood was good.   Seafood Rice - love this the most, the flavors (tomato, saffron??) can't find anywhere else. Rice is a bit hard for my personal taste but love the sauce and the meaty seafood.   For dessert we had warm fig cake with sweet potato icecream. The cake reminds me of sticky toffee pudding, not too sweet. No sweet potato taste in the icecream, but just as delicious with a cinnamon flavor. I liked this more than the creme brulee."}
{"text":"A classic, almost old world ambience permeates this downtown restaurant, which is nicely set off by youthful, enthusiastic staff.  Most of the diners seem to be well-dressed foodies of a certain age, but there were families too.  I can see this place being a \"go-to\" for locals, as they offer lots of meat dishes in addition to their fish and Portuguese specialties. Something for almost everyone.  Eating alone, I had a great view of the restaurant from my secluded corner. Service is excellent, as is the food, though I would say portions are small for the price.  I started with 6 oysters from the Madeleine Islands, which were creamy and perfectly briny, well joined with a glass of Albari√±o.  For my main course, I was in a pickle, as the fresh fish selections all sounded irresistible , but I went ahead with my initial choice, the seafood and rice stew, with added lobster. This is a delectable dish and I ate every morsel. There's a bit of piquancy that really adds to the dish but it's not too spicy to overwhelm other flavors, or put you off. The Shrimp, clams, calamari  & scallops are all nicely done.  My server forgot to add the lobster, however, and that came about 7 minutes later, along with a complimentary glass of Douro to atone for the misstep. What great service! The amount of lobster is small, as another poster mentioned. It was \"half a lobster,\" but really about the smallest tail and claw I've ever seen.   The only less than stellar mark is the bread. Mostly stale French, with a single, fresher sourdough slice that was good with the peppery olive oil.  The dessert list was tantalizing -- I had a hard time choosing but went with the Portuguese creme br√ªl√©e.  For the first time ever, not served in a single ramekin, but large dollops dotting the plate, each with a shard of torched sugar atop. A unique citrusy quality made this one of the best versions of a favorite dessert ever!"}
{"text":"Pricy, but best seafood restaurant in town. Always full, even at 11 pm on a Monday night. Best ambiance, awesome service n delicious food. A must try. Make sure u order the salmon tartare, its delicious."}
{"text":"Three years ago I tried Ferreira and was a bit disappointed. This time they were up to the task. For the food aficionado who enjoy a good mix of taste culture and ambience, Ferreira Cafe combine all of the above. Located in downtown Montreal, a city known for good food and culture they fit right in. Try their always good bacalhau (salt) and for a affordable but excellent wine Douro Reserva \"F\" 2012 or 13 all good years."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Montreal for our 10 year wedding anniversary with our 3 children and decided to do our 10 year anniversary dinner at Ferreira Cafe as per a recommendation of a friend. It saddens me to say that our experience was really the worse we have ever experienced....ever.   My younger son was crying when we entered the restaurant and after settling down at our table, I was just about to get up to take him to the bathroom to help him settle down, when the owner came up to our table and said that he could not have a crying child in his restaurant. He said that this is a business restaurant and not a place for children.  He did not give us a chance to soothe my child even after telling him that he is usually very well behaved at restaurants. He then repeated himself and essentially asked us to leave!!!!   Of note, we made reservations on Bookenda, and there is an option for # of children. Plus, I contacted the restaurant that morning inquiring about their 3 hour minimum for more than 4 people and my concern that with 3 kids we may not make it to the 3 hours. The person responded that there was no problem and that it was just a suggestion based on what is the usual. So they knew that we had kids and did not tell us that kids were not allowed!!   Unfortunately, I cannot recommend a restaurant where we were humiliated and dismissed on our 10 year anniversary. I would not recommend this restaurant for families!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this beautiful restaurant during my recent business trip to Montreal, and I'm happy that I made it one of my choices. In a city of French food, this Portuguese restaurant stands out with its commitment to fresh seafood. I sat at the bar and enjoyed a wonderful wine and the seafood rice. The rice was delivered to my plate in a very large pot. The bartender served me portions from this pot until I had cleaned it. The rice was filled with meaty and yummy chunks of seafood: clams, mussels, and shrimp. The juices of the seafood mixed with the rice created a paella-like dish that was delicious.  The food here is a bit expensive, but the quality and the service were top notch."}
{"text":"I don't know a lot of restaurant that's this jam packed on a monday lunch! I take this as a good sign as long as service is not affected and it was perfectly executed. Chapeau! I took the aragula and s√£o george cheese salad wich was very tasty but from my collegues plate it was the octopus that was the most beautiful plate.  For the main plate I took the cod, matane shrimps and spinach gratin. It was incredibly tasty and good but so filling! I ate half of it and was completely full. I'm not small eater normally and I love food so much I'd rather feel like a huge potatoe than leave good food on a plate. And yet, i sadly couldn't finish this.  Overall, ferreira is a lovely place. Looks good. Feels good. Taste good."}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful atmosphere and wonderful food. Ferreira has a certain buzz from the predominantly business casual crowd and the open kitchen near the back adds liveliness to the whole atmosphere.  The service was on par and the food was excellently prepared.  For appetizers, our group of 5 shared the sardines (only 4), the grilled calamari (excellent), and the crab cakes (very good). Everyone at the table was extremely pleased with their entrees and I especially enjoyed the special of the evening, sea bass with chanterelle mushrooms. For dessert, the grand finale and the mousse hit the spot. The raspberry sorbet accompanying the mousse was phenomenal!  I am not sure that any of the dishes were particularly Portuguese (with the exception of the chicken which was delicious) but a great experience as a whole."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood! This was a recommendation from the hotel I stayed at on a business trip to Montreal. I had the black bass, which was grilled over pur√©e  squash and seasoned veggies. The atmosphere was fantastic, and the place was very busy, even on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"After the so-so dining experience here last time, my boyfriend and I decided to give this restaurant another try.  This time, we went for the late night menu (available after 10pm) for $24.  We got the soup and sardine for appetizer and chicken and tartar for main courses. I also got the passion fruit   mille feuille for dessert.  The food was decent, but maybe because it was late at night? Everything felt very rough. The chicken was literally piled on a bunch of fries with very little presentation. Don't get me wrong, the tartar was fresh and the chicken was tasty. Maybe my expectation was too high for this restaurant.  The service was worse than what I expected as well. We had to wait for the waiter to refill our water despite there were very little people in the restaurant.   Short conclusion, food was good, service was just ok."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in Montreal, not only highly recommended by the locals, my entire party throughly enjoyed their meals. It goes without saying that this restaurant is very upscale and formal, but they also have outdoor seating which is rare for a good restaurant. The portions are small for their price but the delicious tastes make up for that. If you're visiting Montreal or live there i highly recommend the Ferreira Cafe !"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was the wrong choice of food ordered, but expected more of a wow, than what we got; especially after the place was raved about by the hotel concierge.  Wish that the server was more attentive and guided us in the choices we made.  Good, but not excellent."}
{"text":"Very pretentious restaurant that probably runs on its reputation. Food was ok but way overpriced. Cornish hen was mostly bones. Waiter took advantage of the fact that there were kids and ask them directly if they wanted a 2nd glass of coke without checking with parents. Water service was good but the rest is very pretentious. Had a tiny bug in wine glass which was 3/4 full. Waiter brought a new glass without apologizing and simply poured wine from the bottle we had purchased without offering any kind of apology...wasted almost a glass of wine. Most ironic thing is that despite the fact they are so pretentious, they didn't know how to properly cut a two-tier cake (although they charge 4$ per person for service of the cake)...they ended up ruining a 150$ cake (see pictures)."}
{"text":"This is what very good art tastes like!   Excellent service, excellent attention to detail, good selection of entrees, excellent desserts!   5 of us enjoyed a surprisingly great meal this evening. The oysters were amazing! The beef tar tar was killer! From there we enjoyed the filet, seafood rice, duck with risotto and cod.   The vanilla & chocolate natas were off the charts amazing for dessert!    A great port selection- we enjoyed the Tawny port tonight."}
{"text":"We tried: Homemade grilled chourico: Delicious, would try again.  Lamb chops: Meh. I've had better, I've had worse.   Seafood Bouillabaisse with Lobster: Undersalted, the soup tasted like watered-down tomatoes with no flavor at all.   Would not recommend for the price though I suppose it's a great date night place."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner from a reservation from a local. Absolutely delicious! Had the sardines bruschetta for app. Seafood rice paella, husband had sea bass, we shared chorizo, saut√©ed vegetables and broccoli rabe sides. Espresso and pasteis de Natas for dessert. Perfect night out and the kind service made it even better! Will come back next visit to Montreal!"}
{"text":"the outdoor seating is empty and they won't seat us there... they just want everyone to sit inside and uses the outside to entice customers to come in... we ate here but since it was so unmemorable, it probably was just so so and we won't be back!"}
{"text":"This is the most interesting restaurant I have been to in a long time. The menu is regional and excellent, the dishes are both flavorful and cooked perfectly, and the service and ambiance are top notch. Such a pleasure! Sit at the bar and enjoy the recommendations. Three words: sea urchin butter."}
{"text":"Incredible seafood.   Started with the grilled octopus and graduated to black cod.  Both spectacular.  Also they were great with Portuguese wine suggestions."}
{"text":"Wow! Un bonheur gustatif...j'adore les fruits de mer/poissons et j'ai √©t√© servie! Ce fut parfait! On a f√™t√© mon anniversaire et le service √©tait simplement impeccable! Je recommande fortement pour passer une excellente soir√©e!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals we have ever eaten. Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes fine food, likes excellent service, and likes a beautiful dining venue."}
{"text":"Hum, i'm a bit torn on Ferreira Cafe. It was a recommendation from the concierge at my hotel and fully packed to capacity when I arrived. I was excited by the patronage and despite the crowd, we were seated in minutes. Our waitress was super attentive and our table faced the kitchen. I steadily observed the kitchen staff, dirty plates on the ground and snacking off the food. One person on staff drank a beer, latte and red bull while preparing meals. I had the octopus salad, black cod and a dozen oysters. I was pleased with the octopus salad but disappointed in the black cod. At $40 and with such a flowery menu description, I was ready to be wowed. Unfortunately, perhaps due to a distracted staff, Ferriera just did not deliver on two basics---salt and pepper. It was aesthetically pleasing but very bland. One of my friends had a bone in his fillet and my other guest got the $51 mixed seafood plate with both missing and more bland seafood.   Between elements of bland and incomplete plates, I was underwhelmed. The service was great but I'll never eat there again."}
{"text":"Super popular restaurant in downtown Montreal. I was there for dinner. The seafood is delicious and waitress is very nice! I like the atmosphere, busy but everything in order."}
{"text":"Last week I was watching TV and saw their commercial in the portuguese show. It looked really amazing so I wanted to try it. I went there on a Sunday evening. Its situated on Peel street, in front of Cours Mont-Royal. The inside is really pretty, great ambiance music not too loud  but enough to give it a nice mood.  I was able to have a conversation.  As for the food, everything was amazing from the grilled calmari to the fresh salad, to the amazing rosted hen. Deserts we fantastic too, I suggest the taster platter where you get a variety of mini desserts.   Staff was great, they even check-in your coat, which is fantastic specially with those big winter coats.  I will definetily go back.  UPDATE  I went back a few weeks ago and it was even better than last time. I love the buzz and atmosphere in this place. Staff is great, food is delicious, you basically can't stop eating, it's that good. Very high quality food!!!! Love love love."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Fantastic service. Had the black cod which was phenomenal. Great house-labeled cabernet blend."}
{"text":"We went to eat here for their late night menu, from 10PM to close, on Monday-Saturdays. Man, it was awesome! The sardines have to be the tastiest sardines I've eaten, and damn, that octopus? Worth every extra penny. It tasted like sous vide unicorn horns, in a savory chili oil. Woowee. The flank steak was cooked perfectly and the duck confit risotto? Forget about it. Montreal people have it good."}
{"text":"Came here for the 10 pm late night menu with friends. For apps we had the grilled calamari, fried calamari, and sardine. The grilled calamari was the best. Entree we had salmon, steak, and seafood soup. The salmon was huge, so it's pretty worth it. The steak was good but a little too raw even though I asked for medium.   Overall the decor is nice and restaurant has great ambience. Everything for $25 !! Totally worth it"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service, wonderful atmosphere and strong signature cocktails. We had the bouillabaisse, duo lamb, tuna tartare, Portuguese creme br√ªl√©e and for drinks \"the derby\". I would encourage everyone to visit Ferreira Cafe for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I rarely do review, but I'd make exception for Ferreira.  It was simply a great dining experience. I came for late lunch and asked to be seated outside in the patio. Ordered the oysters, bouillabaisse and egg tart. The bouillabaisse is simply divine - the broth is not as buttery as other bouillabaisse, and the taste of the il mare/ all the seafood medley is just beyond my expectation. The fruit tart is also so good, even for myself who isn't into sweets as much. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this estanlishment. Even after the concierge @ our hotel suggested another portugese restaurant, I was the one adamant about coming here. My food left much to be desired: had to return my LOBSTER BISQUE :( (very cold), rack of lamb was bland, boring, and nasty. Just a very terrible  dining experience. My mother's food was decent, according to her... she obviously has fading tastebuds.. poor thing. Yet on a lighter note, the ambiance was pleasant & the music selection was good. The prices were over-the - top for such below average food! Great location, but will never return to this spot again. Not worth it at all!! :("}
{"text":"I desparately wanted to love this place, after recommendations from the hotel, a bunch of website, open table and yelp...  unfortunately, my husband's fresh fish of the day (Halibut).. lacked flavor (even basic salt) and the oomph we hoped to find at a top-rated expensive restaurant.   We went here for our third anniversary-- and although my cod with porcini was tasty, it was nothing spectacular.  Calimari was also very basic-- but I dont think there is anything you could really do with calamari-- however, I would like to comment that it was not overly chewy and very fresh....   Our service was impeccable and the the ambiance is delightful... BUT, I dont think I would be back, and if you are into picking a place for its great \"look\" and nice area, then go...  but dont expect an amazing culinary experience-- just a decent one... because it was a good experience, just not the best."}
{"text":"We didn't have reservation so ate at the bar with business partner on a Friday night. Reservations are needed for tables. Bar is set up for dinner service with plenty of room. Very good dinner and house wine from owner's vineyard in Portugal. I had Caldo Verde (Portuguese soup) and Codfish in tomatoes. Both were great. Priced similar to other downtown Montreal resturants.  They also own Cafe Vasco de Gama a few doors up on Peel. Another great breakfast/lunch/coffee stop. I will go back to both Ferreira and Vasco de Gama."}
{"text":"Loved the food!!!It was a delicious meal and the dessert Natas took the prize.Fresh seafood and amazing dessert...can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on our last night in Montreal. The service was horrible - our waitress seemed clueless. We were seated by the glass wall looking into the kitchen (cool). It took a little bit to give our drink order, then longer to actually receive them. We ordered  oysters to start followed by the grilled seafood platter for two. The oysters were nothing to write home about, especially after it took about 40 minutes for them to come out. The grilled seafood platter was smaller than we imagined, and when it showed up to the table it was missing the octopus. Overall the food was decent, nothing special, and the service was absolutely atrocious."}
{"text":"This is a must visit when in Montreal, but be sure to make a reservation as it books up quickly.  We were seated right away and right on time for our reservations.  The wait staff was very attentive and made three or four good recommendations from the wine list.  We went with a Portuguese red which was great, with a little spice/pepper kick.  Appetizer was the salmon tartar, served with toasted bread slices.  Fabulous.  Main course.  I had to have the house signature dish, the black cod with porcini mushroom port reduction sauce over a seafood melange.  Unbelievable.  Perfection.  The best cod I have ever eaten by a mile.  I want more now.  Where can I get this in LA?  Help me please!  Desert. Almond tart.  Super tasty, fresh, great crust. with fresh berries on the side.  Loved it mucho mucho.    Highly recommended.  Can't wait to go back next time I'm in the big M."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Portuguese food and have gotten the chance to try some great Portuguese restos in Montreal and while I did like this one I have some mixed reviews. The food itself was very well presented and the ingredients were fresh but there was nothing that really stood out especially given the prices I can't say I was blown away by the food. We tried the beef tarter ,seafood bouillabaisse , squid ink risotto and creme br√ªl√©e dessert - all the dishes were very beautiful to look at and the ingredients were fresh BUT Portuguese cooking is all about bold bright flavours and all the dishes were enjoyable they were all lacking that little extra something to make them memorable. Our server was friendly and came to check on us frequently , he also made a great wine suggestion to pair with our order. However , there was a man in a suit who I assume was maybe the manager that would also come around and check on the diners and ask us if we needed anything , we asked for more bread for the bouillabaisse and he seemed annoyed which I didn't like. The decor was very nice and elegant and perfect for a date night (they also offer outdoor seating during warmer seasons). I'm happy I finally tried this place but can't say that I plan to go back any time soon ."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Had the sept-iles shrimp to start, then the sea bass. Husband had the giant Russian prawns on half shell to start, then the tuna. Only complaint was getting the shells off all those little sept-iles shrimp. Food was cooked to perfection.  Nice pace of service, delicious food, lively atmosphere. It was expensive, but I would go back. --- One year later. Even better food and service. Yum!  I will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful place with excellent food and service! Grilled sardines and black cod were very, very good! Entree was slow coming out due to a large party but otherwise it was exceptional. I highly recommend Ferreira's!! I had dinner at the bar and service was excellent - thank you Veronique and team!"}
{"text":"Oysters were so-so. But the grilled black cod was darned amazing!  The eye-candy servers in tight dresses definitely do not hurt either  Cost-wise, definitely on the high side"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful Ambiance, Service, Food !! A great place for seafood lovers. If you don't eat seafood, the Chef will make you something based on your restrictions. Pricey but Classy."}
{"text":"I cam in here a few weekends ago and was impressed. All I had were some apps - chourico, sardines and grilled calamari, but I can say that next time I'm in Montreal, I'm going to tear into this menu. Can't believe I left without trying the black cod or the octopus.  For the record, if you're used to Luso-American cuisine - this is not it. Don't get me wrong, it's excellent. But if you come here, expect Portuguese inspired, well thought-out dishes at a premium price point.  Recommended."}
{"text":"This place is excellent its sofisticated and traditional Portuguese food is top. You can see the active cooks and chefs as they have an open kitchen, all products  are fresh"}
{"text":"Overall I had a nice experience here.  A local recommended this place.  I sat at the bar and found the options of food and wine to be very nice.  I really liked the atmosphere, it is has a classy-upscale-trendy setting, but with a casual feeling.  I enjoyed my main dishes (chicken and minestrone soup), the ingredients were very fresh, however, a tad oily.  I gave this 3 stars as I think the prices are a bit too high and don't pair well with what you recieve.  I had two small tapa bites of tuna and salmon tartar, the chicken entree, and two glasses of wine for $98 CD.  I came close to giving this four stars b/c the service, experience, atmosphere are great...and the food... good."}
{"text":"So for my birthday dinner we decided to finally eat here. The food is really really good. I mean I'm a fan of seafood so it doesn't disappoint. The bill is hefty so that is just something to prepare for. Some people enjoy spending money on food others don't. This is preference.  The problem I have is this: service!   If you are going to charge the amount you do and rate yourself as a high end dining establishment you have got to be spot in with your service. It took about an hour before the appetizers reached us and the same time before we got drinks. Main course was an other hour after that. It's a funny thing service it really has a way of not making you want to go back even though the food was very very good. This has to do with what high end dining has become : an experience ! You want the whole shebang especially when you are paying for it."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about trying this restaurant. I like Portuguese food, rustic and no fuss. I did not think you could have a gastronomical meal with Portuguese cuisine. I was wrong... Very wrong. This was a delectable experience on every level.   Is it expensive? Yes, about 70/person, no alcohol.  Is it worth it? Yes, it's that good. When a restaurant offers such a wide array of fresh fish, it's only normal that the meal is priced accordingly, without mentioning the downtown location.  Enough about details... Let's talk about the food. Salmon tartare: fresh, delicious (If I must criticize, chopped a little too coarsely for my taste). Octopus: absolutely delicious. Well balanced and originally garnished.  Fried calamari: simple but very good. Black cod: great... Just great. Seafood rice: so tasty and everything was exceptionally fresh.  Mixed desserts: wonderful.   The service is friendly and impeccable. The restaurant is beautiful. Reservations are strongly recommended.  Note: yes, there are good options when it comes to Portuguese dining in Montreal, but no one comes close to Ferreira for quality, freshness, taste and service. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My parents were raving about the black cod  in this place and so I had to go try it! Cooked to perfection over a bed of mashed potatoes and wild mushrooms with a sweet brown sauce all placed in a bowl. Absolutely delicious. I also tried the grilled calamari and the lobster and crab salad. Both also delicious, but the black cod was by far the best.   Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant seemed expensive, but I figured it would be a treat and probably worth the money.  The people were friendly if you looked like you had money.  I was dress business casual, but I definitely got different service than the guy with the rolex next to me.    I had the Roasted salted cod fish, onion and tomato.  It came out without the tomato so I thought I got the wrong dish.  The bar host looked at me like I was crazy then the waiter said he grabbed the plate before the kitchen was done dressing it.  An how,  it was pretty much just fish onion and tomato.  Not anything order again at any price let alone $28 a plate.  With wine and a salad I was out $50.  I agree with the other low review that it's really not worth the price."}
{"text":"Food, service and interior design was top! I think this place just became one of my favorite restaurants. The seafood was really tasty! Must try"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Nice atmosphere, friendly service, and outstanding food. I had the risotto with lobster and mushrooms, and it was wonderful. The owner (Carlos) is at the restaurant and makes sure everything runs well."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to eat here 1 week ago due to the great reviews.  We asked for a quiet table and they gave us an acceptable table.  But it is a noisy place. The porcini crusted black cod came with a layer of fat on the bottom side. They should have told me -instead I took a bite not knowing -it was a terrible taste and ruined the rest of it for me- the waitress did apologize for not warning me said it's how they serve it and some people love the taste.  I just can't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The ambience and restaurant is very nice and classy. Service was excellent. I had the salmon with vegetables which originally isn't on the menu on Sunday's but they still accommodated me. I would go again"}
{"text":"The restaurant opens out onto the sidewalk under a cobalt blue awning and has a chic Mediterranean vibe. Unfortunately, the restaurant's host wasn't very personable, and the wait staff seemed scattered. At least I found the food to be enjoyable as it got progressively better with each dish...  Portuguese-style Oysters (cooked with chorizo, cheese, and tomato sauce) - I usually prefer oysters raw, but thought \"When in Rome...\" After trying the Portuguese-style oysters, I still think they are better raw. The toppings completely overwhelmed the oysters, and all I could taste was salty tomato sauce. The only way I could even tell there was an oyster in there was the slight oceany taste on the finish.   Fleur de Sel Roasted Sardines with Tapenade - nicely roasted, plump sardines with just the right amount of salt and olive oil. Simple and appetizing.   Porcini-crusted Roasted Black Cod on a Port Reduction and Mashed Potatoes - beautifully cooked piece of cod...perfectly even, super moist, and served at the right temperature. A feat given its enormous size. I expected an earthy flavor from the crust, but couldn't taste the porcini and thought the fish needed a tad more salt.   Grilled Giant Tiger Prawns with Tomato Risotto - I'm always a sucker for big, juicy prawns and these did not disappoint. I also loved the tangy tomato risotto. It was delightfully light and vibrant for a risotto. A fantastic pairing with the prawns.   Almond Tart with Port-poached Pears - the best part of the meal. This almond tart was AWESOME! I can't remember when I've had an almond tart *this* good. I loved the combination of the brittle crust with the warm, sweet almond filling and the ripe poached pears. The pear sorbet was also a welcome addition and a smooth palate cleanser. Since Ferreira Caf√© boasts the largest collection of ports in North America, I had to get a glass with dessert. I can't remember the name of the port I had, but I recall being pleasantly surprised at how light it was and how well it complemented the almond tart.  While the seafood was good at Ferreira Caf√©, I will forever remember it for its amazing almond tart!  **For pics of each course, visit my blog linked under my profie. Enjoy!**"}
{"text":"Came here late on Valentines after another place.  Sat at the bar and the server there was awesome, super friendly, knowledgable and helpful. She explained the menu and how the fresh fish system works with the weights, filleting, types of fish etc. We ended up getting her octopus appy recommendation, and the daily catch. She recommended a Portuguese fish that's very popular at the restaurant, saying that it has a slightly nutty flavour. I forget the name but I will post a photo of it. The octopus appy was delicious, perfectly cooked. Beautiful texture and flavour. Then came the fish which is filleted and served Infront of you after it's cooked. The fish was incredible, it was moist, fatty, flavourful, kind of silky in a way. And the veggies and sauce to go along with it matched well. We really felt spoiled and lucky to have gotten a seat there. If ever back in Montreal, we will be eating here again.  Great restaurant - decor, ambience, cleanliness, service and food....all wonderful and very well done."}
{"text":"Been dying to go for years and husband finally took me for my bday. (He's not the biggest fan of Portuguese food. I know - how do you love someone who doesn't love olive oil, bacalhau cakes and pasteis de natas??) Anyway, I loved it! They fly their fish in daily from Portugal. Must have: octopus appetizer and black cod main meal. And if you dare leave without having a pasteis de nata, you don't deserve to go back."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE octopus, especially any kind of grilled octopus. So I am always on the look out for restaurants in Montreal that dare to tackle it. Ferreira's crispy octopus appetizer didn't disappoint. It was so incredibly tender and flavorful. I also had the seafood bouillabaisse which was delicious - or rather, the broth was incredible. The fish and seafood itself was good, but I think the fresh whole fish options would have been the better bet if you are really craving a dish that highlights the fish. I had the chocolate mousse as my dessert. Just as a heads up, the menu for the desserts does not at all do a good job describing what you are getting. I had expected a simple, but intense, mousse. Instead, it was a very complex plate with mousse, ganache, candied preserved lemon, meringue, lemon custurds, a sorbet, and other delights. Absolutely amazing. I will say, that my family ordered the creme brule and the salted caramel, and while they enjoyed it, everyone agreed that the chocolate dish was the star. Overall, it is clear that the restaurant takes great care in its ingredients - many ingredients are flown in from Portugal several times a week. I would definitely recommend it - if you are okay with the price point which is fairly high, but considering the quality it does make sense. Make sure you book ahead, as it fills up very quickly."}
{"text":"Appetizers were excellent. Octopus, tuna tartar and sardines were all excellent. Main dishes (whole fish sea bass and black cod) were both very good, but not the same level as appetizers. Service was terrific, very nice room / ambiance. Exceptional weather allowed folding front doors to be open, which added to the ambiance.   Overall, a very solid restaurant experience."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best overall restaurants in Montreal.  I have been going here for well over 10 years.  It never disappoints, the decor is welcoming, warm, with an understated sophistication.  The staff is always  great at guiding you through the menu and making great suggestions,r always there when you need them and have been well trained in the art of anticipating the needs of their guests.  The sommelier Victor is my go to person, every time we go we love to say hello and let him choose the perfect wine.  I have been there many times with various friends, each with their own expectations and everyone without fail has come away happy to have discovered this gem.  Some of the standout dishes are the Quail, the sardines and anything from the sea.  The menu changes regularly as per the seasons and they usually have a great specials menu, the cost is on the upper range but definatly well worth the price, the wines are as varied in cost but with Victors guidance you can usually find something in your budget. Older post from my blog: Ok this one has been tooted as one of the top 10 Portuguese restaurants in North America...it is said that people fly into Montreal all the time just to have supper here. They have an alltimehandsdownfavorite dish ....Grilled Sardines!! We recently tried there mixed seafood plate and got kudos all the way around...it can be pricey and a reservation should be made but if you feel like adventure....go for it.  Adding the beef cheeks, new to the 2006 menu just because it is really good so if you have a non seafood eater in the group...tell them not to fear"}
{"text":"Went here once with colleagues, did not pay too much attention to the food but overall kinda like it"}
