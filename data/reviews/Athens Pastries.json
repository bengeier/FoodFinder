{"text":"1. Loukoumades (Fried dough balls with honey): fully soaked in the honey syrup and sprinkled with cinnamon. Good, but probably even better when warm. 

2. Galaktoboureko (Greek custard pie): Loaded with custard. The custard was not too sweet and wasn't like a smooth pudding consistency; it was thicker and not runny."}
{"text":"They make very few things, but make them perfectly. The custard pastry and the loukoumathes (aka honey balls) are my favourites."}
{"text":"Best store bought loukoumades (honey balls) ever. I've tried loukoumades everywhere from places in Chicago and New York to festivals in Greece. Homemade are slightly different and great in their own way but Athens Pastries wins by a mile for store bought."}
{"text":"Delicious Spanikopita and Lokomades. Considered one of the top Greek pastry restos in TO. Come enjoy a light snack and a Greek (aka Turkish) coffee."}
{"text":"Great coffee,  great pastries. Pastries are always fresh.  Anything I have tried over the years has been great.. my favourite is a spinach pie followed by a custard pie accompanied by two lattes."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh the louka whatever is so delicious. They don't look that great but they're juicy little bites of heaven. We ordered a dozen and got a dozen more on our way out. That's all I tried here and I will be back for more. The staff wasn't that friendly, they had a bit of an attitude. The kind of attitude that staff at busy little places with good food typically has."}
{"text":"The Loukoumades are always fresh, the price is ridiculously cheap for this memorable food experience, you simply will not find a better Loukoumada anywhere - this is the real Greek Timbit!
quality is always top notch
order in bulk, then get a gym membership, because you will always want \"just one more\""}
{"text":"I had their honey balls, they were very sweet, but so good. I couldn't stop eating them! Their spinach pies aren't bad either. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I Need a tyropita ( cheese pie)  once a week or I quit. thats the deal i have with myself, and Athens is my place of choice. I used to do the Spinach pie, but then decided to get rid of all that pesky nutrition.

 Its clean, fast, tasty, open late enough, and the Girls are pretty cute. All of these things build to a popular hang for Woody. 

when i am feeling a bit more like a sweet, the honeyballs here are insanely good, but will destroy you. I like to pair it with a greek coffee, which, is sort of like eating directly out of the coffee filter. SUPER bitter, and strong, but a perfect counter to the honey balls. I've heard other say you should share the dozen, but.. well, i have never had an issue."}
{"text":"For an evening snack alone or with a friend, this lovely place offers a warm and inviting atmosphere and delicious savoury and sweet desserts.  A friend brought me here, years ago, to share a treat; now I warm-up at the thought of stopping in or sharing the simple experience with someone."}
{"text":"I SUPER DUPER LOOOVE THEIR GALAKTOBOUREKO! I should have gotten the whole freaking pan. I only wish the buttery phyllo layers were more crispy but the custard was unbelievable! This is a same-day/one-sitting dessert not only 'cuz it's impossible to save for later (or for other people)-- BUT I heard the phyllo gets soggy & the custard gets mushy. GOOD GOD IT'S FATAL."}
{"text":"Two words: honey balls ... (or officially called: Loukoumades). They are so delicious! If you haven't had them, you HAVE NOT lived! 

(My heart goes out to you gluten-intolerant friends for not being able to indulge in these delicious balls of heavenly, honey-soaked doughnut delight). Everyone else: Please go out and get them NOW! Seriously, at $3.50 per dozen, they're a steal!

The flaky pies are delicious too. In fact, Athens knows the secret to a good food establishment: offer few items, but do them all right. Quantity is not quality... Sorry Serano Bakery, you've got nothing on Athens Pastries!"}
{"text":"Those honeyballs are like crack. I had one and ended up eating a dozen. 

A guest brought them to our place as a hostess gift. I didn't get around to eating them until 2 days later. I popped them into the microwave for 10 seconds and they tasted soft and de-li-cious. 

I'm addicted now."}
{"text":"I've been dropping by at Athens Pastries for a few years now; I really like this place! 

The place is small, narrow, and clean. The menu is not that big but everything is great! They have a small place to sit down inside, but I notice that most people get things to go. I enjoy the coffee's here a lot, especially their frappe (Greek iced-foamed coffee) and their Greek coffee; they make them perfectly.  They also have yummy Greek pies: spanakopita (spinach pie made out of phyllo pastry) and tiropita (cheese pie made out of phyllo pastry). Their loukoumades are a hit here (fried- dough honey balls) - basically the Greek version of a doughnut, but way better.

The staff is here so warm and kind which is a great bonus to this place. The prices are very reasonable. Some items like the loukoumades are really cheap. I did a double take at the menu up on the wall when I read: dozen loukoumades for $3.00, what?!!

I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm. The tiropita is heaven. This place is simple and to the point. It screams \"we have 5 or 6 pastries for you, we know they're good and you're going to like them\" and doesn't try to get into thousands of other things it will suck at. The price is a bit steep for the simplicity of the food but you'll get over it once you taste the stuff.
Again, close to TTC and kid friendly which is handy. They have plenty of seating both inside and out and easy take-away options too."}
{"text":"Best loukoumades in the city...hands down!  And the price is right!
Perfect ending to a meal at Messini down the road."}
{"text":"The loukoumades here are so good! I think around $3 for approx. a dozen, which is more than reasonable. They go heavy on the honey but I'm really not complaining here. Friendly people and quality products!"}
{"text":"If you are familiar with Greek pastry, then this is the place to go. It is a lovely, cozy and easily found place at Danforth, close to Pape intersection.

We have been there several times, mostly for their famous loukoumades, as those are amazingly good there. Fresh, sweet and covered with cinnamon (of course if you agree to that). The Galaktoboureko has been equally good, but it is really hard to taste other stuff, while honey balls sit heavily on our minds...or rather in our mouth :)

The place is tiny, but there is enough room to dine-in or stand by a bar table for quick snack. Do not be overwhelmed while stepping in by the long line. It goes fast, as the double team of black dressed girls do their job great. Just be aware that you can't pay with card, cash only. The great thing is that you can buy 6 or 12 loukoumades and there is no tax! Yay!

For ultimate experience I suggest to order dozen of loukoumades and a cup of black tea, sit back at the end of the shop and just enjoy being present."}
{"text":"This pizza was so good. We had the feature today with cayenne infuse salami and a cayenne maple drizzle."}
{"text":"I hate myself when I come here. The loukoumades...I fantasize bathing myself in these...don't forget the cinnamon!!!

WARNING: need tissues and/ or wet naps when eating these scrumptious little balls of calories. (Urgh...I hate cardio.) Parents...your children will not come out of this clean if left unsupervised consuming these..."}
{"text":"Best loukoumades. They burst with honey when you bite in to the crispy outter layer. $3.50 for a dozen is so reasonable. I always find the service fast & efficient."}
{"text":"We went here for some late night pastry and coffee but the menu was fairly small and the food was just average at best. Been to better pastry places, but this is the first that's open this late, this is more of a cafe on the danforth. Nothing special here though."}
{"text":"Yum yum. Spanakopita & cheese pie! Great midnight snack. Only take cash but worth it!"}
{"text":"Them honey balls (Loukoumades) are soooo addicting! Right when you bite into them a gush of liquid comes out! (in a good way). I think they would be even better if they were warm/hot. Went to Athens Pastries twice because they were so good and both were cold. I guess that's how they're served. Cash only!"}
{"text":"Athens Pastries has well-priced spanakopita that's flaky, tasty, and cut up into bite-sized pieces. However, I admit that I've always wondered why it's a bit flat. The only thing that would make it better would be more fillings.

The loukomades are tasty, but they hit hard with the honey. I recommend sharing them with a few friends, because after eating two, I just can't eat them anymore.

A sweet little cafe, and an authentically Greek spot on the ever-changing Danforth."}
{"text":"They have been around forever - and I've been getting Greek pastries here since I was a kid. I really really love their Tiropita and their Bougatsa. Their Spanakopita is pretty good too - but it's a little bit sweet for my liking. There are better places on the Danforth to get Spanakopita. 

It's a cute almost cafe-style place, and the greek coffee they serve is STRONG. You can get pies and pastries to go or sit at the back with a coffee. It always smells delicious in here and you can even watch them pulling the pies out of the oven. When you get anything for takeout - it's still really good heated up the next day. But try to re-heat in the oven because the microwave makes the pastry a big soggy. 

Overall, a great place to go because it's fast, affordable, fresh, and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is all about the delicious pies! Its a no frills, family owned business that has some of the best tiropita, loukoumades,spanakopita, and the custard pie (of which I forget the name). 

The Loukoumades are seriously delicious and bursting with honey goodness! Their pies are made fresh and baked and cut right in front of you. Its really hard for me to resist getting one of each of their offerings, as they are all just SO good. 

They have coffee, espresso's, lattes, ect.... but for me its all about the food. And its ridiculously cheap! $3 will get you a dozen loukoumades, and the pies are about $2 - 3 as well. I like to come here, get a cup of tea and have some pie. I also like to take some for home. 

Definitely check this place out if you are in the area, they are worth repeat visits!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite place. Athens has good reputations for pies and their pies are very good. Their prices are good. You can have a cup of coffee and a good size piece of pie just for around $5.00. The atmosphere is good and their services are good. Their coffee is also very good. I like to hang out there."}
{"text":"Great place the cheese and spinach pies are always so warm and the honey dough balls are just special I could eat 100 dozens every day GOOD JOB ATHENS"}
{"text":"We had ventured to this location many times because the food is delicious, unfortunately I will not be going back again due to the customer service I received on my most recent visit. Because there was a simple misunderstanding about whether my order was for \"here\" or \"to go\", I was yelled at and scolded by one of the employees. As an independent business owner myself, I can't believe they would treat one of their customers this way (especially over something so trivial)."}
{"text":"I stopped in Athens Pastries after lunch in the Danforth area this past weekend.  The fresh Greek pastries were calling to me as my SO and I walked in.  We opted for the sugary and fried deliciousness - LOUKOUMADES!  We ordered a dozen to share with an americano to balance out the sweetness.  Price was killer, what we ordered was under $6!

I will definitely come back to try out all the different pies and pastries they have.

Make Athens Pastries you sweet tooth stop on the Danforth!"}
{"text":"I have gone there quite a few times now - their pies are always lukewarm and/or stale."}
{"text":"Imagine the perfect balance of soft and crunchy pastry. Then put amazing spinach, cheese, meet or custard inside that perfect pastry. You will have the best spanakopita, tiropita, kreatopita, or galatopita you have ever tasted.
I grew up around the corner and over the 18 years I lived at home I have never got tired of Athens. On top of what I mentioned above their honey balls are fantastic, the staff are polite and the restaurant is well maintained. I have literally nothing negative to say about it. If you are ever in the Danforth area make a trip to Athens your top priority!"}
{"text":"Service friendly. Coffee decent. Pastries... Omg . great place to drop in take a break and indulge"}
{"text":"I always stop here when I'm in Greektown for spanikopita, tyropita, and loukamades.  Don't know what they are?  Delicious, that's all you need to know.  There may be better places in the area, but these are definitely great.  And I think it's a very good price for them - not too pricey at all.

Definitely visit this place!  Efharisto!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I brought a new friend who just moved to Canada to check this place out. When we came to the window the was very little and she asked ime if that's all they had left. We walked in and there was a line up, the 10 feet of fridges where full of the cheese pies, the staff where busy baking the could not come out of the oven fast enough. This place is a must."}
{"text":"I've been back since my last review. The honey balls are 12/$3. We also got a custard dessert which was nice as it wasn't too sweet and the phyllo was quite flakey $3.40."}
{"text":"My only experiences with Greek food has usually been over cooked grilled meats and mediocre pastries.  My wife is part Greek and this place was her favorite food stop in Toronto.  We both had the spanakopita, and the honey dipped pastries.  The spanakopita melted in your mouth...perfectly prepared without overcooking the phyllo dough.  This place is a definite neighborhood joint, the food is excellent, and the prices are even better.  Looking forward to our next..."}
{"text":"Love this Danforth mainstay - faves are the spanakopita (spinach pie) and loukoumathes (honey balls). Great to grab anything from here and walk along the Danforth snacking on your pastry."}
{"text":"...

Before walking in you smell an inviting aroma...
then you see enticing pastries...
your mouth begins to salivate slightly as you anticipate...
then you taste...oohhh sweet, smooth, creamy custard in flaky philo...

While you sip coffee at a sidewalk table on a nice day...
watching entertaining people strolling by."}
{"text":"Came to the Danforth on a sunny crisp Sunday morning and stopped by for coffee. The friendly lady owner greeted me and said their galaktoboureko just came out of the oven. Who am I to pass up on fresh baked anything that just came out of the oven. The center was a slightly sweet custard and the phyllo pastry was crispy on the top with a dusting of cinnamon and soft on the bottom from soaking in syrupy goodness. With my black coffee to balance out the overall sweetness, my inner fat kid was content. I hear their honey balls are the bomb!  Will have to lick their balls, honey balls, next time."}
{"text":"Delicious Greek desserts!! 

If you have a sweet tooth try the honey glazed custard pastry ($4) or the Loukoumathes (honey balls). They also have a savory version of the custard pastry (custard pie) - sweet custard sandwiched between buttery phyllo flakes. 

Tips: 
Cash only! 
Difficult to find street parking on Danforth, although several Green P lots nearby."}
{"text":"When we walk the Danforth this is a staple for good Greek pastry. I almost always get the meat pie.

The Honey Balls are very good, if a little too sweet."}
{"text":"Still the best in the city and maybe all of Greece. This is not an exaggeration! I love coming here (2-3 times a month) usually alone. The galaktoboureko, a phyllo custard dessert sometimes served warm if you get it fresh out of the oven mmm it is to die for.  I always ask for double cinnamon on mine. The place itself is cute, very well run and because of the limited selection, it is always good and busy. A turn off is sometimes they use plastic forks and knives, I find this cheapens the experience and you know how I feel about plastic (poison).  Several times I purchased an entire tray for a parties, it was a hit!  Regardless where you eat on the Danforth, come here for a light desert, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The Galaktoboureko (phyllo custard dessert) used to bring me here though I hadn't visited this place in eons. I prefer the desserts to be not overly sweet so not a fan of Loukoumades which are well recommended by regulars. 
The Galaktoboureko hasn't changed and is still a winner. I didn't get a chance to try any coffee on this visit as this was a strictly takeout endeavor. I would recommend picking up a dessert from here as it will surely surprise your guests because it is not your regular dessert for sure. Very nicely balanced. 
Definitely worth a visit if you are in this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Visited this place a few times for their galaktoboureko and other pastries. Yammy!!! Highly recommended if you crave something sweet."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries! I always try to stop by here when I'm near Fairview mall. Their pastries are warm, flaky, and not overly sweet. Have to try their honey balls, it is like a freshly fried timbit drenched in honey water. You can ask for half a dozen of honey balls instead of a dozen. Remember to bring cash, restaurant is cash only."}
{"text":"The Honey balls (Loukoumades)  are the sweetest thing I've ever tasted and so amazing it hurts. We got them takeout so I can't rate the place on service, decor or anything like that but OMG, it was 3.50 for 12 Honeyballs  so 7 for 24 and and 14$ for 48!!!. ( I think I did the math right.....) GO GO GO GO. They are delicious and so worth it."}
{"text":"Walking around the Danforth, I always wanted to try this place out due to its popularity, the fresh smell of pastries when I walk pass it and its infamous Loukoumades. That and I want to compare the loukoumades in Serano.

So one afternoon, I came here to try out the loukoumades. I forgot how much it is but it comes with a dozen of those flaky, soft and overly fat loukoumades. I ordered them for takeout and decided to eat while walking around and I somewhat regretted it. Also that the store at that time were occupied by a group of old and loud Greek men and they somewhat look seedy. 

The loukoumades itself compared to Seranos were too sweet, fat and oily that after one bite, I almost had a heart attack and felt really bad. Although these \"greek timbits\" are larger than the ones in Serano and with the pricing and how much they gave me, its not too shabby. 

I would definitively come back to try something out like Spanakopita, next time during lunch or so!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best spanikopita and loukoumades in Toronto. Don't bother going anywhere else for these delicious delights. They are not only scrumptious but incredibly consistent each time I visit. The prices are reasonable and quality can't be beat."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to stop by after a meal for some loukoumades and Greek coffee. The honey balls are delicious and excellent for sharing. The service is quick and super friendly. They've also got various pies like spinach, cheese and custard. I really like the fact that they are open til 11pm. You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"I was craving some loukomades and decided to try this place out.  You can't beat the price at under $4 for a dozen.  They were pretty good but their menu is somewhat limited.  For a Greek pastry shop why don't you have baklava!?!?  Service wasn't very friendly either but I was just getting take out so maybe they would have been nicer if I dined in or I caught them on an off day?? If I'm ever in the area I may try them again.  Who knows, maybe I'll have better luck next time."}
{"text":"Love this place next door to me now I can eat my fill of those little honey ball timbit things without having to venture down to the Danforth. I hate parking on the Danforth. 

The next time you're invited to a dinner party pick up a desert here; the quality, presentation and wrapping is top shelf. It even put a smile on the face of my hostess :-) 

Staff here do a good job but need to lighten up a bit. See ya again friends!"}
{"text":"2 words: Honey Balls. 
OK, technically, loukoumades...but really, i just say Honey Balls. With cinnamon sprinkled on it. 
$3 for a dozen? AMAZING
Crusty on the outside with a sweet honey glaze...soft on the inside when it absorbs the honey...AWESOME"}
{"text":"I came in here for a quick bite while catching up with a friend. We were in the area and needed a spot that was open past 9pm and would have dairy-free dessert options. Bingo bango, Athens Pastries fit the bill.

The place is bright and casual, and the service is very friendly. I got the loukoumades - honey balls. They are sweet as hell, so if you're not into sweet, beware. I'm not into sweet, but I still managed to devour 6 of them. They were just so springy, spongey and sticky... once I popped, I couldn't stop! 

They also had a good selection of teas and other dairy-filled things that I kind of ignored. 

Check this spot out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"FRICK..these I got HONEYBALLS on my mind.

My Greek friend has got me addicted to these delicious honey-soaked waaaaay-better-than-tim-bit-shaped dough.

Get it with cinnamon.
These things are cheap and you're gonna want to eat the whole box yourself.  
So to make sure you don't... open the box in a room full of people.  walk away.
DO it! walk AWAY from the box...and come back 15 minutes later.
If you are lucky there will be one left.

Tiny little place is open late and is usually filled up with Greek post-dinner families.
So get these bad boys to go.

These are like..the greek equivalent to the Korean red-bean balls in K-town.

Every culture makes a good ball.
It really IS the superior form for dessert."}
{"text":"High quality limited menu. Everything they make is fantastic! Never had a bad experience here ever!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the Danforth and have room in my stomach, I try to make a stop here. This is the bakery the made me fall in love with loukemedes, sweet, succulent honey balls with a soft, oozey centre and crispy exterior dusted with the warmth of cinnamon... The definition of a mouthgasm. The best part is eating them with your hands and getting your fingers sticky! Also tried the spanikopita and the meat pie (can't recall the name); it'd be nice if the girl behind the counter smiled instead of giving me a dead look while I butchered the pronunciation (didn't even bother saying them, she used \"pies\" and \"honey balls\"; given an Asian girl a break here!) Can't recall the price, but it was under $20 for a dozen loukemedes and three pies. The service is quick and polite, if not overly friendly, but that's alright, I'm just here for the honey balls..."}
{"text":"The best galaktabourikas I have ever had!!!  Ask for the cinnamon on top it is surprisingly a nice touch."}
{"text":"So had to get some Greek desserts while I was on Danforth. Came highly recommended by my local friends and they HAD to take me there after dinner. They just said, \"Honey Balls...that's all you need to know.\"

I wasn't sure if I was sold, but I wanted some good dessert anyways, so we popped in.

Now, they are loukoumades on the menu and they are only $3.50 for a dozen. Sooooo, why not eat a dozen? We split a dozen and definitely wanted to go back to for more. Definitely a good sugar fix and is great to snack on outside on a summer night in Toronto."}
{"text":"There are enough Greek restaurants in the area. It's nice to have a store that sells something different. If you come here, the pastries are a must! I don't find the drinks very special but I guess you need something to go with their wonderful pies. 

I've tried most of their pastry goods. Spinach pie is my favourite. Meat pie is good too. The custard pies make a very nice dessert. Like most Greek food, it's pretty heavy. Each time I have Greek food I feel virtually disabled afterwards and need a nap. 

Prices are reasonable too. For $3.75 + tax, you get a decent sized piece of pie. I suppose if you want something like a meal, 2 pies should be enough for the average eater."}
{"text":"This is a review just for the food since my family got pastries to go. We had the galaktoboureko and the loukomades. Omg... so good! The galaktoboureko was not too sweet, super flaky on top, thick custard inside and just a touch of cinnamon on top. 5 stars! The loukomades are dripping with syrup-y goodness. Not my cup of tea (since I don't like super sweet things), but the rest of my family loved them. This was my first time trying greek pasteries and won't be my last.

If I had seen the this place on yelp before I went there I would have tried other things so I could review them. Haha it seems like everyone is just reviewing the galaktoboureko and loukomades, but Athens has other delicious looking pasteries too! Oh well, next time. :)"}
{"text":"This is a staple pastries place.  If you are a regular here, you know exactly what you're getting.  It's pretty much the same every time, and the same is good and consistent.  I love the honey balls, and both spinach and meat pies are equally as good, so it makes it hard to decide what you want when you come in.  A few years ago, the staff was friendly, but as of recently, not really that kind.  At first I thought okay, this place is pretty good but recently, I went to London Ontario to a place called Covenant market, and there was a spinach pie I bought from a place called Hot Oven, and mother have mercy, that place takes the cake, it melts in your mouth, but considering that I live in Toronto...this will give me a good fix."}
{"text":"Awesome little Greek bakery.  This place is a small café/bakery. They have all of the typical sweets and pies.  I've been here a few times and they always seem to have something fresh coming out of the oven and it's always full of people speaking Greek so you know it's gotta be the real thing.

Try the Loukoumades, to die for!!  $3 for a dozen!"}
{"text":"I always have a sudden craving for a cheese pie and custard pie from ATHENS once in awhile and I always get both, for a bit of sweet and salty. it is delicious! the filo pastries is nice and flaky with lots of filling! yum! This was what I used to eat growing up and living in the Greek Town, now that I moved, I STILL come here once in awhile for my Greek food fix."}
{"text":"The best cheese and custard pies! flaky crust with great amount of filling. quick ready, grab and go!


however this parking lot is the worst I have ever seen"}
{"text":"In need of some after-dinner Dessert & Espresso Beverage, I arrived to Esquire Plaza for a quick visit to TD Bank and noticed a Pastry Shop next door.  Naturally I walked in and it had that Cafe setting to it which made me feel much more comfort to relax here.  The background mumbled Greek conversations from the patrons made it that much more comfort.  It's all Greek to me!

WaYnE:  What's that on the far left tray?  Is that sweet?
Ladies:  Which one? The round or rectangles?
WaYnE:  I think that one with the \"G\" word.
Ladies:  Galaktobouriko(Greek to me)?  Yes, that is sweet.
WaYnE:  I'll have 1 \"G\" please, thank you.

The real name of that Sugar Syrupped Phyllo Custard is \"Galaktobouriko($3.30)\" and as much as I'm a fan of Mille Feuilles, I enjoyed this just as much.  Slightly sugar syrup coated and while the Custard looks a bit curdled, it is simply because the Custard was baked in the process.

Thank you Athens Pastries.  You have confirmed to me that the Loukoumades(12/$3.00) I've had somewhere during the Toronto Greek Street Festival(Taste of Danforth) is subpar.  Mostly because its been pre-made and sitting around while I was handed some of the fresh out-of-the-oven Pastries at Athens.  My inferior Loukoumades experiences has given me a long distaste for Greek Desserts until now.  

Athens' version is not that soggy ball of dough that I can't get out of my mental memory card.  The one I had here has a crisper outer layer which makes is less likely to over-absorb the sugar syrup.  This means both Texture and Flavour Balance is much better for my preference.  The ones  before were so sugar loaded that it was a doughier version of Baklavas.

Short & Sweet Menu(some items): Spinach Pie, Cheese Pie, Meat Pie, Cream Pie, Loukoumades, Galaktobouriko, Espresso Beverages, Teas, Misc Drinks, etc..."}
{"text":"I've had two things from here; their honey balls (loukoumades) and the spinach pie (spanakopita). I am never disappointed. If I lived any closer to this place, I'm pretty sure I'd be about 10x heavier, and my wallet would be 10x more thin. If I could marry food, undoubtedly I would put a ring on those loukoumades. I am both happy and concerned that they opened a new location at Toronto East General Hospital - being a volunteer there, the new, easy access to these honey balls may prove to be an actual danger to my health (but at least I'll be at the hospital already)."}
{"text":"The place is small but very cozy!
I love the spinach pies here! Usually the spinach pies are very oily but here it's absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"If you only eat one savoury thing in Toronto, it has to be fried pork and chive dumplings at Dumpling House on Spadina. But if you have only one dessert... get here... get the Greek Honey Balls. I'm serious. It sounds obscene but the taste is more obscene than anything you can imagine. Yes, even you. Not me. But you.

At first I thought this was a place where they serve Paella, suckling dead baby pigs and Bulls. But that's actually Madrid Pastries. It's also not the place with the really snobby servers and high prices (Paris Pastries), or the place full of lunatics that think their island is a ship that can set sail for North America and finally be reunited with the rebels (London Pastries).

What to get: Loukamades - Greek Honey Balls. Er.
Did you say... Honey Balls...: Look just get them okay. Order them in Greek if it makes you uncomfortable.

Anything else: Galaktoboureko (custard pie) and Spanakopita (Spinach Pie) are both really good. Those Greeks love their pies, don't they. And their honey balls. Well.

Literally one of the best desserts you will ever eat in your life. Loukamades.

These balls are seriously sticky and seriously perfect. I can't describe them. You have to come up to Toronto - right now - and try them.

Probably the only sweet thing in Toronto that is better than the amaaaaazing Créme Brulée donuts at nearby Von, these Honey Balls are some of the best Balls of any kind I've ever put in my mouth. And that includes all kinds.

I mean, including Falafel Balls and Arancini Balls. What did you think I meant? Ew. Come on. Really? I would never.

(Fingers Crossed Behind Back)

The long line for pastries is not always dealt with efficiently (it would be at Berlin Pastries), and sometimes I wonder if some of the servers are high on something (but then I remember, that only happens at Amsterdam Pastries). That one tall blonde girl that used to work here was pretty amazing (until she defected to work at Stockholm Pastries). And I like that they always open right on time, always close right on time, and execute all of their rivals (oh wait that's Moscow Pastries).

I first tried them during the Danforth St Festival aka Taste Of Danforth. They were packed out the door and also selling them outside. They were soooooooo good, and so much better than anyone else who was offering them. Accept no substitute! You must get them from here! Get your Gyro at Messini and your balls here at Athens!

Young boys follow me outside this bakery on their mopeds and hit on me, much like at Rome Pastries. It could be worse, because their baked goods could taste completely neutral and bland, like at Bern Pastries (and its sister stores, Geneva Pastries and Zurich Pastries). And I appreciate that even when all the customers are drunk, the servers never are (unlike Dublin Pastries and Belfast Pastries). The honey balls are only wee little balls lassie but they're bloody good (so says the baker over at Edinburgh Pastries). Anyway I have a multiple-person date to go on now (with the girls from Prague Pastries, Budapest Pastries, Bucharest Pastries, Tirana Pastries and Sofia Pastries, if you must know).

And if you feel (like those girls often do, which is how I met them) like showing it all off at the festival, New Orleans Style, then you can also pick up some Athens Pastys from Athens Pastries.

Their Spinach Pie here is also really good, but nothing compares to those balls of heaven. They put the \"ho\" in Honey. In a good way. Or is it put the Honey in Ho. Oh no that's something else. Never mind.

Did you hear, by the way, that Istanbul Bakery is trying really hard to get into the Bakery Business? But the other bakeries aren't sure if they want to let them in on a slice of the pie... so to speak.

Sadly, I found out that the store is completely bankrupt. And now I finally understand why they are named Athens Pastries."}
{"text":"This is the only place one should ever buy the deliciously, plump and fresh loukoumades (honey balls).  
$3 for dozen
Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious loukoumades and baklava...my mouth is actually starting to water a bit just thinking about them..."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years but the other day I ordered the spinach pie and it was lousy, the pastry was heavy and oily and hardly any filling. Apparently they're not made on the premises. Also they've gone from $3.30 up to $3.75 more money with less filling? I hope this isn't a trend because usually the food there is great. You also want to go when there's more customers, so the stuff isn't sitting for too long.

2nd time; It's happened again, with the tiny amount of filling, they need to start dealing with their supplier. 

Many times now; One other point, the paper towel dispenser in the bathroom has been improperly filled so that you can never get the towels out and it was like that for months. How were the food handlers washing their hands?"}
{"text":"Ahhhh! Delicious! Loukoumades are fantastic! Better than any homemade ones friends and family have shared with me. Cheese pies are great too. 

Staff are pleasant but snarky if you don't know what to order. 

Cash only! Bank across the street!

This location is very fresh compared to Victoria park!"}
{"text":"The Loukoumades (honey balls) is one of the great desserts ever. A dozen for $3.50 is maybe the best $3.50 you can ever spend. This place is clean, friendly, and smells wonderful. I could never drive into Greektown without stopping here. Coffee and other pastries are great too, and they have savory pastries like spanakopita as well but I haven't tried them. Two things to remember so your expectations are met: cash only and the place is nut free so no baklava."}
{"text":"Beside the infamous Johnny's Burgers, the Esquire Plaza in Scarborough houses some great late night eats and savory treats.  Athens Pastries is a cute little cafe that's been here for years serving some Mediterranean inspired desserts. 
They've got a second location in the Toronto Beaches neighborhood but this one is the original.
The venue is clean, presentable and at times can get quite busy as their known to their Greek inspired desserts. The staff are sweet and quite helpful.  
Coming here with JC we decided to TRY and keep it light and healthy...hah! Being on the safe side we decided to order a dozen of their Loukormades, Greek version of Tim-bits that are dipped in syrup.  Beware, it can get pretty sweet and messy but nonetheless delicious so don't bother to count your calories intake or else you'll be amazed. (4.5/5)
In addition to these little Greek Tim-bits I couldn't resist their galaktoboureko, a Greek semolina dessert, flaky on the top but soft inside. (3.5/5) the dessert was great, but not too fond of it. 
To wash things down I opted for a cup of espresso...pretty good place.. ill be back.

Overall, great place serving some good desserts on a SOLID 4/5!"}
{"text":"My favourite place to go for a desert. Love it. Most delicious and melt in your mouth loukoumathes (honey puffs) other custards are super delicious as well. Any time I'm in the area I try to stop by to enjoy some greek pastries."}
{"text":"I come by here for the loukoumades everytime I'm in the area. 
Dare I admit my cravings for these babies makes me make the extra trip? 

What are these magical goodies you ask? Loukoumades are basically honey soaked dough balls which are firm (fried) on the outside and spongey on the inside  and are literally heaven in your mouth.

I buy a dozen for $3.5 (HOW SO CHEAP)  and always regret not getting two. I always get it with cinnamon which which bring joy to the next level. The spinach pies are good as well but the loukoumades steal the show overtime. 

Wish they accepted cards though, that would make the experience even better."}
{"text":"Their food and coffee was good but I had too many coffee grounds at the bottom of my Greek coffee.  The pastry was flaky and crispy. It was good but not sure about the 4.5 stars it's gets. Good service and quaint cafe."}
{"text":"i know i know, no need to update with the same star rating...but after having just returned from Greece and having spinach and cheese pie there, I'm forever more convinced that pastries here are the most delicious versions of these of all time.

xoxo.
That's all."}
{"text":"Lokomades (sp?) are was too sweet in my opinion
The spinach and feta pies are delicious! Pastry is so flakey and filling is so yummy. The portions are very generous!"}
{"text":"Athens' specialty is patties filled with good stuff like meat, spinach, or custard. Buying a meal is really quick (similar to food courts); the food is filling and inexpensive. Although I often don't like spinach, they managed to make a spinach and cheese pie taste quite good!"}
{"text":"Came here the first time today after walking by previously.  

I think I've been here before during the taste of the danforth a few years back.

Had the spinach pie, very nice and was warm.  Each slice is $3.75 plus taxes.

Four different types of pies: spinach, meat (ground beef), cheese (feta) and custard.

I got the spinach and meat (going to try it later).

Honey balls are 12 for $3.50

They keep heating up pies so, yep the ones on display are probably fresh!"}
{"text":"Loukamades are the best! Especially when they are fresh! You get a nice crunch and then all the sweetness and flavor explodes in your mouth ;) Yummy!

Keep Eating, 
Angela"}
{"text":"Great food here, all the baked goods they make taste fresh as well as delicious, they have several Greek pastries such as cheese pie, spinach pie, custard pie, meat pie, baklava and honey balls. I think every single one of them is made the way it should be, I myself prefer the balls and the spinach pie. They also have several coffee's available for sale and I have tried all of them and they are excellent.

Another bonus is that they are open until 11 pm everyday (or almost everyday), making it a great place to stop by for a bite late in the night. By far one of the best places to go for cheap, amazing Greek food on the danforth."}
{"text":"This restaurant is cafe style where you order your food at the counter and take your tray to find a table. Their menu is short and all the pies look delicious. My friend and I settled on the meat pie, cheese pie and custard pie. It was filling, but we decided we couldn't leave without trying the spinach pie and honey balls. One word of caution, the honey balls are soaked in a sweet syrup that was too sweet for us, but everything else was very very good. My personal fave was the cheese pie and spinach pie, meat pie coming in close."}
{"text":"Can you say, \"BOUGATSA\"?  It's SOOO  GOOOD!  Sprinkle on lots'a Cinnamon and Icing Sugar please!!  Love it!   Loukomades are great too.....need to be a bit warmer.  Could have been bad timing on my part.  Get'm while they're HOT!   I have been here often and will continue to go every chance I get."}
{"text":"I can't pass this place without buying a Spanakopita (spinach Pie) and stuffing it into my mouth as quickly as possible. As good as the best I had in Athens.

Not much more to say here."}
{"text":"I love the loukoumades here, especially when I'm looking for a hit of sugary pastry after some great Greek food in the area. You might as well go to the source and have it drenched in honey!! These little balls of pastry are dense enough to hold up to the honey onslaught while giving a great al dente feel. Not a bad treat at a dozen for 3.50!! Better than timbits.  

There are plenty of other treats if you aren't into anything too sugary. I've had the spinach pastry freshly baked from the oven and it was delicious also."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about the honey balls here (I believe they are called Loukoumades). Everything from the spanikopita, the lovely Greek gentlemen chatting in the back, to the window display that immediately made me salivate upon viewing it, makes me happy about this place. It isn't expensive, it's authentic Greek and it's laid back. It's a great place for a coffee, quick bite or to pick up amazing loukoumades to bring home to your loved ones!"}
{"text":"I grew up on the Danforth and loved this place. Fast forward 10 years and I'm back in the city, driving the Danforth and looking around to see what I recognize. I practically did a little jig when I saw Athens was still here!! Their cheese pie is amazing and exactly as I remembered. Perfect, fluffy, crumbly pastry and the cheese is so, so good. I'm in heaven."}
{"text":"Delicious desserts but the staff is surly and who this day and age accepts cash only?!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the custard pie. The one that is not too sweet is the one I tried. Delish!"}
{"text":"Tried the Galaktobouriko since this was recommended by everyone. Tasted great and goes well with a cup of mochaccino. I don't really drink coffee or any coffee related drinks but the mochaccino here has totally changed my mind. Awesome flavor and the top foam layer gives it that icing on the cake quality. I can't wait to come back here and since its so close to where I work I'm pretty sure I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Galaktoboureko (custard pie) was amazing! Saturated with honey but not too sweet, pastry was crispy and delicious. Open late! Can't wait to go back to try everything else."}
{"text":"Freshly baked cheese pies to die for! The pastry is crisp, flaky, and soft inside and the cheese is delicious! $3.50 gets you a pretty big piece that's great for sharing. The spinach pies and Greek timbits with honey also looked fantastic! Yummy pastries, cheap prices, and a cute little patio out front -- I would definitely stop by here again next time I'm in Greektown."}
{"text":"Daaaaammn this is good. Came for a \"quick iced drink\" on a hot spring day. Got iced cappuccino ($3.85) and spinach pie ($3.85?). After finishing that amazing pie, got honey balls to finish with my sizable drink. Got a cheese pie to go.

Large portions. Amazing taste and quality. Fantastic price. The whole thing cost me $8.70 + $5.90 for medium iced capp, two pies, and 6 honey balls.

Fantastic! Can't wait to bring more ppl next time. Super casual but clean place.


5 stars out of 5.

Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food:
[*] Disappointing. Just...no.

[***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality. 
[****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints. 
[*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"Been here a total of somewhere between 5-10 times I guess, all for take out. We've only ordered the loukoumades (honey balls), the cheese and spinach pies...all very tasty and offer fair value for the price. The girls working there could really use a lesson in customer service though. They aren't very friendly, and at times it feels like they think they're doing you a favour by serving you rather than you're doing one by patronizing this establishment. Now I just get in and out, don't bother even saying thank you because it falls on deaf ears. Despite the attitudes I feel the items I mentioned are good enough to warrant the 3 star rating, I would give the staff 0 stars though. If an alternative were to open I'd probably stop going here."}
{"text":"I had my first taste of loukoumades here, and I think I know what heaven is like.  Very sweet, warm, and succulent.  I made the doofus mistake of biting into one, which resulted in honey squirting all over my shirt.  That's when my friend informed me that I should eat them whole.  Having a sweet burst of honey in my mouth is far more enjoyable than all over my shirt, that's for sure.

The shop itself is very clean and welcoming, and the staff couldn't be more friendly.  Cash only!

Looking forward to returning here when I come back to Toronto!"}
{"text":"I need to come clean - I know the owner from high school A LONG TIME AGO in case someone can pin this review on me ;-)

Having said that I have introduced enough people to the spanokopita, tyropita and loukoumades from here to know from their reaction that this place is the real deal. Everytime we go to a gathering where people want us to bring something, inevitably we are asked to bring food from here. Like every time - it has gotten embarrassing the amount I buy from there. At one point my daughter wanted us to pack spanokopitas for her lunch EVERY DAY. 

We have a friend from outside Canada who, when visiting calls ahead and NEEDs loukoumades arranged (either by going there or us bringing when we meet). Another friend has nicknamed the loukoumades little golden bits of heaven. Be careful though - they are addictive and beat donuts hands down. If you like sweet they are a must try.

Ok - enough said - I now need to go and get some loukoumades before the lines form there.

BTW - bring cash, credit cards are not accepted since the totals spent are usually small."}
{"text":"This place is sinful. Be careful, if you try it once, you'll want it more! The boreks aka phyllo dough pitas stuffed with spinach, cream, meat or cheese are simply crispy and delicious! The interior is nice, although there is no table service. Not suitable for big groups, no space for strollers or high chairs. Quick service, great for take-out orders. Yum"}
{"text":"Spanakopita and tiropita are very good. The phyllo is perfect, although personally I think there is too much filling.

The loukamades are really dangerous. They're not too heavy so you can eat a lot of them without realising it!"}
{"text":"Had an hour to kill in the area and found myself right at the storefront. Parked and looking up a new place to try. To my surprise, I was right in front one of the highly rated places! 
I had the spanakopita and the loukoumades! Both were amazing. The spanakopita was flaky, with a hearty portion of spinach and cheese. It was slightly hard and a little tough/chewy at some ends but that was probably because it was evening so I think if it was earlier during the day, it would be better. The loukoumades... Oh my - pure gold. A slightly crunchy exterior which is glazed and topped with cinnamon + a soft and gooey centre that's not too sweet or heavy. 
Highly recommend for a nice treat/snack if you're close by. Will look to try out the coffee and other goodies!"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favourite spots in Toronto. A simple menu of consistently amazing food at reasonable prices - you can't ask for more than that. I've eaten at Athens hundreds of times over that last 20 years and it's always phenomenal.

Athens serves a variety of \"pies\" (filling wrapped in several layers of phyllo pastry): spinach (spanakopita), cheese (tiropita), and custard. All are absolutely perfect, just the right amount of filling, amazing phyllo with great texture, not greasy at all, and less than $4. Have the cheese and spinach to start and the custard (with sugar and cinnamon) for dessert.

And, you can't walk out of Athens without trying their honey balls (loukoumades): tender, sweet balls of dough soaked in honey and dusted with cinnamon. An Athen's honey ball was the first solid food I ate as a child and it's still one of  my favourite foods ever. At $3 per dozen you can't go wrong. But, be warned, if you got late in the day they often run out of honey balls."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for all things Greek and baked! The Loukoumades are in the running for my favorite dessert, ever, on the planet. Their savory pies are fresh, flakey and fantastic!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite snack places in the city, hands down.  Great little pit stop if taking a long walk on the Danforth. 

VIBE 
A little bit Greek, a little bit not. You've got a sit down in the back. Nothing special on the paint sponged walls but I like that there is that option. I love the little patio in the front. It's perfect for people watching. The trays make me feel like I'm in a cafeteria and I forgo them because they're usually bigger than the patio tables! 
Service is hit and miss. It's very \"next\" because there's a lot of take out service here. Cash only. 

THE GOODS 
Oh man. it's all about the spanokopita (spinach pie for me). The phyllo is pretty flaky. I feel like it's deteriorated over the years but overall, it's still a great snack for $3.65 after tax. Loukomades are great too but the galaktabourikas (custard pie) with cinnamon on top is to die for if you're in need of an insulin attack. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
There ain't no Acropolis here but the street food is as close as you're going to get to Greece in Toronto. Unless you have a Greek grandmother (any rentals out there?)."}
{"text":"Best loukomades you will ever eat! (Some kind of a fried dough ball covered in a honey syrup) I believe they're 6 pieces for 1.50$ best money you will ever spend. If you're in the area, even if you eat dinner elsewhere save the dessert for this place I promise it's worthwhile 

Ps they only accept cash"}
{"text":"Simply irresistible ! ;)

So delicious, so tasty, so fresh!!! Both locations I have been to have been amazing:  Danforth and the Beaches location.  

The Galaktoboureko is my favourite and I get it every time! Always incredibly tasting! YUM"}
{"text":"The honeyballs and cheese pies are insanely good and an amazing price. Just don't forget to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Nice small little place. The loukomades are like the honey glazed Tim bits in taste but have a little harder exterior and has a hiney-syrup inside

Greek coffee was good too

If you need to come do some work it's not too busy and quiet enough to allow you to be productive"}
{"text":"I love the savory pastries. Hands down, the best on the Danforth between Broadview and Pape. A trio of each with a salad solidifies the first course of a dinner party."}
{"text":"SWEET DELICIOUS STICKY BALLS!

A DOZEN Loukoumades for THREE dollars = cheap way to get fat very quickly!

Loukoumades are deep fried balls of pastry dough soaked in honey. Usually topped with cinnamon and sometimes sesame. 

Three of these will wreck havoc on your blood sugar level, so if you really plan to get one dozen, please share (with me...why not?)

Athens Pastries has a limited menu of delicious Greek street food. The phyllo pies (they have spinach, meat and cheese varieties) were all priced at $3.40 plus tax for a pretty large square. 

I sampled the spinach (spanokopita) and it was just right. Not too greasy. 

Interior is clean but sort of diner-ish, nothing fancy. (Food is served on plastic trays). The one lady working there was slightly grumpy and ignored/didn't hear me asking if I could buy a few loukoumades without purchasing the entire dozen. Oh well."}
{"text":"Athens bakery serves up some of the best phyllo pastries in Toronto. Their Galaktoboureko (custard phyllo pastry) is the best I have had in Toronto, and this square shaped piece of heaven has had me coming back to the Danforth since I was old enough to ride the subway on my own! 
Their loukomades (honey balls), are also quite good and cheap and I have heard great things about their spanakopita. 
Whether it's the fact that they're open a little later than everyone else, that they only do a few pastries (but do it damn well), or that they've kept a clean reasonably priced cafe over the years, Athens is awesome; check it out."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek deserts! 
Almost as good as Grandma (Yiayia) used to make. 
The Loukoumades are the best, soft and full of syrup, their always fresh! 
I would recommend going for some dessert here after eating your lunch or dinner at another restaurant. 
If you want good desserts you need to go to a dessert place and this one is it!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the spanakopita (spinach pie) here.The galaktoboureko (custard pie) is also great. I like to have them in that order as dinner, then dessert. The loukoumathes are always a favourite, too. Everything is super fresh and super delicious.

If you haven't been here, stop doing that immediately, and start going here."}
{"text":"This was probably the first authentic Greek pastry I have ever had. It was completely different from the mediocre pastries you get served at souvlaki places.    

The selection is quite small. Only three or four types of pastries but they are very fresh and delicious. The loukoumades or honey balls are probably the Timbits of Greek Gods. The galaktoboureko or custard pie was my absolute favorite. Creamy in the center, flaky on the outside and infused with syrup. 

I will stop by for the spanakopita to go with a bag of the loukoumades the next time I'm around. 

Cash only"}
{"text":"As I previously mentioned, the greek word for comfort heaven food is \"spanikopita\" (with spinach) or \"tiropita\" (with cheese). Layers of thin pastry, layers of butter filled with any number of things (but quite often cheese or spinach). 

In Albanian, we call it \"byrek\", and it is made properly, from scratch, by one single person in my family. Holidays and get-togethers often centre around the acquisition of this pastry gold before your cousins take seconds (I am usually the cousin in this scenario).

Anyway, my sister and I wandered into this place, and it was like entering Willy Wonka's byrek factory. Large ovens and pans with large slabs of the stuff being removed, flipped, cut, repeat. The sheer volume stopped us in our tracks. It was just so...plentiful. It seems these guys specialize in our drug of choice (along with a few other Greek specialities, like \"loukoumades\", the small fried dough balls in syrup), and they make it deliciously and from scratch (meaning they roll out their own phyllo dough to the approximate thinness of paper, as opposed to buying it in boxes), and did I mention in gigantic batches? If you are a fan, you shall not be disappointed, if not, then you've probably never had it before, and this would be a good place to start."}
{"text":"The best and most authentic spanakopita and Tiropita in the city of Toronto. Hands-down the best! I've been coming here for a long time and wouldn't go anywhere else. The Loukoumathes are incredible!"}
{"text":"I love flaky pastry.. and that Spinach Pie at Athen's Pastries (Spanokopita) tasted awesomely good... 

I always glad that sign language is universal, point, smile and pay and you will receive... Athens Pastries works with that same system... 

Imagine the day that if one cannot pronounce the name of the food correctly, one cannot eat... I will be starving in Germany and Greek for sure!! 

I think a certain yelper told me about another location of Athens Pastries in Scarborough.. that would be my next destination to practise my Greek food vocabulary!"}
{"text":"I usually not into Greek sweet... but the Galaktobouriko (don't ask me to pronounce that!) at Athens Pastries was excellent!! Not too sweet with just a touch of honey went well with the flaky shell and the egg custard!! 

Cappuccino was great too with the nice milk foam. 

The layout of the Athens Pastries in Scarborough is identical to the one in Greek town but of course a lot less busy. 

Just love Athens Pastries especially the whole stores was filled with freshly baked pastries from the oven!"}
{"text":"While this may be my first review, my expanding waist says this may not be my first time here! 
Athens pastries is great for two things - going in for an occasional snack of loukmathes (little balls of pastry dipped in syrup of the gods most likely) and meat /cheese/ spinach pies; it is also great for the 'what should we take to xxxxxx's place when we visit?' 

The loukmathes are delicious and quite inexpensive (I think it came to $18.50 for 5 dozen). 

They only accept cash so make sure to stop by the bank on the way in. 

They are consistent and never disappoint. Also, they are open quite late."}
{"text":"My companions and I visited for loukamades. Unfortunately (fortunately) Athens Pastries was out. We opted for the Galaktoboureko. A traditional Greek dessert made with a custard in a crispy phyllo pastry shell. The custard was not too sweet. the phyllo pastry shell was somewhat flaky. Great for sharing! Overall, it was a good bite!"}
{"text":"I always come here if I'm on the Danforth. Always. For the last...15 years I'd say. They have the BEST cheese pies and spinach pies. Warm, flakey, study, not rubbery or dry. It's not one of those frozen pies from co- packers that other bakeries serve. Good portion size and reasonable prices. I really can't say enough about this place and was surprised I didn't have a review on this place. 

They also have these timbit-like things in syrup which my hubby loves. 
The drinks are good here. 
The service is also very polite. 
Clean washrooms. 
Nice atmosphere to grab a latte and share a pie with a friend to catch up on life etc."}
{"text":"I was stopping by the Philthy Philly's a couple doors down and saw this Athens Pastries on the walk over. I had had it bookmarked for a while and realized my friend and I just had to pop in! 

The girl who was behind the counter couldn't explain some of the items, and I think we had a bit of a language barrier between us, but I ended up ordering the cream-filled pastry before realizing they only took cash! The girl let me know there was TD Bank next door (luckily) and we quickly returned to buy the cream-filled pastry. She asked if I wanted it with the cinnamon and sugar on top (who says no to that?!) and after dusting it with deliciousness, and cutting it into smaller pieces, I paid my $4.05 and was on my way. It was a pretty good price for what I got. Make sure to get it cut if you want to feel like you're eating much more than you paid for! The pastry itself did not have much cream/custard in it, but was tasty nonetheless, and the cinnamon sugar on top was great as well!

I give the pastry 4 stars, but unfortunately I took another star off because the service wasn't so great. I would have ordered more but the girl legitimately could not tell me more about the items, and I didn't want to blindly order anything. There was also another girl who came out while I was talking to the first one and she seemed unfriendly. She spoke a little to the girl when she came out, but did not address me at all when she moved to the cash register to finish the order and give my change back to me.  If you have tried Greek pastries before, and know what's good, definitely go here! But if you're blindly stopping by, bring cash and order whatever is suggested in the reviews."}
{"text":"In love with this place. I drive all the way there just for honey balls and bugatza (sorry for my bad spelling)"}
{"text":"Every time I am on the Danforth in Greek town I make sure to stop by here and get two dozen Loukoumades (honey balls). 

They are absolutely delicious. Some of the best I have ever had. They are always made fresh and the ladies that serve them up are happy and friendly. They serve up the best in Greek comfort food here. Absolute must try if you are in the area! (Danforth & Logan)

The whole vibe of this bakery is awesome. 

5/5"}
{"text":"Consistently good Spanokopita! The location along the beach is also a great cafe.  Great coffee and the baked goods are amazing.

Try the honey balls!"}
{"text":"Strangest thing when you go near this place.....your mouth starts watering and your toes seem to move quicker! Everything is good in this place....I'm thinking of owning a restaurant some day and I will advertise their desserts on the menu....Spanakopita just out of the oven;\"freaken mind-blowing!\""}
