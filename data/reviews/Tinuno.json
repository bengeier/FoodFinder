{"text":"Filipino kamayan for an unbelievale affordable price! You can't ask for anything more. This is a hidden gem. Tinuno exudes kindness and passion to feed the mass. You'll experience this in their service and great food!"}
{"text":"Authentic Filipino Grilled food at it's best. Although extremely busy on a Sunday afternoon, it was worth the wait. Welcomed by a warm friendly staff, our food was served in the traditional style with banana leaves laid out on top of our table. The menu was set according to the amount of people at your table. The serving was more than enough. The variety of grilled food was fabulous, fresh and super tasty.

The over all atmosphere and concept of the restaurant gave us a feeling of sharing a wonderful meal in the true essence of our Filipino culture, which involves eating with our hands. We were totally engaged with the presence of each other and all the wonderful food that was set in front of us.

We left the restaurant feeling satisfied, the price was right, and it was truly a memorable experience and we couldn't stop talking about it on the way home. The best part is that you could take home your left overs from this all you could eat grilled experience. We would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants to try what true Filipino cuisine is all about.

We would advice to book a reservation.

Thank you TINUNO! Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Great food for a good price and staff was very friendly! Loved the garlic rice and how you taste the banana leaves while eating - feels like home! Will definitely come back again with Bebe."}
{"text":"The novelty of the experience took us to Tinuno. There was a short wait on a friday night but we got seated soon. Ordered the feast and it took 25-30 minutes to get made. Whole experience and the food good. One major concern were the fruit flies we noticed. We were kinda scared that we might fall  ill. Thankfully we didnt, so thats good. The servers seemed overworked but we were pleasant and friendly. Nice place with a unique experience but they need to sort their fruitfly problem."}
{"text":"Tinuno's is really a hole in the wall, except the last time I went it seemed to be flooded with more 'non-locals'. The restaurant hosts a Kamayan feast, where once you sit down, they will literally pile mountains of goodness in front of you. Primarily seafood, it features a host of their best - fish, squid, pork belly and unlimited garlic rice (shhh. not a lot of people actually know about this). The best is utensils are optional; if you choose to eat with your hands, you're the mainstream.

Highlight of the meal is that it only costs $15 before tax and tip. But I'd easily pay up to $20.
P.S. My impression is that you get a little bit more food if you go in a smaller crowd"}
{"text":"Nice to try and special dinning experience. But we wait for a long time until we get served even we made reservation ahead of time. And lots of flies in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went there and got the combo everyone recommends here, however, the pork was over done and it was chewy and the fish was extremely salty. The reviews here set up such a high expectation that the food was disappointing."}
{"text":"Incredible experience! Delicious phillipino food served in a traditional manner with friendly staff and great ambiance! We felt like we were in the Phillipines! No walk ins, call for reservations."}
{"text":"This is one of the best and well serviced meals that I have had in a long time. The smorgasbord of foods served on the banana leaf was incredible.  Seafood, fish, pork, okra, eggplant, mango salad in fish sauce, ... all for $15 including a drink and taxes. Incredible!"}
{"text":"Great value! $15 for a set course that is more than enough food for the average person. Most people we observed there didn't finish, and neither could we.

The experience was nice too. No cutlery. Just hands. This was our first Filipino food experience. We heard about Tinuno from a Filipino friend who dissuaded us from going to BlogTO's latest recommended Filipino joint in favour if this place. It was booked solid for dinner and even with a reservation we had to wait about 10-15 minutes for a table. Very busy!

The pork belly skewers were the first thing we tried and they were delicious. But things went downhill from there. While the food was still good, most of the seafood was overcooked (the shrimp was so tough that we couldn't even peel them, and I ended up eating shell and all, though it wasn't worth it) and the big slab of fish was burned -- the outside edges were nice and fatty, but the inside was dry and burned. Aside from the pork belly we really enjoyed the squid, but that was about it. Unsure if we want to visit again.

Our server was a but overbearing as well. I think he meant well and brought a lighthearted air to the place, but he was a mix of courteous and condescending... kind of strange."}
{"text":"Love love love this place, asides from the tasty food, the service is extraordinarily! One of our server (Miguel) has been helpful with distributing the food and patient with explaining the set up!!! 

5 stars all the way!!!"}
{"text":"...Probably the most fun I've had eating haha.

Tinuno is located just around the corner from Sherbourne station. The place was pretty packed on a Monday afternoon, but luckily we had placed reservations in advance (which I'd recommend, especially if you're coming with a group). The space itself is super casual, with an upstairs and downstairs dining space. Ambiance definitely isn't their forte, but if you're more of the \"substance over surface\" type of person then it shouldn't be a problem. 

We opted for the $15/person kamayan feast which contained a mix of garlic rice topped with squid, fish, BBQ pork, muscles, shrimp etc. The meal was great. Food was super flavourful, and portions were solid for a party of 6. Service was also friendly and prompt. 

If you're looking to try something new or just love Filipino food, then this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday with a large group of people sitting upstairs. All I can say was that it's a fun experience. 

Some of us got there on time and they told us that the food was already ready. We went upstairs and a lady assembled the table really quickly. It was mesmerizing watching her assembling all the food together. You can either eat with your bare hands or with gloves. Food tasted really good. I liked the mussels, the squid, the beef skewers and shrimp. After I was full I kept eating because there was food in front of me. If you ever go there, make sure you have the appetite of a behemoth ready to devour everything."}
{"text":"I feel bad for giving this 1 star as the food was really good, however I came here for the first time today and left with a pretty bad experience that left a sour taste in my mouth. I've been wanting to try this place for a while now and decided to finally try it with my boyfriend today. As we were waiting for our food to come out, a nice gentleman who I assume was the owner came our and told us that they were out of the grilled tilapia but offered to replace it with extra pork, shrimp or mussels. We were completely fine with that and opted for extra shrimp. Our food came out and half way through eating we realized we didn't get any mussels. We flagged down a waitress and told her we didn't get any mussels and she told us that mussels were extra charge so we said oh okay and she left. I looked at the menu display on that wall and it listed mussels as included in the $15 price so I thought it was odd, especially since extra mussels was one of the options offered to us to replace the tilapia. All of the Instagram photos I've seen of this place, there were mussels included. So we decided to flag down another waiter and ask him why we didn't get any mussels. He then told us 'oh sorry we were out earlier' so I said uhhh ok... And then he left. They did not offer to replace it or deduct anything off our bill. We ended up paying full price and my bf even still left a tip. However, I'm very upset because not only were we cheated but we were also lied to. The thing is we would have been fine if they had just told us from the beginning as they did with the tilapia, but instead we were cheated and lied to. We did not get tilapia or mussels with our meal and was still charged the full price as they brushed us off. Unfortunately, although the food was good, I will not be coming back as this completely ruined the experience for us. I never leave yelp reviews, but felt compelled to create an account just to leave this because it was really really disappointing. That's all I have to say."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend love to eat here.We love the kamayan feast,you don't have to think about what else to choose coz it has everything .We brought my mom here and she love it a lot.I feel like I'm just eating at home,Home means Philippines.When you eat the seafood you can taste the ocean;It means that it's very fresh.The service is always good.The only thing is it's always full.I think they need a much bigger location .It's good ,$15 per person."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Filipino food, but I do love this place. Full of flavour, authentic, very reasonably priced and amazing and helpful staff who are always happy to suggest new dishes to try. One of my go to places in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. You definitely need a reservation, especially if you want to go on the weekend. Very fresh and well priced."}
{"text":"Food is good but....the restaurant is a bit dirty, there is bees and flies everywhere...i recommend just to take out."}
{"text":"Tinuno's Kamayan feast is absolutely amazing. I've only been here once but I've been itching to go back since. Everything was well-seasoned and very tasty, especially the fish (and I am typically not a fan of fish served whole). The restaurant is the definition of a hole in the wall but this doesn't matter at all as the food more than makes up for it. The staff were friendly and accommodating, but seating is very limited so try to get a reservation rather than just walking in."}
{"text":"Tinuno is a Filipino restaurant that serves food in the Kamayan style or \"eat with your hands\" - no plates or no cutlery - just an array of grilled food served on banana leaves. They give disposable gloves so, if you prefer, you don't have to use your bare hands. They offer a unique Filipino experience that includes seafood (shrimps, squid and mussels), freshwater fish (Tilapia), meats (beef and pork) and vegetables (okra and eggplant). In the Philippines, this type of food is called the Boodle Fight - a Philippine Military Academy tradition where cadets would gather around a long table full of food and rice is spread over banana leaves and eaten with bare hands. It's a free for all as cadets attack the food until it's all gone.

Tinuno is a small cramped, no-frill busy restaurant but their service is fast ad friendly. The cost per person is C$15.00 and includes a bottle of water. While there are other Kamayan style Filipino restaurants in Toronto, Tinuno one of the most reasonably priced ones. The place is very busy on weekends so be prepared to wait for a table even if you have a reservation."}
{"text":"Kamayan was awesome. Went with two friends earlier this week and booked another reservation for father's day today because it was sooooo delicious. I can't wait. :D"}
{"text":"Went for a dinner with two friends. If you don't want to avoid noise and crowds, get there early. We got there before 5:30 and there were empty seats and food came out relatively fast too. But by 6, no seats left and people were literally waiting outside.
Staff were friendly and food was good (rice/meat/seafood/veggies/mango salad). I generally like bbq, so no complaints here. I didn't find the food overly salty or fatty so that was bonus.
You can eat with bare hands but they do give you disposable gloves if you ask for it.
I would come back here again."}
{"text":"It was good. Not a wow. Fish was over done and the burnt char was the main taste. Didn't see service come around till the end of our meal."}
{"text":"Tinuno is a super small Pilipino joint that's pretty busy so make sure you call in to make a reservation if you're a group of 4+. 

We had an extremely large group of around 13 people and ordered the Kamiyan Feast. The feast includes; tons of rice, a few different types of fish, mussels, pork belly, squid, roasted eggplant, okra, along with some other stuff that I can't remember (there was so much), all placed for you to eat with your hands on banana leaves. 

There was more than enough food for everyone and  we took a lot home. I wished they would have added more of the pork skewers because I definitely thought that that was the best piece of meat. It was tender and delicious! Not to say the fish was bad because it was also really flavourful, it was just that there was a TON of it. I guess that's just how the feast is so not going to knock them for that. Make sure you like seafood if you come here though (in specific fish). 

Although a shady looking spot, Tinuno is a spot to try if you're looking to try a new cuisine. Come with a big group and get the Kamiyan feast! 3.5/5."}
{"text":"The Kamayan feast lived up to it reputation. Great variety of flavours across the meats that don't overpower the natural tastes. Best of all it won't break the bank. $15 is a bargain!"}
{"text":"My first time having Filipino food. My friends and I had the Kamayan feast, I think they basically just serve you this. My friends arrived earlier than me and they said after they sat down, they didn't order anything but the food came. 

There is a sink outside for your to wash your hands. I really enjoyed the food and the experience. The portion was good for 4 people. So we got 2 milk fish, 1 tilipia, 1 squid to share among 4 people. There were pieces of grilled pork spread out the setting. Each person has 2 mussels, 2 shrimps, fruit (mine was shredded mango and slice of orange). Definitely would go back. It's $15/person for the meal and water bottle."}
{"text":"I organized my birthday party there at their upstairs party room for 24 guests.

Food was delicious and servings were generous - all for only $15 per person. My favourite was the pork belly and many people loved the garlic rice.

The main downside was despite having a reservation I had to wait for about half hour for the room to clear up. However they did try their best to make up for it by giving extra rice, free ube ice cream (very yummy) and allowing us to stay in the room until closing, which gave us about 2 hours + They also did place the food order while we were waiting so the food arrived quickly once we were seated."}
{"text":"I really like their boodle fight meal! It comes as a preset meal. You get garlic rice, okra, eggplant, mussels, shrimp, calamari, tilapia, another type of fish (that I didn't eat so i don't know), pork belly inihaw (grilled), and pork BBQ. We went as a group of 6 people. The food was really good.. Special mention to the garlic rice, calamari, and pork belly. The garlic rice was just right, not too oily and it was flavored enough. It didn't taste like it had MSG in it. That calamari... was giant! It was so satisfying all on its own even without the other ulam(side dishes). It was still soft, not chewy. And the pork belly didn't have too much fat in it and it definitely didn't have a \"mapanghe smell\"(...\"pee smell\") to it. I notice it when restaurants serve pork like that.. Some people don't but my mom was absolutely strict about selecting meat when she goes grocery shopping. I definitely recommend dipping the pork belly in vinegar! That's the way to go. I give this place a 4-star because of service. Two things --- first thing was we were asked what drinks we wanted...half of us wanted mango juice and the other half wanted water. We were asked tap water or bottled water, we said tap. The juices came and the food came, still no water so we asked again. Waited a bit, already in the middle of the meal, still no water. So we asked for water 3rd time, this time, (a different lady) asked if bottled water is okay. We said said yes, and it came right away..hmm. The second thing was we said that one of us had an allergy to seafood so they were nice enough to leave the pork BBQ and pork belly in a container separate from the table as to not touch the seafood. But the amount of non-seafood and pork that they gave us was literally the same. They didn't even give the person with allergies more pork. We literally had to order (and was charged) for another order of pork belly. Would still go back because it's hard to find a good kamayan place for that price, but if you have seafood allergies, go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Coworker recommended this place, so went for the first time with husband and daughter for hubby's birthday on May 17, 2018. Green P street parking on Howard and it's $2/hr or $6/3hrs. Made dinner reservations for 6:30pm but arrived early. Thankfully they accommodated us. It's fixed price per person and they don't serve alcohol. Our daughter is 9yrs old and she was full price, though she does not eat the same volume of food as us adults. Generally, restaurants would charge adult price starting at age 13; one reason why I rated this experience 4/5. Husband and daughter enjoyed the \"meat-on-the-stick\" and husband was impressed with the milk fish, especially since it had no bones and eaten with little effort, and tasted yummy! First time husband has seen okra not slimy, so he enjoyed it. Seafood also consisted of 2nd type of grilled fish, 6 pieces of mussels (pretty large!), and a scattering of shrimp. A grilled large octopus was also part of the meal, but it was rubbery and tough; it factored in the 4/5 rating. Overall, an engaging experience, but I can't see us going again for another year or so; the novelty was satisfied. I would recommend the \"hands-on\" experience for anyone who have never had a whole meal in this fashion."}
{"text":"Excellent service! We came in an hour before closing on Wednesday as a party of
12 with a reservation. The server took us upstairs and told us we were welcome to use the speaker. There was another table there with us so we put on Childish Gambino. We finished around 9:15 and they told us we were welcome to stay as long as we liked. The other table asked to take the leftover rice home so our server went to the cupboard and brought back take-out containers.

Such a deal - $15 tax included for an immense amount of food. :)"}
{"text":"We stopped by around noon on Sunday, and were seated immediately. We definitely got there are at the right time cause 15 minutes later, there was a line out the door!
The service was a bit odd -- we were seated but nobody came to take our order, I think they just assumed (correctly) that we were there for the kamayan feast. About 15-20 minutes later, the food came! The pork belly and bbq pork were so good! I also really liked the squid! it was so satisfying to see so much grilled goodness laid out in front of you, ready to be eaten!

Overall, the value for the meal was amazing! They were so busy so service was spotty, but it's understandable. 
On the way out we got a turon to go (you'll see them on display by the cash). They are fried, rolled up banana desserts/snacks.. they are SOOO good, please please get some to go! When we were ordering, the lady asked how many we wanted, and we said just one. WRONG CHOICE. I could've eaten 6 ($1 each). PLEASE GET THEM! and then thank me later!"}
{"text":"We used to go to a Filipino place in Salt Lake to eat adobo, and we loved it. But this is a completely different Filipino restaurant. There is only one item in the menu and it's worthwhile the trip to Toronto. The kamayan dinner is an assorted and abundant amount of mostly seafood served on top of rice (and banana leaves for platters) to be eaten with your hands. Bottle of water is also added. Service is fast. There might be some wait, but not too long.

Btw, I never give 5 stars really. Here it's not just the food that is good, it's also very exotic and unexpected. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"This is a definitely a family, cozy styled restaurant, one of my all time favourite hidden spots in Toronto.
The garlic rice is a big bonus, alongside their grilled milkfish, my favourite part of the entire feast. If you've never had milkfish, it's kind of like a citrusy, tangy fish, awesome. With your grilled feast, they give you a carrot and mango slaw with some orange slices, to lighten the meal. 

Overall, it's awesomely priced, different from a lot of restaurants (you eat with your hands), definitely try to make a reservation if you can, but most importantly, try it out!

{"text":"This tastes like everything from back home! It was just so good - the bangus, bbq, and all the inihaw that was included ~ so good. My Korean friend loved it and enjoyed the kamayan. I wish they served Red Horse!"}
{"text":"Totally worth $15.  Go in (but be prepared to wait an hour or so in line), grab seats, help yourself to a complimentary bottle of water from the fridge cooler, and wait for the server to lay down a pile of fresh banana leaves right on the tabletop which will serve as both serving ware and dinner plates.  You won't really get to pick what you get, but it will be a heaping pile of rice, followed by mussels/shrimp/pork, which you'll dig into with your plastic glove'd hands.

Taste-wise, some of our fish was perfectly cooked while others were on the dry side, and to be perfectly honest it all started to taste the same by the end of the meal. But for $15, definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The 4 stars I'm giving this place is mostly for the unique dining experience and the authenticity of the food. That being said, while most items in the Kamayan Feast were delicious I wasn't blown away by the food.

The dining experience is simple - you sit down, your table is covered in banana leaves and your food is plopped in front of you to enjoy. All you need are some gloves and the courage to eat with your hands.

I was a huge fan of the grilled pork skewers and the rice (perfectly cooked and infused with garlicky goodness). The shrimp and squid were also delicious but I wasn't crazy about the fish.

I also strongly recommend making reservations because the line-up for walk ins can get pretty crazy.

The only other thing that bummed me out was the lack of a menu. I had read about all these other amazing items that people ate at this restaurant but I couldn't find them listed or written anywhere.

Overall, cool place to check out and great for groups."}
{"text":"Tinuno has such a laid back vibe and very friendly staff, makes me feel like I know everyone here, such a welcoming vibe. They offer home made style food, not fancy gourmet, but exactly what I always crave for, in incredibly affordable cost.

Initially I came to Tinuno for the breakfast and hot dishes, but it was too hard to say no to kamayan. Their kamayan is served in the most authentic and original form, straight to the point. Most of the food are lightly seasoned, which preserves the original taste of the ingredients. The bangus was my favourite, I find the garlic rice can be more garlicky. The value of kamayan here is absolutely over $15, I couldn't believe the amount of food that were brough to us, so much food we even had enough leftover for dinner. I could tell the owner just really wanted to make and share great food. I tipped more than I usually do to show support. 

If I wasn't so stuffed I would've gotten their turon and halo halo. Will definitely come back to try their breakfast and other dishes. I truly enjoyed my visit here and can't wait to come back again. Hopefully tinuno gets to stick around, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It doesn't look like much but the food is authentic and amazing. We got the Kamayan which is great for a big group of people. It's a place to eat with your hands, though they do provide gloves if you aren't a fan."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the kamayan feast with a few of my friends. Food was good for the price that you pay - $15 per person. The experience is fun so if you never had, I highly recommend to try it at least once. They give you gloves to eat with your hands but if it isn't your fancy, they also have cutleries available. All the sauces are self serve at a station. I liked how they already have bottles of water on the table ready for your party. 

Due to the hectic-ness of the restaurant, staffs do tend to forget things here and there. For example, we almost missed out on our reservation because they weren't organized. Also, not that it affected us but there were extra skewers being served around as they didn't know which table it was actually for. 

Overall, it was a fun experience and I loved the presentation."}
{"text":"This was my second time here, but considering how things went, it may be my last. The last time I was here, customer service was lacking, but at least the food was good. Customer service was roughly the same and unchanged this time, but at least my reservation details were correct and we were quickly seated without much dispute. The waiters and waitresses also made a decent effort at accommodating our food allergies and dietary restrictions (e.g., one of us was allergic to shellfish and shrimp, while the other two of us don't eat meat).

I didn't particularly like that they handed out a drink menu beforehand, and personally asked each individual what they wanted to drink before serving the food. When I came last time, bottled water was free; as such, I was a little surprised to see them now charging $1 for it. The mango nectars that my friends ordered cost $2 for a tiny thin short can.

The place is as cramped as ever, and was boiling hot - the steam from the kitchen, coupled with the humidity outside, made the confined space quite unbearable. That said, the washrooms and place downstairs are quite cool and modestly clean.

The feast was served, starting with a bed of their fragrant garlic fried rice. However, I was a little disappointed to see that the portions have shrunk significantly - the squid was extremely tiny, with only roughly 8 portions of squid rings. There were no tentacles nor head served. The fish was okay - but the smoked milkfish wasn't as fragrant nor rich as before, while the grilled fish was smaller and underseasoned. It was also heavily charred, but surprisingly not crispy. In fact, I daresay it was on the wet side. The boiled shrimps were also not deveined, and stuck quite closely to their shells, making them difficult to peel.

The first time I came, it was an interesting experience. However, it's sad to see that they haven't been able to keep the quality of food, and are now charging the same for less and lower quality food."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday. They charge 15$ per person but the server said they only prepare for a minimum of 2 people. Their set should have grilled mussels, shrimps, squid, tilapia,bangus, pork belly, pork bbq, few pcs of okras, few slices of eggplants, mango salad and a bottle of water is included. So for two people, you should get 2 bottles of water. By the way, rice is unlimited. There were 4 of us who ate but they served only 1 tilapia. I was expecting at least 2 pcs on the table since the server said each set was prepared for two. We were so hungry when we came that as soon as our food was laid on our table, we thought of ordering another set for two people. We regretted doing this. Almost all the new people that came after we've started eating were already served with their food but our last order (which was ordered few minutes after we started) was given to us 45 minutes after when we were already done. We ended up taking it home. The food tasted good.  I'm still giving them 4 stars because I want my fellow Filipinos to get better until they become the best."}
{"text":"One year old hole in the wall Filipino restaurant that naturally encourages family style eating with their $15.99 Kamayan lunch. We were 3 ppl and we ordered 2 orders.  The portion sizes were astronomical and the meal was very good. All of it was served on banana leaves where you just go dig in with your hands.  Even though we only asked for 2 orders, we were still unable to finish it. Would recommend if you want to test the waters with Filipino cuisine."}
{"text":"Different, yes. But plain as hell. Tasteless.

I guess it is ok the first time for the experience, but that's it. I won't come back."}
{"text":"Trying the Kamayan Feast/Boodle Fight: We had a group of 10 and called in advance for reservations. They brought us upstairs in a smaller room where there were 2 long tables. Another party was next to us where we were almost touching backs lol. However, we still had tons of fun eating with our hands and the food was FRESH and DELICIOUS! Don't even get me started with the Bangus (Milkfish). *drools* The mango salad to start was also refreshing!

They served us the food fairly quickly and by the time we finished we had so much left over! We've returned to this bustling resturant time and time again. And c'mon for the price too? It's definitely a favourite!

Overall this is a fun place to bring your friends to when you want to see them attempt to eat with their hands.. haha amusing. Conveniently located within a few steps from Sherbourne Subway Station - this is definitely a must-try!

The staff is ALWAYS friendly. Although they look overworked you can tell by their gracious smiles that they love to feed customers with their delicious food. Big love for these kind people.

Tips: 
- If coming from the subway line, get off at Sherbourne Station and EXIT at GLEN RD for the closest exit to Tinuno
- You can ask for plastic gloves to eat with
- Always call for reservations if you'd like to do the Kamayan Feast/Boodle Fight.
- Good luck trying to order the fried plantain in the evening as it will run out cuz it's YUMMY.
- When ordering take-out, you have to ASK for the special vinegar condiment and they will happily provide it in a small container.
- If you don't speak tagalog, you can say \"SA-LA-MAT\" meaning thank-you to the servers! They would appreciate it ;)"}
{"text":"I wasn't going to give this place a good review because the first time I came here, I felt the service was very poor, however, I realized it was just due to language barrier and the fact that they were at capacity. The second time I ate here, the service was better.

I've been to Tinuno twice for their Kamayan feast and it's amazing value for the portion and a very interesting dinner experience because you eat with your hands (though gloves are provided). The restaurant itself is not fancy and resembles more of a food court, however, the feast is delicious and the portions are very generous for $15pp. I've been eating the leftovers for the past week. 

Highly recommended experience!"}
{"text":"it's a fun experience, super popular, hard to get a table without a reservation
love the garlic rice and the milkfish!"}
{"text":"Fun experience for me to try Filipino food. Amazing food. Can't wait to back again with my friends"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and servings were generous - all for only $15 per person. My favourite was the pork belly and many people loved the garlic rice."}
{"text":"I would have given 4 stars if it wasn't for the service but this is a 3.5 review. 

The Kamayan feast is a great communal experience, it's the kind of feast where more people, the merrier. For $15 per person, you do get quite a lot of food. 

Reservations are a must, and if you don't make one, expect a long wait. The hassle about making a reservation is, you might have to call multiple times until someone picks up the phone. I don't think they are purposely ignoring phone calls, they are just busy and the place is quite loud. 

Even with a reservation, you may still have to wait a bit for your table to be prepared. I'm not sure if that's the norm here, but I felt it was a bit disorganized when my friend arrived a bit early and was told that our group of 7 people would be sitting outside, but then we got a table upstairs. 

A few things to note: 1) Tell the staff you want the Kamayan Feast in advance when making the reservation. 2) Pace yourself when eating; with no utensils to slow you down, you might be eating faster than you realize. 3) Gloves are provided. 4) Don't bring a birthday cake; although I checked prior if they allowed it, it's best to have your cake and eat it somewhere else. 

My displeasure started the moment when we were not (but almost) done our feast and the bill was brought to us. I get it; there's a line up and you want a faster turnover, but it's hospitality 101-- it's a gesture telling us you want us to GTFO. Our table eventually gets cleared and we had to remind the staff that there's a cake. They didn't light up the candle we provided, they just brought the cake to us the way we brought it in: still boxed and in a bag. Utensils and styrofoam plates were given, but no proper knife to cut the cake, just a dinky plastic knife. 

TL;DR: enjoy the feast. Don't bring a cake."}

For $15 per person, the amount of the food and the variety of food they bring to you is phenomenal. They are extremely busy, but all the servers are very friendly. They may forget about your request, but just ask again :)

Highly recommend to make a reservation in advance. Today the guy working there asked how my experience here before was and if they were too busy. It really sounds like they sincerely want to bring their customers a good experience. He was like \"sometimes I worry we overbook\" and \"we watch Yelp a lot\". 

So if you see my review, HIIII!!
(Also it would be great if you can haver beer here)."}
{"text":"Order in advance i.e. overnight or a day if you're craving for something specific like 'inihaw na pusit' (grilled squid). There will be days when they can get overwhelmed by a huge demand. Better be prepared than sorry."}
{"text":"Experience 4/5 because it was unique; Food and ambience 2/5 tldr: dry and salty 

Firstly, the neighbourhood is really sketchy and has a deserted feel even though its only one block away from Bloor Yonge. Theres nothing much nearby. 

We experienced the Kamayan feast for four people and I think thats the only option they have for dinner. They set up portions of mango salad which was literally mango and carrot strips and two slices of oranges. A free water bottle included. The base was garlic rice and that was my favourite part - it wasn't too greasy and I could really taste roasted mince garlic. The meat and seafood on top were really meh...The pork belly was 90% fat and 10% rubbery meat. The pork skewers were flavourful and saucy just like cha siu but the meat was overcooked and dry. They forgot to remove the inside organ things of the mussels. The tilapia was was extremely and unbearably salty and also dry. The two best things were this second type of fish and squid.

However what was most disappointing was that as a group of four, we got only one fish and squid...which is the same portion size for two people and six people? We still each have to pay $15 so it doesn't make sense to me at all."}
{"text":"I haven't even been here yet but I've already had a bad experience just calling for a reservation. It took them forever to answer the phone and when the lady answered she answered with \"Hello?\" I thought I called the wrong number cause usually a restaurant will answer with their restaurant name. Anyway, I gave her the details of my request for my reservation and she said \"okay bye\" and I said \"wait. So it's for when?\" To confirm that it was correct. She confirmed the details and rushed me off the phone. I am cancelling my reservation now. First impressions stick."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10. Portion size was good and food was flavourful

Service:0/10. Coming into the restaurant: no greeter or someone to take you to your table-- you literally have to go find him yourself. Took 40 mins for our food to arrive and I watched at least 4 tables who came later get their food earlier. One reviewer said that if you don't speak Filipino, you don't get your food and that is 100% true. I'm not being discriminating, just facts. At first I thought it was because I went with one other person as opposed to the usual 3+, but the table next to us also seated 2 (Filipino) and got their food within 10 mins. If that's not a slap in the face I don't know what is. We had to chase the servers for our food not once but twice. If you're Filipino or coming with a Filipino you'll have a great time but otherwise I would not recommend this place to anyone else."}
{"text":"This place was on the radar after it opened up. So with two Yelp friends in tow we decided to show up. Luckily we had made reservations well in advance which are highly recommended as most of the floor level seating was taken up by a large group. Several people were even turned away. The seating is very basic. We had already decided for the Kamayan (15$ per person). The minimum size for Kamayan is 2 people so solo diners might be disappointed (one can always order two) 
I haven't tried Kamayan style food before hand and my exposure to Filipino food is limited to mainstream items. They serve unlimited serving of mango salad and garlic rice. Both items are decent. As for the BBQ items well its BBQ for starters and done well for seafood (I didn't try any pork items as don't eat those but DC enjoyed them) The fish items and the squid stood out IMO. Shrimps and mussels were OK so were the egg plant and okra but at this price I don't expect much. They serve on a banana leaf and one has to eat with the hand. I can't really eat rice with my hand so luckily they provided disposable gloves which is appreciated. At this price this is a no-brainer IMO. They are easily accessible by TTC if one just takes the Howard street exit you can't miss it."}
{"text":"This is as close as you can get to authentic Filipino food! And for the price, my rating is even better! Definitely make reservations as it is a small space, but very busy."}
{"text":"great experience for great price! For $15/person it was a great deal. 

it is very seafood heavy so if you don't like fish keep moving... my favourites were squid, BBQ stick and mango salad.


Make sure to order the Turon for dessert! One of the best I had ever! It is sweet plantain wrapped in spring rolls wrappers and deep fried... Sooo good and only a $1 each!

so much fun in larger groups!"}
{"text":"Possibly THE most traditional Filipino restaurant I've been to. The Kamayan meal is easily a MUST-TRY, mainly because it's the most traditional Filipino meal experience, in my opinion. 

$15 plus tax (as of Jan 2017) per person (minimum of two people) is definitely worth the meal, because the food is freshly prepared and is ready by the time you arrive. Even if you don't finish what's on the table, you can take the leftovers home. There are a variety of grilled meats and vegetables that are included, in addition to having a heaping serving of Garlic Fried Rice (no extra charge) and a free pop or water (surcharge for Mango Juice or an extra drink, but it's still pretty awesome). It's available year-round, so it's possible to have Filipino BBQ in the winter (especially since it's Canada).

NOTE:  If you are worried about eating with your hands and such, they have bathrooms to wash your hands, gloves in case you are uncomfortable but want to experience Kamayan feasts, or cutlery (which is... well, I don't think they'll judge)

RESERVATIONS ARE (pretty much) REQUIRED for Kamayan feasts. Reservations are usually made a few days in advanced, but some are lucky to snag a spot on-the-day (however, I personally don't recommend this, just in case the night is booked out), but I can imagine that this restaurant could become more popular, meaning it might be harder to book a table. It's a pretty small restaurant, however the tables are normally moved around to accommodate large groups (there were two large groups of about 10). 

The restaurant also has a few ready-to-eat, cafeteria-style meals which don't necessarily require a reservation unless you plan to eat in the restaurant during dinnertime. They also have all-day breakfasts which can also be enjoyed at dinnertime. 

Overall, great price, great atmosphere, great experience, great food, and also, great service! I will most likely come back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"We booked a table for 4 at 7:30 pm, sat down at 7:40....waited for over an hr...it is now 8:45 and the food still hasn't come...definitely won't come back."}
{"text":"We came here for some fun and it certainly was eating with our hands! It's a ton of food and everything was delicious, all at a reasonable price. If you haven't been here, you definitely should try it out.

When we went it was crazy busy, we made reservations and still had to wait 30 min. As previous comments have mention, they also have unfair portioning depending on your group size. They also have a fly problem... so this isn't exactly a good place to take a date. It's a great place to go with your friends and have some fun. I would definitely return when I'm in the mood for some grilled seafood."}
{"text":"Great price for the amount of food and different selections of seafood. However, I find the food way too oily. Got heart burns for daaaaysss."}
{"text":"As someone who has never eaten like this before, it was very exciting! The space is fairly small and packed, so book ahead or be prepared to wait; the wait time wasn't so bad and I went with a group of 7. Service was quick and friendly. They provide you with water bottles (not good for the environment) and gloves as well as orange slices and mango salad on the banana leaf lined table.

We ordered the meat and seafood option which comes in a bed of garlic fried rice, mmm. There was plenty for everyone ($15/person) and we finished it off with ube ice cream ($1 each).

My only qualm is not enough vegetables (2 pieces of okra per person) so I felt pretty heavy after all the carbs and protein. I'd come back though!"}
{"text":"Going to this place and trying the Kamayan feast had been on my mind since I moved to Toronto... and despite the high expectations... I was not disappointed!!! What a meal!!!!

I really liked the fact that you eat with your hands and that the food is served on banana leaves, imported from the Philippines. The grilled seafood and fish were extremely tender, fresh and full of flavour. I enjoyed every bite. Even the rice was incredibly tasty - and everything was super healthy because it is grilled!

Something I need to say: do not expect nice decorations, classy service or to have a relaxing restaurant experience. The place is always packed, there is not a lot of space and the interior itself is anything but fancy... but seriously, this is about the food, and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Just ate here and it was a 4 people meal. It was so delicious and I completely enjoyed everything. I hate ocra but I ate that as well and it was great. I enjoyed everything and I loved the tradition of being able to eat with your hands and share it with friends and loved ones. Amazing. Simply amazing. :)"}
{"text":"Really good kamayan for a good price. 15 per person and it comes with fish, grilled pork, skewers, squid, mussels, shrimp, garlic rice and mango salad. Very good deal but its at the cost of the location. Not situated in the nicest neighbourhood, and the venue itself is quite small. But you really cant find a better deal for kamayan."}
{"text":"This place is straight up amazing. Must try.  

It's laid back, casual. They actually reserve seats, but it's very similar to a food court type of feel. You'll think you're in Asia.

Most first time visitors try their Kamayan feast. It's $15 a person, for a literal pile of food. Garlic rice, roast pork, skewers, fish, squid etc. It doesn't look like a lot, but it's a lot. I'm not a small eater by any means, and I barely finished. Judge portions accordingly... I would even recommend 3 portions for 4 people if some are smaller eaters. 

Big tip: They have a sauce section. This is where I discovered banana sauce. Why the heck is banana sauce red?! But this thing is delicious. Girlfriend practically soaked everything in this amazing dyed banana substance. It's the same sauce on the pork skewer. 

Big tip #2: Make. Reservations. 100%. You will not find a seat even at 6pm on a Friday.

Big tip #3: Their hand wash station is behind the payment counter. You get to walk into their kitchen and see their operations. I feel like it might violate SOME SORT of health and safety... but it didn't bother me. In fact, it was very interesting!

Absolute must try for an awesome, inexpensive food experience."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here.  I couldn't make it last time with my Yelp friends.  I felt very sad for weeks lol.  I love eating with my hands.  Ya, I'm kind of a monkey person who enjoys sucking her own fingers lol.  It's tasty though.
 
AMBIANCE (3 stars)
It was a very small restaurant. Each table and each person sat very close to each other.  We felt so warm lol.  It was small, and the kitchen was open and right next to the dining room so we could see almost everything. The food ran out very fast, and the place was always packed.  Even though we made a reservation, we had to wait for 5-10 minutes.  At first, I wasn't sure that they would give us the table because we had only two people at the time and there were two more groups of 6 people behind us.  Luckily after they cleaned up the table that just left, they gave us the table.
The downside of this place was \"NO WASHROOM.\"  SO please make sure that you are good at holding XXXX or just run to a coffee shop nearby lol.
 
FOOD (4 stars)
I love their food.  I love the experience. It was a KAMAYAN FEAST.  So, we had to fight for food!  Lol, We actually didn't fight though.  We were too nice, so we shared everything.  We were a group of 6 people, but our 6th member came late.  We already started eating our food.  
The food portion was small in my opinion. I have heard from friends that you may get a bigger portion for a smaller group of 2-3 people.  I agreed with them when I saw a waiter server food for two people!  However the portion wasn't too small, we all were full too.
 
SERVICE (3.5 stars) They were friendly, especially the waiter.  He was nice, attentive and helpful. However, it took a while to get our food.
 
PRICE (4 stars) $15 each It is a very good deal!
 
OVERALL  Impressive experience for a KAMAYAN FEAST! LOVE eating with hands~  Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back. We had the Kamayan feast for two ($15 + tax and tip, per person) and really liked it. The variety of food (BBQ pork, pork belly, shrimp, mussels, grilled calamari, various white fish, garlic rice, veggies, mango salad, and orange) was great, and each of the items was good to very good. The portions were enormous- we had leftovers and were still completely stuffed.

The service is quick, friendly, and helpful. The owner said he can make substitutions for menu items with a bit of advance notice- if you don't eat pork, call ahead and he'll make accommodations."}
{"text":"The concept, experience, the quality of food, price and presentation are all amazing. The service can be a bit slow and make sure to have a reservation during peak hours. It would get a 5/5 but it is a matter of time before other restaurants copy the concept and then I can fairly compare the quality with a standard."}
{"text":"A unique and wonderful lunchtime experience! The restaurant was almost full as we arrived, but our party of three were lucky to be seated quickly at a table with a big banana leaf as table cloth! What next? I wondered. What came quite quickly was a beautiful array of pork belly,  fish, squid, mussels, okra, eggplant, pork skewers over a bed of rice, with mango salad. A table of plenty - all laid out right on the banana leaf - no need for plates at all! We laughed and talked and ate with our fingers - wearing plastic gloves! It was great fun. When we had enough, the remains were removed by rolling them up in the banana leaf and taking them away. We had had our fill and had our fun - it was time to go for coffee and dessert at a nearby coffee shop."}
{"text":"Tinuno is a hidden little gem with the friendliest staff, and delicious food.

Three of us shared the Kamayan Feast. I loved eating with my hands, but was less fond of the smell for the rest of the night. If you're going out after, make sure to use the gloves. The fish in particular was outstanding. When I was washing my hands on the way out, one of the cooks asked how I liked everything. I told him I loved it and asked if there was a marinade on the tilapia. He said it was just salt and the fire, itself. I was shocked because that was some moist, crispy and delicious fish. 

This spread is a lot of food for a great price and I love the authenticity of it. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because they don't have any alcohol. I really wanted a beer with this feast. It was also very crowded and busy inside. I hate when people are standing like vultures behind my table. I know its a sign that the place is popular and that's very good for them. But me, I don't like crowded spaces. 

Tinuno is a solid bet for a feast with people who's germs you aren't afraid of. There's a lot of hand to food contact and for to mouth contact. I don't have an issue myself, but I know people who would be horrified at sharing a meal this way. They can stay home and Purell their hands.

Worth a trip for the yummy charred food and tasty garlic rice."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places (if not the best, IMHO) in downtown Toronto for Filipino food. Very reasonably priced, and authentically flavoured. The staff is friendly, and the place is clean. Definitely try their grilled menus (Liempo, Bangus (milk fish), etc.) with a side of Pinakbet (vegetables simmered in shrimp paste)."}
{"text":"I don't know if the real Filipino street barbecue are like this, but it looks really authentic. I love the way they used banana leaves to serve food and flavoured the rice with red onion, which turned out tasted really good. 

The chicken skewers were yum, so did the seafood, the fish were a bit over grilled but very fresh. My friends had the pork and they loved it.

Overall it's a refreshing dining experience."}
{"text":"Experience was new and we had the Cajun special I believe? 

Great for parties. They laid out a giant leaf and we shared all the food! Came with mango salad and freshly grilled seafood and meats."}
{"text":"Brought my team here for lunch and everyone enjoyed the feast! It's a fixed price deal if you get the boodle. There was fried garlic rice, grilled pork bbq, grilled squid, fish, veggies! It was such a great deal and a unique experience for my team. We had fried banana a.k.a turon as well for an additional dollar. Yummy!"}
{"text":"The kamayan feast is so affordable and it was a good experience overall. Owner came around for a chat and was very friendly. Our only suggestion is to improve wait time and food could have been warmer. It was a bit too close to room temperature."}
{"text":"First time here....food was great....waiting time was disappointing ..way too long...place was very small and packed, service was just ok...."}
{"text":"First time doing kamayan and I really enjoyed this place! We placed a reservation with 9 people on a Thursday night for 7:30. We got seated around 7:45. The place was packed, and there's an upstairs for additional seating as well. $15 for the whole experience is well worth it in my opinion. OH AND THE GARLIC RICE? SO GOOD. All 9 of us were really full, and we needed a take out container too. One thing that bothered us though was the fact that we had some seafood allergies and we wanted to separate the seafoods and meats on the table, which they did and were fine with, but they ended up serving both foods on the same plate while using the same gloves."}
{"text":"Hi yelper and non-yelper. 

Usually my reviews are consistent and rich with details. But this time, I will brake my usual way.

I can summarize my experience here for service, food, quality with only two words: ABSOLUTELY A-MA-ZING!"}
{"text":"I can be picky of each food but overall it was excellent. Highly recommended. If I live closer I would go there weekly. Amazing value. Great service. Can't ask for more. Love it."}
{"text":"Filipino dining doesn't get more authentic than this! Not that I would know..but I assume a place filled with Filipino people is pretty darned authentic. 

Incredibly fresh food, garlic rice that will blow your mind, and all for $15 per person! Incredible. Also, don't forget to try the ube ice cream for $1! 

This place was packed on a Wednesday, so be sure to try to make a reservation. A little sad that the place didn't serve beer or alcohol, as a beer would have beer would've been perfect with the meal!

Portion size was pretty good. Definitely left satisfied.I mean you get a good portion that consists of a chunk of fish, 1 pork skewer, pork belly, chunk of tilapia, 3 or 4 shrimp and 3 or 4 mussels. 

Oh and by the way, you eat with your hands on a banana leaf! Don't worry, you get plastic gloves so as not to ruin your french manicure."}
{"text":"We were headed to Toronto planning to eat somewhere else but those plans fell through.  So instead we found this place through Yelp and based off the reviews figured we would give this place a try.  Upon arrival the staff seemed super busy BUT were very polite and squeezed us in without any reservations.  Though they seemed to be running around so busy I was just glad they were friendly and said \"hi\".

So it seemed like you only had two  (2) options:  this feast where you eat with your hands or to order from what appeared to be a simple Filipino breakfast menu.  So considering we drove from the U.S. and were starving just ran with the feast which was $15 per person CAD (or at time of conversion when we went like ~$10 per person USD).

1.  Food was awesome being laid out with warm garlic fried rice over a banana leaves (which think of it like a plate but the length of the table), then fish, mussels, filipino stick bbq, mango salad, grilled squid, grilled veggies like okra and egg plant and shrimp.  It was a great size portion and you share all of it.
2.  Service again was simply awesome and people were kind and friendly

I would definitely go there again and refer it to my friends!"}
{"text":"What a feast! 

I came here with three friends for the Kamayan feast. Grilled pork, calamari, two kinds of fish, mussels and shrimp are served on a bed of garlic rice alongside green mango salad, all on banana leaves. You eat with your hands, though they offer gloves if you want. We are a messy and impatient bunch, so we didn't go for gloves. Everything was delicious, though I found the fish a tiny bit overcooked. The rice alone would get 5 stars from me.

The food came out incredibly quickly and service was really friendly. This is a small place, so reservations are recommended. 

This is a fantastic spot to enjoy a casual dinner with friends, or to take a first date so you can gauge how cool they are."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice and I still cant get over the value and taste. I definitely recommend recommendations as this is a local hotspot though it is really hard to get through at times. Ive done the Kamayan options which is a standard $15 for a whole range of items garlic rice, egg plant, pork belly, 2 types of fish, pork skewer (I think) shrimp, oysters and more. The portions are really good but if not enough you can add more at additional costs of course. The space is tight or \"intimate\" but it didn't bother me. The place can get rather chilly in the fall/winter as the door is constantly opening and closing. The food is full of flavour and will have you eating until itis kicks in. Must try!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is located in a pretty rough-looking neighborhood, and the front door and one of the windows facing the street is covered up with huge wooden boards. But I'm just mentioning this as an observation for those that may be concerned with such things, especially if you're coming after dark.

Inside, it's a pretty small place, with small tables scattered throughout the floor. It gets pretty cramped, with people walking in and out for take-out. Washroom is upstairs, but if there's people waiting at the doorway it might be a challenge. There's a fridge of soft drinks in the back, and water bottles on the ground nearby.

I placed a reservation for 8 seats at 7 PM a week prior. There weren't any confirmation calls or anything, so I assume things would go smoothly. We arrived about 10 minutes before the reservation and the place was pretty busy and it didn't seem like things were going to be ready. Which is understandable: reservation for 7 PM means as long as we get a table in the end - preferably around 7 PM - it's all good.

Closer to 7 PM, a couple tables had started clearing up (or rather, it looked like they were told to hurry up), so they started setting one up and said it would be for us. However, a group of 14 suddenly came in and said they also had reservations, and demanded that the table that was being set up be given to them because they wanted to sit together. Literally, they just sat down and said they weren't moving. Staff complied, and we were told to wait a bit longer. But to be fair, we should've been more aggressive, but I just take this as part of the authentic local experience and it wasn't really a battle worth fighting.

At this point, they had to get creative: they removed some of the smaller high seats that were meant for couples and then pulled out some more foldable tables for us. Two tables were placed beside each other so that there was enough room for our group. Seems like they've managed to get through this pretty easily, and it's only been 10-15 minutes after our original reservation time.

Now get this, ANOTHER group of 10 shows up and said they also have a reservation. At this point the staff looked like they were just panicking cause they clearly didn't have space for another large party. 4 more people came in but had to be turned away. The group was left standing around for half an hour, and were then invited to sit in a private dining room upstairs. Well, at least that was settled, but one of the girls in the group that looked like she was in charge of the party looked pretty upset during that long wait.

In the end, we had to wait an extra 20-30 minutes in total before everything was set up for us.
Of course, the entertainment provided was enough to pass the time for me cause you know, this kind of drama goes in my reviews, but I can only imagine if you were on a schedule it might not be as amusing.

As the feast was being set up, the server took the time to explain what each item was, and laid them out in an organized fashion.

Another couple had been offered a box of plastic gloves, but we didn't get any service there so I ended up just grabbing the box for myself. Well, self-service is probably part of the local experience so it's cool.

The food itself is great. The grilled tilapia and bangus (milkfish)  were amazing, the pork belly and shoulder were really tender and the seasoning they put on it was on point. Mussels, shrimp, calamari were well-done. Eggplant, okra, and mango salad were there. The few slices of orange was excellent. The garlic rice was also pretty tasty, though someone in the group mentioned last time there was more garlic sauce in the rice.

Near the beginning, we were informed that a drink was included in the cost of the feast, but when we went to pay we were then informed that the free drink applies to bottled water only, and not soft drinks. So we ended up adding a dollar on top of the $15 per head. It might only be a dollar, but 1) it's a regular can of pop, not even something more exotic like a filipino brand or something and 2) it just looks like they're intentionally withholding information that may influence one's decision on which drinks to pick.

Overall, if I were to only consider food and price, it would be at least a 4-star. Like, if everything went smoothly, you'd have a great time. However, I assume our experience that night wasn't an outlier."}
{"text":"What a feast! The Kamayan feast serves up a variety of meats, skewers, vegetables, seafood, and rice on a giant banana leaf. The staff is friendly and helpful. The pricing of the feast is per person and includes a bottle of water per head. You also have the option of getting plastic gloves to rummage through the pile of food. 

If you wanna give this place a try, make sure you call ahead early and let them know how many of you are coming!

Only downside: I'm pretty sure they don't serve people who eat alone."}
{"text":"3.5 Star

Truth be told: I actually enjoy eating with my hands and would have no issue if it became more of a social norm here as it is many places in the world. I was able to do a couple cultural exchanges in my early 20's and it's great to appreciate the experience, social aspect, and even ease of eating this way (depending on the food).

First off, a huge credit to the place is that it's very inexpensive - I suspect more so with a larger group. I think it was around $15 all in per person.

Regarding the food, I loved the rice and the various grilled fish were the highlights. It's mostly a savoury and seasoned taste you have from the meal. The pork belly and kebabs were pretty good. I found the shrimp,muscles and squid to be a bit overcooked. I'm sure it was fairly recently prepared, but since everything comes out virtually all at once it may have been cooked a few minutes by the time we received it, which affects the quality noticeably since those items don't retain heat too well - especially the squid. 

It was a great experience by virtue of eating family style with a group of friends in a comfortable atmosphere. Very good value with some pretty good items, though the food as a whole didn't necessarily awe me."}
{"text":"I really don't get why this place is so popular. The kamayan feast is super cheap at $15/person, but that's about it. It's cheap so don't expect the food to taste good. If you're a germaphobe or don't like sharing, this also isn't for you. I really didn't mind the experience. It was fun, but the food was horrible. My reviews are generally reviewed based on the food. And yes it's $15, but everything tastes terrible except the skewer. Also, if u go with a big group, you get a lot less than when u go with just two people. 

For a group of 8 of us, we were sat upstairs and were crammed into a table that should be for a max of 6 people. We received 2 calamari, 3 milk fish, 3 tilapia and each person received 2 mussels, 2 shrimps, 2 okra, a pork skewer and some chunks of pork meat and mango salad. I didn't even touch the tilapia because...well it's tilapia. The milk fish was so fishy I took one bite and didn't want anymore. The mussels weren't fresh, the calamari, shrimp and pork were all dry and the mango salad was bland. The only thing that tasted decent was the skewer because it was covered in sauce and I guess the rice, but how can you go wrong with rice?

The two stars are for the skewer and the service was pretty decent. I'm glad I got to finally try this place, but don't think I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I saw pictures of this place on Instagram so I just had to check this place out. I tried to call to make a reservation but the phone was always busy, so my friend and I just went and hoped we could get a table. Luckily, the place wasn't extremely busy, so we were seated right away (we went on a Sunday evening). We got the Kamayan feast for two and the presentation of the food was amazing! They gave us water bottles and gloves but we didn't bother using the gloves. I loved everything except the grilled squid, one of the fish (I think milkfish) and the mango salad. The squid was very rubbery and the milkfish was too well done for me but my friend enjoyed the fish. The mango salad didn't have much flavour but the oranges were good. We were really full afterwards haha. I would totally go back and I've been recommending this place to a lot of my coworkers."}
{"text":"I just adore this concept and type of Filipino cuisine! It's so unique and great for bonding with friends and family. For $15/head, the food is filling and tasty and not to mention, the staff is always really nice and accommodating to foreigners!

I've been here twice and it's definitely a place I would recommend to friends for the experience. I can't say the grilled meats, fish or seafood are \"high quality\" pieces but it's definitely worth the price you're paying. I particularly enjoyed the skewer of saucy pork and the mango slaw. Since it's a messy hands-on meal, they provide you with plastic gloves and bottled water for easy and sanitary disposal. 

This is definitely a cool place to check out if you're exploring the more authentic ethnical foods of Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Filipino food. You'll have to make a reservation a few days in advance to avoid the long wait. It's best to call around the time they open. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Don't look for chic and upscale. You get the true heart in the food. Wait staff approachable, but definitely on the move offering more garlic rice. All grilled items: milkfish, squid, mussels, shrimps, bbq chicken/pork, okra & eggplant. I gave 5 stars as it transported my palate & experience to what it was like to be back in the Philippines on a beach experiencing the same dinner. Wishing them much success."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fun, unique and family friendly experience, this is it! The food actually looks like the pictures you see on all the food blogs. Some of the grilled seafood were unfortunately a bit on the dry side. Go with at least 3 people to try everything from the $15 feast."}
{"text":"It's places like Tinuno that make Toronto... Toronto!  Feels like you're eating at someone's home.  

This little street is a hidden gem and a respite for all the Filipino service workers all living in St. James town.  Hopefully this portion of town won't get hipsterized and drive out their daily clientele.

If you can garner up some patience, this'll be a awesome experience.. if not.. then move a long.  Just pretend you've made some new Filipino friends and you've been invited over for a party and everything will be great.  All this party is missing is a karaoke machine, and then it'd feel real authentic."}
{"text":"Love the food. Came here on a Saturday without reservation and got a table for 2 within 15 min. It was raining that day at 3pm though. We got our food within 15 min and it was delicious! The place is very small and sitting was not comfortable but will still go back for the food."}
{"text":"We got the \"kamayan\", the traditional Filipino feast where you eat with your hands. You get gloves of course! 

The kamayan comes on banana leaves, with rice, okra, seasoned meat, shrimp, fish, muscles, etc. All for just $15. It is well worth the price, and only the rice can be topped up."}
{"text":"Omg this place is so good! I've been here twice already in the past 3 days. I've tried the feast for $15/person and the pork belly garlic rice with eggs. Both are delicious! Must try, you won't regret. Make sure to make a reservation if you come during lunch or dinner time since the place is kind of small."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Had the pork belly and the dessert roll, all for $7 and I will definitely be returning and recommending this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Remember to reserve a table if you're going here on a weekends. It was really nice of them to let us order just before closing time, which is at 9PM. Good price for a huge meal, we were 4 people and we paid a fair price for mouthwatering seafood and meat. I love the place cos I am a pescatarian and on the boodle menu it has a nice amount of fish and shrimp on it, they ran out of mussels but they added more shrimp so i guess it's alright. I get to enjoy my food and plus its fun to eat with my hands and on a banana leaves. Feels like I'm back home!"}
{"text":"Tinuno is small looking, that looks more like a takeout joint.

Kamayan feast $15/person and comes with a drink. Book in advanced for larger group since this place is small! The food is laid out on banana leaves. Each individual have their own pile of mango salad that was sweet and tangy and a dipping sauce (more condiment selection on the counter!). Quite a variety of meats and veggies that's on top of a big pile of yummy garlic rice (more fish selection than meat). Some items lacked flavour but overall the food was tasty. You can taste the grill flavour of the fishes!

Minimal service after they set the feast on your table.  

It is a cool experience where you eat with your hands and there's plenty of delicious food that will fill you at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem!!!! Super affordable and super tasty. It's literally a feast - must order the Kamanyan Feast where you eat grilled seafood and veggies and rice with your hands. Soooo good. There is a $1 dessert they sell at the counter that kind of looks like a churro (it's not) and it's pretty testy too."}
{"text":"Basically most of the reviews here covers it all. This was definitely an amazing dining experience. I've always been meaning to try it and I am so glad we came here today.

We got a lovely table outside and the price for all the huge portions was absolutely unbelievable. $15 per person and that includes lots of seafoods, veggies and rice (shrimp, mussels, tilapia, etc.) And it comes free with a bottled water, but extra if you want a soda, coconut water or a mango drink. The meal is pretty hands on and you get to wear gloves or there is also a sink located near our dining tables for you to wash your hands before and after your meal!

And also, the customer service is fantastic. They were very friendly explaining how this whole dining experience works, and they often would check up on us asking how we're doing. On our way out, we each got some ube ice cream which was only $1 a scoop and it tasted so gooood!!! Come on, where can you beat that deal? 

Even though today was just a Thursday evening, it was still super busy, definitely recommend getting reservations."}
{"text":"A delicious value Filipino feast! I wish the place was more spacious (it was a bit cramped) but not much can be done since the building itself allows for only so much seating. But other than that one factor, the service, price, and food was great. We did a walk-in on a week night and had to wait only about 10-15 minutes, which isn't too bad of a wait time. :)"}
{"text":"I love the authenticity of the place. Eating with the hands, the simple ambience, the mix between seafood, meat and fruits make the experience unique! 
The people are very nice and the price is very good for the amount of food you get. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to Tinuo as a group of four on Canada Day 2017. We ordered the Mayan Feast; I believe it was around 15 dollars per person, but I could be mistaken. We waited for about 15-20 mins when we got there, but that might be because it was Canada day.

The meal came with fish, shrimps, squid, mussels, pork belly, chicken skewers, eggplant, and okras--well enough to share amongst four people. The meal itself was excellent and tasted great, the down side though, is that you have to eat with your hands. They provide gloves for you to wear, but if you're not use to that kind of thing, it may feel a bit weird. The fish also came whole, so it may be difficult for you to pick out all the bones if you're not use to doing that."}
{"text":"the food here is A+ and I want to give it 5 stars but the service has been really bad. We called in to reserve a table and when we got there, the server informed us that we had to wait for the people currently at our table to finish first before we can get seated. 

We waited 30 minutes for this. Then as we were standing outside the server came and was like \"oh you guys have been waiting all this time?\" which was pretty unprofessional. So there's not really a point in making a reservation since you have to wait anyway. It's like they don't know how reservation system works.

If you dont mind waiting then i recommend Tinuno because the seafood, rice and price are all really great."}
{"text":"Went here for my parent's 25th anniversary, it was my mom's second time here and she wanted to come back for the occasion. 

Definitely make a reservation when you plan to eat here! Wait times are around 30-45 minutes. My boyfriend isn't too much of a fan of Filipino food (ironic cause he's filipino) but he actually really enjoyed the food and the experience. For the amount you pay per person, it's a very fulfilling meal. The staff are nice and funny, my mom couldn't stop laughing at some jokes (my mom is ilocano and she said the staff was ilocano too, haha.)

After paying, my boyfriend and I saw the sign for Ube Ice Cream for a $1.00 and we decided to get two scoops. It was a really great way to end our meal."}
{"text":"I'm so IN LOVE with this place! For only $15 a person, they don't try to cut costs like other places by adding too much rice or veggies to make up a large serving. It's a good amount of garlic rice piled with seafood and sweet barbecue pork, plus you can get additional rice for free. Ube ice cream is also only $1 per scoop. This portion was for 2 of us and I was beyond full! The wait for food was rather long (bout 40min) but it was so worth it!!! Hope they don't raise the price as they become more and more popular"}
{"text":"This hole in the wall Filipino restaurant serves kamayan (eating with hands) feast for $15/person including tax and drinks! It's honestly a really great deal for the amount of food that my boyfriend and I got. Altogether the bill came up to 30 dollars (tip not included) 

So the feast was served on banana leaves with various meats and seafood like pork skewers, a few mussels,  a whole squid, milkfish, and tilapia. They also put in some veggies like eggplant, okra, a mango salad as well.

If you are up for it, try the Sarsi soda. It's soda imported from the Philippines, and actually it sort of tasted like a bold root beer. Very interesting.

I came to Tinuno for that particular feast and it's a wonderful experience eating with your hands. There's something about touching your food that makes it satisfying. 

Tip: To eat with your hands efficiently, try to form a duck face out of your hands so that you can scoop the rice and meat easier from it. Not sure if I make any sense. Anyhow, definitely would come back for another occasion of kamayan! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"On a Friday, if you don't make reservations for table for 4, the waiting time is 1.5 hour. Your full party have to be present before they give you a table. 

My reservations is at 7:30pm, waiting for 3 latecomers, they told me to tell them upon their arrival. 

For the customers with upstairs seatings, there's no sign, you will see \"Neroli Blossoms Health and Wellness-A one stop health centre\" but you will soon discover as the waiter and waitress are opening doors and bringing the food upstairs. Anyways, as I waited, I directed a few customers up as they seem lost.

They place the banana leaf on your table and shredded mango and carrot slice. Each person gets two slices of oranges. 

They land a bed of garlic rice, there's a whole fish which taste very fishy. The fish on the side is better with the lemon flavour. There is squid, shrimp and mussels. Anyways, very reasonable for $15 per person. Good way to gather with friends!

(3.5 stars for food)
(4.0 for service)"}
{"text":"Surprisingly really good food for a very very small restaurant. I've been to a few \"kamayan\" or boogle fight restaurants and this is the cheapest $15 (VS $55 someplace else) and it includes a variety of food! The whole restaurant could use a little updating or maybe just need to strategize the set up otherwise very good!"}
{"text":"The food didn't taste nearly as good as I expected. For sure it's very instagramable."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night 6:30- family of 4 
Wait without reservation was decent, waited about 25 mins.

Food was served immediately upon seated?very nice garlic rice. The bbq fish was a bit over cooked almost charcoal burn.

Don't expect too much service, eat with your hand, small crowded restaurant. Their goal is to turn over the table as quickly as they can.


$15 per person - not a bad deal"}
{"text":"I really don't know how people are only giving this place 3 stars- it's AMAZING!! Tons of food (oranges, mango salad, two types of fish, calamari, shrimp, mussels, two types of pork, eggplant and okra, and garlic rice), all delicious, and such a reasonable price (15$). My husband and I couldn't believe how good it was!! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Fun place where it is widely acceptable to eat with your hands. 

This place resembles a Filipino fast food restaurant with a dine-in option. Expect nothing fancy or modern as it is run by a friendly guy who just wants everyone to enjoy good food. Decor is secondary. 

The kamayan feast (as seen in most pictures here) is served on banana leaves with a variety of cooked seafood (i.e. fish, squid, mussels), pork, garlic rice, mango salad and a cantaloupe. We relized utensils were available near the end of the meal, but the experience wouldn't have been as fun otherwise. For $15, this meal is a steal in Toronto. 

Make sure to make reservations beforehand as it does get quite busy during dinner time."}
{"text":"Saw photos of this place on Instagram, and having not really tried too much Filipino in the past we tried this place out. And it was awesome.

The food is a set menu, and it's a out $20 per person. Food was fresh and delicious. All the food is grilled and put on top of this bed of tasty garlic rice. The 4 of us almost finished our food.

Coupled with friend service, my wife and I will definitely be back. Just be sure to make reservations on the weekends because it gets packed!"}
{"text":"Delicious and satisfying Filipino food. Meals are all under $10 and the Liemposilog, which I ordered, was only $6 plus tax and came with a drink. Was my first time (recommended by a friend) and I will definitely be eating there whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Food was so yummy! Great service as well! $15 per person for the Kamayan style feast is a must try item on the menu. The rice was so delicious... couldn't stop eating the rice on the leaf!"}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to leave a glowing review (for selfish reasons) because as word-of-mouth about this hidden gem continues to spread, they'll become even more popular and busier, making it harder to secure a reservation! Fortunately for us, we were able to secure a reservation on a Friday night well in advance. Though when we got there, they weren't quite ready for us.

We obviously came for the Kamayan feast, and at $15/person, how could you say no?! The feast includes: 
- grilled milkfish
- grilled tilapia
- grilled calamari
- pork belly
- pork BBQ
- mussels
- shrimp
- eggplant
- okra
- mango salad
- garlic rice

And yes, garlic rice is included (and unlimited) and not an extra charge, unlike some other places (I'm looking at you, Casa Manila). The garlic rice could've used a bit more garlic for my liking, but my friends were pretty happy with it as is.

For those who haven't partaken in a kamayan feast, the food is presented on a table with banana leaves and you eat with your hands, though there are gloves and cutlery available as well. We used the gloves to eat our food and used cutlery to separate the food to eliminate any contact from our hands touching the shared food.

We were pretty satisfied with everything on the menu. I'm not a fan of milkfish because of the bones, but if you can get past it, it's pretty good. The rest of the menu stays true to traditional preparations and flavours so you can expect an authentic and filling meal!

I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I went here this past weekend with my family and we definitely all enjoyed! We were all so full afterwards! 

$15/person for the Kamayan experience was amazing! Our server was so nice and sweet! We had a party of 8 and we were all so hungry before our meal, and by the time we were done we were at the 'need to unbuckle your pants' full. 

The spread came with mango salad, orange slices, garlic rice, BBQ skewer, muscles, shrimps, grilled milkfish and tilapia, grilled pork belly, grilled squid. Everything tasted delicious! 

I went on a weekend and it was crazy busy but they were still awesome! I did make a reservation beforehand so I would recommend to do the same! 
I plan on coming back and bringing friends!"}
{"text":"Tinuno is a small hole in the wall Filipino restaurant located in the St.James Town neighbourhood of Toronto and within a small walking distance from Sherbourne station.
It's offers normal Filpino dishes but it's really know for it's \"kamayan\" feast which means hand to mouth in Tagalog.

I went on a recent Saturday for lunch around 1:30 pm in the afternoon and it's a good idea to make reservations since the place is pretty small and it's getting really popular. We decided to order the kamayan feast for two ($15 plus tax per person, minimum two people) which consisted of grilled pork belly, pork skewers, mussels, milkfish, tilapia, shrimp and squid rings served on a bed of garlic rice with an accompanying mango salad and a drink which is included in the price. You could also get free refills of the garlic rice and mango salad. The food was fantastic, nicely grilled and lightly seasoned with your basic salt and pepper. Plastic cutlery was also available if you didn't feel comfortable eating with your hands.

The one issue I did have was with the service, the servers were nice but sometimes when you go to an ethnic restaurant and don't speak the language, you sometimes feel you don't get the same quality of service. We sat there for 10-15 minutes without any servers asking what we wanted to order while everybody else was been attending to, keep in mind the place is pretty small too. When I flagged down a server, they said our food was coming in 5 minutes, so I'm assuming they knew we were ordering the kamayan feast based off my phone reservation. 

Overall, regardless of the service hiccup issue, the food is fantastic and amazing value for your money, where are you going to get a feast of grilled meat and seafood with garlic rice, mango salad and a drink for $15 per person plus tax? The food is perfectly seasoned and nicely grilled. Tinuno is a true definition of a hole in the wall gem."}
{"text":"Worth the visit. Food is consistently good. Loved the garlic rice. 

Service can be spotty, always make a reservation for a guaranteed table. 

Place is small, tables are close together. It's cozy."}
{"text":"Been here three times and food ranges from lukewarm to full-on cold.  It's a fun experience and it is quite a feast, but I can't really recommend the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Filipino food and I'm so glad it was such a good experience with Tinuno. Make sure you have reservations cause this place was packed! 

The food came out fairly quickly. It was absolutely delicious and very flavourful. You also get fish sauce and srircha for dipping if you want an extra kick to it. Everything about the meal was awesome and its a fun experience too because you can eat with your hands (I suggest doubling up on the gloves to prevent oils leaking through!).

For $15 pp, you can't go wrong. I will definitely be coming back here very soon."}
{"text":"This is a small place that serves food budol style. This means there is a bundle of food to be shared among the table.  There is a patio, main floor and an upstairs area. We were seated upstairs, after about a 30 minute wait, despite reservations. It was all right because the upstairs was a lot less chaotic than the downstairs. There is a set meal for $15 per person. For $15 per person, you get a complete meal, with almost all the food groups and a bottle of water.  You start off with a mango salad and two slices of oranges, which was simple yet delectable. The serving size was abundant and the fried garlic rice is unlimited. The food was very tasty with its own unique flavours. The Bangus had a strong salty smoked taste, which was great with the fried garlic  rice. The tilapia was a whole grilled fish which had a milder taste. There was liempo, which is grilled pork, shrimps, whole soft grilled squid, grilled eggplant, mussels, okra and pork skewers. You get two of the mussels and shrimp each. As condiments, you get soy sauce, sirracha sauce, fish sauce and vinegar.  The serving size is definitely enough to fill you up. There is a roll of paper towels to wipe your hands.  I venture that this is a great deal, plus a fun place to have dinner! All the food was served kamayan style, which means you eat with your hands. They provide gloves as well, to minimize the mess. You may want to use this because the smell of the seafood can stick to your skin for awhile. The food was artfully and carefully placed, portioned per person on top of banana leaves. Definitely a great experience!  If you cannot finish the food, you can take it home. We also ordered the fried pork belly. Although tasty, it needed to be reduced and fried more as it was way too fatty and it was not as crispy as it should be. Parking is paid parking in the street."}
{"text":"The second you come in the smell is incredibly inviting! The seafood amount was large and the jasmine rice was on point. I thoroughly enjoyed it. There is nowhere in the GTA now a days you can get that amount of seafood THAT good for such a price, $15 pp.

It's a very relaxed place where everyone just enjoys good food and good vibes. 

The staff is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Just a heads up for new mommies. This place charges $8 for a 2 year old. They dont let you know that before hand. I went in today with my colleagues and brought my 2 year old with me. I was shocked to find out that he was being charged $8. All he ate was the oranges on the side. They didn't even have enough high chairs so i had to sit him on my lap. I have never been to a restaurant that charges this much for a 2 year old. Its ridiculous and would never go back to this place because I feel like i just got ripped off."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for my parents at 2pm on Saturday, but they didn't get a table till 2:50pm! They have been promised that food will be ready once they got a table since they waited for so long already. But after they got a table, they just offered water and still need to wait for super long... They ended up leave the restaurant and will never return. They were driving all the way from Markham to try out this place after checking some good reviews. But, Pretty disappointed with a poor management skills and lack of coordination! I clearly made a reservation for 2pm for 2 people! The only thing I appreciated is that one of the employee named Miguel, called me and apologized for the situation."}

The food is cooked fresh amd comes straight from the grill to your table and straight to your mouth. It feels like you're actually bonding with the people you eat with because you're eating with your hands so no one can go on their phones! Except at the beginning to take pictures of this amazing emsemble of garlic rice, seafood including squid, shrimp, fish amd clams, skewers and a variety of vegetables such as eggplants and okra.

It was the first time trying it and I really enjoyed it! I would definitely come back for this!! I would recommend coming in a big group because it really is a lot more fun getting to eat with everyone."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with family and friends when we visited Canada last week. My cousin RSVP prior to arriving, this will help get you a table fast since it was getting crowded due to lunch hour. It was small place and parking was a little bit tricky. It was all worth the trip there- food was awesome and the service was great!! We were served right away with garlic rice, assortment of sea food- fish, shrimp, squid, and pork barbecue all in a bed of banana leaves. We were all so stuffed, we need a lift to get off our chairs ;-) It was such a wonderful experience, we wish we have one here in KY, USA."}
{"text":"Very small and busy place, we pretty much sat right next to the other two guests there that night.  They happened to be friendly, so the experience turned out well.  
Definitely a place that is worth a try for the experience and for the great value.  You get a lot of grilled meat for the price."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Filipino food and I'm so happy I did! The food was delicious and our group of 6 had an amazing experience eating with our hands (with gloves)! The Kamayan feast is a steal at 15 dollars including a bottle of water. It starts with mango salad, followed by addicting garlic rice, two types of fish, grilled calamari, pork skewers, shrimp, mussels, eggplant and okra all laid out beautifully on banana leaves. Definitely an Instagram worthy photo! We ended our meal with the classic Filipino Ube ice cream ($1) . Yum!

This is a great place for a large group! Definitely recommend making reservations- request the upstairs room which is much quieter and cooler in temperature."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!
It's small but packed! You must come here with very empty stomach!

We left so full, and it was a perfect price point too.
We are major fans of this place. You get a little bit of everything laid on a bed of delicious garlic rice on a table in front of you. If you don't or can't eat fish or anything you just have to let them know, they are very accommodating. 

It's heavenly...Just put on a pair of plastic gloves and start stuffing your face!"}
{"text":"Kamayan two times in two weeks! The first time was at Shanee. I have to say that the flavors at Shanee were more complex, but the spread at Tinuno was significantly cheaper and also more impressive looking because of the kinds of protein they served. Shanee's shrimp were much bigger though, and fresher as well. Still, Tinuno's value can't be beat.

We came as a party of six Saturday afternoon. I tried to make a reservation. I spent the day before on the phone trying to reach them, but the line was perpetually busy. I tried again the next morning, rather early in the morning soon after they opened, but the line was still busy. There's no answering machine, so I couldn't even leave a message. I also messaged them on Facebook, where it says they usually answer in a few hours, but I didn't get a reply there either and I still haven't. We ended up walking in. I explained my issue to the lady at the counter. She told the man seating people that we were a walk-in for 6, which I suppose we were, which is rather unfortunate. No apologies for not picking up the phone or responding to my messages. I was told they'd try to fit us in, but we would only be able to sit down if a reservation didn't show. I was told that reservations often don't show. Um...okay then. They didn't show. We got the table. 

For $15/person, you get grilled shrimp, squid, mussels, pork BBQ skewers, pork belly, bangus (some kind of fish) belly, whole tilapia, eggplant, okra, garlic rice, and mango salad. Oh. And a bottle of water each. It's a good amount for what you pay, although I can see there being people who would want more food as well. We took home a small box of leftovers. The chili vinegar sauce in their condiments bottles helps cut some of the grease and smoke from all the grilled food, which does end up tasting similar as the meal progresses. The mango salad helps with that as well, as do the two slices of orange they provide. 

One thing I don't understand is how the portioning works. I heard you get one tilapia if you have 2 people in your party, and from 4-6 people, you get 2 tilapia. I feel like somewhere in the process, I lost a tilapia. I'm not sure if other things made up for it.

Heads up. It's cramped inside, so if you want to do this, either try for outside on a nice day or get it to go. I think that's doable. I think that if I crave this, I'm going to do takeout next time."}
{"text":"Had a great time at tinuno. This is an extremely small space but they have some extra seating upstairs. We made reservation ahead of time and they able to accommodate for our group.
What a fun experience! There isn't anything particularly amazing about the food. Quite simple but it was well presented and created a fun, more engaging experience to share with friends or family. Give it a try, put on some gloves, eat with your hands, get messy and enjoy! Well worth it especially for the price!"}
{"text":"Great small Spot.
Its really a feast. I love the taste of their grills...
Grilled fish - is amazing
Grilled pork: Amazing

Grilled Calamari: it was just a little bit over cooked.. so a bit on the chewy side...

But overall, will definitely keep going there. 

I love how the way they server the food also."}
{"text":"Delicious selection of fish and the rice is tasty. Make sure you book in advance cos this place is always full"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here twice. Once on a Sunday afternoon for lunch around 1pm and it was very busy. It took a while for the servers to notice us and took about 30-40 minutes to get a table for 3 without a reservation. The second time was a Tuesday night for dinner with a reservation for 12 people and we were able to get the whole front patio to ourselves. 

For $15 you get the Kamayan Feast with 2 fish (1 whole grilled with bones and the other was a fillet), grilled calamari, pork belly, a chicken skewer for each person, shrimp, mussels, eggplant and okra. With mango salad, slice of orange and a bottle of water. And their garlic fried rice is delicious, warm, lots of garlic flavour and refillable. The banana leaf on the table was also beautiful and smelled fragrant. They also have a spicy vinegar to dip. For $15 its a great deal for the amount of variety of food!

It is extremely worth it coming with 2 because you will get the same amount as you would for 4 people, but even with 3 people we were really really full after. The restaurant itself isnt the prettiest and the surrounding area is also not the nicest, the tables and chairs are very basic and the staff also seems to be in a flurry. The service isn't bad with the younger servers being more friendly. But its super fun eating with your hands (they provide gloves on the table if you want) Would definitely keep coming back, but its not an all the time everyday kind of meal. I'd also suggest going with people you are comfortable sharing with because of the family style and the fact you will be licking your fingers and putting hands back into the pile"}

Prior to visiting this place I had seen the posts of the Kamayan feast the previous summer and longed to go here. It wasn't until this spring that I managed to come here. Since then I've been there twice.

The food is amazing! The Kamayan feast comes with 2 types of fish, mussels, pork skewers, pork belly, grilled squid, okra, eggplant, and garlic rice. The pork belly and the pork skewers are my favorite of the items. The rice is very flavourful. 

The service was very friendly and accommodating. 

The restaurant itself has seating for about 30 people on the bottom floor. It can accommodate large groups, just make sure you have a reservation in advance.

With a price at $15/person and the amount and quality of food, there's hardly anything better in the area. The service is splendid. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing first experience... good value and variety. Service was fast. Make reservations before hand. Tables are a little cramped for space. What gem in the city.."}
{"text":"Tinuno: \"We have a breakfast menu available if you'd like... your choice -- heavy (Kamayan Feast) or not-heavy (breakfast items)\" 
Me: *turns to friend* \"What do you prefer? I know it's only 9:30AM...\"
Friend: \"Well, the breakfast items look really goo---\"
Me: *turns to Tinuno server* \"We'll take the Kamayan feast\"
Friend: \"...\"

My opinion only: TOTALLY worth the $15 + tax. I'd definitely go again. And yes, at any time of the day though, the morning we didn't need to wait to be seated... which was extra awesome. Since we went right when Tinuno opened, we did have to wait for the food to get prepped. So, would recommend going after 10AM. 

Everything tasted delicious and it was quite a visual treat to see a spread of seafood on a bed of rice against luscious green banana leaves. I felt transported to another city!

Tinuno is tucked away on Howard Street; you'll pass some old-school convenience stores and pharmacies before you see the black sign with white text: TINUNO."}

We also got free ice cream in celebration of their 2 year anniversary !"}
{"text":"Food and service: spot on
Price: $15 per person for a feast including a drink (coconut water available)? Yes please
Atmosphere: super casual (not a place to impress anyone)

Only downside to this place is....it's located in a not-so-friendly neighborhood and parking was very difficult. Make sure you make a reservation before you come. My bf and I had to wait a bit to get a table. We were lucky though because people who came later had to wait much longer than us. I loved the whole experience of eating food with my hands. It's not something I would crave though. I don't see myself coming here on a regular basis, but I would def recommend this place if you haven't tried the kamayan feast."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Visited over the summer and still remember this experience as very disappointing. Excited to try based on social media pictures but its really just hype. This restaurant is pretty small and cramped. Food was ok but service was slow and mediocre. Also, cleanliness was a concern. 

Arrived and waited for probably 40 mins just to get food. They don't bother to ask you what you want, the Kamayan Feast is what everyone orders. Interior is cramped so don't bring any big bags or purses with you. Think we could have put them on the floor? Nope, floor was dirty with bits of food and garbage. Flies were everywhere and even with a staff member squating them at our table after we commented on it, they were still persistantly getting into my face. I really was bothered by that and it made me question the cleanliness of the establishment. We were not sitting in the patio but inside. I seriously almost walked out but stayed because I already put my order through. 

To top this off, we would see people getting seated after us getting their own feast before we did. We also did not get the complimentary water bottle or salad like everyone else did until we questioned the staff. Food in general was okay but dry and honestly, I've had better at more inexpensive restaurants. 

Overall, I am not sure why people are rating this place so high. Food is okay at best. Come if you want the instagram picture but thats about it."}
{"text":"Took my family here which worked out well because with the Kamayan feast, there was something for everyone. There was shrimp, mussels and squid for my brother who loves seafood and meats for my wife who loves pork. My 2yo daughter also really loved it because we all got to eat with our hands along with her. 

Food: When you come in, they don't give you menus or anything. They will simply have the chefs prepare enough food for the table based on the number of guests. I've been here a few times now and each time and although the quantities of specific items vary slightly even with the same number of guests, there has always been more than enough food for everyone. You can tell everything is freshly grilled. There is unlimited garlic rice which is nice and a drink is included with your meal. A lot of Filipino families come here which, in my books, is always a good sign of good, authentic cuisine.

Service: We've always had nothing but sincere, kind and efficient service from the staff here. They are always very nice to my daughter and quick with things like refills. Since you eat with your hands, there is a very nice, casual experience to this and during your meal you can almost forget that you're in the middle of a packed restaurant and simply enjoy the company of friends and family like you would at home.

Overall: Would highly recommend this place as a different dining experience for a group of people. The food is simply prepared, and the quality and the service is more than proportionate to the price you pay. Only wish they served beer or wine...:)"}
{"text":"This place was okay. First time having Philippino food and the kamayan style was different. An experience to have for sure. However, there are some things can be worked upon.

1. Proper management in terms of service as I reserved a table for 6:30pm and there was no table ready... And they are slow service. I get you gave to service a roomful of people but it's not a big place... 

2. Food was mediocre but the talapia was charred. Also squid is a little overdone so it gets a little rubbery. 

Here are all the points from me but however, a tip...
Be sure to look at your bill closely and make sure you are not overcharged and make sure you tell them what you wanted properly. I asked the milkfish and talapia kamayan and only the milkfish came. I asked there was a fish missing and came back and they charged us for it. 

Also I think they charged us extra for a glass of water. Hmmm. I don't think these kids know what they are doing. Sorry for being harsh but it's true. 

I don't think I will try again however.

3 stars for price and the kamayan experience (DIY food)"}
{"text":"This place had great service, value and delicious food. Other than being small, I have no complaints. Loved the flavor!"}
{"text":"For $15/person the feast is pretty good! I would definitely come back here again when I'm hungry. The portions were just right and the presentation was great! If you love seafood and do NOT mind using your hands, then I would highly recommend you try this place. One thing, MAKE A RESERVATION THAT YOU ARE ORDERING THE FEAST.

This place sits maybe about 20 or so people, so it is very easily cramped especially during a busy time (ie: noon on a weekend). They provide you utensils, plastic gloves if you aren't really OK with using your hands. Also, when they provide you the food, it is placed in the middle of the table. So you just help yourself. They did provide bottled water, which was apparently free of charge. 

I did not make a reservation and thus had to wait almost an hour before being seated and getting food.

Food: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Price Point: 5/5"}
{"text":"If you expect some fancy place then don't come here.  If you want to feel like your in your friend's home enjoying a great dinner then come here!

We had a big group (10-12 people) so we were seating in the 2nd floor where they can accommodate 2 large tables - up to about 20 people or so.  

You will be digging right in (literally) when the food comes out.  It's put right in front of you - the garlic fried rice, the different fish (oh my the fish were absolutely delicious), the mussels, the shrimp, squid, some prok items, okra and mango salad....all on banana leaves that cover the entire table.  Put on your gloves (yup - no utensils here) and eat with your hands!  That's what Kamayan is all about!

Personally I found the shrimp annoying to peel with gloves on, and the squid a little rubbery, but overall everything was delicious.  It can get a little cramped if you have a large group so make sure you love your neighbor!

I believe we paid about $15 per person - a great steal!  This is definitely a gem."}
{"text":"Great to come across this (thanks Blog TO).
I work around the corner and would easily return once a week.
Pork Kebabs terrific, chicken, beef ALL good.
Only suggestion; TURN UP THE HEAT ON THE SITTING FOOD (avoid health inspection issues; under temperature)."}
{"text":"My wife loves phillipino and this place did not disappoint. I loved the garlic rice and my wife found the spam and lumpia delectable. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Great place to experience Filipino food in the downtown area. The placed may be a bit cramped but to fit all of its guests shows its popularity with the cuisine. Eating with your bare hands or gloves is what is required here and the food is cooked to perfection of Filipino tradition."}
{"text":"So simple, so cheap, so good. This is bang for your buck for the amount of rice, seafood and meat you get. I love how they give you garlic rice, not just plain rice."}
{"text":"This place offers an authentic philipino BBQ dining. The seasoning of the meat and seafood was great. The food and service is delicious for the price you pay. Very very reasonable.

The restaurant is not too new and gives you a feeling of T&T, but totally worth the visit to try this amazing food and interesting experiences eating food with hands from the banana leaf."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Canada, I have a list of food places I want to try and this was one of them. My cousins and I stopped by here for an early dinner on a Monday late afternoon. The place is small and it's nearby the subway station. To my surprise, they seem to have the Kamayan feast everyday which is a major plus cause that's exactly why we came here! Now let's talk about the food... guys the food is nothing short of authentic Filipino food! I was stunned how amazing it was! Will come back here again next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"In short, this place is amazing. Tunino makes traditional filipino cuisine, which is served on a leaf that covers the entire table. Essentially, the meal consists of rice with BBQ pork, fish, okra, eggplant, squid, mussel and shrimp. You dont even need to order from a menu; the meal is set and the portions are simply based on how many people in your group. The meal is meant to be eaten with your hands and everyone is given plastic gloves.

In terms of the actual food, the meat was barbecued perfectly, the portions were HUGE, and was overall very tasty. The best part is that the meal is an experience in itself and is fun if youre comfortable with the people you are with. The meal was around $15 or so per person.

As for atmosphere, the restaurant is small and casual with a small outdoor seating area. It is recommended that you make reservations at least a day or two in advance. However, my party was lucky enough to grab a seat right away walking in.

FYI reservations recommended and the restaurant doesn't answer the phone reliably"}
{"text":"Go for the experience! It definitely feels authentic because you are in a crowded, smoke-filled restaurant, and eating with your hands! According to filipino friends, it's one of the most authentic places in TO. 

However.. the food was average. The meats were good.. but the amount of meat they give you is so little. Like one skewer per person plus some shredded meat pieces on the side. We opted for the milk fish (it's the boneless option) and it was the driest piece of fish I have ever had.

The garlic rice is sooo addicting though. 

Overall, it's ok worth it.. but I didn't find the portion to be humongous as per other reviewers.."}
{"text":"This is like a hidden gem right by the exit on the dvp. Very small place with limited tables and seating but you can just tell that it's family owned and run by a bunch of friendly Filipino people.

I've been here a few times and I ALWAYS get the feast. For $15 a person, you get lots of food! With 2 or more people they serve your food right on the table, with only 2 people, they bring it out to you on a wooden board with a banana leaf underneath the foods.

Best experience I would say is to come with a bigger group, but make sure to make reservations first because this place fills up fast!! With a larger group, you experience them plating each type of food right in front of your eyes. They first set up the table covered with banana leaves, then hot, steaming garlic, seasoned rice on the bottom. As soon as you smell the rice, your stomach is just screaming I want it NOW! Then they place the fishes, 2 kinds (a whole one, plainly grilled and a fillet which is seasoned) then they place the skewers, grilled with sauce, the squid with some tomato salsa in it, some chopped up grilled pork belly, shrimps and mussels to follow and finally the veggies (grilled eggplant and okra). Then they give you a mango salad with 2 slices of orange and a dipping vinegar sauce for the food.

This meal also comes with a drink, pop, water, whatever they have. You have to eat with your hands so they provide you with a pair of disposable gloves. If you want other sauces they have a selection where you can pour some out into a container and bring it back to your table. 

Before you walk to the cash and pay for the food, they sometimes have Filipino snacks in the display, you HAVE to pick one up on you're way out. For $1 a piece for the spring roll looking one, it's filled with a sweet plantain and wrapped in a thin, crispy, sweet pastry on the outside. The other rice one, is not always available, so must try when they have it for sale!

*P.S. - Just watch out on their grilled foods, I have had some over grilled items where its super dark and bitter on the outside and dry on the inside."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Filipino cuisine and Tinuno far surpassed my expectations! I came here for a Sunday lunch with 9 people and surprisingly got a seat at the crowded restaurant in their second-floor party room. They even let us bump our own tunes! 

Only half our table wanted the Kamayan feast and the waitstaff were super accommodating. The feast was a messy communal experience, but well worth the saucy plastic gloves and seafood shells. The mango salad and white rice provided the right balance with the dry, grilled seafoods and meats, and the flavours worked wonderfully together. The best part was feeling like the meal actually brought us closer together since many of us were meeting for the first time - and what better way to become acquainted than eating with our hands together from the same row of food! I can't wait to come back for my second feast and to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Great experience for the price.
Very ethnic in the sense that you get the food served on a banana leaf, and you get to eat with your hands!
The flavors were great. From the fish, to the rice. Very fun and social-able"}
{"text":"I came here with some work colleagues.  I've never been to a Kamayan meal before, and was a bit nervous eating with my hands and making a mess in front of my workmates!
But it ended up being super fun - the food was great, so much variety of seafood - bangus, mussels, huge shrimp, etc!  And a total bargain!  I ended up bringing lots of leftovers home.

And don't be nervous if you're a germaphobe, they do provide gloves to eat with if you prefer!

Great experienced, and something a bit more fun than the usual sit down meal!  Great for families and kids."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here, based on all the great reviews and of course, the photos depicting the amazing feasts eaten here every day. 

I've had one other Kamayan feast experience in Toronto and it was more than double the price of Tinuno. However, if given a choice, I'd sooner throw down the extra cash at Lamesa than eat at Tinuno again. 

I found that the food here all tasted the same, as everything was cooked in the same manner. It looks good, and the portions are certainly quite generous for the price, but there was really nothing special about the meal. The ambiance is certainly not great (we dined upstairs) and it felt like we were eating in an office as opposed to a restaurant. It was cramped and uncomfortable. I guess they just try to get as many people in and out as they can, in order to generate any kind of profit. I don't know how else they can make money when they're only charging $15 per person. I'm sure the food quality is not very high, otherwise they'd be losing money hand over fist. 

Still, it was an interesting experience. Cheap enough that it's not a big regret, but not good enough to make me want to return."}
{"text":"Restaurant is located near Sherbourne TTC station. Came here for a Friday night dinner around 7pm.  The place was packed with diners and people waiting for a table.  Luckily we had reservations so our table was already setup for us.  The decor looked run down and seats were those fold up seats you can get at Canadian tire. Here is a list of what is included in  

$15.00 per person Kamayan Feast: Grilled Bangus, Grilled Tilapia,  Grilled Calamari, Pork Belly, Pork Skewers, Shrimps, Mussels, Okra, Eggplants, Garlic Rice, Mango Salad, Slices of Orange

Most of the food was good.  Shrimp was overcooked.  I usually don't like okra but this place cooked it well without the slimy texture.  Was expecting bigger portion size based on photos I've seen posted by others.  Our meal had less squid and fish than what other tables got.  Maybe its because we came in a group of 7 and they are more use to serving food in pairs.  We were told that we get one drink for free but later found out it was only the water bottles so we were charged extra for pop.  Also we had to get the drinks ourselves near the entrance of the restaurant.

Was super excited about going here but ended up being an average dinner.  I'd recommend going there in even numbers on a night they aren't super busy."}
{"text":"My favourite filipino restaurant!

You see these pics?! You come for a feast, you get a feast! Eat with your hands right off the table: meats and veggies on a bed of rice, on a bed of banana leaves, on a bed of deliciousness.

The kamayan feast features 12 items for $15 a person: grilled bangus, grilled tilapia, grilled calamari, pork belly, pork BBQ, mussels, shrimps, eggplant, okra, mango salad, garlic rice, and a drink! Everything is delicious - get ready to be stuffed.

Everything is nicely seasoned (including the garlic rice!) and fresh. Staff is friendly and accommodating - get to know their stories! Has a warm home style feel. We'll be back to try some ube ice cream next time!"}
{"text":"Kamayan feast at Tinuno! It's Filipino food that you can eat with your hands. It's generally grilled pork and seafood over garlic rice, laid out on banana leaves. You also get grilled vegetables (eggplant and okra), plus mango salad and orange slices to start. They do have gloves for those who don't want to get all greasy. 

It's only $15 per person! Really can't beat that price for such a large amount of food. 
There's both patio and indoor sitting. It's better to make a reservation if you're going around peak dinner time."}
{"text":"Was asked to come here last summer,  but couldn't get our off work to go to their infamous Amex commercial taping.  We had the upstairs booked for a B-Day and the B-Day girl was a little late.  Staff was a little impatient as they needed a total right away and wanted us in and out.  Understandable, as there was a party right after us in that room, and it's a very small place. I would suggest and hour buffer in between reservations and letting customers know.  

Over all wonderful food,  loved the rice and the fish options.  Standout was certainly the grilled calamari and also the meat skewers. The fried fish was good,  but it was cold by the time it was served to us. Over all good food,  presentation, and it's a fun place to take guests. 

Was surprised they charged full price to a 3 year old though, as one of the guests had her children with her and had to pay $27 per head of her kids,  who were 3, 7, and 13. Pricey. Just a heads up to those thinking of bringing kids.  Also, they don't have a license,  and do offer glasses of water if you don't want to do bottled water."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time. The food was excellent. The staff was accommodating when I came in with my two young children. The only set back is that there isn't much room inside, but I eat early anyhow, so that worked well for us. It was just great. Very family friendly."}
{"text":"We ordered the $15 per person filipino BBQ meal set for four (tax, tip, and pop included!). The meal set consisted of, for starters, mango salad, followed by BBQ pork, BBQ chicken, salmon steak, BBQ shrimp, another whole BBQ fish (not sure what kind, but tasty!), and BBQ squid. It was an incredible amount of really high-quality food at a great price! Just remember to call in and preorder this meal set ahead of time. Well worth the money."}
{"text":"First time I went I find the place is so small and parking is not free on Howard St.

The food presentation was amazing but the food just like the photo but bad news is not flavourful the food is was burnt. There were missing the tomatoes condiments on the seafood. The food didn't taste special just like any BBQ cooked.

and it took more then 20minutes it was not busy before we arrived before 1pm on a Sunday.

Service was bad if you wanted to order for drinks they are not seen around.
They waitress ignore you when you asked for the bill.
Sorry this place is not worth the hype it is over priced. 

The food part is they give you free 1bottle of water."}
{"text":"So about this place...it's really really...awesome. First time here and arrived with no expectations. Called ahead two hours before to make a reso. Glad we did. 

Arrived to a busy little restaurant in a very unusual location. 

Gave them our name and was seated promptly. This is very much a communal eating experience. And as such, definitely not good for 1st to fifth date. 

There are no menus. When you sit down, that is essentially ordering. 

Food arrived in 20 mins. Gorgeous presentation. I was with a buddy so we were served the food on a wooden block. For larger parties, they serve the food on banana leaves laid out on the table. 

So here's what came on the board:

1 whole tilapia. 
1 whole milk fish. 
Grilled calamari
4 shrimp
4 muscles 
Pork belly
BBQ pork 
Okra
Eggplant
Mango salad 
4 orange wedges 
Unlimited rice 

It was exceptionally delicious. We met these two Ladies who were from Scarborough and who drove out here. She said it was as close to 'back home' as possible. 

Glad I got to try this place. 

$15/person and worth every penny."}
{"text":"MUST TRY:
Kamayan Feast (also because we never saw a menu, and they didn't even ask what we wanted to order)

The Kamayan Feast is a grilled set that you eat with your hands, and you share as a table. Minimum 2 people.
Includes: 
2 types of fish
shrimp (in the shell)
mussels
pork belly
pork skewers
eggplant
okra
bed of rice. 
mango salad + orange. 
bottle of water

(if you don't like seafood and pork, it might be tough to eat here)

It's messy, it's smelly, it's a fun experience. Expect to drop some food or knock it off the table. Since you're eating with your hands, and you share with your table, you want to be comfortable with the people that you're eating with. Make sure that nobody is a germophobe / picky eater / allergy victim before you come.

Tuesday night and it was packed.

It's disorganized.

Hoping to make a reservation, I called the phone number about 5 times over the course of 24 hours leading up to the night. The phone kept ringing, and nobody answered. They do not have a voicemail system.

I walked in the door and there were a few people waiting in the doorway. Trusting my instincts, I walked further in. The servers were all super busy (and relatively hard to identify due to lack of uniforms), so I thought the cashier at the back might help. After waiting a few minutes, I talked to a server and she offered me the 2nd last table.

My friends arrived in the next few minutes. After being ignored for several minutes, I asked a server for a menu. She said that our order had already been placed, although we never ordered. They assumed that we wanted 4 Kamayan Feasts. Luckily, that was what we wanted. She said it would take 20 minutes. It was hot inside, so I asked her for the waters.

The lack of communication didn't bother me, as it probably didn't affect our meal. However, it could be problematic, especially for people who are noobs, picky eaters, or allergic to something.

Overall, the food was good, but not amazing. No doubt, It's worth a one time experience"}
{"text":"The Great Kamayan fare! I came here on a weekday night with a couple of yelp friends and was amazed by how packed it was! Good thing we had a reservation. This place is great for having a large group of ~12 ppl. They have an upstairs that can accommodate 2 large groups! They even let us play our own song through your cellphone. 

They first cover the tables with banana leaves, then they add the garlic fried rice which by the way you can ask for more when you ran out. We Filipinos, love to feed everyone garlic fried rice. Then they top it with Milk fish (Bangus), tilapia, grilled okra, grilled eggplants, BBQ pork on a stick, grilled pork belly, mango salad and a fruit slice. Everything was great! I particularly liked the milkfish deboned, their soft thin fish bones are annoying! Although the tilapia wasn't deboned, the fish bones are thick and easy to pick out. 

I'm happy to say I would recommend this place! It's affordable and tasty!"}
{"text":"#TINUNO #FILIPINOFOOD #FILIPINOFEAST #KAMAYAN #YELPTO

Eat with yer hands Filipino fare, I am sad to say I wasn't as impressed as my other Yelp friends were. It's an experience you have to try atleast once, and I'll totally bring someone out to Tinuno to just try something new - but it will not be my go to first pick. I've tried a similar cultural experience with Indian Bengali food and it beats Kamayan 10 times. 

As in all the photos you see, you eat off of imported banana leaves with your hands or gloves. They put out rice first, which is actually quite yummy with this vinegar dip they have. And the rice was very honestly, the best part of the meal. They cover the rice with meat, seafood, fish and grilled vegetables. Okras and eggplants went untried - I tried the shrimp (weak), mussels (weak), fish (good) and grilled pork kebobs (okay). 

I will say though, that for $15-20 and $3 roadside parking outside, this was a fairly good meal. Don't expect fancy though."}
{"text":"We went in for a Kamayan style lunch for a birthday party. This was my first time having it and it wasn't disappoint. Food was great and it was such a unique experience to have. The amount of food that you get isn't a joke either. It is a lot. 

If you never had a Kamayan, come here and try it for yourself. One thing to remember. Whatever you do, just remember. Use your hand!"}
{"text":"Had the feast- loved the bbq skewer and squid. A great portion size for $15/person. It's a hole in the wall but food was delicious."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out the Kamayan Feast for quite some time since I saw how amazing the food looked, and I've finally gathered a group of friends to try out the restaurant with me. 

Environment:
The restaurant is located right off the Sherborne Subway Station. I've never been to the area before and I was expecting a downtown Toronto vibe, but then when I got out of the station I was a bit turned off by how \"sketchy\" the area seemed. Even though the Bloor-Yonge intersection is only a subway station away, the Sherborne area felt really quiet in comparison. The houses seem a little run down with graffiti on the walls, and one of my friend told me this is not an area you want to be in at night because there have been shootings :/
Onto the restaurant itself. Tinuno is actually a very small family-owned restaurant with very limited seating. We called for reservation ahead of time so we were able to secure our spot, but they had to turn away some people because they were super packed on the Friday night. Other than our group of 7, they also had another group of 14, and then another group of 10, who ended up had to sit upstairs because the downstairs area was overfilled with customers. Even though the restaurant was clean and all, it was really tight due to the over-booking, which led to a not-so-good dining experience.

Food:
Our group ordered the Kamayan Feast to share among us. They first layer the table with banana leaves imported directly from the Philippines to complete the authentic dining experience. Then they provided us each a portion of their mango salad with oranges as appetizers. After that, they layered the garlic rice bedding across the middle of the table, then piled up the meats and veggies. 
For $15 per person we got grilled Bangus fish fillet (their local fish from the Philippines), grilled whole Tilapia, grilled calamari, pork belly, BBQ pork skewers, mussels, shrimps, eggplants, and okras. For that kind of price it's pretty worth it and a lot of the meats were seafood. I really liked the fish, pork belly, and especially the really flavourful BBQ pork skewers. 
One of my friend had been to Tinuno before and she commented that when she was here in a party of 3, they got more food to share among them. Later on I noticed that when I looked around as well, as the 2 people tables got more food per person on average. At our table, it was basically survival of the fittest, in which we fought over who gets what pieces of meat and the person who seated themselves strategically at the table and ate the fast was the champion. 

Service:
We arrived at around 6:45pm for our 7pm reservation, but we didn't get seated until around 7:20pm because they were overbooked and were overwhelmed with the amount of traffic. After they seated the other 14-person group, the waiters pulled out more tables to set our table up, and I was amazed at how quickly they were able to arrange everything. 
Even though the waiters were clearly overwhelmed, they remained composed and handled the situation very well, without being frustrated toward the customers. Our waitress was really welcoming and she explained to us the origins of some the ingredients. Even though the traditional way of eating Filipino food is to use your hands (they provide the gloves), they can also accommodate those who prefer chopsticks or forks.

Overall, I had a great experience at Tinuno, as the food was delicious and it was plentiful for me that left me satisfied after our meal. I would consider returning, but definitely at a less busy time and with a much smaller group."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Good food and good price. Hidden in an unassuming building, its quite small and seats around 20, maybe 30 if you're really packed in there. They do a bunch of other dishes, but I've only been for the kamayan feast, which at $15 per person including a bottle of water is amazing. The first time I went on a weekend afternoon they were out of one type of fish and gave us two of the whole fishes, the restaurant wasn't too busy, but the food and service were great. This time they had everything and it was way busier on a weeknight evening, service was still good. Would be interested in trying some of the other dishes that I saw other people taking out."}

Great food, for an amazing price and you won't ever forget about it. 

Thank you Big Cousin for the hard work you've put in. 

The Turon is amazing, but your smile is even better  

Have a great meal everyone, and don't forget to tip us"}
{"text":"First time dining in at a Filipino restaurant and had a pleasant experience.  This restaurant has very minimal seats and reminds me of dining at a food court.  I def recommend making reservations 

Had two orders of the kamayan feast for two people.  $15 per person.  Boy, oh boy were we stuffed.  We weren't able to finish the food because there was just so much food!  The food was delicious.  

Great customer service!  The owners are super friendly and attentive.  They kept checking on my friend and I to see if we needed anything and see if we enjoyed food."}
{"text":"Came here at dinner time for the experience and  company.. Nothing really special with regards to the taste and preparation of the food. As for the price, not worth it  with the portion/serving.
One star is for the calamansi soda... refreshing.
Again, to each his own. Once is enough for me at this place."}
{"text":"Before this experience, I had kamayan at La Mesa and in the Philippines.  At La Mesa it was about $50 two years ago.  When I found out that it was $15 per set at Tinuno, I was so excited!  We made reservations on the day of on a Saturday. When we arrived our table wasn't ready because there was a party of probably 15 people finishing up.  The restaurant is pretty small, so I would suggest calling ahead to make reservations, just in case.

Between the 3 of us, we ordered two sets, and it was more than enough.  The BBQ pork was my fave, as well as the calamari. I love carbs, and their garlic rice was absolutely delicious! Here, if you don't want to get your hands dirty, you can ask them for disposable gloves. 

Seriously, I can't get over the price.  For such a price, the value and quality of the meal was superb."}
{"text":"I love rice and this place is cheap you eat w your hands and theres seafood that comes along w yes...the rice which is unlimited
All for 15 dollars
But yeah the rice..."}
{"text":"Came here for the Kamayan Feast on a busy Friday night. The restaurant was super accommodating and kind enough to save our table even though traffic made us super late. 

The portion and quality of food for the price ($15) can't be beat! Laid out on top of a bed of garlic rice are a variety of skewered meats, seafood and veggies. You also get oranges and mango salad on the side to balance out the meal. The meal is shared by the table and you have to eat with your hands although plastic gloves are provided. 

The restaurant itself is quite small and packed so I would avoid coming with a group larger than 4."}
{"text":"Very amazing environment if you eat there. There were too many people when I got there so I did takeout instead. Meat is tasty but a but overcooked. Rice is yummy coz there's a mix of garlic and other stuff in it."}
{"text":"I'f you dont mind eating with your hands, you could eat like a pig here! My kind of place! Great Filipino establishment and surprisingly inexpensive. You get more of what you order as a duo, and you get less fingers in your plate. Good eating here!"}
{"text":"Came here to order their famous BBQ. Was quite disappointed. The food I can tell was already pre cooked in the glass shelf and just reheated. But did not even reheat it enough. Half my food was still cold. One of the fish has a lot of scales on it.. the BBQ pork was good and so was the mango salad. Great that they include the drink in the price but most likely wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great service, they didn't rush us. Very organized service for such a small space, which I appreciated. Great food, perfect for someone who had no clue about Filipino food. And at such a reasonable price being the absolute cherry on top.  Will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to that place for a long time based on the pictures and Yelp reviews and I finally had the chance to go today. It was definitely worth the wait! 

The service is friendly and efficient but what really stood out to me is the delicious food! I do not eat meat, only seafood, therefore I cannot comment on the taste of the meat items since I didn't taste them. The bangus was possibly the best one I have ever had. It was grilled to perfection and seasoned right. The garlic rice is delicious as well. The shrimps were tasty and the tilapia too. 

Make sure to make a reservation before going, it is extremely packed."}
{"text":"I read some of the reviews on here. Some people are weird, rating a $15/person place like it's a 4 star restaurant or something. Rate accordingly to the price bracket people, you're here for food, not ambience or service. 
Another few that were off to me, \"the fish was charred\". Um, no, it isn't, the skin is, but you peel that off. Lol a few of them were like, \"Well, we reserved for 10 people, one cancelled, and we were still charged for the extra person\". Lol, kids, split the $15 between the other 9 people. Iunno, different strokes I guess. 

But for $15, in 2018, with no price increase despite 20% increase in minimum wage, this place deserves all 5 stars and then some. All of the food was delicious, delivered hot, with excellent garlic fried rice. You should definitely check this place out before they close, because if they don't raise prices, with the amount of good they give, they can't stay open for long."}
{"text":"Tinuno offers take-out and kamayan! Most of the people that come here go for the kamayan feast. Def recommend it too, it's a great experience!

Essentially a kamayan feast consists of your entire meal loaded onto banana leaves and everyone just eats off of it! At Tinuno, for only $15 per person, you have delish garlic fried rice in the centre of your table and BBQ'd veggies, meats, and seafood layered on top of the rice. 

To start off, they give each person a little bit of julienned mango and carrot, and some orange wedges. Shortly afterwards, your carb and protein feast begins! 

The garlic rice is so addicting! It's a little bit sticky so you can ball it up and stuff it in your mouth. The staff are always willing to top off your garlic rice in case you totally demolish all of that goodiness.
The veggies that they had included were eggplant and okra - both if which are really yummy when they're grilled!
The seafood you get are: tilapia, bangus, shrimp, and mussel. The fish (tilapia and bangus) were pretty dry and overcooked. The tilapia was not the greatest... kinda tasted like dirt (pretty typical of tilapia right?!) but then again, I'm not the biggest tilapia fan. The bangus is really good though! According to wiki, bangus is milkfish. It's naturally quite salty, so when eaten with the rice it's really good! Shrimp and mussels were alright. 
The meat you get are: pork bellys and a pork skewer. The pork skewer was really good! It's marinated in a sweet sauce which gets caramelized from the grill. Yummmm.

Some of the foods were definitely a little bit too burnt - like the vegetables and the fishes. 

For those who don't want to get down and dirty with their bare hands, they have boxes of plastic gloves on the table! Eat with your fingers (after washing them with soap of course!), it's so much easier and fun!

Overall, this was a really great experience and I definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried kamayan before!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and there was no wait. They accommodated us very quickly and got the food to our tables very quickly. However, the food was limited and all the other good stuff was extra on top of what we paid. However for about 16 Canadian dollars per person for lunch I thought it was a good deal. Overall I like the setup and I would definitely come back here again and I felt like the owner was very accommodating and also very hospitable. Everybody was very nice and the food was good but it lacks sauces in the traditional Filipino fare"}
{"text":"Meat are nicely salted and they serve a lot of that garlic flavored rice. The mango slices nicely compliment with everything else. Would want to come back again!"}
{"text":"Eating with your bare hands (kamayan) is a nice gimmick. Reasonable price, a set for $15 per person. The set is a lot of food: shrimp, mussels, squid, butter fish, talipia, mango salad, orange,  garlic rice, okra, pork belly.... I had to pack a portion of leftovers to go.

At Tinuno there is not much space and the restaurant typically crowded. Lunch and dinner hours are likely packed. However, they priced reasonably (in fact cheap for the what they offered) , overall dishes have rich flavors and great taste. In the set meal, some meat is done better than the other (for example, pork belly is grilled to perfection but talipia is burnt).  For those first timer, the kamayan will not be disappointed. I think the main improvement need is the seating."}
{"text":"Good food, a good variety / selection of food, healthy portions & friendly service. Definitely worth a try if you have not been..."}
{"text":"Great Kamayan experience. The place is small - ok, it's cramped, and very busy. Make a reservation or be prepared to wait. Don't bring your large knapsacks or shopping bags here unless you don't mind putting them on the floor. 

Food was excellent, everything was cooked just right. They were able to accommodate the non pork eaters in our group (I called in advance but that may not have been necessary) and they provided plastic cutlery if you need it. The price point can't be beat. 

We definitely enjoyed our experience and I would come back again."}
{"text":"A very interesting concept... reasonable price and ok service! The food is good too, though not my favorite."}
{"text":"First time trying Filipino food and kamayan feast. The pork skewers and garlic rice are great. The fish was a little too fishy and I didn't enjoy it as much as the other meats. You eat with your hands. The restaurant is small and can get loud."}
{"text":"You don't have to worry about which fork to use, or which spoon to use. What a fun place where you can just dig in and eat an entire feast on a banana leaf with your hands. For $15 you get to try everything from fish to pork to mussels, shrimps. Just as the name Tinuno implies, all of the food is cooked on a grill. If you don't want to get down and dirty with your hands they offer plastic gloves as well. Halo halo is seasonal only. Meal goes well with mango juice"}
{"text":"Fantastic. It looks pretty sketchy when you first come in but the food is inexpensive and fantastic. There is only one menu so sit down and enjoy. Inexpensive as we only paid $15 per person. We are big eaters and added more pork belly but most people will be satisfied. Note they don't divide things properly as a table of 2 gets one fish and so does a table of 5. You get the second fish at 6 people which is sort of silly. However overall it's inexpensive and tastes great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here about 3 weeks ago to try their kamayan feast as we kept hearing about it and finally found time to go! This hole in the wall place is located in a somewhat rough looking area but if you can ignore the shabby looking exterior with its wooden plank door and partly boarded up window, you'll be surprised to find a homey place to eat some good Filipino food. We saw several customers getting take out and some dining in for their regular Filipino dishes.

The kamayan feast here for $15 per person is probably the best deal you can get in the GTA for this type of feasting. You get rice on banana leaves with piles of barbecued pork, milkfish, mussels, grilled octopus slices, shrimp, some veggies like okra and eggplant along with mango salad and orange slices for a bright touch. It was nicely presented, good simple flavours and very filling! Their version of kamayan is more authentic and rustic compared to Lamesa's $50 per person fancier fusion spin - both versions are delicious but Tinuno is obviously way more budget friendly.

I definitely recommend going with a smaller group as we saw for ourselves that larger portions seem to be given to groups of 2 like us compared to the portion that a group of 6 had gotten. Also remember to call ahead to make a reservation (no online booking) as this place is small and fills up quickly. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They have a very strict policy of not selling broken \"imperfect turon\" which are left on display when the \"perfect turons\" are sold out."}
{"text":"*Check your receipt and ask before you pay.  Service charge and water charge.
*3.5 stars (Yelp doesn't have 1/2 points).

I knocked off a star because after I found my receipt 2 weeks later, I realized they overcharged all of us...Can't figure out the math, but seems like we were charged for bottled water (we all had tap water) and a service charge that we weren't informed of so we tipped on top of their service charge.

Okay food grilled without seasoning, but tastier this second visit when I realized there were sauce bottles that added flavour.  The restaurant has no ambience whatsoever (typical from the very few Filipino restaurants I've been to), but I'm okay with it since the food is okay.  The items were all good, but we weren't crazy about the pork (skilly slices).  Service could be friendly because they're all serious, but leave you alone.

We we're nearby and took the chance and showed up last minute because they weren't answering their phone.  They were fully booked, but accommodated us and initially asked us several times if we could finish eating within 45 minutes prior to giving us the table.  We were starving and agreed after we confirmed we had 45 minutes to eat once the food arrived.  It took longer for the food to arrive versus us inhaling it.  They had several empty tables that were reserved and were still empty when we left."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Philippines and kamayan feasts are nostalgic experiences that remind me of family... Tinuno brought me back and I was delighted by how close the food was to our feasts back home!

THE GOOD:
- Fresh off the grill, juicy food
- Unlimited garlic rice
- Dat mango salad!!
- Friendly servers who get the job done

COULD BE BETTER:
- Do not expect a comfortable experience/ambiance; this is a tight space and there are some flies!
- Do not expect the servers to check in on you often - you may need to flag them down for attention."}
{"text":"We were here for my bday. Ten of us, with differing palates, ate very well. Very casual place. Garlic Rice was great. Squid and fish were standouts for me. Everything was simply prepared, but delicious. None of us had eaten kamayan style before. After some initial awkwardness, we all got the hang of it. Lots of fun. Highly recommended, but get reservations, especially for a big group."}
{"text":"We ordered the kamaya feast for 5 people and it was interesting as you eat it with gloves. But remember that you have to call and preorder the feast ahead of time, which is good because then you get your food fairly quick as well. 

Some good points about the feast is that it comes with bottled water, oranges and mangos. The taste of the feast was mostly very flavourful, the rice in particular seemed to soak in a lot of the flavour from the seafood and was a nice plus. One part of the fish tasted the best in comparison to the other parts it seems as though they were seasoned differently. 

Some bad parts of the feast was that there was only 1 squid to share amongst five people. Also, the restaurant was a little cramped so every time someone would walk in the aisle you'd have to be careful. Another thing is while there are gloves, no bibs are provided so be wary when eating the rice or the skewer as sauce and rice bits would fall onto your lap if you're clumsy like I am. 

While the food was tasty, it would not be a restaurant that I would visit over and over again, I would revisit to bring people who is from out of town just to expose them to this type of dining experience."}
{"text":"Yummy delicious grilled goodness! Food was fresh all made to order...with a kamayan experience that can't be beat!! MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Awesome filipino bbq joint! Can't go wrong with $15/pp... the bbq'ed meat and garlic rice is delicious!"}
{"text":"If ya like AUTHENTIC, CHEAP, LARGE portions, this place is for you! I read about Tinuno in BlogTo and had to give it a go. By far, my fav new restaurant this year. 

For $15 per person, I got the BBQ set that came with grilled squid, grilled fish, grilled pork, chicken, mussels, shrimp, mango salad AND a drink. Ask for the hot sauce, which is homemade by the owner - not ya typical siracha.

Owner is also hella nice. He came by and chatted with us for 15 mins. Real nice guy with a backstory of starting this place."}
{"text":"Great prices for authentic homemade Filipino food. My faves for a quick snack is the lumpiang shanghai (meat filled spring rolls ) and the Turon (banana with brown sugar and jackfruit spring roll). 
Still haven't had the Kamayan feast which consists of a spread of grilled fish buffet on banana leaves eaten with your hands or tried the traditional Filipino breakfasts (longsilog- eggs ,fried rice, sweet and spicy chorizo). Good place for quick take out or just in the mood for some good summery low maintenance Filipino eats."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waiters were extremely rude and inattentive, and had a very poor attitude."}
{"text":"After seeing many pictures on Instagram of people eating food with their hands, I really wanted to check out Tinuno! 

I recently came here for lunch with 3 of my friends. My friend made reservations beforehand. Upon arrival, the outside of restaurant was not too appealing and inviting but that did not shun me away. 

Once inside the restaurant (which was not crowded at all) we were greeted by a girl and taken over to our table. The tables and chair seemed like they were donated to the restaurant because there were many mismatched chairs. 

The girl wiped our table and then brought over the banana leaves. She unravelled the leaves and covered the entire table with it. Then she wiped the leaves. 

Another woman came, but this time with food! We started off with a fruit and veggie salad along with 2 slices of blood orange. The salad consisted of shredded mango and carrots. Interesting mix. 

And then, the garlic rice came. The smell of it was just amazing - personally I am not a fan of garlic -but they roasted tiny pieces of garlic and mixed it with the jasmine white rice. They placed the rice in the middle of the table and spread it out into a log shape. Over the rice, the woman placed the grilled seafood, vegetable and meat - there was an assortment of seafood: shrimps, mussels, squid, calamari, two types of fish: tilapia and milk fish, pieces of pork belly, chicken skewers bbq'ed with a slightly sweet sauce, eggplant, okra. 

I liked the spread, and how they divided the food proportioned to the number of people at the table. Pretty much, we each got two of the mussels, one skewer, and 2 pieces of okra. The rest we had to divide ourselves.

The tilapia tasted a little funny and both of our milkfish were a tad bit too salty but edible. 

My friend decided to order turon for us, which is a sweet dessert spring roll - inside was plantain. The spring roll was coated with a syrup on the outside. This was delicious!! 

Overall, the experience was fun! But feel like it is one of those try one-time and never again type of experience."}
{"text":"At the recommendation of a friend, I came here.


Look, if you're into Kamayan, this is the cheapest you're going to find in the city. It's very good. 
On the negative side, you get what you pay for. While the food is amazing, the area is sketchy, the place isn't special and it is basically a hole in the wall. 

But you're talking about great service and great food. Don't come in a group greater than 4 really."}
{"text":"This is my go-to take out place. Their kamayan feast is a must-try. Great deal for the amount of food you get. This place is rather small, be sure to make a reservation prior. Great staff, always fast and accommodating."}
{"text":"Very interesting experience. if you order the feast, you'll have to eat it the traditional Filipino way with  No hands on banana leafs. It's 15$ per person but a minimum of 2 order. That wasn't properly explain as we wanted to share 1, so we forced our self, left some food on the plate and still paid 30$. But if you're super hungry and try something funky. That's the place."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Great value. Lots of food for $15 with the Kamayan feast
- Great and unique experience
- Relatively quick and friendly service 
- Tasted good for the most part

Cons:
- No free parking that I was aware of
- Inside the restaurant was very cramped

Ordered:
$15 Kamayan Feast - Good for the most part. Lots of variety and flavours. 
$1 Turon - Tasty, crispy and sweet dessert. Worth trying out

Conclusion:
Overall I enjoyed my time at Tinuno. The eating experience was definitely something unique. For $15 when ordering the Kamayan feast, you get an array of different seafoods, a pile of rice, types of pork and some vegetables. Food tasted good for the most part. Parts of the fish were dry and it felt like there wasn't enough of the squid, shrimp and clams opposed to the amount of fish we got. Both types of pork were tasty and the garlic rice fragrant and also went well with everything. For dessert, I got the turon, a jack fruit fill fried stick. It was tasty and enjoyable for the most part. 

The food was good for the most part. I would consider Tinuno a place to take people to for the experience and less for the food. The food isn't memorable or tasty enough for me to consider coming back. I would however take a visiting friend here for the experience. I would recommend this place for the novelty. 

Tip: I'd recommend making reservations ahead of time and telling them that your party will be having the Kamayan feast. Our food came out about 5-10 minutes after we sat down! Also forming the rice into a ball shape makes for an easy eating! No spills"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  In my opinion its the best deal in the city for a kamayan feast.  You definitely leave full and wanting to come back!!!  There are tons of pictures on help and you get exactly what is shown on the pictures.  Bring cash just incase their machines do not work.  It will avoid you walking to a cash machine at a convenient store.  $15 + HST.  Great deal!"}
{"text":"A very memorable and affordable way to enjoy a seafood feast. The place was smaller and less fancy than I expected, but how can I complain? Some of their fish was a bit overcooked, but overall a pleasurable experience with only $15/person. All my friends were asking me where this place is after I posted a picture of their food on SNS :)"}
{"text":"Casual spot for a delicious feast where you use a rubbers gloves to eat your food. I had to fight my amigos off for the pork skewers and milkfish, they were too good. Such an affordable and delicious meal with different yummy foods, we all left completely satisfied and the food was relatively healthy from what I could tell. 5 stars, grab some friends and go stuff your faces."}
{"text":"The place was nice and cute, the food was good for the price you pay.

The only downside of the place is the fruit flies.

But overall experience, was good. Worth trying."}
{"text":"It's no frills and an affordable spot with delicious food. The Kamayan feast is a real treat!"}
{"text":"There is only one item on the dine in menu - Filipino kamayan feast! A delicious grilled seafood meal to be shared among everyone at the table and eaten sans utensils! (Gloves are provided)

My meal: grilled whole fish, shrimp, squid, filet of fish (my favourite item!), mussels, pork skewer, okra and eggplant and the BEST coconut rice! 

Everything is grilled very well with just enough seasoning to bring out the natural sweetness!

Notes:
1. Make a reservation.
2. It takes 15-20 mins to prepare the feast.
3. If you go with a minimum of 4 people, they build out your meal at your table, otherwise it arrives all prepped on a board.
4. If you sit inside, it can get very smokey!
5. Eating with your hands makes everything taste better ~ dig in!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best deal in Toronto. $15 and you get all the seafood and fixin's you could possibly hope for.  You eat with your hands but that adds to the charm. 100% will repeat!"}
{"text":"This Filipino restaurant is best known for their authentic, hands-on kamayan feast.

The kamayan feast is a very cool and unique experience. They bring out an assortment of roasted meats, seafood, and vegetables, all over rice on top of a large banana leaf. Then you get to dig in with your hands! They provide plastic gloves if you're squeamish, but for the true experience, skip the gloves and just get a little messy! I personally found many items in the feast under-seasoned, but they also provide a lot of sauces that you can use to spice things up.

The restaurant itself was more bare bones than I expected. It's located on a less-nice street, and the inside isn't anything remarkable. But as long as you're not looking for a fancy meal, the experience is pretty neat. If you're feeling adventurous, check it out!"}
{"text":"If you look past the rough-looking neighbourhood, the hole-in-the-wall feel of the restaurant and the plastic tables, you will be rewarded with a very yummy traditional Filipino Kamayan meal here at Tinuno - this is hands-down the best place in Toronto to do this.

The owner prides himself that his food is traditional, and not fusion like other Filipino restos in the city, and he should be proud - because the food here is great. The kitchen doesn't start cooking your food until they know you are there, because they want the food arriving hot on your table. We are a group of 8 and it took about 15-20 minutes for the food to arrive, which is a totally reasonable amount of time. Other restaurants take much longer for Kamayan.

For $15 per person, you get mango salad, grilled squid, shrimp, pork belly, pork skewer, okra, eggplant, mussels, 2 kinds of grilled fish (tilapia and bangus), all laid on top of a very delicious garlic rice  - you simply cannot beat this and this is an absolute steal. Food tasted great and it was fun to eat with your hands. They even provide gloves if you want them!

The restaurant is packed on a Monday night, which speaks volumes. I would strongly suggest making reservations if you want to do this as a group. Our group of 8 was a tight squeeze in this small restaurant but they made it work.

If you are a serious Toronto foodie, this is simply a must-try!!"}
{"text":"For the amount of food you get at $15, who cares if the place is cramped with no AC! Ok maybe they do have AC but it was still really hot.  

If you like choices and don't like using your hands to eat, then Tinuno is not the place for you.  Although there is only one set of kamayan, it comes with a variety of meat (shrimp, fish, squid pork) and veggies on a bed of garlic rice.  Everything was placed on banana leaves, you are provided with plastic gloves and then just go nuts!  It was fun and the food was good.  Make sure you order the ube ice cream to round off the best kamayan experience in town."}
{"text":"OMG! So impressed! Let me tell you how my first dining experience at Tinuno went....

I love seafood - A LOT! If the maximum amount of love for something is 10 fingers, well, then my love for seafood is 10 fingers! So when I read about Tinuno and their Kamayan meal that encompasses a great deal of seafood, I was sold! And to make that even better, the restaurant is a 10 minute walk away from my place. What?! 

I invited 5 friends to join me for brunch on a Saturday afternoon (12pm), and I called for reservations two weeks before and had no problems with booking for 6 people. The day before the reservation I told them how one of us (ME!) does not eat onions, and seriously, I expected them to fight me over this - because SO MANY restaurants do! But no, not at Tinuno! They were so incredibly kind, understanding and respectful when I made the request to omit the onions, that it almost brought tears to my eyes. You have no idea how much I appreciate such a kind gesture, because I really do hate onions, and it hurts when restaurants try to force me to eat something I hate!

The day of our brunch I was running a little late, and when I arrived my friends were already seated looking all excited with the banana leaves on the table.  Once seated my friends told me how the restaurant had started cooking our meal. 

The food: 

The meal began with a mango salad for each person, followed by garlic rice being spread across the middle of the table and then carefully the following items were stacked on the rice:

Calamari/squid
Pork belly
Pork skewers
Tilapia
Milk fish
Okra
Mussels
Eggplant

AND a drink = all for $15pp

We could not finish all the food, so we were given a to-go container so we could take the leftovers home. 

In Sum:

What a great experience! The meal was delicious, the food was grilled to perfection, the service top notch, the vibe homey and welcoming, and most important of all for me - my friends loved it and can't wait to return! 

Thank you Tinuno for doing such an amazing job! Please don't change!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place with the Mr. after so much prodding and convincing. With too many people saying this place was good made me want to come here soo bad, as I reminisce of home. Made reservations and got seated without a hitch. Food came late though and by then food wasn't really warm. The experience of a boodle fight (Kamayan) is what makes this place known for. Alas the taste of their food isn't to go crazy for. As a Filipino myself I would say the taste to be average, most food lacked a bit more season and flavor than what Filipino food is know for. If you don't cook at home you'll be in for a good treat! if you do live with a perfectionist of a home cook such as myself I think you would side with me when I say, you can do this in the comforts of your own patio / backyard."}
{"text":"4.5 rounded up! 

This place is amazing. I had seen pictures floating around the internet with these mountains of seafood and other amazing things and I just had to check it out for myself and I'm so glad I did. 

I made a reservation, which despite other reviews was actually pretty easy. The restaurant is kind of hidden away off a side street, next to a convenience store but once you've found it, you'll see the familiar mountains of grilled food on everyone's tables. 

We were seated right away without any issues. I told them I had a reservation and I didn't even have to tell them my name, so I'm not sure what the actual reservation process was. We weren't given menus, just a water bottle and after about 10-15 minutes, someone told us our food was coming. It does seem like the bigger parties get a bit more attention, as they were getting their food sooner than us. 

After about 20 minutes, we finally got our food. Like everyone else, we got the kamayan feast. I'm not even entirely sure they serve anything else here but we came for the feast. 

The feast consists of a number of seafood and pork items and some veggies and mango salad on top of a generous serving of garlic rice. I really enjoyed trying all of these items and it was really fun to eat with your hands (there are gloves if you don't want to get your hands dirty). Some of the highlights were the fish, both of the fish pieces were delicious and seasoned. They had a nice grilled flavour and it went well with the garlicky rice. I also enjoyed the pork skewer and barbecued pork.

One of the best parts about this meal is that it's $15! The value is really enormous here, I can't imagine that you can get a better deal anywhere for the quality/portion and variety you get here. 

The service is hit and miss, there were a couple of very sincere people in there, asking us how our meal was, some were a bit more indifferent. 

I notice a lot of large groups coming in, which they have a separate floor for. This is definitely a communal type of meal, it's really fun for a group, but make sure you bring friends you don't mind sharing food with as you handle it all with your hands and on one shared banana leaf. No cutlery or tableware! 

I can't wait to come back with my family!"}
{"text":"I never leave feeling less than satisfied. Don't let the humble decor discourage you. If you come to eat a meal of delicious grilled meats and seafood, it will not disappoint. 
This is a gem of a place. Great food at a great price. Where else can you get a meal of grilled pork two ways, milk fish, tilapia, mussels, shrimp, squid, eggplant, okra, garlic rice and mango salad (for $15)???"}
{"text":"How can you beat an abundance of deliciously grilled seafood and meat for $15?! You can't! 

This place is a total gem! It's always packed in an otherwise somewhat quiet neighbourhood. As soon as you walk in, the smell of sticky garlic rice greets you in the most pleasant way. Every table is lined with the exact same spread: seafood, meat, some veggies (okra and eggplant), mango salad, and that delicious garlicky rice. You eat with your hands, which makes the experience feel all the more authentic! 

This is your place for a budget-friendly, filling meal and great service!"}
{"text":"Best filipino food spot to go for a boodle fight / kamayan style. Good service. Food is excellent, fresh and properly prepared! Great value for the price -$15 per person plus drink included. Most filipino restaurants are just too overpriced in my opinion. My only concern at tinuno is the space inside. Too small and too tight. Seatings and tables definitely needs improvements."}
{"text":"Excited by StyleDemocracy's blog post, a foodie friend and I decided to catch up over this highly-anticipated Kamayan feast at Tinuno. For $15 per person, you get an array of seafood, eggplant, and pork on top of jasmine rice (all placed on top of a banana leaf) with a side of mango salad. As exciting as it was to try a Kamayan feast for the first time, the experience we had fell below our expectations.

Before going, you have to make a reservation for the Kamayan feast. So we reserved a couple of days prior and came on time. Despite having a reservation, we waited for 40 minutes for our meal. Everyone that came after us were brought their Kamayan feast right away. While waiting at our window seats, we were surrounded by 4-5 fully-grown flies. We tried to move seats but unfortunately all the other tables were reserved. One of the employees swatted the flies that were beside me but it was not great knowing that there were a couple still buzzing around. It had us questioning how hygienic the restaurant was. On top of that, food that fell on the floor at the table beside us were not swept up since we arrived until after we got our meal and the mismatched chairs in the cramp space definitely left an unfavourable first impression.

When the food finally came out, our server realized she had forgotten our mango salad. Which would have been fine, if it wasn't for the fact that everyone who were seated after us got their mango salad as an appetizer before the feast came out. We were also not given water, utensils, and napkins. We had to wait for a few minutes while munching away on the pork skewers before we could properly eat our meal.

Overall, the experience at Tinuno had my friend and I leaving in disappointment. The food was good, though I felt that it was a bit cold when it finally came out. We didn't understand why we waited as long as we did for our food, whilst other customers that came later got theirs within a reasonable time and fresh off the pan. If one aspect of the experience was below expectations, that wouldn't have been so bad. However with the accumulation of: long wait, multiple flies at our table, forgetting our mango salad, utensils, napkins, water, and unkempt restaurant, I rate Tinuno lower than I would for overall dining expectations."}
{"text":"$15 per person is such a good deal here. Depending on how big your party is, if you have a lot of people then you definitely get more and you get to try more. For one person, you get garlic rice, two different kinds of fish, mussels, shrimp, pork skewers, bbq fatty pork, mango salad, orange slices, okra and eggplant. Huge feast for people who love to eat. They also do private bookings for large parties as well."}
{"text":"Pains me to write this review because I really wanted to love this place. Service is average, food is disappointing. Probably a one time experience and I would never willingly come back.

Came on Christmas Eve with a group of 7 people, but one person was unable to make it due to the snow.

It also took over 11 phone calls to make a reservation which is pretty ridiculous in my opinion.

When we told the host that our eighth guest would be unable to make it anymore, he basically said, oh well that's too bad you'll have to pay for his food since I've already sent the order to the kitchen. I was pretty displeased with this since they took the order prior to when everyone was gathered at the place. While I understand, I would have thought that they would hold off on making our order since half the party was there.

The ambience was very lacklustre as well. I'm not expecting much, but it felt a little unsettling to be seated in the upstairs area. The best way I can describe it is \"dingy\" comes to mind.

Food-wise, honestly, it was again underwhelming. I was REALLY looking forward to the food here, but everything arrived COLD. Literally nothing on our table was warm which is a huge disappointment since it should've been hot off the grill.

The flavours were pretty okay, but I just couldn't get over the fact that one of the fish meant for 4 people was pretty much inedible. All I could taste was the charcoal and how burnt it was. There was one fish that could've been amazing ... if it was served even remotely heated. Everything else was pretty average and nothing noteworthy worth mentioning. Maybe the chicken skewer, but again, it was cold.

Don't expect anything to blow your mind with how good it is because you'll just set yourself up for disappointment.

I will not be recommending this place to my friends. Overall a mediocre experience that had me wishing we ate somewhere else."}
{"text":"Tinuno is such a unique dining experience, and one that you shouldn't miss if you're in the Toronto area. It's worth it just to say you ate an entire meal with your hands on leaf covered tables. 

The place is fairly well priced for the insane amount of food. If you have a big group, they have a secret upstairs room that seats about 20 and was perfect for my work team. 

Beware: don't go here if you're not an adventurous eater or don't like seafood. There's cuddlefish, full fish (bones and head included), mussles, etc. There's a couple pork items that were great though and the garlic rice is amazing. Our Fillipino friend knew to ask for an off menu item - the adobo chicken - which was spectacular. Also make sure to try the ube ice cream - it's bright purple and delicious. 

A couple things I didn't love: they don't serve any alcohol, they have very limited drink choices (but the mango nectar is awesome), and all water is served in a plastic bottle as opposed to a glass (more wasteful). Overall awesome though!"}
{"text":"Like eating your food with your hands? If you do you'll love it here. Eating off banana leaves is something special. Not only Filipinos come here but it is a favorite local dining for those who live and work downtown. Great find. The good: for $15 per person you get a lot: fried shrimp, oysters, tilapia, milk fish, BBQ pork souvlaki, fried squid, BBQ okra with mango salad on a bed of rice mixed with garlic. Yum. The bad: like any good eatery if you don't reserve before then you got to wait at least 1hour. The ugly: a bit cramped when there's a lot of people. There is a second floor but the restaurant is small regardless. The decor is simple plastic chairs and plastic chairs. But hey if you forgoe this, the food is great...you can get side dishes like spring rolls and BBQ pork (licheon)Tip: call even a day if you have to. Affordability $-$$"}
{"text":"I'll keep this review limited to a series of dos and don'ts:

- Do make a reservation (the word is out, line-ups can be huge). 
- Don't expect to be seated at the time of your reso (reservations are a bit of an abstract concept here, but still better to make one). 

- Do take as many pics as your little heart desires (everyone will be doing it)
- Don't plan to go out right after the Kamayan (you'll be stuffed, you'll also smell strongly of charcoal). 

- Don't come to this place alone (sharing is caring)
- Also don't come in a group larger than 4! 

- Don't stuff your face with the sticky rice.
- Do: thank the Yelp gods for pointing you towards an interesting culinary experience. 

Overall, the Kamayan is an experience worth having. The Bangus fillet, squid and BBQ items were particularly delicious and the rest of the items were reasonably tasty. This won't be the best seafood you've had in your life, but it will definitely satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"I've seen so many raving reviews about this place but I don't think it lived up to the hype that was generated. The concept of the resturant is really enjoyable, with all the food laid out on large leaves and gloves provided so you can eat with your hands. The food was laid out on top of a bed of rice and included an array of seafood, okra, skewers and a mango salad on the side.

I thought the food was mediocre as a whole. There were definitely some dishes I enjoyed a lot more than others. One of the fish dishes tasted great while the other just tasted like char. I loved the skewers but they had enough for one per person. Overall I don't believe the food justified the $15 price tag per person.

My group consisted of 7 people and the person in charge of calling in had a difficult time connecting to the resturant because their line was always busy. Our reservation was originally for 8 people but we had a last minute cancellation that we told them about at the door. We were still charged for the 8th person because they said the order was already placed with the kitchen. Overall I think it was fun as a one time visit but I would probably not go again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here specifically for the kamayan feast and we were not disappointed!! Who knew that eating with our bare hands would be so satisfying and intimate. Eating with our hands made the dish feel more authentic than it already is. 

The whole platter is served on banana leaves which gave it that extra aroma and flavour. It comes with an assortment of grilled meats and fish, and the best part is (for you health fanatics) is that there is no added sauce (except BBQ pork and garlic rice), salt or MSG on the foods. All the flavour you're getting is straight from the seafood and meat itself. The portion is HUUUUGE for just $15/person (they give you a more than generous amount of food that would fill you up, and trust me, their estimates are so accurate because it will definitely fill you up). The platter comes with these things: 
- grilled bangus
- grilled tilapia 
- grilled calamari (stuffed with fresh chopped veggies snuggled in between the rings)
- pork belly (SO DELICIOUS) 
- pork BBQ (ALSO DELICIOUS)
- mussels 
- shrimps 
- eggplant 
- okra 
- mango salad 
- garlic rice 
Nothing went untouched as it was too good and we finished absolutely everything. We also had a look at their canteen food and it looks really good as well. Gonna have to try it next time we visit. 

The staff were super friendly and kind! They're all super up lifting and extremely happy as the whole time when we were there we heard them laughing and joking non-stop in the kitchen. It just made the vibe of the restaurant even more warm and great. The owner came over to check up on us and we had a great convo with him. The interaction with him made our dining experience even better as he told us the history of the restaurant and the background story of the kamayan dish. 

Just a tip if you want to eat the kamayan dish: the staff offers a hand washing station for after you eat so you don't have to trek all the way downstairs to clean your hands. Also theres cheap parking on Bleeker St underground one of the apartments close by if you can't find meter parking."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of friends and it was quite an experience.. I don't recommend coming here with people you are not close with because you're sharing and eating with your hands. I loved the rice and how fresh their seafood was. It was decently priced as well for the amount of food that you get!"}
{"text":"This is my third time coming here and god the quality is so bad during the weekends.

First of all, we have five people in a table and they only gave us ONE squid. ONE SQUID. and look at another table of two, they have a mountain of meat and SQUID. Also, there were supposed to have 2 mussels/ person. And we have only got 9 mussels for 5 of us. We asked the server for help and she didn't come back. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Not only the portion is too little for five of us, the food was served cold. The quality is not as good as I came during weekdays. When I made the reservation, the server told me that there was a spot for me and I reconfirm it, he suddenly said it's gone and I need to wait 2 hours later to come.

Food comes really late (as usual, probably need to wait for half hour, but I have waited for 1 hour once. 

Overall, I wouldn't come again unless some of my friends really wanna try it. It is a good experience for once but I wouldn't crave for it."}
{"text":"Had dinner with the boys. AMAZING FOOD - traditional kamayan feast. Low key - family kitchen kind of ambiance. Great place for foodies craving a exotic experience. Located in a sketchy neighbourhood - truly a hidden gem. Gerald was the owner - he was also our server. Really nice guy. Highly recommended for low key dinner with friends and/or long time couples. Not recommended for first dates."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the price, the food is good and reliable! My favourite was probably the bbq pork. You should definitely make a reservation ahead of time through the phone- they were packed on a Sunday night at 7pm. Despite making reservations, we were stuck with probably the worst seat in the house, which was right smack in front of the door that kept opening and closing. I think that's the reason our food got cold really quick? But it was piping hot when it was served to us. It also came fairly quickly. If you're afraid of eating with your hands, they provide plastic gloves too! The space is tiny to expect to be bumping elbows. For the price and knowing the type of restaurant it was, I didn't expect over the top and attentive service, which we definitely didn't get. Even paying the bill took ages. For what it's worth, it's a great place to eat for something different and fairly authentic."}
{"text":"Must visit restuarant at Toronto. Great food though long queue. Better to make a reservation."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to have a Kamayan Feast with my friends all these time. Thanks for Elvis A 's invitation, I finally have my first experience at Tinuno!

Reservation is essential as this place is really popular. The evening we were there, there were 2 large groups of 20! And walk in would be turned away.

Kamayan means Hand to Mouth and it is a feast for special occasions. I find it fun to eat with my hands and make a mess. You do have an option to wear gloves if you rather not to handle your food with bare hands (no judgement!)

Tinuno's Kamayan Feast consist of solely food prepared from the grill, seems like the menu is simillar: Fish, Stuffed Squid, Pork Belly, Pork Skewers, Shrimps, Mussels, Okra, Egglplants on top of Garlic Rice and with a side Mango Salad.

Mango Salad and Garlic Rice are both available for refill. And I love the tartness of the salad! It just gave me the will power to eat more!

Minimum order for 2 so bring your friends! More the merrier. The food is good as everything is grilled so not too oily aside from the pork belly and love the grilled taste!

Thanks Tinuno for offering the Kamayan experience as such a reasonable price! At $15 it is just an amazing experience! And the best thing is Every Night is a Kamayan Feast and thus every night is special occasion at Tinuno!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fun way to share a meal! Would come back over and over again. Everything tasted great."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of Sukhothai when it first opened. Although I never tasted Filipino cuisine before, this place feels AUTHENTIC especially the\"handy\" way of eating. The food tasted great, and the price was unbelievably cheap for what I got. No fancy décor, no gigantic pretentious plates (thank God), this place is all about down to earth atmosphere. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Ever watched a show called 'you gotta eat here!'  Well, they forgot to come here because, YOU GOTTA EAT HERE!  

4 of us went for the Kamayan feast which you absolute need reservations for. 

The Kamayan includes grilled bangus, grilled calamari, grilled tilapia, pork belly, pork BBQ, mussels, shrimp, eggplant, okra, mango salad and garlic rice. All that for $15 each is absolutely a steal. 

Even though the restaurant was busy, the waiter who served us was attentive and went out of his way to explain everything after enquiring if it was our first time. He even offered to save us the turon for dessert (read on - that's another story!)

Our meal came quickly and was presented really well, the food is flavourful and you can help yourself to a number of sauces on the side. 

So, when we first got there we saw an actual mountain of turon - there must have been about 100 of them. When the waiter asked if we wanted to save four pieces, I said sure but also thought that it was a little crazy to ask seeing that there were so many. Midway through the meal, people came in and ordered ALL of them and they were gone. Luckily he saved us some and they are truly delicious!

Definitely going back here! Also, even if you don't get the Kamayan, there is a nice take out section as well."}
{"text":"I find this place mediocre. And it's over priced for such simple meals. Too salty and over cooked."}
{"text":"It. Was. So. Fun!

It was my first time eating at a filipino restaurant kamayan style. I honestly had a blast enjoying delicious food while eating with my hands like a baby! 

For $15 per person, they gave a lot of food including 2 different grilled fish (whole btw!), octopus, mussels, pork belly, skewers, shrimp and grills veggies laid over soft jasmine rice. Theres also a tangy mango salad on the side to cleanse your palate in between stuffing your face with everything. Service is quick, but theyre always busy so come with a reservation or risk having to wait!"}
{"text":"Plastic gloves as cutlery? The Experience was refreshingly different. Great seafood; the char from bbq was splendid and seafood presented on banana leaves. This isn't fancy or hipster, it was homey. The server was kind and offered us cutlery, but we went with the gloves. When in rome, do as the Romans do. It was a bit of a wait and shuffle, but glad to have stayed and tried something new for me."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place all month! It's really close to Sherbourne station but the area might be a little scary at night so I would recommend going during the day instead. We got there around 1PM for lunch on a sunday and managed to get a spot, but its recommended to make a reservation. We got the $15/person kamayan feast and it was a ton of food! It came with mango salad, a bed of garlic fried rice, topped with a variety meats and seafood. We were pretty much full for the whole day afterwards.

I wish the location was in a better neighbourhood, and the restaurant was bigger/cleaner, but it's so cheap that it's hard to complain."}
{"text":"Tinuno is a family style, hole-in-the-wall Filipino restaurant. The place is PACKED with individuals across the city to sample this unique Filipino fare on banana leaf. The Kamayan Feast ($15.00 per person) is a bargain. I dragged my brother all the way from Scarborough to experience this seafood feast.  

The Kamayan Feast included grilled bangus (milk fish), grilled tilapia, grilled calamari, grilled pork belly, BBQ pork shoulder skewers, shrimps, mussels, grilled okra, grilled eggplants, garlic rice, mango salad, slices of orange

The two Filipino veteran patrons next to us said they would starve themselves the whole day before visiting Tinuno. They attested to Tinuno's quality and authenticity.  According to them, there are only two places in Toronto that serves Kamayan Feast and Tinuno is superior in every way. They were eating with their hands like pros! We've also learned from our Filipino sensei (they've earned their teacher status now) that garlic rice is unlimited! Heaven rejoice! Juices from freshly grilled seafood merged with the garlicky, savory rice. It was the highlight of the meal. 

Unfortunately, other parts of our meal fell short - calamari was luke warm, tilapia was not fresh, pork skewers were dried, shrimps were overcooked. Tinuno has a lot of potential to deliver an out of the world experience, instead, it missed the mark. 

Overall, our meal was plentiful. We were satisfied with out meal. I was very excited before visiting Tinuno from all the glowing reviews, instead, it was slightly disappointing. There can definitely be a little more love and care put into the food. Hopefully we are an anomaly."}
{"text":"So cheap, and so good!  Seafood was so fresh and everything was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Loved it! We had the Kamayan Feast and it was everything a feast should be. Go with people you are comfortable sharing food with though. I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO EAT? 

Kamayan feast. Priced for a whooping $15, you get a selection of grilled seafood, meats, veggies and mango salad on a bed of rice marinated with garlic and salt lying on banana leaves. What a presentation! And it was really tasty once you dip the food in the different sauces and vinegars that come with the feast. Often ppl say this feast is really easy to make at home, but it's also about the experience when you come to Tinuno. The decor in the restaurant isn't the greatest however you have a group of happy Filipino people ready to serve you. We came when they were about to close but we ended up being hosted by the owner Gerald! If you  ever get to meet him, he's a really guy who will tell you the backstory about how he got started with his restaurant. Tinuno stands for grill in his dialect because Philippines have over 100 dialects. He ended up talking to us while we were having our dinner for the whole night. What an experience and thanks Gerald for telling us about the authentic experience of eating the Kamayan feast!

WHAT NOT TO EAT?

There is nothing else to choose from! So for those of you who have trouble deciding what to get, this restaurant is definitely for you to try!

FINAL TIPS?

Go on days when it's less busy (Tues or Wed night) and when it's later in the night. I went at 8:30 pm so it was not as busy and yet the food still tastes amazing! :)

Also don't forget to dip in the various sauces that the feast comes with. It will definitely heighten your food experience and remember keep your hands occupied on the food and less on your cellphone!"}
{"text":"Make a reservation to avoid the wait!! 

I came on a Saturday night and the place is packed. We had the Kamayan feast (pork belly, 2 fish, squid, mussels, okra, eggplant, pork skewers over a bed of rice, with mango salad) and their tapsilog (beef, egg, and rice). Food came really quickly and their staff were all quick on their feet. They serve everything on the table on a big leaf. 
For the price (~$30 for 2), the value and quality food is great. I can see how they keep the prices down with serving everything on leaves and using gloves instead of utensils. 

My only complaint is the seating. Space is REALLY tight."}
{"text":"The most amazing Kamayan experience I've ever had! I was so full I thought I would throw up and that would have been a waste if I did. For only $15, you get a huge variety of grilled meats and seafood on top of a bed of garlic rice (which was so good!!) with a side of mango salad (so fresh even in Dec) and a drink. The best thing is that you don't need to have a large party to enjoy this as the cost is per person. Be sure to make a reservation, the space is small!"}
{"text":"Tinuno is that exotic village girl, raw and beautiful that comes in your dreams again and again. 

Places like Tinuno are the gems I seek out everytime I venture out on a foodie adventure. This was my first experience with trying Filipino food. I wanted to go where the local immigrants went to get their Kamayan fix. Also important: it should be within my student budget. 

Tinuno ticked off all those boxes and more. Small, no-nonsense, efficient & value for money. You cannot go wrong. I realized oysters arent my thing. The pork and tilapia are to die for. The hot garlic rice makes me swoon everytime I think of it - exactly like my Filipina beauty. The waiters understood we were from a different cultural background and explained everything - with a smile - and gave us a mini education on Filipino food customs. Dont go here expectingan ambience. It's all about the food - and that you get in good measure.

This is my new favorite place in Toronto. Worth every goddamn penny."}
{"text":"Food is pretty top notch here, and have always been impressed with the food. Everyone goes for the Kamayan feast which used to be a great deal but since then they've decreased the amount of food they give you which is a bit disappointing. Food is still great quality though. In terms of service some of the staff have been trained well and some have not as sometimes it seems like they don't really have their act together. It's nothing against the staff as they're quite friendly and doing their best, just haven't been trained really."}
{"text":"So good! Great value! I would come back everyday if it wasn't so far from where I live. The owner is friendly and kind. The service takes a while but expected because of how busy it is. Make reservations first! 10/10 would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Come to Tinuno if you're down to enjoy traditional Filipino grilled meats with your hands, while balling on a budget (starts at $15/person)!

//THE FOOD//
The amount of food was MASSIVE. The meats were simply seasoned with salt & pepper and laid on top of a bed of garlic rice. The pure pork & seafood flavours really got to shine because of this. I also opted for a $15 add-on of the traditional Roasted pork belly which was totally worth it!
My favourite was the milkfish (although very salty) and the crispy juicy roasted pork belly. I found the Tilapia fish tasted too fishy though. The mango salad and orange was a nice finish to the meal too. They don't serve water so be prepared to pay for drinks (~$2). 
TIP - How to eat rice with your hands:
1) Wear the gloves they give you 2) gather a small amount of rice and scrunch & press it down on the table to make a small mound 3) pick it up with your thumb, index & fingers finger 4) pop it into your mouth with your thumb!

//ATMOSPHERE//
Make sure you call in to make reservations in advance, it's always packed since it's such a small space. They serve everything on top of banana leaves (but it was just for show since it wasn't even fragrant)."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try kamayan at Tinuno. The Kamayan Feast ($15/person) is a traditional Filipino meal usually reserved for special occasions and consists of a variety of food that is presented on large banana leaves and eaten family style with your hands - no plates; no utensils. 

I made reservations earlier in the day for 7:30pm but our table was not ready when we arrived. We were asked if we were willing to sit outside and we agreed but were still not seated until 8pm. We were told that our order had been put in before we were seated so that we would not have to wait long for our food but it was not ready until 8:30pm. The host was really nice and apologetic but I was a little irked as I saw others who had arrived later, be seated and receive their food at least a half hour before ours was ready. 

For our meal, a generous portion of sticky garlic rice was spread out and shaped in a line on the banana leaves and then the grilled seafood (squid, bangus belly, tilapia, mussels, shrimps), meat (bbq pork, pork belly) and veggies (okra, eggplant) were laid out on top of it. Each person also had their own portion of mango salad laid out in front of them. 

All the food here comes straight off the grill and has a smokey flavour to it. My favorite was the bbq pork skewers as it was covered in a delicious banana ketchup. Not being a huge fan of bbq myself, I found the meal to be smokey but not overwhelmingly so. However, I did find the skin on the fish to be a little on the salty side and it's probably best to eat the rice with it in order to tone down the saltiness. As well, because the seafood is grilled, it does lose some of its sweetness and moisture. 

Overall, Kamayan is a fun way to share a meal with friends. The presentation is especially spectacular when you have a large party (we saw a party of over 15 people being served as we were about to leave). I would probably come back if I had friends visiting the city and wanted to introduce them to something new but personally, I wouldn't come back on my own as I found the food just ok. But for the price it really is quite a deal."}
{"text":"Gréât food and awesome ambiance. Make sure you reserve ahead of time before coming. It's also possible to pick up the food and eat it home. However, you won't have the unlimited garlic rice"}
{"text":"Tinuno was definitely at the top of my list for trying new experiences, and should be at the top of yours if you have not tried it yet. We came as a large group and ordered the Kamiyan feast, which is a line of rice with proteins such as shrimp, mussels, lots of fish, pork belly, skewers, squid, and more. This 3 meter long dinner was a sight to be held with beautiful banana leaves and fresh mango salad that adorned each guest's spot. It was also extremely reasonable at about $17 per guest which includes a drink. If you do not like seafood, I would be wary of coming because most of the feast is that. You eat with your hands and it is quite a fun experience of sharing and laughing with your buddies. 

So why not 5 stars? Ambience was almost nil. It is a small, shady looking store that works like a takeout restaurant as well as a dine-in, so a bunch of people are standing around closely while people are eating, and let's just say it's not the prettiest. The tables were the foldable grey plastic kind and I'm sure they have their own reasons, but it definitely took away from the atmosphere. Washrooms were a horror. Unclean.
Service was also to be desired. There was only one waiter who was doing literally everything and service suffered because of that. No checkups, had to get up and get our own drinks from the fridge, not really welcoming, etc. Small things make a difference. 

To conclude, I give this place a 3.5/5. The experience was neat and the pork belly/skewers/rice were delicious, but the other aspects let me down a little. I do recommend this place though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend LOVES this place and wants to give a 5/5 for its uniqueness and value for money. 

This is an unbeatable price for Kamayan ($15 PP). The portions are HUMONGOUS, I came here right after running a 10K race and couldn't even finish everything. Also, the bathrooms are surprisingly modern and clean!

If this place did a few things better it would definitely be a 5. The service was not really there. They were slow to get our orders, we didn't have full condiments at our table, and our waitress never came to refill water. Our fish was also super burnt, and there wasn't much flavour to the octopus, okra, and eggplant. But for the price, it's totally reasonable."}
{"text":"I give Tinuno 3.5/5 stars. Really enjoy experiencing the Philippine culture here and at 15$/person, it is quite a good deal. The food itself is average in my opinion, I would go back for the experience and not necessarily the food itself"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service...and even better prices. Totally unique experience. Stand out restaurant and total gem for the area."}
{"text":"Super casual, family owned, tiny restaurant with outstanding food! Went for group 'kamayan' dinner for 6. A great deal at $15 per person. You get mounds of delicious food. Would definitely recommend to anyone who loves filipino food or is trying for the first time."}
{"text":"Tinuno was such a fun experience. It took me three tries before I was able to secure a reservation here.

Attempt 1: Called several times before someone actually picked up. Tried to make a same day reservation but they were fully booked.

Attempt 2: Called on a Monday for a Saturday dinner reservation. Got through on the second try this time but the only time slot they had was for 4:00pm, which leads me to...

Attempt 3: Ended up booking for the following Saturday at 7pm for 4 people. I was able to change this to 7 people a couple days prior to the reservation without any issue. I informed them that we were going to be ordering the Kamayan Feast (a tip I read on here!)

We got street parking pretty easily, I was surprised since it was a weekend. There were lots of people waiting for a seat. As we had reservations, it didn't take too long before we were seated and the salad / garlic rice were served soon after. The grilled stuff took a little longer but that's understandable.

The service wasn't the best but you can tell they're trying to do the best they can. There are a lot of staff but they're very busy. Try to think of everything you'll need in the very beginning and ask for it then (i.e., gloves, straws, extra cup if you're sharing drinks, sauce cups etc). The first thing they did when we sat down was take our drink order but the feast was ready before we got our drinks and we had to remind them again.

I must say, the ventilation here SUCKS and I thought our jackets and scarves would smell for sure, but it didn't. The place looked smokey and they had to prop the doors open with a chair at one point, but we sat by the door and it was so cold for us that we had to shut it : (

Overall, the meal was good but I think what makes it great is the experience (does everything just taste more delicious when you eat with your hands?) My favourite was the squid. I would've loved a beer with this meal but they don't serve alcohol. Mango juice & coconut water is $2.00. Soft drinks are $1.50. Gratuities are included (10%) in the bill. I would 100% recommend trying this out if you haven't been yet!"}
{"text":"This little hidden gem rocks.  I absolutely loved it.  I will have to go back and try other delicious looking dishes. Very friendly, small place but perfect for any occasion. 

See you again soon!"}
{"text":"I've read about this place and had it bookmarked for a long time. The food looks so spectacular, I ordered takeout for vegetarian friends coming over. It didn't disappoint, the food is very fresh and the flavours were unusual and exotic for me. Not the best quality of fish, I think it's just tilapia, but the whole presentation and the overall impression were very satisfying. I will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Best experience in Canada and the most memorable. The meal helped us make new friends and we've been recommending this place to others when we hear they are visiting Canada. The environment is very family like and that's welcoming. The location is so small for such a place that gets so much love and so many customers. I would definitely go back and enjoy this warrior meal!!"}
{"text":"Exotic and a fun and unique concept for dining.

Everyone here has talked about the Feast option for $15/person so I won't elaborate but I'd love to add that their service is also awesome when I went.

Call ahead and make a reservation and try to stay away from the busiest times for the best service (they don't have many people working there). 

Come in a big group (6-8 people) for the best experience! Sometimes they have deep fried plantains for dessert... get it.

It's not for everyone, if you don't like getting dirty and intimate with your food, probably not your spot."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! We waited an hour to get served. this place also has limited seating, tight and very hot; I would not recommend this place to anyone.."}
