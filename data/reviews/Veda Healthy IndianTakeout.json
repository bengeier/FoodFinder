{"text":"My favourite Veda location! The food is served hotter here, there's more of it and the service is the best. 

As a campus foodspot, I would even consider giving it five stars, given the limited and unremarkable options. Four stars is more accurate though. 

I come here for the curry bowls and samosas. A small curry bowl is sufficient for the average eater, but large does exist to satiate additional hunger. For the amount of food, the pricing is very fair -- $6 for a small bowl, and a dollar and change more for a large. I haven't tried all the curries yet, but the chicken curry, veggie curry and lentils are all tasty. Some of the curries do tend to be a tad acidic (from tomatoes, perhaps?), but it's not noticeable enough to be off-putting. 

The samosas, like all the food actually, is not greasy at all. The pastry is more similar to a thicker, tastier jamaican patty pastry than the usual fried pastry. There are veggie and chicken options, and the samosas are crammed with fillings. I also like that they heat it with an actual oven before it's given to you to ensure that it's hot and crisp. 

I think Veda strikes a fair balance between healthy cooking and flavour. While it certainly may not taste like your usual Indian fare, the food is very enjoyable nonetheless."}
{"text":"Ordered a Curry Chicken, Saag Paneer and Vegetable Basmati Rice Tiffen box that came with a small potato salad, naan and a soft drink. I was rather hungry and was especially craving for some healthy Indian food, unfortunately, the flavours were unappetizing and the preparation of the food was absolutely displeasing. To elaborate further, the rice I doubt was even seasoned as it was extremely bland even when mixed with the either the saag paneer or curry chicken, the Saag Paneer tasted no different from tomato soup, and the curry chicken was dressed with a distasteful short white hair; plus, everything but the naan was cold... one star too much..."}
{"text":"In short: Decent Indian take-out for a fair price. 

You can't go wrong with a small curry bowl combo (don't let the word \"small\" discourage you from ordering - you get A LOT of food). 

The curry bowls feature two heaping servings (I can vouch for the tofu butter and veggie curry) on a mound of rice with naan and a drink for under $10."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and I really like Indian food, so I actually ventured all the way into the basement of the Sandford Fleming building to find this place bc I wanted to know all the Indian lunch spots around campus.

Pros:

- I actually think this is better than Cumin (the Indian spot in Robarts library)

- Portions are decently sized and priced a couple bucks cheaper than the equivalent at Cumin

- Service lady was nice, at least on the day I visited

Cons:

- Awful location - why is the food court at Sandford Fleming so depressing??
- Naan isn't really naan, it's a pita bread. Definitely not the same thing!!!! And much less yummy :(
- no Tcard discount here
- the only other reason I might come here over Cumin is bc they are on Ritual, for the points, but when I visited they weren't taking Ritual orders :(
- Veda slaw is just coleslaw, nothing Indian about it..and not very good :p

Sad because the food I think is actually decent (just don't get the pita or the slaw), but it's way too much trouble to go into the basement of this building. Probably won't come again."}
{"text":"Thank UTFS (U of T Food Services) for VEDA

VEDA is one of the only locations on campus where I feel I can find reliable, healthy, and yummy food that is filling and doesn't break the bank. The SF location is also probably the biggest and best location on campus.

Samosas are about $1.50, a bowl with rice and two curries/dishes will cost you about $6 (and is very. filling), and the empanadas are something over $2. All are tasty and come highly recommended - especially since they are relatively healthy, quite filling, and don't come with the greasy bloatedness I've learned to associate with a filling Indian meal.

Also, they are super vegetarian friendly. Perhaps as veg-friendly as it gets, without being exclusively veg.

I will continue to come regularly, and will even miss VEDA when I am off campus."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm fairly impressed (for what it is).

I really enjoy their samosas, as well as their curries. I usually get the small curry bowl ($5 all in!), with rice, and two curries (I get the mixed veggies and chicken curry usually.) I'm a big eater, and it's usually enough (sometimes it's more than enough!)

They accept debit, and provide inexpensive and relatively healthy food on campus. They also provide nutritional information (http://vedatakeout.com/index.php?cmd=nutrition)

It's a 4 star campus servery, and a 3 star \"real life\" eatery.  (Atmosphere leaves much to be desired... I'd take the food elsewhere.)"}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber Eats and the food arrived at a reasonable time. It is mediocre tasting Indian food at best. Chicken curry tasted like the frozen version available at most grocery stores. Palak paneer was better tasting but could be frozen too. The basmati rice biryani was fresh and tasted excellent. 

After having tasted Indian food at most restaurants in Toronto, I can now understand why it isn't popular. These restaurants fail miserably at delivering the real taste of India."}
{"text":"We went on the recommendation of a friend from India, who was part of our group.  He eats at Veda all the time and told us that it was A-OK.  Indeed it was!

I got a large curry bowl to go ($8).  There were three choices of rice for the bottom of the bowl and about six possible toppings -- you get to select two of those.  My lunch was copious, to say the least.

I agree that the eating area is not very uplifting.  We walked to another building with our takeout and enjoyed our lunches in peace and quiet."}
{"text":"Their food can be a little bland at times but it's one of the less expensive indian takeouts in the area so it's still worth it."}
{"text":"It's not comparable to actual indian restaurants, but this is more or less my favorite place to eat on campus. It's especially good when you've gotten sick of all the subway, burger king, etc. Feels more like actual meal food and not so much like junk fast food."}
{"text":"What a horrific experience for delivery. I ordered the food at 7:40pm and recieved it at 9:15pm. And the food is ice cold and soggy. I can't comment on the quality because it's a cold mush. I can't believe how terrible this experience has been."}
{"text":"Picked up a snack naan from here one late afternoon for $1.75. Their curry bowls and burgers are okay too, nothing that special. They do have mango lassis in addition to fruit and such, but those are more expensive and generally not worth it.

Okay for a quick snack, but there are better alternatives for meals nearby instead."}
{"text":"This one is mostly for my peeps at UofT! 

Was treated to a super tasty lunch today. My coworkers surprised me with a curry bowl from Veda. It was full of delicious spices, very fresh, and felt healthy! Definitely going to be cycling this into my regular lunch spots."}
{"text":"This isn't really 'Indian' but Indian inspired. The huge difference between Veda and other places is the omission of excessive grease, which I really appreciate. I also like the that dishes are labeled Vegan and Gluten-free. There's nothing special about the taste, but the other attributes make up for this."}
{"text":"1. they take debit cards
2. you can get a filling  meal (small bowl) for about 5 bucks
3. a \"currito\"  is two meals for me
4. not the greatest indian food, but its not the worst either. it's not trying to be authentic (i mean, they're making indian burritos!) but its delish. 
5. try the garlic dips and mango dips! 

as far as campus food goes...its the BEST."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their idea and I'm glad they're serving proper food within the campus however their execution falls flat.

This location is in the basement of the Sanford Fleming building (for Engineering students at UofT) and most of their customers are grabbing lunch in between class, which means it needs to be quick and filling.

I ordered their Tandoori Roti Wrap and I was waiting for nearly 10 minutes for it!! Not to mention I bit into a chicken bone when having the sandwich.

Most of my friends I've spoken to never really liked the food they served (very bland, lack good flavour like Indian food should and take waayy too long to make). Even their smoothies aren't real smoothies.. they're more like juice.

I applaud them for everything they are TRYING to do (fresh, healthy, inexpensive food), I just wish they could fix this up and serve some good stuff for the students. I know I'd be going down there everyday if that were the case."}
{"text":"Channa masala FAIL:

I've given Veda a try twice now and found it rather disappointing both times.  Maybe the problem was that I went towards the end of the lunch hour both times?

The channa masala had clearly been in the steam tray for a while...it had that luscious texture of cardboard.  Also, shockingly for a vegetarian Indian dish, it was rather flavourless...the flavours of coriander, garam masala, chill, ginger which normally turn chickpeas into something more than well, chickpeas, were totally absent.  The channa masala was piled on top of rice which had also clearly been in a warmer for quite a while, gradually becoming dry and crispy.   

On my second try, I had the lentil curry...slightly fresher than the channa masala fail, but also quite a bit on the bland side.  Are they scared of spice at an Indian restaurant?

The ATMOSPHERE is, well, a bit depressing...subterranean cafeteria.  The STAFF are reasonably friendly.

I like the idea that they're trying to do something cheap and healthful...not often an option in the college cafeteria; however, they really should step up the spice and care with which they serve their food.  If they've held the food long enough that it has become visibly desiccated better to throw it out than serve it to an unsuspecting customer."}
{"text":"Veggie empanada is tasty good size
Lemon square is delicious too! 
Veg springroll was a let down though"}
