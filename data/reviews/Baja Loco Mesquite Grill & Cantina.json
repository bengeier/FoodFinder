{"text":"Baja loco: good food, nice staff, great atmosphere, my favorite is the grilled fish tacos, along with the margarita, it makes a great meal."}
{"text":"The Mesquite Shrimp Tacos are spot on! There is nothing more satisfying than a slice of Baja on a Friday."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming one of our favorite places to eat.  The foods great, the beer is cold, and the staff is very friendly and helpful.    The fish tacos are excellent.  We've recently tried the baja loco tacos, they are beef chorizo/ground beef they are great.  The serve yourself chips and salsa bar is very nice.  Although, I do wish they had more of a variety of salsa."}
{"text":"We had  baja loco cater our anniversary party..Jason  was such a help..We got so much food..great leftovers..It made it so much easier..they packed it so well.If you need great food check with Jason..Good food ..great prices...Remember them for parties..holidays..give them a try.."}
{"text":"So yummy highly recommend the shrimp tacos very great beans and rice and of course it's a bar. I've eaten here twice and would come back when in the area"}
{"text":"On my way home and wanted something more than fast food. Loved the rugged, distressed look of the place - like a beach side restaurant in Mexico. Large quantity of food for the price. Had the pork burrito (it was good), but will try something else due to the responses of others on yelp. Unlimited chips/salsa bar was great also. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We go to lunch at Baja Loco every week. The staff always greets you and says bye as you leave and has remembered us since our just our first few visits.   The daily specials are all pretty good. Two of our favorite items are the Chile Burro and the Grilled Shrimp Tacos. The Tri-tip beef is also good. And, you have to love the unlimited chips and salsa bar.   The atmosphere is comfortable and casual and I just wish we didn't have to go back to work because the drinks are so affordable. PBR, baby!"}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service. You order at the counter, but a server came to our table to take our drink orders. They have decent cheap margaritas. They also have a chip and salsa bar that is self serve. The salsas were cold and tasted fresh, some with quite a kick. The chicken they grill here is good (you can watch them do it through the glass kitchen wall), very flavorful and juicy. The rice and beans were ok too. This is not a fancy place (plastic plates and utensils), but it is clean, good, quick and inexpensive. It also seems a bit healthier then your traditional Americanized Mexican food drowning in cheese and grease.  Kid friendly, easy parking...check it out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place one Sunday while driving around, passing time and looking for cheap Margaritas!  This is the place for that!  @2.75 margaritas during Happy Hour.  $3.75 during regular hours.  Who can compliant right?!  My point exactly!  Both times I've been I ordered the combo fajitas (whitefish and shrimp).  They're excellent!  My boyfriend ordered the grilled zucchini for an appetizer and finished with the Grande Burrito... both excellent!  We had the pleasure of meeting some of the owners during our first visit here.  They were really, really cool, fun and nice!    Give it a shot you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"My favorite is the Mesquite grilled fish salad in a taco shell.  Ummmm!"}
{"text":"It's ok! The whitefish taco was pretty good, the tri-tip street taco was ok, the pork street taco was good! Overall I had better! I need to stop watching top chef, my standards have increased! Ha ha ha"}
{"text":"awesome food, great service. had so much food, we took some home. i love the interior. small problems like no lids for salsa cups, so coulnd take any home. but an amazing place. the chicken and beef was amazing, even my picky son loved there tacos."}
{"text":"if you loved chuy's you won't be disapointed. Even a few additions to the menu. Once again great friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch. Try the chicken grande burrito with green chile sauce, enchilada style - unbelievably good!! Great portions, and a nice laid back atmosphere inside."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place..at least concerning my order. It was already happy hour when I arrived for lunch at 2pm, but nobody told me or I might have had something different. Regardless of that, I ordered the California tacos and they were overflowing (I mean I could not even pick up my taco until I ate some with my fork) with grilled seasoned white meat chicken, a slice of avocado, cheese, lettuce, but mostly chicken. A $7.99 order included two tacos, some good, but salty pinto beans and a pretty decent Mexican rice. You order at counter and the cashier will bring your order. They have a chips and salsa bar that you help yourself too and the chips were tasty. I did not try any of the hotter sauces, but the pico salsa at the bar, despite being a tad watery, did the trick. A better version of pico was found buried under taco number two. This was a good lunch, but check for happy Hour deals from 2-6 and if you don't like dark meat watch out because most of their stuff is pulled chicken, but you can substitute white meat."}
{"text":"Best resonabaly priced fish in town. I LOVE their fish fry special on Friday, and their grilled fish on Wednesday. Cheap beer, the best $3 Margaritas ever, and a staff that really puts forth an effort. Free chips and salsa bar too. I've been a regular every since they opened and have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't Yelped about Baja Loco.  I've been eating at this restaurant since it was Chuy's, at different locations starting in 2000. They got into trouble I guess, and then disbanded and now a few of the old Chuy's are different restaurants.  Baja Loco on 32nd and Camelback is the absolute best. My boyfriend and I eat here an awful lot. I think one week we went 4 times! It's a neat kind of restaurant as far as decor goes, and they've usually got a few different games playing on the number of TV's they have.   Why are we repeat customers?  In short, whatever they grill their seafood in is highly addictive.  The food is insanely cheap. On average, we usually spend $20 total (plus tip) with two meals and two alcoholic drinks. Make sure the manager pours your drinks, he's the best there. But regardless of who pours, they are not by any means light-handed. My favorite drinks are their Baja on the Rocks (which is basically a Mai Thai) or a Mudslide. I got it with I think smores vodka once and it was sooo good. They carry an assortment of beers too, and their house lemonade (non-alcoholic) is nice as well.  The food is awesome. My boyfriend almost always orders the whitefish skewers. Last time, he ordered the chicken wings. I've probably eaten everything there. The tri-tip sandwich is one of my favorites, followed by the shrimp fajitas.  My family eats there sometimes, though nowhere near as often as we do. My brother swears by the veggie burrito, which is probably bigger than his vegetarian arms.  Now that I've moved out of Arizona and into a place that seriously lacks any kind of dining, I really miss Baja Loco."}
{"text":"I am devastated. My family eats at Baja Loco at least 2 times a week. It's our favorite restaurant and we never feel guilty eating there because it's so healthy. Breaks my heart knowing that the awesome people working there will be out of a job soon. LET'S SAVE BAJA LOCO!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We really like this place. Everyone is friendly and we've been going since back when it was Chuy's. Great tritip, chips and salsa are self serve and delicious. Low key great food and good prices."}
{"text":"I've been going here ever since I moved to the Arcadia area and I can't say one bad thing about it. Food is great, atmosphere is fun and the staff is always nice. Try the Tortilla soup - had for the first time and it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Friends and I visit this place every week, regularly.  They always remember us and hook us up.  When they ran out of our favorite brew (it was seasonal) they turned us on to the newest one!  Can't beat it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about seven years (before the Chuy's scandal!!!). I love it. There are a couple things I miss from the old menu (hot shrimp, Chuy's sampler), but everything is still great. I venture out once in a while and try the specials. This place can get pretty expensive quick (I usually drop 20 bucks on my lunch alone), but the food is good quality. Staff are very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Didn't care for Baja Loco. The decor is fun but that's about it. I mean, I guess the price for lunch wasn't bad. At the counter you can build your customized lunch; either burrito or taco bowl or tacos with the meat, fixings, and sauces of your choosing. And the salsa bar is included too. All for $6.99. Not bad, you are thinking? But let me tell you about the salsa bar. The chips were not warm and toasty. Actually, they resembled a bunch of broken pieces from the bottom of your bag o 'chips. And there were only 2-3 selections of salsa. Really didn't taste fresh either. My burrito was alright. Had shredded chicken you could find just about anywhere, gushy and starchy rice, and your typical iceberg lettuce. Nothing special. The taste? As bland as bland can be. Not sure how the $6.99 measures when you can't enjoy anything on your plate. No thanks, I'll pass on Baja Loco."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and it was GREAT! I use to go to Chuy's at Metro Center and they had great food! I had a Doctor appointment near this location today and the old manager at Metro Jason was the manager here today! Great Food,Great Service! Try it you will like it. Gary I live in Glendale Arizona but it was worth the trip to this location! This review shows I live in Dallas but I don't?"}
{"text":"Awesome tri-tip tacos.  The wife loves the fish skewers. Good prices and good food. Huge bar and lots of TV's.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Popped in for take-out and enjoyed the chicken salad.  Large slices of avocado, large slices of tomatoes, the chicken was cooked reeeally well.  It was a nice lunch.  I did get a side of mesquite zucchini and it came on top of a tortilla and a bit of cheese on top.  I preferred the zucchini without the extra grease and fat but oh well....now I know.  They had a serve yourself chips and salsa bar.  Next time I'm in the area I'll order something with a bit more substance.  I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"I can't say enough how much I love this place, every time we go we fall in love with it more and more. Recently went on a Thursday night, staff is friendly as always and fun to talk to. The food comes out quickly, fresh, and looks so good you can't wait to eat up! My husband and I love to come here with the kids or with friends later at night, drinks are cheap and good and the pitcher of Margarita can't be beat :) It's not fine-dining but it is a fun and laid back place, great spot to sit and talk and really enjoy the food and the company you have with you. You won't see bored, sad faces staring at their phones here! Burritos are enough food for two, great deal....the wings have a great sauce and are meaty...the one burger on the menu hits the spot...chicken tenders are huge and filling, not the crap you get from fast-food or even other diners/restaurants."}
{"text":"This place has a quirky set-up but its really great for big groups. It's one of those places you want to go to watch sporting events with your drinking buddies. The beer selection is just average and the fook was just okay.   It was a Sunday after church and we got everything at happy hour prices even though we were early. The wait staff was really very nice and the place felt clean.   There was also a salsa bar. I could have just eaten chips and been fine.   This is not a place I would have picked to eat but you really can't argue with family. Not moms anyways.   Try it if you must."}
{"text":"I give this place a minus - 1 star!! This was our first time there and the lady working there was RUDE and never came to our table to ask if we needed anything!! She was the only one serving too!! Too bad.. When I went up to the counter she took forever to help me or refill my soda!! To top it off after I got home I checked my bank account and saw she gave herself a $5.44 TIP!! I wouldn't have left her a penny!! I will not be going back!! Too bad for whoever has to put up with her!! NOT ME!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a filling and tasty meal. The place is full of junky or as people like to say these days \"distressed\" decorations... gives the place a laid back charm, I suppose.   I have been here twice, and both occasions were after doing some hardcore housework. It was so great to have a big yummy lunch after all the hard work I did. The combo plates are super -  good portions and everything is served hot and fresh! I love the grilled whitefish! It is so tender and well seasoned!  They also have a well stocked bar and great drink and beer specials.   Too bad I won't ever be able to go here again... I live in LA and I probably won't ever end up in Phoenix again. Oh well."}
{"text":"Good go to for a quick lunch. Everyone always finds something delicious that they enjoy. My favorite is the California Tacos. The boy always gets a quarter chicken and we eat everything on the plate. Great place for quick eats."}
{"text":"I thought it would be interesting when I walked up to the counter and I saw the bald white guys behind the counter in the kitchen.  Turned out I was right.  It was American food disguised as Mexican food, very bland.  Meet was dry. The salsa bar was for decoration and not for consumption.  I asked the cashier if there are known for tacos or burritos.  She said they're not known for anything. No joke.  It really sucks that I have to be this negative about any business that may possibly be trying.  At the same time I feel that this review is necessary for public service."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place, nice quiet environment and great service . The salsa bar is not to bad, I would say order a side of the green sauce to dip the chips in, also happy hour gets some okay deals going."}
{"text":"Had the grilled seasoned fish sandwich, best fish sandwich I have EVER had! The  help yourself Salsa Bar is awesome, homemade chips just the way I love them light and crispy.  When they set down the sandwich they also gave me a whole squeeze container of Baja Sauce, I almost cried. It went on the sandwich, I squeezed some in my salsa and mixed it up.  Service was good, food was speedy, atmo is chillaxin cantina style, great price point. I will be returning a lot!"}
{"text":"I am unclear on why the reviews of this place are so negative. Perhaps we caught them on a good day or service is steadily improving.   3 of us ordered the Sunday special - cheeseburger with choice of fries, chili or salad. Everything was exactly the same as back when the location was Chuy's. Big, tasty grilled burgers with a good amount of cheeses and a soft buttery bun. Pickles, lettuce and tomato slices on the side. I got my burger \"California style\", with bacon and avocado and asked for some Baja sauce. It was a really decent burger for the price. My chili side was a little bland but I shared some of my son's ranch style fries and they were tasty. The 2.75 bloody mary's were nearby to wash down the meal. I do miss the Sunday make yourself bloody mary bar, but was happy to see the serve yourself chips and salsa remained.  I am sure we will return to take advantage of the amazing daily happy hour specials. We were so sad to see Chuy's go - glad to discover it is still in the valley under a new name. The staff were pleasant to talk to and confirmed that this location and one other off Indian School are now owned by ex Chuy's employees and that they kept the same format and recipes."}
