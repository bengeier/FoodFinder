{"text":"Last week me and my friend was eating at Gio's Cafe and I was really surprised how good and fresh their food. Pasta Marinara was awesome. My friend was eating Alaskan  crepe and he said its bomb, so good. We definitely will comeback:)"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place. We waited over an hour for delivery on a Sunday night and all we ordered was a salad and a couple appetizers.  The apps were cold and tasted as if they'd been sitting out the entire time we were waiting for them. To top it off they forgot our drinks. Won't order from here again."}
{"text":"Small cafe serving delicious crepe! They have a lot of good savory crepe options and the grilled chicken and mushroom is my favorite. I've also tried the Spicy Sriracha Steak and it's also great! Of course their Sweet crepes are good too but sometimes inconsistent on the fruit filling.  If you happen to be in downtown or looking for a food a delivery, this is a must try and I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best take out salad I've had in the city. What a surprise this place has been! Call it in. They are made from scratch. Sweet berries, seasoned chicken, shaved sharp gorgonzola, plenty of dressing, lots of different fresh greens!! Yum! I'll be back soon :D"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Super delicious crepes! Service is awesome and friendly!! Recommend you to choose this place and try))"}
{"text":"Awesome Crepes and Sandwiches!! Was impressed with the sandwich I ate yesterday so we decided to come back for breakfast. Will definitely come back again when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"After being on the road for a few hours, I was looking forward to trying this place. Unfortunately, my family and I arrived and the cafe had a sign on the door that said \"be back in 7 minutes.\" Lights were on, door was locked. I didn't mind waiting, but after 15 minutes of waiting on the street, we decided to go somewhere else. I even called the cafe a few times hoping someone may just be in the back. I just recommend that the next time it is around 5 pm on a Tuesday, with a Beyoncé concert happening in a couple hours, that their be someone in the store. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Quiet little diner/crepe shop.  Reasonable prices - coffee and crepe or sandwich under $10.  Visited here twice on a 3 day trip downtown,  no wait, friendly service.  Just a short walk to river/ stadiums/ other hot downtown spots.  Perfect way to start the day."}
{"text":"Excellent Savory crepes, and fast service - only lunch place in downtown that is this good and this fast.  I got ham with horshradish crepe for lunch and it was $8 and came with a salad."}
{"text":"Ordered crepes for lunch delivery and they were a pleasant change from pizza, sandwiches and salads. Reasonable delivery time. A little pricey, but like I said,  a nice change. Online ordering was easy, delivery dude and manager were both pleasant. Would definitely order again."}
{"text":"This was a well deserved 2 star experience. Delivery was about 45 minutes (about the average in my area), but the food was a weird temperature. Not hot, not cold, but right in the middle. And I mean everything was right in the middle. The bread, veggies, and meat were all room temperature. I couldn't tell if it was toasted or thawed, which isn't' a good problem. They also brought the wrong drink, but that's a minor mistake.   I ordered the Gio's Club Sandwich. It was supposed to come with \"homemade ranch dressing,\" but nope, just a quarter cup of mayo. Room temperature mayo at that. The sandwich was bland but edible.   To get to Grubhub's minimum order limit of $10, I also grabbed the \"garlic bread with cheese.\" It was lightly buttered bread with sprinkled cheese on top, also at room temperature. Technically it met the bare minimum requirements to be considered garlic bread, but man, there was zero effort involved. I took two bites of the garlic bread and the trash received the rest.   If this meal was a student, it would be a C student. Not great, not terrible, just forgettable. It didn't make me mad or sick, it fed me me an adequate portion of food, and it was delivered in an tolerable amount of time. It's the definition of \"meh.\""}
{"text":"This was such a disappointment. The pasta was actually disgusting. There was one spoon of sauce on it, not even enough to mix throughout the dish. The pasta was dry and the cheese was hard. The \"garlic bread\" was simply toast, and they did not even include utensils or napkins.  I would never come back here. When I called to discuss my order the worker was rude and hung up on me."}
{"text":"Went here for the good reviews, but the service here makes me vow that I would never go back; not only did they hear my order wrong but they almost sent me out the door with only half the stuff I ordered. More than disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic service,food,prices and they deliver downtown! :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate lunch there today!!!  Absolutely delicious food!!!  The best sandwich and fries town!  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for a long day at the office afternoon snack.   I've had both a savory (Spinach, tomato and mushroom) and sweet (berry) crepe, and they were both delicious and reasonably priced. The vegetables in the savory crepe were well cooked, and the sauce was creamy and tangy. It came with a nice little side salad coated in a simple, but tasty, vinaigrette. The berries on the sweet crepe were all flavorful, and it was exactly what I needed to get me through the remainder of my long day. The crepes themselves are perfectly cooked and have that weird stretchy fluffiiness that a good crepe should have. Both plates were plated nicely, which is always a bonus. You can tell that they want to produce yummy food.  I definitely suggest stopping here."}
{"text":"This is easily the best delivery food in Pittsburgh! It's fresh, light and the crepes are such a delightful treat!!  Do yourself a favor and get your next lunch or dinner from this perfect little cafe."}
{"text":"Delicious savory crepes and sandwiches. Nice variety compared to other downtown fast food. The Chicken and Mushrooms Crepe was very good and consisted of grilled chicken, mushrooms, onion and provolone and mozzarella cheese in bechame sauce in a nicely prepared crepe. No frills dining area but plenty of seating. Convenient location although not bustling, great for carryout and close to the point park."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this inconspicuous little café is for a while now. It's located across from the old Joseph Horne Building on Stanwix Street. They have breakfast items, crapes, salads, sandwiches, wraps, espresso drinks and more.  I'm assuming that most of the business is generated from takeout and delivery judging from the modest décor with only a few tables for dine in. There is some unassuming art on the walls, a counter for ordering and country music videos are playing on a TV on one of the walls.    I was kind of in the mood for a hoagie so I ordered the Italian sandwich. The gentleman behind the counter courteously took my order and the sandwich was in front of me in about five minutes. On a real plate; not a disposable paper plate as I would have expected. The hoagie was generously portioned with Genoa salami, ham, capicola, melted mozzarella & provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato and a light sprinkle of dressing on a slightly toasted fresh bun. Delicious, but it was more food than I could eat.   There's a lot of competition in the downtown lunch market and Gio's seems to understand this. They offer a good sandwich for a competitive price... a solid 4 stars in my book. My total came to $8.55 plus tip."}
{"text":"I'm sitting in Gio's Cafe, having just downloaded the Yelp app specifically to leave a glowing review.   After a show at the Byham Theater, my friend and I saw the neon lights of Gio's Cafe while walking back to our parking garage. The owner just happened to be unlocking the door, and invited us in, despite the fact that it was ten o'clock at night and well beyond normal business hours.   This is, quite literally, the single luckiest thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life. The chai was the best I've ever tasted, and the sandwich was prepared on the most incredible bread. Only halfway through my sandwich (and with crumbs on my face) did the owner tell that he uses only organic produce (of the finest quality, I will add for him).   If you are in the area, you need to try this place out. The only thing negative I can say is that I actually live two hours away and won't be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Here is the BEST thing I just realized about Gio's- they deliver Coffee, cappuccino, latte, mocha, chai, tea, pop, lemon aid, and other drinks using electronic apps with a minimum order of $10.  Hallelujah! It's an answer to wishes that I've had for years now! I can't believe I didn't catch on to this sooner! We've enjoyed this hidden gem for their quick sandwiches and crepes and I just found out about the coffee being able to come along!   One of the things I've always liked the most about Gio's is their Panini size. For only $8. The crispy bread filled with turkey, tomato, red pepper, & cheese reheats beautifully. I savor one half for lunch and the other for dinner of lunch the next day. Their panini's don't come with fries and I prefer it that way because they're huge. I usually don't eat fries. They tend to go home and be given to our dogs. The dogs don't complain but the vet recently called our small dog \"fat\". So the less fries the better for us all. They do offer a lunch option during the week that is a half size with fries. The half size is more than filling, however I prefer to not order that item and go for the full size that's the same price as the lunch special.  I haven't decided which panini is my favorite. It's a struggle to decide between the Turkey or the chicken.   The same with the wrap. I have trouble deciding which is my favorite and I often modify my selection swapping out mayo for ranch if it's what's offered. That's never a problem. I tend to lean towards ordering the Buffalo chicken or chicken the most. I enjoy the spinach wrap used for the chicken wrap when the mayo is substituted for ranch.   Now where Gio's really deserves 5 stars is this- their crepes. They are delicious. And you really want to try to try them. There are savory and sweet. Trying to decide which are best is impossible. Saving room to have both is almost impossible as well. I suggest going with a friend who enjoys splitting the first time. That way you can try the best of both on your first visit.   Amongst the savory you will have to decide if you're ready to go spicy or not. Their spicy options are fantastic. The red chicken has a wonderful kick to it that is beautifully rounded out by the onions & cheeses.  The Veggie Crepe with tomato and spinach is in a creamy sauce w feta. Superb.   Now the sweet crepes. Personally, I could possibly eat your left shoe if it was slathered in Nutella. And while they do have Nutella, and I do suggest ordering them, do try the other varieties. I enjoy the very basic and light classic crepe served with butter, sugar, and lemon. They are beautiful.  The choice between chocolate, Nutella, berry, strawberry, whipped cream, banana, walnut, and such is all a personal preference that will be a delight to eat once placed in the thin delicate pancake."}
