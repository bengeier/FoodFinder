{"text":"A complete turnaround since my first visit when they first opened. Everything was fresh and delicious. We had the guacamole, green and red enchiladas, and black and pinto beans (which tasted just like my moms growing up...yum!). This will definitely be in my rotation of restaurants."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Mejico and was very pleased by what we had. I had the Ahi Tuna Tacos. They had the perfect balance of spice, freshness and acidity. We would definitely go back. As for the place being pricey, you have to know what you are going for. Binks is across the street and the area is very up and coming. So I'm not surprised by the little higher price tag. Was well worth it. If you have a choice between Mejico and Taco Guild, pick Mejico. We were definitely underwhelmed by Taco Guild. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Mejico has a good happy hour. I especially enjoyed the $1 carne asada taco and easy going atmosphere. Next time I will try an entree."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite happy hour spots.  The staff is super friendly.  The skinny margaritas are amazing at $5.00.  Add on $1.00 carne street tacos.  Definitely a find for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Mejico is phenomenal and deserving of all the praise I can heap upon it.  The service was absolutely top-notch.  The margaritas aren't the overly sweet swill you're accustomed to - the quality of the ingredients in their cocktails speak for themselves.  The dinner menu contains a lot of the finer ingredients that really distinguish this from standard Mexican fare, namely cotija cheese and some of the best green chile sauce I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"This restaurant was outstanding.  The ambiance was perfect.  The food was perfect, I loved every minute of our visit.  I ordered the shrimp diablo - which in other places is usually not spicy at all and it's usually subpar at best, taste wise.  This shrimp diablo was MUCHO spicy  - I loved it!!  And it tasted fantastic.  My husband ordered chile relleno and that was excellent as well.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  And we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent and this is my first 5 star review!  Im usually a tough cookie.  The food was excellent.  Jose, our server, was attentive and pleasant.  Coming here again soon.  Every dish was outstanding."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!   Food and drinks are amazing.  Handmade margaritas only $5!  Really cute tree covered patio.  Just had a birthday gathering of 20+, and the space was perfect.   Management and staff are super friendly and were very accommodating to our every need. Could I give 6 stars? I love this place."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome $1 street tacos. The bartender was so friendly. The husband and I live nearby and decided to check it out. The queso was also really yummy."}
{"text":"It's near my shop, so I go once in a while for lunch. The shrimp and chorizo burrito is well worth stopping in for."}
{"text":"Me and my wife really enjoy this place. Great happy hour. Food is excellent. Great vibe."}
{"text":"Simple menu with fresh well planned ingredients.  Chips and salsa are amazing. Try one of the margaritas with an entree . Dining room is clean, simple and authentic.  Service has been nothing but excellent."}
{"text":"The food is the star here and the staff's attention to detail sets it off perfectly!  When we were here with a friend mid-summer, we left speculating how nice it would be to come back when we could comfortably eat on the lovely little patio. Even though they don't take reservations, we took our chances last night with a group of seven, and these people really delivered! We were all impressed by quick setup on the patio and pleasant and efficient service throughout. What a pleasure to interact with an experienced server proud to serve fresh made-to-order food that comes from the kitchen as it's ready.   Come knowing it's not the neighborhood Sonoran multi-page menu, so it's going to cost a little more. What you'll get is perfect clean margaritas, awesome guacamole, an entree selection with something for everyone ... and willingness to accommodate special requests. If you pace yourself, you might even have room to sample one of the two desserts.  We all left resolved to tell our friends not to miss this ... and check out the patio!"}
{"text":"Great food great service  Try the 66 el camino best margarita ever! Food is fresh and authentic"}
{"text":"We were welcomed before setting foot inside the door! What a wonderful brunch to experience. Family comfortable atmosphere and live music. The food is delicious and the people are kind and energetic. They have a great selection of drinks as well. We will be back soon for dinner on the patio !"}
{"text":"I had the steak which was great, my wife had the chile relleno. The relleno was also good but a little heavy on the cheese and the cheese should've been melted more.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant many times with friends and family and colleagues. I have eaten  homemade Mexican food all my life. This restaurant will not disappoint.  Freshness, flavor and mindful presentation are a cut above all other Mexican food restaurants.  The fish tacos are created with fresh seared tuna, cabbage, jalapeños and a wonderful sauce on the side.  The rice is perfectly prepared and flavorful.  So many other mexican restaurants serve rice as a color spot on the plate,  flavorless and over cooked.  The pinto beans are a delightful simple recipe which focuses on the great flavor of pinto beans.  No need to fry or over saturate with cheese,  as most restaurants prepare their pinto beans.    The posole soup is like no other inPhoenix.  There is a wonderful infusion of cilantro in the broth of the soup.   It creates a beautiful presentation of an amazing green color in a simple large white bowl. The soup is generously stocked with fresh cabbage, chicken and hominy.    The atmosphere is open and simple with local art on the walls.  In cooler times of the year the patio is beautifully planted with shade trees and containers.  Large windows in the dining room allow you to enjoy the patio all year long.  Bravo Mejico!!!  Can't wait to return!!  Arnold Lopez"}
{"text":"The food was very good. A little to pricey.  Not kid orientated. Me and my family went there for my Dads birthday and took my little girl with use thinking they would have somthing for kids and they didn't. They couldn't even try to accomidate for her. Not even make quesadilla. So we ordered some chips and salsa for her.($4.00 )and desided to share our food with her. The green chilli was really good. But the price was way to high. (18.00) also ordered carna asada plate that was really good too. (20.00) i would like to go back. But with the prices and not even trying to make somthing for kids left me with a sour taist in my mouth. So if you can afford them and don't have kids. I would say to try them out."}
{"text":"What a lovely surprise! I had the Carne Asada and my husband had a shrimp and chorizo burrito.  After our first visit we talked about their food for weeks, just couldn't get it out of our minds.  On our return visit I was worried that I might have built it up so much in my mind that the reality couldn't compare. Happily for me it did. It was even better than I remembered!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: The owners have spent a ton of money on gutting this place and making it feel authentic, charming, and comfortable. All the tables have tablecloths and candles and the lighting, artwork, whitewashed walls, and tiles make this a cozy Mexican restaurant.   Food: This was probably the best chile verde (green chile pork) dish that I have ever had. Instead of being oily like at other places, it was creamy and the pork was very tender. The carne asada was perfectly grilled. Paired with a refreshing and crisp salad and the sides of spanish rice and beans all made for nice stuffed corn tortillas. The appetizer of queso fundido was not what I expected (usually this is a large dish with melted stringy cheese), as it was a small cup of very creamy cheese sprinkle with chorizo. I guess my only suggestion would be to make the portions bigger to replace the small cups of guacamole and salsa that came with the dishes, but I am sure if you asked for more, they would provide it. Instead of huge messy plates of tons of food like you get elsewhere, here you get high quality ingredients presented in a clean and meticulous format. I definitely didn't leave hungry.  Service: The 2 gentlemen working were very forthcoming and welcoming. Our server, who came from their Chandler location, was obviously very knowledgeable of the food and was very efficient and friendly. The bartender was nice enough to get us to try new drinks, which were amazing and I would never have thought to order them without him doing this. We also met the chef/owner who is a great guy who loves simple, high quality food from family recipes.  The bar area looks like a quaint fun place to hang out during happy hour and it looks like they will have a patio soon. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food and service was great. The Carne Asada was the best that I have had in Phoenix. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I had read about Mejico on the Chow Bella blog. I decided to give it a try. The menu is fairly small, but the overall the selection was good. There were four of us. We started with Shrimp Ceviche and Chips & Salsa. Both were very good. The Ceviche had just the right amount of citrus bite to it. The salsa had a good amount of heat without being overpowering.   For dinner we had:  Chili Verde Enchiladas de Rez Backyard Carne Asada Relleno de Pollo  All very well done. I did think that the black beans were pretty limited on flavor. They bordered on the bland side.   In the end, the food was good. It was the prices that really limit my review here. With tip our bill was ~$125. Just seems expensive for 2 appetizers and 4 entrees. No drinks - just water.  N*joy..."}
{"text":"We don't find ourselves in the likes of Central Phoenix very often, so when we ended up in the area around dinner time, the obvious question was where we should eat that we've been thinking about trying.  Mejico was fresh on the brain after a recent recommendation so off we went!    Outside is unassuming, with a small (kinda awkward) parking lot and great view of a pawn shop.  Inside looks like another world.. it's classy, subtly Mexican-inspired and intimate.  We were greeted with a friendly welcome and asked to seat ourselves wherever we were comfortable.  Unfortunately, we had just missed happy hour (ends at 6!) which was a bummer, because there look like there are good deals then.  The dinner menu is a little pricier than I'm used to for Mexican food, but it was also high quality.  The chips and salsa for the table were surprisingly good.  After reading that Jennifer O found the salsa too mild, I took a big bite.  Well people, it is not mild.  I may be a spice-wimp, but it had some kick.  Smaller bites from there on out.  The chips were fresh, salty and thicker than usual.  I'm accustomed to complimentary chips and salsa before the entrees, but I'm glad we tried this appetizer anyway.    A split order of the enchiladas (the server recommended one chicken, one beef, rather than being faced with the decision between the two) sufficed for two people.  The pinto beans were a lot more flavorful than the black, which is another choice offered.    Service was attentive, and our waiter showed us the happy hour and lunch menus so we could get a feel for them.  The prices were almost half, and some of the menu items looked really good.  I'd love to return for lunch some time, or for happy hour to try one of their house-made (actually made in house, from fresh ingredients each time) margaritas.  Until then!"}
{"text":"loved the chips and $8 (ouch) guacamole was good.  had shrimp enchiladas, terrific.  Drink was a little less than satisfying but the atmosphere and staff were top notch.  Really enjoyed it.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, and they never disappoint.  The best Mexican food in Phoenix bar none!!!  You will not be disappointed!  Jerry, the bartender, makes the best margaritas!!!  Amazing staff, great ambiance, great Location.  Do yourself a favor and stop in for an outstanding experience!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on the way to the airport so I did not eat much. But what I did eat was good and the service was excellent. Really nice clean place that is set up very well. Hopefully I will get back here and try a full meal."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Sucks it's summer because their outside patio is adorable. Ordered cheese enchiladas with verde sauce and they were some of the best I've had...according to my taste buds. The rice and beans were super good too, which is rare. Guac is good, nothing too special to be honest...hopefully they work on that. My honey had the fish tacos which were delicious as well! Drinks were yummy and big, so totally worth the price. I think this spot is a gem if your looking for great, not greasy, Mexican food."}
{"text":"Spicy homemade modern Mexican food with really amazing sauces and salsas. The chicken enchiladas were fantastic, but if you want sweet and very spicy try the diablo shrimp."}
{"text":"I put off this review until they could get the kinks worked out...and thankfully, they have!    The first time we went it was right after they opened.  We weren't expecting much because of that...but what we got was even worse.  I'm not going to go into details...bad food and bad/creepy service and waaaay over-priced.  Growing pains.  But the owners were awesome.  We went back again and I ordered the same thing I did the first time (ahi tacos).  Both times, sadly, the ahi was over-cooked.  We vowed never to return.  Until we did.  Third try's a charm.  We ordered something completely different...salad and soup.  Much better.  The soup came in a huge bowl and it was so fresh and tasty.  The salad was big as well and equally as yummy.  And, even better, they had lowered some of their prices.  It seemed like it was over-priced for the 'hood and now is about par with Bink's across the street.  I'm a fan...we'll be back for sure to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Family owned but does not offer family minded service.  Bartender will change the price on drinks so, be sure to review your check carefully.  Servers attitude makes you fell as if you are a bother coming there."}
{"text":"First time here and I ordered a carne asada torta from the lunch menu.. The service here was so great, but the carne asada was just a sad mess. I spit out the majority as it was full of fat and rough parts. I ended up eating the bolillo, avocado and papas for $10  Carne asada should be delicious if it's a headliner on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went to restaurant for late dinner. This is a small restaurant with outdoor seating as well. Our server Mike was very pleasant, gave us plenty of time to order our drinks and relax. He then came back for our food order. Our food was delivered warm, asked to be reheated and was returned hot. My husband ordered Chile rellano and I ordered enchiladas. Entree was accompanied by rice and beans. Food was tasty and not overpowering Presentation was excellent. I definitely would recommend trying Mejico."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere... Service was eh and food was just ok.  Ordered the enchiladas de res and were served warm but not hot and very light on the sauce which made it dry. Thought it was overpriced for the amount of food.  The Cadillac Margarita was was very good."}
{"text":"The remodel they did to the building is very nice.  It is cozy and cute inside.  The service was friendly and attentive.  My wife got a margarita and it was fantastic, fresh made from scratch.  I got the beef enchiladas and they were delicious.  My wife got the green chili and it was top notch as well.  Overall, the fare was fresher and more interesting than a typical Mexican restaurant.   We loved the food but we probably won't be going back much.  It was just too expensive for what you get.  The margarita was $13.  Our bill came to just over $70 for 2 entries and 2 drinks.  There are a lot of alternatives in the area that are significantly less.  They need a few lower priced (under $10) items on the menu.  They charged $4 for chips and salsa. it's too bad they priced the food one tier above what they deliver.  It was a great experience otherwise.  My review is one star lower as a result."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for dinner. You are paying prices for fine dining but are left without fine food. Chips and salsa are $4, which is not customary at any local Mexican restaurant. Perhaps you could get away with this if you offered a selection of salsas, bottomless, etc., but all you get is one runny salsa, which did have great flavor, at least. The atmosphere is also very nice (although not elegant, as the prices infer), and the service is friendly. The salad was completely underwhelming. The chile relleno was not crispy and may have been reheated. The quality of the food is better than fast casual, but did nothing to wow or exceed my expectations."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, friendly staff. They are at times short staffed during busy hours and you can tell the waitress/bartender are stretched thin. Only recommendations I could give would be to increase staff and bring down the cost a bit. Regardless, it's delicious food"}
{"text":"Excellent. I absolutely love Mejico. Fantastic corn tortillas  tacos . Best Rice!! Excellent tequila too!"}
{"text":"Exploring new Mexican restaurants around the neighborhood Mèjico was definitely a gem. The ambience was inviting and intimate, the drinks were perfected by their mixologist, and the food was simply delicious. I have already recommended this place to a few friends and will continue to do so. It's definitely worth a try.  Tip: Try the shrimp Relleno - the sauce is a bit spicy, but it's delicious. (And this is coming from a person that loves everything spicy.)"}
{"text":"I can't believe prices for being Mexican food...rice And beans Are one of the most un expensive products and sadly people still don't know how to prepare this."}
{"text":"The new salsa is full of flavor and spice! The carne asada tacos are yummy! I notice the portions have gotten slightly larger! This place is a GEM! Great place for happy hour starts at 3pm Mon through Friday!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food here.  We got the chips and salsa to start.  The chips were definitely made in house, and were great. The salsa was an unexpected surprise, as it really had a nice zing to it.  I've had the Caldo Azteza (tortilla soup) at El Zocalo in Chandler (same family), so I thought I would try it here.  It was just as good, and obviously the same recipe.   The Caldo was really a meal of it's own, but I also ordered the Green Chili Pork, which was phenomenal.  The pieces of pork were so tender, and the chili was really flavorful but not overly spicy.  The rice was delicious and the tortilla was perfect to pick up the pieces of pork.  The server, Cody, was really great too.  He checked in on us regularly and was very attentive.  Couldn't give it five stars, as I did find it a bit pricy, but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Enchiladas De Pollo is a fabulous dish that isTangy wonderful. Mole con Pollo is authentic tasting as it should be, Yvette you need to ask for her, great server and smile..."}
{"text":"Difficult for me to convey a concise review on this place.  This little Mexican establishment kinda feels stuck between wanting to be a neighborhood hangout and being a fine dining establishment.  The menu has a decent variety of items, and yet is somewhat simple.  The bar is well stocked, or at least feels like it is.  I had a lot of mixed feelings about the place from the time I came in all the way to my departure.  Overall I had good feelings when all was said and done, and yet something about this place felt, well, conflicted.  Located in what used to be Linda's Diner, Mejico now occupies this small space near 24th St and Osborn (just west of Mr. Submarine).  With famed chef Kevin Binkley now having one of his own restaurants in the neighborhood, it would seem the creators of Mejico decided an upscale Mexican food spot was the next step in the evolution of this neighborhood.  When you walk inside, you first pass the small bar area up front en route to the dining area.  There's a surprisingly ample amount of seating both inside and on the patio out back.  It was a super windy evening so my party and I decided to dine inside this go around.  The place was pretty quiet on a Monday so our server was super quick and attentive to our needs all evening.  We were first provided complimentary chips and guacamole.  The chips themselves were excellent actually.  Thick cut and crunchy with just the right amount of salt and the guacamole was topped with queso fresco.  A great little snack for everyone to share to start with.  I also got a Modelo Especial beer to drink.  There's 8 main entrees to choose from on the menu (plus some fish and salad options).  Pretty much everything on the menu I've had somewhere in my Mexican food adventures at least once (Rellenos, Enchiladas, Pork Chile Verde, etc.), so it took me awhile to settle on one.  One item that caught my attention this go around was the Mole de Pollo.  Mole is a super complicated dish to make no matter what version you're going for.  I've only had it twice in my life (including a very memorable version at Barrio Cafe in Phoenix), but I remember enjoying the complexity of the sauce.  So I went with that.  It came with rice and fresh hot tortillas and a small side bowl of black beans with queso fresco.  It was pretty decent.  I wouldn't say its as good as the mole I had at Barrio, but if you like a mole with a more savory emphasis on the chocolate notes, you'll like this version.  Wrapping some of the mole with rice and beans in the tortilla was a very delicious combo.  The portion wasn't too large so I had enough room for dessert afterwards.  For dessert we shared a flan.  Nothing wrong here as the flan was super creamy and the syrup and chocolate sauce was just right.  So now the Debbie Downer part.  The prices.  As Yelpers have quite accurately pointed out, this place ain't cheap.  The mole dish I got was $18.  I sort of get that mole is complicated to make so that could be somewhat understood.  But two others in my party got enchiladas for $15 that looked more like taquitos.  A third member got their Carne Asada dish.  While that dish had a decent amount of meat, I'm not sure any of us felt it was work the $20 price tag.  The flan was $6 which was probably fair.  All in all, the food is here is quite good (very good in certain spots).  The atmosphere, the aesthetics, and the staff are also excellent.  The prices as they relate to the portions and quality?  That's questionable.  A chef as famous as Kevin Binkley can probably walk into this neighborhood and charge whatever he wants, but I'm not sure an unknown upstart could take such liberties.  If you're coming here during happy hour when the prices are cheaper, you'll be fine.  But otherwise most probably wouldn't be able to afford dining here regularly as it stands right now.  That said, I think owner Obed De La Cruz has a place with a lot of potential here.  If they can get the price point figured out, they'll have a winner.  After all, good food is something we want to be able to have regularly, not just for special occasions."}
{"text":"Margaritas were great! We brought my family from Canada here to try some Mexican food. I read a lot of the reviews before we decided on this place!! Salsa was spicy but very good!! The staff was so funny and took great care of us. I was sad I didn't do double rice because it was so good! Tacos are great! Go for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"iJOLE!!!!! Mejico is AMAZING! This rating spills well over 5 stars. Try 6, 7 or 8 stars! The food here is authentic top quality Mexican cuisine. My partner and I ordered the Margarita (best in town), camarones diablas, the posole verde and sopapillas for dessert. Food presentation was beautiful and incredibly flavorful and all around DELICIOUS! Service was quick and friendly. Gotta give it up to our server Jose and the master behind the margarita, Jerry. The ambiance here is extremely charming- a small venue with a nice warm hospitable feel. Cute patio, clean bathrooms.... so, pretty much perfectO!!"}
{"text":"We had a really good meal here. I had the Shrimp Rellenos and my husband had the chicken enchiladas. Both were very good. The actual restaurant was really quaint and inviting. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was for two reasons. First,  the guacamole appetizer was tiny....I mean really small. It could easily be fixed by upsizing to a small bowl. Second, the prices were a tad high. I would pay $13-$17 for items...but pushing $23 is a bit high.  The saving grace on price would be happy hour...$1 street tacos and $3 cheese quesadillas are a steal.  Overall, great food..but pricey."}
{"text":"The owners of El Zocalo in Chandler have ventured out of the suburbs to open up Mejico, a mid-priced Mexican restaurant located in the old Linda's on Osborn location (Osborn at 24th Street). Regarding the interior, it's night and day from what it used to be. Owner Abed designed it, and it's gorgeous. They built a stunning bar that features more bottles of tequila than any ASU student could hope to contend with on any given Saturday night. Co-owner (and Abed's wife) Pam was there to introduce herself alongside Jason, the bartender. Both were extremely nice and welcoming.  Pam said that I was their first takeout order ever, and for that she threw in some free (homemade) chips and fresh guacamole and a slice of flan. The chips and guac almost ruined my dinner, because I polished off the whole thing before getting started on my main course. I ordered the Enchiladas De Camaron ($16), which is grilled shrimp enchiladas served with green tomatillo sauce, and rice and beans served on the side. They don't skimp on the shrimp at Mejico -- each enchilada was packed with four or five huge, succulent, and tender shrimp. The tomatillo sauce was light and fresh -- it let the shrimp be the star of the dish. The rice was some of the lightest rice I have had from a Mexican restaurant. It complimented my meal perfectly. You get your choice of black beans or pinto beans -- I chose the latter and am glad I did. A little smoky, the beans were fantastic. I'd go back just for a side of pinto beans.  All in all, a fantastic experience from start to finish. Next time, I'll eat there. It's the perfect place to take a date for an intimate meal, and if the rest of the menu is anything like the Enchiladas de Camaron, I'll probably become a regular.  Note: They don't have a website yet, but the owners stated that it would be up and running soon."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food, the vibe, the service and the location. I went with a party of six and every single person had an excellent experience. There were smiles all around, and full happy bellies.   The flan is the best flan I have ever had.    The only thing I can say is that it's a bit pricey for what it is, that brings it down one star."}
{"text":"We live in the area and have an easy walk to Mejico. I wanted to follow an earlier reviewer's advice about a great happy hour (Christine) but unfortunately we were extremely disappointed. We arrived on a Friday afternoon about 4 PM, on a night when Bink's across the street was closed for a private party. Mejico looked nice, we liked the vibe. But man, this is not a Happy Hour. This is a Sad Hour. What's so special about really, really miniature street tacos or a $3 cheese quesadilla that is so small it is literally only three small bites? Happy Hour is, for us, a time to experience a new place -- to get a feel for the ambiance, the menu items and so forth. For example, go to Happy Hour at Beckett's Table and you get a feel for their menu and their flavors. At Mejico, they take a tiny 6\" flour tortilla, put a tiny amount of cheese in it and roll it over. It was a ripoff, and I don't say that lightly because anything you get for $3 has got to be small (so assume this is REALLY small). The special happy hour margarita was just a much smaller version of their real margarita, and so forth. Basically, we'll never go back and the owner lost out on the opportunity to get a new set of regulars. All you have to do is treat happy hour as if it is special -- and give a warm welcome. In this case, the smell of pot wafting into the front of the house from the kitchen and the glazed look on the two waiters faces was a bit much. When one of them asked how we enjoyed the food and we told them what a bad value it was, he simply smiled and walked away. This place is s short-timer, and thats a shame because mid-town is a potentially cool area and the owner spent some money on the inside."}
{"text":"What a great place to enjoy some upscale Mexican food on the patio!  We stopped in when my mother-in-law was in town and arrived right when it opened to be seated immediately on the patio.  The place is really cute, the service was good and the food was fantastic.  I highly recommend the enchiladas - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great spot. After coming here for the first time I think we have now been coming back at least once a week. Great tequila selection and customer service oriented staff. Oh and the food is pretty delicious!"}
{"text":"Mejico is not your typical Mexican spot, it's amazing! Week after week and not one meal lets me down. Very high quality ingredients and always so tasty. I'm so spoiled by Mejico that I will not go to another Mexican restaurant. The staff is fantastic, friendly and pay attention to detail. I would rate it 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I love this place. The Mexican rice is the best I've ever had. The Ahi tacos are my favorite item. All the ingredients are very fresh, and the flavors are perfectly balanced. The margaritas are a little pricey, but they are hand made not crappy sour mix that's been laying around all day. The margaritas are $5 at happy hour so go at that time if you want to save a couple bucks. The carne asada is very tender. It's not dry or rubbery at all. Try this place. You will be glad you did. The tortillas are the bomb and guac is awesome too."}
{"text":"It was a Friday Evening, during monsoon season; and we decided to stop by this quaint little restaurant just West of 24th Street on Osborn.  It was cloudy and windy, and rain was threatening, The rapid change in weather just made for a wonderfully cool atmosphere to hang out with my Beloved. The vine draped windows, the hard wood flooring, and the candle lit cozy tables gave it an old world fairy-tale like atmosphere.  We were so enamored with this place's ambiance that we contacted one of our daughters, who enthusiastically decided to join us for dinner.   After all, it was a free dinner while hanging out with Mom and Dad!  The menu was not extensive, but what they did have; they executed quite well.  I had the Ceviche. And the presentation and flavor of the shrimp was quite appetizing.  My beloved wife and daughter had the Enchilada and the Relleno, respectively.   Both were quite delectable, and had a neutral taste to it. Not too bland, and not too spicy. Just perfect for their palates.  For good measure, we ordered Flan and Sopapillas. The honey on the Sopapillas were just oh so sweet. The Flan was a little on the tart side, but good enough to be enjoyed.  As we enjoyed our meals, the rain began to pour and made for a wonderful backdrop to this delightful meal, along with the very special company that we are so very blessed to have!"}
{"text":"Just moved in down the road and was exploring the nearby restaurants. Stopped by Mejico for a quick lunch and was really glad I did. This will be my new go to spot. Had the Avocado Torta. Flavors melded together perfectly with just the right amount of spice from the jalapeño.  The fresh made thick cut fries were excellent as well with the sweet mustard dipping sauce. Excited to go back again."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little surprise this place was. Quaint and intimate. Lights shining bright on the front and outside patio but nicely dimmed inside with tea lights on your table. Wonderful, friendly service. And the food.... delicious. Beautifully presented dishes with flavor to match. We tried the Ceviche and Carne Asada plate. You cannot go wrong with either (be forewarned, the Ceviche was spicy but very appetizing). Will be a favorite for those special nights out."}
{"text":"It was really tough to make a reservation at this place because they don't answer the phones and don't offer any kind of online reservation system outside of messaging them on yelp (they replied several days later).    Additionally,I know that sometimes things go wrong and you have to close.  However, I drove 45 min to this  business after making a reservation through yelp to find out they had closed the day prior due to a mechanical problem and wouldn't reopen for a almost a week. A message or phone call for your existing  reservations would of gone a long way.  Maybe my expectations are too high? Certainly not trying to crush a business for this as it's probably a bad week anyway, but not sure I'll make it to Mejico anytime soon as they're going to the bottom of my PHX list.  Update 4/2017 Follow up.  Owner contacted me in 12/2016 and said they'd email me a card to make up for issues.  I provided info and was never contacted.  Checked junk folder and inquired with restaurant- no response. Kind of weird, but three other people private messaged me to not go this place.  Sorry, too many other legit small businesses work too hard to give up you more than one star.    Remembered all this when I happened to be driving through that area.  I've never been able to actually eat here so I can't speak to the actual food.  Never received anything from the owner"}
{"text":"Ok this place has gone down hill for sure. Was a regular and last 2 times I went, food was bad and found hair in my food both times. Drinks are pricey and staff that are there are rude.  The waitress literally said to \"go f***\" yourself.\" Today we went in with our therapy dog and was told we couldn't have her outside even though I had proof that the dog was a therapy dog. One female staff (won't name) broke the law and asked for the \"paperwork\" and was rude to us in front of another customer. This place isn't worth the prices, not worth the rude staff and nor is worth the ignorance.  Note Jose has always been kind, but the female waitress needs to get a job that doesn't involve customer service as she spoke to the wrong person that can spread the word fast about how not to go to a place like this. Don't stop here there is a reason they aren't busy anymore and have to attract customers with a sign on the road that says \"now open\" Hmmmmmm....haven't you been open for awhile? Friends, pass this place up...pass the corner to ASI ES LA VIDA on 24th St between Osborn and Indian School if you want great food, nice people and consistency that's worth your $$$."}
{"text":"Lunch was mahi mahi tacos with creamy pinto beans.  There was just enough spice and onion in the taco but didn't hide the fish.  the taco was topped with avocado and cilantro.  I'll have to come back for the happy hour (3-6 pm). Upscale Mexican vibe with a cool factor."}
{"text":"Great HH place! Chris the bartender/waiter welcomed us into this interesting lil nook that's nestled in the southern part of the biltmore/arcadia district. Unfortunately there are no beers on tap, only bottles, BUT...there is a plethora of awesome Mexican beers available for $3 during HH (3-6pm, M-F). There's also a variety of food choices on the HH menu. We absolutely loooooved the ceviche tostadas!! We'll mos def be back for HH and possibly for dinner or lunch one day soon."}
{"text":"A solid place that I'd be inclined to give another star to if it wasn't for the fact that Asi Es La Vida is right around the corner and offers a similar menu, better ambiance, and cheaper prices.  Still some very good mole."}
{"text":"I wish there was a 6th star....  Went here for lunch with some buddies on a Thursday afternoon and was bummed that the Shrimp and chili Relleno was only on the dinner menu. The bartender heard me talking about how amazing it was and volunteered the have the cooks whip it up special!   ABSOLUTELY my favorite local Mexican dish and restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is delicious! Service is great! I can't believe this placed has been open for a year and I am just discovering it! I work downtown and they can me in out for my hour lunch break. The Carne Asada Tacos are my favorite!!"}
{"text":"It was my woman and I first time coming here and we were impressed by this place, and mean by that is, the waitress was real friendly and on point with her recommendation, but most important the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Nice Mexican restaurant, fresh and new.  Dinners run on the upper end of the price scale, $16 to $20 something per plate, chips and salsa not included or if they are, we were not offered any.  Wait staff were friendly and everything looked clean.  I tried the shrimp enchiladas ($16) they came with rice and you choice of pinto or black beans; they were full of large shrimp and seasoned perfectly.  Mejico is a nice addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place out as it looks really bz at happy hour. My friend was taking me to phx and we decided to grab a quick early dinner on the way. We were the first people seated as they opened at 5 as it was a Saturday.  They serve  lunch and happy hour during the week. They just did a nice renovation and I hear they added some windows and changed the seating in the dining room. It's a nice bright room I. The late afternoon and facing east is not at all hot. Our server Logan was a nice guy. I got the impression that he was a relatively new server. Not because he wasn't great, because he was, it was that he still had that \"I actually care and am listening to you, and I am into the food we serve here\" phase of most newish floor staff life. Hopefully he is able to hang onto that and not drift into fake-nice-busy-robot that many servers end up. I doubt he will. Likely he will be a graphic designer or chiropractor or maybe rock star.  We had chips and salsa which was really good as both are made in house and are unique and flavorful without being too spicy or too salty, a path oft taken in salsas. Their salsa is neither red nor green but both together in that it pleased both the red and green salsa parts of my salsa palate. Bravo! My pal had chicken enchiladas which looked great: smothered in white cheese with a nice sauce served with tasty fluffy seasoned rice and some great looking pinto beans which were served in a small bowl on the side: a nice touch that keeps the plate clean and pretty. He loved every bite! I opted for fish tacos of the day which were talapia. Also very fresh and tasty served with cabbage, fresh lime, cilantro and avocado, and I had the same great rice but opted for the black beans which were perfect and topped lightly with Mexican cheese also on the side in a bowl Yum! I gobbled my food it was that good.  The beers we had were served with chilled glasses, another nice touch. I couldn't help but notice that an older lady came in solo and sat next to our table. She was a little confused at the Spanish titles on the dishes but Logan very patiently explained everything to her and ended up deducing that what she really wanted was a beef taco salad, which isn't on the menu. However between Logan and the obviously expert chef, they produced a perfect crispy taco bowl filled with tasty salad with beef. I love it when establishments find a way to say yes and make something happen rather than just say sorry just what you see on the menu. When the place is slammed I could see that not happening, but kudos to Mejico staff for bringing customer service to that next level of awesome! She dug right in and was happily munching when we left. They recently added a lovely patio and once the temp drops back to double digits, I don't doubt they will do a brisk business out there. They have amazing 3-6pm m-f happy hour specials with cheap drinks and tasty priced appies so check that out too.  I will definitely make this one of my go to places as it is quite near my place and I know my wife will love it as we like Mexican food and love having it at an actual restaurant. I will be back with her pronto! Ps: When you leave go back out the driveway you came in on as the pass through on the east side is now the new patio."}
{"text":"Happy hour $1 tacos you can't beat that!  And omgawd get the flan it is the best I have tasted here in Arizona! !!! Soooo good"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, not busy. Ordered the guacamole to start, it is essentially a half an avocado with a raw onion and tomato, topped with cilantro. It was $8 and a very small portion, pretty bland, not blended. My husband had the beef enchiladas, they were dry and bland. Our guest had the shrimp enchiladas and described them as \"no big deal.\" I had the carne asada, it had good flavor, but no better or more special than other carne asada dishes I have had elsewhere. The meals all came with rice which was flat. The pinto beans were the highlight of the meal. The margaritas were good. Service was fine, nothing in particular that stood out. Overall, I think this place is over priced for the small portions and the food is bland. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Inventive, delicious food. Not your run of the mill Mexican Cantinas. Beautiful garden patio. I ordered green chile tostada . Delicious! Not too spicy for me, perfectly flavored. Go out of your way to find this nearly hidden gem. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place has the bomb Mexican food. If you're looking for authentic flavors and great customer service I recommend this place."}
{"text":"We came her last week and were very impressed.  This place is in our neighborhood so we felt we had to finally try Mejico.  The atmosphere is top notch. Very clean and has an awesome authentic Mexican décor.  The place isn't huge but the patio outside is one of the nicest we've ever been to.  The staff was excellent.  Very friendly courteous service.  They food was delicious.  I had the red chili enchiladas with rice and pinto beans and it was all very good.  My wife had the green chili shrimp relleno.  We had the Queso Fundido appetizer and that was also really good.  Hope Mejico is here to stay!!"}
{"text":"I'd driven past Mejico several times while weaving through neighborhoods to avoid traffic, and I always admired the quaint mid-century space covered in foliage. My girlfriend and I finally decided to check it out after reading some good reviews, and we are so glad we did. While Arizona is riddled with \"Authentic\" Mexican food, there's only a handful of restaurants that have the food to prove it; Mejico is near the peak of that handful. The Relleno de Pollo had tons of flavor and was soft and melty, unlike imposter's tough and gamey peppers. Also, I thought I didn't like flan. Turns out that I just haven't had the real stuff.   The atmosphere is very cozy with its many windows and plants. It's exactly what you'd expect from the well-groomed neighborhood secret-spot that Mejico is."}
{"text":"Excllent food.  Plus really good service. Totally chill atmosphere am with nice laid back music.  Will be eating here again soon.  Definitely a nice little spot in Phoenix"}
{"text":"One would think that it's easy to find quality Mexican food in Arizona, and while there are plenty of Mexican restaurants in the Valley, there aren't many that boast quality food, service and atmosphere.  Mejico Coina Mejicana is one of them that does all of the above...  I've been twice so far and been super pleased both times.  I went on a date one time and on a double date the next time, so I tried a few dishes as we shared on both occasions.  Chris was our waiter the first time and Katie the next.  Both recommended the Shrimp Relleno.  It is awesome.  Don't miss it!  The cocktails are good, the cervezas are cold, and the chips and guac / salsa don't disappoint either.  Atmosphere is casual with just enough Mexican flair... there is seating at the bar, in the restaurant, and on the outdoor patio as well.  Si esta buscando comida mejicana, este es el lugar.  Salud!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Carne asada is very authentic. The service is superb and the guacamole is always excellent.  It is a bit on the pricy side but they have fantastic selections for happy hour which makes it a great choice for Mexican food.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! We were headed to Binks but it was packed so we walked across the street to Mejico. Had the chili verde and my hubby had the carne asada. Very delish. I won't lie the salsa is hot but I love it like that. Yum!! We will back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to venture out and try a New Mexican restaurant and so we decided to visit during happy hour. Unfortunately, the restaurant was empty but the restaurant seem welcoming and the waitress was nice.   I wish they had more food happy hour items. We decided to stick with the hh menu because I wanted to be cheap - that's why I came during happy hour (duh). We ordered one iced tea,  7 Carne Asada street tacos and Queso Fundido. Surprisingly, they were good! The Queso was my favorite and a tad spicy. Our waitress continued to give us chips when she noticed we were low.   After we were done eating, I wanted to try the sopapilla, which is not a hh item but hey - it was so good!   The total of our bill was $21.89 plus tip. Overall, I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the tostada with carne asada instead of chile verde. It was good! The meat was tender and full of flavor...it was layered with black beans, meat and had lettuce, red onions and tomato on top, it also came with a side of chipotle cream sauce. I would have liked some avocado and maybe Mexican cream but I think I'll ask next time. My friends ordered the tacos and a torta, there weren't any complaints and we all finished every bite! The waiter was very friendly he even asked if we wanted waters for the road since it was extremely hot! Such a nice touch. Overall I was happy, it can be a bit pricey (the tostada didn't come with any sides) but for the quality I think it's worth it. I am going to check them out on a night out or weekend, the margaritas looked amazing and I heard him say everything was fresh."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday with my girlfriend and parents. The happy hour was great and the drinks were tasty. The service was quick and friendly. They throw in a flan for my bday which was very nice of them."}
{"text":"I must say, we didn't really expect much going into this little restaurant. It was an early Saturday night and aside from one full table and a few people at the bar, no one else was dining there.    Mejico is in an area that's primarily residential and features a nice backyard patio area that's fenced in. Service was good and prices were reasonable for the amount of food that we received.  I don't like fish, so I opted for a carne asada and pollo taco combination with rice and beans. They were out of refried beans, so I decided on some pinto beans as an alternative. The rice, in particular, was excellent. The tacos had a good amount of flavor to them. My girlfriend ordered the enchiladas de pollo, which also had great flavor. I've also had their enchilladas de res, which did not disappoint.    Offering up the big \"Medio Litro\" Mexican cokes, some good quality chips and salsa, as well as some flan desert that actually impressed someone who isn't really a flan fan, and you really don't have much to complain about. The only exception would be the pinto beans. The first time, we received a cup of beans, while the second time, it felt more along the lines of eating bean soup.  We'll return to sample some of their other menu offerings very soon before giving it a full five star bump. But I definitely recommend paying them a visit!"}
{"text":"heard of this place from a friend of mine and he was all praises. We decided to try it and he did not steer us wrong. The food was wonder ful! There were five of us so we were able to try a variety of dishes. There was not a bad one in the bunch. From the chips and fresh salsa to the chicken enchiladas, carne asada, green chile verde etc. Forgot to mention the margaritas, Great! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I went Thursday around noon to celebrate a birthday lunch with a group of 7 other coworkers and we all thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  The service was excellent and everybody really enjoyed their food. Typically, I shy away from Mexican restaurants because I am a self-proclaimed Mexican top-chef and I can cook better Mexican food than most restaurants. This is not one of those places.  I called ahead of time to let the restaurant know we would have a large party and we arrived to a table arrangement with salsa and totopos already set up. The salsa was very tasty and the chips are definitely made in-house. I ordered the carne asada torta which comes with a side of fries or \"papitas\" and I'm pretty sure I cleared my plate.  The ambiance has very authentic Mexican hacienda charm! Definitely a hidden gem in central Phoenix. I didn't order an alcoholic beverage, but based on what I can see in the bar, they are stocked with quality tequila. I'm also a self-proclaimed tequila snob, so I was pleased to see the variety. Now I need to experience their Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was unexpectedly good! I had the shrimp torta; it was really tasty. Our waiter was attentive and kind. The salsa was unique and had a great taste. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Loved our dinner at Mejico! We had exceptional service from Cody and the food and drinks were delicious. Another review mentioned the quality ingredients behind their drinks - that's spot-on! No pre mixes here. Fresh lime juice and fine tequila make them a lovely accompaniment to your meal. I had the Ahi Tuna tacos - delicious! Thick chunks of Ahi tuna with fresh avocado and red onion. Quality ingredients to be sure. Can you get heartier plates elsewhere? I'm sure you can but for atmosphere, service and quality food/drinks - Mejico is hard to beat and that's saying something in an ocean of Mexican food possibilities."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. We really enjoyed ourselves. The moment we walked in we were greeted. The service by Jared was top - notch. The food was delicious as was the atmosphere. A charming restaurant."}
{"text":"The carne asada torta is great! Amazing sauce and good flavor!  I came in right before the rush and sat at the bar. The customer service was nice and got everything I needed. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking to eat at a upscale Mexican restaurant. The only complaint is that it's a lil pricey and no lunch specials. Other than that everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The atmosphere is quaint and  cute. The Margs are amazing. A little pricey but worth it. Delicious. The Food was good. The meat was perfect, and the red sauce was flavorful and had a small hint of heat. The salsa was perfection. I would recommend this place for date night or small group gatherings."}
{"text":"This place has the best happy hour. $1 street tacos, $5 skinny margaritas, and $2 chips and salsa. Also, during regular hours the margaritas are all fresh squeezed lime juice, great tequila, and fresh ingredients. The owner Obed takes great pride in his new place. I'm excited to have a new place within walking distance to our our house."}
{"text":"Delicioso! Awesome experience from the time we walked in the door until we left.  We were immediately greeted and escorted to a table. Drinks, appetizers were beyond amazing!  Guac and margaritas is what we had. I had the carne asada and the husband had the pollo relleno. Dessert was sopapilla!  Mike D. was our waiter and treated us like royalty!  It's a small place but great ambiance.  I really liked the intimate vibe.  The music playing was great too! Highly recommend and will come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome find.  Great ambieance.  Quick lunch.  YUMMY avacado torta.  Must have been 3 whole avacados!!   Nicest manager.  I will be back for dinner.  Run. Don't walk to Mejico (cafe)."}
{"text":"Havnt been here yet but in spite of the reviews and pics,  I will be visiting this place soon with some friends and update my review. Stay tuned! =)"}
{"text":"Oh No looks like they are no longer open for Lunch!  What a shame..   So sad.."}
{"text":"When Mejico opened I was very happy to have another nice restaurant in the area.  My friend and I were able to finally get in a try the food.  We went on a week night so it was not very busy.  There were two other tables that had people eating.  We sat right down and looked at the menus.  It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to actually get to us which is a long time considering it was not busy.  We placed our order and got our food in a reasonable time.  The food was really underwhelming.  The flavor was just ok.  The price was terribly high for the amount of food and the taste.  There was nothing that made this food stand apart from anywhere else.  I got the enchiladas and they were around $15.  I could have gotten the exact same meal at about 10 other places in the area for about $7. I asked for sour cream because the food wasn't very flavorful.  They didn't have any???? The waiter brought out some kind of salad dressing?  Not quite sure what it was.  As for the service, our waiter was friendly but really did not take very good care of us.  We waited for everything.  Water, service...everything. All the while we could here him talking up a storm around the corner from the bar.  Our entire experience was just not good.  It is a real shame because it is very cute on the inside and inviting. I was really hoping for much more.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Wow, we arrived after a two day road trip to Phoenix only to find this little gem right around the corner! Happy hour is M-F from 4-6 and is well worth it! The margaritas are really what sold me on this place. Super simple, lime juice, tequila, agave nectar, salt. We shared some of the small plates from the happy hour specials and everything was delicious. The queso fundido definitely had a kick to it which was great. The bartender, Chris, was super friendly and very attentive. All around good place, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"As always. Food was amazing. Our server was super friendly and attentive. The food is incredibly fresh. Brought four folks from out of town with me and everyone loved it!  A must go place"}
{"text":"To quote my husband, \"Best. Shrimp Enchiladas. Ever.\"    The food was amazing, but best of all was the service.  Pam really knows how to do it right.  Everyone was really great and went over the top to make sure we had a fantastic experience.  The atmosphere is romantic and cozy, but there was still enough room for them to serve a table of 12 without batting an eye.    Thank you to everyone at Mejico that made our experience so terrific, would recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing, when Mejico is on, they do a very good job with their food. I've had multiple experiences now where we have shown up and they have run out of particular menu items. Their food is good, but nothing that I haven't had elsewhere. Happy hour isn't that bad, but again they've run out of happy hour items before, and we got there close to the start.  If they were busy, I'd imagine this would be a good thing.  Since they are not usually busy, a friend in the food industry says this doesn't bode well for a restaurant, since it may mean they are unable to buy their ingredients.  I want to love Mejico, it is in my neighborhood, and it gives me an option beyond Binks. Reduce your price point, or increase the portions for some of your items, and you might draw more people in. This is Phoenix, and good Mexican food is everywhere, so if you're going to charge a lot of money for Mexican dishes they should be excellent (and available)..."}
{"text":"This is a little gem of a Mexican restaurant, have been there a few times, and it has always been great. Nice service, with friendly servers. Great food, and drinks. We liked it better than the restaurant across the street."}
{"text":"All in all not a bad place for lunch. The food was good but not excellent in my opinion. I had the Chile Verde burrito and although it was good I think the cilantro and onions overpowered the flavor of the the green chile."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great Margaritas, most places don't know how to make them.  They have an awesome happy hour from 3-6.  The food was great.  My wife got the shrimp rilleno and it was awesome.  I got the carne asada steak.  I liked the beans and rice as well. The flavor is more true to authentic Mexican food.  Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"If you enjoy Macayos, Manuels and all of the other typical generic Mexican restaurants that slather their plates with sloppy beans, rice and taco/enchilada then Mejico is not the place for you.  Obed, Pam and crew are aiming for something a little more upscale than combination B - and they are successful.  The margaritas are fresh and delicious.    I love their guacamole  Their shrimp ceviche (Mexican shrimp cocktail)is the best I have ever had in a restaurant in Arizona.  The Chili Verde is delicious!  They have recently added a happy hour MONDAY - FRIDAY from 3 - 6pm with reduced drinks and food and there is an outside patio planned.  Stop by, relax and enjoy a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is great! First timers, had the shrimp relleno and it was delicious! The only complaint I have is that they charge for chips and salsa which are cheap. Other than that it was fabulous! Mejico ---- suck it up for chips and salsa. Try it!!"}
{"text":"Holy crap. The carne Asada taco was perfect. The meat was the star. It was cooked perfectly. I also had the Mahi-Mahi tacos. Another great choice. Fish was light and the sauce they put on it was a perfect compliment. Not too strong- just right.   Service was fast and friendly. Great spot for lunch."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the margaritas , so much that I ordered two. The food was spicy, delicious and hot. Yes, I would recommend this restaurant to everyone, but it is so good I would want to keep it a secret."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC. The relleno was hands down the best I've ever had in my life, as well as the  rice. The patio here is gorgeous. Inside is nice also. Great ambiance and the staff is amazing. And the owner walked up and introduced himself. Awesome guy. Do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time during happy hour last week. Great prices, great quality, small plates, $1 tacos, friendly staff, great smaller neighborhood joint!"}
{"text":"Second time in, and will go back. Make sure you have plenty of time to check this little spot out. Great drinks and fresh, fresh home made modern food. Enjoy! Cadillac Margarita and shrimp, amazing! They make queso in house with chorizo. Was not my style--"}
{"text":"Delicious place ! Must try!! So cute and great service. We had the carne asada and the ceviche. Must start with the homemade chips and salsa, it was worth paying for. Flan was amazing! Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Stellar margaritas. I had the carne asana steak tacos and they were delicious."}
{"text":"Tonight I had the carne Asada plate and the food is delicious. I have no problem with the service and the food. However I do feel that you can get exact quality elsewhere for much less. The food is quite pricy considering what is served. All in all great experience but again overpriced."}
{"text":"I planned on eating here one night while on a business trip but when I was charged $6 for a bottle of Dos XX, I bailed. I can see paying this for a good draft beer but a bottle of Dos XX? I got the impression that the place just too pricy after paying for the beer and looking at the menu. I ended up walking down the street and had a good meal somewhere else for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Visited with my brother for happy hour and sat outside on the patio.  Easy parking, great space and the happy hour prices were good.  Food was delicious!!  The quesadillas, guacamole and queso were all fantastic.  Our super nice and funny server Juanathan recommended the sopapillas for dessert and they were sooo good.  Great meal and hope to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"The wife and I had the pleasure to dine in at Mejico this evening and we absolutely love it. Even thought there were a few little hick-ups with our order the staff did everything to make us feel at home. We loved the food, from the chips and salsa (very unique) to the main course (the Diabla Shrimps and Rellno Cheese)  plus the desert (Flan). I almost forgot to mention the awesome Margaritas Mejico serves...yum :) This is a diamond in the rough, so make sure you visit before the place gets packed. I recommend this place highly and looking forward to our next visit. Thank you Logan for your friendly service."}
{"text":"recently moved to AZ from portales NM  a buddy suggested i download yelp   mejico hit the spot it wasn't the NM food i am use to but was better than anything i have had since i moved here"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. This place is a hidden gem. Great decor and patio. Has a full bar. Had the Carne Asada Tacos they were delicious. My mom had the shrimp tacos and there were tons of shrimp. Both meals came with rice and beans and price was around 10-11 bucks.  I had  gone when they first opened and service wasn't that great. Now service is excellent they are even adding new menu items and specials soon. I highly recommend. Place has great ambiance at night also."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to having a new neighborhood go-to but overall left underwhelmed. There is so much potential in this place which the restaurant does not (yet) live up to. I recently dined with my family; we started off with drinks, two orders of guac and an order of street tacos. Not sure if there was any EtOH in my margarita and the pour of my mom's wine glass was rather insulting; they did accommodate and pour her a bigger glass when asked. The food is okay, nothing to write home about. I had the chicken mole which had a strong peanut butter flavor I wasn't expecting; the rice and beans to accompany your entree are rather bland. Mejico, you're over-priced for the food and for the neighborhood. $22 for a relleno with no more than a few shrimp, beans and rice? Knock a few dollars off your entrees and you'll draw a bigger crowd."}
{"text":"The wife and I were looking for a new place to eat one night and this place was close by...we're both happy it was. The service was great (thanks Mike D) and the food excellent. While I will fully admit it was a bit on the pricy side (I spent slightly over $100 with tip) I would/will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The husband and I had a late lunch here today and it was surprisingly lovely. I was a little nervous going in because the place was just about empty. Despite this, the food was clearly fresh and tasted good. I had the carne asada torta (10$) on the the waiter/bartender's recommendation and it was very tasty. The bun was soft, the meat was tender, and it had a charred jalapeno on it (which really made the sandwich). It came with papitos (fries) which were fairly standard. The husband had carne asada tacos (9$) which came with rice and beans. He really liked the beans (I thought it was just ok, but I'm not a big bean person). My one critique is that their chips and salsa costs 4$ and the salsa isn't very spicy at all.... I would hope that for 4$ you might get at least a couple varieties of salsa. Regardless, the food was good, the service was attentive, and the prices were maybe just slightly on the high side (I did see their dinner menu which is significantly more expensive, but seems to be more on the 'fancy' side). I would like to come back here for happy hour, you can't really beat 1$ tacos and half priced apps (like the cheese dip which sounded yummy)."}
{"text":"Queso is sooooo tasty, along with the house made chips. I also had the Pollo Relleno and it was just like my abuelas! All together it was an amazing experience and would definitely make another visit. Great service, great food and great times!"}
{"text":"Went here about a week ago during my lunch break. There were, really not exaggerating either, 6 people on the whole place. We ordered burritos  and literally had to get up towards the kitchen and ask about our food. I don't get how this was so slow. We took it to go and was given the orders wrong as well. They should have given us a discount or if anything free. They were not even apologetic about anything."}
{"text":"Love this new addition to Central Phoenix!  The location is perfect -- very close to work and walking distance from my gym (Yay!).  The interior is fresh and clean -- white table cloths even at lunch -- with really nice art on the walls, and they're adding an outdoor patio soon.  They do have a lunch menu, with everything around $10-12.  I had the Shrimp and Chorizo Burrito, which comes with rice and your choice of pinto or black beans -- I ordered pinto.  The food is clean and fresh -- you really feel like you're eating good, fresh, healthy food -- not a bunch of starchy food covered in cheese.  The rice and beans are very well-seasoned and not just throw away sides like they are at most Mexican restaurants.  The burrito was also very good!  The shrimp and chorizo were seasoned very well.  My only suggestion is to add some pico de gallo to the plate -- I think the flavor of some fresh pico would really complement the burrito well.    All in all, a great visit!  They have happy hour from 3-6, with half-priced apps and $1 off their signature margarita.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really nice, small restaurant with a great menu. Chips and salsa are nice too spicy in my opinion but pack a lot of flavor. Enchiladas de rez are delicious - the beef is so tender and the sauce is wonderful. Backyard carne asada steak is super tender - cooked a perfect medium rare, and again, so flavorful and delicious.  The rice and beans are all done nicely and compliment the main food items wonderfully. Happy hour menu is a bit different, so I am looking forward to going back and giving it a try."}
{"text":"So... Is this place still open? I tried on two separate occasions, tuesday and last Friday  to go here around 6 pm. No notes about the business taking a break. Nothing here or on their website and the phone just rings with no msg about then closing up shop for a few weeks or something.   It would be helpful to customers to give people a heads up about things like this. Here I'll do it for you. This place isn't open!"}
