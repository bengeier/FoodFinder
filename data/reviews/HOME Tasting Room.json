{"text":"My friend and I went here for lunch. 
We ended up both having the three course express lunch menu ($22). As other reviewers have noted, the menu here is VERY limited. 

Course 1 - Pacific Green Salad. Was fine, nothing special. 
Course 2 - Duck Confit Sandwich. This pulled duck sandwich was quite tasty, but could have been a lot more. It was on a plain hamburger bun placed in the middle of a large plate with nothing else. Presentation left a lot to be desired. On top of that, my friend found pieces of bone in her duck! 
Course 3 - Ice Cream/Sorbet. Was one scoop of vanilla bean ice cream (nice) and one scoop of cucumber orange sorbet (not tasty). 

With so many other places to go for lunch in the downtown core, I won't be rushing back here."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Home Tasting Room since last summer, but just never had the chance.
This review would have received a 5 star if they had more allergy-specific foods (gluten-free bread and/or soy milk). As well, the waitresses could've tried to put smiles on their faces.
Other than that, the food was exceptional. I had the red snapper BLT (minus the bun). It may be a bit spicy for some, but I thought it was one of the best dishes I've had out in quite some time.
I now regret that I haven't dined here more often!"}
{"text":"I didn't actually eat here but they catered an event I was at which was enough for me to write a review. The food they made for the event I see after looking at their menu they don't serve in house (which is fine) all the more alluring for me to go and try menu items now.

What they did make however was amazing! I had maple glazed pork belly which was like eating sweet bacon! It was so good. I have never been a fan of pork belly but I tried it and loved it. There was assorted pates at the event which I also tried (I don't like pate to begin with) I was good as well. They also had this AMAZING sour cherry jelly that I could have eaten out of the bowl.

That being said... I'm hoping to make it here for dinner one night so I can see what else they have to offer. Was super impressed from eating the small selection of appies at the party from them."}
{"text":"Home Sweet Home - I'm embarrassed to say it took me forever to get my appetite to this Stephen Avenue gem. Man, was I rewarded. Princess B, Afro Diva, and I enjoyed our time in The Room immensely. It's not a big room, but it's spacious enough where you feel unencumbered, its long shape evokes NYC resto, and the decor modern (love the doors on the wall of brick), even the washrooms are well adorned (three kinds of soap flaves!). The kitchen is situated and lit like it was a space aged observation room of culinary fineness. We started with the Hanger Steak (chimmi churri was yummy with the meat), Heirloom Tomato Salad (nice white gold mozza), and Basil Ranch Greens (honey comb & granola gave it a nice texture, peach dressing yumma); all were splendid. Main courses entailed the Creamy Mussels feature (needed to order extra crostini for the delectable sauce), Elk Loin special (some gristle, but not gamey), and Halibut En Papilotte (a little bit of molecular gastronomy: cooked & presented in mylar, both form & function - cool looking & kept poisson moist). All entrees were delightful. Finished with Gelato, made in house (as are many of their ingredients; which they pride themselves on, as they should), scoops each of: Blood Orange (like creamsicle), Chipotle Chocolate (choco & fiery tint), and Salted Caramel (sweet, salty, smooth). Dessert FTW! Princess B, for a digestif, had house special concoction Iced Coffee, she claimed it to be exquisite cafè goodness. Our server, Mike, who turned out to be the manager, was great, accommodating, attentive, and friendly. Maison Magnifique!"}
{"text":"Dear Home Tasting Room,

I like Caesars with a kick. Like a steel-toed boot kick, Veronica Corningstone-style. 

Your Caesars left me disappointed, dreaming of a time when hot sauce flew freely ... like two hours earlier at the Saddledome where I could do it myself.

One of your folks brought your wine list and boasted about the excellent selection. I saw a lot of offerings from Australia, which makes me thinks your tastes run a little bland, limited and unworldly.

I sure won't be paying $13 for a glass when I can head to the Liquor Box and get a whole bottle for $15.

[clink]

Cheeyahs!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quaint, cozy atmosphere to relax and chat with friends over wine and appetizers, then Home Tasting Room is a good option.

All of their food is sourced from sustainable providers, locally where possible.  They smoke their own bacon in house as well, which is always a nice thing.

The problem with all of that is that the menu items tend to skew to the high side.  Dinner entrees average around $25 and glasses of wine around $12-15.  The Tasting Plates, while perfect for sharing and are very tasty, are a little pricey for the portion sizes you get.

But don't get me wrong, the food is top-notch and what you're really paying for is the warm and friendly atmosphere.

There's no free wi-fi from what I could tell, but there were a few hotspots in the area that you could access from their location when last I was there.

Definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but if you're in the mood for a place that's cozy, warm, and quaint to chat with friends, Home Tasting Room is perfect.

If you're starving and looking for a bite to eat, unless you have deep pockets, you may find better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"I should start my review giving you a frame of reference of my expectations. Whenever I go downtown to have a great meal by great chefs with unique food -  I have high hopes. I always expect to have the moment where you take a bite and sink into your chair with delight. I did not have that experience here.

While the food was freshly prepared and unique, it was not exceptional. The gnocchi was over salted, the dip for the chips was bland, and the crostini where over buttered. That being said, the scallops and the beef tar-tar where great. But overall the meal could not be saved by a few stars. 

Despite the food, the location is excellent, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The waiter told us the owners are coming up with a new menu so I have not totally written Home Tasting Room off. Maybe I'll go back when they have re-thought their menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend went to junior high with the executive chef here and though they never really kept in touch, we were excited to try it out on our first trip back to Calgary since it opened. Luckily, we managed to kill two birds with one stone and hit up Home Tasting Room for something to eat after Stampede.

I have to admit, I was afraid of going here. The menu looks a liiiiitle pretentious and anyone who knows me knows I probably just bought a box of easy mac and all I want to do is go home and eat it. Alone. So I don't have to share. However, I think the atmosphere of this place can be summed up by the appetizer I got. I was really, really sick the entire week. By the time Saturday night rolled around, I was just beginning to be able to taste stuff again. I ordered a cream of tomato soup because I didn't really feel like eating but I wanted to feel loved (unhealthy emotional attachment to food? CHECK!). What came was a bowl of cream of tomato soup with a little disc of parmesan crisp and a healthy dose of lavender oil. It was perfection. It was just tomato soup but LAVENDER oil, you guys, LAVENDER. It was like a hug from the inside. Imagine taking a lavender scented bath when you've got the worst cold. Now imagine that lavender bath being in your mouth and then your belly. With bread. The lavender made the soup feel fancy (and it's tomato soup, so the jump to fancy is a long one) but it was comfort food, and that's what I got from this place. Fancy but comfy.

I can't wait to go back and eat here again and actually order some food. Though I didn't go too mad, I did get a chance to try the flat bread (with prosciutto, basil ricotta, roast red peppers and wild arugula) and it was insanely good. That and the raspberry and white chocolate creme brulee (I was sick, not dead). Minus one star because I don't think I can give it a five star without a least one proper visit. And another for lunch. Because being thorough is important. And tasty.

Oh, and in case anyone is interested (humour me!), I woke up CURED the next day. Lavender tomato soup and white chocolate and raspberry creme brulee -- the cure for the common but debilitating cold."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today... sat a little too close to the front door for a cold day, but the company and a delicious meal made up for it. Their lunch menu is very reasonably priced and quite tasty... we had the butternut squash soup, seared scallops, gnocchi and sticky toffee bread pudding.

Service was excellent as per usual and food was tasty and perfectly warm for a cold day."}
{"text":"Love this place.  We were wandering down 8th Ave trying to decide on a place to eat and came across Home Tasting Room.

Initial impression when we went in was a nice atmosphere and great decor with awesome 'fireplaces' attached on the walls.  We had a choice to sit at the bar, where you can see what the chefs are doing in the kitchen or at a table.  We chose to sit by the bar, which I highly recommend if you have previously wondered if what you see on Hell's Kitchen is actually how it is in a professional kitchen.  I will let you find out for yourself if it actually is!

Home Tasting Room is a bit like a tapas place where they have a selection of starters, dinner plates and large dinner plates.  The waitress recommended 3 dinner plates to share between the two of us, which was a good amount if you're planning on having dessert.

We had the Crab Ravioli, Bison Tartar and Scallops with Bacon.  The chef Geoff Rogers started us off by serving a 'Surf and Turf' amuse-bouche himself.  It was a prawn cream sauce with a slice of pork belly, and it was fantastic.  The belly wasn't too fatty but enough to melt in your mouth and it went well with the sauce.  The food was excellent with the bison tartar being my favourite among the three.  

Since we were watching all the dishes being made, I have to say the duck and lamb dishes both look amazing!  I will definitely have to try it the next time I go back.

I recommend trying this place!  Awesome food with a really relaxed and low key atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fabulous atmosphere and staff. Wine selection was well recommended. Portions not large, but reflected the intent of the restaurant - to try as many of the delicious creations as you want!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love Home Tasting Room. I really did. I am a big ol' fan of small plates/tapas and the room itself is good looking.

But something is missing. 

The menu isn't very...inspired. I liked some of the items, but overall I wasn't particularly impressed. Chips with cream cheese just didn't do it for me. And I too found the wine list a bit overpriced. My husband wasn't impressed with the beer selection either. 

I tried Home twice and like I said, I really wanted to love it. Kinda like in high school when you get a date with one of the popular guys - but he turns out to be only so so. 

I was looking for something more from this touted restaurant and I don't think it really delivered."}
{"text":"Lunch time was busy but the atmosphere was decent. 

The menu selection was interesting and there was't a ton of selection. 

My fish was undercooked so I had to send it back, no problems and they fixed it. However it is definitely on the more expensive side of things. A small piece of fish and about 6 fingerling potatoes will run you around $30. 

Not sure there was anything here to drag me back - my college had the lamb burger which looked great and he liked it."}
{"text":"i took my best friend here a couple weeks ago. Sadly forgot to write a review because I had to run straight to work afterwords.
It was a very very hot day outside and right in the middle of stampede hell week. We were looking for somewhere neither of us had been but wanted to be on the patio. Luckily there was a 2 person table right on HOME's patio. We were sat and immediately given water and asked if there was a wine we would like to sample before ordering it. We ended up going with the house white which was really good. My friend isn't as adventurous when it comes to food as I am, she's more of a meat and potatoes girl. So the menu looked quite confusing and she had to keep asking me what all the french terminology was and what certain food items were.
  
We both decided to get the Chicken Confit Sandwich (Okotoks chicken salad, confit chicken leg, lettuce,bacon, mustard cream). She had a side of the carrot ginger soup and I had a side of salad. It was fabulous! Just enough food so you don't overstuff yourself, perfectly seasoned and both of our sides were incredible. 

After lunch we decided to get desert. We got the Chocolate cheese cake,( chocolate \"air\", white chocolate paint)  and the Gelato tasting, (Salted Caramel,  Blood Orange creamsicle, Chipotle Chocolate.) The cheesecake reminded me of mud pie and it came in a really cute jar. The Gelatos were good, but I'm not a huge fan of the spicy chocolate one. However the blood orange really did taste like a creamsicle and i couldn't get enough of it. 

I will definitely be back here with some of my foodie friends or boyfriend to try some more."}
{"text":"I think Stephen Ave is one of Calgary's best looking streets, with its character old sandstone buildings and eclectic mix of outstanding shops and art galleries and restaurants - and lucky for us - the \"home\" of the Home Tasting Room.

Being charged with the task of making a reservation for family to celebrate my mom's birthday last Saturday, on a whim I made a reservation at Home Tasting Room. The restaurant has been on my list of places to try for a while now, and after an amazing meal, I'm wishing I would have visited sooner! 

As we were a table of 9, we decided that it would be better to order our own starters and entrees from the menu rather than ordering off the Sharing Plates menu. Everyone in our party was extremely satisfied with their meal, complimenting my choice in restaurant. My brother-in-law even commented that this may be his new favourite restaurant! So the food here was certainly a hit. 

The only factor taking this restaurant from a 5 star to a 4 star in my opinion was the wine list. We had noted on the website that HTR boasts a wine selection of over 50 wonderful wines, we were a little disappointed in the selection available. As we were out for a special celebration, we were looking for a nice bottle of wine. Unfortunately our first choice was almost sold out (they had only 1 bottle remaining, and for 9 people that just won't cut it!). Not being a crowd to turn down wine, we found a nice replacement, but it just wasn't the selection we were hoping for.

If you don't already have a \"Calgary Restaurants to try\" list started in your phone, I highly recommend you start a list and get this one on it.

Grilled radicchio salad

Not a fan of the salad what so ever. That said I don't think its because it was bad, it just did not suit my taste.

Fine Cheese Tasting

Loved the cheese tasting. Nice variety and great portions for 2-3. 

Bison Tartar

All I will say is next time I will get one for myself and one for my wife..... AMAZING!

Seared Scallops

Highly recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"Favourite Dish: Bison Tartar 

I've been to Home Tasting Room four times now. I found that when they were newer the food was better and more impressive (which is typical). The first time I went was about three months after they had opened and I was  definitely impressed. The second and third time, the food was average. The fourth time, which was pretty recent, was quite disappointing. I would say with my four experiences dining with Home Tasting Room, that the restaurant is an average place, while the food is not terrible nothing really stands out. I've also found that with my four visits, of the three, I've never been tempted to order any desserts! This is pretty rare because I usually know what I want for dessert before I order my main course! 

The first time I went to this restaurant I really enjoyed the Pacific Scallops with Brown Butter & Winter Squash, however, they took that off the menu. On my fourth time at this restaurant my boyfriend and I ordered the Bison Tartar, Chive & Ricotta Gnocchi and the Charcuterie Tasting Board. I enjoyed the Bison Tartar, it was fresh, soft and creamy. The presentation of the Chive & Ricotta Gnocchi was not very appetizing, but tasted decent and the Charcuterie board was mediocre - it didn't really standout from any other board. 

The restaurant itself has a very warm and homey ambience and the service is quite comparable to most upscale restaurants. I like their concept of \"shared plates\", but with my recent visit to this restaurant it is no longer on my top list of restaurants to dine at."}
{"text":"The food was perfect. The presentation of each dish was beautiful and each bite was delicious. It was quiet enough to converse and the lighting was nice  - dark enough to feel intimate, yet bright enough to be able to see your food! Service was great. Good date night location, but have been here with friends before and that means trying more dishes!!"}
{"text":"Lunch date #2 for Big Taste Calgary!

We arrived to Home Tasting Room at noon for our reservation, and were seated just across from the cooking area/kitchen. I glanced around and could see people enjoying the different dishes offered from their Big Taste menu so I was excited.

I already had my mind made before we came - salad and gnocchi please! (And my girlfriend had the same) The artisan salad came with egg, gruyere cheese, berkshire bacon and was drizzled with a dijon vinagrette. All the flavors worked really well together. It was a perfect size too, just enough to sedate my hunger until our meal came.

Our gnocchi arrived just as we finished our salads - (ricotta and chives) with rainbow swiss chards and portabella mushrooms. At first, I was like \"Why is the portion so small?\" but as I started to eat, I realized that gnocchi gets filling - FAST! The swiss chards gave the dish a nice crunch and the mushrooms were sauteed perfectly.

Dessert was house baked cookies (peanut butter, coconut and chocolate) accompanied with hot chocolate. Omg, each cookie was so good - both the chocolate and peanut butter somehow were creamy tasting and the coconut had coconut flakes in that burst with flavor! The hot chocolate was more like melted chocolate - rich and really coated your mouth when you sipped it. I guess I was thinking it would be like a regular hot chocolate you would make at home.

Service, food, ambiance was really great here. The only thing that kind of irked me was when the bill came and it said something along the lines of \"If you enjoyed your service, customary gratuity is 18%\" . . . I don't like being told how much I should tip, it seems kinda rude.

I liked that the entree we had is on their regular menu, and since my sister couldn't join us for Big Taste, I can bring her with me next time so she can try the gnocchi too"}
{"text":"Wifey had the Tartar - and thinks its the best.   I thought the scallops were better.  Love is tough..."}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable patio lunch at Home Tasting Room.  The experience could have easily been a 4- or 5-star rating, but during Stampede week the service and atmosphere suffered.

We started with two sharing plates: the BC rock crab cakes and the Alberta hanger steak.  We really enjoyed the crab cakes - there were 4 small (about 2cm diameter) cakes which had great flavor.  The tarragon buerre blanc sauce went really well with the cakes, as did the pickled cabbage and carrots.  The hanger steak was really tender, but I found the sauce and the dressing less flavorful compared to the crab cake plate.

The main lunch plate options consisted mainly of sandwiches, which was a bit disappointing on a hot patio day.  However, the BLT I ordered was really good - the heirloom tomatoes were colourful and thickly cut.  The bacon onion jam brought just enough sweetness to the sandwich.  The side salad had an awesome vinegary dressing.  The other 2 guys with me ordered the Reuben sandwich, which they really seemed to enjoy.

The service was a bit slow and distracted.  It was understandable given that it was a busy Stampede afternoon, and no one seemed to be interested in moving too quickly.  I'd really like to return one evening because I think that Home Tasting Room has the potential of providing an even better experience!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan even though the food is delicious -- there's just so little of it to choose from! The menu at HOME is severely limited, so it's a no-go for picky eaters. Thankfully, I'm satisfied with any high-quality meal so HOME was great but my vegetarian coworker had limited options. I'd go back here, but only if someone else suggests it."}
{"text":"Have to agree with other reviews. I was here a few days ago for dinner, and have to say that the menu is on the small side. I had the leak and potato soup to start along with the scallops. The soup was very tasty, but although the scallops were good they were a little on the lukewarm to cold side. I also had the beef tenderloin which wasn't super hot as well. All the food was tasty, just wished the temp was a little hotter."}
{"text":"The menu offers no surprises and the prices are as expected for a downtown restaurant.

The wait was a bit long for a lunch service where you have limited time only.

Food was ok - but again: if it was not downtown you would probably pay less for similar food."}
{"text":"Rude staff at finest! Did not bother to eat just left! Want good food great service go to Kensington Wine Bar. They know how make you welcome and enjoy your night out a the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I was there for a friend's birthday dinner last night. The restaurant was almost empty, and I wondered why. Oh because its on Stephen Avenue and no one stays on Stephen Avenue after 5pm. What a shame.

Anyway, on to this restaurant. I loved our circular 5 person table. It made for perfect conversation! I ordered a glass of Viognier and the bison tartar. The Viognier was very good, I am happy to say. Nothing is worse than paying $10 per glass at a restaurant only to find you dont like it. My friend on my left had the duck with risotto. I tasted her risotto, and it was excellent. Creamy, and meaty-tasting. Great texture. The plating was great too. But my friend on the right who had the salmon, her plating was awesome. They put her salmon on this little wax-paper box and covered it with another wax-paper box. Very unique presentation! My bison tartare came and I dug in. A lot of tartares run the risk of being flat or one-note. Not so at Home Tasing Room! The tartare was fresh, tasty, and had tangy notes and texture coming through at all the right times. They definitely did the bison justice! It was served with crostinis slathered with truffle mayo. YUM!
I finished my tartare entree with a glass of Tempranillo, which I must add, was also fantastic. 

The food was fantastic, but I wish the wine was a buck or two cheaper. I also wish there were more people in the restaurant, but that's not their fault, despite the great location.

I will totally go back and try more stuff from their menu!


22/30"}
{"text":"Tasty food, especially liked the Bison tartare, the meat plate, cheese plate with lavender honey, and trio of Fiasco Gelato for dessert. Some items were really good but less awesome, like the gnocchi (lacked a bit of flavour), and pork belly (just taste like extra-thick-cut bacon). Worth going if you have cash to spare and a small stomach."}
{"text":"Review #1 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012.

Food: 3.5/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5
Overall experience: 4/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

I was a little hesitant to try Home Tasting Room after seeing mediocre ratings from when it first opened, but after 20 minutes of  walking in the cold, my friend and I settled here since neither of us have been to Home Tasting Room. 

And boy, did I not regret my decision! The highlight of our \"linner\" was meeting executive chef Xavier Lacaze who competed on Top Chef Canada S02! He has been working at Home Tasting Room for about 3 months now. To some people, this means nothing, but as a foodie I was ecstatic and a little starstruck. Super nice guy =D

That aside, Home Tasting Room knocked out some stellar food! Their menu concept is \"shared plates\" which is ideal for those who want to try a little bit of everything. We arrived at around 3PM and ordered from their dinner menu. Their menu consisted of simple, fresh, ingredients prepared in a careful manner. There were a few starters (soup and salads), a list of shared plates (~$15-$23), and entrees (~$26-$30). 

We ordered their:

- Charcuterie Tasting with Local Artisan & House Made Meats which included salami, smoked bison which was my favourite, cured sausage, and slices of meat terrine. There was a delicious yellow (maybe peach or mango) fruit compote, homemade mustard, and pickled onions, egg, and carrots ($23). If you like charcuterie boards, I suggest sharing this dish among 2-3 people. The meats weren't overly salty and there was enough variety to keep the juices flowing.

- Pacific Scallops with Brown Butter & Winter Squash Puree, Pine Nuts, Turkish Olive oil ($17). The dish came with 3 large scallops and a parital one that were seasoned well and perfectly cooked; not rubbery at all. The winter squash puree looked like baby food and had an odd lumpy texture, but it tasted rich from the brown butter which is always a plus. Another dish that I recommend if you like scallops.

- I ordered myself two East Coast oysters ($3.50/ea) that came with a House Mignonette. The oysters were clean tasting and the mignoette was delicious; it wasn't overly vinegary-tasting and had a nice light hint of vanilla.  

As the restaurant's name suggests, the ambiance was very warm, inviting, and \"homey\". They have an open kitchen concept where guests can sit up front and watch their food being prepared. It's partial stone walls makes the restaurant very beautiful in a rustic kind of way.

Our food came out all at once and in a very reasonable amount of time; then again we were the only people dining at the time and we avoided the lunch/dinner rush. Our server was friendly, but when asked about the drinks and to explain what was on our charcuterie board, he wasn't very knowledgeable which was disappointing. His shift must have ended in the middle of our meal because we got a new waiter who was more enthusiastic and engaging with us. 

Overall, I highly recommend a visit to Home Tasting Room for a \"shared\" type of meal and for deliciously prepared wholesome food. I found the prices to be reasonable for quality ingredients and expert preparation. I was definitely full from and satisfied with my meal. 

I will definitely come back to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"After a rude encounter with 80th & Ivy, we decided to come to Home tasting Room, as I've been here before and my friend wanted to try it. 

We got a lovely seat on the patio in a corner, which was nice for the 4 of us. We decided to do tasting plates so we could sample more food. 

I have the mimosa to drink, which was delicious. For food, they were out of the bison tar tar which we really wanted, so that was one disappointment. We got the oysters, tenderloin rolls, scallops and the cheese plate. They were able to give me gf chips which was nice, so I could enjoy the cheese. For dessert we had the season pistachio rice pudding and milk chocolate panna cotta.

Service was a bit slow, especially for the restaurant not being overly busy. And price was reasonable I suppose. It worked out to be $45 each other tip and tax. I know that my hubs was hungry by the time we got home though."}
{"text":"This is a true Home Tasting Room, the name says it all.
A freind invited me out for my birthday and we were pleased by the small 'sample' wines.   
We sampled various dishes because that is what we do when we're out,  try new things.
Our favourite was the Bison Tartare, a wonderful surprise with extra toast when we asked.
I did have an oyster and it was fresh, slippery and delicious, just as a fresh oyster shoudl be.
The true heritage decor was impressive because of it's age and simplicity. 
We found the staff wonderful and the manager was open to suggestion.
Of course if you want a lot of  food and a glass of draft to wash it down with, there are plenty of restaurant chains and pubs around that will be a much better choice than  Home Tasting Room.
Tasting is what it's all about at the Home Tasting room.  So Taste Away!"}
{"text":"A nice atmosphere, good service, and tasty food makes this a place that is enjoyable to experience. The food was nicely presented and every dish was quite different then the next in terms of the taste. 
I wouldn't go too often but I am glad I have experienced it."}
{"text":"I had a really nice lunch here today - their sandwiches are delicious!  The restaurant was pretty quiet for the noon hour, and I would have liked to see some meal-sized salads on their lunch menu, rather than just sandwiches.  I had the chicken salad sandwich and it was a good portion.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"After a disappointing rained out experience at Fiesta Filipino, we decided to go to a warm, dry place for lunch.  We walked into Home Tasting Room and were pleasantly surprised to discover that it was open for lunch (well, at least until mid-October).  
My son had the HOME wagyu beef burger with homemade potato chips and loved it!
Hubby and I decided to try their Tasting Plates (the menu states that a tasting plate is not tapas, but made to be shared by 2 or more people):

Chive and Ricotta Gnocchi:  served with caramelized onion, kale, and grape tomatoes.  Lovely combination of flavours and bursting with freshness.  The gnocchi was amazing, pan-fried to a toothsome texture without being chewy.

Grilled B.C. Octopus:  grilled to perfection.  The celery and radish salad with ume/shiso emulsion and yuzu dressing complimented the octopus.  

Fine Cheese Tasting plate:  blue cheese, aged Cheddar, soft cheese(some kind of Brie?) flatbreads, fig preserves, peach butter.

Seared Scallops:  who could possibly imagine scallops tasting this good? They were seared beautifully and served at the perfect temperature with the remoulade. The hickory sticks added a contrast of saltiness to the sweetness of the tomato and parsley salad.

We did leave room for dessert.   My son had the ice cream and sorbets, while hubby had the dark chocolate terrine with Chai marshmallow and peanut butter dust.
I was fortunate to have the last poached pear with pumpkin seed praline. The sweetness of the pear and the poaching wine was a match made in heaven.

Overall impression: Chef Kaede Hirooka and his team are able to give their ingredients the respect where it's due and create art on a plate that's pleasing both to the eye and the senses.  We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Home Tasting Room has some of the best food in Calgary.  It is a small plates menu which I don't usually like but the food is so tasty that I drop that bias here.  If you're like me and get short changed on tapas sharing menus you'll need to take control of your portion of the order and make sure you get enough food."}
{"text":"Exceptional meal!!  Highly recommend this restaurant if you are interested in a superb dining experience.  The Chives & Ricotta Gnocchi sharing plate was one of the best dishes I have ever had anywhere.  You also must have the Apple & Almond Cream Tart with House Made Ice Cream.  It takes 20 minutes to make but is well worth the wait.  Order it early if you are in a rush.  I am from NY and this is my first visit to Calgary, but I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great first time here. Menu is small but good variety. Service was good and the food was very tasty. Portions are decent size but not generous.
The peanut butter and s'more chocolate dessert was solid. Highly recommend this restaurant for anyone wanting to try something new."}
{"text":"We went there Saturday an took a spot by the bar. We loved the food and the reasonably priced wine."}
{"text":"Home Tasting Room was a great experience. We headed over on a Friday night. Our reservation was at 6, I was running about a half hour late, but luckily it didn't get too busy until later so there was no problem. We decided in advance to sit at the bar, which ended up being a great choice. We really enjoyed watching them make the dishes (the cheese plate is very popular!)

We ordered a variety of dishes to share between the two of us. The ricotta & herb gnocchi was a no-brainer, we both love hummus so we dared try this one, which had horseradish in it as well, and we went for the beet salad, which seems to be a favourite for us lately.

They also started us off with a little taster - it had a pink apple on it, which was really neat. The wine was also great, although a little pricier than I'd usually go for.

Since the food was phenomenal, we knew we had to try dessert - we went for the chocolate peanut butter bar with marshmallow nougat. I wanted to lick the plate, it was that good.

I wavered between a 4 and 5 star for this restaurant, because it's a little on the high end for what I'd usually pay. But having started out the evening knowing it would be a pricier meal, and having enjoyed every bite, as well as the amazing service from the staff, I went with 5.

Oh, and the best part? My sister and I had been taking pictures and posting them to our respective social media channels all evening. As we got up to leave, the chef... no, wait... executive chef (!), called out \"Nice pictures!\"

{"text":"The place is owned by a friend-of-a-friend so we decided to head down and check out their evening fare.  

They've certainly done well with the atmosphere of the place - it suits the name.  Whoever completed the interior design did an amazing job.

I found the menu to be a tad underwhelming in terms of evening cuisine.

The winelist was quite uninspired, with some basic run-of-the-mill selections.

The server 's knowledge of the dinner menu was extremely limited.  She was friendly enough, just had no clue as to the details of any menu item...I would suspect she was new and just had not sampled anything off the food nor drink menu at that point.

The beef tartar was fantastic, as were the scallops.  

Given the location and potential of this restaurant,  it could easily become a \"5,\" with a few menu tweaks (i.e. don't serve potato chips with your $20 dip), and ensure your service staff has sampled the menu...it's the little things like that which have kept me from giving this place a higher rating.

All that being said, I've heard nothing but good about their lunch menu, which I would be willing to return to try."}
{"text":"Home is beautiful!  A friend and I went for dinner during Big Taste Calgary.  We got seats at the kitchen-facing bar and enjoyed the sights, sounds and smells of the kitchen all night.  The food is a work of art!

After a starter salad, we each enjoyed chicken served over barley, followed by dessert - carrot cake for me and creme brulee for her.  Fantastic!  Though, I have to say - they were cooking up some brownies and doughnuts in that kitchen that looked to die for!

Food may be a little pricey, but the portion sizes are good.  Definitely a pleasure!"}
{"text":"Since it opened, folks have been telling me to have my lunch over at the bar at Home Tasting Room. Yesterday I decided to take them up on their suggestion. As lovely an experience as it is at one of the tables, sitting at the countertop by the open kitchen makes for a different view of Home, and I like it!

Watching the kitchen staff preparing food for later, heck, even watching them make my own meal-right down to the garnish, was fun to see. Although, I'm thankful for the sneeze guard between us ;). Tip: If you watch them cut potatoes long enough, they might just start talking to you! 

Is it possible to admire your sandwich? I think yes. This time round, I ordered the Home Reuben. Thinly shaved slices of meat with homemade sauerkraut, and melted Swiss cheese between two toasted slices of bread. That was a worthy sandwich. The cup butternut squash soup was a nice addition. My meal at Home wasn't complete without a glass of their riesling and some apple cranberry crisp with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce on top. The riesling is just a smidgen shy on the sweetness scale of being a dessert wine, but that's just the way i like it.

Somehow, I've lucked out with having Ryan as my server each time I've been in. He's attentive, and knows his stuff (my first time in he recommended the bison tartar... it's still right up there!). 

I only wish my wallet could afford to eat here more often. That being said, my mouth and tummy thank me after each visit. And I do like the fact that I can order some of the wines as a 2 oz serving if I'm wanting to try them out, or just have a bit to sip with my food.

My other favourite part of the restaurant are the doors that are painted and hanging on the back wall. Have a look next time you're in, they're funky!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Bison tartar is where it's at!  Served with truffle crostini... it was the best thing we ordered that night!  So just go for the bison tartar and a glass of wine hahah.  

The rest of the food was just ok. small portions, higher prices, nothing stood out as special.... not even the foie-ffles... and I was looking forward to that too  :(   mini waffles weren't 'fresh' - they were room temp and floppy and the 'nectar' they had was wayyy too overpowering.

Totally open space on the inside with modern decor and open kitchen. 
Was not too busy the night we went so it was a nice atmosphere to catch up with a friend."}
{"text":"It was past 2:00 pm and I was walking along 8th avenue in Calgary.  I knew I had a big meal waiting for me at suppertime but I wanted to review at least two restaurants a day to make up for the single-day outings from the two previous days.  I recognized a few places from my previous list that I could visit, but I feared too many would ruin my appetite...and then I stumbled across Home Tasting Room, known for smaller dishes and copious amounts of wine.  And I do mean copious, as in profuse, as in the middle-act of the film Sideways.  
This is the point--Home Tasting Room is a wine-centric restaurant, combining the drink with market-fresh sustainable food (pulled from their website).  Sounds great...here's the problem:  I don't drink alcohol.  
Period.  
It's not because I'm a recovering addict or because my Mother used to whip me after a liter of box-o-wine because the meatloaf came out overdone (not true...she drinks port).  The truth is I never developed a taste for it.  That's it.  I would have a glass of bubbly on New Years and hated it every time.  Champagne is not a gateway drink.  I have sipped the odd hard liquor now and again but never felt I was missing something.  Never have I been tipsy to the point of being horizontal. I made such a confession to my waiter as I sat down.  He took the task to educate me...and educate me he tried.  
Back to the restaurant, though, the décor is superb.  A single long string of tables awaiting an obvious dinner reservation, a big bar with chefs working before my eyes, and wine glasses at every sitting.  If this was my home town, they'd be coffee mugs.  The theme is consistent, with rustic colors offset with stark contrast in green chairs.  
I love it when I can watch chefs prepare food in front of me, so I sat at the bar.  The menu was a simple selection of starters, lunch courses, and tasting options.  The prices were definitely intimidating.  A pulled pork sandwich for $16.50  better send me to the moon faster than Armstrong.  Homemade Mac & Cheese for 17 bucks better send me to Jupiter faster than Kubrick (I could cull another comparison, maybe Alpha Centauri with Cameron...maybe not).  
Anywho, after dishing out my sad tale of sobriety, the friendly and knowledgeable waiter with a panache for pronunciation rivaling that of a Scottish Shakespearean began explaining the do's and don'ts (mostly do's) about proper wine drinking.  Of course, this involved the drinking of said wine.  A smart reviewer would've written down brands.  I, still classed as an amateur, did no such thing.  They were various shades of red, all with a mild acidity to them, and my spine shuddered each time I swallowed.  I followed all the patterns of a proper connoisseur.  
I sniffed.  
I swirled.  
I swished.  
I swallowed.  
After two quarter glasses, I moved up to a full glass, more than I've had in the previous ten years of my life, I kid you not.  I have to point out, of course, that each and every glass I \"sampled\" was being tacked onto the bill.  It was like walking into a sushi bar and shouting \"omakase!\"  I could hear little cash register noises clacking each time the waiter popped a bottle.  
Of course, I had to add food, and why not the $23 Charcuterie Tasting (local artisan and house made meats, preserves & condiments), which also happened to be the most expensive offering on the menu.  This guy was a salesman of the highest order; thank Christ he wasn't selling me a refrigerator or else I'd have gotten the one with LED lighting, an ice maker, and a resident butcher.  The final bill came to damned near $50...for what accounted to little more than a snack.  I definitely got poured the good stuff.  Did I appreciate it?  How could I, I never drink wine.  I had to take his word on it.  I enjoyed the experience while I was sitting, and didn't feel cheated as I left.  I'm still not much a wine drinker and thank Odin I wasn't driving after.  I carried quite the buzz as I exited Home Tasting Room--expected for a virgin drinker after what amounted to little more than two glasses of wine.  
I did feel left out of place slightly.  Home Tasting Room is for couples and parties, not for single men wandering in from a hot Calgary afternoon.  Still, it was an experience to remember and I enjoyed it for what it was.  I know wine drinking is not for the faint hearted or the light wallet'ed, so I don't expect this to become a habit anytime soon.

{"text":"After spotting this gem from the Calgary tower (what can I say the red table clothes caught my eye), we decided to try this place out and damn we're we impressed. The charcuterie board was delicious and plentiful! Great value and very tasty. The service was great and the drinks were definitely affordable. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Home Tasting Room, and both times we've asked to sit at the bar where we could watch the chefs in action, and sometimes harass them with questions, which they always gracefully answered. 

The first time we asked to sit there at the bar was because the tables were so big that I felt like i had to speak louder than normal to have a conversation with my friend. But I found the bar cosy and fun, because there is always something to talk about when you can see all the parts of a plate come together.
My favourites from both experiences were the gnocchi, scallops and the beef bourguignon plates. 

The service was great, but I would've liked the plates to come a little quicker. I know (and overheard) a lot of attention goes into the timing, but there were moments where we got a little impatient.
Overall, it is more on the expensive side, but l quite enjoy HOME and will definitely return at some point."}
