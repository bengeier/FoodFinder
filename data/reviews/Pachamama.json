{"text":"Discovered this place randomly.  Being from New York City, I will say that we are used to the taste of deep fried empanadas, and all the greasiness and deliciousness that comes with them.  These empanadas are not that.  They are artesenal.  They are healthy.  They are on the drier side, and we were not given any sauces to dip.  The restaurant itself is very pleasant, and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Baked Empanada with lots of choice of fillings (beef, tuna, squash, caprese, spinach, corn).

Plus delicious soups, corn and cheese, and the famous Locro soup with chorizo or the vegetarian option, a must try. 

You can bring your own wine for a relax meal. 

Ask for Pablo the owner who is likely behind the counter looking after you."}
{"text":"Wonderful cafe, cheerful and charming, featuring a variety of delicious homemade empanadas.
To sit on the terrace and enjoy the lively flow of people on Saint Catherine is a great way to spend a summer evening.   The people who work here are so friendly, and it is a byob.  Soup and salads are also excellent.  This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Tout d'abord, les empanadas sont délicieux! Ceux-ci sont cuits au four et tellement tendres.  La pâte est légère et la garniture parfaite et en très bonne quantité. 

J'ai essayé celui au poulet (coup de coeur) et jambon et fromage (très bien). 
Facile à prende sur le pouce puisqu'on n'a  pas besoin d'ustensile, mais faire le plein de napkins pour le jus de cuisson qui peut couler. 

J'ai vraiment eu un faible pour le poulet, mais aucun doute que les autres saveurs sont excellentes.
Le proprio est vraiment sympathique et super consciencieux d'offrir de supers produits. 

À essayer lors de vos partys puisque les belles couleurs des empanadas sont festives et que ça se sert vraiment bien (voir la référence aux ustensiles ci-dessus) ou un soir de semaine lorsque l'envie de cuisiner n'est pas au rendez-vous!!

Pour le proprio : Tel que suggéré par mon ami Jeff S., ajoutez un empanadas au smoked meat et un à la tourtière pour le temps des Fêtes ;)"}
{"text":"Enfin, j'ai enfin pu y aller, les empanadas sont à tomber parterre. Le boeuf épicé est délicieux. J'en ai servi à mes amis pour une soirée qui ont adorés. Je pense qu'ils iront rendre visite aussi à Pachamama bientôt."}
{"text":"Wonderful new discovery.  Very good and interesting empanadas.  Very nice staff.   The gazpacho was thick and delicious.   Has a little terrasse.  Word has that it is BYOB.  Great for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Omg!!! The best empanadas ever!!! My husband is Argentinian and I used to called him el Rey de la empanada until today. I loved the variety, flavors, and presentation of the empanadas dish. We tried locro and humita which are soups typical from Tucumán, Argentina. The place is kids friendly, cozy and clean. We definitely recommend this place, plus the stuff in there are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Delicious, and really good combo deals for authentic empanadas. I would also recommend drinking a bottle of fizzy Maté with ice."}
{"text":"Les empanadas sont copieux et bons (même si je les trouve moins... subtils que ceux que j'ai l'habitude de manger en France), c'est pas cher et le personnel est sympa."}
{"text":"Great new spot for empanadas. A variety of flavours to choose from: chicken, beef, corn, tuna, etc... very colourful and tasty. Great area also with St Catherine street closed off to become a walkway. La Diperie is also around the corner if ever you want to grab some ice cream afterwards!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, but service was sooooooo long.. we waited over 15 minutes for 4 empanadas. The owner was nice but seemed a bit all over the place, I would guess from lack of experience... Bit on the pricier side as well ($3.25 for small empanadas is a bit much in my opinion). I would definitely recommend La Chilenita over this place: better bang for your buck and much faster service."}
{"text":"Amazing Empanadas!!!

Pachamama specializes in empanadas from the Argentinian province of Tucumán, which are recognized as the tastiest within Argentina.

In addition, the empanadas are made unique by using natural dying agents like spices, spinach, or squid ink to give each flavour a colour.

Traditional and gourmet varieties are offer. In addition to vegetarian and meat-lovers options.

The beef empanadas are made with diced beef instead of ground beef resulting in a tastier and jucier experience.

In summary, they are the best empanadas I have eaten in Montreal! They are even better than most empanadas I ate in Buenos Aires.

=====================================

NOTE (added 05/07/2017): The review by Catherine R (from 04/23/2017) recommending La Chilenita over this place, prompt me to get together with some friends and try both places on the same day!

The result: Pachamama wins by a landslide! Empanadas here are tastier and more filling (even when smaller in size). One way they are tastier (and juicier) is that they are made with cubed beef (instead of ground beef).

As for the claim that service here is too slow, this is because the empanadas here are baked right after you order! Whereas, La Chilenita re-heats their empanadas."}
{"text":"The empanadas are ok and the service was definitely lacking. I think the problem is taking traditional, delicious food-fare and trying to make it gourmet. It just ends up being neither here nor there and the flavours are watered-down versions of what one may expect from empanadas. Also, walking into a restaurant where the front of the house person is yelling at some poor women in the kitchen or having the same person slam your plate on your table and not even replying to your \"thank you\" because they are annoyed over something else, absolutely leaves you with a very bitter taste. Definitely over-hyped and definitely a disappointment."}
{"text":"Aaahhhhh Pachamama! Je pense que j'arrêterai jamais d'en parler de ces délicieux empanadas argentins! Comme je n'ai jamais encore mangé sur place, je ne peux commenter sur le service aux tables, mais la place est très cute et propre. Bon. Les Empanadas. J'achète un sac de 12 (35$) congelés, de saveurs variées (par choix). Avec les instructions qu'on m'a donné, ils sont parfaits, à tout coup! Les Empanadas: une pâte fine, colorée et croustillante, une parfaite quantité de mélange XX. Y'a pas meilleure combinaison selon moi! 

Mes coups de coeur...
- Boeuf épicé: Des cubes de boeuf (versus le traditionnel à la viande hachée) Wow, wow et rewow. Tellement goûteux. 
- Humita: Genre de mélange de maïs râpé (recette traditionnelle Inca) Oh My! Ce mélange est tellement bon. (Bonus: il est aussi disponible en soupe - en version un peu plus liquide!)

Les autres sont tous très bon, mais si vous me demandez quoi prendre, à part TOUT LE MENU... bein ce sont ces deux là!

Options Vegan et BYOB. J'suis dûe pour un refill.."}
{"text":"A warm and inviting cafeteria style restaurant with decorated cushioned benches along the walls.  I love the menu and the empanada \"glam shots\" on the walls! Very well thought out and attractive!  

We were served by one of the owners and everything he recommended was delightful--the soup, the beef, chicken and humita empanadas were beautifully wrapped and so comforting to eat :d The owner was so kind and attentive.  

They've elevated the humble empanada to stand alone! The beef and chicken are especially good with a drizzle of lemon.  The wraps were nice and crusty. 

I also had the beet salad which was good and the tomato, cheese, basil empanada but since I'm not vegetarian I preferred the meat ones more :D"}
{"text":"So happy to discover this new place! The owners are super nice and was more than happy to explain to me about the concept. I end up taking a 12 mixed pack frozen units to go.  Didn't know what to expect, it turned out to be surprisingly great!!  Will try a sit down lunch or dinner inside next time!"}
{"text":"It's 3:30 pm, my legs were shot, my tummy was rumbling, and the juice on my phone was running dangerously low---I needed free Wifi, a place to charge my phone, and a snack before dinner --- STAT!

My sister and I ended up sharing pachas aux poulet (chicken) and pachas aux épinards (spinach). Both were flaky and crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside. In fact, much to our surprise, one of them squirted on the table when we cut it open. Whoops!

This spot also has cute decor, free Wifi, and lots of power outlets. Great place to stop by for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner with a friend. We really enjoyed it. The ambiance is nice, the service was pretty good and the food was delicious. I ordered the soup, which is my favorite item, I definitely recommend it. My favorite empanadas was the Spanish. The other ones are fine."}
{"text":"The empanadas are good, the dough is really fresh and well prepared. The different colours of the dough are beautiful too. It's kinda pricey though, and the beef one kinda disappointed me (but to be honest, I had high expectations because 1. Argentinian beef! 2. Peruvians have really high standards for food) but the spinach one is delicious. I'm a carnivore, but that one was my favourite by far!"}
{"text":"I kind of love meat turnovers of any kind, samosas, dumplings and empanadas, so when I came by here to try out the beef and chicken empanadas, I wasn't disappointed. Service is really friendly and because it's right in the heart of the gay village , the people watching through the window is always fun. Just be warned the South American countries each have their own style of preparing empanadas, with regional differences mostly between Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. The empanadas here are definitely Argentinian-style."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and excellent atmosphere!
We'll definitely come back for more!!!
Love the beef empanadas! And the alfajores!!!"}
{"text":"I've just discovered this recently open amazing cafe with Argentinian specials. Las empanadas are the centre of the attention here... very well deserved. 

Homemade traditional empanadas in several different stuffings. Beef, chicken, tuna, spinach... there is an opinion for each an every taste! 

If you are sharing, don't hesitate to ask for platter of  8... I tasted and loved each and every one offered in the menu... but I have my coups de cur! Yes.. in plural... why I can't make up my mind? Parce que! 

Anyways... the buf épicé is definitely a must have. For the record... it is NOT minced meat, it's juicy, the meat is tender and the sauce is to die for! 

For those who love a more healthy and tasty choice... spinach with blue cheese... is there any better match?! Por Dios... it's just as perfect as it describes itself. 

I also had an alfajor for dessert because... well... it's alfajor. Come on."}
