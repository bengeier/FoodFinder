{"text":"It's our first time in Montreal and I'm sad we didn't find out about this place sooner! It was hip and inviting. The wait staff saw we were struggling with French and immediately switched over to English for us. They were all very nice! The coffee was superb and the food was both amazing and massive! My partner had the avocado Benny. The eggs were nested in full halves of avocados! It was delicious. I had the 2 egg deluxe with French toast. Yum! We had to take leftovers. If we have time to go back tomorrow before we leave we will! Or this will be our first stop on our next trip back! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I love this place, It's steps away from my house so I go every now and then for a quick bite.  Their lunch and breakfast menus have everything that you would hope to find at a burgers & brunch place, and I've yet to be disappointed with a meal I've had there.  The staff are always friendly and helpful, and can get you a speedy meal if you're in a hurry or you can take time and linger if you want. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with a Groupan, which makes me feel less bad for wasting my money! The brunch was below average compared to other brunch places I've to in Mtl; both in quality and portion. The service wasn't that great either. I'm not sure about the burger, but the brunch is really not worth it."}
{"text":"Other than the eggs being slightly overcooked, great breakfast/brunch. Potatoes were tasty, service was a little spotty when it came to refilling coffee. Only thing we didn't like was the atmosphere of all soccer on every giant screen in the place. Sort of felt like we went to a sports bar for brunch rather than a restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our first stop after myself and 10 friends settled into Montreal for a bachelors party. We went in on a friday afternoon, and I'm guessing because it was work hours, the place was completely empty. Nevertheless we settled in and hoped this would be a great start to our weekend. The staff, which was only one person at the time was great. He gave us suggestions on what to order, where to go for night life, and the city itself. I ordered the wings, because while i was a little skeptical that the restaurant was empty I thought \"Its pretty hard to F wings up\" and that was the case because the wings were excellent. A lot of my friends ordered what seemed to be two grilled cheese sandwiches with a burger inside, which I must say looked excellent. Overall experience was great for a place to stop by, take a load off and grab some quick bites"}
{"text":"\"The Obby\" burger was incredible!! Instead of the buns, there's 2 grilled cheese sandwiches with a thick and delicious burger in between!

The staff were incredible! Really knew their stuff!"}
{"text":"Good food, generous portion and good service.
Found this plc from yelp and definitely recommend this plc for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"One of the best veggie burgers I've had and the sweet potato fries were amazing! The waiter was very friendly and seemed to know the menu really well. Definitely planning on going back!"}
{"text":"Pour le brunch un matin. J'avais pris le \"avocado\" Benny... c'était E-NOR-ME !!! 1/2 avocat pour chaque oeuf bénédictine + bacon + pain + sauce... c'était un peu intense ! Par contre, c'était très bon :)
Après, pas d'ambiance particulière ni rien, pas une place très cosy pour un brunch."}
{"text":"Entre 2,5 et 3 étoiles. 

Belle ambiance.
Belle place.
Service sympathique et rapide. 
Fromage grillé: ordinaire. 
Sandwich déjeuner sur croissant: gras...intensément gras. 
Je pense revenir pour essayer d'autres plats...car je crois que nos choix n'étaient pas les meilleurs."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a hockey game! Nice atmosphere and fantastic service. Loved the Hutchison burger with caramelized onions and blue cheese. Yum!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good!
The decor was cute and inviting, I'm a fan of exposed brick and subway tile. We were quickly greeted and a given our choice of seats in the quiet upper floor. The waiter brought a chilled water jug to our table and the menus.
Unfortunately, our positive first impressions were not maintained. After some deliberation, we ordered the tex-mex burrito, the grilled cheese burger, and the two-egg two-pancake breakfast. We also all ordered cups of drip coffee. The coffee came quickly, in typical small diner mugs. We all finished our first cups.... and waited. No one came around to refill our cups, and the food took 20-25 minutes to arrive.
Immediately upon the food arriving at our table some issues were obvious: serving sizes were inconsistent with price, and where I had explicitly said I didn't eat meat and asked for the ham on my egg plate to be put on Paul's, but instead it was draped on top of my pancakes... We had to ask for it to be taken back and new pancakes. I'm not crazy fussy about this kind of stuff usually, but c'mon guys. I was clear. The homefries were well seasoned but not crispy, and poached eggs well cooked, with a perfect runny center. The pancakes, well, they were crepe-y and kinda sour. Not terrible, but not what I expecting. The grilled cheese burger was good, with two kraft-singles and wonder bread buns around a juicy home-made burger with thick slices of tomato and lettuce. The fries were really good, but the ketchup was weird. Kinda spicy, tasted more like a cocktail sauce? Paul thought it didn't taste very good, or at least the flavour palate was wrong. Our friend's burrito seemed good at first, if not a little small, but he later admitted that he likely only thought it was good at the beginning as he was starving. It was a bland mix of chicken and beef, and the salsa that was served with it had gone rotten. When we informed the server, he seemed unconcerned, not taking it away or bringing a non-fermented one.
The waiter never came to give us our bill, so eventually we got up and went to the counter to pay.

Poor, uncharismatic service, below average food, and long wait times. The place has potential, but there needs to be better oversight in the kitchen, and an improvement in customer service."}
{"text":"I went for brunch and enjoyed the space and the people working there were great. Just a minor problem when I got my eggs Benny and the eggs were cold and runny as heck. the rest of the meal was warm though."}
{"text":"Belle petite découverte dans le coin de Prince Arthur. On ne pense même pas qu'il s'agit d'un spot à brunch. Je ne sais pas si j'y suis allée à l'époque de l'ouverture mais le restaurant semblait pas mal vide, service encore incertain et cuisine correcte mais sans plis. Pas de découverte mais pour révisiter les classiques c'est une belle option. Et le resto est assez sympa à l'intérieur..."}
{"text":"Chill environment and juicy burgers. Peanut butter burger was nice but was kind of expecting more excitement from it and the Obb burger, was definitely a different take on a grilled cheese/ burger ;-), but enjoyed by my husband. The fries and homemade ketchup and mayo was delicious! The waitress who served us was super pleasant as well."}
{"text":"Ç'aurait pu être un endroit fantastique qui aurait ravi les files de ces restos où attendre devant, quelle que soit la température est signe de bon goût. Hélas, cette cuisine ne ravira rien à personne. D'abord, c'est très gras! Il y a de l'idée, l'intention de créer des plats qui sortent des sentiers battus. Telles ces assiettes déjeuner évoquant le Mexique. Mais il faut de la maîtrise et de l'assurance, tout comme de la constante dans la création. 
Cela dit, je n'ai rien aimé. M'en tenant aux classiques oeufs bacon, j'ai toutefois reçu des résidus de fritures en guise de pommes de terre. Le jus est fait à partir de concentré. Les bénédictines ont un goût que je n'arrive pas à qualifier. Chose sûre, le gras est au rendez-vous. 
Le service? Machinal. Peu attentif. On demande du pain blanc, on en a du brun. Le serveur est affairé à l'étage supérieur (nous étions en bas) et il faut donc espéré qu'il fera une tournée pour demander qqchose. Ou alors, partir à sa recherche.
Expérience désastreuse, donc, qui, je le souhaite, sera effacée par une meilleure cuisine."}
{"text":"Walked into this establishment hungry and tired & came out full and pleased. With a strong mimosa and a delicious burger (Swiss cheese mushrooms onions bacon and 6 lbs of beef patty - forgot the name) this place was amazing!! The waitstaff was helpful in a time of need and just all around wonderful! The atmosphere is welcoming and warm and it's amazing"}
{"text":"Ouvert depuis novembre 2015, nouveau resto déjeuners/brunchs (qui sert aussi des burgers comme son nom l'indique) dans le quartier, enfin ! Ma copine et moi, aimons découvrir les nouvelles places à Montréal et finalement un nouveau resto au coin de ma rue. Encourager l'économie locale quoi. Sommes déjà allés 2 fois. Les oeufs bénédictines \"avocado benny\" étaient délicieux. Le service était courtois de la serveuse. Seul bémol, un manque d'ambiance/déco vide, sans âme, mais sinon, la bouffe était bonne. On reviendra quand même pour la bouffe, ça changera des autres restos déjeuners du coin...! Une belle addition sur Prince-Arthur. Wifi gratuit. Cartes de crédit/débits acceptées. 

3/5 visité en novembre 2015."}
{"text":"Right below our hotel is this place.  If you are in Montreal, you MUST visit here!  You will be in food euphoria when you leave.  Trust me, your plate will be cleared!  

Get the Avacado \"Benny\".  The best brunch dish!  You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Yo. YOOOOOOOOO!!!!! THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING!!!!

This was our first trip to Montreal and the very first thing we ate in the beautiful city, and this place set the bar high for the rest of the trip.

The staff here were amazing. Sat us down, walked us through the menu, educated us on poutine, and gave some amazing recommendations for things to do in the city. Aside from the stuff that any restaurant would probably do to tourists, the simply provided great conversation and interaction with us.

Now being that we just came from a very long drive up, we were famished. As a result, we heavily indulged in everything this place had to offer. For the table, we got both the classic and jerk poutines so that we could dive head first into the local culture. Do not fear the poutine. To my Yanks, it is very reminiscent of mashed potatoes and gravy you have every year on Thanksgiving. The main joy of this experience came when my burger arrived. I've heard stories of such a burger, but never did I think that we would one day be face to bun. On this day I ventured to try the famed PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY BURGER! Yes ladies and gentlemen, we're talking smooth peanut butter, we're talking pepper jelly, we're talking cheddar cheese, and oh yes all on a beefy burger. I took my first bite and immediately became a believer. All these ingredients that should not work, completely worked. I wanted to slap the chef for having the nerve to put something that good in front of me! How dare you sir!?!?

Definitely take a stop in to Orange Burgers & Brunch. Be down with OBB."}
