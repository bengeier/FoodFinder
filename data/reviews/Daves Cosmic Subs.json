{"text":"This is the perfect choice on a hot day at the zoo. I got the veggie sub with sprouts added. The sauce they put on it was truly so yummy .  Now we just need one in parma / seven hills/ independents area"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sub place. I've never heard of them before the zoo and I realized they were a chain which makes me happy. We didn't know what to get so we got the cashiers opinion. The Crazy Daves is the best.  The people making the subs were amazing as well."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise!  We'd never heard of this place and now I see it is a huge chain.  We were at the zoo and usually that means either eating in the Rainforest area or  Pizza hut (there is a McDonald's).  I highly recommend it.  The sandwiches are huge and served on a really, really good Italian roll.  I love anything spicy and the sandwich I had was that - almost too much but not really.  My husband's first reaction was how good the rolls were.  Finally, someplace good to eat when we go to the Zoo.  We are members and so are there quite often.  It really was a wonderful surprise."}
{"text":"-Limited Menu, Unlimited Taste-  I used to go to Dave's Cosmic Subs in Macedonia all the time, in fact, I've probably eaten half the menu there. While at the Cleveland Zoo, I noticed that they have a location in the food court area.  The line was long, but moving at a steady pace, so we hopped in line. Sadly, they didn't have the \"Super Dave\" sub I'm used to getting, but I quickly was able to find an option that suited me. I ordered myself a \"Crazy Dave\" sub and eagerly waited for my name to be called.  It's just as good as I remember, so I wasn't surprised that the line was longer than Pizza Hut and McDonald's lines combined. Their sandwiches are made from seemingly fresher ingredients than most of the food places that the zoo has to offer. It's a bit sloppy (overstuffed with meats, cheeses, and vegetables), so be prepared to ask for napkins.  The prices are great for the portion size, I'd say that the price is about the same as other locations (I know some zoo restaurants have inflated pricing). You could get away with splitting a sandwich with a friend, or saving half during your walk of the zoo.  By far, this is one of the best places to stop and grab food at the Cleveland Zoo, it's located at the food court next to the indoor seating area. I highly recommend that you try it out if you're looking for a healthier option that tastes fantastic."}
