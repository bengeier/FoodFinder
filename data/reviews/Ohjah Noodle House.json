{"text":"I've been to a few ramen places in town and came here with my friend (who's a big ramen fan). We love how tender the meat was and the broth was perfect. Not too salty and greasy like other places we've been too. Most of all, amazing service as well. New ramen spot for us"}
{"text":"A good ramen spot. Staff is friendly and attentive. Tonkotsu Ramen is tasty. Noodles are just the right texture, similar to Ippudo. Flavorful broth, with the option to spice it up. Chashu pork is tender. A good place to go to get a ramen fix in Las Vegas.."}
{"text":"My favorite ramen place is Koba's in Himeji Japan..... my next favorite is now Ohjah's Noodle House on Durango Drive in Las Vegas.
I had the Tan Tan Men extra spicy.... overall it was great... I could have had a 2nd bowl.  :-)
Additionally, the staff was very attentive and very friendly to us.
Overall..... a very pleasant experience.   I hope to return soon for more good eats!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely delicious! Excellent service and really great noodles. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant staff are really friendly. Here for the first time the restaurant is nice and very spacious. Ordered the Tan Tan Men very delicious."}
{"text":"Best ramen I have ever had. I suggest the Tonkotsu Ramen it is extremely flavorful and has great textures. The service here is also impeccable from the moment you walk in with the staff's blow away greeting until you leave. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If it were based on service alone, I would give them a 5. Impeccable service and anticipates needs. I like the extensive menu, being able to customize, and the choice of non-traditional toppings. I also like being able to adjust the spiciness of the broth. Just a star off for the noodles as they were on the chewy side. The gyoza was grilled perfectly. The miso and house ramen were good, but the tantan men was just a little bitter for my liking. Extra broth was on the house - yay! Will come back next time for the other types of ramen as well as for dessert."}
{"text":"Tried this place out sice it is near home and it was a pleasant surprise! Got the miso ramen and the broth was nice and the noodles had a nice bite. The gyoza was really good too! Glad theres all these new ramen places opening up in the southwest."}
{"text":"Nice addition to ramen shops available here in Vegas valley. Oxtail is a genius move."}
{"text":"Order the Oxtail!  It is sooo tender and soft!  The kids loved the cream soda.  The ramen broth was very savory and well made.  The atmosphere is welcoming, clean and more spacious than other noodle houses! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a great neighbor find. Very few guests on a Sunday night, but that just means more personalized service. I got the oxtail ramen and the flavor was very good, but I must admit I added chili oil into it before I even tasted the original. I love my food spicy! Server was very nice and brought me some chili paste without my asking because I didn't think the chili oil was spicy enough. Perfect local spot."}
{"text":"Their noodles are really tender and soft and their soup isn't oily unlike some other ramen places we have been. Their service here is also really good they are willing to make your ramen exactly the way you want, when they bring it out to you they check to make sure it's the way you like it."}
{"text":"First time here. Our food was really good and service was excellent. Highly recommend Ohjah. We will back here soon."}
{"text":"We decided to drop in on Valentines Day for some ramen. We started with the squid skewers which came out super quick and were delicious. My husband and I both had the Ohjah house ramen and it was awesome. The oxtail meat was really tender and broth was perfectly salty. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food, and service here is great. It's always nice coming here. This is our to go to place for our family day out when we're craving for ramen."}
{"text":"Nice door, good ramen, & great service.  The ramen is very good.  Ask for the hot sauce on the side.  It's so good and fresh.  The Katsu is very light batter and pretty good portion.  They even give you Japanese candy at the end of the meal.  I would definitely go again.  Oh yeah, they give kids a chopstick holder thing, that turns a regular chopsticks into kid chopsticks.  We love kid friendly places."}
{"text":"I'm laughing out loud when I see peeps saying ohjah is  
High class jap restaurant.... I orders a tan tan noodles which I knew wasn't a jap noodle but was expecting something unique.. but the broth came out cook to warm at most... tasting the soup wasn't even spicy at all.. other 2 peeps order the ohjah house noodle with tonkatsu broth... the oxtail was HARD!!! TOUGH!! My god if you wanted to do something special at lest do it decent... also asked for super spicy or highest lvl but of course not spicy and was asked to put schimimi powder on it haha... service was decent or good.. but taste wise I would recommend some other place.. sorry"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, service is great, I'm stuffed, and happy. This place is great for a date night, to family dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious tan tan ramen. Like extra spicy. Had Shelly temple!!? Pretty decent Nice servers!!!"}
{"text":"Drove pass by and decided to try the place out. Been to kobo down the street the week prior. Has less of a spice in the soup than kobo. Soup was pretty hot, some hot pepper or seasoning goes well with it. Would come back next time."}
{"text":"This is one my favorite places to eat ramen. Prices are great, service is always wonderful, and the food is delicious. This has become the spot for when I am craving ramen. It can get packed during dinner rush but, there's usually available seating.
The portions are a great size and very filling. 
The miso is my top pick.
Would highly recommend! Great Place and no complaints."}
{"text":"This restaurant is probably one of the best noodle house we have tried. Good food and good customer service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"STOP PASSING THIS UP DURANGO!!   Yeah, this is your Ramen spot to go. First the service is on point. Then the food comes followed by immediate gastric pleasure. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I went here late night with my friend about 10 minutes before close. The staff was very welcoming to us even though they were almost closed. Cody, one of the servers there, was very attentive to us and offered us great recommendations. The food came in good time and was very good! We ordered ramen and chicken wings with green tea mochi for dessert. Thanks for taking care of us at such a late hour! We stayed probably 20 min after the place was closed. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. The broth is amazing and the service is great. I was so excited when Kobo opened so I could get my ramen fix close to home but was disappointed in the meal. 

Tan tan men ramen added black garlic oil 5/5. - wish it was spicer but all good.
Ohjah House - 5/5 (per my friend, I didn't try)
Gyoza 3/5"}
{"text":"Delicious and very close to home!  It's nice to not have to drive to China town for some ramen!"}
{"text":"While it may not be my favorite Japanese, neighborhood restaurant, Ohjah Noodle House does special place in my heart. I ordered the ramen and was surprised at how homey the broth felt in my throat. The noodles were cooked to al denté and left a pleasant, yet sparkly, note of coriander on my palate. And let me tell you about this egg, it was off the hizz-op! Can't end this post without mentioning Ohjah Noodle House's AMAZING service, particularly Holly Wong. She was radiating and helpful to me, insistently asking if I wanted more noodles, to which I said \"yis pls.\" Best waitress I've ever had. Ohjah Noodle House: 10/10 would recommend again."}
{"text":"First of all, atmosphere is really good!!!! Super super cool!!!! There are bunch of appetizer.  And also Ramen's testa is really good!! This is really close to Japanese style!! Thank you so much!!!!"}
{"text":"heard about this place from a friend of mine. saw that they have oxtail ramen and caught me. nice environment and very nice and helpful staff. and most of all, the food is really good!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken ramen and added beef into the dish. Beef was not tender, it was so hard to chew and was quite disappointed. The Tonkutso Ramen was cool when it was served also. My expectations are a bit high before but now I am not sure. Perhaps, I will come back and give it try again sometime in the future and hopefully it will be better."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place. The noodles in oxtail broth are so delicious and also like homemade. The service is very excellent and the servers are extremely pleasant. Moreover, the place is very very clean and neat."}
{"text":"First time here! I eat at ramen restaurants fairly frequently and thought I'd try Ohjah because it's new. I had the Shoyu Ramen with extra egg and seaweed. It was amazing! I added a little bit of the spicy rayu which added the perfect amount of kick. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here last night. I must say the place is cozy. The service  was superb. Staff were very nice. I ordered tonkutsu ramen it was a bit salty for my taste bud but overall my experience was pretty good. I will recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious and super friendly attentive servers.  We used to go to the noodle place up the block from here but there's only about 6 tables and a few bar seats so you always have to wait and then they rush you through your meal. This place is just the opposite. Great, fresh made noodles with lots of tables and friendly service.   
Nice environment for kids or date night."}
{"text":"Had the Ox tail ramen,  the broth was thick and creamy with an abundance of flavor. Came with a couple of pieces of pork and a little bit of veggies, and a piece of nori.  It was good.
The ramen was smaller in diameter than I accustomed to but was cooked well without being overcooked.
Fried rice was just that fried rice nothing special. The ginger that came with the rice was a good palate cleanser.
Takoyaki, has a lot going on with sauce and such.  Was deep fried and interior was a little mushy. Had one piece of tako inside. 
Was speaking with the worker there and he was a interesting fellow. 
Wife had udon and she said it was good."}
{"text":"Attention to detail with their presentation and flavoring. Worth the trip and very welcoming to first timers or ramen enthusiasts!"}
{"text":"So I am no expert on noodles, but I do know good flavor and this place has that. I got the specialty house bowl. It was really good. I have tried ramen now several times at many places and have just come to terms with the fact that the meats used in ramen are usually pretty fatty. I am fine with picking around the fat to taste the delicious meat. Keep this in mind though if you don't enjoy fattier meat. I also got the potstickers and they were really good too! Above all, the service was great. Almost everyone working talked to me and asked how I was and if I'd been there before. They were all lovely to chat with and watching them prepare the food was enjoyable because I ate alone. In all, great people and service is what keeps me going back to a restaurant and this will be the case here too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for ramen!! I love the miso ramen but i get it with thin noodles! The staff is very friendly. Service is very good, place is clean."}
{"text":"personally i didnt like it

there wasnt as much flavor in the soup 
we got ohjah ramen and miso ramen

the meat in the ohjah ramen wasnt that tender and the miso ramen was not that flavorful

if u want ramen I would recommend fukumimi"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. We had the House Special Ramen and the Oxtail Ramen, which was really good. Service was excellent, they were very attentive...Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"So wanted some spicy noddles to help me get over a cold. Was not disappointed. Everything we had was flavorful and delish. At checkout we said we were yelping and they threw in appitizer for free. I had the tan tan men right amount of spice. Would suggest this to anyone wanting flavorful Ramen."}
{"text":"We came to eat for Valentines Day, we just got back from hiking. My fiancé and I got seated right away. Service was very quick and host greeted us with a smile. Our food came super quick, I ordered the house special with ox tail and my fiancé had the tan tan men. Super delicious and filling. During our dinner, the employees checked on us twice to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. For our first time we definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"We are familiar with the Ohjah name from the hibachi locations, and this location did not disappoint. The same friendly, and customer service orientated atmosphere paired with the amazing ramen was the best on a cold winter night. Thank you to Leo and his team for making us feel welcome and keeping our bellies full!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah! Or should I say \"Ohjah\". So this what ramen is suppose to taste like. Good noodles, good broth, good sauce, good service. My favorite noodle spot so far."}
{"text":"Friendly staff from the moment we walked in. Helpful with menu questions & attentive throughout our meal. Spicy Shoyu Ramen with chicken instead of pork was a great choice. Will return to try more delicious options!"}
{"text":"To tell you the truth, one time I wanted to try Kobo Ramen up the street (small venue & there's almost always a lengthy wait) so the Yelp gods brought me here and I was ecstatic it was only 2 blocks away! I was happy to see this restaurant was much bigger with bar seating as well as a good amount of booths and tables -- and we were seated right away! The great service and consistent food has made this our go-to ramen spot since it's just a minute from our house (and we can eat right away)! 

Some faves: 
- SEAWEED SALAD ($3.25): Appetizer side size of seaweed salad topped with sesame seeds and a side of lemon.
- FRIED OYSTERS ($4.95): Four decent sized oysters deep fried, served with a side of lemon. 
- OXTAIL RAMEN ($9.75): Oxtail, bean sprouts, scallion, eggs, seaweed, wood fungus 
- TONKOTSU RAMEN ($8.95): Chashu pork, bean sprouts, scallion, wood fungus, egg, seaweed
- HOUSE SALMON ($9.25): Salmon served with a light salad
- CHICKEN KATSU ($8.75): Chicken katsu cutlet served with a light salad

The service along has us wanting to come back here! Extremely friendly, attentive... oh, and they gave us free green tea mochi also for dessert! OH OHJAH, we will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Service was quick and extra friendly! Tan Tan ramen (extra spicy!) tasted amazing. Nice neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I tried a tantan noodle and my boyfriend had a ohjah house noodle.

My noodle was Salty and poured half cup of hot water and meat in his noodle had some smell.

But service was goood."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly upon entering the restaurant. The server was helpful and explained the menu in detail since my friend and I were first time visitors. 

I had ordered the gyoza and a regular tonkotsu. The gyoza was steamed and the meat inside was flavorful, though it did not taste that fresh. For the tonkotsu, it was average. The broth seemed watered down and not as creamy as other tonkotsus that I have had. The chashu pork was not that flavorful and was a bit too fatty for my liking. But, the egg was cooked well where the yolk was very creamy and not hard boiled. Overall, I did not think that their ramen was memorable."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant a couple of times already with friends and family after they open. Every time order a different ramen. I must say all of them are tasty in a different way. But if you need a recommendation you need try the special Ohjan house ramen. The Ox tail is tender and easy chewing, chashu is very yummy without a lot of grease. And their appetizers are fresh and quick serve. My favorite is definitely the Takoyaki. Their servers are very nice and helpful. Best advantage of this ramen house is it has a lot of parking space. You don't have to drive around to find parking."}
{"text":"3 of us stopped into Ohjah Noodle House on a last minute need for dinner on a Friday night at 8p. The place had several tables opens and the staff quickly and kindly greeted us before showing us to a booth. We could see the kitchen and it was busy with chefs handling several incoming orders. 

Our waitress was super friendly, helpful and accommodating to our various dietary needs. She even called one of the chefs over to personally explain a few menu items and ingredients to ensure there would be no issues. 

The food was delivered quickly and hot! My ramen (Shoyu substitute chicken) was incredibly flavorful and well balanced. Most importantly, the noodles were cooked PERFECTLY. 

We also had chicken Katsu. It was well prepared and delicious. 

Takoyaki was nice, though the octopus was barely there.

Chicken egg rolls were full of meat and piping hot. 

Total bill was ~$10/person and I would highly recommend this for lunch/dinner, in a hurry or wanting to take your time, date night!!, family (w kids 8+)"}
{"text":"Definitely, my new favorite Ramen restaurant in Las Vegas. Very clean place and excellent service too."}
{"text":"Raman was awesome.  We had the beef and ox tail.  Service was amazing; they kept our glasses full and were very attentive.  This place is a must!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! The house beef was amazing!! A must. Also the house fried rice is the bomb!!! Service was great I didn't even have to ask for my water to be refilled. Ramen was good but the next time I go here I will order the house beef and house fried rice again!!!"}
{"text":"After seeing so many good reviews about this place, my family decided to try them. We ordered takoyaki and garlic edamame for appetizer, vegetable fried rice with Ohjah house ramen for my entree. And they are delicious!!!! My favorite is the fried rice, it turns out to be a lot bigger at the portion out of my expectations and I have to take most of them home. I really love the way they makes those ramen soups not too salty which most of other places do. They also make the broth of the real meat instead of using stock. ( you can actually see that from the kitchen see through window).

Service are overall very nice, waitress quit attentive and helpful. 

On my top list of to go places!!!!!"}
{"text":"From the same company that does the teppanyaki, this place does some good food with a nice atmosphere! Service was excellent and food came really fast. There are some other great ramen places out there and this place comes reeeealy close. 

Notable unique dish is the Oxtail Ramen which we'll need to come back to try."}
{"text":"I was recently craving ramen, took to yelp for some suggestions, and came across this gem! Started with some fried oysters which were delicious and chose the tonkotsu ramen w/ ramen chili paste for that extra kick. The broth, the tonkotsu, the egg, let me just say everything was perfect and flavor was AMAZING!! I will definitely be back and recommend to all."}
{"text":"Came here because Ramen Kobo was closed and I'm glad because it was a nice little find. Cody was great, he was really helpful with everything and attentive. Now on to the food. I ordered the Ohjah house ramen special with oxtail it was really good. The house special fried rice was also pretty good the imitation crab was meh and the pan fried shrimp noodles I could have lived without. The chicken wings and tako wasabi were a nice way to start off the meal ."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by our friend so we thought we would give it a try. I ordered tonkatsu ramen and takoyaki and squid skewers for appetizers. Tonkatsu ramen came with pork, egg, scallions, bean sprouts, and black mushrooms. The tonkatsu broth was really rich and flavorful and comes with thin noodles, which I prefer over the thicker one. And the charshu slices were super tender. So good. Ask the server for fresh garlic!!! I think it makes a huge difference in the flavor of the broth. The service is on point and everyone is so helpful."}
{"text":"Amazing find in the southwest area, a definite must try if you love ramen as much as I do, and let me tell ya, I freakin' LOVE ramen. I will be a regular here, without question."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen.  Some of the best I have had.  Fair prices, nice atmosphere, good service.  

I tried the oxtail ramen...it was so Good!  The others in my party all liked theirs as well."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I normally don't like ramen because it's so salty for me.  However, this new ramen place is amazing!  I ordered the Ohjah house special ramen and it's not as salty as I thought which is great for me!  And the service over here is very good. People are nice and the waiter also asked if I want more broth for the ramen too. I'm sure I will be back with my friends"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time because I've been hearing that this place just opened and I didn't regret coming! I'm usually not a big ramen fan but this place definitely changed my mind on it. My family ordered the beef ramen and the shoyu ramen. Both tasted super flavorful, the soup was perfect. The takoyaki was hot and fresh! I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here on two separate occasions just in the last week. They treat their customers very well. Very friendly staff. Every menu item that we ordered was beyond delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. And there prices that are online on the menu dont even match . Im talking an extra 3$ . Verybad experience will not come back."}
{"text":"First time having ramen and I was not disappointed. The service was exceptional. A must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Fast service, food was tasty and our server Sisi was wonderful. Will be back very soon. Be sure to order the pork fried rice, it was exceptional"}
{"text":"Love my favorite Tan Tan! Clean, spacious and much more seating than other noodle shops. Also, Leo is the best! He's always there and so attentive! Be sure to say hello!"}
{"text":"Love this ramen place. Came here a week ago to try oxtail ramen and now we're back! Our new fav ramen place because it's close by, reasonable price and their Takoyaki is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I liked the menu selection and the customer service was great. Didn't have to wait for a table. The price was a bit steep for a night out but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Service was great and food was good. Ordered medium spicy tonkatsu shoyu and shoyu ramen; they were tasty. The spice level was a little lacking to be considered medium. Gyoza was great too. And I wrote this for a free appetizer lol."}
{"text":"This place is a little slice of heaven.  Cozy and quaint.  Awesome food and atmosphere.  Cooked right in front of you.  Entertaining and friendly staff.  Cocktails created to perfection.  Simply a memorable evening awaits you."}
{"text":"Creamy white broth, full body flavor.. in this satisfying bowl.. need I say more? Ramen game strong here in the Southwest, seriously! 

You maybe familiar with Ohjah as they have sushi and steakhouse restaurants throughout the Vegas Valley.  This restaurant specializes in ramen only.

Basic bowl : The base includes Chashu, seaweed and bean sprouts. From there you can choose different broths stocks, Tonkatsu, Curry, Shoyu, Vegetable, and Miso.   There's also a selection of set of 'House Special Ramen' you can order.  Also as with Ramen-Ya in the valley , you can add addition toppings for additional charge. 

I went for the Ohjah House Ramen from the House Special Ramen section.  Tonkatsu style broth, Oxtail, beef, Chashu, and soft boiled egg. When this huge hot steamy bowl was presented to me I knew I was goin to LOVE it! Man, that broth! Texture was like silky. Noodles are fresh, al dente, 2 bones of tender Oxtail, Chashu (pork belly) slice also dissolved when you took a bite. Perfect bowl of ramen! And it was just $9.75! Really reasonable price. 

There are also appetizers you can get, but I just glossed over that part and did not read what they had since I wasn't super hungry, so I'll leave it up to you guys with the bigger appetite to report back on it. 

I like that this place is spacious and not cramped like other noodle houses. Looks like they accommodate more people too. Kitchen is enclosed with window facing the dining area, so you have a clear view of what's going on in there. 

Service was excellent! Host will take you to your table and will also be the one to check you out when you are ready to leave.  The servers were great! My order was taken promptly and came out quick. Kudos to the attentive server who offered more broth to warm up my ramen cause I got a little distracted taking pix. :/... that was really nice, he didn't have to do that. Thank you! 

Anyway, if you are in the area near Ikea, btwn Sunset & Warm Springs on Durango , you'll find this place by the new EOS Fitness gym.  Definitely making this place my go-to for ramen out here."}
{"text":"Just came from here. Delicious, different ramen! All bowls include an egg, unlike everywhere else. Tonkotsu and beef bowls were awesome and huge. The takoyaki was disappointing, only one one centimeter piece of octopus in each ball. Interior is super nice and clean. Menu is large, service was really really good. One of the better ramen places in the city. Apparently its the same chain that does the sushi and hibachi"}
{"text":"Amazing service and ramen.  We stopped eating meat and they offered me extra vegetables instead and they take gave us a lot of vegetables. Love it"}
{"text":"Okay okay... first things first... OX TAIL RAMEN. Once I saw it on the menu, I HAD TO GET IT. But instead, I decided on the Ohjah House Ramen---beef, chasu, AND ox tail. MEAT LOVERS HEAVEN. *drooooolz*

A problem with ox tail in most restaurants is the level of tenderness. Most times I've had ox tail at a sub par pho restaurant, the ox tail was difficult to eat, but Ohjah does it RIGHT. Literally fall off the bone, juicy and succulent. The broth is something you must have in this cold ass Vegas winter; definitely hits the spot! Another thing I enjoyed is the piece of bok choy that is included in the ramen, it was a perfect, refreshing, addition to the meal. 

One thing that did irk me a bit is the noodle to broth ratio. The amount of noodles and toppings were PERFECT, it was a lot more than what other ramen spots serve, but the bowl could stand a little more broth ¯\_(?)_/¯ 

BEST THING, (better than Jinya): SUPER SPACIOUS. A lot more seating to accommodate bigger parties, and a lot more lighting---it does your Yelp pictures justice. 

I seriously can't wait to sink my teeth in some ox tail ramen again!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I both ordered the oxtail ramen,  very bland no flavor and oxtail wasn't stewed long enough..  Fried rice was ok.. wasn't very busy and the server took too long to get our table.. won't be coming here again.."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new ramen place and a coworker suggested this place :) 
Right off the bat, the place has decent seating (comparing to Monta) and the service was good.
Got seated immediately for a Thursday night.

Ordered the Oxtail ramen and you can pick your own spice level and I went with the extra spicy....it had a nice kick, but bearable. Only complaint would be wanting more oxtail, but definitely would be back to try other things. For what you get and the cost overall, this place is worth it. Broth isn't too greasy and tons of topping options. 

Edamame is served on the house & they'll even give you free dessert with a Yelp review !"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Ramen spots. The broth is so flavorful, noodles are on point, every time we've come we have not been disappointed. My boyfriend and I went in shortly before they closed and they were so friendly and accommodating! We didn't want to keep them open to serve us, so we just ordered some takeout and they brought us a nice hot sake while we waited! Prices are good, quality is great! They get 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that the southwest has finally had a great uptick in solid Ramen/Pho restaurants. The wife and I frequent Ohjah Noodle house off Trop and Hualipai for their Teppanyaki, and are super glad they opened up a Ramen spot off Durango. 

Ohjah's TonKotsu broth is immensely flavorful and on point! (I'll be it a lil spicy than you might be used to) They have an amenity of solid, fresh, and well executed menu items. And I must say, between the decor and consistency of food, I was most impressed by their throughly attentive and hospitable service. Kudos Leo, Fegi and other staff-mates, you guys really make Ohjah what it is and well worth returning to time after time."}
{"text":"We decided to come here on this cold Las Vegas day! When you walk in the restaurant has an open floor plan and gives you a warm feeling! The decoration is beautiful and makes the place pop. 

We liked that the menu was nice and simple to read. We ordered the Oxtail super with Charsu and for our little one e has the base Raman with beef broth. The probs were great for us but a bit large for the kids portion. (Hey but who doesn't love eating left overs) we also ordered the house green tea and water. The soup had tons of meat and really well balanced. And my husband left ready to go to sleep full and happy. 

Great place and the service was exceptional I would definitely refer this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The service is always fast. I've only eaten at the grill but my kids absolutely love the entertaining chefs and the fire! The food is really well priced and it's delicious! The fried noodles and the filet are amazing."}
{"text":"Ohjah House special Ramen is my favor. Creamy white broth, full body flavor."}
{"text":"Wanted to check this place out because it's close to my house. We walked inside and it wasn't too busy, the ambiance and decor is very nice. I love the fact we did not have to wait! Excited to try this new place"}
{"text":"Food was decent but nothing overly special versus other places in town, biggest problem was the \"are you leaving yet\" attitude towards service when the place was almost empty."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Everything.  5 dollar appetizers and 8 dollar ramen with dollar or two add ons."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant. Great menu! The service is speedy. Can't wait to try the ramen!"}
{"text":"Nice warm ambience, it's very spacious and good for large groups. Oxtail ramen is what we tried. From previous post they have worked on cooking the oxtail longer and it came out very tender. Their broth was lacking flavor and the noodles that came with the oxtail ramen also not your typical ramen noodles, came out a bit over cooked and mushy. House fried rice was ok. Can't go wrong with fried oysters, nice and light panko batter. This place has potential."}
{"text":"A great local neighborhood Ramen  Restaurant. I met my girlfriend for some Ramen Soup after work. We started with some chicken wings accompanied with a sweet/mild spice dipping sauce. Then moved on to a Chicken Ramen (large pieces of chicken) and an Oxtail Soup  with extra ground pork. Finished off with Sake and Strawberry  Mochi. Yummy food and great service !"}
{"text":"As a noodle lover, I'm so glad Ohjah Noodle House opened nearby! 

Shoyu ramen was great, similar to Ramen Sora in my opinion. The house fried rice was delicious - flavorful with pork and imitation crab. My husband had the House Oxtail ramen and while the noodles and broth were good, he said the oxtail was just okay. It didn't have a lot of meat and lacked the \"cooked all day, fall off the bones\" texture that oxtail lovers enjoy. Shrimp skewers were a 7 out of 10, okay but not worth ordering again.

Service was friendly and quick. The restaurant is spacious, open, clean and inviting. Other ramen places tend to be small and cramped, so this was a nice change! 

Will definitely be adding this place to the rotation!"}
{"text":"Probably my new favorite ramen place! 

First of all the place is big!! Lots of booths and tables - unlike other ramen places where they have two tables and a few seats at the counter. No one will be bumping into each other!

Service was good. Quickly seated, offered water immediately, and orders taken as soon as we were ready. 

The house ramen with chasu, beef and oxtail! I love oxtail and when oxtail and ramen are combined... I am one happy girl!! The portion was perfect! Not too much noodles, not too much broth! Broth was perfect, not too salty or creamy, the meats were tender and flavorful! Really good ramen!! 

They ask if you want broth re-fill... never been asked that before!! We actually stumbled into this place because other places we wanted to try had a long wait and so glad we did! 

Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Comfort food! Savory broth, noodles cooked to perfection.  Had the Miso ramen with gyoza and fried oysters on the side  Oishi! Service was on point very accommodating and friendly!"}
{"text":"Even though I'm Asian, I really don't like to spend a whole lot of time in Chinatown, so I'm always on the lookout for good stuff minus all the crowds and lack of parking, and other mind-numbing things. 
So... I'm grateful that Ohjah decided to branch out from Teppanyaki to Noodles. I'm going to keep this one really brief. There is a wide variety of good food here from appetizers to beer.
I recommend adding some pepper oil to your meal unless you are really really against spice. I needed a few spoonfuls to make my ramen taste just right and I'm not a huge spice nut. They also provide you with garlic cloves upon request which added an extra depth of flavor for me. No extra charge. Everything we had was very delicious and pretty much on par with any other ramen joint you'll find around town. If you are there for the first time, the Ohjah House Special is a good choice. Very good.
While the food is good, there is nothing completely mind-blowing. And that's ok. Because to me, the real advantage that this place is that it can accommodate a lot more people than your average ramen joint in Las Vegas. There is plenty of table seating as well as counter seating and parking doesn't seem to be an issue here. That is a huge plus because I'm so over waiting for 45 minutes just to have a bowl of ramen. For this reason alone, I will be frequenting this joint much more. 
This place just opened recently so the staff seems like they are being over-cautious but they are friendly and warm. I'm actually looking forward to going down the list of food items like I usually do at places I like."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat, but if you are looking for Japanese Ramen, skip here and go to other Japanese owned ramen shop. We had Tonkotsu and Beef ramen, but I did not like the flavor of soup and the noodle was way overcooked. I think they make their oxtail ramen here at the restaurant and it was not bad, but it was more like other Asian noodle soup beside ramen. 
Great service, all waitresses are very nice and attentive. A good Asian restaurant but not a place for good ramen."}
{"text":"Excellent service each and every time. Plus the food is amazing! We tried this on a whim while my husband wasn't feeling good. The soup is so good! Reasonably priced and all the food tasted amazing! Definitely our new go to restaurant!"}
{"text":"A little less than 2 weeks ago I had noticed this place just opened up. And it's the second ramen joint to be within a 5 minute drive from my residence, which is a plus! Because sometimes I just don't feel like driving all the way to China Town, y'know?

Once you walk in, you immediately notice how spacious this place is. Compared to many of the other ramen restaurants in Vegas, which are tiny little spots. 

My roomie and I were seated right away at a table. The servers were attentive, prompt, and friendly. We ordered: the Ohjah Special ramen with oxtail, Tonkatsu ramen, shrimp skewers, and the house fried rice. 

My roomie loved the oxtail. She said it was juicy and fell right off the bone. She was also very impressed with the noodle to broth ratio. She said at some other ramen places there's either too many noodles or too much broth. And Ohjah nailed it with the noodle to broth ratio.

A server brought some spicy oil to our table. I added it to my Tonkatsu ramen and it made my dish taste much better (and this is coming from someone who usually stays away from spicy). The Tonkatsu broth was already flavorful prior to adding the spicy oil, however, it greatly enhanced my first time experience at Ohjah. The shrimp skewers were very tasty. The house fried rice was eh, nothing special. I probably won't order the house fried rice again.

At the end of our meal, a girl approached our table with a tablet to pay for our check. I'm still highly impressed with how technology works nowadays in regards to paying for meals at restaurants lol. Anyways, it was easy and simple. 

Will be back to try the oxtail!"}
{"text":"Glad to have quality ramen so close to the house! Everyone was nice and there was great, friendly environment."}
{"text":"Service was really great, for casual place, unexpectedly attentive. Food came out piping hot, broths tasty, very flavorful, good noodles. Had House Ramen, pork good, beef okay, but oxtail disappointment. They need to cook it longer so falls off the bone.

They have spicy option, but it's not really spicy. Add chili oil! The mushrooms were outstanding, would add more next time.

Chicken egg rolls were solid. One thing we didn't like - the takoyaki (fried octopus, breaded and served in medium size balls). Underfried so inside breading was mushy. We told them and they apologized and were quick to respond. Again, they treat you well!

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Not only the best ramen but always the best customer service!!  Would eat here everyday if i could."}
{"text":"new to the area and wanted to check it out.  Plenty of seating and very clean.  Team members very cordial.  Generous portions and great prices.  Will definitely go again.

{"text":"Super good!!! Our server was super nice and he gave us the best service. The veggie egg rolls were the best veggie egg rolls I ever had and the green tea cheesecake was milky and had a whipped butter texture consistency."}
{"text":"i recently wrote a review about ventanos italian restaurant. some how it ended up on ohjah noodle house. this was a mistake. please ignore my review. i have to say the owner of ohjah noodle house has contacted me to make things right. this sounds like a great business to me."}
{"text":"The broth is amazing! Got the beef ramen and the serving is plenty! Takoyaki and deep fried oyster was the bomb!"}
{"text":"I was driving by with a co-worker and decided to drop by for lunch. I was surprised that it was not busy during lunch time but wanted to try it out anyway. We had the garlic endame which was amazing. It was seasoned to perfection we almost order another one. The veggie egg rolls was nothing special. For my entree I order the oxtail noodle bowl and it was really good and serving was huge. My co worker looked up to see if there were any locations where he lived. Educated guess he will be coming back....lol I left very satisfied and the service was quick"}
{"text":"If you ever tasted ajisen ramen, then the taste is pretty much the same in this store. Not the best taste ever but not bad either."}
{"text":"We were on the business trip and passed by this brand new restaurant. Saw the good review and decided to give it a try. The restaurant is clean and has nice atmosphere. We all ordered ramens and takoyaki. They are good and delicious. Price is fair too. Will come back next time."}
{"text":"The food was overall good. My bf and i ordered the miso ramen and the ohjah ramen. One gyoza as an appetizer and a side of their house friedrice and the food very tasty. The ramen was perfect due to the hot steam coming out from the bowl. Everything are made fresh and servers were very helpful with us."}
{"text":"Another Ramen joint in Vegas! The perfect time of the year to get nice hot bowl of noodles. Talk about match made in heaven plus always enjoy checking out new restaurants around the valley. Guess Ohjah has a bunch of restaurants each one specializing in one style or food. I never been to any of the other ones. I was excited about checking out one of the newest ones. Ramen is one of my favorite foods. 

The menu is not much different then other Ramen places around town you pick your style broth and then spicy level. One item that stood out for me. Thankful yelp community checked out the pics noticed oxtail ramen. I was one of there house special ramen. The spicy level went mild since first time and had no idea level of hot. The medium or mild was nice subtle kick nothing major. The oxtail had mixed feelings. One piece with the bone that had hardly any meat and it was super tough. Then you had couple other pieces fall off the bone just the meat and was Sooo good. It was nice moist, juicy, and could have bowl of just oxtail. The broth has great depth and really good. The noodles was also delicious. The toppings you can add more but just went with whatever came with the dish. It always tradition for me go ramen style get some gyoza. It was very tasty. Overall solid Ramen spot. It definitely up in my top five but couple of the more stable Ramen spots better. The location literally almost in my backyard less then ten minutes away. I have no problem coming back for more then deal with long line of the more busy spots.

One thing need mention that Ohjah stands out, The size of the restaurant. We all associate Ramen spots or least for me. Not very big. Ohjah is literally twice the size then any other ramen spot around town. I only came for lunch so not sure the dinner crowd. I would find it hard see long waiting list like some of the smaller ramen spots around town. The service is nothing but five stars!!! My server was friendly, explain the menu being my first time, and always had smile on his face. Positive vibes. The decor inside feels more like restaurant restaurant  with the size lots of booths, tables, and not forget they do have ramen bar area that can watch the magic happen while you slurp down some noodles. I will be back...."}
{"text":"The chicken katsu is great, service was nice, I don't know what is there to not like about this place."}
{"text":"Tonight, me and my friend went to eat in this place for the first time. I ordered the Ohjah ramen with an extra side of corn and my friend ordered the Shoyu ramen. For appetizers, we ordered the takoyaki and the fried oysters. It was really good as for the oysters were very soft and not too hard compared to other places. The takoyaki was way better than some of the places that I went in the past. I was more amazed with the ramen. The flavor was very deep and not bland at all. The seasoning was just perfect. Same for the Shoyu ramen, my friend was deeply impressed as it wasn't at all salty compared to the other ramen places. We were thoroughly impressed with this place and would definitely come back again~"}
{"text":"A very small and cute place, open kitchen u can see how the chef make your order , very clean.
I been there couple times can not stop come back. 
I was there last night with my friends, we ordered couple appetizer wasabi octopus, garlic edamame , if u like hot sake, those two are very good when u have a drink.
We also tried the gyoza and chicken wings this time. Highly recommend the gyoza, it is pan fried pork dumplings with the dipping sauce , so awesome.
For the noodle, one of my friend like spicy, he ordered the tan tan ramen. We also order the Ohjah house ramen which one carry the oxtail , the tonkatsu  has chashu and soft boiled egg, so delicious.
Great service too, when I was sit front booth waiting for my friend, a sweet girl came check couple times help me the drink. During the dinner time, clean the dish we finished , refill our hot tea. 
I love this place, definitely will come again and try more."}
{"text":"I love Ohjah's Chicken Karaage, Fried oyster and takoyaki! Been craving for takoyaki in a while and Ohjah just satisfied my cravings! Super good! The ramen as well"}
{"text":"The noodles are fresh. I had the oxtail egg and noodle bowl it was delicious. The environment is nice and clean. I definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Ramen here was pretty good.  Service was really good.  I hope they do well.  I am a pretty big eater so I probably could have finished two bowls.  I like spicy food and needed two doses of the spicy sauce to meet my level.  I would go back.  Hoping they consider adding pork belly bowl to their appetizer menu."}
{"text":"Very clean super friendly waitstaff great appetizers I ordered the beef ramen the broth was more creamy then I wanted I should've went with the miso ramen add beef which the waiter said he would gladly do"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great interior at S. Durango, lots of space.  Choice of table or booth seating. 

No TV, which is a plus for us but not a big deal either way. 

Ohjah House ramen and Beef ramen hit the spot on this cold, foggy day.  Broth just right, Not salty or too dark like other places I've tried.  Second visit and ramen, service consistent. 

Leo is the best non-cook employee!"}
{"text":"My favorite ramen place to go to out in vegas, it's nice and quiet inside & the servers are very friendly and always check on me. They let you pick the spicy level to your soup as well. I recommend the chicken ramen!! Been here so much recently and I plan on it as long as I'm home before I head back to college!!"}
{"text":"The good: good amount of seating, quick service, and fair prices.

I got the tonkotsu ramen and my fiancé got the Tan tan men. My broth and chashu were tasty, but definitely the \"safe\" choice. My fiancé wasn't loving the broth for his tan tan men but it was still good nonetheless.

Not the best of the best in my opinion, but for no wait, unlike many of the other ramen places around, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff and delicious garlic edamame! And they have green tea cheesecake which was amazing."}
{"text":"Ohjah can always surprise me and it's a big surprise that they opened a ramen house..And I know that they won't let me down.It was absolutely good.I ordered the house special ramen with extra corns and eggs.The eggs cooked just right,meat as well.The best part was the soup,That soup has a brothy taste with a pleasant coating sensation over the tongue.Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ohjah Noodle House really doesn't disappoint! The service is very good, as always. I'm used to eating the sushi from Ohjah, but this noodle house is very creative and refreshing. The decor gives a very comforting environment. The prices were all very reasonable, and the chicken katsu I got was delicious! It's also in a very convenient location. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch and enjoyed some gyoza and ramen. I ordered the shrimp ramen with medium spice and chicken broth, plenty of toppings and turned out quite spicy. My friend had the pork ramen and thoroughly enjoyed it. Nice lunch spot, will be back again!

{"text":"I ordered the shoyu ramen and my husband had the ohjah ramen, it came with oxtail meat, both were good. Ramen didn't feel too heavy on the stomach but enough to fill you up. You need to try the fried oyster. Fried rice was ok, not something I'd order again. Staff are so polite also. Id definitely come back"}
{"text":"Second night in visiting Vegas and my friend wanted to go here since it was near his house. I was a bit hesitant because hey when I fly back home I can have ramen and 2 I'm not a big fan of Ramen in general, I rather have udon. Since he isn't coming back to Hawaii to visit for a while, I agreed to go.

We came here on a weekday and it was filled with a few people. I ordered the tan tan mien and got spicy. The server told me if it's not spicy he would bring me more spicy sauce. I was busy taking pictures and he came back to check on me. After I added the extra spicy sauce I liked it! My friend got the ohjiah house special ramen. He enjoyed his. 

We shared the takoyaki and fried oysters. They were pretty good. 

Let me say the service is very good. The guy was very nice and came back to check on us a few times."}
{"text":"Oil ramen. Yum. I think not.

My first sip of the Tan Tan ramen broth was essentially oil and a little bit of spice, and that sums up the dish. I tried to spoon off the oil, but my noodles were already coated at that point. There was no saving that dish.

Ohjah's broth was better, still slightly on the oiler side but bareable. I've had hearter broths at other places though.
Char was not as melt in your mouth as I expected. Flavorwise was lacking too.

Gyoza was gyoza. Nothing special. Sizing is proportional to pricing (5 small pieces.)

Takoyaki was fantastic.. Perfectly crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. The amount of bonito flakes they used makes me happy.

Service was great. The servers were attentive and friendly. Good prices for good portion sizes. 

There is a TON of competition around in terms of ramen, so with that said my hunt for good ramen continues."}
{"text":"Excellent service staff was very friendly. Food tasted great, very flavorful. Fast and very clean environment.  This is a Great new place !"}
{"text":"A NEW RAMEN PLACE JUST OPENED IN THE SOUTH SIDE!!!!!!!!!!
Everyone is always talking about Jinya, Monta,Kobo Noodle houses but they are always over packed, small with limited seating and overrated.
This place is large- at least 30 people can be seated comfortable and even more if they added more seating. 
We were immediately seated because they hadn't even had their soft opening yet and were still testing their menu and service.
LEO was our server and he was so nice and kept bowing at us (just like in Japanese culture)
Their menu is very simple and has about 5 ramen options
DEF DEF DEF wanna go with the OX Tail Ramen with the Tonkatsu broth
Other broths included Tan Tan, Shoyu, etc
The Broth was sooo rich and the noodles, with the big chunks of beef and oxtail, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and the slightly undercooked egg was one of the best dayum things I had ever eaten. We also tried the House fried rice (5.50$)- very large portion and still was delicious. 
+++the guava a dessert candy they give u at the end is LIT and super tasty
We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen spot to date. It's out of the way from home, but worth the drive for us. Plus my office just moved in the area, so that's a score!

I always use to avoid eating ramen since the restaurants around town are always tiny and crazy packed when the weather is cold or rainy. Waiting 30+ minutes is not worth it (Especially when I'm already hangry.) We use to frequent Jinya, but I started to notice that they screw you on toppings and broth. The price is steep for add-ons and they just don't hook it up like they use to. Thier service is lacking as well. They use to be my #1 spot when they opened a few years back and sadly they slowly went downhill from there. Props to their takoyaki though! 

OHJAH warmed up to me quickly (like a comforting bowl of ramen). Here's why:

1. We never have to wait for a table 
2. Attentive service & employees are eager to help
3. Food served shockingly quick
4. Quality ingredients with wholesome, flavorful & balanced broth (not too oily, salty or light)
5. Thick, perfectly meaty and fatty sliced chashu! Totally drool worthy! Order extra always! 
6. Prices are reasonable, it isn't $5 for 2 thinly sliced paper-thin chasu like every other ramen joint
7. Most importantly they do not skimp on the toppings or broth! I hope that never changes! 

*Recommendations: 
The takoyaki is great 4/5 
The tonkatsu is my favorite 5/5 
My toppings: chashu, menma (bamboo), scallion, soft boiled egg, corn, seaweed, wood ear mushrooms 5/5 

*Pro tip: Ask for these toppings on the side: black garlic oil & spicy chili paste. They add a nice kick to your ramen and it isn't overly spicy. It's just an extra $1 for the chili and $1 for the garlic oil, but definitely enough to split between two people! Add it to your broth to taste 5/5

*Secret menu: Garlic lover? Ask for the fresh garlic. They hand you a tool to crush the bulbs yourself, then blend the crushed garlic into your broth! Really packs a flavorful punch. We love it. 5/5"}
{"text":"My sister came to pick me up and told me we were going to Ohjah and I thought \"Oh! Yum!\" but had no idea we were coming to Ohjah NOODLE house. I was pleasantly surprised. The place has a cute ambience and pretty good, cheap ramen. The staff is also extremely attentive! Maybe my new ramen place up here!"}
{"text":"as a super raman fan, very glad they open this new place near my home. 
nice service and delicious food.
definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"We pass by this place all the time and finally we got to try it out. 

We were welcomed and sat immediately. The menu has a variety of items. We had the Gyoza, Fried Oysters and for our Entrees my daughter and I had the House Salmon.  All were delicious and were good portions.

With the Gyoza, you can either get it steamed or grilled (flat top/pan fried - I don't know how they do it, but we prefer the grilled).  It came with 5 pieces...

The fried Oysters had panko breading and were crispy, but not oily. I can't remember if it came with 4 or 5 pieces. 

All in all we will be back. We need to try their Ramen!"}
{"text":"Very nice and traditional ramen restaurant. Striking to see the correct condiments were at each table! Unlike other ramen restaurants where their too cheap or don't know or all about trends. (Like the restaurant just north of this one) And the price was right!! Been here 3 times and food was very consistent. .....Bravo!"}
{"text":"Just finished having lunch here & I was hoping for a lil more.  I had the tonkatsu ramen with garlic oil & the house fried rice.  Both tasted okay.  I like that they had different types of ramen that you could choose from and some side dishes also."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent Ohjah Hibachi, so I was excited when I heard they were opening a ramen joint. Unfortunately I wasn't too impressed by the food here. 

I ordered the miso ramen and it was not really anything special. The broth was OK, the noodles weren't great. Best thing about this place was the modern decor. 

Overall, I felt the ramen was mediocre and this is not the first place I'd go if I was craving ramen. There are many places that have more flavorful ramen in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wanted ramen for dinner and been passing by this place on the way home and wanted to give it a try. Couldn't get there till 9:45 and they close at 10pm and thought it was to late but as soon as we walked in we were greeted with friendly service and sat us with no complain that they were almost closing.. Ordered oxtail ramen, miso and beef and also had gyoza and fried oysters. Everything was delicious. Best ramen in the SW. Leo gave us great service and good food! So happy it's close to home and can get my ramen fix!"}
{"text":"The Best Ramen in Las Vegas. I have been searching for good ramen all over town by using Yelp as a guide, but Ohjah has topped my family's list. The amount you get is a little less than what you would get at Sora or other ramen joints, but the quality exceeds all. The employees are very friendly and very helpful. I personally like spicy ramen, but when I found that it wasn't spicy enough, they quickly brought out some chili oil to help increase the spice level. I will be coming here more often as it is the best ramen in town."}
{"text":"I have been here half a dozen times and am quickly becoming a regular. Their Beef ramen is delicious. Their service is impeccable and their prices are fair."}
{"text":"Great spot! Service was phenomenal! Tan Tan Ramen was great! Will for sure dine again! Super fast and great ambiance as well!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and efficient service. Wish they have more choices in the Ramen soup."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but it was just -eh okay. Ordered the tan tan men ramen and the boyfriend ordered the oxtail ramen. Both sounded delicious on the menu. We also started with some takoyaki of course. 

The decor, service, and over ambiance was really great and modern. The service was awesome, even though we came an hour before closing. 

Again, I really wanted to love this place. The tan tan men ramen was a ground pork ramen with all the usual fixings. I think the actual ramen noodles were  good quality, but the broth wasn't as sufficing. The oxtail broth was super plain that he had to add a ton of soy sauce and hot sauce to add flavor. At least the takoyaki was good. 

Sorry, but next time probably gonna drive the extra few miles to our favorite ramen spots on spring mountain."}
{"text":"Glad we found this awesome noodle restaurant during our trip to Vegas. The oxtail chasu Ramen is amazingly delicious. Even better is the reasonable prices, way more affordable than Ramen joints in LA.  The all wood decor theme gives the restaurant a rustic feel that goes well with the open kitchen layout.  Definitely a must do when in vegas!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the nicest ramen house around, interior-wise. There is plenty of seating and space to move around at your table.

We were happily greeted and seated right away. Our waitress was quick and friendly. She took our order when we were ready and the food came out quickly after.

My boyfriend ordered the Tan Tan Men Ramen, extra spicy and added corn, menma, and chashu. This was really, really good! The broth was so flavorful and the thick noodles were made perfectly. It wasn't exactly \"extra spicy\" though.

I ordered the Tonkotsu with corn and menma. Mmmmm, it was so delicious. The broth was amazing and full of so much flavor. Not too salty, not too thick. Temperature was perfect. Chashu was tender. I'm drooling just thinking about it. But, my one complaint is they don't have on their menu what kind of noodles come with the different broths/flavors. And, sadly, mine came with the thin noodles :( I just am obsessed with the thick noodles but didn't want to switch it or anything like that. So the thin noodles were ok but I would have preferred the thick! 

If I lived in this area, this would be my go-to Ramen spot!! But I live nearly a half hour away :( it was definitely worth the drive to try it out, though and I'll probably make the drive again to try the beef and oxtail ramens!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Best ramen in Vegas and comparable to the best places in LA as well.  Rich creamy flavorful broth with tender Ox tail and pork.  Nice ambiance.  Very happy to have found this place and the high Yelp reviewers really came through on this one."}
{"text":"Ohjah Noodle House was my friend's and my destination after a week long vacation on the Vegas strip. We needed something to give us fuel for our plane ride home and didn't want to be within a huge crowd, this place was the perfect spot for a quiet and calm meal. Not to mention the customer service was excellent. I especially loved how the employees were so friendly and kept that water coming. 

Once we got our food, it was clear to see that their kitchen crew knew how to make a mean bowl of ramen. My broth had so much flavor, and my favorite part, was that I could ask for whole garlic to crush fresh into my bowl. The killer of the entire meal though, had to be their fried rice. It tasted like a teppanyaki style fried rice straight from the flat top. After leaving this place the first time, it became my prime destination spot when I returned to Vegas."}
{"text":"So yummy !! Drop by here you won't regret it ! I ordered a ohjah house special ramen and it was delicious ! The soup was full of flavor and the thick ramen was on point. The house special ramen comes with beef shank , oxtail, chasu, green onion, boiled egg and wood ear. You can order different level of spiciness as well. Hubby ordered tan tan ramen and it didn't disappoint. The takoyaki was a bit skimpy on ingredients but was cooked just perfect. Fried oysters were good too. The staff was also attentive and the orders came fast. This will be a regular spot for us from now on !"}
{"text":"I just had their $6 chicken ramen lunch special when I planned on trying their house special. The deal was too good to pass up and it was soooo good. I added chili paste and menma to it, but quality and speed made me bump my rating up a star. I'll be back soon to try the house special"}
{"text":"Endless good things to say about the staff. I came in to place a to-go order and they were so sweet. Brought me a water and mints immediately when I sat to wait without asking and were overall just so friendly. Food was great too!"}
{"text":"Wow what an experience and not good.  We were sat at a Hibachi table and were told we were waiting for a few others. Twenty minutes later the other party showed up an immediately began complaining. Evidently we were put at a family birthday party. We had. no idea and it Never should have happened. We were then asked to leave because everyone was complaining. We were then told no other table available. We agreed to leave and then the profanity began! I kept my cool and vowed to never return.
 It was a  nightmare and management just stood by and watched.  I will never go back, well maybe after I learn the language so I can fend for myself. TERRIBLE"}
{"text":"I liked the Oxtail soup and the tako wasabi. The place is clean and well maintained. Servers are attentive :)"}
{"text":"My husband ordered the house special ramen with of tail and beef and it came quick. He had to ask for more broth though. I ordered the house special noodles and was very scrumptious. It had imitation crab so it was on the sweet side which I prefer but probably not a lot do. My serving was big for a single person. It's spacious, very clean and fast service."}
{"text":"Customer service 5 stars ! Our order was wrong and our waiter was quick to fix it and super nice about it. I got the tan tan men and it was good but the broth is a little too sweet for me, but still tasty. Make sure to ask for the chili sauce for the ramen if you're a fan of spicy food ! Overall, great experience and would come again :)"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, ok food, good vibes, friendly staff. Everything is pretty good beside the mediocre ramen"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to get my ramen fix here on a rainy Vegas afternoon. As we walked in, we were welcomed by two gentlemen who greeted us and sat us down immediately. Two great things so far. The host was nice and there was no wait. Their menu has great options. Our server came to take our order and of course I decided to try \"Ohjah Ramen\", which is there house ramen. It had oxtail in it and I absolutely love oxtail! It was delicious, a good portion, and filled me up. Good food, awesome service, cute interior as well! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I tried the House Ramen that is a donkotsu broth with chashu (2), oxtail (2), beef shank slices, mushrooms, 8 min egg, nori (2), bean sprouts, spinach, and plenty of goodness.

Japanese ramen is salty and fatty and that's what I love. This is none of those things. I realize fat is required for the broth to stick to the noodles. Just use the spoon. It works better. 

The broth is clean and milky. Cooking oxtail can render a ton of grease, but they took the time to skim it, leaving just the milky flavor to speak for itself. It's also not salty, just right. For the first time in a while, I left a ramen shop not feeling parched. 

The chashu had a nice roasted crust and pretty tender, but it knew it wasn't the star. It graciously let the oxtail be the main attraction. It was like Korean oxtail soup I get at my grandmother's. 

Everything was in balance, if anything, there was more meat than noodles. No complaints there. The noodles were al dente and stayed that way the whole time with good chew. 

I can't remember the last time I left a ramen shop feeling like I didn't pay with a few days of longevity."}
{"text":"Hmmm...good ramen but nothing stands out as spectacular.....So, I've been going to Monta Chaya on Eastern for a couple of years and when that joint closed,  God knows why, I'm still sad about this by the way...their ramen was to die for  and since then, I was in the hunt for another ramen restaurant 
that can equally match MC. I yelped other places and thought this place have good reviews.
I ordered take out and  got the Ohjah  ramen 
with a combination of beef, oxtail, Chashu 
in tonkotsu broth ( rich and milky broth from pork bones cooked for hours.) this broth is really amazing among all other broths. I personally think that if a good ramen joint is serving amazing tonkotsu broth, then I would think the miso and
Shoyo broths are equally spectacular. 
I got home and poured out the soup in a ceramic bowl. Well, I don't see the egg.  They all come with half a slice of egg. Oookay?!
So far, my tonkotsu broth is good and surprisingly not salty compared to most ramen restaurants.
...and that was a big plus, and a minus for no egg. 
Would I go back?  Yeah I would but I wouldn't consider it the best.
They have another restaurant in Henderson. 
The server told me that it's more Japanese food 
on the menu and no ramen except this location on Durango.
I don't know whether she's new or giving me incorrect info., but it looks like the other restaurant is serving ramen as well. 
Overall:  good ramen, not salty; amazing flavors?--nope.
Gave 4 stars: it's better than the other places I've been to after Monta Chaya closed."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because I have been here a few times now. 
I just wanted to mention my super nice servers Genie, Yenny, and Jing (I apologize if I spelled them incorrectly). These ladies seriously do their jobs well. 
I've had a good experience every time I came and the ramen is pretty good. There's always room unlike other ramen places and the orders come out very quickly. Also at the end of your meal, they give you a piece of candy. 
I also finally tried the takoyaki and it's super good. I don't think I'll be able come without ordering at least one plate. 
Overall, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Ohjah Ramen and it was really delicious. The oxtail was so tender and the broth is amazing. Server is very attentive and great place to dine. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place! The Ohjah house special ramen is delicious, and the mochi (served with whip cream) was also quite nice! The price was quite low, too- 56 dollars for four people!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is beautiful and the customer service is superb! Leo was super attentive and very helpful when selecting menu choices. I recommend trying the chicken egg rolls, it's really good!"}
{"text":"The service was great but the food wasn't that great. Had the tan tan men.... it said it was spicy... it wasn't spicy and bland broth. Got chasu pork and it looked like it would be delicious however we were severely disappointed.... it was dry and had a burnt taste to it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite ramen house. I am a frequently customer and I love their creamy broth. Servers are sweety and nice than the similar resturants. 

You shoukd try the house ramen with oxtail. It brings the flavor to the whole bowl. Definitely come back again."}
{"text":"When it comes to ramen noodle houses, or any establishment that specializes in making soup, I am very picky about how the broth is made. When a soup's broth is too oily or salty, I can't stand to eat it. However, this place had none of those problems.

My friend and I ordered the Tan Tan Men (Spicy) and the Ohjah House Ramen. We also ordered two appetizers: gyoza and squid skewers (All of these are in the photo collage). Everything tasted great and we had no complaints about the freshness or quality of the food.

My friend ordered the Tan Tan Men and said it wasn't as spicy as she thought it would be. It had more of a sweet taste. The condiments on the table that could be added to any dish, such as the chili powder, helped give it more heat and flavor. If you want to add chili paste (topping), it's a dollar extra. I added it to my order, but the quantity that they gave was more like ten cents worth! It was a really tiny, tiny scoop of chili. For someone who can handle a lot of heat in her food, I could have done without it. It eventually got lost in the broth. lol

Pricing is about the same compared to other ramen houses and the staff's service was not bad. Our server wasn't as friendly and seemed to be a lil annoyed, but everyone else who came around was really nice.

I don't think I would travel all the way down to this part of town just to eat ramen here, but if I'm in the area, I won't totally write this place off. All in all, it's a nice neighborhood noodle house with a simple menu."}
{"text":"Bomb ramen joint!!! Their customer service was exceptional! The food? Oh, so good! The broth was just phenomenal. I'm definitely coming back to this place."}
{"text":"The service is impeccable. Holly (our server) was so sweet and very generous. Holly took the time to go through the menu with me & also recommended a few items for me. There was an other server who was a gentleman who was very nice as well. The food was amazing but the service was the best part of the night. I highly recommend going."}
{"text":"Food was good ! Ordered the oxtail ramen .. appetizers, gyoza and the eggs rolls . Big portions . All for 40 dollars . For 2 people and beverages ."}
{"text":"Pro Tip: Be careful when ordering \"extra spicy,\" this place will definitely bring the heat!!

i really like this place.  This is my go-to ramen spot in Las Vegas!!  The staff is very friendly and very helpful.  Always greeted with a smile when you walk in.  The different types of ramen come with either a chicken broth or a pork broth.  You can always request the broth you prefer and they will make your ramen with that broth at no extra cost.  I've had the tan tan, ohjah special, but my usual is the miso ramen.  Depending on how hungry I am, I may get extra noodles.  The nice thing is... if you need more broth, just ask and they will bring out a small bowl for you.  Also, if you ordered the pork broth and wanted to taste the chicken broth, they will gladly bring out a small bowl for you to taste.  

Besides the ramen, I have had the gyoza, takoyaki, house fried rice, garlic edamame, chicken wings, and chicken egg rolls.  Of all the appetizers, I'd have to say the fried rice and garlic edamame were my favorites.  I just can't get enough of their spicy chili sauce they make in-house.  So good and so spicy!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Very friendly staff with quick service! The Ohjah House Ramen is the best! The broth is perfect, not too salty. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love the other Ohjah locations for their sushi and was so excited to hear they opened a noodle house down the road from my office!
I came in here around 4 pm on a Tuesday and it was practically empty. I was immediately greeted and put in my drink order (large sake, which was only $4.95!). 
I ordered the Tan Tan Men because it was spicy, and it was out within five minutes. It was in the largest bowl I think I've ever seen! I was only able to eat about half, but they put it in a container to go for me. 
It was very fairly priced, after tip my total came out to $20. I'll definitely have to eat my way through this menu one bowl at a time!"}
{"text":"I have had many types of Ramen and this is my favorite by far! This place has a very pleasant and welcoming staff. I could not recommend it more! Go eat here !!"}
{"text":"Great new place. Shrimp skewers and tan tan men were super good. Great variety of ramen."}
{"text":"The staff greeted me instantly upon entering. I've never had Japanese food before, so she recommended a few different dishes. I had the chicken katsu and it was really tasty, cooked perfectly. The garlic edamame is a must have! I'll come back soon and try the ramen. Overall my first experience was great and I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"The service is amazing. They great you traditionally and are extremely attentive to you. Along with the super sweet staff the food is amazing and absolutely delicious. The noodles are nice and tender and the broth was really tasty (I personally recommend the shoyu ramen). I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Best place for ramen for me so far in vegas... if you love ramen a must visit. I recommend their oxtail ramen =)"}
{"text":"We decided to try a new place by the house because we got a mailer with a coupon and it was so amazing!!  Our waiter was so helpful and always smiling. 

We had the takoyaki and garlic edemame for appetizers and they were both very good.  There was a perfect amount of garlic on the edemame and we had never had takoyaki before so we decided to give it a try.  It was a bit too mushy in the middle for me but the overall flavor was very good.

For our entrees we had the oxtail ramen and the house ramen.  There was oxtail in both and the flavor of the meat was just flat out amazing.  I've had oxtail at other places before but it has never been so flavorful and tender.  

We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Ohjah and all their restaurant ventures never disappoint.  Service is always the key part about what makes Ohjah great.  The waiters are very friendly and attentive and will really make your meal as pleasurable as possible.  

I ordered the tonkatsu - extra spicy.  The waiter even gave me my own bowl of chili oil and paste to spice up the broth to a whole other level if I chose.  The broth was good and noodles were fine.  Spice level was above average but not too bad.  Noodles could have been thicker but still tasty.  The chasu was melt in your mouth.  The best part about the meal was the chasu while the rest of the dish was just a very good bowl of ramen.

Total cost was about $10 which is a normal cost for ramen in Vegas.  I really hope they open another Noodle House location in Summerlin because I hate having to drive all the way south or to China Town to get a quality bowl of ramen.  But if I'm in the area, Ohjah would be a nice eating spot no doubt."}
{"text":"Tried their tantan ramen for dinner over the weekend. The ramen tasted good. The noodles were cooked nicely and the broth (chicken based for tantan ramen) wasn't overly salty. My friend had their shrimp tempura ramen and she enjoyed it as well.

For the price, i think the portion is decent and it is filling to me. I think they could've given more toppings though (they gave a stingy one sheet of nori for the ramen). Their service was great. The waiter came by several times throughout our dinner and checked to see if everything was ok and if we needed anything else. 

However, they forgot to put egg in my ramen (see picture) and I didn't realize it until after I left. I had thought something was missing from my ramen, but I was too busy chatting with my friend and couldn't figure what was missing until after I got home LOL. For this lack attention to detail, I took off one star. 

The ramen I tried was good enough for me to want to come back and try other items on their menu. Do I think this is a 5 star ramen place? Nope. If you're looking for that in Vegas, try Fukumimi (tastier ramen that came with more toppings for a cheaper price). However, in my opinion, this place is better than Ramen Kobo just down the road and I don't have to drive over 30 minutes to get to it."}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my favorite spots as a Vegan newbie! My go to selections have been garlic edamame, seaweed salad & Vegetable Miso Ramen. Just delicious! I actually crave the seaweed salad! The service is always accommodating & friendly. This has now become a weekly dinner spot for me!"}
{"text":"This place is really great! They do have outstanding service compared to many of the ramen places I've gone to. 

Lets get down to the food. We ordered an oxtail ramen and got a few appetizers. Got the takoyaki, edamame, and takowasabi.

I wasn't feeling up for ramen. Ramen usually kills me and gives me heartburn because of all that heavy feeling it leaves behind. I decided to share with my other half and the broth is great! 

The broth was not salty and it had enough flavor in it, didn't give me heartburn either haha. It was delicious! It had about two pieces of oxtail in it. I want to come back again to try the other ramen. 

The takoyaki was VERY good! The taste was very traditional and had that crispy outside. Takowasabi was normal, I mean how hard is it to go wrong with this? The portion was a bit larger than I expected though but not a bad thing! At last, I don't want to review the edamame because I think it all tastes the same but I was just craving it so decided to order it."}
{"text":"I was craving a soup based dish when I found this place. I'm so glad I went here for lunch because I left the place satisfied. I wanted to order every single appetizer they had, but I only ended up getting takoyaki which was amazing. I asked for a side of chili sauce because I love adding a bit of heat to my dishes. I got the Shoyu ramen without the meat & egg, and my boyfriend got the Tan Tan Men. The broth for my ramen was refreshing while my boyfriends was spicy. Also, the noodles were thin which made everything 10x better since I'm a fan of thin noodles. The service was amazing and the interior was clean and had an urban feel to it. I know I'll be going here again."}
{"text":"Ohjah never fails to amaze me, even when it comes to ramen. I used the coupon for a free appetizer with a purchase of $20 or more, and it was perfect because I had a table for two. I got the Special Ohjah House Ramen, which came with the option of either chicken broth or tonkatsu broth. I chose the tonkatsu broth because I liked the creamier brother. My friend ordered a shoyu ramen. For the appetizer, we ordered a takoyaki, which I heard good things about. The food came promptly and at the same time. The takoyaki was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside; the tako had the perfect texture. The special Ohjah House Ramen broth was at a nice consistency, and the flavor was amazing. The beef was tender and practically melted in my mouth. The noodles were also cooked perfectly. The Shoyu Ramen also had flavorful broth and well-cooked ingredients. Overall, Ohjah Noodle House does not disappoint. It is easily one of my favorite ramen places in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The ramen here is so bomb!!!! The service is incredible as well.   Very quick and attentive! I'm a vegetarian so they helped me create a ramen that was suitable for me! I also had the veggie eggrolls that are simple but very good! Plus this is down the street from my house so it's going to make coming back real easy!"}
{"text":"I ordered the house noodle which I couldn't figure out what taste was it going for. Doesn't taste like yakisoba. But the ramen was good!!"}
{"text":"lazy to cook, went to my favorite noodle house ohjah again,ordered tantan ramen and miso ramen with extra oxtails.  Outstanding service from the wait staff and the manager. Very attentive to our need, especially to our toddler. Highly recommend ramen to warm your tummy!"}
{"text":"This is the second ramen house in my neighborhood. I'm so happy that I have a choice.

I actually visited this location on a Saturday following their soft opening on a Thursday. So the restaurant was empty. They used this time to get the staff trained and work out any kinks. So it was really nice to hear the supervisor asking our opinion on how to better their services and soups. Honestly, although the new waitress was a little all over the place due to her too many \"supervisors\", she did great. There wasn't much I could contribute. However, I did think that the free cookies n cream mochi ice cream was a great addition. It nicely cleaned my palate after having ramen. Very refreshing.

So I was surprised on my second visit, with my family, that the menu looked totally different. It definitely was not a bad thing. The menu appears to be a copy of their take out menu. The one thing I do have to complain about is the font size for the ramen content. My vision isn't as sharp as it used to be so, so reading small teeny tiny font was a problem. But the servers are very helpful, so they didn't seem to mind having to read the content for me.

Although there is a ramen house in the next plaza, there are a few reasons why I like this place better:

1. Price: At least for the tonkatsu ramen, the basic content includes seaweed and egg for $8.95. The other ramen house, tonkatsu ramen is the same price, but you have to add seaweed and egg costing you about $11.

2. Restaurant size: both restaurants have great atmosphere. However, Ohjah is larger that they could actually fit more tables. As for the other ramen house, I believe it can only seat 16 at tables and 8 at the bar.

There is one thing that I believe the other ramen house has over Ohjah and that is the other restaurant's soup is a little more flavorful, but not by much. 

Now as for the mochi ice cream, it isn't on the new menu, but hopefully they will add it in the future during the summer.

On my second visit, my niece and her husband were visiting us from the Arcadia/Monrovia/Azusa part of SoCal. These towns are known for their Asian restaurants and really good and cost savings. So I was a little worried as to what they would think. But they had nothing but good things to say. My nephew had the Ohjah House ramen was an oxtail ramen and included everything at a good price of $12.95. He looked very happy and content with the little beads of sweat coming down his forehead from making his own ramen extra spicy.

If my husband would let me, I would be at Ohjat on a daily basis :D

5-stars for Ohjah Noodle House!"}
{"text":"Amazing and tasty ramen along with excellent customer service!! Thanks to the Manager Leo, who has always been so much helpful! Must-try place !!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen and very friendly servers. It's very spacey so I'm sure no one would have to be on the wait list like most ramen restaurants in Vegas offer. I love it!"}
{"text":"This place was ok...Had the fried oysters & house fried noodles.. Prices are reasonable & great service!"}
{"text":"The place is so clean and nice! The workers there are also extremely warm and welcoming! They were there before I even need anything! I got extra napkins, refills, got asked if I need extra noodles or broth, etc! They give off such a pleasant, positive vibe! 

Their noodles are so yummy! I got the tonkotsu ramen and my boyfriend got the spicy shoyu! We've been to COUNTLESS ramen bars all over vegas and California and this is really good ramen! We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, it's close to my house and the ramen is oh so yummy. The staff is pleasant it's a nice clean establishment. I definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood for top quality ramen."}
{"text":"1st time having ramen. My boyfriend and I both got the Ohjah ramen. It was flavorful and filling. Service here is   great. Everyone is very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I really can't suggest any fresh ideas to this perfect noodle house experience. I wanted to take the entire wait staff home to party and the food was excellent. My wife and I live right around the corner so we plan on visiting often. Do yourself a good thing and come, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious ramen. Ordered the tonkatsu, noodles were just right, I'll probably order spicier next time though, I ordered the medium but wasn't really spicy."}
{"text":"Bomb ramen. New place in the neighborhood and it looks awesome. Definitely coming again!"}
{"text":"Food is great and awesome customer service! Will be back for sure. We tried the ohjah ramen special, oxtail ramen and shoyu ramen all in pork broth."}
{"text":"The ramen here is very tasty. I've tried their tonkatsu and their oxtail ramen. The meat in the oxtail ramen is very tender and flavorful. The best thing about this restaurant is their service. One server in particular, has very good manners, stands at your eye level when taking orders, and always knows when to refill our water or teas. The only downside of this restaurant is the quantity of the appetizers. The chicken wings dont have a lot of meat. In comparison to other ramen shops, I would rate this place top second in vegas for its shorter wait times and good location, but lacking on the noodle quality like monta. This is coming from someone who eats ramen in other countries and have tried all the ramen places in vegas. If youre in the area, this place is 100% better than kobo."}
{"text":"Went to ohjah for some ramen and some apps . I'm not a ramen pro but I know about flavors and the sides . I had the tonkatsu ramen which was ok. i probably won't be back because of the other options in town.Ive since been to JINYA which was way better and has more small plate items."}
{"text":"I just tried the oxtail ramen, fried rice, and appetizers. pure, smooth taste with no grease. Awesome!!! This will be my go-to ramen & steak place."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Service was even better. They were kind and explained their items greatly. They have food fit for all types of tastebuds."}
{"text":"I've been to almost all ramen place in Vegas, I like Ohjah noodle house the best.  
I'd prefer thick curly noodle over thin straight noodle.
Soup is flavorful."}
{"text":"Went to OH JAH Noodle House in southwest Vegas again.  They have an oxtail ramen (I know amazing right?) that is delicious!  This new restaurant's ramen is not too fatty or salty (like a lot of ramen places here) and the waiter there bows so low and smiles so big!"}
{"text":"This place takes the ramen! Rarely would I pay $10 for a bowl of soup. But damn... I can't stop here. Sooooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Your standard run of the mill ramen house. It tastes good if you like shoyu broth. Personally I'm more used to tonkotsu. 

Good but nothing phenomenal."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this restaurant on our way to the airport and I didn't expect much out of it but I was wrong. The noodles were rich, creamy and the meat is tender. My family all loved it. Customer service and environment is also great. We will definitely come back for more when we come through here again."}
{"text":"Best Ramen place in the area! Flavor is always on point. My girl and I have slowly made this our regular spot at least once a week. Mellow environment and excellent service. Perfect for a family night or date night! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Philthy reViews....A cozy little ramen spot in Henderson

Should you go?  This place is one of those \"Yeah I'll be back\" type spots that make it to your restaurant rotation list.  The food is good and the service is quick.   All the hallmarks of a good food spot.

Chashu Bowl: ($4) It's basically an off menu item.  I just combined sides of chashu over a bowl of white rice.  

Ohjah Ramen: ($11.50)  From those who ordered it, they thoroughly enjoyed it.  It smelled delicious but as I did not eat it personally I can only speculate.  

Chicken Wings:  Delectably crunchy with a little kick to it.  It did the job. 

Price: Average for a ramen house.  

Service: Quick and excellent."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite ramen spot in the Southwest area. 

It's not like all the other ramen spots where there's only like 4 tables, crammed seating space and long wait times. Ohjah is actually very spacious and I've never had to wait to be seated. They also have a variety of appetizers and dishes other than ramen. 

My go-to lately has been the Ohjah Ramen with chicken broth. If you love lots of meat I highly recommend this one. You get a nice big piece of oxtail, two chashu pork slices and beef slices. Also comes with two pieces of nori and one marinated soy sauce egg. The broth is so flavorful and the ramen noodles are cooked perfectly. There's plenty of meat and noodles that I can never finish it in one sitting. 

Service is pretty good too, the workers are friendly and attentive. My friend left his debit card and didn't realize it til later in the day and decided he would pick it up the next day. When he called the worker was really nice about it and told him he can come before opening hours and they would have it for him in morning. 

Definitely recommend this place if you want some quality ramen."}
{"text":"This place had some of the most filling an satisfying and delicious ramen ever.  We got the vegetable spring rolls, which were good, but nothing extraordinary. However, the house ramen, which is their speciality, was very filling, and had all of the meats available, along with the wood fungus, which is better than it sounds, and a delicious broth. Overall, I was very impressed. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I loved this place ! Super friendly staff :) 
Bigger menu than Kobe ramen ( that's like a block a way ) 
I had steamed gyoza and the Tan tan ramen ( ground pork) Everything was delicious! They also serve beer !"}
{"text":"Came here after reading all good reviews and was kinda disappointed. My son and wife had ohjah house special and tan tan ramen while I had oxtail ramen. All 3 were bland so we had to add some soy sauce just to get some flavor. Takoyaki was really good and service was excellent. Our server was attentive and super nice. If I do give this place another shot to try something else on the menu it'll probably be because of the service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen place in Vegas! Anytime I feel an ounce of sickness, I order from here, and it's like a magic cure, I swear! My favorite is the tonkotsu ramen, extra spicy. The takoyaki is so good too.  My only tip is don't order the mochi to go in Vegas unless you plan on eating it in the car"}
{"text":"Pretty solid ramen place. Something ohjah offers that I haven't seen at other ramen restaurants is oxtail ramen. Yes, ladies and gents you read that correctly OXTAIL! Their oxtail ramen pretty much sets them apart from other places. 

My boyfriend and I both got the Ohjah Noodle house. It was pretty good with the oxtail, but the broth wasn't anything too special. Usually it's the broth that makes me want more, but it was pretty average. I wavered between 3 or 4 stars. It would have been 4 if I loved the broth. They do add a whole chasu egg which was a plus. Some places give you half an egg and others don't add the egg at all! 

Service was polite. Our waiters gets his own star because of how nice he was. He was attentive but not so attentive that he kind of disrupted the meal he kept the water flowing and sometimes that's all a customer needs!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Ohjah! I work right up the street and my coworkers and I seem to come and visit this location at least once a week. The staff is amazing and the food is delicious. I usually order the tonkotsu and add some spice to it. Even though it's over a hundred degrees outside I still find myself craving their ramen daily, haha. I absolutely recommend this place, especially for lunch. It's not usually super busy so you'll get your food fresh and fast. I will definitely be back and I'll branch out and try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing, a little off of my gf and I's beaten path, but well definitely come back any chance we get! Food was delish!!"}
{"text":"Ohjah noodle house just opened a few weeks ago. It's a nice place and very clean. The staffs are very friendly. I tried the seafood ramen. The broth is very tasty. It's very good noodle with good amount of seafood and vegetables. I got takoyaki and gyoza as appetizers. I'll definitely come back again and try other ramen. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family for the first time and our experience was fantastic with great tasting ramen. Our server Siena was very personable and sweet. Will definitely come back for more, THANKS!"}
{"text":"Quite a pleasant experience!  Spent time with some family here for an early dinner.  The place was not too crowded at the time.

The service was very helpful and order was prepared at an expedited rate, faster than most.  I ordered the Tan Tan Men, a ramen dish with some spiciness.  This was a delicious dish, and I can't wait to try a new dish!"}
{"text":"Services is amazing treat you like family realy good ramen and more important Sapporo is always ice cold. Stop by almost everyday after workout is a good and healthy option food."}
{"text":"Seven of us gathered here on a Saturday morning (late) for trying different things on the menu and the ramen.  Items ordered that I tried:

Seaweed salad
Takoyaki
Tako wasabi
Karaage
Sliced dried beef
Gyoza dumplings
Tonkotsu ramen with extra egg

Two things from the appetizer list that stood out for me were the seaweed salad and the tako wasabi.  Although seaweed is pretty much the same from one Japanese restaurant to another, this presentation and dressing were first rate.  Teh tako wasabi was also very good.  I enjoyed the takoyaki but I only have one other place to compare this with and it stood the comparison well.

The ramen was a normal sized portion.  The noodles for the tonkotsu are thin and are house made.  The broth was rich and the ramen is good.

Service was excellent with items brought out in separate stops rather than many things at once.  

It's good to have a ramen house of this quality without going to somewhere on Spring Mountain Road.  It's a quick trip on the freeway for me to get here."}
{"text":"Excellent meal! Service was great - friendly, attentive and informant! Fresh and delicious. Garlic Edamame was a ten! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Delicious Ramen!

Randomly found this place while searching for places to dine outside of Las Vegas. Dining on the Strip tend to be costly since 85% of the people that go there are tourists, 10% of the people probably work there and maybe some 5% are locals that party there. That is my non-scientific prediction. LoL!

Still in Las Vegas it is about 11 miles from where we were staying at the Hard Rock Cafe on Paradise Rd. No crowds, although, I heard this place does get crowded. Had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered the Miso Ramen (bean sprouts for crunch, scallions for flavor, soy-cured egg half with a bouncy firmness, seaweed, wood fungus [kikurage], fish cake, chashu and ground pork topped with a square of nori on the side). So good and yummy!  Hubby enjoyed his Beef Ramen, who likes it hot and spicy, while our teen ordered her favorite shrimp tempura. 

The inside is spacious and the tables were spaced out nicely (compared to our local Ramen House Ryujin in Sacramento). The interior decor is nice and modern with Asian flair. Very clean. The service was fast. We got our food in fairly good time. The servers were friendly and attentive to our table. It was a nice treat to be able to dine here. We will certainly come back again on our next Vegas visit! The restaurant is located on the corner of a shopping plaza with plenty of parking.

Review #0905"}
{"text":"We mistakenly tried to go out to dinner without reservations tonight. We love Ohjah, so we were excited when their new noodle house had seating. It did not disappoint! Food is every bit as good as their steakhouse. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good ramen place. The restaurant is very pretty and spacious.  The service was very good and quick.
The ramen was good but maybe a little inferior of my favorite ramen place in town."}
{"text":"Good ramen! Service is great. Everything came out super fast. Supes, totes, perf food."}
{"text":"Started at Ohjah Noodle House 2 now we here. =) I had high expectations because House #2  in Henderson was great...

Service:  We were seated immediately, ordered and the food came out quickly and with a smile.  Drinks were kept fresh and management stopped by to check on us.  Nearly identical great service that I experienced at Ohjah House #2.

Ramen & Non-Ramen:  Was feeling hungry so I went with the heavy Ohjah Ramen and resquested extra spicy: Oxtail, Beef, Chashu, Egg, Bean Sprouts, Scallion, Seaweed, Wood Fungus, & spinach.  The broth was great and not really spicey in my opinion, I gauge that by how much I sweat.  I didn't sweat much but it was still tasty and the noodles were yum.  The yaki Gyoza and fried oysters were good if you're fiending them.  The Kimcho fried rice was my favorite Non-Ramen dish, definitely ordering again.

Ambiance: Again, nearly identical to Ohjah House #2 with lots of wooden tables, walls and benches to give me that Ramen House feel I had when I visited Tokyo.  Lots of booths, tables, and a Ramen Bar to seat parties quickly.  Most good Ramen joints are notoriously associated with a lack of seating and long waits.  I'm so glad that Ohjah doesn't have that problem at either location and which is why they get the 5th star.

The OG Ohjah Noodle House set the precedence for House #2 and they're both fantastic noodle houses on opposite sides of the valley.  If you're in the area and are fiending Ramen, the OG Ohjah Noodle House and the 2nd house is the place to be.  Enjoy yourself.."}
{"text":"Fried rice
Chicken wings
Good.
Good.
And the service

Cody was very patient with my indecisions on what to get and my gf and I were majorly hungry. Almost hangry. Hahaa. He always checked up on us, even grabbed extra napkins before we needed to ask. Made the delicious food just that much better and always did it with a smile"}
{"text":"I got beef ramen pretty big blow we shear for 2 people and I got house fried rice (5.75$) I'm so full #nice music #good food"}
{"text":"I have twin toddlers so I choose sleep over writing reviews but just had to post about the excellent food and service here.  The ramen (we ordered Ohjah ramen with pork broth) was superb.  The broth was rich without being too salty, and the assortment and portion of meats and toppings made it a great value in my opinion.  I have never had oxtail in my ramen before, and it was perfect - tender, melt-in-the-mouth good.  We also ordered a number of small plates, and each one tasted as good as it was artfully presented.  Of note, the garlic edamame wasn't your typical edamame tossed with some fried garlic.  The sauce was just to die for!  

The staff was super attentive and kind even though we brought kids to the restaurant against our better judgment.  Our picky kids loved it and were entertained by the staff who were so much fun (there was dancing and ice cream involved).  

I am tired of ramen places with super tiny seating areas where you can't even try to bring kids, not to mention the long waits.  The food here is every bit as good or better as those other crazy crowded ramen bars, and the service absolutely can't be beat.  WIN.  My family will be frequenting this joint exclusively from now on."}
{"text":"Very comforting and welcoming place to eat. Awesome food, awesome service and they play edm too ! Highly recommend coming here on a lazy day"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! This place has amazing FRESH ramen. Then people here are super nice and accommodating. The atmosphere is nice and clean with beautiful decor. Prices are reasonable for the amount you get. Will defiantly be back again!!"}
{"text":"The best middle house ever! My kids love to go there. Miso Ramen is a bomb. Moreover, people who work there are very kind and warmhearted. Magnificent!"}
{"text":"I got the Tan Tan ramen (if you like it spicy I would ask for a higher spice level because it's not spicy as is) and it was full of flavor and a good portion too! The interior is really nice, great customer service- would come again!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The service is outstanding. My friends and I have eaten here twice so far and have zero complaints. Walking into the place they make you feel so welcomed, they really know how to make sure water and drinks are always full. You never have to ask for anything they're always there before you need anything. The Ramen is very flavorful. My daughter really likes the chicken wings. She devours those. This place is really close to my house which is nice cause the other Ramen place I like is in China town its nice to have a place in the neighborhood thats really good. The prices are reasonable, the service is amazing, its clean, and the food is really good. We will be definitely making more trips here."}
{"text":"I have to preface this rating with me being a bit jaded. 

This place is pretty good. Came here around 6:30pm on a Friday night and when I walked in, I was seated within seconds. The place wasn't busy at all which is weird for a Friday night in this area. The decor is really nice, and the staff is attentive. 

I ordered the Ohjah house ramen and a side of gyoza. The house ramen comes with some oxtail, some chashu pork, and all the other standard ramen stuff in (I think) a tonkatsu broth. I asked for a medium level spicy. 

The broth came out warm but not really hot. The spice was more of a pepper type spice instead of a chili type. It wasn't spicy at all, just heavily peppered. Since the broth wasn't that hot, none of the fat on the oxtail really cooked making it mostly not edible. The noodles were good, but nothing special. The gyoza were pretty decent, but the sauce that came with them was bland.

The reason I feel jaded is because there's a ramen place walking distance that's so much better. Overall, I'm undecided if I'd come back. If you want ramen, and don't want to wait an hour at the place next door, then this place is probably ok. It will suffice for a ramen craving."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everyone is so friendly and the food is great. Lindsey is the best!! Thanks so much for a great experience."}
{"text":"I liked it but I'm not in love with it. It's a place that has some good options but it's not something that I would want all the time. The ox tail was a bit tough to eat and the broth was a little bland although it looked creamy. I would definitely try and go back at a later point in time and try a different dish if the outcome was different. The noodles reminded me of actual top ramen noodles. 
Also, they didn't pick up their phone when we tried calling for take out so we had to go in and order. I'm sure the phone issue has been resolved since then as this was a few weeks ago. Overall I'm glad we have more options in the southwest for some noodles because there can never be enough noodles in ones life. Definitely an option to try if you've never been here because you may like it despite my opinion. =)"}
{"text":"This place has friendly staff, great authentic noodles, and a modern feel. Best place for noodles :-D"}
{"text":"Our second time visiting today and we enjoyed it just as much as we did the first one we visited!

I ordered the Tonkatsu with thick noodles. I am not a fan of thin noodles so I asked for it and it was perfect! Pair it with a green tea iced tea, yum!

Servers are always great. Very friendly and always check to make sure you're happy with your meal."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to eat here, but a friend wanted to try it badly. The miso ramen taste was underwhelming for me. Granted, I did make it the highest spice level and that usually destroys the miso. It was a strategic move on my part, since my expectations were very low. 

The takoyaki was shockingly amazing. It almost reminded me of a very good version that I had in Osaka. Nicely done!!! I liked the crips exterior, and the inside was cooked just right. 

The pan-fried noodles weren't quite the yakisoba that I was hoping for, and it was okay.
Service was top-notch, and I love the decor. The servers were all nice and friendly,"}
{"text":"Yo u gotta get the Takoyaki. It's so bomb. It looks very nice too for a casual date night. And the service is great!  They have a lot of options other than Ramen. I didn't try the ramen yet because I wasn't feeling like it but I will definitely try it next time!"}
{"text":"This place was quite surprising. The decor is simple but pleasant as is the menu. The prices were good. I paid $10 for a beef Ramon bowl with mushrooms, spinach, but I didn't get egg. You have to get it with garlic oil - the flavor is tremendous and I also get it spicy but be prepared it was really spicy. I ended up having to scoop some of the chilis out. It's a nice comfort food option."}
{"text":"Ramen nearby and no wait?  Oh hell yeah!  Ohjah!

One time... in band camp...  my wife and I tried many ramen joints in search of a local favorite. All were too salty or wait times were exceedingly brutal. We came to our senses when we figured one does not go to Vegas for ramen. Duh!

Monkey do:

TONKOTSU RAMEN w/thick noodle- where some say underwhelming, Monkey thankful it not so salty. 

At $9, it's a decent bowl of ramen, though it'd be perfect if it came with a third slice of chashu, corn, more bean sprouts and another seaweed. $5 more would be absurd. 

Monkey returned for:

OHJAH HOUSE RAMEN-  2 each of oxtail, beef, chashu, egg, seaweed  $11.50. Okay happy now. 

Clean, spacious and friendly, Monkey will definitely return.  Hot or cold days and no wait?  Count on It."}
{"text":"I love me some ramen but this was just boring. Nothing special at all. Just noodles. Just soup. Just the traditional topping. No wow factor in taste or presentation. I can't eat it was bad, but not good either. The \"pork rice\" was absolutely terrible. Tasted like cardboard over a sad example of any type of rice. There isn't another spot for ramen close To my house so I can't say i won't be back - but definitely not my first or third choice for lunch."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's just easier to keep reviews simple, because I could otherwise go on and on about this place. 
The food and service was amazing, the taste of everything ordered was just too good. Garlic Edamame is a must! wish I could give them more than 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place has really fast service and really delicious ramen. We tried the tonkastu ramen and the beef ramen. The broth is on the lighter side but still flavorful. We also tried the Takoyaki which were light, fluffy yet full of octopus flavor. I loved the amount of mayo and toppings on it just perfect to match the batter. Even their green tea is very flavorful would recommend as a quick lunch or dinner place with a decent prices for the ramen."}
{"text":"Had oxtail & tonkatsu ramen. Both are delicious. Persoanlly I prefer oxtail more, for its delicious light soup base. Offers excellent values too, all ramen are under $10 with large portion with toppings!

Service is also excellent- meaning they have the sense of what customer needs- with kids, they will bring out kids bowl, plastic utensil, extra napkins. And continuous checking if the food is ok and if you need anything else. 

That is good enough for me to earn 5 stars for a Ramen noodle house."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, great food and pretty fair prices! I come at least once a month. I do think they can use a little bit more \"privacy\" I don't like sitting next to strangers while enjoying a dinner with my friends. Kinda feels a little awkward when the strangers you're sitting next to is filming you catching food in your mouth."}
{"text":"Honestly the BEST ramen I have had here in Vegas. They have amazing broth and food, and excellent customer service. Our server made sure that we were happy with our meal and always had drinks to pair with it :) Awesome place for a comfortable atmosphere and good food"}
{"text":"We went out to eat here after reading the reviews and it was pretty good. For an appetizer we got the garlic edamame which was super flavorful. I had the shoyu ramen and added chicken in addition to the pork belly that it comes with. The chicken was very bland (hence the star knockdown). However, the pork belly and the broth were delicious! I didn't know I liked pork belly so much! 
The waiter also gave us an off-menu treat (sausage cut like an octopus) that they may be adding to their menu. It was pretty dang good. 
Further, the staff was extremely friendly, we discussed who they thought will win the McGreggor/Mayweather fight and they were very good with keeping up on refills and service. 

All in all, great experience and will be back."}
{"text":"Food is great but the customer service is poor. Waiters won't wait on you they'll seat you then forget about you. Then your order will be taken wrongly, and you'll be waiting an extra 20 mins while everyone who has arrived after you is eating happily... that sucks don't ya think  it's not even a busy hour yet they act like there's a million customers inside. Oh and I got \"20% off\" with NO CHANGE.. hilarious"}
{"text":"Tried this place out since it was closer than Chinatown, excellent.  I was going to a ramen noodle place one block over and this tops it all.  Food was tasty and more selection on the menu.  Service was outstanding, I highly recommend you give this place a try.  Thank you Sienna and Ging (sorry if I spelled your name wrong."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Ramen was awesome, gyoza was awesome, service was great, chicken katsu just okay. Love their hot tea too, reminds me of what I used to get in Japan. Next time we are in Vegas, we will stop by again!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have actually had ramen where I didn't make it  myself a la Top Ramen. I was struggling a bit with the menu because I know I love Oxtail but I saw that it came with \"Wood Fungus\" . I was a bit put off and scared so I'm glad the waitress explained that it is like mushrooms . I can definitely do mushrooms so after that I felt more relaxed . Personally I think they should call it a mushroom,truffle something along those lines ....it just sounds more appetizing. 

The broth was perfect on such a gloomy day. There was plenty of fresh green onions, and spinach in the soup as well. The Ox tail was tender and filling along with the noodles. I would order this again. 

Ohjah is no stranger to me because I do love eating in their teppanyaki restaurants. It was nice to see them branch out and try something new . The noodle house feels very relaxing to me with all of the woodlike decor. It's a great place to meet up with a friend and catch up over a bowl of soup."}
{"text":"The ramen was alright, a very limited selection - my family Enjoyed there's alright- not too
Impressed , I had the veggie which is bound to be less flavorful but it was very bland and I've definitely had much better veggie broths. It is a very small space and it was a long wait 30-40 minutes. The employees are very nice! Great service- that alone will make me possibly
Return one day."}
{"text":"Ohjah stole my heart! 

The shoyu ramen is my favorite. The flavor of the broth is perfectly blended with the right amount of chashu, toppings, and noodles. I get a side of chili paste to add the extra kick! Also love the fact that the bowls come WITH the toppings. 

My husband likes to get a side of the garlic oil. It adds more flavor, but can get salty. 

Nice and peaceful environment. The employees are friendly and don't wait on taking your order. Which I love! 

Ohjah never disappoints and always fulfills my ramen cravings."}
{"text":"I really don't like ramen except ohjah noodle house's ramen! It's very delicious and price is good. like it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more, but I thought it was just ok. I love their hibachi locations and thought all the other raving Yelp reviews had this place as a definite winner, but unfortunately it was not the case for me.

I loved the set up and decor of this place. It sort of reminded me of a sauna room, but in a trendy version. Food wise I had the Tan Tan Men ramen. The flavor was ok, nothing extraordinary. It also said it was spicy on the menu, but I didn't taste barely any spice. 

Maybe it was just an off day for me or I should have tried a different flavor, but it unfortunately just didn't hit the spot for me."}
{"text":"Great ramen! 
We ordered the shoyu ramen and Ohjah House ramen, and they're great! There was a lot of toppings in both ramen, but the Ohjah House ramen was amazing!
We also ordered gyoza, shrimp fried rice, and takoyaki -- all were great!
In addition, we ordered the chicken karaage - which was not so great because the pieces were quite small and there was a lot of breading. 
The service was great and we would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yep I was passing by and this place was unbelievable.
-Fast, Friendly, Great portions, cheap, clean, good music, Great seating, and authentic ramen."}
{"text":"Came here two or three times now and take friends who come to Vegas to visit. Food, atmosphere, and especially service here is top notch. There's also coupons in the mail sometimes for free appetizers, so that's also a bonus! (Will not say no to free takoyaki)

Food: Tan tan men, Tonkatsu Ramen, & Takoyaki

Tan tan men was not very spicy, but they gave us some spice on the side to add on. Flavor of both broths are very deep and satisfying. It's not overly salty like some ramen places can be. Noodles have a nice bite to them and toppings included with each ramen bowl are very generous. Usually you have to add things like egg for an extra dollar, but it's included here in most choices. You also can't go wrong with takoyaki, ever. It's well made and is not over sauced. 

What is better than the food here? SERVICE. 

We ordered extra noodles and the manager swung by, noticed my bowl was a little low on broth. He asked if we would like more broth for the noodles. I was a little concerned that he would charge, but he said free of charge! How could you eat your noodles without broth? It came out in a separate bowl, piping hot. Amazing. Our waters were also always filled and we never felt like we needed to wave down someone, they were on top of their game! (without being overbearing) They really want to make sure you enjoy your ramen here & that we did!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We had a shrimp ramen with vegetable broth which my girlfriend loved. I had the ohjah ramen and it was solid. We received our food quickly and the service was excellent! We also tried the green tea cheesecake. It didn't have a strong green tea flavor which I liked. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I really like this location. It's convenient, has nice finishes, spacious interior, and friendly staff. On my last visit here, I ordered the Ohjah Ramen, which includes oxtail, beef, chashu, and egg as the main proteins. The oxtail was super tender (side note: it's not often I come across tender oxtail meat)! I also ordered gyoza, which also did not disappoint.

I was, however, a bit disappointed that they didn't have regular coke available at the time, but the hot green tea made up for it. I usually don't drink a hot beverage with my ramen, but they had my favorite green tea with brown rice (genmaicha) which I think goes very well with the bold pork broth.

Service is great. Nothing to really complain about. They have a good variety of ramen choices, so I will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch, first time here. Not very busy at this point to. Ordered fried oysters, calamari for appetizers. It was good. Had the House Ramen with ox tail. The broth was delicious, very flavorful but not salty or overwhelming. The staff was friendly and very attentive! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Mmm, it seems like they improved their recipe yet again. Yum!  Upgrade to 4.5 stars.

They have these new nicer bowls for the ramen.  The bowls are taller, which I think is nice because there is less splashing on my clothing (I am a messy eater LOL).  I think maybe the bowl kept the broth hotter for longer, too.  

The ramen broth was even more delicious than before.  The spiciness is from shredded fresh peppers and less dependent on chili oil.  The chashu is like American BBQ style now, crispy on the edges - I really like it a lot!  This place never seems that full, which makes me sad.  Give them a try!  They are always very friendly and constantly refilling your drinks and checking on you."}
{"text":"Nice alternative to close by competitors but disappointed by the lack of detail of types of noodles on the menu. 

Ohjah provides both thin and thick noodles, and the tonkatsu ramen comes in thin. If I had known, I would have ordered thick noodles. 

Although the ox tail is Ohjah's house special, I didn't find anything special about it. I also wasn't a fan of the spinach due to conflicting texture with the ramen. 

The waiters were friendly and attentive, always checking in."}
{"text":"Awesome noodle house. Delicious, inexpensive, great service and the space was very comfortable and clean. Enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere that was close by without any wait. We didnt have any high expectations because we had no clue about this place. Seems like this will be our new ramen spot tho!! The oxtail ramen and miso ramen were both very delicious. I got the miso ramen with medium spicy level and it was perfect. Soup base wasnt too salty either. The servers were both attentive and kept our refills on point. No need to go to chinatown for ramen now I guess!"}
{"text":"Great food for my first time going to a noodle house. Back in Atlanta the few we have are in north Ga/ATL. This place has great ramen. I had the shrimp ramen and added pork and chicken to and it was satisfying. Be prepared to spend about 12-18 dollars here on a entree and a drink."}
{"text":"So Ohjah decides to follow the path of Monta. The oxtail ramen is definitely the highlight of  my dinner. For $11.5, i think pretty good deal. I am no ramen expert, but I think pretty comparable with Sora or Jinya. Much more spacious than those other ramen places though, which is a plus in my book. 

Server is nice enough to offer extra soup when she realizes my ramen has no more soup. As long as they keep their consistency, I am sure they will be as successful as other ramen places."}
{"text":"First time here and we ordered house Raman, tonkotsu Raman and Yaki gyoza. It was really good and impressed by the rich and flavorful both and the perfectly cooked noodle. So good !

The owners have put a lot of heart, research and care into this restaurant and it shows.

Highly recommend come and try for yourself."}
{"text":"I was excited to find out another ramen house opened up in my neighborhood! However, after trying this place, it was quite disappointing.

I ordered the miso ramen and chicken wings. I love my food spicy so I asked if they can make it spicy. They had mild, medium and extra spicy. I had them make it extra spicy. 

The miso ramen was bland, along with the noodles. Because I ordered it extra spicy it did have a kick to it, but that's all. The chashu that came with the miso had a weird smell/taste to it. It had a pork smell/taste to it like they didn't prepare the meat prior to cooking. 

The chicken wings was not bad. Just like regular deep fried wings. Very small wings. But they were good. Crispy on the outside. Given with a sweet chili dipping sauce. 

Overall, it was quite disappointing. I may give it another chance with a different ramen off their menu. But not anytime soon."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the Southwest side of town and discovered Ohjah Noodle House. We are vegan and although there are only a few vegan options, they are wonderful! Seaweed salad, edamames with garlic and their vegetarian ramen bowl are all amazing! The staff is extremely friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"I got the Ohjah special which was he oxtail ramen. It was pretty good but kinda oily. I'll be back to try the miso ramen next time and that should really give me more knowledgeable opinion on his place (I've never had oxtail ramen before)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome ! Finally a ramen spot with space . It's probably the most  authentic spot in town , the only place I have seen put the fish cake in the ramen . Good environment . Thumbs up for me"}
{"text":"I have no complaints about this place.
Honestly one of the best noodle restaurants in SW area. When Kobo opened up next door, it was too hyped up. Given, the noodles are made fresh everyday but they don't offer any other special appetizers. The portion is small and the chashu is mostly just fat. 

I'm so happy Ohjah opened up a noodle house concept. Their oxtail is surprisingly tender and full of flavor and the noodles are cooked to perfection. The soup is delicious- never too salty or oily like other ramen/noodle spots. 

As for their appetizers, they offer a wide variety of great classic options such as Tako Wasabi, Squid Skewers (GET THE SKEWERS IT'S THE BEST!!!!) Takoyaki and fried oysters! The squid skewers are best I've had!! 

The service is always impeccable- Genie and Leo are really kind and were really attentive, contributing to our amazing experience here. Leo is so passionate about the food here he'll tell you all about how everything is made. 

Thank you Ohjah and Mr. Wong for bringing such an awesome restaurant to this side of town!!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting. The Tan Tan Ramen  and Miso Ramen were perfectly seasoned. Tried the garlic edamame - delicious. Fried octopus was amazing. Excellent service. I'll def visit again."}
{"text":"I got the spicy miso. It was pretty good but not spicy enough for my taste. They also have the lunch special for ramen, which is cheaper than a normal ramen bowl. 

Came here for lunch but didn't really have to wait long for our food to be ready. 

I was still fine after the meal but my friend who ordered the same thing got a stomachache and she said she would never come back here. I would still come back here for a quick lunch as it's on my side of town."}
{"text":"So glad another Ramen place opened up close to me!  The ambiance here is very clean and relaxing. Unlike many ramen places in China Town, it does not feel cramped with everyone within spitting distance of each other. The service was great and our waiter was very attentive. My bf and I ordered the pan fried oysters and house special ramen. We felt it was good, but not as flavorful as some of the other ramen places. We will try it again and order something else to see if it's better."}
{"text":"Great ramen with fast and very friendly service. Excellent gyoza and chicken wings. I had the beef ramen and it was beautiful and delicious. Definitely will be coming here again and again."}
{"text":"This place is not busy tonight and yet the two servers are slow and not attentive as much. We asked for the shrimp tempura roll because we had a coupon for a free one (which they took the coupon). We received an order of shrimp tempura and was charged for it and was not informed until after the bill, and which they did not change it for us. The chicken karaage is a really small order, ours came with 4 pieces and the picture on the menu shows at least 8 pieces. We asked to get the tonkotsu ramen and to take out everything except the meat and egg(noodles and soup included) and our server was confused and rude towards us because he could not figure out the ordering system on the ipad. We asked to add ground pork to our soup and was explained to us (in frustration) that the soup does not come with it. We simply said, we would like to add it because it's on the toppings options. Also, this place is small enough where we can see the bar where they cook. We overheard our server say, \"They wanted to remove everything, remove remove remove *grunts*\" Food was not all that good either because of the small amount we had of it. 
Was not pleased with our experience here."}
{"text":"Best ramen ever??its amazing make sure to order beef or oxtail ramen??its sooo good,i luv this location cos only take me 5mins from my house"}
{"text":"Great Place! Waiting for the one in Henderson to open. Great Service lots of Ramen options. Tonkatsu was great, fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"The food was great and the servers are very attentive! They accommodated to all my food requests and my meal came out perfect. The garlic edamame is delicious. This is my new favorite noodle spot!"}
{"text":"Service is fast and quick. Got the house fried noodles which tasted great. Takoyaki was nice and pretty cheap too."}
{"text":"This is 5 mins away from my house. I tried their Tonkatsu Ramen. I ordered it Togo coz I didn't have much time. First time I tried it.
It was great, delicious, creamy and rich. My wife loved it.
She wants me to take her there one of these days. Want to try all the other ramens, and the squid skewer."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite Ramen places now. I love the tonkatsu Ramen there. Great service and the food is good. The location is easy to find and the price is reasonable. Definitely for place to check it out if you are a Ramen lover. :) we also ordered some appetizer such a gyoza, edamame, and fried rice. All of those was just okay to me. But my kids liked their miso ramen as well. I think they should add some flavor to the fried rice and stirred fried noodles. Those are a little bland."}
{"text":"Love the decor.  Excellent service.  We went the first week it was open.  We haven't been back since.  The food was ok.  We prefer Ramen Kobo better.  I would say if we're craving ramen and didn't want to wait at Ramen Kobo or drive anywhere else, we would go here."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch with a girlfriend after the other Ramen house was too packed and I am so glad I did I Love this place! So much better then the ramen house down the street. The food quality is better and you get bigger portions the bowl was so big I had to take it home. The service was amazing, very friendly and personable waiters. He was able to recommend the best bowl for us. We both got the ox tail Ramen and it was delicious. They have gained a loyal customer I will be coming here frequently and they also gave us free mochi to try it was so good. I definitely recommend this place to all the Ramen lovers."}
{"text":"Ohjah is well known as a high quality food and high service japenese restaurant,i love their hibachi and sushi. After I know that they opened a noodle, I went there to try a lot of food ..I ordered chicken wings,takoyaki,shrimp fried rice ,house beef and shoyu ramen, so yummy!!! I will  come back next time!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place-
Haven't been to the other locations, but the Durango location has amazing staff, amazing chefs and amazing flavor.

Always leave happy and no matter what you get it is good.

Environment is comfortable, late night the music can be slightly louder, but if it's too loud the staff is receptive and friendly to request to lower volume.

It's my absolute go to spot for Pho."}
{"text":"We used to live by Eastern/215 and we have this fave place to eat ramen but since we moved by Durango/Warm Springs, We are in search of a place that would satisfy our craving for authentic ramen, then we found OHJAH NOODLE HOUSE!!! Now we found our new favorite place! To start with we ordered takoyaki and its combination of crunchy and creamy texture makes you crave for more. Then we ordered Tonkatsu Ramen ( where ever we go this is a must in our order) Chicken Katsu for my daughter and then we wanted to try one of there house special TanTan Men Ramen. Everything we order came so fast and was so so good! The servers are so accomodating checking on us everytime, they even offered extra soup for our ramen. They even mention the promo they have if you do review them on yelp. Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"My wife and I received a coupon in the mail for this place, so we decided to check it out. I've seen these restaurants around town, but never made it in here. 

When driving here I was trying to figure out this place opened up right next to Kobo ramen . After eating their food (gyoza, miso ramen, tan tan men) I highly doubt Kobo will be much of a competition for Ohjah. My wife and I will be returning, and, honestly, will not be going to Kobo again.

Atmosphere:
- comfortable 
- not noisy
- plenty of space for seating
- clean
Staff:
- friendly
- knowledgeable
- doesn't rush 
- recommends 
Food:
- delicious (doesn't beat Sora, but best on this side of town)
- Asahi  (my favorite beer)

Again, we will be returning.  I would recommend this place to anyone who wants good ramen without having to drive to China town to get it. 

Good job Ohjah. Thank you for serving us"}
{"text":"Super yummy and a great fix for ramen if you don't want to make the drive to chinatown. Tonkatsu and Shoyu ramen were good and the fried rice was big enough for two people. Quiet and clean little restaurant with fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Aesthetically pleasing, like no other. 
Good service. Felt very authentic. 
The noodles were good, I just don't think it was our cup of tea. 
The Mongolian beef pancakes were awesome, but a little too much on the greasy side. 
I had a great amount of meat in the pork and mushroom entree. 
Just not our bag"}
{"text":"First time here and it was great! Had garlic edamame, veggie spring rolls and veggie house noodles. My Daughter had the Miso Ramen bowl and it was good. We both had the mango cream soda which was yummy!!! We will definitely return! The music was great as well! No complaints here!! Great to know about this local spot!!"}
{"text":"This was great! The food was delicious, the server Audrey was helpful and patient and the restaurant is clean and cool! 
We loved the Gyoza and the miso broth was my favorite"}
{"text":"I had their Oxtail Ramen and their fried rice - both were excellent.  The oxtail has nice meaty chunks of oxtail inside as well as an entire piece of oxtail.  They cooked the oxtail to a perfect temperature that was juicy but not tough.  The broth was rich and the other ingredients blended together really nicely.

The store is located in a strip mall with plenty of parking around.  It's really new and clean inside.  I Ike how they have an open kitchen so you can see that the food was prepared with care."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. Wanted try something new and the ramen is awesome. Very hardy. Never tried ramen with ox tail before and it was awesome. Try the garlic edamame also. It was really good and a great starter."}
{"text":"Decided to come here on a friend's recommendation.  He said their oxtail ramen was really good and unique.  Came here for lunch and I ordered their special beef ramen and my friend ordered the oxtail ramen.  I ordered mine medium spicy and she ordered it hot.  Spice comes in the form of a chili oil paste thats not premixed, just on top of the soup.  So you can mix a little first to see how you like it.  I thought medium was a little too hot so I scooped out some of the chili oil.

The noodles were good and I really enjoyed their broth but I did not like the flavor or the texture of their meat.  It was thin slices of tendenous beef.  It wasn't chewy or tough but I thought it didn't go well with the broth.  Also I love the texture of soft pork belly chashu much more.  My friend's oxtail was good but again it was a little weird eating it with ramen.  It didn't seem to go together very well.  But the oxtail was cooked well and pretty tender.

I would come back again but next time I'm definitely sticking to their traditional ramen with chashu meat.  I enjoyed their broth and noodles and their ramen comes with half of a soft boiled egg which is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Saw the high reviews so my family and I wanted to try this place since we tried another Ramen place just up the street 2 days ago. 

Luckily there was no wait time cuz there no customers. I don't know if it was just slow cuz it was a Sunday but we were excited to try the Ramen. 

To our disappointment, we actually didn't enjoy the Ramen much. The broth had an off taste. Usually when a soup is served it should be served really hot with the steam rising above the bowl buts ours did not. It was luke warm. I ordered the beef ramen and added an extra egg and bamboo shoots. I tasted the bamboo shoots alone and it tasted rancid. My sister had the tan tan Ramen Bowl and said the ground pork tasted old and gamey. 

On the up side, we ordered takoyaki as our appetizers. It was our first time trying it and it was actually tasty. I expected them to be bigger cuz the pictures on Yelp made it look huge but they were small. 

Customer service was ok. Even after we received our appetizers, we were still missing 3 plates and 3 sets of silverware so I had my son walk up to the waitress to ask her and my son brought us back all the plates and silverware to our table himself.

Overall, we were disappointed. I don't know if it was an off day for this place. I'm sure they have a lot of potential reading all the great reviews. I don't think we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor of this restaurant has a nice feel to it. I ordered a Shoyu ramen and it was delicious. The broth was light and there is a great amount of ingredients that came with the bowl. Also, the service is great here."}
{"text":"Belly is stuffed!!  Couldnt stop eating :) tepanyaki grill was so much fun and of course so were the Sake shots"}
{"text":"First time here.. been driving by this place but wanted to check it out.. 
Was seated right way and food was on point 
Another ramen spot on my list!! Customer service was excellent.. 
Ordered edamame but since it went to another table they gave me another one and didn't charge me! Yay!! Thank you!! Ill be back!!"}
{"text":"The broth is amazing, be careful though, their medium spicy is unlike other Ramen houses spice level, I would say go with mild or spice on the side but it still didn't take away from the amazing broth. Takoyaki was very good, we got the ohjah house Ramen and that was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Whoa! What took us so long to get here? The two of us came here for lunch ( based on what else? Yelp reviews! ) and we both had the lunch special which consisted of chicken ramen noodles, your choice of either mild, medium or extra spicy. The bowl was plentiful and had egg, ramen noodles, chicken strips and a superb mix of spices. I started to break a sweat as my face started to \"glisten\" lol! 

When we arrived, we were immediately greeted and seated by a very friendly and attentive server. He bowed to us repeatedly. Great service here. The menu is diverse and you are encouraged to customize your bowl with your choice of broth, noodles, and choice of protien or veggies along with eggs. The decor and ambiance was very nice. Best part of the experience, other than the food, was the service. 

There are 5 locations including one in Pahrump in case your packing a huge appetite after leaving the Chicken Ranch! 

But i digres. The best part was we both got out for under 15 bucks. 15 bucks!!! You cant eat anywhere else with this great of food with fresh quality ingredients. Be sure to check them out. 

AAA +++"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed in this ramen joint. I'd give it 1 star for the ramen I ordered. The broth was lack luster and tasted oily rather than a rich broth taste. The only reason I put 3 stars because the takoyaki was very good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Very friendly service! There are many delicious soups that are offered with yummy appetizers. Food was out within 5 minutes of ordering. I ordered the Miso Soup Ramen and my date ordered the Ohjah House Ramen, both two thumbs up! Very reasonably priced considering how huge the portions are. Thanks Ohjah House!"}
{"text":"Alike most I saw the high reviews and decided to try this joint. In Vegas I've tried Kobo, Monta, Sora and Ohjah. I suggest if you want tasty ramen, you try those places in that order before this place (monta and kobo are interchangeable but kobo makes their noodles in house). Ohjah lacks flavor and often serves ramen warm and not hot. I've also ordered a regular noodle dish which was drenched in sauce and was basically a soul. I appreciate their attempts to load the bowls of ramen to look good for pictures but a lot of what their noodle soup dishes have don't mix well for flavor."}
{"text":"The service outstanding no complain. The noodle soup taste really bad, noodle kind hard soup base taste weird and plain.  This place definitely not recommend for people who's looking for authentic Japanese Ramen."}
{"text":"Oxtail and shrimp ramen are my favorites!  Just the right amount of salt in the broth - most ramen places are just too salty!!!"}
{"text":"If like me you've struggled to find good ramen in Vegas, give Ohjah Noodle House a shot. Their Tonkatsu ramen is on point. The broth is incredibly flavorful with the right amount of thickness. The egg is perfectly cooked with a gooey center. Noodles are properly cooked and the right thickness as well. My only critique, if I had to pick one, would be the tenderness of the meet. Aside from that, the ramen was nearly a 5 Star!"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise as we came here only after the restaurant we wanted to go to across the street was unexpectedly closed and a quick Yelp search showed Ohjah Noodle House nearby with a four star rating. Service was quick and professional, the food was fresh and tasty, my oxtail pho was quite good, even for a non Pho lover like me."}
{"text":"I love Ohjah so when I saw Ohjah noodle house i had to come and try it out. I was not disappointed! Everything was delicious.  We ordered the gyoza which was cooked perfectly not overly burnt and not too greasy.  My hubby got the oxtail soup. He loved it and he is the ultimate foodie snob. The oxtail was fall of the bone tender and was MEATY!  I got the shoyo ramen. It was delish however I still prefer monta's broth. but nonetheless I was very pleased."}
{"text":"Yes, they finally have a Yelp page! Saw a month + ago that Ohjah is opening up a Noodle a.k.a Ramen place near my house and had been dying to try it out. I have been to Ohjah's two other locations for their hibachi, which I am a big fan of but Japanese ramen is a pretty new concept to this brand. Ever since the Noodle House's opening last week, I have already been there twice, trying different ramen and side dishes each time. I have to say that when it comes to ramen, broth is one of the most important thing to me, next being the noodle. The broth is flavorful and the noodle the right texture. It is definitely one of the better ramen-offering place in the Southwest part of Las Vegas. The interior design is modern and trendy; the place is also located at a convenient location where new shops and restaurants are popping up. Also wanted to mention that their waiter and waitresses are super nice and polite that I double-tipped them. I hope their excellent customer service never change!

I have tried their Tonkotsu Ramen, Shoyo Ramen, Ohjah House Ramen, Seafood Ramen, Takoyaki, and Tako Wasabi so far --- all are great! I'm definitely looking forward to going back and try more different dishes."}
{"text":"Hello, and welcome to Ohjah Noodle House. We like the ohjah brand and decided to try their noodle house for a different style of night out. We at first tried the one in Henderson but the line was way too long and very busy. We then adventured to the southwest side of town and found this one busy but welcoming. Ohjah is not a huge place but big enough with about 8 tables and good vibe. We were seated and given drinks and menus right away. We ordered the Yaki Gyoza, best way to describe it is a dumpling. Had good flavor with a spicy dipping sauce. We also ordered the shrimp skewers, which resemble little lolly pops. These were quite crispy and had a spicy mayo drizzle. For the main meal I ordered the beef ramen and Josie ordered the chicken Ramen. Both are priced well and offer a full bowl of flavor. Comes with a hard boiled egg in the middle, scallions, beansprouts, seaweed and root fungus. Neither were spicy and the broth was exceptional. Not overly impressed with the noodles but we may have had a different expectation due to past experiences at other noodle spots. The staff was very attentive and had refills before being asked. 
Thank you for eating at Ohjah Noodle house. We would for sure go here again and possibly try the one in Henderson. Stop in and give it a try I am sure you will be satisfied with your decision."}
{"text":"Tried his place out based on a recommendation from a coworker and I enjoyed it very much! The restaurant is quite spacious in comparison to other Noodle houses so getting a table wasn't difficult. The staff is very courteous and friendly. 

I ended up ordering the Ohjah House Ramen ($11.95) with black garlic oil (Additional $1.00), which came with the works (Pork, beef, and oxtail and all the added fixens). The ramen was delicious! The meat was cooked well and tasted perfect. They give you a little side dish to put leftover bones from the oxtail, as well, so they aren't left in the ramen. After finishing, I felt full without feeling like I ate too much. They gave us a little candy with the check and we left! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Have had sora and jinya, this is going to be my new spot for ramen. Excellent service and amazing food. Ordered their house ramen with oxtail and house fried rice, yummy! Nice decoration as well! Also a good spot for date night!"}
{"text":"Service from staff was great! They were really friendly and attentive. Ramen here was between good and okay. The bar is pretty high for good ramen in vegas. Things like the fried rice and The gyoza were good as well."}
{"text":"The ramen is huge and savory, and the noodles are a perfect combination of soft/firm. The flavors are all there! The ramen comes with an egg included, which was a huge plus. We also got the egg roll and spring roll appetizers, which were amazing. Some of the best spring rolls we've ever had. 

The service was exceptional. Drinks were constantly refilled and the staff were super friendly. I think this will be our go-to ramen place from now on!"}
{"text":"Veggie ramen was awesome and the beef in the beef ramen was tender plus the green tea cheese cake was dope :)"}
{"text":"Went here with my daughter because Ramen Kobo (both places are close to home. )  The atmosphere was excellent, the servers were amazing, but the food left a lot to be desired. My daughter is into everything Asian right now (food, clothes, tea, you name it she's into it) so we've been to a lot of ramen places locally.  The food was edible, but not in the same ballpark as some of the other places we've been.  Left us wanting Ramen Kobo, Monta or Jinya."}
{"text":"Decided to try his place out after seeing the open signs recently.  When I'm in the mood for ramen I don't usually like to drive far so up until now Ramen Kobo had been our quick go to spot. Ohjah was a nice change of pace! They have a nice variety of ramen to choose from, with very reasonable prices.  Also love how they have other appetizers and main dishes to choose from as well.  The restaurant itself is spacious and comforts ale. Staff was very attentive and friendly, not the fastest service but it's still their soft opening! 

We tried the seafood ramen, tan tan men, and ohjah house ramen. Although not stated on the menu they can customize the spice level. Medium spice here was just enough to give you nice flavor without burning you up. Mild was basically no spice. The ramen broth is creamy and hearty. Seafood ramen had a whole assortment of seafood including fish, shrimp, clams, crab legs, squid along with the veggies and seaweed. The ohjah house ramen had tender oxtail included which I was surprised to see, but great flavor!  I also commend them on the soft boiled egg which you don't have to pay extra for in there ramen. For me ramen isn't complete without it!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in tonight about 15 minutes prior to closing and they still sat us down and gave us time to order with no pressure. Amazing customer service and the nicest people. I had the ox-tail ramen and it was delicious, super tender and just enough spice. I live nearby so I will be coming back often. Super impressed with this place and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here on the weekday for dinner and it look like they had about 10 to 13 different table and almost every table was full which was a good thing meaning at least the food here was good. My husband found this place because we had ox tail Ramen in Hawaii and he fell in love with it and when he found out there was a place nearby that sold it we just had to visit. As a Korean and usually ox tail soup is more of a creamy white broth.. so when the ramen came out it was surprisingly regular but it had a huge oxtail bones with plenty of meat. I personally have a spinach allergy and I asked them to remove the spinach and I am happy to note that they did exactly what I requested. 

The Ramen was really good not as good as the one in Hawaii but fairly good my husband thinks it was pretty decent and I really appreciate it how they had a lot of meat on the bone. The flavors were mixed well and I could see myself coming here again."}
{"text":"Arrived with my friends close to closing time and it was either this restaurant or Ramen Kobo -  they're on the same street but this one had higher ratings so we went there instead.

My thing with gyoza is I always calculate the price per gyoza (yes I'm that friend) and if it's about $1/per I won't get it since it won't be worth it price and portion. I opt out here since it was $4.75 for 5 pieces.

My friend got the TanTan Men, Bun got the Tonkatsu and I got Miso. My friend liked the TanTan Men but Bun didn't like the Tonkatsu. The most memorable item in my bowl.. was the naruto! hehe I love fishcake, it was thicker cut than normal so I was happy

The ramen itself was meh. I asked for chili oil twice - I had a feeling the first time I asked, they were intentionally hoarding it but then Bun asked for me and it was delivered - this helped made it easier for me to finish my bowl, unfortunately Bun didn't finish his haha 

The bill was split - Bun and my bowl were under $20 so it was standard. It wasn't very memorable and I wouldn't go back unless a friend picked it, or it was the only left thing around that is open. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either."}
{"text":"It great ramen and a good price. The service was excellent. I had the Ohjah House Special Ramen. It had oxtail, char sui and bean sprouts with my choice of soy broth. Yeah you get to choose your broth.   Definitely recommend and i will return."}
{"text":"My family and I came to Ohjah Noodle House for dinner last night. To be honest, I'm not a huge ramen fan so I guess you can disregard my review now.

My family shared an order of takoyaki and an order of gyoza. As for my main course, I decided to go with the Tan Tan Men. They offered different levels of spiciness for it: mild, medium, and extra spicy. I decided to go with the extra spicy because I love spicy stuff. 

The gyoza was okay. A little on the salty side. In fact, you don't even need to dip it into the soy sauce at all. Just eat it by itself. Pretty average. Nothing special. It is what you would expect it to be.

The takoyaki wasn't that great. There was nothing special about it and I've had better. It didn't come hot, which was disappointing. I usually love it when my takoyaki is served steaming hot ... because that's how its served. At Ohjah, though, it was just warm and a little on the harder side and not the soft texture like I'm used. 

Then came the Tan Tan Men. It came with a nice scoop of chili paste on top, similar to sambal. The server was really nice though; he said if it wasn't spicy enough then he'll bring me more chili paste or I could use chili powder. Well, I can say that their extra spicy wasn't really spicy. I didn't want to bother with the extra chili paste because if it really was sambal, it's not spicy. 

There were a lot of reviews stating that their extra spicy was supposed to be no joke? Maybe I came on an off day or something? Because I really didn't taste anything spicy.

As for the soup flavor, it didn't really capture me. Everything tasted pretty boring. The noodles themselves were good though .. they were cooked al dente, which is perfect!

According to my family, the oxtail is very good -- the meat is tender and has really good flavor. 

The service is pretty good though. Our server would check up on us from time to time and refilled our waters promptly.

Overall, I probably won't return. There wasn't anything that I loved :( But that's fine. I'll just stick to their hibachi locations haha."}
{"text":"I love this place!! They have the best ramen around with the best price! Every time I go here the service is nothing but exceptional. I would definitely try their Tonkotsu Ramen, it is by far the best tasting plate but beware, it is a bit spicy. Their beer is also very cheap here so give it a try as well.  

P.S: if it's your first time here I recommend trying the Ohjah House Ramen, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Excellent Ramen! Service is fantastic. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and clean dining! Greeting upon arrival, seated promptly by our waitress. She kept checking up on us while we waited, ate, and finished our order. Takoyaki appetizer which is a squid ball with sauce and toppings was great, must order! If only they gave more than just four pcs. Next time 2 orders would be better. Ordered the oxtail ramen with miso base for soup and it was unbelievably good. Oxtail was tender and flavorful. Great ramen place but too far out from my home. I just happened to be in the area. Will most likely return!"}
{"text":"This is one of my family's all time favorite places to eat!  The staff is friendly, and our glasses of water are never empty.  The different broths for the ramen are all flavorful and so good, and their noodles are cooked perfectly al dente...firm, but not hard.  Not only is their ramen good, but my kids devour the yakisoba, fried rice, and their House Salmon entree. We also love their garlic edamame, gyoza, and fried chicken wings.  We've been there so many times that when it's time to order, the staff say \"the usual?\""}
{"text":"Excellent Ramen, I had the Tan Tan noodle with char shu and fried oysters. They were great. The young ladies serving where very polite and wonderful."}
{"text":"This is our go to neighborhood noodlehouse. It has much better menu selection, comfortable seating, and cleaner than Ramen Kobo (just down the street). Love the friendly staff and manager is super sweet and very humble. Food quality is decent. I like that the menu just has the right amount of selection where you don't get lost than other restaurants that are malnourishly limited. They have  chicken, pork, beef, seafood, and veggies-that pretty much covers everything. We will continue to support this place."}
{"text":"Came in and immediately loved the vibe. They were on point when it came to service and were extremely friendly. Our food came out with speedy fashion. The broth itself wasn't as flavorful as I'm used to, but it was passable. I suggest adding garlic oil and some hot seasoning for more of a taste. The restaurant is trendy and upbeat, but definitely a one time stop."}
{"text":"This is my second time. I didn't like it the first time but decided to give it another try. Still not happy. Their broth doesn't taste like Japanese broth at all to me. More like chinese soup."}
{"text":"Very delicious! My first Ramen experience. They were very informative on the menu. Decor is great, service is awesome!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite ramen spot in the south west area. Side note: I always end up choosing shoyu ramen wherever I go because it's my favorite type of broth, and I'm never disappointed when I visit Ohjah. I had the best service when I dined in recently. My family and I had this male server and he was so nice and helpful - I wish I got his name because he deserves the recognition on yelp! He even gave us garlic edamame on the house. I love their garlic edamame and how it has this smoky flavor. Our waiter always checked on us and always made sure our drinks were refilled. We were a party of 6 and all our food came out in less than 15 minutes! Glad my family ended up liking this place."}
{"text":"Going to keep it short.  Their oxtail ramen is very unique and taste good.  Glad I tried it."}
{"text":"Amazing Ramen The Miso is perfection!! Love the Shrimp tempora one of my Fav places to get it! And the Service is on point very quick efficient and friendly as well! And even with a full restaurant our Drinks never went unfilled"}
{"text":"The ambiance of the place is great. The staff is very friendly. I got the tonkatsu ramen with mild spice. I didnt really taste the spiciness though. Other than that, the food was great."}
{"text":"Simply on the food alone I'd rate a 2. The Ramen selection was great and I was very excited to try the Ohjah Special. Our ramen came out quickly and looked amazing, very photographic for you Instagram foodies. However we we dove into our picture perfect bowls of ramen, something was drastically missing....FLAVOR! My broth was so bland, I added the chili spices, chili oil and soy sauce to try and give it some flavor, it helped subtly. My husband ordered the Tan Tan Med and was told it would be spicy. His was as bland as mine. The staff was great the place is small but very clean and modern inside. The food however needs flavor, maybe garlic idk."}
{"text":"End of the week dinner called for takeout & Netflix. Ohjah is a neighborhood restaurant that I've been wanting to try let alone ramen again. I had a bad experience and refused to give it a second shot. But after multiple debates with myself, I gave in. 
I have been on this kick of eating vegetarian thanks to the recent documentary I watched so I had to go with the veggie ramen. Broth was just right and not salty at all! It was fully packed with noodles and veggies of all kind. Even with a medium spice level, it wasn't enough for me but they packed some extra on the side to help kick it up for the next level. 
I ordered ahead which only took about 15 minutes. The staff was absolutely amazing and so warm & welcoming. I will be sure to come back and will dine in to fully experience the atmosphere of this cozy neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC....my taste preference for good authentic ramen is pretty high. So when I moved to Vegas and found this gem I was impressed with the flavor of the pork bone broth.  Very rich, not greasy and most of all not overly salty.  A lot of ramen places mask the quality of the broth with salt...so that when you finish the noodles and all the topping you actually enjoy having the broth on its own.  The oxtail ramen is my favorite,  the oxtail is delicious bc they cook it so that the meat is super tender and easy to eat, even my 82 year old father with loose dentures can chew it  the egg is delicious and prepared correctly...well seasoned where the yolk is  soft boiled with a custard texture.  The chasu is delish and melts in your mouth.  All in all I really like this place and will come frequently, mostly bc I literally live next door to it 5 minutes away."}
{"text":"Hubby and I popped in here on a sleepy Saturday morning, having just arrived in town for the weekend.  Although this didn't sound like a traditional Japanese ramen place, we thought we'd give it a try based on it's ratings.

It wasn't busy nor did it get busy during our time there (which would have been peak lunch time)  but I'm guessing it's because this is a little further out from the Strip.  As a result, we were quickly greeted and seated.  

Nice interior (working a/c at this time of year is also a plus).  

We ordered the takoyaki, the house fried rice, tan tan ramen and I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with an oxtail-add on.

Takoyaki was really good...but not exactly traditional in that it appeared to be...deep fried??  Interesting...so pass if you're a purist.

Fried rice was a good solid fried rice.  The chasu used was fattier (a plus in my book) rather than the lean cuts you usually see in this dish.  Great flavor, too.

Next came the noodles.  Hubby's tan tan men noodle broth was sweeter than I'm accustomed to.  He was ok with it.  He mentioned it wasn't as rich as he would like.  The noodles were cooked perfectly, however.

For my tonkotsu, I have to give a shout-out on the oxtail...very tender and generous serving.  The broth was good too, tasting of pigs feet and bones. The chasu was cooked very tender.  The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of were the noodles.  They used thin noodles which I approve of but the texture of these particular noodles were more like somen.  No bite.

Service was friendly and awesome.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This ramen house is amazing when you consider it's not in Chinatown. While I'm not a huge ramen person,I am a big fan of the Miso Ramen which I order every time I go. Here at Ohjah Noddle House, you get great food at a fair price. The restaurant is very modern and open with fast service. The ramen portions are perfectly sized where I finish the bowl feel satisfied. So whether you dine in or take it to go, give this noodle House a shot."}
{"text":"The place looked clean, and the service was pretty quick too. I enjoyed the miso ramen as well as their takoyaki."}
{"text":"This place is great! Good prices for
Hibachi- used to just be for special occasions but thanks to this place I'll take my family more often. The steak and lobster was incredible and inexpensive."}
{"text":"We order ten ten man, takoyaki and house noodle, and the garlic edamame.. everything is super good and the atmosphere is really clean and nice as well. They just open the second location in Henderson.

My sever Felicia is very friendly and take care of us.

Will definitely visit here again !!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas has no shortage of ramen places. So, there is much to compare this to. I did not find the broth of the tonkotsu to be as rich or sophisticated as either Go!ku or Monta. It was by comparison much less interesting. Not entirely unenjoyable, but not incredible. So, for me Go!ku is a 5, Monta is a 4, and this is not quite as good, so it is a 3. Service is friendly though and not rushy like Monta, so bear that in mind."}
{"text":"Great service. Food is hot, fresh and super flavors. My two year old ate everything from the edamame to the ramen and pork belly. The entree salmon was delish. Straightforward menu - good prices. Yummy"}
{"text":"The food tasted amazing, the options to chose from were wonderful and I hope to try all of them. On top of everything, everyone is so friendly so you can't get a better experience than this!"}
{"text":"They have amazing customer service. Making sure I'm okay. And always there when I need my glass refilled. And I love the Miso Ramen. An amazing dish"}
{"text":"My bf and I walked in and we were automatically greeted and seated. I love how they explained the menu to us which is rare in most restaurants cause usually they would hand you a menu and take our orders after. Our server Aby was super nice and she always checked up on us so we never had to wait for her if we needed something. All the food we ordered was so good, I'm not really into ramen but this place hit the spot- 2 entrees and 3 appetizers and sake for about 30 bucks not bad at all!! They acknowledged that it was our first time; asking how we liked it and of course we loved it! Possibly our new fav ramen spot. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"While in Vegas we were craving some epic ramen. After searching and coming to the conclusion that all the good places were off the strip, we ended up taking a  quick 15 minute drive to this spot. Luckily, the place wasn't packed and we were immediately seated. Everything looked good on the menu so it was quite difficult to decide what to get, so we ended up getting a ton of stuff. We ended up getting everything from the gyoza to the chicken karage and even fried rice. Of course we got ramen too, but my favorite part of the meal was the fried rice. Imagine the fried rice from Bennihanas, but a million times better, bigger and cheaper. Everything else was pretty tasty too, but man oh man, I would totally make the trip just for that fried rice alone. Next time I'm planning on ordering a huge plate all to myself! Overall, if you're in the area and craving some yummy Japanese cuisine then definitely check this spot out."}
{"text":"Heard of Ohjah through Yelp whilst browsing through good finds, came across this and let me tell you, the environment is appealing, aesthetic and quiet! Ramen is bomb! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance. The servers were friendly and attentive. When we went on a Saturday night, we didn't have to wait long. I ordered the Ohjah Ramen and boy, it was yummy! The portion was huge, as well as the broth ratio and the meat items that it came with. The flavor of the broth was rich and not oily at all.  I enjoyed this place so much!!!"}
{"text":"A few months ago, I noticed that this place would be opening soon since my husband frequents Freedom Firearms a few doors down. Been here twice so far and I am happy that we finally have a good ramen place near our house! My favorite is still in Chinatown, but this is a good option for days that we don't have time to drive down there. 

The menu is similar to other ramen places - you get to choose your ramen and have the option to add additional toppings as well as extra noodles. They also have fried rice and fried noodles, appetizers and side dishes. So far I have tried the Shoyu and Miso Ramen. The Shoyu was good, but my favorite is the Miso because the broth was rich and very flavorful. I usually avoid drinking too much of any ramen broth for obvious reasons, but just had to take a few sips of this one since it was so good!

Service is excellent! The staff here are very friendly and attentive. They check up on you a few times so you can really tell that they care and want to provide great service. One drawback though, is that they don't have curry. I think a side curry bowl on the menu would be awesome! Definitely returning."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I was totally hesitant to go here as I am a \"keto\" dieter and was dreading noodles and rice but LOVE Asian food. The staff was wonderful, the meal was amazing and they accommodated my \"keto diet\" needs by substituting the rice and/or noodles for more proteins. I will definitely go back and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is great! The manager came out an personally greeted us and offered us fresh garlic and oil spices. I got the ohjah special which had oxtail. I thought that was unique! Never seen oxtail in ramen before. It was delicious"}
{"text":"I have never been one for ramen. My go-to was Monta and even then it's either alright or a salty surprise -- lame. This place is pretty good. I got the Ohjah House Ramen with the pork broth. It's rich, savory, and the veggies give the broth a nice tinge of freshness. They have oxtail as a topping and I love oxtail! I thought it might be like a scrawny piece but nah it was pretty fat.

Our servers were sweet to us too. I think their names were Holly and Diana. We were indecisive and they were accomodating; even making suggestions on what they liked and not just pointing out the expensive items.

Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Love it!! Everything good delicious here. They are known as best of steakhouse & hibachi. But I have to say by far first ramen noodles house they are so good!! Definitely will be back again!!"}
{"text":"I had the Miso Ramen, seaweed salad, and sake. It all was presented very nicely and tasted good but the morning after was another story. Let's just say I'm glad that a shower was near the toilet... not quite food poisoning but enough to ruin my morning."}
