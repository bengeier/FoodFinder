{"text":"5 stars for the food, -4 for the waiter. I went with my girlfriend during the summerlicious. The guy probably didn't want to work there anymore, because he was so bored, he was almost angry serving us. The next day, my friend went there and got the same treatment."}
{"text":"Stopped for a drink with my date a few nights ago. Sat at the bar. 

When we asked the bartender about a couple of drinks on the menu, he was flustered and admitted to not having tried most of their cocktails before bumbling over a few halfhearted recommendations. Not very impressive for the man behind the bar. 

Drinks were pretty good, buy I wasn't interested in staying for a second."}
{"text":"If your looking for quality food that won't burn a whole in your pocket, you've found the place! From the service to the food it's a perfect package. The prefixed menu is the best in town, serving up their regular quality at an affordable price. They have fresh Atlantic Salmon that's cooked juicy and tender, with a load of fresh vegetables and some good old rice pilaf. I have to say vegetables aren't my thing but let me tell you they have made it steamed perfection. You can top it off with a delicious creme brulee that is a whole lotta heaven in your mouth. The great service tops off a terrific package that can not be refused. The staff have complimented the great chefs in the back with amazing and enjoyful service."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and thought we should try it out.

Had prix-fixe with a bottle of red. One of our wine glasses was noticeably crusted and spotted. Weird that you could miss it. Don't they polish their glasses before service time?

The paella dish was a huge heaping of white rice and the mix was bland and lacked any seasoning; just tomato sauce out of a can really. There was a lot, so I could see some people favoring portion over flavour.
My friend had the lambshank and was so disappointed at how bland it was. It was literally like eating boiled meat.

The desserts were fine, nothing I can't get at a grocery store. Our waitress was very terse,  just dropped our plates on the table and couldn't pour a proper glass of wine without clanking on the glass or drizzling wine on the table.

Overall, I was surprised, this place really didn't live up to the reviews. Makes me wonder who's writing those reviews."}
{"text":"Ahhh, what a way to ruin a perfectly amazing day.

We walked in hoping to get a nice dinner. At face value, the ambiance seemed to hint that it was a place where the server would seat you, but there was no server at front, so I just flagged one down (which will shortly be the theme of the evening, little did I know) and asked to be seated with menus. There were very few people in the restaurant at the time, perhaps only 4 other tables. The lighting and art on the wall suggested a romantic setting, but there was weird rock music playing on the speakers. That, plus one of the waiters throwing chairs around while rearranging a seating area after a dinner party created a really amateur and confusing environment.

My date ordered a salad and a prosciutto pizza, and I ordered a prix-fixe meal. I told the waiter that I wanted the soup, the mushroom chicken risotto, and creme brule. He told me he'll ask about the dessert later for reasons completely unknown. It seemed strange and unprofessional, but I went along with it. I also ordered a coffee. Ten minutes later, there was no food or coffee. I flagged down a waitress and she managed to get my coffee within a second. It tasted like nescafe, but at least it was bottomless. Eventually, the food arrived. The soup was alright, and the salad (balsamic/olive oil green salad with bell peppers) was quite good. It was promising! But then, our waters and coffee were not being refilled while I watched two other tables have theirs refilled. I tried to flag one of the waiters down but I think he missed me. I was considering racism or sexism at this point, but after observing the tables, I just realized the waiters (the male ones, the only female one there was actually capable and was quick to help us) were just terrible inattentive. They aren't very good at paying attention to the needs of each table. It was incredibly irritating and time consuming. I managed to get some water after a while of trying to flag people down. 

The main course arrived and it was hilarious. I've never seen a risotto so ornamented with enormous chunks of stuff. I wish I had a camera on hand to show you. There were huge pieces of dry chicken, large pieces of pretty tasty asparagus and lots of mushrooms and a pile of unpleasant rice. The risotto base tasted like Campbell's mushroom soup, lightly flavoured by some of the more exotic mushrooms they added in later. It tasted like each element of this risotto was cooked separately, allowed to cool, then merged together haphazardly without time to marry the flavours. It was a failure, but at least I got a laugh out of it. Oh, and the prosciutto pizza was alright. Forgettable, I suppose.

After another 10 minutes of waiting around for the waiters to get rid of the empty plates, someone finally comes up and gives me a dessert menu for the prix-fixe. Considering that there were only four items in that section, I thought they would come up within 5 minutes to ask me what I wanted. 15 minutes pass by and still no sign. There are only 4 other tables here. Where are the staff? Oh, they're behind me near the kitchen, talking and laughing. At this point, I'm getting fed up, I just want to leave since I've been in this restaurant for an hour and a half at this point, and most of it was waiting around for stuff. Finally after my date flags down a guy, he says to wait a minute and he disappears to do a bunch of math. Now his inefficiency begins to boggle my mind. Getting a single order and then depositing this order to the chef while doing the bills would be much more efficient than making the table wait longer for him to come back, give the order to the chef, then wait again for the the chef to make the dessert, and then deposit the food at the table. This dinner was like death by a thousand inefficient cuts. So eventually we get a hold of him again and ask for the food and the bill at the same time. If he's not going to parallelize processes then goddammit, I will request that he does! Anyway, we get the creme brule, and the brule is too thick and hard, and the custard is alright. Not worth the wait. We paid and got the hell out of there, no less than 2 hours after our arrival.

If they want to be a fine-ish dining restaurant, they need to step up their staff and management. I would rather have eaten at McDonalds, and that place makes me puke. But at least the eating and puking fiasco would take less than 2 hours.

TL;DR: We were looking for a nice spot to have a semi-romantic dinner. I was looking for a tasty risotto. We got neither. Terrible food, inattentive and slow servers (except that one girl, you go lady, and good luck to you!), weird ambiance. Avoid it, bro."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Every time my partner and I have gone, the meals are ALWAYS excellent. They seem to do it all really well. The place isn't anything fancy, but the food speaks volumes. Also, the wait staff are always excellent. 
The place is usually pretty quiet, so its a nice intimate setting."}
{"text":"I had dinner with three friends at Sambucas on Church Street and we all tried the Fixed Price Menu for one of the better deals on Church Street in the Village. We started with salad for Cynthia, Soups for Tony and Andre and I had The Steamed Mussels in a curry sauce. For our Entrées we tried the Salmon, the 10 oz Black Angus Steak, the Apple Chicken and the Chicken Parmigiana. For desert we chose Tiramisus or Tartufos and they were a perfect finish to a delicious and very satisfying meal. We shared a bottle of white wine and with a generous tip it came to $45 each. Defiantly can't go wrong here with a beautiful décor (especially the pictures / paintings on the walls), leisurely atmosphere and pleasant efficient service."}
{"text":"I really can't be bothered with this place anymore. I'm tired of the bitchy attitude from their wait staff, and one waiter in particular, who is a bit too familiar. And do NOT show me that attitude and get pissy with me when I bring in a group of 8 for dinner. I don't care if you're busy  You should be jumping through hoops for a large party, not giving me attitude.

It's really too bad because the food isn't bad."}
{"text":"Just went here with my husband for Summerlicious. The menu looked good, but overall we felt the execution was pretty clumsy. 

For appetizers we got arancini and leek soup. The soup was okay, but the arancini were cold in the middle. For the main course I got the shrimp and lobster fettucine -- the lobster was overcooked, and tough to cut up with my butterknife (but why do I have to cut things in my pasta anyway?). The shrimp still had their tails, so I had to fish around and get my hands greasy removing them. The flavour of the pasta was okay, if not a bit oily. My husband ordered the swordfish, which was strangely soggy in the middle and came with flavourless steamed veggies. For dessert I ordered the creme brulee (even though they brought me the cheesecake). My husband ordered deep fried tiramisu out of curiosity...and what he got was basically a giant burrito stuffed with tiramisu. It was difficult to cut (with a steak knife!) and difficult to eat. 

We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Took the family based on positive Yelp reviews.  Food and service were very good. Price set menu is a great value.  Had the mussels, lamb and cream brûlée.  All were awesome and portion size was generous. Definitely recommend the cream brûlée to end the meal. ...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great prix fixe menu for $25 and a la carte. Definitely worth checking out. Been here probably 20x"}
{"text":"Have gotten take out three times and let me tell you the food is knock your socks off good. The chicken tettrazini is to die for. Fresh ingredients prepared well. Really a hidden gem and I will go back."}
{"text":"I've been in Toronto for a few weeks now and have had to eat out most nights.

I have to say that my dining experience here was very good and one of the best in the time that I have been here.  

I shared a grilled vegetable salad as well as a pizza and it was absolutely delicious.

Everything was very fresh.

I hope you have a similar experience."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the terrible waiter we had tonight. Major mistakes on his part yet not even a modicum of feeling apologetic. Very disappointed. Normally I would pass it off as an off night but this is the second time the service was uncaring and lacklustre."}
{"text":"So I have been to Sambuca 3x. First time, got the prix fixe me and my girl. Food was delicious. A dude waited on us and he was lovely as well. Second experience was good too, portions are pretty big. Very good deal. Food is not amazing but its not shitty either. The mussels are the highlight of my meal. My girl got a steak, nothing phenomenal. 
3rd visit was TERRIBLE. Food was cool. The asian lady who was waiting on us was RUDE. Basically it was one of those, I am slightly broke but I want to go out to dinner, so let me go here for the prix fixe
. So tab was around 50$ and we dropped 3$ for tip( I know cheap but one those days broke times). She came to our table and said \"hey guys, was the service bad or something?\" , I was so shocked. We responded with so much embarrassment and said no service was ok. she was then slamming our dishes as she was picking them up....huffing and puffing all angry.
Terrible"}
{"text":"I've been in to Sambucas before and was happy with the place overall. However, I was just in there this past Sat. night (Oct 1, 2011) with my boyfriend, and was not impressed. The food was good, so no complaints there. It was the service. The girl server we had was not friendly. First of all, when we entered the restaurant and asked for a table for 2, she walks away from us without saying anything, takes 2 menus and walks over to a table without even asking us to follow her. And then looks at us with this look on her face like 'well?'. It was so strange. Then, tables around us were being served who sat down after us, and were just sitting there wondering what the heck is going on. We're nice people too, no attitude from either of us. It was all so weird, as if we did something wrong. 

When she came back to now take our order, there was no apology for having us wait so long, nothing. Anyway, throughout the rest of the dining event at Sambucas, our waitress had a more forced frendly way about her. It was all so unnecessary because my boyfriend and I were friendly the whole time. She had this attitude about her for no reason whatsoever. 

I noticed another table throughout the evening was being neglected by her too. And badly enough that one of the patrons had to go to the bar and ask for his drink order. I noticed how friendly he asked the bartender (or another waiter), and how rude the waiter's response was back. The waiter was very abrupt and wouldn't even look at the patron.

So overall, even on a busy night, there is NO need to be rude to your customers. And offer an apology if they are waiting a long time. That goes a long way. I won't go back in there as long as that female waitress is there. She gave me such a negative feeling right from the beginning. She was so unwelcoming. Makes me wonder if she has something against caucasian women, lol. And I mean every word of that!"}
{"text":"Went into this restaurant with my friends for summerlicious. We sat on the high rise part of the restaurant. Our server (Joe - long hair, skinny, white male) came over, does not look very pleasant and did not give a good vibe (seems rude first impression). Gave us our drink. Restaurant was half empty. We gave him a wave to indicate we're ready to order whenever he's ready. He walked over and said if he's on the other side of the restaurant, we cannot just wave at him and expect him to come over. Stating that he's very busy. I said \"I'm sorry. we didn't mean to rush you, just to let you know we are ready to order.\" Ok took our order. His face looked pissed. At the same time, there's another table sat next to us with a different server. Lucky them. Had a very nice server. Anyways. We waited for a bit, got our starter. Finished, waited 45 mins and still no main course. Our Server was ignoring us, can't get his attention, I kindly asked the server serving the table next to us to call our server and explained that we've been waiting for our food for almost an hour. After our server (Joe) got the message, he looks more pissed, came over to us. I simply asked him \"I know you guys can get busy, but does it usually take an hour between started and main?\" He rolls his eyes and said he is not responsible for that and stated he does not know what's going on in the kitchen and that's not his business. I mean this guy does not have simple 
manner to apologize for the wait time. Could have just said he will check for us to see what's going on in the kitchen. Rather than blaming the kitchen guys and said it's not his fault. This server's comment also reflected badly on the restaurant. He goes away and grab our food. Possibly sitting on the counter for a while. Also at this time the restaurant was full. Almost everyone else is eating. The table next to us already eating dessert and we're still waiting for our main we sat down around the same time. This is ridiculous. After our main. My friend and I went to the bathroom. Came back found dessert already dropped off on the table. So he doesn't have to talk to us again.  From this point the server did not say any word to us. It's like someone giving u the silent treatment. And lastly for my drink. He got me the wrong drink and I was too mad to deal with another issue with this guy. I know it's not gonna go anywhere. When we ask him to get the bill, roll his eyes on us again and did not even talk to us again, just toss us the bill and take the money and left.  I was very disappointed at this experience. The food was good. But we did not enjoy it at all. We were very frustrated and angry. I will not want to experience this ever again."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and finally got around to writing them a review. To get to the point, Sambucas has the best food on all of Church Street. The $25 prix fix meal is definitely worth it. The portions are humongous, I had enough to pack home for lunch the next day! 

For the appetizer I had the mussels and it was basically a full meal, big and juicy with an amazing sauce! 

For the main entree, I always have the chicken parmigiana. It is really tender and the piece of chicken is huge. I highly recommend it, at this point my stomach was going to explode.

I picked Creme brûlée for dessert and it was a bit dry but not bad at all.

Now for the bad: I don't recommend cocktails here. I had a bloody casaer and it was way too spicy but the waiter noticed that i was chugging water and offered to make me a new one.

Though the service may be a bit slow because they only have one or two waiters at a time, it's definitely worth it considering how good the food is.

Will definitely be back! Too bad I don't live downtown anymore :("}
{"text":"We came in today for Winterlicious. The food was wonderful, good service and a great value. We ate off the $18 lunch menu. I had the soup of the day which was creamed cauliflower and blue cheese. It came in a large pasta size bowl and was good. A nice consistency with just a faint blue cheese taste. My son had the pear and marsipone cheese crustini. It was quite sweet, almost dessert like. He felt that it would have been better with a goat cheese to cut the sweetness but he enjoyed it anyways.
For our mains, I had the pork schnitzel which was tender and flavourful. My son declared his stuffed chicken as the best chicken he had ever had. 
For dessert I had the lemon tart. The pastry was a bit hard to cute but the filing was a heavenly tart wonder. My son had the white chocolate lava cake. A bit too rich for me but he simply loved it.
The wait staff was very attentive and we will return."}
{"text":"The breakfast is by far the best than most, comes with fruit, salad and a better take on home fries. Good quality pizza. Could use more draft beer but it is more on the wine side. Over all the menu has great items. And service has been usually great."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious with my friends, and I had a great time. The food was good, had the PI mussels, stuffed chicken breast with vegetables, and creme brûlée. The drink I ordered the Jolly Rancher; it was average. The mussels were really delicious especially in a creamy sauce, the chicken breast was gigantic and seasoned well, however the vegetables, especially the beets were not that tasty. The creme brûlée was below average, not garnished at all, and tasted very plain. 

The service was good, a bit slow when the restaurant got busy; it seems a bit understaffed. The staff themselves were friendly, and our server was nice enough to change our desserts from the winterlicious menu to the regular menu. The restaurant itself could use some interior decorating as the chairs and tables make you feel like you're at a diner.  

I would definitely come back here as the menu has a variety of options and portions are big. Would like to try the steak next time."}
{"text":"Service rapide, plats qui nourrissent bien et qui sont bons (nous avions pris un risotto et une pizza) pour un prix raisonnable. :)"}
{"text":"recently i went to sambucas for a party, 30 people

i felt that i would definately come here again, which i actually am."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!   Huge menu with great food (had Liver and Onions and Apple Chicken) and very reasonable prices. 
Relaxed environment with excellent wait staff.   Outstanding overall experience!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here for my birthday. Just myself and my partner. We ordered off the fixed price 3 course menu. The good was awesome, as a starter I had the mussels and there was a ton!  He had the soup of the day (potato leek) and it was delicious. As a main I had a pepper stake it was really nice but every so often i had a chair taste. Some like that... I'm not a fan. Dev had chicken parmesan he loved it but I thought the chicken was a bit dry. The fresh stemmed veggies were excellent! And the hole plate was pipping hot, a sine that it had no time sitting around. Good mains all in all.  We then had a coffee and on to dessert. I had a tiramisu that was quite big fir me but really one of the best desserts i have ever had, i ate the hole thing. Dev had creme brûlée it was also quite big but really excellent. Our server remembered my name each time and was very attentive. I had a wonderful birthday dinner and all of this was only $25.00 each!! :D"}
{"text":"Warm greetings here. Impressed that the basic menu is offered but every Thursday they change the specials. Which is rarely seen in establishments. The cuisine is Italian. Pizza can be made to order (ie no Cheese) and take out if you want. Prompt and friendly staff. Liked the grilled red peppers in the garden salad. Nice touch with the goat cheese. Everyone liked their entree. T-Bone was a little tough and I asked for it medium. Otherwise, liked food. Desserts were good too. Joshua was an amazing server he just busted it! Great service."}
{"text":"Very good food and great price. Going here for years, and love it every time. T-bone is amazing as well as the chicken parm. I can never finish my meal. Sometimes the waiters arent that special, but I keep going for the food. Be sure to ask for the combine menu. Its a great deal !"}
{"text":"Middle of the road dining, not a place I would go typically, but I have friends that like it so when they want to go, I go. The portions are ample and the price is ok.  I don't like to rate a place based on portion size, but I would have to say this is their best attribute. If you are hungry, not too fussy and want lots of food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Sambuca's is a three and a half star restaurant. It's not amazing but its a place I come back to often; its dependable. It's a no attitude restaurant that offers home-cooked-style meals. I've tried multiple dishes but the one that I prefer the most is the grilled chicken risotto. It's a hearty dish with fresh ingredients prepared on the spot. The menu is extensive and offers a variety of pasta dishes, pizzas and chicken entrees. It's not the type of restaurant that screams hip, trendy or excellent but its a place I always find myself considering a plan B. Good food, great service and a nice selection of wine & martinis. You can't really go wrong with Sambucas. 

Side note: This restaurant is never packed. I think one reason for it not being a popular spot on Church Street is the crowd; the demographic for this restaurant is 50 plus. Not a negative, just an observation. I'm not ageist but every visit feels like a retirement home dinner. As I mentioned it's an attitude-free restaurant, so maybe that's what draws the old queens."}
{"text":"Wow, what can i say, this place blew me away, their food wasn't just \"good\" or \"tasty\", their food was f'ing amazing, absolutely amazing, delicious food, the fresh loaf of bread was sooo good, and the pasta dishes were perfectly prepared, and so darn good, you can clearly see they really care about their food, portions were great. It was a really nice surprise stumbling across this place. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Sambucas on Church delivers every time; a true gem in the neighborhood. 

I've never been disappointed with the service or food. You might not expect such high quality food from the prices on the menu but believe be--this is good! As a vegetarian, I am happy with the selection. And, they have THE BEST FRENCH TOAST in Toronto. On the weekends, you can get a yummy fresh waffle topped with a scoop of ice cream. The grilled pear and brie salad is absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"Close by to Wellesley station and easily accessible, we thought why not try it out for winterlicious? Right away, the servers were sweet and attentive, and there were plenty of tables available for dinner (granted it was a Monday at 5pm). Ordered the Caesar salad, rib steak and lava cake, $28. All absolutely delicious. That sauce with the rib steak ... Mmm absolutely scrumptious and I was stuffed! They have a prix fix menu for $28 on regular (non- winterlicious) days, so if you don't have a chance to visit before it ends, you can always try out a similar prix fix menu any other time."}
{"text":"Good food. Great portion. Good price.
Lunch menu is especially great. 
Dinner is good as well.
I have taken people from different ethnic background and they all liked the place."}
{"text":"Last dinner for summerlicious for 2017.
Enjoyed the atmosphere for the restaurant. Service was great.

Got a plate of mussels, steak & lobster, and a chocolate tartufo for dessert.

Nice big plate of mussels, in a wonderful sauce.
Steak was a bit chewy. Excellent mashed potato.
Tartufo was tasty. A great way to end the meal.

Would definitely come back to try items on their regular menu."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and the service was okay.

I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. The meatballs looked and tasted like frozen President's Choice meatballs, they definitely were not made in the restaurant and the sauce tasted like jarred spaghetti sauce. For the price, I definitely expected more. 

Really was not impressed."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this was my first food experience in Toronto. Luckily it's been a lot better since!

My friend and I walked in for dinner after a long walk around Toronto on a fairly hot day at 4:15...not quite a busy time for any restaurant--there were three other tables with a total of 11 other patrons when we came in. We waited a few minutes and were seated in the hot sun (even though we were obviously dripping from our jaunt around town). The waitress pointed at a table, said I'll seat you here, and left without a chance for me to ask to move. When she hadn't returned in about 7 minutes, I went up to her by the bar and asked to be moved. She obliged, but with a bit of an attitude, even though we'd be closer to her \"holding position\" behind the bar. Another few minutes elapsed before she headed toward us--I thought it was to ask for our drink order--but she bypassed our table and went to go gather her tip and clean up at another table. Once that was done, she finally stopped back by the table and asked if we'd like anything to drink. She did rush back with our drinks, but only because another table was waving her down to pay and leave. She did come back quite a bit later for our dinner order.

Now to the good...my stuffed chicken breast--a special of the day--was deliciously prepared. My friend's pasta was good, but nothing extra special. Our food was done fairly quickly, but once again our waitress was too busy texting other phone to pick it up and deliver it...we ended up getting served by the other waiter even though we weren't at his table. My friend by this time had run out of soda, and was trying to get her attention for another, but the waitress never came back over to the table or checked on us during the meal. We finally got her attention again as she walked by to go to another table, and asked for another Sprite. She said ok, then rushed off. My friend had finished his dinner before she passed by 8 minutes later but still hadn't brought the drink. He reminded her and she said \"We don't give refills.\" We hadn't even said the word 'refill,' just asked for another Sprite. After we said that's ok, we finally got that drink.

Maybe this place needs a no cell phone policy like a lot of restaurants in the States have had to implement.

So, overall. The food gets a 3* rating, and the service gets a zero. Since restaurants are more about food, I'll average it up to a 2..."}
{"text":"How do I describe my experience here lately?  Well after being a regular for many years, my most recent trip was my last. First they had one person running the front of the house who could care less if you were a paying customer (these are the ones that expect a tip).  After he threw our menus at us which spilled my friends water, he came by took our orders. My friend asked for a modification (as it was previously on the prix fixe menu earlier) which they have always accompanied. So we left. 

The waiter made no effort to keep us as customers and ran behind the bar to sip his diet coke. I think he must have worked for Rogers at some point in time. Guess I won't be returning until they get more staff and someone who has a bit better customer service. Remember we pay your tips based on service. It's not something you just get."}
{"text":"A real disappointment. I could understand time that it takes to prepare complex dishes, some chops, some seafood creations. But this is a simple pasta place, and the waits were interminable! How long did it take to get the evening special, which was a ridiculously simple chicken and mushroom mix on a bed of fettuccini? How about 30 minutes from the moment I ordered it? 

Worth the wait? Hardly. The sauce was unseasoned, the pasta overcooked (ok, that makes sense), the chicken honestly tasted like was warmed up and not grilled at that moment. I had to keep adding salt and pepper to give it something. Then at the end, all the sauce thinned out at the bottom, leaving an unfortunate pool which should have been thicker during the preparation.

The carrot ginger soup that was the appetizer wasn't much better. Again, the barely visible sprinkle of parsley didn't do much to add any taste, because once again the soup was redolent of anything but carrots or ginger. I don't know what it was --probably something concocted with a little splash of Progresso.

I didn't even bother with the \"homemade\" desserts, which were on a list as I made it to the back to the restrooms at the end. I just couldn't do it. The best thing is that it's convenient there on Church St., and it was pretty cheap. Service was just OK. Oh, and could someone please lose the loud (for this kind of restaurant) house music and the high BPM thumping?"}
{"text":"We had meals from the prix fixe menu. The salad was crisp and fresh with goat cheese. The tomato dill soup was flavorful but the dill was quite subtle. The entrees were plentiful and delicious. The Spanish paella included 9 mussels surrounding the rice, chicken, shrimp, sausage and mushrooms. The Angus steak was cooked to order with a nice seasoning on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes.
Dessert was a pleasant surprise. The chocolate lava cake had a white vanilla creamy center. The creme caramel was quite good, very similar to a Mexican flan."}
{"text":"With Summerlicious prix fixe meals, I never expect anything above decent.  What I've always gotten in the past were dishes that were \"child-size\", albeit presented in large plates/bowls.  The quality of food was also always debatable, because sometimes you would get dishes that feel as if they were pre-made hours before, dishes that were hashed together using smaller amounts of spices/seasoning, dishes that were sloppily presented, and so forth.  Notwithstanding my hesitation, Sambucas' Summerlicious dinner menu was well-received!

I visited with a Scarborough meet-up group and we were seated at the back.  The servers were all very responsive, polite, and amiable.  The interior design seems to capture both intimacy and the everyday, with its predominantly brick walls, dim lighting, and the white tablecloths with standard silver cutlery.  What really adds flavour to the interior design though is the plethora of art pieces from diverse styles that hang from the walls.  I am very appreciative of restaurants that put effort into their interior decor.  It adds to the experience, and Sambucas did a quality job on this criteria.

For my Summerlicious bundle, I ordered:

- Mussels as my appetizer: 

Sambucas' chefs don't skimp out.  My entire table ordered the mussels and each of us received a plate that was mountain-topped!  The mussels were well-cooked; they were neither too raw nor overcooked.  The sauce was delectable with its coconut base that was combined with various herbs and diced tomatoes.  By contract, many mussel platters that I've ordered at other Italian restaurants often came with a tomato-based sauce instead.  I'm not exactly a fan of cooked tomatoes and I'm quite a devout coconut-lover, so this appetizer was both delicious and aromatic!  This was my personal favourite of the night and would have enjoyed it as my appetizer, entree, and even dessert!

- Swordfish as my entree:

Many of my colleagues ordered the Steak and Lobster. Heck, for an affordable price of $28 dollars (for a 3 course meal), I would assume most would jump on that bandwagon.  I, however, don't exactly have a penchant for steak, so I opted for a fish that I don't commonly come across.  Personally, I think I got the jackpot of the night  because, while my colleagues were complaining about the toughness of their \"medium-done\" steaks and chewy lobster meat, I thoroughly enjoyed my dish!  The swordfish was grilled and then subtly softened by a white sauce that seemed very similar to tartar sauce with extra cream/coconut and herbs.  It came with half a lemon to add a citrus zing to the meat, but I found that it worked well without it.  Additionally, the texture was not tough nor too soft.  It was firm and held well on its own, unlike halibut and other fishes you often find at general fish and chips joints.  Sambucas really likes to load you up on their sauces by the way.  For some dishes (like the veal), the volume of sauce is excessive, but for the swordfish entree, it was perfect, as it helped to flavour the rice and vegetables hiding underneath the large slab of fish.  I can't say too  much about the carrots, green beans, and rice that accompanied the fish.  They were just standard fillers, but the fish was well-portioned and masterfully cooked.

- Rhubarb Tart as my dessert:

I am not a chocolate enthusiast, so I opted for the tart instead of the usual tartufo that my colleagues ordered instead.  I enjoy berry-based desserts, so rhubarb was a good alternative.  The crust on the tart was not too thick and the overall taste of the dessert was excellent.  It was sweet, but not overpoweringly so because the sweetness was accompanied by a subtle sour undertone, which I enjoyed.  Topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, the dessert was well-packaged.  The only caveat was that it came lukewarm. I really love getting my crumbles/tarts steaming hot so that it would meld better with the vanilla ice cream on the side. 

Holistically-speaking, Sambucas provided me with the best Summerlicious experience that I've had so far. The interior decor, food, presentation, and service were all great.  The portion size was up an ante compared to other Summerlicious restaurants because you can certainly end your night with a full belly here.  I highly recommend coming here for any Summerlicious/Winterlicious deals and will be frequenting it myself in the winter."}
{"text":"I've had eventful experiences that weren't as bad as my experience at Sambuca's on Church. 
As the name suggests I was super excited to try their Winterlicious lunch to the extent that I made reservations and couldn't wait for a much awaited Friday lunch.
Upon reaching the restaurant we were greeted by a host and was told that my name was not on the list which means they didn't enter my reservation details.
Furthermore I was told that I'd have to wait for another 50 mins or so for a table, to which I decided to do a take out instead.
So I ordered a soup, seafood risotto and Tiramisu to go. 
My friend ordered a seafood salad. 
We realized that a take out shouldn't take that long.
After a good amount of time our orders arrived and in spite of giving separate orders they added everything in one bag which was still ok. So when we went aside to segregate 
our orders we noticed our dessert and plastic cutlery were missing. That's not the end of it. When the time came to pay for our bills they did not charge us separately and put everything on one tab and were super busy to amend it .
I have dined at numerous restaurants during rush hours and never have I came across such an experience so appalling that it failed to match Toronto standards."}
{"text":"Nice, intimate restaurant specializing in Italian food. Great decor and service  gives this place a good rating. Prices tend to be a bit high, but as the only Italian restaurant in the Village area, this makes it one of the few non-commercial eateries located on this busy street."}
{"text":"Well my review is kind of odd ....I will say that this restaurant is 5 stars all the way and the food is AMAZING. But I'm a little miffed with the management. The servers are always outstanding. 

I'm hoping the restaurant management reads this !! ......I am made a reservation for 13 people for Sunday December 22 at 6:30. Arrived a few minutes early where I was informed that the manager just now (at 6:10) advised the server that a party of 13 was coming in and one more server will be starting at 6:30. 
Our party all arrived and we were all seated. 
We were given menus and water. Took about 20-30 minutes before the server was able to get to us to take our drink orders because by that point the restaurant of about another 15 tables was FULL!!  The servers were hustling like crazy in top speed, but not for us.....They turned all the tables in the restaurant twice before our entrées arrived. In fact one of our guests had to leave as after waiting 2 hrs before the entree was served. Once the food arrived, it was absolutely delicious !! We all had something different and everyone enjoyed their meal. I will say because the servers were to slammed with customers but drinks we're not flowing. We would have spent allot more money on cocktails and wine  if we could even get the servers attention as he was so busy with all the other tables. 

All in all it was great to see my friends at the holidays and the meal was wonderful, but the manager should"}
{"text":"After a good meal from the \"prix fixe\" menu.  Paired with cocktails and wine...I had to walk up to the bar as if I just had my meal in a cafeteria to pay my bill with my credit card?  Which one of these doesn't belong?  Get a mobile terminal please or I won't come back!"}
{"text":"The prix fix is great value and very generous portions. Enjoyed the food and the service."}
{"text":"Hidden gem among the plethora of pasta places in downtown. Been here over 5 times. Though at times service may be a little slow, the food is great and keeps me coming back for more. Good place for a casual gathering with friends or for date night."}
{"text":"Graphic, violent art with a strong anti-Israel message really bothered me. It was all over the brick wall. It's a restaurant for goodness sake. Thank G-d I didn't bring anyone I professionally know there. I won't chance it again, back to Cafe California for lunches for this reviewer......

Apart from this, food is a solid 7/10 and has been consistent for years."}
{"text":"The place was ridiculously understaffed on a Tuesday night - one waitress and no bartender for around 10 occupied tables. The poor lady had to do two jobs at once and serve a big number of people. Because of that the wait times were long, and the quality of service was bad - management should plan their staffing better. I had the stuffed chicken. It was regular - nothing particularly exciting."}
{"text":"I have to catch up on one last review for places I have recently enjoyed...

This one was a little hard for me to rate; I am sure my friend would give it a 4, but it wasn't as good overall as my other 4-star restaurants, so would really give it a 3.5.

My friend had been trying to take me to Sambuccas for a while to try their $25 Prix-Fixe menu which apparently includes the best crème brulee, so we eventually went on a Sunday evening in June. The restaurant itself was nice enough, upscale-casual, not too loud or bright. The service was okay, but the server was a little hard to find at times.

The prix-fixe menu had a wide selection, and the food was generally good. I started with PEI mussels in cream sauce, which were very good, and my friend had the mixed salad. For entrees I had risotto with grilled chicken and mushrooms, and my friend had the Spanish paella. We both agreed that the risotto was the better choice, although I also tried some paella which was okay. For dessert, she of course had the crème brulee and I had the chocolate lava cake, both of which were fine. With drinks, the bill was about $75 for two people. Entrees on the regular menu vary from about $12-20."}
{"text":"we went on a wednesday after work for a co-worker's goodbye dinner. we had a really good time. 

the prix-fixe menu was $25 and the portions are enormous. i had the mussels, lamb shank, and the tiramisu. mussels are cooked with curry which was a bit interesting, i usually have them with white wine or tomato sauce... the lamb shank was actually very tender and yummy, i only had two bites cuz i was talking too much and the mussels filled me up quite a bit already. the tiramisu was very good and huge - i ate it all. i had the lamb for lunch the next day.

other things our party got and gave good reviews are the veal parmesan, salmon, steak, burgers, and pizza. the spanish paella was just.. okay.

the waiter was really nice and we were able to get bill split altho there was like 20 of us in the group."}
{"text":"Here the food is dependably ordinary and the service, while friendly, is less consistent.  Don't take offense if your waiter puts on his coat and walks out the front door before you complete your meal.  That's how things work here when there's a shift change.  Given the lackluster food, rising prices and quirky service, I will probably give this place a pass next time."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and it was delicious! Tried the penne special. It was fresh and portions were great."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite places for pasta. Although there are many places to eat on Church street and in the Village ... the others are pretty much burger joints.  This is the only place for decent dining. I would recommend calamari to start and Piscatore as your main. Bon appetite."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend.  She was starving and ordered the summerlicious menu.  I didn't want to eat as much so I was happy that they had their regular menu as well.  This place was super busy, so we figured it was a good spot.

The service was friendly and informative.  He told us that the portions were pretty big, and he was right.  I ordered the caprese salad.  It was delicious and not over dressed (which I find often happens).

My friend got the mussels to start.  I'm not a fan, so I didn't try them but she said they were really good.  Next she had the trout.  I did have a piece of that, which was delicious with the mango salsa.  For dessert she let me split her pineapple upside cake with her.  The waiter recommended it and it did not disappoint.  It came out warm, was not too sweet and just melted in your mouth.  

I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Went here just last week for summerlicious lunch. Place was not super busy but service was just so so, not the best. Waiters seem very busy, not that patient or friendly. It doesn't seem organized to in terms of how the staff work is coordinated. Food was just ok,I have had better. I would not come back . Overall I would give this place as 7/10 due to mediocre service from waiters. I would rather go to another place like Red Midtown Tavern close by for summerlicous at Yonge/Gerrard as food quality, taste and service is much better for the same price for summerlicious lunch."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting Sambucas for Winterlicious 2015 for dinner. Glad I made a reservation as it was quite busy the night of. They were very accommodating especially for my party of 6 people. Courteous staff who were extremely helpful in making choices.
I was simply blown away by the appetizer, which really looked like a main course! The PEI mussels were cooked very well and the sauce to accompany was excellent. 
Main course was the rack of lamb which was again cooked to perfection at my request (medium) and was seasoned very well. 
Dessert however was a tease! With a chocolate and nutty nutella cake in a shallow pool of creme anglaise, I was craving even more! 
Overall an excellent atmosphere for dinner, great food all for $25 (around 30 with ax) puts Sambucas in my top 5 fav Winterlicious restaurants."}
{"text":"I was upset that a waiter tried to take advantage of us; it ruined what would have been a good night.

I went here for Winterlicous and ordered a Long Island ice tea.  The waiter brought me Coke in a high ball glass; there was clearly no alcohol. I alerted the waiter to the mistake, but he said he made it himself and it was fine. So I left it full on the table for the duration of the meal (the food was edible, like a red lobster or Swiss chalet).  At the end of the meal, the waiter avoided our table for half an hour clearly foreseeing that I would request to speak with the manager. Apparently the manager wasn't in (likely..) but I could speak with one of the cooks who's worked there for a while.  So I did, and he concluded based on the fact that the colour of the liquid in my glass was very dark that I was not drinking a Long Island ice tea.  My drink was refunded, but it's concerning that the same waiter still works there.. (I pass by sometimes and see him inside)."}
{"text":"Sambucas is great. Winterlicious, summerlicious, and any day in between! You truly get the most bag for your buck here so you don't ever feel like you've made a wrong decision.  Sambucas is always right.  I've been here with friends and family.  Great atmosphere and enough space between tables so you're not rubbing elbows with a stranger. Service is always incredibly friendly and attentive. Also, they have one of my favourite creme brulee's in the city!  Must try."}
{"text":"What an amazing find! I wasn't very hungry when a friend & I decided to come here for dinner, so I ordered the \"magic mushrooms\" & a Caesar salad, my friend ordered the crab cakes. The dressing on the Caesar was delicious, and the crab cakes were the best I've tasted in a long, long time but the magic mushroom crostinis were HEAVENLY... creamy, crunchy & all around yummy. I look forward to going back to sample the rest of their menu.
The service here leaves a little to be desired; they only had 2 people working at dinner time! Our waiter was often rushed as he was handling quite a few other tables, so he might have been a little friendlier..."}
{"text":"I went there to try their summerlicious dinner. It was $28 for the 3-course dinner which included appetizer, main course and dessert. I selected PEI mussels, steak and lobster tail, and Tartufo as my three courses. The mussels were very fresh and there was no empty shell in my bowl. The steak was so huge and rare cooked. It was so juicy and no bloody taste. But the lobster tail was so tiny and the meat was so fragile which seemed like not quite fresh. Tartufo is a traditional Italian dessert which was made me feel satisfied for the whole meal! I can't complain anything on the dessert. 

Each portion was huge and I think it is worth to try! I will recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"Love brunch here! They also have great daily specials. Great value and solid food!"}
{"text":"We REALLY should have read the most recent reviews on Sambucas before swinging by. I came with my wife, son and daughter. We decided on Sambucas after shortlisting it down from 10 other restaurants taking part in Summerlicious based on its offering for its prix fixe. The swordfish grabbed my son's attention so we chose Sambucas.

The dinner didn't really get off to a good start as the bread was dry and crumbly. 

For appetizers, we had the arancinis with mushrooms and salad. The arancinis were alright though nothing fancy. The salad had a nice dressing to it.

For the mains, we had the (1) swordfish, (2) grilled sirloin, (3) shrimp & lobster fettuccine and (4) risotto. Let's proceed from best to worst. The risotto was cooked very well and was flavourful. Of the 4 kinds of entrees we ordered, this was by far the best. Definitely would be nice in the Fall or Winter! The next best was the swordfish. It was cooked okay, right on point. It was accompanied by steamed vegetables which were nicely done. The shrimp & lobster fettuccine was okay but the pasta was definitely on the hard side. I like pasta \"al dente\"....and this was harder than al dente for sure! Furthermore, it was dry as it lacked any sauce. The sirloin really bad! It was ordered as rare (I was shooting for medium rare) and it came out medium well. Since it was a long wait, I didn't ask for it to be returned and re-done. But it was really chewy and even with a steak knife, it was rather hard to cut! I really can't say I was the least bit impressed by that.

Now for the piece the resistance...dessert! We ordered two deep fried tiramisu and two creme brulees. The tiramisu was actually served wrapped in a crepe (think burrito!). The tiramisu inside was borderline okay but the presentation wasn't quite our thing. The creme brulee was REALLY BAD!!! It was almost like a cross between a creme caramel (in that it was really light) and a creme brulee. But the consistency was bizarre. It was not smooth, nor was it firm. It was quite chunky...almost like a rice pudding. 

I don't know if the quality of food was so poor BECAUSE we ordered off the Summerlicious menu. If so and Sambucas was hoping we will never return, then they achieved that goal."}
{"text":"I came here for summerlicious.  The mussel appetizer was great.  It was a lot more than expected.   The main entree was a let down.  I ordered the osso boco and i believe they had it frozen.  When it came to me, the entree wasn't even hot or warm so i asked them to heat it up.   It was ok.  The sauce was too overpowering with too much peppercorn.   Also, the braised veil was dry.   The dessert was better.  Anyways,  just average."}
{"text":"Apparently I'm the only one that really liked this place.  I've been 2 times now and each time gets better.

Both times I have gone, I have ordered off the pre fix menu and I think it's a great deal.  A starter, a main and a desert...all for $25...not bad considering some of the items that are on the pre fix menu are very similar to the items on the regular menu that are about the same price but just for the main.

The amount of food is great!  Large helpings and they are very yummy.  I would recommend the Linguini with the Shrimp and calamari....but with out the calamari ;)  It's very filling.  Also their creme brulee is to die for....it's very very creamy and the crunchy top is done to perfection.

Apparently they have a great brunch...so I'll have to check that out ;)

The service has always been great, and very quick.  I have to point out that I have only been on Sunday and Monday nights....not on a typical \"dinner out night\".  The staff is also very friendly and offer great suggestions.

Location is great, the atmosphere is romantic, but the decor can use an update...."}
{"text":"A couple of friends chose this place for our summerlicious girls-date dinner, against my doubts as I wasn't particularly interested in anything off their menu.  However, majority rules; so we walk in to a rather casual setting with an open front window.  There were a few other tables taken - in the middle of the vibrant community, some families looked so confused/out-of-place that they were clearly only here because of summerlicious.

Our server was a bored-looking man whom I only caught smiling once throughout our entire evening; he didn't seem interested in his job nor all that knowledgeable about the menu.  When we asked what he recommended, he basically listed everything.  Eventually we did discover that he had a quiet humorous side, and I suppose he accomplished his job fairly well (other than attempting to pick up my friend while the other two of us went to the restroom).

We all ordered different things for our appetizers and entrees - PEI mussels, tomato soup, spinach salad; pasta, chicken, and risotto - while they got creme brulee for dessert and I went on a limb and ordered the pistachio meringue (with the server commenting that it was tiny, definitely weird, but interesting).  I wanted to substitute the desserts for something off their regular prix-fixe menu which was the same price anyway, but the server said it was no-go.  

As soon as my mussels appetizer came, my low opinion of the restaurant started to turn right around - it was a heaping plate of opened mussels smothered in creamy truffle sauce.  Although the meaty parts were rather tiny compared to the shells, the sauce was so delicious I had to stop myself spooning it all up like soup.  The other two didn't have much to say about their appetizers - pretty average, it seemed.

My chicken entree was a fist-sized piece of chicken breast with sweet chestnut stuffing - it took some getting used to, but good enough that I could finish everything on the plate.  The orange maple sauce was a special taste to note, although I am biased towards sweet things.  My friends' fettucine and risottos also came in large plates with generous portions.  By the time we finished the second course, dessert was barely manageable (especially with the amount of starch and carbs my friends already had, I'm guessing).  My experience with creme brulees at just about every other restaurant in Toronto has been this dainty little white cup with crispy burnt caramel over a yummy pudding; it wasn't much different at Sambucas - except about 4 times the surface area.  My pistachio dessert was something else altogether (the server popped it down with a \"Here you go, the meringue-y thing\")... It was literally a paperback-sized chunk of foam-looking meringue that tasted like solid cotton candy, infused with bits of whole de-shelled pistachios, capped off with a wad of whipped cream, and the entire thing drizzled in caramel sauce.  Of course, none of us were able to entirely finish our desserts.

It was certainly a different experience here; chances are I wouldn't be back, but I left with a higher respect for their food than I had coming in.  Good food, good prices - it's worth a try."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing I come for the prix fix menu as it is only 25$ for a three course meal. Our server Joshua was friendly and attentive and even sang me happy birthday I recommend the butternut squash soup and the tiramisu is so authentic ! Must try"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  They had a decent & flavourful tomato/dill soup - very satisfying.  My entree, a thin crust sausage/pepper/sundried tomato pizza was tasty.  Enough spicy kick, with flavourful tomato, however the crust was not the crunchy/cracker-like type that I prefer.  Ambience was nice, and service was prompt (granted it was a slow day).  Overall an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"We went to Sambuca's during Winterlicious 2013 with a group of 14.  The ambiance of this place is perfect for a date or a classy girls night.
The service was good, and the food was impressive.  They had a good variety and they paid attention to detail.  The drinks were a bit expensive and my particular entree was a little bland (I had the seafood linguine) but all in all I would go back."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday with a bunch of friends and tried their summerlicious menu ($25 dinner). The atmostphere was definitely cozy and calm. The waitress was very friendly as she kept asking us if we were doing okay while waiting for some friends to arrive. 

My 3 course meal included: (appetizer) Baby mixed greens, pancetta bacon, mandarin orange, roasted pistachio, blue cheese and woodapple dressing, (entree) Pan seared halibut with papaya and avocado relish, served with grilled vegetables and herb roasted potatoes, (dessert) Lemon meringue pie.

I absolutely loved the salad appetizer. The salad was fresh and full of flavor with the pistachios as the add on. The dressing was made just right; not too sour, not too sweet. It was definitely a good start. Then the entree came and the halibut was too dry (overcooked) and had no flavor to it. Another friend of mine got the same entree and also complained of the dryness. The salsa on the halibut was good, however, I wish I had more on my plate to compensate for the dryness of the fish. The grilled vegetables was too oily and had no salt or pepper on it. The potatoes were too salty for my taste. So after being disappointed with the entree, the desserts came and my lemon meringue pie was not to ratio (50 meringue: 50 lemon curd) and it was very small. 

 I was not impressed by the main course. Then comes the bill. The waitress decided that since we had over 8 people, she would charge us all on one bill, which would mean a definite service charge for her. We wanted separate bills, but she never asked. (Smart server!) 

All in all, I liked the environment and how happy my friends were, but I feel that the food was not good enough for me to go back again."}
{"text":"I would suggest Sambucas for brunch.

Great value given the quality of food and the portions.

I would suggest their Eggs Benedict, Eggs Natasha and French Toast."}
{"text":"Well 4/5 is a bit high and 3/5 is a bit low. Yelp when are you going to give us a half star option??? I'd say this joint is around a 78% if I was getting really precise. Sambucas is a time capsule. The office style drop ceiling and the interesting art work made me feel like I was transported into a friend's basement in the early 80s. Still it had some quirky charm. I ordered the smoked salmon pizza. The pizza crust was perfect and the portion was decent. I would not have ordered it though had I known that they used pesto as the sauce; I think it is too strong of a flavour and takes away from the salmon. But this is a personal preference. My friend had the chicken supreme and enjoyed it. I sampled one of the potatoes and a bite of the chicken - nothing mindblowing, but good. Our server was fun and added to the experience. Overall, it was a pleasant dinner, but I can't say I would race back when there are so many other places to explore."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner and we decided to try the prix-fixe menu at $28. There is a wide variety of choices on the menu. I started off with the salad and my boyfriend got the mussels. The mussels were in a curried broth and were probably the best thing we had that night. The salad was fresh and I like that they went light on the dressing. Entrees were just okay. My boyfriend didn't like the lamb shank much. The steak was a lower grade of meat, it was cooked to a perfect medium-rare but was a bit bland. Desserts was tiramisu and creme caramel. Not overwhelmingly sweet which I enjoyed. Our server Josh was great. He was attentive and even offered to take pictures for us. Overall I found the food mediocre but the service was great and they were able to accommodate a large group."}
{"text":"Your average casual restaurant. Nothing wrong with it except if you come in a bigger group like 15, don't go. 
Simply the restaurant cannot handle the capacity. Waitress could not deal with the extra people not accustomed to give proper customer service. With all the other options in the vicinity, its not in good competition. Also it's memorable, but for the wrong reason."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch, generous portions, good price. Only one waitress but she rocked.  Handled the whole restaurant with super efficiency.  Now that's a good eatery."}
{"text":"Excellent place for brunch on a Sunday morning.

Friends called asking us to meet in the village for brunch. We all decided on Sambucas as we've been there before and have always found the food to be fantastic.

We arrived at 11am and the place was quiet...however, by the time we left at 1ish...it was fairly busy.

Today I opted for French Toast with carmalized apples. It also came with home fries, bacon or sausage, and large slices of watermelon, cantelope, and honeydew. The French toast was amazing. Bacon cooked perfectly, home fries good...fantastic meal. Much better than the French toast I had a day earlier Symposium Cafe...although they both were the same price...$10.95.

My dining companion had Eggs Benedict. It also came with home fries and the above mentioned melons. He also said it was FAR superior to the Eggs Benny he had at Symposium Cafe the day earlier...at the same price of $10.95 as well.

Server was excellent, very friendly and welcoming. Atmosphere was warm. Great place to dine, especially if you get a window seat.

I wished I lived back in the city as this place was excellent.."}
{"text":"*This review is for their summerlicious menu but apparently they have a prix fix menu seven days a week*

First I have to say that no matter what you get, this place is definitely a great bang for your buck. For $28, you can choose an appetizer, the main course, and a dessert. I got the caesar salad, seafood risotto, and the chocolate lava cake. By the end I was incredibly stuffed and satisfied. My friend ordered the steak and lobster which I thought was going to be tiny considering the price point but the steak was huge! I took a bite and they did medium rare very well. 

I knocked off a star just because I felt like the mussels in my risotto weren't as fresh as they could've been and inside the restaurant, there was no AC so devouring a plate of piping hot risotto on a hot summer evening wasn't as pleasant as it could've been. However, the food was still delicious and definitely worth the money. I think next time I'll come just for the steak and lobster!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a Thursday evening to sample there Winterlicious offerings.

A long narrow restaurant with exposed brick walls and dark wood tables with hardwood floors.

Our waitress was very bubbly and friendly and came over to take our drink orders. We wanted something fruity and tropical. She joked and said we'd have to go the caribbean for that but she'd do her best to whip up something along those lines.
She later returned with a tall ruby red refreshing blend of grenadine, gingerale, pineapple and cranberry juice. It totally took us back to the caribbean!

From the Winterlicious menu I ordered

Crustini -Three piece crustini topped with smoked salmon and avocado mango relish 
The salmon was fresh and ample and I loved the refreshing taste of avocado and mango which totally blended well with my caribbean drink.

Filet Mignon -Pan roasted bacon wrapped filet mignon with morel mushroom red wine sauce, served with herb roasted vegetables and buttered baby bok choy
Boy oh boy did this knock my socks off! I was expecting a wee little piece of meat but out came this hunk of juicy delicious well seasoned generous cut of meat! Everything on the plate looked amazing and tasted equally delicious!

Walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream
Two Fudgey warm brownies packed with toasted walnuts with a side of vanilla ice cream and hot fudge, simple but lovely end to a fab meal!

Tea - English Breakfast by Bigalow

Overall superberb meal which totally exceeded my expectations as this was one of the cheaper winterlicious offerings however it was surprisiningly  a high quality and outstanding meal + top notch friendly service!"}
