{"text":"First of all, we would give the lemongrass soup 6 stars. But overall, the restaurant was great. It's a little easy to miss being on the second floor but, once there, it's good ambiance, good food, and best of all there is an uber d√©panneur across the street that had a huge selection of craft beer and some decent wines."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish lemongrass soup, it was delicious, not too spicy but very very flavourful. Also, the shrimp and crab pancake which was also delightful. Both were served with vermicelli and a side salad."}
{"text":"I feel this was disappointing. Nothing stood out to me in terms of food nor atmosphere. I actually found the live fish tank a bit creepy. I tried: dumplings, spring rolls, papaya beef salad, rare beef pho and caramelized fish (we were a group and shared).   Dumplings were bland and only available fried with a peanut dip sauce (I prefer steamed dumplings with vinegar based sauce). The spring rolls were fresh but nothing special. Same for the salad. The pho was actually worst than what I usually get at average pho restaurants. I didn't like the broth much. Finally, the thing I was most excited and curious about : the fish. It wasn't bad, but it was sweet - and I wish it wasn't. I bet there are some hidden gems here but I haven't gotten any. Not bad, but really really standard/slightly sub par."}
{"text":"Vietnamese food made by (lovely!) Vietnamese family. They value fresh ingredients and snappy service.  Established in 2011, this restaurant serves many traditional Vietnamese dishes as well as a few popular 'East Asian' dishes. Plates are heartily-sized and reasonably priced.  My Tom Xao Ca Ri ($12.50) was full of fresh vegetables (not overcooked -- a rarity for this neighborhood's Asian restaurants!) and jumbo shrimp. The original house specialties include Banh Tom Ho Tay (lightly friend shrimp and sweet potato cake, $13) and Ca Kho To (caramelized fish, $10). Their curries pack a welcomed spicy punch. The Canh Chua ($8) are all made with a homemade broth (cooked daily).    The chef is forthright in sharing his values. MSG disgusts him and so does the 'watery salty stock' that other restaurants use. He also said too many cooks substitute natural ingredient flavor with copious amounts of oil.   Petite Tonkinoise's only downfall? The decor isn't much to write about. It looks like a confused zen kitsch mini banquet hall."}
{"text":"I had probably the worst fish soup (canh ca) in my life. It doesn't taste anything like Vietnamese food at all with weird sweet taste combined with coconut and way too much sate. It's like a very strange and bad version of Thai tom yum.   Well, I would say the place has good ambience and service but the food is really not that good."}
