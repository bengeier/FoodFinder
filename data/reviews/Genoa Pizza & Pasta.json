{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings for delivery while staying at a nearby hotel. The pizza was so undercooked and sloppily put together it was completely inedible and ended up going straight in the trash. Even the starving kids wouldn't eat it. The wings were so small and meatless we actually laughed out loud and ended up throwing them out too. A couple in our party ate some of the breadsticks then we went out to find a meal elsewhere. We might have called to complain and tried to get replacements but the kids were not going to wait another 45 minutes and then risk getting another inedible meal. Truly THE WORST pizza and wings I've had delivered in the last 20 years. Gas station hot dogs would have been a better buy."}
{"text":"Great place if you want diarrhea the next day
Had food from them few times now to know it is this place, had pizza (which is sub par, not the worst but frozen pizza is better) gyros (most recent which woke up this morning and have to deal with diarrhea at work now) along with couple other items
Very dissatisfied with this place along with that they take long time for delivering when I know they aren't as busy as places closer to city but take longer
I won't be eating this crap again, even if someone else orders from here I would rather eat Roman noodles that way I am not sick"}
{"text":"Ordered through grubhub.com.  Was told it would be delivered within an hour and I would receive a confirmation email within 10 minutes.  Never received email after 45 minutes so I called.  Spoke with a woman who told me that the driver was leaving then.  Waited another 20 minutes.  Called again and asked her to just cancel the order.  She refused and said \"well the online people don't know how busy we are!\"  A gentleman then got on the phone and told me he was going to call the police since I refused to pay (the driver STILL wasn't here and it had been 80 minutes since the food was ordered).  I explained that I had screenshots of my order and the information.  I would NOT order from this place again."}
{"text":"Just ordered two Italian subs they were the worst I have ever had!   Four thin slices of meat with some toppings thrown on some bread then toasted Bread was about all I paid for and soggy bread at that!  Also didn't know Italian hoagie came with bologna  Sure doesn't say that on description on menu  Will not be a rerun customer for sure worst 20$ I spent."}
{"text":"I didn't feel like lvg the Hyatt Airport & I was tired of the less than stellar room service. I ordered a 10\" spinach & feta pie, fried mushrooms, mild wings & Tuscany chicken salad. The pizza wa the best thing I received & it was only fair. The crust was tasteless. The salad was a head of iceberg that was barely chopped and barely fresh. The breading in the mushrooms was like a hushpuppy :-(

The driver left my drink & I tipped him $3 bucks but he wasn't even friendly. I won't order from here again. I paid for the convenience and most of this food is going to go in the garbage! It did smell like it was going to be delicious, but it was fair at best."}
{"text":"Average at best.  The cheese and sauce didn't reach anywhere near the edge of the crust and the sauce itself was pretty bland compared to other pizza I've enjoyed in the past.  Lots of menu choices and pretty quick delivery, but not ground breaking pizza by any stretch.  The driver wasn't very friendly and dumped one of our garlic sauces for good measure.  Try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Got the calzone on delivery (45 minutes) with pepperoni. It literally poured grease out of it and I couldn't eat half of it. I know pepperoni will add grease to the calzone, but this was crazy."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service, I try to order something over the phone the woman barely speaks English it's fine though but she is rude I was explaining my order for a pick up I ordered a medium pizza and I was about to continue ordering some other stuff she was like 13.99 see you in 10 minutes and she freaking hang up on my face I don't know if she was high or something but B*** I didn't finish talking. She called me and they were about to close she was like are you going to come pick it up? I tried to explain that I didn't finish ordering and you hang up in my face that freaking B** did it again. And a week after I called them and they said they do not deliver so I had to come pick it up and when I ask when do you guys stop delivering he said after an hour so he lied to me through the phone call!! I explained what happened and I told him I didn't show up because of this because I'm not gonna show up if I'm not going to have my complete order. You guys need to work on your customer service. He said I cannot talk to him like that because that would work with Americans but he said, \"Where are Muslims we are not Americans. \" I don't know why he mentioned religion?!!!! If you owned the place that doesn't mean one of your cousins can be rude to customers. !!!!!! Anyways I try to order today 09/29/16 because they are so close to me I called and the crazy women answered and she said we cannot deliver because of what happened last time. You can come pick it up.  So do you want my money and you don't want to offer me a service I'm never ever going to order from that place again."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza loaded with sausage and pepperoni, and it was greasy goodness. I like how the topping was a little itty bit spicy...adding that perfect kick to the pizza. It came with a side of ranch and garlic dip as well, but you have to ask. The appetizer was a different story though. Do NOT get their wings...so salty and hard as a rock.

The service wasn't so great. I asked for my order to be delivered to a location that's literally 10 minutes from the pizza shop. My order took exactly 1 hour and 15 minutes to arrive. I called the shop twice to check on my order, and every time they said 5 more minutes...that additional \"5 more\" minutes turned into more than an hour wait. 

Overall, I recommend this place for their pizza only if you're desperate for some greasy pizza. It's edible, but nothing that praise worthy. Pick up if you can because their delivery service is at turtle speed."}
{"text":"I order delivery to my hotel late night I got Bacon cheese Burger with fries and raspberry cheesecake. It came pretty quick.. taste good.. nothing to write home about.."}
{"text":"I found a 50% off deal for Genoa Pizza in Moon Twp. on Local Flavor Clipper Magazine's deal site similar the Groupon. Good pizza and hoagies. A good new find."}
{"text":"In celebration of a coworker's 5th year with the company the boss ordered pizza for our department. 

If I was to rate Genoa's on pizza alone, I'd give it a 2. The pizza is loaded with cheese but greasy as a level one car mechanic after a full day of oil changes. The pepperoni was skimpy but cooked to a crisp! The slices are cut rather thinly, it would take 2 of Genoa's slices to be comparable to the average pizza joint's slice. The pizza does come with a creamy ranch dipping sauce, similar to the way Papa John's has a garlic butter sauce. 

The 3 stars is due to the fact that this place has passable sandwiches. And the prices reasonable when you get a special. For example, 2 gyros and fries for $9.69. 

I won't ever go there (even if my boyfriend begs) but will eat a slice or two if and when the boss pays again."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery. The driver called and said he was at my house and he wasn't. He got the address  wrong.  The order was completely wrong. When I told the driver. The driver called and had me talk to a man who said that he got it right. The man was trying to tell me that I ordered a Italian sandwich not a Stromboli! I will not order from there again. They are just plain RUDE!"}
