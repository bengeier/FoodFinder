{"text":"Charcoal grilled. Reasonably priced. Friendly staff.  Best grilled fish I ever had. Crispy, flavourful, perfectly cooked. Squid goes well with drinks.  Didn't like the lamb. Not fatty enough.  Felt a bit rushed as there was a big line up outside.  Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"Overall good food and not overly seasoned with cumin as most skewer places tend to be. They use charcoal to cook their food so it adds a hint of smokiness to the food. The atmosphere is nice and the establishment is clean. Minus one star because 1) they are cash only & no mention of it in English (apparently there is a sign written in Chinese) 2) when asked if it was cash only the server didn't make mention of an ATM next door 3) prices are a little steep ($4 for a can of herbal tea). I would come here again for the food. Come early as there is a wait later in the evening.  *edit after receiving bill: I found it especially rude that the waitress counted our money in front of us as if we were going to short change them. Secondly she noted that we hadn't left enough for tips. I am not one to be stingy when gratuity is due. Since when was gratuities (a way of saying thanks for the service) mandatory? If they had offered credit/ debit and we didn't have to run next door to the ATM in the middle of our meal AND we didn't have to get our own drinks from the fridge at the front, they would get what they felt was deserved"}

{"text":"This new place opened up recently and my party of 5 showed up at 7:30 pm on a Friday night to check out what the hype is all about.   We arrived to see a huge lineup, and we were worried that it would be a long wait. They said it would take an hour or so for a table, but luckily, you can leave your name and number and they will call you once they have a table for you. We took their offer and hung out at one of the BBT places in the same plaza for 35 minutes or so before they were ready for us.   Their charcoal grill is visible when you walk in through the front door and all the seating is in the back. It is actually pretty spacious and well ventilated. It didn't smell like charcoal when I entered and didn't leave with any smell on my clothes.  We ordered the following: - Lamb - Beef - Chicken - Chicken Joints - Chicken Heart - Beef Artery - Grilled Oysters - Enoki Mushrooms - Whole Squid - Garlic shrimp  NOTE: When they say \"4 pcs\", its actually 4 skewers for each order. So if you mark 3 beef, you will have a total of 12 beef skewers.   The order didn't take long to arrive at all. I am guessing a rough 5-10 minutes wait between ordering and the food arriving, and the food all arrived in a hurry!  We must have ordered at least 40-50 skewers, and somehow, we managed to finish most of it.  The food wasn't that bad, but they put a lot of spices and seasoning on them. Might be too salty and spicy for some. The typical ones were pretty good (Beef, Chicken, Lamb), and the grilled oysters were spot on. Keep in mind you are at a skewers place, don't expect the moon.  I liked the beef skewers the most as they were juicy, tasty and the most flavourful. Pretty much everything tasted the same since they used the same spice rub on most of the meat.   The veggies and the seafood are wrapped in a tinfoil packet and is cooked on the grill. They weren't that great, as there wasn't much of a taste to them besides the hot pepper they placed while cooking them.   Avoid the garlic shrimp and the beef artery, they were bland and really hard to chew.   Bottled Water (yes, you read that right) is free, (chilled or room temp). Pop + Alcohol are extra. The alcohol is pretty pricey, not worth it in my opinion.    We finished at around 10, and the line and crowd really thinned out at around 9 ish. If you are looking for a meaty meal late night, come after 9 and you should be okay to get a spot. They are opened til 2 am after all.   Would I go again? Probably, but not any time soon. Not something would every week, or even month.    TLDR:  Pretty Decent Skewers place.  Don't be scared of the lineup. Come after 9 pm if you want a short lineup.  Most (if not all) of the food is spicy.  Stick with the basics (Chicken, Beef, Lamb).  Avoid Garlic Shrimp. CASH only (at the time of this review)"}
{"text":"Heard lots of good things about chat bar so we decided to drop by on a weekday to visit. When we got there at 7pm, it was packed and there was a huge line and had to wait 30-40 mins. Overall it has a good vibe for a casual night out with friends.   Food: Ordered beef skewer, rice cake skewer, pork rice bowl and eggplant. The food quality is okay but I found that most of the dishes catered to spicy eaters. Since I'm not a fan of spicy food, I didn't like the rice cake. The texture was good though. The eggplant dish was way too oily. After I ate one, I couldn't finish it. The portion for this dish is big but its so oily that it makes you feel like you are eating oil. The pork rice bowl was okay but also on the oily side. Nothing special. Beef skewer was okay, nothing special. Overall, food is okay but nothing wow that would entice me to come again.   Atmosphere: Located on main Street, this quaint restaurant is very small. It has a hip vibe to it that is very inviting. Food comes out fast but service is slow, have to ask for water. Just a warning- the washrooms are very dirty!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is their second location for Chat Bar. We really liked the one on silver Star so thought we might give this one a try.   We ordered the lamb, beef, chicken skewers, and a whole squid to share. The skewers were pretty standard. But the whole squid was juicy and flavourful. We also tried the house special potato and spicy beef noodle soup. The beef noodle soup was a little too oily for my liking, would not recommend. The house special potato is a take on baked sliced potato with garlic and spieces. It was mediocore at best, too strong of a garlic taste."}
{"text":"Their first location was located at silverstar blvd. on Steeles in Toronto. I was really excited that they opened their 2nd location in Markham, Main St. Unionville!   I ordered take out on a Wednesday (weekday) afternoon, just shortly after they opened at 3pm.  Very spacious, homey and bright compared to Silverstar location. (maybe evening is different since I dine in at night at Silverstar.) This location design with short tables and chairs reminded me of some restaurants in Taiwan.   Food is very delicious, very garlicky and very heavy flavor. If you don't like spice, garlic, green onions or cilantro then let your waitress/server know when you place your order so they can cater to your flavor. I personally love spices; so I love how they are not cheap with theirs (esp garlic).   Since I ordered takeout, their service is very detailed minded. They package the food very neatly and the flavor of different types of skewers are all separated by tinned foil. The noodles (lamb noodle & spicy and sour noodle) were very good. My mom find their food (lamb noodle soup & enoki) on a saltier side.. so she had to add some hot water into her lamb noodle soup (and I agree with that).   I was somewhat vegan at the time I ordered, so I ordered mostly veggie skewers for myself; meat skewers like wings and lamb for my mom. I enjoyed it a lot, especially the chicken soup with tofu skewers. (I didn't drink the 'chicken' soup) The enoki mushroom was really yummy; a bit salty...so mixing it with a noodle or rice is very good! It was covered with a lot of minced garlic, cilantro and green onions. They made their oysters and scallops using the same flavor too (but I usually would get no salt when I order seafood) [fyi: I tried seafood at Silverstar location only.. I personally favor the clams the most. Oysters and scallops turned out a bit dried. The clams were garlicky and spicy with fresh chopped chilli peppers. Skewer seafood: my fav was the yellow croaker with regular spice.]  Would definitely return since it is around the corner for me. Parking might be a problem on a nice sunny hot summer day. Make sure you give yourself lots of time and patience to find parking & get a table (making reservations is a good idea).  *cash only!* *open till 2am at night!*"}
{"text":"Good ambiance and pretty good food overall. A good place to chill with friends for dinner or late night. Servers don't really speak English. Food wise, the skewers were solid, however I found the lamb and the beef not as tender as I'd like. The grilled scallops was one of my favorites - love the garlic flavour."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening in a group of 5. They don't take reservations so we left our name and phone number while we walked around the plaza. They called us about ten minutes later and we returned but it turns out that our table wasn't actually ready so we waited a few extra minutes while perusing the menu.  The restaurant and the tables are small but the atmosphere was quite nice. I'd say it's perfect for hanging out and chatting in a small group of friends (it does get fairly loud inside). While we had to get our own drinks from the front of the restaurant, the heated platforms to keep our skewers warm were lovely, and so were the buckets to keep finished sticks.   Would definitely recommend the lamb skewers, grilled oysters, and enoki mushrooms. The meat skewers, while delicious, all had the same spice rub so they all tasted pretty similar. The oysters, enoki mushrooms, and eggplants had the same garlic marinade.   Come if you don't mind waiting, like the casual-noisy atmosphere, and enjoy repetitive-tasting food"}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night @ 6pm, immediately got seated. There are two ChatBar location; Scarborough and Unionville. I must say, Unionville provide better food and service.   They use the same spices for all meat so I suggest ordering a few skewers will be enough to try. It's a bit overpriced too.   Grilled vegetables taste great (for garlic lovers) but it bit too oily.   Must try: Minced pork dry noodle.   Method of payment: Cash or debit card"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and the restaurant was packed. We had to wait 10-15 mins for a table. The waiting area is this small cozy area where you can self serve yourself some water and candy. The actual restaurant is pretty small, so there is limited seating.  This restaurant is self-order menu, so they gave you a sheet of paper and you pick what you want. With every order, you get a free small side appetizer. I personally didn't like the dish too much, it was too bland and had no flavour. We ordered the Braised Pork on Rice ($7.95). Amazing flavours for a cheap price! And we got the Noodles in Lamb Soup. This dish was a little bland, it needed more flavour, but the lamb was good.   Finally, we ordered the lamb skewers (4pcs for $5.95). Best. Lamb. Skewers I've had in a very long time! Amazing flavours and great spices. I definitely recommend getting the spicy (wasn't really spicy, but it added a lot of flavour). Definitely 5/5 for the skewers.  I will definitely come back and try more of their skewers."}
{"text":"Food is pretty great and our waiter was very attentive. I didn't enjoy the chicken skewers but I liked the lamb, beef & pork. The oysters were always very tasty but it takes some time before it comes.   The place is dark and kind of small. Wish all the chairs had a back so I can put my jacket over it.   Overall, I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"The dishes were just okay. The service was terrible. When my friends and I just finished eating, and were about to chat for a little bit, the waitress started standing right beside us, giving us pressure to leave. Plus they don't accept debit/credit cards, and was not satisfied with 12% tips. I would give this place a zero star if I could."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this restaurant. i am also happy that they opened another place in Unionville. It makes everything more convenient for me.   Overall, this place is very casual. It is like a Japanese Izakaya, except with better value. Each order comes with more than one skewer and the pricing is very reasonable. The atmosphere is very casual; like going into a nice bar.   The food is fantastic. The taste is strong, so be careful what you order. It may be a little bit spicy for some people. It is perfect for groups to just sit there, chat, and eat some small tapas. The only downer is that the washroom are very small and not always clean. Overall, I would definitely recommend....  One suggestion, when you arrive and see people sitting outside, don't sit down with them and wait. Walk inside to the counter to get a number...We waited outside for a while before we realized that the counter was inside."}
{"text":"**3.5** Chat Bar is similar to a Japanese Izakaya where the concept is small bites loud music and drinking! The vibe of the restaurant is very much so focused on the young Asian crowd and that was pretty much the majority of the patrons haha. Chinese hip hop mixed in with some Korean Japanese and a hint of English.  I came here late on a Monday probably around 11 and the place was packed. Got a table right away but the place still had people walking in after we left.   Service was decent I mean they didn't really do much considering the drinks are self-serve and you take your own order. Nothing special but nothing terrible either.   The food was good, we order the following:  sausage skewers - nothing special decent.  lamb skewers - good juicy not too gamey pork intestine w/ garlic - good but ended up taking out the clove in every piece cause it was a bit too much garlic  chicken wing w/ garlic - I would recommend getting the honey sauce over the garlic because it had no flavour  baked garlic clams - good similar to garlic butter clams at seafood boil restaurants enoki mushrooms - a little salty/over seasoned but good grilled scallops - best thing we had for the night but oddly enough 1/5 scallops was overcooked ... just 1.   after tax and tip I spent around $75 (2 people) and for the amount of food we got + 3 cans of pop it was pretty good and I would come back BUT!! Like other reviews stated there is a decent amount of msg or sodium in the food which led to me having to chug more of my drink.. pretty good sales tactic considering the drinks are self-serve (beer pop coolers and water) and charged later."}
{"text":"A very cute restaurant located in the heart of Main Street Unionville famous for snacks and skewers. I would recommend coming with a party no larger than 4 people as the seating arrangement inside is quite crammed. If you plan to eat during peak hours, your best bet would be to make a reservation. Better safe than sorry. I had come here with a friend on a Saturday evening around 6:30pm. Luckily we beat the dinner crowd without a reservation. We managed to get a table for 2 after waiting for a few minutes. Every table was set up with a piece of slate sitting on top of candles used to keep your skewers warm when served. Although slightly dim inside, the wooden furniture and walls all added to a very quant ambiance. The menu consisted of a large variety of items from meats, vegetables, seafood, noodle soups, and rice.   My friend and I had ordered chicken and beef skewers, chicken wings with honey sauce, grilled okra, grilled enokitake mushrooms and the Chat Bar Spicy and Sour Vermicelli. Out of all the items we ordered, my favourite was the grilled okra which was nicely seasoned and very flavourful. The Chat Bar Spicy and Sour Vermicelli was highly recommended by my friend who orders it every time she eats here. Even though we had requested for a mild level of spiciness it definitely has quite a kick to it. For someone like myself who has a spice tolerance of close to zero, it was tolerable, but i definitely got a runny nose after eating a few slurps of the vermicelli which came with a slight burning sensation on the lip. It was still enjoyable though. I wouldn't recommend the enokitake mushrooms cause really all it is, is enoki mushrooms with maybe half a jar of minced garlic on top. Unless you plan on not talking to anyone for the rest of the day, I wouldn't recommend ordering this. Both the beef and chicken skewers were very flavourful and grilled to perfection. The chicken wasn't overcooked which tends to dry out the meat and the beef was very tender. Overall I had a great dining experience here for the first time. The food came very quickly, and service was efficient. Probably not the most comfortable in terms of seating, but that probably has to do with discouraging customers from wanting to stay too long so that the restaurant can do a few more rounds of tables for more business. Will definitely be back to try other things."}
{"text":"Overall, good ambiance. Good selection of music played. The oyster didn't taste that good. I did enjoy the clams. The steamed scallops can use more flavours and there was a section where you have to order 5 items in a soup base. That was okay.  It's a good venue to gather with friends with some snacks. I like this venue over the silver star location.   Bring cash if you come, they only take cash."}
{"text":"I find in terms of ambiance the unionville mainstreet location is more cosy. However, I like how this location because we can go directly to the fridge to grab the beer and you can watch the chef cook while you wait.   The oyster was much larger at this location. In terms of the shelled scallops, I prefer the unionville location. Overall this is always one of my go to skewer place. Will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Service is good. Staffs are very tentative. Grilled food is delicious and kept warm with a warming plate.  Tables are a bit small"}
{"text":"Love the variety in the menu. The prices is also not super expensive depending on what you order. Drinks are self served - they don't charge for water. The only down side is the restaurant is quite small so tables are really closed together and the booth tables are so small.   If you're waiting for your table you can ask for the menu and start making your order."}
{"text":"Went to this place after hearing all the hype from other friends, and had some high expectations. I have to say this place is pretty good. the decor when you first arrive is very relaxing and casual. very comfortable design. Overall it is a nice location. This food although slightly pricier than normal chinese bbq joints, is pretty good. We went in a party of 10 people. so it took us a longer than usual wait. Unfortunately this place does not take any reservations. so its better to limit your part to probably 6 people or so. to make life easier. The food specialty is that it is a coal grill. so it goes back to the days when you have coal bbq and have that coal flavour in the food. This place is definitely pretty good.   We had quite a bit of food, such as lamb skewers, oysters, beef skewers, as well as clam and lots of variety of veggies. the money wise it does add up. which is why it is better spent in this restaurant with more people.   The service was pretty efficient and i liked the fact that they place the skewers on a heated plate so that it would stay warm when your still eating.   Definitely a place people should try at least once, from the area. i would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Ordered a take out. They forgot my oyster and the service is terrible. They don't even give you a nice look and the food is just so so. The lamb skewers are not juicy as we expected. So disappointed."}
{"text":"I go here like at least once a month and I'm not sure if it's the food, environment or hours but probably a mix of all three keeps bringing me back. The skewers are delish even though I only get the lamb and beef ones but still, delish. The prices are also good for what you're getting and you must try the sweet potatoes, another delish item. I don't usually explore past these but some of the items are a hit or miss depending on what you like. Still, give it a try if you're in the area and thank me laterrrr"}
{"text":"New restaurant in the destiny plaza at Old Kennedy and Steeles.  Right when you walk in, it's an open kitchen, where you can see the yakitori being smoked.  The waiters seem to all speak Mandarin, but with broken English they were able to serve us.  The layout is very cute with all the tables being wood, the booths seem a little small, we sat on a high table.  The chairs are a little hard and uncomfy.  They don't have their liquor license yet, so they have pop or bottled water at the front where you help yourself.  The pop is $1.75.  They have a warming tray to place your ordered yakitori while you eat.  One order comes with 4 skewers, and it's $5.95 for a set.  They have a variety of different meats.  We tried to 2 that were recommended, lamb and pork intestines.  Both are very good, the lamb were nicely seasoned and not too salty, the pork intestines had a garlic clove in the middle that was crunchy, very nice pairing.  We tried the eggplant skewer, it didn't come in a skewer, but on a plate, well seasoned with cilantro, it was slightly salty after a couple more bites.  Also wanted to try a noodle, so got the minced meat noodle.  This was a cold noodle, mixed with minced meat, cucumber, cilantro.  This was probably my least favourite.  It was too salty for my taste, it needed more cucumber to cut the salt.  Lastly we got squid tentacle.  It was 2 sets of tentacles, not too big.  Once again using the same seasoning, so i found it was salty.  Overall an interesting concept.  The skewers are really yummy, I think that's what I would stick with next time I come.  The service was pretty good, you can tell they are new, they are not familiar with the table numbers yet.  But they're polite."}
{"text":"small place but the interior design is really nice so you don't feel cramped up  !   got the lab skewer noodles and clams and they were all so delicious and left satisfied  you can adjust the spice on the lamb skewer which is really great and the flavours taste amazing. they were juicy and tender  the clams flavours taste similar to captains boil clams and were flavourful with a garlicky taste  the noodles were ma lat spicy and definitely had a kick to it  service inside was very quick however the wait fo get a seat was quite slow because there were a lot of people. probably because it is so yummy !!!  would come again for a quick bite or for a meal"}
{"text":"This was the backup plan when we found out the restaurant we originally planned to go to closed at 11pm. We had to wait about 10 minutes to get seated, but that's alright. The restaurant itself is dark, and the music they play is quite loud. The first issue while they do have a good number of servers for a restaurant of this size, the majority of the ones we talked to knew almost no English. Even when trying to get a table, we spoke in English, and the waitress responded in Mandarin. I mean, yes, I'm Chinese, but I speak Cantonese. It's difficult when the customer understands the waitress more than the waitress understands the customer.   We were seated at one of the higher bar-like tables in the center of the restaurant. Their bar stool-like chairs have seats that are quite uncomfortable. I'm not a very big person (just over 5 feet), but this seat ends somewhere around my upper-mid thigh, and as it's wood and has no padding, it wasn't a fun sitting experience. The tables are also really narrow.   They don't serve tap water here. They offered us water bottles. Not until the end of our meal did we realize they were free (chalk that one up to language barriers). Here's the thing. If I don't order a drink, I'm expecting water to be given to me. If it's not automatically given to me, I ask for it, and you offer me bottled water, I'm assuming I have to pay for it, especially if you don't understand me and I don't understand you. It's just easier for everyone if you offer me water without me having to ask for it.  Food:  I know Foodie M is calling me out for having bad taste in her review, as I am one of the ones who will not give Chat Bar a 5 star review, but I really don't think this deserves 5 stars. Some of the food was pretty good, but some of it was just not mind-blowing enough to deserve a 5.  Lamb skewers ($5.95 - 4 skewers) - While this is a fairly reasonable price for lamb skewers, giving the amount of lamb they put on each skewer, I've had better and more reasonably priced lamb skewers elsewhere. I wouldn't mind ordering these ones again, but they're maybe a 3.5 in my books.  Lamb noodle soup ($6.95) - I thought that this would be a legit sized bowl of noodles. It was served in a small stone bowl akin to the ones that you get steamed egg or a side of kimchi stew in at Korean BBQ restaurants. The portion definitely does not justify the price. The lamb in it was pretty tasty. Each piece of lamb had a little bit of fat that I like, but I know there are people who would not like that as well. The noodles also had a good texture. If this bowl of noodles was $5, I'd give it a 4/5, but because it wasn't $5, I'd give it a 2.5.  Beef tendon and bean curd ($5.95) - This is one of their recommended dishes. I was expecting it to be chunks of marinated beef tendon and chunks of marinated tofu served cold. What I got was a bowl of spicy bean curd noodles (think a thin, flat sheet of firm tofu with little raised bumps for texture, then shredded). It was tasty, but not worth the price. I spent quite a while trying to find the beef tendon in the dish. I finally found a small amount of it, also shredded, mixed into my bean curd threads. I'm thinking the ratio of bean curd to tendon was about 20:1. Something like that. The tendon was also really chewy. I'm not sure whether that was a good thing or not. This was tasty, but because of the description of the item and the price of the item, I don't think this was worth its price tag. I'd give this one a 2.5/5 as well.  Garlic clam ($5.95) - This one was me taking a risk, because I had no idea how many clams I was getting for this price (notice that it says clam, and not clams). My risk paid off! They served us a tinfoil packet on a plate. They told us, in Mandarin (which we hadn't spoken to them in all night) that we should use our chopsticks to tear the packet apart because it was very hot inside. That it certainly was. Garlic butter steam is a beautiful thing. The portion on this was quite fair for the price. The clams were juicy and tender and fresh. The garlic butter and the bits of chopped spicy peppers in there just made it that much better. I'd give this one a 4.5 out of 5. They lost the extra .5 because they would have had to wow me with the portion of this dish, and while I agree that it was a fair portion for the price, it wasn't an amazing deal. I'll give it a 5 for taste though. I could have gone for a number of orders of just these clams.  I might come back for the clams, and if I'm really craving them, the lamb skewers, but given the service issues, I don't know whether the clams are worth it."}
{"text":"This is a bbq place where there's skewers for a slightly higher price than you'd find at those Asian night markets. However, I totally love the ambience and atmosphere of the tiny space. Very cozy and intimate with dim but sufficient lighting. I sat by a window so lots of sun. Still, I highly recommend this as a date place.  It was lamb day for my lunch companion and me so we both got lamb noodles, lamb skewers, and an order of mackerels (3 fish per order, sweet deal).  Lamb skewers were great. The garlicky spice was delicious but I'm a huge fan of garlic anyway. They placed the sewers on the slate we had with tea candles lit underneath to warm the food. Not too much fat content so I'd give the skewers 4.9/5. Perf score would be no fat haha! Taste didn't super stand out though.   The menu said grilled mackerel so I was expecting it Japanese style but it came out looking like it was grilled in Mordor. The head was so fried/grilled that all that was left is a husk of what used to be a skull. Otherwise, the fish was good. The spice used is the same as the lamb skewer but the taste of the spice was less pronounced and the taste of fish was stronger. Still great. I still would've preferred grilled Japanese style and not like it was dipped in Mordor.   Lamb noodles came last. Personally there were too many fat bits in this but they sure gave a lot of lamb chunks for toppings. 3/5.  I don't take into account service at Asian places. Service was par: not in your face, didn't ask how the food was. Honestly, I don't care if waiters ask me this stuff anyway.  If I were to eat these three again, I'd go in the order of lamb noodles, mackerel, then skewers.  Would I recommend? Probably not. Ambience was solid 5/5 but the food was okay."}
{"text":"Intimate place for a couples. They have booths. High tops and counter tops. I prefer sitting in the booths cause the place is a little loud so it's better to be in the booths. There plackets on the wall are cute and funny. There are so many types of skewers you can get. Umm but if you don't like spicy food you might want to check cause some of it are spicy.  I love how you can get you own drinks at the front. Beers, pop, water and ???. The bottle waters are free so that so nice of them!  I'm not a fan of the front entrance it was a little oily/ slippery so be careful?..."}
{"text":"My SO and I decided to come here with another friend couple for a double date this past Saturday. We arrived closer to 8 and didn't get to eat until 9:30...talk about hangry status (sorry BF) Upon arrival, we were at the end of the line, with another 5-6 groups ahead of us. Friend put a name down for them to call us, and there was definitely some organizational mishap, which to us being missed, and another party basically skipping out on the wait. By this point in our lineup, I was getting frustrated and irked that there were people not eating, and just chilling around. I get the atmosphere is meant for a group setting, but if you're just killing time, and by that I mean around half hour of not eating...it's time for you to go.   Another gripe is that their water is all bottled Real Canadian water (yes the no frills brand)...which leads to a lot of waste already PLUS the skewer waste...please consider the environment Chat Bar and perhaps get a water filtration system so you can have jugs of water to fill up for each table.. *sigh*  Now for the real review: we ordered a variety of items including: clams in garlic seasoning, cumin lamb, chicken, beef, chicken knuckle, pork, rice in stone bowl  Taste is just alright - many of the meats have a lot of fat in them, namely the sparerib rice in stone bowl, the beef and the seasoning started tasting the same after a while. There is some grit in the beef and lamb, which leads me to think that they don't use the best quality of meat out there. Everything started coming at once, and the warming plate doesn't do the best job when it comes to warming...Drinks are self serve, and each of us paid about $35 pp..keep in mind that the skewers come in a set of 4, with about 1/4 cup of meat per skewer so take that into consideration or else you'll be stuck eating leftover meat for the next two meals :P The best tasting on the dish were the chicken wings, and the seafood.  Back to eating salad for me! Pro tip: while waiting in line, you can decide how many orders of each item you'd like to order  May not come back as I enjoy the cook your own skewer experience over the waiting around for a table/food exp.."}
{"text":"Service is good food is decent but 1) food are way over priced like 4 lamb skeward cost almost 6 bucks. 2) all food tasted the same. 3) you have to pay for every drinks, even for water. 4) place is small, if you go during winter there's no places to put your jacket. 5) def not going back 6) cash only 7) they won't sperate bills even if you handed in separate orders"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  If you love mainland Chinese BBQ then this is the place for you.  Some dishes can be a little spicy (which I love) but there are plenty that are mild of that is all you can handle. :) Whenever I go here, I usually try and bit of everything so check out my pics for what I enjoyed !  The BBQ lamb and beef sticks are very good here.  The 2 appetizers I got were amazing !   Cucumber with soy sauce beef, beef tendon and bean curd.  Mmm.  So tasty! I absolutely loved the little wonton with egg soup also - don't overlook these items on the menu!  The only downside to this place is that it is super busy and you can wait for a long time to get a table. However, once you do get in the service is fast and very friendly!    I love their concept also of \"get your own drink\". You don't have to wait for beer service and can just grab it yourself.  Very trusting and comfortable method :)"}
{"text":"Had some take-out here and I loved the concept, the food, and just the overall execution of Chat Bar. This will definitely be my go-to place for just Northern Chinese BBQ skewers.  All the skewers skewers were excellent and I believe they use charcoal here which adds to that extra smokiness and crispiness.   I had the privilege of trying many different meat skewers and in general they were all very well seasoned. The earthiness of the cumin combined with some spices and an overall garlicky flavor was very tasty. My favorites included the lamb, the chicken knuckles, and the squid. The chicken knuckles were delightfully crunchy and there's a nice succulent sweetness coming from it. The lamb and squid of course are the very safe choices here and they were done very well; tender yet crispy. I tried many others including the chicken heart, some intestines, and some sausages. For the most part they just tasting like meat with different textures but I was actually surprised with the pork intestines which were crunch on the outside yet had a nice chew to it. Think tripe, except imagine a super crisp skin around it.   For the veggies, the house special potatoes were thinly sliced and steam baked with a hearty dose of garlic (Think scalloped except the inside of the bake). Likewise the eggplant was wonderful with the powerful garlic, coriander, and some chilies all balancing out with the sweetness of the eggplant itself. When I say there was a hearty dose of garlic I mean a REALLY hearty dose  of it, so just a heads-up for all the garlic sensitive people out there! We wanted their okra but they didn't have any that day."}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere but our food took WAY too long (1 hour). We had to pause in between because we finished the first few dishes."}
{"text":"Space were little small for a four person table. They wasn't able to place all of our food on table. We had to always walk to the front to get drinks. Foods were okay. I like the decoration there, its kind of a bar feel."}
{"text":"Went to Chat Bar with my CT on a Monday night to check out what the hype is for this place because on the weekends there are always huge line up.  Not knowing what to expect due to limited reviews, we walked in very open minded.  First thing that I noticed is the strong charcoal smell from all the grilling of skewers which I am not a big fan off because I don't want to smell like BBQ after dinner, but we went in anyway.  Sat down, looked at the menu and decided to try 3 items to see how it goes, we had the lamb skewer, beef skewer and the fish.  Lamb skewer was good as the taste and texture was not bad, but for 4 skewer for $6, not sure if it's worth it.  Beef skewer just tasted like the lamb except is was harder to chew.  The fish was okay, similar taste than the lamb and beef and not too special.  They said you can eat the bone too, but I highly DO NOT recommend eating it with the bone.  3 items took over 1.5 hour to come (lamb came first, then the other two took forever), which is unacceptable!  Why so SLOW?!  Place is very dim and smell like charcoal, drinks are okay due to the wide variety of selections including the little budda beer!  Water is free (bottled water too!) but all drinks, you need to pick them up at the front and open it yourself, so no service whatsoever.  Overall, not a big fan and would rather spend my money on something better. The price adds up quickly if you go with a larger group due to small portions."}
{"text":"Very small place. Tacky to have polaroids up on the wall and didn't like how clear tape was used to cover holes in air duct system. One or two servers running around the small place. However the food wasn't bad. Use of a lot of green onions and garlic for taste...especially with the eggplant, the oysters, and the scallops which we ordered. Note that credit cards are NOT accepted for payment. Just cash or use of debit card."}
{"text":"Service is good here. Overall food is below average. Both skewers and seafood are way too salty and they all have the same flavour."}
{"text":"3.5 stars out of 5. I went because I was nearby and this was opened late. We got the chicken, beef, pork, and lamb skewers and they tasted decent, not the greatest. The overall prices are pretty good for Markham standards and the portions are fair. Overall, okay food and okay prices."}
{"text":"Very Unique spot. The grill food was very very nice. I love how they presented there products, the aroma of the noodle soups were delicious!!!"}
{"text":"It is located in Unionville with a very cozy feel. Nice place to chat and have snacks. Came here with not much expectations but their lamb skewers definitely exceeded our expectations.  Will return!"}
{"text":"Really solid skewers. Reasonable price- nice decor and comfortable seating. We were a group of 7 and waited around 40min on a Friday night.  The food comes really quick. All drinks you go get yourself but the water bottles are free.  I probably wouldn't go for the pork again but I mostly liked the lamb, chicken cartilage, skewers, and the scallops. The pork belly rice was good too. As busy as they were, they never pressure you to get out, which I liked. And yes, they did come by and you were able to get service."}
{"text":"I think their BBQ is alright. Definitely wouldn't come back for Chinese BBQ when there are so many better restaurants nearby (within 5 minutes of driving). I just wanted to check it out since it opened for some time now. But the meat skewers did not impress. Plus, it is also more expensive to eat here. So there is absolutely no reason why I would ever come back.   Now I'm not saying it's horrible. But there's manyyy Chinese BBQ nearby. So what's the incentive to come here ?"}
{"text":"This place serves mainly skewers, there are some hot stone pot, and few main dishes. The service is extremely quick when you ask for things like water or napkins.  Price is very cheap and the place is adorable with wooden decor and Stone Age like dish wares. The water cups we got were sooo cute reminded me of childhood tooth brushing cups.  See my pictures"}
{"text":"I'm having mixed feelings about this place.   Upon entering, the place is small and dark. You place your order on a paper menu and you grab your drinks yourself up at the front. Water bottles are free.   I came with my cousins and we ordered a bunch of stuff to eat. The size of their appetizers was quite generous. We got the beef tripe and cucumbers. Both were delicious! For skewers, we got beef, lamb, pork, chicken wings, and ox tongue. These were placed on a slate that had candles underneath to keep them warm. The meat was tender but the taste was meh -- I've had better. Sorta tasted like the skewers you'd find at a night markets. We also ordered the scallops and that was delicious as well. The cabbage on the menu said it was skewer but I was surprised to see that it was actually in a bowl. It was tasty but not as crispy as I wanted it to be.   Overall I don't think i would be coming back unless I was in the area and really craving it."}
{"text":"Love their scallops and various skewers. Drinks are self-serve, which is unique. Their decor is gorgeous.  Some staff only speak mandarin, so there is a bit of trouble communicating with them."}
{"text":"First time here at this location.  As a semi self serve  restaurant, i believe its a decent place to enjoy your dinner or whatever the case is. Why i say semi self serve? well they had good attitudes and serves you food, BUT all drinks are self serve. which is not a big deal. Water is free(water bottles). I tired Lamp,Chicken wings, and Chicken Joints Skewers. Taste decent! not bad at all. Great idea on the idea of a heat table (my picture). Environment is decent, dim light good music. Overall great place, CASH only tho -1 star ()"}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for new places to try and came across Chat Bar!  We came here for an early dinner, without reservations. We waited about 20 mins for a spot. Service was great - the servers spoke mostly in Mandarin even though we were ordering in English lol. We were seated at the booth area.   Each table had a hot plate to keep the skewers heated, which is nice!  That kept everything nice and hot.  Highlights of the night (skewers): * Okra * Lamb  * Beef * Chicken  Sides: * Enoki mushrooms (These were marinated so well!)  Items I DON'T recommend:  * Rice cakes  It was SOO HARD to chew on.. omg we only ate 2 lol  * Beef tendons  This was one of the skewers with the \"highly recommended\" stamp beside it.. omg bad idea; it was like chewing on rubber with no taste hahaha  * Grilled pork on rice There's no sauce and the grilled pork was so dry."}
{"text":"Was in the area and nothing was opened around 12pm. Came across this cute little hut of a restaurant and decided to venture in. The whole restaurant exterior and interior was made all out of wood. It gave a feeling of a small rural ramen shop in Japan. All the chairs and tables were also made of wood. The restaurant itself was really really small. Probably around 10 tables?   The concept was interesting as well. They had a small metal holder that held 2 tealight candles and on top of it was a black stone plate. Which was basically used for keeping your skewers warm.  The menu was also very cute. It was printed on a biege tint paper and had a cartoonish  imaginary on it as well. You basically use the sharpie marker they provide you, and check off what you want.  We asked for hot water and the waiter came back with 2 small tin mug cups. Which I thought were adorable and cute! My hubby didn't like it and said it was chipped. But I honestly think it was meant to be like a rustic touch.  They also had a small bucket at the side of the table. It was used to dispose your skewer sticks.  Everything was basically grilled inside the kitchen and brought out to your table and kept warm on the heating plate.  We ordered a load of food to try:  Jumbo Lamb Skewers $6 Lamb Kidneys Skewers (4) $5.95 Beef Skewers (4) $5.95 Chicken Hearts Skewers (4) $5.95 Chicken Gizzards Skewers (4) $5.95  For the meats and inners it was basically the same seasoning. All were tasty. The Jumbo Lamb Skewer was funny, it was like a thick tree branch and just a thick cut of lamb meat (like loin cut). It tastes pretty much the same as the regular lamb skewers.  Charcoal Grilled Oysters (6) $18.95 The oysters were huge!! And very fresh, moist and tasty! They had some slight sweet garlicky sauce with red chillies on top which I think was a bit too much. I brush off a bit of it before I ate it.  Charcoal Grilled Scallops (5) $12.95 Presentation of the scallops were pretty. But it was ok. The clear vermicelli didn't have much flavour, and the scallops were buried underneath, like it was hidden treasure lol. This also has a slight sweet garlicky sauce with red chillies on top, but slightly less than the oysters.   Grilled Okra $3.99 Okra were good and had a dry seasoning on top. And we each had at least 5 pieces each.  Grilled Eggplant $4.25 There was at least 4 pieces of eggplant. On top it had the same slight garlicky sauce with red chillies on top. A bit too much had to brush some off before eating. But it was still very tasty.  Grilled Squid Tentacles $6.75 Was very good came on a plate with a pair of scissors..but we didn't end up using it. It was very tender and yummy!!  We piled everything in the warming plate lol. At the end it didn't really keep it that warm cuz most of the heat was in the middle area. And also our tealight candles were running low of wax.   There was way too many we wanted to try...and I think we overdid it for our 1st visit. The meats and seasoning got a little overwhelming at the end. I would of ordered rice to counter balance all that meat. But than also didn't want to be filled up with rice. If they had like lettuce as an option, could wrap the meats would've been better."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends! Great for asian BBQ and relatively fast service. However the restaurant is a little small itself and table are not big either, not great for a big group of people but food is good."}
{"text":"Came late on a weeknight for dinner with my girlfriend. Cash only. The place is decorated nicely. Trendy. You grab your own drinks from the front, and the water they give out is bottled.  We ordered the enoki mushrooms, chicken wings, lamb skewers and a mixed noodles. The skewers come out and are placed on the heated slab on the table to keep them warm. A cool feature.  All the skewers were pretty decent. And the noodles were nice. But my favourite of the night was definitely the enoki mushrooms. They come in a very flavourful garlic marinade/sauce, that I found delicious.  Price is on the higher end, and service was iffy. Might return."}
{"text":"My cousin mentioned this place earlier and it seemed interesting enough to try. It's been open for only a week. I think there was a Mexican restaurant in this space before.  There's a little kiosk at the front of the building with a takeout window that opens up to the sidewalk, making it convenient to grab some food as you stroll by. There's also indoor dining in a rustic setting furnished with thick heavy wooden tables and intimate lighting. Nice.  The menu is interesting, with lots of choices of skewered meats, seafood, soups, rice dishes, and more. Even more interesting, they serve just about every part of the animal. For example: pork knuckle; pork skin; chicken heart, chicken gizzard, chicken cartilage; lamb kidney; and more. You get the idea...  My dining companion this evening was in heaven but those items don't appeal to my palate so we ordered more conventional dishes - edamame, chicken, pork, and beef skewers, quail, fish, and mushrooms.  It's a good thing I love garlic because the mushrooms had LOTS of it. I probably should have had the quail first because it was cold and a little dry by the time I got to it. The skewers were placed on a piece of slate with tea candles under it to keep them warm. Nice touch. The fish was crispy enough to eat the bones and all. The skewers were nicely cooked and tender but the spice (cumin?) was a tad too much from being great.  The service was okay. Our server asked about allergies and spice level when taking our order. Good move. Score a point. At the end of our meal, most of the dirty plates were still on the table. Subtract a point.  Tonight was cash only because they didn't have their debit/credit system set up yet. I can see the potential of this place and I hope they will only get better. I'll be back to try more of their menu, just not the \"unconventional\" items."}
{"text":"Visited on a weekday night, last week. Excellent customer service. I think the food is alright, I'm only giving the 5-star for the service. Especially the waitress serving us. rare to see this kind of service attitude at a BBQ place."}
{"text":"Brace yourself for a night of endless chugging water while enjoying many pieces of flavourful meats covered in a variety of spices and loads of MSGs. It's so good, but also will run you many trips to the bathroom.  Environment: Located at the plaza at Steeles/Silver Star Blvd, the plaza has many newly opened/hip Chinese restaurants and many times it's kind of difficult to find parking. But if you don't mind walking a little, you can try to park at the grocery store beside it.  The restaurant itself is quite small and it's recommended that you come as a group of 6 or smaller. I like the decor of this place, it has a lot of character and gives a cozy bar vibe. If you can read Chinese, some of the writings on the signs are hilarious.   Food: You write down your order from a menu sheet, which is written in both Chinese and English. Many of the skewer orders will come in 4 pieces per order, so make your picks wisely. I really enjoyed their Lamb, Chicken Cartilage, Beef, Intestine, Honey Chicken Wings, and the Oyster on the Chef Special.  Their skewers are really flavourful and it has many depth of flavouring, as opposed to the over satuated chili powder that many places tend to overload you with. The Oyster was the best of the meal in my opinion, because not only was the flavour good, the oyster meat was very tender and juicy. I also like how they place the skewers on heated plates on your table so it keeps the meat warm and tasty. However, as I mentioned earlier on my intro, the stuff here are covered with MSG, so you'll end up drinking lots of water. They give you bottled water here and my group ended up drinking 2-3 bottles per person.  Service: Pretty much minimal service. The servers will come if you call for them, but usually they will not come check up on you, unless it's to replace the filled bucket with an empty one. It seems that even though they speak English here, they can understand you better if you speak Mandarin to them.  Overall, I think I would definitely come again because the flavour of the skewers are really good. Though the price is a little higher than other Chinese BBQ restaurants (we paid around $30/person), I think the higher quality of food justifies it.   PS. Cash only"}
{"text":"This place was okay, I wouldn't recommend this as a must go to my friends. The pricing and the food don't match, overpriced! Lots of parking because it is in a plaza but beware! This is cash only and there is no nearby atm unless during day time. I went in the night time and had to go to bmo.   This is for people looking for a drink and some bbq for their beer."}
{"text":"3.5 stars Came here with a group of friends around 7:30 on a Saturday night. Wait time for the table was about 30mins.  Skewers: lots of variety, I especially liked the lamb and chicken heart. Beef skewers were a bit disappointing as they were on the dry side.  We also ordered the pickled cucumber appetizer which was a good balance to the spicy skewers. Beers n drinks were expensive. Around $6-$7 for a bottle of beer. Overall we had a good time at the restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here on a weeknight thinking it will be less people and not need to wait...However we were wrong.  We end up waiting for 30mins to get a seat.  We ordered beef and rice cake skewer, pork rice, fried egg plant and spicy beef noodle.  Although we already asked for less spicy.. but still very spicy for us.  The beef skewer was good and very tasty and soft.  The rice cake skewer was spicy because they put spicy herbs on top.  The egg plant taste good but very oily.  Not everyone would want to eat that dish.  The pork rice is not bad but the pork is a bit stiff on the side.  The spicy beef noodle comes with spicy soup.  The spiciness paralyze my lip for a bit.  Overall if you like spicy food, its not bad.  You will be surrpise the price does add up when you order many small dishes.  If you like spicy food, it's not a bad place to eat with friends and drink a few beers."}
{"text":"This spot is awesome if you're coming with a group of friends who you're looking to catch up with and want a variety of tasty snacks. Theres a wide selection of various skewers which are all prepared fresh to order and placed on a hot plate at your table to keep them warm. Aside from skewers they also have a variety of bbqed seafood, veggies, rice, soups and mini build your own hot pots. The skewers are the reason I go to this place as they're so flavorful and juicy, however do prepare to down 2-3 bottles of water as I'm certain MSG is blended into the seasoning (however bottled water here is complimentary which is a nice touch). Drinks are also self served where you grab what you'd like to drink from the bar fridge and bring it to your table, which will then be totaled onto your bill in the end. I truly love the vibe of the place, however although it feels like a bar where you'd enjoy to eat skewers, down some bottles and watch a game.... they don't put any sports games on the screen here."}
{"text":"Last night, I went out for dinner. We didn't know what to get, so we walked around unionville area, I saw Chat Bar, it's pretty interesting place to dining in. If you are a chater box, or wanted to chill with friends in a cozy place for snacks and a small drink. Highly recommend this places not too noisy, the food comes pretty fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Came upon this Chinese styled yakitori restaurant which opened less than a month ago. Located right next to Destiny's Scarborough, same plaza. Open daily from 4pm -2am.  Right when you walk in, you can see their entire kitchen through a glass window. Get to see their chefs grilling, frying, prepping, everything !  Their booths for 4 are 'Asian-sized' which means they're smaller and tighter. There was only 2 of us so it was perfect. They also have longer bench tables for bigger groups.   They have a variety of skewers and that's what they specialize in. They use the same sauce for pretty much everything and it's similar to the Lamb Skewer spices. Highly recommend the Chinese Bun!   Each table has a stone tray where skewers are delivered onto. It's heated with 2 tea light candles underneath so your food stays warmer, longer. A small bucket for the empty skewers are on each table.   They speak Mandarin and it seems that English is their 2nd language. But you're not eating rocket science so broken English should be suffice.  They're still waiting for their liquor license so no alcohol yet. But many of their dishes would be perfect with a nice cold beer."}
{"text":"The lamb, beef skewers were perfectly cooked. The scallops wasn't what I expected with the price that I have to pay for. Oysters were ok... I dun think it's a fresh oyster. You grab your own drinks but when I asked them for a glass they said they don't provide that. I was kinda disappointed with that. The bill came up to 95$ for two people and pretty much what's on the pictures I attached. I only paid 5% of the tips because I don't think it's worth 10%, then the waitress came and told me it's not enough tips and pointed out that I only paid 5%. which that leads me to never return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Nice what my friend and I ordered overall is good. Ice tea, water and any drinks pick in front of the cashier up. I will go next time but waiting time is too long."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I really, really want to like this place.  We decided to try this place after our disappointment to find Destiny (next door) was closed for the night during the blizzard. From the outside, it looks pretty inviting with the decorative fake blowing fire in the windows.  When you walk in, you're greeted with a nice burst of hot air which is refreshing coming inside in winter. We were seated promptly in a very cozy, dimly lit private booth. The waitress was friendly enough, as was the bus person who would rush by our table every now and then. I really could have taken a nap here it was that cozy. I felt almost like we were in a blanket fort inside our nooky booth. Also, they have chalk available at your table so you can scribble around on the chalkboard each booth has beside it. So naturally, I drew a heart with T+W beside someone else's attempted phone number prank.  Though, I really couldn't get over the overwhelming smell of charcoal burning from the kitchen. However, that's just personal taste.  So far so good! we may just have a new hang out! - Uuuuuntil the food arrived.  My beef skewers were very chewy, a lot of fat. And it was SO SPICY. I didn't feel like laying in the fetal position in my bathroom all night, so I decided to try to wipe all the seasoning off with my napkin. Still not working. So I hid them in a napkin and put them inside this used skewer receptacle.  Oh yay, my BREAD has arrived. Surely you cannot mess up something as simple as a bun, and I'm French Canadian, so bring it on! NOPE! THIS IS CHAT BAR WHERE WE LATHER EVERYTHING WITH HARDCORE SALT, PARSLEY AND CHARCOAL. It was so salty and heavily seasoned and made my burps taste like charcoal, I again had to try to remove the seasoning with my napkin and upon failing, hiding it in a napkin and putting it in the rising pile inside the receptacle cup.  Add a few more harshly seasoned and charcoal-burpey sides and you now have a totally over flowing used skewer receptacle.  It was really terrible, and we will not go back.  I really want to believe this is all due to personal taste, and if you like spicy, heavily seasoned barbecued items then you may just enjoy the food.  ...I still have the charcoal burps."}
{"text":"Been there two times, the presentation of their food is very good, I like how they have a heated stone on their table to keep all of their skewers warm all the time, so I didn't feel like I needed to rush to finish them \"while it's warm\", my friends and I were able to enjoy chatting around the whole time. It is pretty loud in there, I've tried beer there but the fridge was not cold at all on the night we went.  Aside from the presentation of their food, I find the taste to be average for the price they charge, I know a few places around the same area that has better/similar skewers for cheaper price (but those are just regular Chinese restaurants rather than having this \"bar atmosphere\")  I wouldn't mind visiting again just for hanging out with friends, but wouldn't go just for the food."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new late night joint for our Friday night date night meal and Chat Bar on Main Street Unionville fit the bill.  This is the newer location as the original one is located on Silverstar and Steeles.  Serving grilled skewered meats on a stick and various noodles and rice dishes, Chat Bar is trying to be a hip variant of a Asian pub with hip decor and music playing in the background.  The menu is limited but pretty tasty especially the chicken gizzards and the spicy beef on rice.  The spicy beef tripe pot with choice of 5 items was also yummy as the soup base has a good kick to it.  The price point is a higher then other similar places but given the decor and area it's still reasonable.  The place is also small but they do have a separate take out window for those who don't want to eat in.  The drink selection is also small with a few beers and pop available.  They are cash only right now as they don't accept credit or debit.    Overall it's a nice addition on the Unionville Main Street strip."}
{"text":"Was interested in a late night snack and drinks.. Friends suggested Chat Bar at Silverstar Blvd..   Overall pretty disappointed.  The place has a nice chill-drink atmosphere, but that's about it..  All drinks (including beer) are self serve..  You h w to walk up to the counter and open the fridge to grab your choice of beer.. Selection was ok.. Nothing special..   Sat down and looked at the menu... Noticed everything was pricy.. Which would be ok if the quality was there..  My two other friends have been there before and told me the food was just mediocre and insisted I don't order he lamb skewers..  We ended up ordering a few dishes.. Lamb skewers, beef tendon and bean curd, kimchi fried rice, skewered chicken wings, enoki mushrooms, and skewered cabbage.  Most of these items were listed as their chef recommendations and specialties..  Lamb tasted horrible for the price.. The lamb meat was not selected properly by the chef.. Hardly any fat at all, so it was tasteless and it was over cooked..  Kimchi fried rice tasted nothing like the way it should.. And didn't have any of the details it should.. Lol, don't think the chefs had enough experience to know what it should taste like and how it's usually dressed at real Korean places..  I would say the skewered chicken wings are pretty good, 4 stars..  Beers are $6 each..   Sad thing is, they grill everything on charcoal, but it doesn't taste good.. Not worth going back!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy charcoal grilled skewers from Taste of Asia or Night it Up back in the good ol' summer days, this is the place to satisfy your cravings!   Decided to try here on a Monday night with JW. There were actually still people waiting for table when we left. Imagine the weekends... packed like sardines in a small, stuffy, charcoal filled environment. No, thanks!  Ordered the lamb, beef and garfish to share. They served the skewers on a heated platform over candles... I thought the presentation was pretty neat :)   The flavour was spot on but it gets a bit boring when all the food had the SAME spice rub taste. I would love more variety... maybe a good dipping sauce to go along? The lamb and beef tasted exactly the same... just that the lamb was more tender. I'd come back just for the lamb skewers. Garfish was crispy, the meat was soft and tender... but I have had better ones at Oriental Gourmet.  We did wait close to an hour from our first lamb skewers to the remaining orders. Now I understand why it is called Chat Bar. JW and I literally chatted for 45 mins to an hour before the food came lol.  We almost refused to pay tips for the minimal service. The waitstaff were courteous and friendly... but we had to fetch our own drinks from the beer/pop fridge in the front counter and open it ourselves. They charge you after you consume. Bottled water is complimentary. It is a nice feature where it makes you feel like home... I might as well just fetch my food too? Our tips should solely be for the hardworking kitchen staff, sniffing charcoal all day IMO.  I would come back for lamb skewers takeout. I know it is overpriced ($5.95/4 pcs) but you gotta do what you gotta do when your craving hits lol.  P.S. Brush up your mandarin before coming here! You'll need it."}
{"text":"I will keep this short and simple. This is probably one of my worst experience in a Chinese owned restaurant. I never expect much service from a restaurant like this as I go in for the food primarily. Food was decent however here came the problem- we were first timers. We ordered 1 to 2 orders of certain items, however we had no idea  \"4pcs\" on the menu means 4 skewers per order. At the end approximately 50 skewers plus rice plus baked scallops and enoki mushroom came to the table. When we handed in our order to the server \"apparently manager\" he did not inform us the fact we over ordered. Knowing when you punch in $144 worth of skewers for 2 people, any server seeing that should have noticed the fact or at least just simply ask \"are you sure?\" That would've raised a flag. Our bill was $144 and they had the decency to ask for tip. I gave $5 for the kitchen staff and others that weren't involved as I know they are a pool tip environment. Honestly, my night was completely ruined during and after that. Table was already small, and they literally PACKED the table with skewers I didn't even have space to eat. I know Chinese owned restaurant don't usually have \"the keg service\" but come on...make some common sense for your customers at the least."}
{"text":"Small establishment located on Main Street Unionville. It took over that little mexican place that used to be there. Very cute location, no wifi great client service.  We got a little too excited when we were there are it is all tapas. We wanted to try everything annnnd boy the attempt was real  Some of my favourites were the honey chicken wings, okra, and DEFINITELY the scallops. Drinks menu is limited but still has the basis. Everything has this dry rub that I do enjoy, however because we ordered too much meat it had basically the same taste in which I needed to cleanse my palette.   Overall if I was in the area I would definitnely come again!"}
{"text":"I seriously have no idea why anyone would give them less than 5 stars. Please trust me over those other reviews.   The atmosphere is so cute, please see pics.  The skewers are suuuuuch a reasonable price compared to places like Zakkushi or Izakaya Ju (they are $6 for 4), and they taste amazing.   The grilled oysters are SO GOOD PLZ TRY IT it's the best grilled oyster I have ever had.  They provide free bottled water and a selection of drinks available in a little fridge bar at the front.   Also at 10pm they turn it up- dim the lights and turn up the music. So the atmosphere is even more cool.  I am calling out all the ppl who gave less than 5* for having bad taste :$"}
{"text":"Nice location and atmosphere. I went on a saturday for lunch. Skewers taste good on first few bites but after awhile everything taste the same. Maybe because they are using the same spices on all kind of meats. The braised pork rice tastes good. Minced pork dry noodle is so so. I'll skip the edamame. I feel it's too much seasoning. I kinda wish they serve hot tea at the end to wash down all the saltiness from the spices."}
{"text":"Tiny place so wait time was relatively long. But if you're willing to wait, they offer a good selection of authentic char-grilled skewers. There was a \"hot-plate\" on each table that kept the skewers warm. Chat bar offers a wide range of alcoholic beverages as well as other non-alcoholic options (pop, Wong lo Kat, aloe drinks, energy drinks). I thought it was neat that you could just go up to the bar/fridge and take out whatever you wanted by yourself.  The relaxed, laid back ambiance of this place can be attractive for younger crowds, but may not be suitable for children and older adults. The price is moderately expensive, but each skewer has quite the flavor. Opens late, so if you're looking for a place to relax for some food and drinks, chat bar is a great option"}
{"text":"Love the decor of this place! The design of the restaurant is actually really smart. When you enter the restaurant, the front has an open window of the kitchen so you can see them cooking the skewers - this is smart as all the smoke and skewers spice cooking smell stays in the kitchen and doesn't carry out to the seating area in the back. Also, their front counter table where the cashier is, is actually their fridge! Smart use of space. Also, their drink selections are in the fridge and it is in a serve yourself type of fashion which is one, neat for customers to see the whole selection of what they have, and also secondly smart because the staff save time/trouble of serving drinks and don't need cups. They even have bottle openers for the beer so customers can open it on the spot themselves.  Food was good! All the skewers essentially have the same flavor as they are all marinated and cooked in the same spice. The skewers weren't too spicy, and really tasty. Lamb ($5.95 for 4 skewers) - In my opinion the lamb skewers tasted the best. Beef & Yellow/Red Peppers ($5.95 for 4 skewers) - The beef meat was really tender, and the yellow and red peppers added a nice sweet crunch to each bite with the beef. Pork Intestines ($5.95 for 4 skewers) - This was really really good. I didn't like how they stuffed garlic inside the pork intestines, but I understand it was there to help pick out the flavor. The pork intestines were really crispy and tasty. Chicken wings with honey ($5.95 for 2 skewers) - These were marinated really good, grilled perfectly. Probably the only type of skewer that has a separate flavor other than the usual spice. Okra ($3.99 for 2 skewers, 4 on each) - These were grilled a bit too long and the okra weren't that crunchy but soft. Really flavorful though. Cabbage ($3.99 for a plate) - The cabbage was cooked in the same spice as the skewers, along with some chili oil which made it really oily.  Garlic Clams ($8.95) - This was a good deal because there were a lot of clams! Strong in garlic taste. Grilled garlic Scallops ($12.95 for 5 pieces) - The scallops came served on the clam shell with vermicelli and garlic and topped with a slice of chili pepper. The pepper is SUPER spicy so if you can't handle hot, don't eat the scallop with the chili pepper. The scallops were slightly overcooked in my opinion.   I really like this place! Definitely would come back with a group of friends - a nice place to chat and chill."}
{"text":"I like the service here. I wouldn't necessarily label it as professional, but personable. The guy seems to be enjoying his job and having fun with it which is contagious. Keep the kid happy.  The food was great. Ordered quite a lot of food for just 2 people. Too much for sure. Squid, beef, lamb, chicken joints, chicken wings, mackerel, a slice potato dish that was hilariously named potato with tin foil on the receipt, and grilled shrimp.  Everything was delicious. The mackerel are pretty intimidating looking, but you can eat everything including the bones.   The two dishes I was less of a fan about were the shrimp and potato. The main reason being that there was too much garlic. May have also been the reason for me being gassy for the rest of the night.  Otherwise, pretty good places for late night skewers if I don't want to drive too far."}
{"text":"nice location?good food?Chinese style bbq?especially lamb. price is a little bit high. but there are lots of choices on spicy food"}
{"text":"A cute spot at Main Street Unionville. The restaurant is inside a small brick house, the decor is hipster with hanging light bulbs. The design and ambiance is great. Limited table and seating space as the place is small and cozy.   The restaurant specializes in BBQ skewers. The menu had a wide selection of meats, veggies and seafood skewers. Most of the items on the menu has cardamom spices on it. You will be limited if you are not a fan of the spice. The items that stuck out to me were the BBQ corn, honey chicken wings, and the pork skewers. We also ordered the spicy pot and it was delicious. You can add spiciness to any skewers if you wish.   It is quite loud in this restaurant due to the echoing brick walls, so if you want an intimate dining experience, I would not recommend it.   I would need to deduct points for their service. They were under staff and only had 2-3 waiters working at the time. The staff did not understand much English so it was hard to communicate with them."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly sure why this place only got 3 stars, but I would definitely give it 4 stars.   Pros -Lamb skewers were DELICIOUS, seasoned well. Would order again.  -Pork skewers were extremely tasty, also seasoned well. Would order again.  -Spicy beef noodle soup was extremely good, not too spicy, and a good amount of meat for the price. -Decent service, they replaced dirty plates, were polite. A little on the quiet side and mostly spoke Mandarin. They did understand my dish in English though, when I asked about it. My mom asked about it actually, and I mentioned the dish itself in English and she understood.  Cons -Food didn't come around the same time. My dad and brothers meals came first, followed by mom's 5 minutes later, followed by mine 10-15 minutes later. -Garlic shrimp was mediocre. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that flavourful. Someone on yelp said it was amazing so I thought I'd try it... I'm not sure if it wasn't done how it normally was done or what, but it wasn't amazing. I wouldn't order that one again.   Overall, I am going to start visiting places that are 3 stars because I always judge and visit 4 star places. But sometimes 4 star places are 3 stars in my opinion, and in this case, Chat Bar is at least a 4 star to me."}
{"text":"I came here with one of my close friends, because we were both hungry and wanted to try out a new restaurant. After looking into a few places, we decided to come here.   Definitely a love/hate relationship with this restaurant (no, I'm not joking ha), and this is why:  Pros: - Amazing food, although it seems like small portions when you order, it will rack up at the end  - Really good music - One of the best looking bars in the area  - Kind waiters - Good place to come with a bunch of friends and catch up - Cool concept  Cons: - SUPER slow service (yes, it was that bad) - Dirty washrooms (trust me, you should hold it in until you get home) - Expensive - Floors are super sticky  All in all, if you want to have a good time with good music, food, drinks and vibe with your friends, this is your spot. However, I advise you do not use their washrooms and don't expect amazing service.  P.S. CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"I quite like Chat Bar, a bbq place where bbq food is cooked and ready to serve.  Don't get me wrong, it's not just a bbq place because they do serve other types of food as well.  The selection of food is pretty good.  Some of my favorites are Oysters and ribs.  Another good point about Chat Bar is that it is opened until pretty late, so you can go there when everywhere else is already closed. The only parts that I don't like about Chat Bar are that it only accepts cash.  And you have to pay for water.  When it comes to drinks, it's self-serve at the front of the restaurant where the fridges are situated.  Oh, and the restaurant is pretty dark, so I find myself having a hard time reading the menu.  That's all."}
{"text":"A cool, little spot in the heart of Unionville. Prices can add up quickly, especially if you order fancier items like oysters and shrimp, but you can have a very affordable meal if you stick to more basic items.  We had the following: *beef skewers - they were not rare but they were nice and fatty and consequently, quite juicy! *pork belly - can't go wrong with pork belly *pineapple - probably one of my favourite things! *grilled squid - tasty, sliiightly overdone but not too much *garlic shrimp - super garlicky, decent quality shrimp, but not for lazy eaters who don't like to deal with shells *grilled eggplant - super delicious!  I find that generally speaking, a lot of the meats are heavier on cumin, because it's Northern (north east? west?) Chinese food. I'm not a huge fan of cumin, but the amount they use here is quite tolerable. The food also tends to be salty and VERY garlicky. We love garlic, so that wasn't a problem.  Some of the skewers - in our case, the beef, pork, and pineapple - were kept warm on a slate with some tealight candles under it, which is kind of nice. I originally thought we were going to get to grill our own food, but the slate is there more to keep things warm, and I was ok with that.  I've heard good things about the spicy hot pot but I'm not a fan of numbing spice or hot pots in general, so we probably won't try. I've heard that the rice dishes are also nice.  Our neighbours had oysters, which I definitely want to try next time!"}
{"text":"A small tapas style bar that serves up lots of meats on skewers.  You can easily over order given the large variety and that each order is 4-6 skewers. I had the lamb, chicken cartilage, pork, squid, chicken wings, baked oysters, okra, egg plant, rice cake...See how easy it was to pile it up?!  Skewers were well seasoned and packed with flavour. Usually it's cumin, like for the lamb.  It's a great atmosphere for hanging out with friends, having a beer and chatting it up.  They only accept cash which is inconvenient.  Beer is pretty much self serve.  You can order it on paper but you need to go to the fridge to get it yourself anyways.  I was with two other friends around 9pm on a Tuesday and there was still a 30 min or so wait.  Plus the seating is limited.  I'm already looking forward to coming back but not looking forward to waiting for a table.  The servers keep walking by with heaps of skewers from the kitchen and pass the line up. It just taunts me!"}
{"text":"Ahh, I'm a little conflicted about what to rate this restaurant. To start, they open only for dinnertime (starting at 4 pm) but close late at 2 am, so it's perfect for a late night snack! But....this restaurant is actually very small, and they do not take reservations. So there is usually always a line up ranging from 10 minutes to an hour, which is a huge drawback for many people.   As it was my 4th time there, we walked in and surprisingly there was no wait time for a table of 2. We were seated immediately. Then, as soon as we started looking at the menu, a server came up to us and told us we took someone else's spot, as there was apparently actually someone else before us (but they went out of the restaurant). The server was hovering around our table and we felt totally awkward. She then asked us if we could get up and give up our seat. We totally wouldn't have minded but the server was being a bit rude so we hesitated. After a while she came back and just started hovering around our table again... by this time it was just an awkward ordeal so we offered to give up the table and head somewhere else. She then said it was okay for us to stay, but by then we already felt quite unwelcome.   We decided to end up staying as it was quite late already. We ordered our food, and the service for the rest of the night was pretty good. If you order skewers, they are placed on a hot plate with candles underneath to keep it warm, which was a nice touch.  If you want drinks you must go up to the front and get it yourself. Water is also not offered (I think you have to pay for it, not sure).   The food was quite good but also overpriced. For 2 people the bill came up to around $70. Overall, I would have given the food a 4 star rating but I took one star off for the price and one star off for the horrible customer service seating incident. I would go back, but there are better late night barbecue joints out there that are cheaper and less of a wait time."}
