{"text":"Well you see you guys call yourself the fan club but let me tell you I am not a fan at all. The whole place smells like a fish, there's a creepy guy there named rj that looks like Brian peppers (id avoid him). Next time I'm in the dirty ding I'm taking a huge dump on your back patio!!!!"}
{"text":"The bar is a nice and the food is great. Staff is always friendly. I generally will go there for lunch but have also had some catering done. Definitely a place to check out if you're hungry. Portions are large and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"This review is solely based off bar. We stopped by for a Friday happy hour. The prices are amazing. $1.00 dometic drafts. $1.50 domestic bottles and $2.75 crafts. Can't beat it. It's clean has nice TV's and good service. Wish I had found this place sooner."}
