{"text":"Such a gem--I wish George had more signage for his great little lunch spot, its soo hard to find and can easily be overlooked. EASIEST way to find him is to park on Camelback at the Family Wealth Advisors place which is directly across the street from City Hall. You can get in from the shoe department in Neimans or through the kids department in Dillards, but parking on Camelback will take you straight in! 

I love George, he is such a happy man and remembers everybody, I love to see that in business owners. You can get anything from chili, to a pulled pork sandwich, to a cheeseburger to a hearty turkey sub here and everything is so fresh. I LOVE his rosemary and his pesto spread, both are a must! And he's got an interesting selection of candy, gum, chips, greeting cards and SF memorabilia, go see George!"}
{"text":"This place is the best.  It is situated in the bottom floor of  the office tower on the corner of Goldwater and Camelback where I work. The owner is named George and he and  his family take great care of all of us employees in the office tower and the attached mall (fashion square).  George and his kids make sure to know everybody's name and greet you with a smile every time you come through the door.

They serve breakfast food including burritos, bagels, and french toast.  For lunch they have a full menu of sandwiches, a couple of soups a day and some salads.  They also have prepackaged snacks, gum and drinks to keep us workers going throughout the day.

Of course, as the name would suggest they also serve coffee, teas, and your usual fancy coffee drinks.  They seem to make a point to try to remember what your usual order is as well.  

My company gets breakfasts and lunches catered from here and even if we end up with a last minute order for bagels for 10 people, they always try to accommodate us.  The food is good, filling and served from people who really care about making their customers happy."}
{"text":"This place is more than just coffee as the name implies.  They actually have a full menu of food items for breakfast and lunch, which makes it stand out from some of the other coffee shops in the area (ahem, i'm talkin' to you Starbucks).  

You can get great coffee, bagels, breakfast burritos, french toast, sandwiches, soup, salad, cookies, muffins and more! Not bad, huh?  I like coming here over quite a few coffee shops because you can actually stay awhile.  You can have lunch, get some work done on your computer and people watch- makes for a great day!"}
