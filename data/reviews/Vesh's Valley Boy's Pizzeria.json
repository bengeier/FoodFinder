{"text":"My family and I actually did not care for the pizza. The crust was not very good and the sauce was nothing to brag about. However, the breadsticks were excellent and the wings were not bad."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Eat in, take out or delivery. The business has gone through its fair share of owners, but hopefully vesh is here to stay."}
{"text":"I have driven by this shop plenty of times in my life. From the outside it's not that sexy, in fact , I questioned if it was open still. My past camping trip at Raccoon Creek State Park got a lot of rain and I ended up eating there a couple of times. The interior is about as appealing as the exterior(-1), they both need serious updating. I just got a medium pepperoni and sausage both times.. Cooked to perfection, they were. The crust was a little tough, I couldn't tell if it was from waiting on top of the oven for me of if in general. But, I liked it, no penalty star. The best part was going in to pick up the pies and the kitchen is full of hot girls in short shorts, just hangin, ha. All in all, I'd go there again and you shouldn't let the looks deceive you."}
{"text":"I have recently had the pleasure of ordering take out a couple times for lunch at my workplace. Good food, nice employees, good prices, and their location are four things make this place great choice to order some good grub. 

I have tried several items from the menu like the gyro salad, hot pepper cheese balls, fried zucchini, and plain and pepperoni pizza. Simple mouth-watering flavors fill my tastebuds just listing all the good food I've recently tried from here. I also highly recommend the homemade ranch dressing for either dressing your salad or for dipping you pizza or other appetizers. They take advantage of local ingredients and it's the best ranch dressing I've ever had. 

I look forward to ordering more items off their menu and bringing it home soon!"}
