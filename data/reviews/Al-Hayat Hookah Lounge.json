{"text":"I was roaming downtown after a night of cocktails and in search of a hookah bar when Al Hayat popped up on my Yelp search. What can I say? Sometimes I get nostalgic of college days and decide to indulge.  Al Hayat was pretty hard to find though, I wish there was more clear signage. My Uber driver was almost going to just take me back to where he picked me up from! The Hookah hostess was pretty patient though and stayed on the phone with me until we finally found the location.   Al Hayat is tucked away in a (not going to lie) kind of sketchy little plaza. I'm not very intimidated by sketchy seeming places though, so I remained aware of my surroundings and figured I'd still give the place a shot.   The hostess/hookah server was so nice! What excellent service! She even asked if I had a preference in music and opened up the option of selecting the music that was playing. I was given a menu that had an assortment of flavors and finally decided on one. I've been to quite a few hookah bars and this one was about in line with the others in terms of flavor variety. I also ordered some tea which wasn't anything special, but nice to sip on during my solo hookah session.   The only complaints I have is the location and signage and the seating... there's plenty of seating but not comfortable options. I wish they had more variety to their seating arrangements. That may be because of the hookah bars in my hometown spoiling me with plush chairs and couches... but hey, if you're going to be sitting somewhere for a while it should probably be comfortable. Also, with the location some random car rolled up and it kinda took the sketch to another level... may be a good idea to keep the front door shut at night?   I'll probably swing by this place again and see if it's a little more lively on a weekend!"}
{"text":"Al-Hayat is a wonderful hookah lounge. It actually felt like just the name, hookah lounge. They had all sorts of flavors, and while my friends and I may be knowledgable in good flavor combinations, she had us try her flavor combination and it rocked our socks off. I highly recommend you come by here and try a mixture of Bubblegum, Mint, Guava, and White Peach. The only way to describe that flavor was like inhaling a rainbow straight to your lungs.  10/10 will be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome place good prices, chilled with some friends and the Hooka was better then any other Hooka I had and they are always getting to you to what you need and very nice"}
{"text":"We recently went with a group of 7 and had a great time! We weren't sure of the place at first because of the lack of reviews but decided to give it a shot. The girl who helped us was very accommodating and friendly. She kept the hookahs stocked and anticipated our needs. She overheard that we wanted to get a refill and got it ready before we even asked for it. She was also sweet enough to let us play our own music. I definitely recommend the house blend, she mixes it herself and it was the best flavor of the 3 we tried. We will return, thank you!"}
{"text":"Best Hookah lounge in LV. The customer service is perfect and everything about the place is perfect. They attend you fast and with the upmost respect. The hookah itself is really great with multiple flavors to choose from. The space is also roomy and fits a hookah lounge type of environment. Totally recommend this place is you're looking for a hookah lounge."}
{"text":"We came from the he container park. Took an Uber while we were waiting for our table and the door was closed. We spent money in the Uber for no reason and for no hookah. I was very upset bc this was the closest hookah spot and we were willing to stay there for a few hours. They missed out."}
