{"text":"Love this place!  Servers and bartenders were super friendly and helpful.  Awesome date atmosphere and there's a cool open roof patio area or back.  Loved the chewy chips and guacamole made at the table as a starter, the snow cone signature cocktail (which is nice and strong), and the fish tacos and chorizo tacos.  The pork belly shared dish wasn't quite as expected (wasn't crispy like the pork belly you find at Soul) but still good. We loved the mixiote (braised short rib in a banana leaf \"bowl\")--melt in your mouth delicious!!.  I think other reviewers that say the tacos are super tiny are forgetting that they're only $3-$4 each, which is the same as you'll find at Bakersfield and RuRu's, etc.  Overall, very pleased.  Great addition to Plaza Midwood and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The worst service I have had in Charlotte. Our waiter completely forgot my order, then put in the wrong order taking double the time. When the check came, he advised that he had taken off my actual order and marketed it as \"free\", only to realize I was being charged for the food that he incorrectly wrote down. In addition, our water cups were constantly empty and the food was salty and overpriced for portion size."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner, it was completely empty. It was a nice touch that they made fresh guac right in front of us. Food was a bit overpriced for what you get. I got the carne asada, the sirloin was overseasoned and the toppings weren't fresh. (cilantro was completely wilted)."}
{"text":"Glad to see that Comida is consistent. Consistently terrible. This place still blows. What's next for The Penguin? Comida surely isn't here to stay. Come on PMW. You can do better!"}
{"text":"We visited on Saturday for dinner. They were booked for reservations but had several places at the bar to sit, which is always a good option for two especially if you like chatting it up with the bartenders, who were great on this visit. 

Renovation of the old Penguin was well done. We liked the wide windows facing the neighborhood. The new enclosed, open roof patio opens in April and looks cool. The fact that they kept the old Penguin sign was a nice touch to keep the history. 

The drinks were great.  The jalapeño margarita was a winner.  We went the small plate route for food. Nachos, tacos, octopus.  The nachos are not your typical nachos .... rich flavors ... a must.  The tacos and octopus were good, but pricey.  Next visit we will try the main dishes. 

I love the new blood in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood.  I suspect the menu will change as time goes on to reach a balancing point where the portions match a reasonable price point. Comida needs to turn the price down a notch in order to gain some traction after the initial buzz dies down. It has a lot of potential and we look forward to our next visit to try the mains on the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Put your thumbs and index fingers together to make a circle. That is the size of their $4 tacos. I've had upscale Mexican before (think El Vez in Philadelphia) but this was truly laughable. Way overpriced for their small portion sizes. My friend and I ordered one drink, chips and salsa to share, and two tacos each. The drinks and the chips and salsa were nothing to rave about and once we saw the size of the tacos we knew we had to leave. $50 plus tip later we were still hungry and very pissed."}
{"text":"Got seated right away at the bar. Service was good. Drinks and food were both good. There are two huge downsides to Comida: the price and portions. The tacos are tiny. You need about 4 tacos for a meal for one, and they are each approximately $5.  Drinks are $10-$13. Very overpriced, especially considering you have fantastic Mexican food nearby (Three Amigos, Sabor, etc.) that is significantly lower in price."}
{"text":"We popped in on a Sunday at 4pm or so, and it was ok. I really wanted to love it, though! The service was very slow (restaurant was half empty and it took a server 10 minutes to get over to us), and the entrees weren't spectacular. I'm great with small plate restaurants/shareable restaurants if the food is awesome (like Kindred), but nothing made me want to come running back. The chewy chips were good... ha. I just think for $60, which was the guac and chips, two entrees and wine/beer...and it wasn't amazing.

Editing to add that per other reviewers, I fully knew that it wasn't a typical refried beans/enchilada place - I didn't go there expecting \"Mexican\" food. It just wasn't great - the food wasn't flavorful, the portions were teeny (and I'm a big fan of Kindred and Soul - I'm good with small plate places) and the service wasn't great. I'd like to see something better go into this spot in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place does not get the recognition it should, and in my opinion 3 stars is an understatement for this establishment. The food was amazing and well put together, the margaritas were refreshing and made with real ingredients and the service was spectacular. Friendly staff who really care about your tapas experience. Went on a Friday night thinking it would have a wait but to my surprise it was nearly empty. This was shocking to me considering how incredible this place was. Great authentic Mexican flavors, I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Get the octopus.

Our server was lovely, for a start. Some items were on the salty side, but overall, the food was interesting, skillfully prepared, and delicious. Especially the octopus, which was tender and smokey. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I've driven by Comida several times and I've heard many mixed reviews about the restaurant since it opened. I was both excited and weary of trying it for the first time. 

My boyfriend and I started with \"chips\" and salsa. The salsa is probably the best salsa I've had in a long time. The flavor was excellent and it had a great amount of heat, especially compared to other Mexican inspired restaurants who kill the heat with their salsa. However, the fried tortillas were so disappointing and heavy and greasy and filling.... I expected more of a thin, crunchy chip instead of cut and fried flour tortillas.  Apparently you can substitute crispy chips and I'd take this option the second time around. It makes me wonder if they try to fill patrons up before serving since the portions were very small. 

We moved on to our dinner entrees ordering a few tacos- Chorizo, Camarones, and al Pastor. All of the tacos were extremely small. This was the main complaint from friends and others who've been to Comida and it certainly was true. I'm very torn when writing this review because I really believe the food was delicious. My favorite part of my experience was the Chonchinita Pibil- braised pork belly, which I really think was pork shoulder. We split this dish as it was actually fairly large and adequate for two people. The flavors were perfect, slightly nutty with a great amount of spice. My only only complaint with this dish was the lack of carb to accompany the slightly heavy dish. A side of rice or starchy vegetable to soak up the sauce would have been perfect. 

The food, overall, was really excellent. I do agree that the price was not exactly worth the size of the tacos and I did find some areas Comida could have improved in terms of their menu, but I would return. 

I see a lot of negative reviews about this place and that's really a shame since they could be very successful in our neighborhood. Hopefully, they can use some of the constructive reviews to ensure they stay around for a while."}
{"text":"Their food did taste pretty good, I'll give them that. But overpriced is an understatement. Ordered 3 tacos. They were fun sized, about the size of an old half dollar. Not that fun and $4 each. Very loud and cramped, wasn't feeling the place at all. Chairs were painful to sit in. Left hungry."}
{"text":"Not sure why the bad reviews, went there had a great time. I was alone and it was around 4pm not very crowded. My server was very sweet and recommended a couple of things from the menu. I took her advice and ordered a couple of plates. One being a taco an something else from another section both were very good and my drink had a very decent pour. No don't go there in you are expecting dollar taco night or three tacos for 5 dollars but both things I had were great.  I believe the food portion of my bill was 13 dollars..heck I can barely drive through Chick fil a for that. Also if you are a real big eater this might not be the place for you. But the food is tasty and the service was good.....again it's not taco bell"}
{"text":"I sampled multiple appetizers and small plates and all were fantastic, you can taste the love put into this food. Comida will rock your paradigm when it comes to Mexican food. Order a tamarind margarita and the pulpo quemado small plate (charred octopus). I also recommend the nachos jardín and the tamale, oh my god the tamale, get the tamale. Hands down the best tamale I've ever had. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the most underrated restaurants on Yelp due in part to what appears to be a number of reviews form diners who value their meals in terms of dollars per pound.  

The problem with Comida is that it's situated in a neighborhood that while favoring progressive causes (for which persons other than them are required to pick up the tab) desperately resists anything that smacks of gentrification (I.e too expensive to hang out and drink for hours ). Or doesn't have six or seven TV's running sports programs all day.  Thus the 2 star reviews imo. 

Don't get me wrong.  I moved to PM over 10 years ago because I love the hole in the wall places. Unfortunately really good innovative cuisine made on the spot with quality fresh ingredients can't be had for the same price as cheeseburger and fries or the other usual pub staples.  It's great to have another option besides Soul for those nights when I'm willing to lay out a little more of my hard earned money for a great atmosphere and fantastic menu. 

The cauliflower nachos, octopus tapas plate and Cornish game hen (principal plate) were fantastic as were the jalapeño margaritas. My wife and I sat at the bar and bartender was extremely helpful.  We loved the atmosphere (music, lighting, cozy feel).  Don't miss Penguin at all!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails, tacos and small plates!  Everything is delicious and easy to share. The Flor Espanola drink was amazing - I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Comida is awesome!  Great atmosphere, amazing cocktails using fresh squeezed juices and delicious tapas style food. 

Yes the tacos are small but they allow you to try other menu items (tapas/share style). The beef short rib in the pouch was insanely good. Their homemade chips (with guac) are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, very unique and addictive.  Enjoyed all of the menu items we tried and have been back a few times already!

The patio is going to be a hot spot."}
{"text":"To start with the highlights...the decor is great inside. The restaurant has a very cool vibe. The menu and drinks are also diverse.

The challenge with the restaurant for us was the food overall was not amazing, the portions were uncomfortably small (including main dishes) and the prices are high. For three of us, we had a drink each and many dishes. The total bill was $135 and we had a nice night but afterwards all agreed that we needed to go to dinner so we stopped at Akahana for a couple sushi rolls."}
{"text":"The kale and cauliflower chips are amazing, as well as the chile margarita, but the food a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"The less than stellar reviews are pretty on point. Had to go see for myself I guess. 

The waitress was horrible and could not answer basic questions about the difficult to understand menu. Apparently tacos are special every day but she didn't know what they were and never came back to tell us. 

We ordered chips n lentil and queso and the cauliflower nachos which were good but the smallest portions imaginable. 

We left after that n 3 drinks (1 each) and the tab was $65 including tip. Totally ridiculous. We certainly won't be back and I'd suggest not wasting your time."}
{"text":"I would NEVER go back! This place is incredibly over priced and the portion sizes are VERY SMALL, not to mention the strange tasting shrimp tacos. The iPad the server brings when it's time to pay makes the whole process uncomfortable, tipping should be in private. Next time I'll go to one of the MANY much better Mexican places in town."}
{"text":"This place is miserable. Sat on the patio; awkward table arrangements, negative space, and bad lighting (from the street light!) Appetizer was not as described on the menu (ordered octopus with charred avocado...avocado was not charred). The waiter told me they don't do tacos anymore because people kept ordering them instead of larger plates. Um. Ok. Is the chef that conceited that he/she would pull popular items from the menu so he/she could show off fancier entrees? They used to do tacos but whatever. My fancy entree came out wrong. Sent it back and it came out wrong again...but I stuck with it because my friend was halfway through his dinner. The table next to us sat un-bussed and full of dirty dishes the entire time...so did a table across the patio. Place was 3/4 empty at 8:30p on a Saturday. 

I've been three times and it has consistently gone down hill. No more. 

These guys are not good at what they do."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst place In Charlotte. Drinks were good but not worth the price, food and bartender staff were beyond terrible. We were over charged and when we tried to get the bill corrected we got attitude from the bartender. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Quick recap: this place has the ingredients to be amazing, but it's execution is as poor as I have seen in a long time. 

Where to begin. Maybe the most upsetting thing I experienced here was watching one of the cooks clean the fire grill with a brush that rests on the floor. Which you would think having seats facing the kitchen would prevent most unhygienic restaurant practices. 

The prices are high and the food portions are low. You can usually get away with that when the food is top of the notch. The food here is not top of the notch. Not even close. 

Felt like they pre cook the meats and then when they are ordered they let the fire char them up and then serve it. Problem with that is it over cooks the meats. 

It felt like there was flavor there trying to come out but couldn't. Hopefully since this is a rather new restaurant they will only get better from here. But for now I would not recommend this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"First off, the food is pretty good. Even the service (waitress) was pretty good. BUT, when it came time to close out the check, it all went down hill.

Details aside - their table side card reader did not work. The GM came to our table and proceeded in speaking to us like we could not afford the meal. He spoke rudely to my wife out of the gate, and ultimately said he 'did not want our future business'.

Nowhere in the world of professionalism should that statement come out of the mouth of one running a restaurant.

So, if you're willing to roll the service dice to get a high priced small portion meal - which we were - and credit to the chef it was good - then maybe this place is for you, but we will never be back."}
{"text":"Amazing margaritas!  The sour mix is incredible and smooth flavors from the traditional. The chewy chips and guac are yummy. We liked the al pastor taco and the steak taco the best. We also shared the short ribs entree and it was spicy and fall off the bone tender. Overall enjoyed the food and drinks, probably return for drinks and apps instead of full meal. We sat at the bar so avoided wait for tables."}
{"text":"Went to Comida tonight to celebrate a friend's birthday. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgable in the menu. Food was delicious but extremely small portioned for the prices.

They swipe your card at the table (cool! You're up with the technology game). But, when they swipe your card multiple times because they aren't sure if it went through (\"technology\"). We show them on our bank account that it did go through-- because we already see it. The GM walks over and tells us that doesn't matter and they need to swipe it again because it hasn't gone through their system yet. So, he tries swiping again after we give him back our card, hesitatingly. Then, at that exact moment we get a phone call from fraud protection because they swiped our card so many times. 

Needless to say, the GM ends up telling us that we were the \"rude\" ones and that our business was not welcome there ever again. Im not sure why you would ever say that to a customer no matter the circumstance, when you are trying to open a new business.

When really, we just didn't want to be charged $130 x multiple card swipes for tiny tacos. Trust me, he doesn't \"want our business\"-- well we will be hitting up Taco Bell or any other taco joint around Charlotte and it will be my pleasure, 'sir'."}
{"text":"Like another Yelper stated, I really want to love Comida. We ordered margaritas, carne asada, and guacamole. The food itself was amazing.

But the prices and the atmosphere itself were not so great. It was very loud and the seating was super uncomfortable. I understand they're all little plates but man, those prices.

I'd probably return for those delicious chips and guac, and maybe to try another appetizer but probably not order an actual meal. 

Also, our server was super sweet and friendly!"}
{"text":"I give it 6 months before this place goes out of business. Super pricey small portioned, incoherent wait staff. I'll give the last one a slight pass bc they're less than 2 weeks old and I'd rather judge a place on its food. Based solely on that, don't go there. This place might fly somewhat ok at the bottom of a hotel downtown but on Thomas street in plaza midwood? No way. I'd rather get a $5 jamo shot across the street at t-street than pay $11 for a shot here. And the tacos were smaller than my palm and comparable to a dollar taco at sabor but 6x the price. Yuca fries seriously sucked. I never had a yuca fry I didn't like until now. Spare yourself a shitty evening and dine elsewhere. Go to sabor on Hawthorne for similar tacos but much better everything else and cheaper. Go to ru rus on providence for upscale tacos(sooooo much better than this place.)"}
{"text":"Yummy, nice decor and love Latino food! Nice addition to Charlotte and located in old Penguin restaurant in Elizabeth! So excited to have good authentic Latin food here! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. The restaurant is way too small- the bartenders were extremely rude and I really had high hopes for this place! 

The food is mediocre and the tacos are extremely small yet pricey. 

I will not be returning unfortunately"}
{"text":"Went to Comida last night on a date.
I called around 3 to reserve a table, since was suggested on the web site, they call me shortly to confirme it. I don't feel we needed it ,place was never full while we were there, but, it was great knowing they took reservations.
When we came in we walk into an open room very modern, with an open kitchen, we got a half booth in the back against the window, which allow us to see the bar, the street and the whole restaurant, we love the place from the minute we walked in.
Jenna, by the way great server, always there when we needed her, but wasn't always bothering us, she found out that it was our first time there and made excellent suggestions, we were looking for vegetarian options, and they had quite a few; Ensalada de Nopales, by far one of the best nopales salad I've had in Plaza Midwood; Vegetales y Mole Negro, my favorite small plate, delicious grilled vegetables served on a mole sauce with some crema agria on the side; Tamalito Nejo, interesting but was lacking flavor; Flautas, again nothing especial about them, since you couldn't taste the ingredients, and I had the tangerine juice, this is the only reason I don't give a 5 stars to the restaurant. It is a hand squeeze juice, but the flavor it had was like by mistake a spoiled tangerine got in the mix; I choose not to bring it up to the server's attention, but I can't believe the kitchen (or bar) don't taste their product before reaching the tables.
Overall great food, perfect place if you are looking to have a date, an evening with friends or even to sit down at the bar and have a bite, I think I have found my new favorite place in Plaza!"}
{"text":"Great staff, food, and drinks! My girlfriend and I visited Comida over the weekend very skeptical because of the overall rating. But, I read the Charlotte Agenda article about the comparison between Comida and Sabor. I'm thankful we went! First off this is nothing like Sabor and shouldn't be compared. Our server was very knowledgeable and offered suggestions from starters through to dessert and nearly everything was spot on. Everything is scratch made in house and you can taste that, even the drinks and drink mixes. We tried the Vegetables Y Mole Negro (their mole takes three days to make), Carne Asada, and the Grilled Corn for our meals - everything was amazing. The flavors of each dish complimented each other just as our server said. Look forward to going back soon! The only thing I wasn't as impressed with was the churros, but we were also full after apps, drinks, and food."}
{"text":"Our first time dining at Comida was well worth it.  A little on the pricier side, however the items we tried were worth it.  The braised short rib was incredible.  We liked the cactus dish as well if for the novelty of it.  My wife ordered the jalapeño margarita which was better than my mango y chile margarita unfortunately.  We enjoyed our time there before heading on to our next destination.  The payment method was obnoxious, but other than that I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"If it was not for the awesome bartender, I would only give this place a one star. The hostesses are ignorant and rude. We arrived on a Friday night at 9:30 and they told us that they are no longer seating & that we had to sit at the bar and eat. What restaurant stop seating at 9:30 on Friday night?? The tacos came out cold and they were extremely small with barely any meat on them. My wife and I shared four tacos, an appetizer and one Mohito and our bill came to almost $80 with tip. We left and went to Soul Gastro and are again because I was still serving! It's unfortunate that this place will not last. My wife and I eat out almost every night of the week and we pretty much have 99% accuracy rate of calling it. It's a shame, this place could be awesome but they have no idea what they're doing. I felt bad for the poor guy bartender, we could see the frustration he was dealing with. I don't think we will be back in less they make some serious changes."}
{"text":"Great ambience, friendly and knowledgeable service. Excellent fresh cocktails and the chewy chips are crack. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We didn't start off on the right foot.  Hostesses can be a bit frosty. However, the bartenders and servers make up for that.  I love the chips.  But I can't get past the tiniest taco I've ever seen.   And not the best by far.  The guac is pre-made so we skipped that, and I enjoyed the spicy salsa after removing the unnecessary white onions on top.  The gin with tonic and tangerine was a bit sweet for my taste, but the more I drank, the more the sprig of rosemary added to the flavor which I liked.  Lastly, I had the sopa de fideo which was good but I couldn't understand why there was a bread roll in there.  I may try this place again but get different items on the menu."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this space given its history/location and, while it did not disappoint, there are a few areas that I think they could improve upon to become a totally stellar restaurant...

Let's start with the positives (there are several):
-The food is great, we ordered a ton of menu items and all of it was delicious! The guac was the best I've had in Charlotte (super fresh with a generous amount of cumin) and the kale nachos were unexpectedly delightful. Tacos were great as was our entree, but next time I will stick to the small plates because they were filling and super yummy!
-The wine list is pretty diverse and affordable with three different, yet equally delicious, rose options
-I'm not a margarita drinker, but my husband and the friends we dined with are and they were all very pleased with the margaritas
-The location is superb
-It was relatively easy to make a reservation and we didn't feel rushed to leave, which was nice

Here are some opportunities for improvement:
-Our server told us we needed to order an item from every section of the menu to be full and, while we're not that gullible, his comment did compel us to order WAY more food than we needed. We all left stuffed, with doggie bags. In the future I will stick to the small dishes because they're filling, carby, and amazingly tasty!
-The chairs are #uncomfortable... they're made of wire, are far too round and were similar to what I imagine sitting in my kitchen fruit basket would be like 
-While I liked being able to pay via iPad, the whole selecting gratuity with the server right in front of you thing threw us for a loop. We're good tippers, so that's not the issue... the issue is our server told us he had to stay with the iPad (to ensure they won't be stolen), so we had to select the tip amount right in front of him. Also, if memory serves me correctly 18% was the lowest amount you could select... we typically tip significantly higher than that, but what if you receive less than satisfactory service? There should be options to write-in different tip amounts so that patrons have some discretion.

If they replace the chairs and modify the awkward payment situation, I'll definitely up my rating."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has only 3 stars!?  Come on Charlotte, this place has great upscale Latin food for reasonable prices.  No, this is not a burrito or taco joint.  We have plenty of those. Great moles, scratch made tortillas, braised meats, and great vegetarian options.  The pasole was amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Their chips are the most luscious I've ever had.  Fresh juices cocktails are delicious.  Entree menu changes up and is innovative and so delicious."}
{"text":"Brought my family to Comida and the it was great! The margaritas were delicious and I love the tapas style plates. We tried several things and everything was delicious. Portions are small, but we like that we can try several different things and not get \"stuck\" with one big plate. Amazing service! We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Comida has quickly become our new favorite restaurant  in Charlotte for Mexican food. Sure it has other Spanish influences, but this reminds us of some of the best places in Southern California! We love that the tortillas are made in the kitchen in front of you. The guacamole, salsa and chips have great flavor. Everything tastes fresh. Oh, and the cocktails a good too. Over all this is a great experience.

Favorite items: Al Pastor Taco, Sopes and the Gelatina Mosiaco for dessert!

Don't pay mind to some of complaints around small portions: the tacos are as you'd expect in Mexico or legit Mexican restaurants. Tapas are small plates and great for sharing. If you want large portions for little coin try fast food!!!"}
{"text":"Don't know about the bad reviews I think it's because people are expecting a hole in the wall Latin Street food spot.  Go elsewhere for that this is more refined dining.  Cornish hens--delish.  Stewed goat meat--delish.  For the more adventurous palate.  Love it!"}
{"text":"So glad I decided to try this place despite some of the reviews. Love it! Decor, music, and vibe are great. Tapas style tacos are the perfect bite. Price point matches quality of the food. No complaints here...I will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"First off, Comida is in the building where the Penguin use to be, as of yesterday, there wasn't a sign. The interior is awesome, who ever designed it did an awesome job, but I can't really say the same for the experience with our food.

We took other review's advise and went in ordering a handful of different things. We got:
Guacamole- it was awesome
Salsa- good, pretty generic- but if the soft tortilla chips are not hot, it leaves you lacking
Tacos- all of them- we could only eat 3 of the 7, and when it was all said in done, we didn't really \"like\" any of them, we just ate them because we ordered them. The tacos we couldn't eat were either way to salty (chorizo), bitter (carnitas), over cooked (chicken), or just plain gross (carne asada). I get the entire point is to try a bunch of different things, but when you only get 3 bites of a taco (because they are so small) and you can only want to eat 1/2 a bite.... it doesn't make for a positive experience. 
Sopas- really great, the brisket was wonderful

Price- way to expensive for not liking 1/2 your food"}
{"text":"My husband and I live near by and frequent little spoon so we were excited to try Comida.  The food was good, staff was nice, the music was lovely... I give it a solid 4-stars for now because there was nothing that really blew my socks off, but I'm hoping there will be in the future!

The chewy chips + spicy salsa were absolutely delicious.  I got the Tamal and my husband got the Barbacoa.  My Tamal was awesome but I wasn't a huge fan of the mole sauce (may just be a personal taste), so I used leftover spicy salsa from the appetizer.  The Tamal presentation (in a bowl drenched in mole) wasn't my favorite... I ended up using a side plate to actually eat it.  The Barbacoa was excellent and my husband had no complaints, it was a good sized dish and tasty. 

Look for more from me on Comida in the future."}
{"text":"I really, really want to love Comida. It is close to where I live, it's in a vibrant neighborhood and their menu looks delicious. However, for me, it falls a bit short.
Definitely start your dinner with a tasty cocktail. This was probably my favorite part of the meal. They have great tequila and they'll make your margarita to your taste...Spicy, floral, sweet, etc.
The menu is comprised of snacks and small plates priced from $3-$20. Unfortunately, these small plates are REALLY small. They make Good Food on Montford look like an all you can eat buffet. They also have a few more \"entree\" like options in the $20-$30 range, but they are al a carte, so you'll need to add-on some snacks to make a more rounded meal.
I did like their cactus salad and their guacamole. They also had some decent octopus. Otherwise, for me, it was a bit bland and over-fussed. I guess I prefer to have it simple and delicious. Just because you have 6 (tiny) weird things on a plate doesn't mean a foodie will think it is tasty.
I would recommend going for cocktails and an appetizer before hitting up a restaurant with a more cohesive and flavorful menu."}
{"text":"We tried the chewy chips and salsa, the kale nachos, and the birria de lengua. The flavors are complex, rich, and curiously satisfying. I particularly enjoyed the heat and rich consomme from the birria. However, the prices are steep, and I get what they're going here for. They're taking Mexican food, and trying to kick it up a notch. The presentation is nice, the decor and ambience of Comida is very warm and inviting. But the food just isn't worth the price. I much rather go to one of the several authentic Latin restaurants down Central Avenue, with equal depth of flavor, diverse menus, and of course better sized portions. After spending $20 myself here for lunch, I would have expected to have left with a full stomach. Instead I left with a tinge of regret that I was still hungry."}
{"text":"So we got to try Comida last night.  We opted to sit at the bar and we weren't disappointed.  Disco Jen was our bartender and she was fabulous!  The decor is easy and the staff was great.  I liked the overall vibe.

I had read several reviews about the size of the tacos with one reviewer even referring to them as the \"micropenis\" of tacos.  Snicker snicker.  Okay, that was a little humorous.  But let me say this; are the tacos small?  Yes, but they are very well done and the point of this restaurant is more of a tasting menu.  Micropenises = bad; Comida tacos = great!  The meat is of very high quality and the corn tortillas are great and do not fall apart at the slightest bit of moisture.  You won't get that at many other subpar Mexican restaurants.

Now, the cocktails.   We ordered the jalapeño margarita, tamarind Margarita, the Machete and the Sandia.  The only one I really liked was the Tamarind Margarita, but that's only because I'm kind of particular about my boozy cocktails.  I think that's just personal preference.  They were all very well made and we loved watching the barbacks doing all the fresh juicing for the cocktails.  It doesn't get fresher and better than that.

We really enjoyed our visit and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in North Carolina by far. The pork belly is insanely delicious. Wonderful service. Great wine selection. Will come again!"}
{"text":"I'd been planning to drop in to Comida for about a month before I finally made it there for dinner.  Before going, I read the reviews - mixed as they are - and felt like I had a handle on what I would be getting that night.  I was wrong, and I'll  try to explain where my expectations were off.

Comida is located in the old Penguin building.  I describe it as such for two reasons - 1) if you're from Charlotte or have lived here for a few years, you probably dined at the Penguin before.  2) Comida has almost NO signage.  The only signage on the outside of the building is white lettering on the glass door - very hard to see.  

The interior design is beautiful - lots of glass and chrome.  Unfortunately the chairs that are so aesthetically pleasing are really not made for comfort.  These wire chairs with leather pads feel like you're sitting on a wire basket - not pleasing.

The menu is not intuitive.  There are different categories - snacks, tastes, tacos, small composed plates and plates for 2.  It's hard to tell from looking at the menu how much you should order - and the serving staff was not particularly helpful.  They suggested that ideally you would be with a large group so that you can order one of everything. Okay, that would be great...but there are only 2 of us.   She didn't give us much more direction.  

Here's what I learned:  the guacamole is made to order and is served with chewy chips (really not great for those who suffer from tmj) and is sufficient for 2.  The tacos are very small - think 2-3 bites.  I would guess that I would eat 6ish of these if that were my meal.  The small composed plates are on the large size of small plates - I would recommend 2 if that's your full meal.  

The food itself was beautifully presented.  They score major points for how it looks. That being said, I thought the flavors were mostly lacking.  The tacos we tried - chicken tinga and carne asada - were both fairly dry.  The guacamole was freshly made, but was heavy on the lime and lacking other spice.  The tamal was also fairly dry (but very pretty).  The standout for the night was the grilled vegetables with mole sauce - holy mole, that sauce was tasty!! 

Overall, I didn't love it.  I wanted to - they just didn't deliver for me."}
{"text":"This is advanced for Charlotte. Understand what type of place you are going to. Not a typical mexican joint.

Smaller portions/tapas with a lot of attention to detail on the food. 

The owner is from LA with experience in the D.C. market. 

Support this local spot and enjoy something good and different in the city of Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I love crispy pork skins.  Comida has good crispy pork skins. I also tried the Spanish Octopus, but it was too juicy.  My wife got the large, overstuffed meat taco.  She said it was splendidly scrumptious.  I will definitely be back soon to try some other food.  Prices are outrageous.  Dining area too dim."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful. Very nice and very helpful when trying to figure out the menu and the interior was such an upgrade from the penguin (previous restaurant). However, it being such a small space and a ton of reflective glasses, it is very loud and very obnoxious to try and have a conversation with someone. I wasn't very impressed with their food either. The \"chewy chips\" are just corn tortillas deep fried and their tacos and very small and not very tasteful. I feel as if everyone should try this place out, however, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Decor is great, food was flavorful, drinks were delicious, service was stellar. So why only two stars? Portions. 

This menu is basically full of $5-$30 amuse-bouches. You can't even share the tacos. They are three bites tops. You can use your iPhone as your plate. Three of us went to dinner and we each had a drink. We got a smattering of things in the menu including main dishes (which are also keeping with the tiny theme). The bill was over $140 without tip and we all decided to go to dinner right after since we were still starving. 

Until they make a serious change in either price or portion size, I won't be back. Not even for the delicious (and also tiny) jalepeno margaritas."}
{"text":"Great authentic Spanish and Latin tapas. Best we have found in Charlotte. Be sure to ask for the taco options of the day as they are not listed on the menu. Be sure to get You ur chewy chips!"}
{"text":"Had an early dinner on Easter Sunday with a friend.  We didn't have reservations but there was plenty of room and we opted to sit at the kitchen bar.  Love the decor.  Space is small so when I come back at a peak time I'll make a rez.

Taylor, our server, was fantastic and we pretty much ordered everything she recommended.

Drinks: 5 stars.  We tried the tamarindo marg, traditional marg, spicy marg and the sandia.  Everything was spot on, refreshing, flavorful, and pretty too!

We had the guacamole and fried garbanzos to munch on first, loved the chewy chips and the guac was well seasoned.

We each had a taco and split one of the larger tamale plates and shared the chai dessert.  Yes, the tacos are tiny.  But also, they are beyond flavorful!  We loved the tamale dish as well and the dessert was well spiced.

We ended up paying $65 each including 20% tip and each had 2 drinks. Definitely not going to replace Sabor's taco Tuesday's but for an upscale Mexican experience I will be back.  The menu is extensive and we were eyeing other dishes we'd like to try.  We had no issues with the tablet checkout, although it was a bit cumbersome to fumble around with the tablet, it was easy and paperless."}
{"text":"My friend's and I were looking forward to celebrating  their impending marriage this weekend with a lovely dinner at Comida. However, that changed when they decided to call and cancel my reservation after I made it over a week ago in favor of a private party. Now, I'm left with handful of days to regroup and few other comparable options available since it's last minute. I'd definitely think twice before going here since they don't really care to honor reservations and only offer up lame apologies."}
{"text":"Not your typical Mexican restaurant and it's not trying to be! 

Cool atmosphere. Extremely creative drinks and other menu items.  Wholesome farm to table, I think.  Amazing chips!!! They make them in house and they are incredible. Delicious Guac!  

Prices are a little high, but worth it for the art. 

Portions are perfectly sized - most restaurant portions are way too big but these are small enough so you can enjoy the chips and s multiple course meal without filling up. 

Get the beef short ribs served in a pouch of corn husks. 

Make a reservation - there is always a wait!"}
{"text":"Giving this place two stars because I had good service, but even that won't bring me back. Never again. This place has GOT to be a joke

Portion sizes are crazy small. Alright, sure, it's a \"tapas\" joint, but why do those exist? Can someone please explain to me why would anyone want a plate of food that you could finish in two to three bites? For over ten dollars?!?!

The service was good but let me tell you, they care about the silliest things. We got two new plates with silverware and a gentleman walked by and asked if they were used. We said no and he replied with \"oh, let me go polish these for you\". Okay, cool, but really? We don't need that. And all plates come to your table warm.

Is this what Charlotte is coming down to? Small portion sizes, service to please people with ridiculous standards, and high prices all from restaurants supporting gentrification?

I would never recommend this place to anyone unless you have unrealistic views of how you should be serviced at a restaurant and if you have a stomach the size of a grape. Oh, and if you like spending over $50 on just yourself for dinner."}
{"text":"Let me start with saying I'm embarrassed that I haven't eaten here sooner. I live in the hood and can walk but the negative reviews have honestly kept me away.  The food is very unique, I'd say modern Mexican.  But nobody's getting rice and beans here. We started with the sopas and barbacoa.  The corn cake was a great texture, crispy yet soft. Next came the shrimp with carrot mole...just get it, you're welcome.  We also ordered the pork belly. I'm not typically a huge fan of this dish but ordered it for my husband. I loved it! Scooped up the spicy sauce with the homemade tortillas, fantastic! It was also crispy yet soft (fatty like pork belly always is), but totally different than any other restaurant that serves this dish. And we enjoyed this with spicy jalapeño margaritas, what's not to love?! And all the reviews that say no one is getting full, I'm stuffed. If you ask the staff, they will help you order, it's what they do.  Thanks to Travis for making a great experience!"}
{"text":"Started our night putting our name in at Soul. 2 hour wait, so we headed to Comida for a Margarita and snacks at Comida 

Had a wonderful evening at comida. Drinks were on point (alert: any drink with jalapeño WILL be spicy. Really spicy) and the food was fantastic 

There are a lot of posts that mention the expensive guac. It was \"market price\" at $8/Avocado, and made table - side, which is always appreciated 

Food was fantastic.  Carrot mole, this is where it's at. Chorizo.... Amazing. 

Great. Night with fantastic food. We will be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for excellent service, quality, authentic Latin American cuisine, and a great atmosphere, this is the place. We go here consistently and everything they have is great. Everything we order is a flavor explosion of quality, clean, local ingredients. Also, the chips and guacamole are hands down the best I have ever had. This is a real Latin restaurant with an on-site chef who cares about his food.

I know some of the reviews are critical of Comida, but I think it's about expectations. If you are looking for cheap, oily, bulk, Americanized Mexican food, there are plenty of those places catering to Americans in the area. This is not the place. Comida is the real deal."}
{"text":"The food is top notch, very authentic. It is expensive, but for a reason. The margaritas are amazing."}
{"text":"Came in around 11 PM on cinco de mayo to get some tequila and maybe a bite. I realize it was probably a hectic day for the staff, but I sat there for 10 minutes without receiving any attention or service. The bartender was dealing with a rather drunk older gentleman and getting him checked out. She even came out from the bar to talk to him and give him his bill, all while I'm sitting right next to him waiting patiently for a drink. Some other girl was behind the bar auctioning off a glass of wine and seemed lost in space. Might give this place another try down the road but come on, 10 minutes? Give me a glass of water or say more than three words to me at least. Terrible bartender"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the wait staff & atmosphere.  They educated our party on our dishes.  The food had excellent flavor too.  However, I felt that the flavor was a bit drowned out with to much salt on both of my dishes.  I will definitely go back and continue to support them!"}
{"text":"Central Avenue and Plaza-Midwood are no stranger to Mexican food, but a restaurant that elevates and modernizes the cuisine is a welcome to addition to a neighborhood corner well known for good eats.

Comida aims to fill that space with a menu of items, both large and small, that hint at many traditional flavors and dishes while offering an updated twist on the familiar.

Even the space feels modern and new- with shiny wire metal chairs that are surprisingly  comfortable even as they contrast agains the dark wood paneling and green turf walls.  A long bar in the back is traditional, while a smaller bar with a view into the kitchen offers a newer view - where you can see the dishes prepped and plated continuously.  The space is energetic and inviting, like a good spot to have an amiable conversation with friends.  

The bar puts an emphasis on the margarita, with several takes from traditional tequila with triple sec and sour, to fruit-infused variations, using (separately) flavors of tamarind, jalapeño, and tangerine (all fresh squeezed and rendered in house).  One highlight here: look for drinks marked with crushed ice- you are basically getting a margarita snowball in a cup.  

Don't like Tequila or Mescal? Another option is a smattering of Gin based drinks.  Wine and beer also also options, though the current beer selection of 2 choices (one light and one dark) is a bit sparse.

The food menu currently runs like most new restaurants- from snacks to small plates to share to larger plates and then a few selections appropriate for sharing.  Prices range from about $5 to $25.  There is a taco menu than ranges from $3 - $6 a taco with most of the usual protein choices you know, but there is also a vegetable option with poblano pepper and charred green onion that was a highlight.  All the tortillas are made in house from scratch and have a pleasant thickness and chew to them.  But don't think of these as traditional tacos, they are small enough to be a maximum of 2 bites.  Sadly, my experience with these bite-sized choices was that they were too small to truly enjoy the flavors and seasoning of the meats.  For example, a carne asada with a claimed chimichurri marinade was lacking in flavor.  Another was the chicken tinga- nicely sauced, but was again bland.  

There were plenty of other choices that were hits however- not to be missed is their take on traditional chips and salsa.  Totopos are fresh fried tortillas with a crispy edge but a warm chewy center.  Add a healthy dash of seasoned salt, the end product is very pleasing.  Couple that with fresh made salsa (the spicy was bright and kicking without being over the top) or guacamole and you have a quick start to a meal that is very satisfying.   I also tried the rolled cactus salad with freshly-made ricotta cheese.  Light, but bright and perfect for a warm spring evening.  

Dessert was also quite inspired as well- I had a chia seed ice cream with bread pudding croutons.  The ice cream was nicely done- creamy without being too sweet, and the crispy flakes on top added a nice contrasting crunch to the dish. 

Just be aware, servers are still learning the menu and take all orders on a tablet device.  In all, I find this to be a hinderance as you watch your server continuously tap thru numerous menu screens and ultimately ask you to repeat you order again once they find their place in the interface.  It certainly looks like form over practicality at this point, but I think there is room to improve this as the server team learns the menu and the app.  I also found it a little jarring to watch your server swipe your credit card and hand you the tablet to add a tip while at your table- I like the emailed receipt, but the process needs improvement here.

There's more to explore here and worthy of a couple of trips back.  In all, this is a great addition to the neighborhood but not a dive or cheap eats pick such as it predecessors in this location.  Whether just drinks and some snacks, or a meal over several courses, there is great promise here and I'm looking forward to returning to explore the menu further, over another margarita."}
{"text":"First comment: I really enjoyed the food we ordered at Comida. We started with guacamole prepared table side with chewy chips. Then came flautas, sopes de barbacoa and tamal ahogado. I really loved everything excepting the chewy chips. I know, I am accustomed to crispy chips and these just seemed greasy. 

The reason for my lower rating boils down to two things. I wanted a by the glass wine that somewhat resembled Chardonnay. There were three white wines offered. When asked, the waiter suggested the middle wine and when I asked for a taste, what was brought was something kin to Prosecco - a light sparkling wine, nothing like a Chardonnay at all and he couldn't tell me what the other wines were like. I ordered a scotch.

The other issue was service. What I realized is that at least in the wine department, the server seemed to have not been trained. In addition to the wine problem, we had some trouble getting our server's attention because he was in a discussion with the bartender. Understandable except our table of three was three of three total diners at the time (it was early.) When two others came in, he was busy with them for a while so one of my group wanted to get another glass of wine. We were in a little bit of a hurry so she just went over to the bar and asked the bartender for a refill. He then acted a bit annoyed, said our server needed to take the order (again, there are five people in the restaurant.) He did refill her glass - but really? Why not \"I'll be happy to refill your glass and let your server know.\" Again, I mainly see lack of training.

The entertainment of the evening was when a poor soul walked in and asked if they served fried pickles. (Yes, the Penguin sign is still up but Comida looks nothing like the good ol' Penguin.) He was sad.

This was my second trip to Comida. The first was a private gathering on the patio. Everything was really well done then (still a problem finding a wine I liked.) So, I am not going to let this be a final trip to Comida. I'll try them again and probably order one of those delicious looking margaritas!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I really don't complain but this place just gave me such a bad vibe. I'm a bartender myself in downtown epicenter and the service here was awful. How do you have 5 bartenders behind such a tiny bar and not have one Second to ask me how the drink you weren't even sure you could make me would be. Jameson at my bar is 9$ and even that is pretty high but 11$ for Jameson in plaza midwood is absolutely ridiculous. But of course I wouldn't complain because I understand how some places are, but then I tip 35% on your over priced drink and you don't even have the decency to say thank you, I don't understand. So disappointed. Not one person checked on me or thanked me. I would never go back on the just the fact that a thank you or smile would have been nice. 10 people At the bar, 5 bartenders, and maybe a few drinks to make for tables."}
{"text":"I am not really sure why Comida has such bad reviews, because we have been here 3 times now and each time has been a fantastic experience! My husband and I are foodies, and usually gravitate towards authentic tapas-style spots, so we aren't easy to please....
I wasn't expecting much because of the types of reviews they received, but we were very pleasantly surprised! Fantastic cocktails (and tequila flights), great little munchies and apps, and awesome service! The same waitress has had us each time and she was wonderful!! If you're looking for \"ghetto Mexican\" (as I like to call it), this is NOT your place. If you're looking for super authentic Mexican tacos, re-fried beans, or cheap food, this is not your place. If you want a quick stop for a variety of yummy tapas options, and a great cocktail before enjoying your night, then Comida is for you.
I have an 8-month old, so we don't get many date nights ---which makes them Eve more precious--- but I would gladly come back here.
For all of you yelp-ers leaving the bad, inaccurate, and cruel reviews, I would encourage you to watch the YouTube skit of \"if restaurants reviewed their customers the way they get reviewed on Yelp\". Because YES, you ARE those people!   To the staff of Comida, hang in there; you're doing a great job, and we are very happy to have you as an addition to our hood!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the portions were humorously small. I am always turned off by a place that thinks their food is so fabulous that the customer will pay for whatever they offer. Plaza Midwood is a late night place so the fact that at 10:50 we are being escorted out after paying 50+ bucks for essentially a few apps and the cutest 3 inch tacos I've ever seen unfortunately makes this they last time I come for dinner until the restaurant inevitably closes and the next place that fills this space."}
{"text":"Hmm. Hate to give poor review but I didn't think food tasted good and I left hungry.  Margaritas were great."}
{"text":"just wondering if anyone on here giving a crap review has ever had real mexican food, like.. in mexico. because eating here is just like being there. nothing about american mexican food is authentically representative of the cuisine. tacos are small, because they're handmade, like they make them in  .... mexico. the fillings are plenty, and deliciously cooked, just like they make them in mexico. in mexico, they don't eat boatloads of chips and salsa before a  meal. burritos drowned in white cheese.. not a thing. why eat at another boring american mexican place when there are literally hundreds up and down central to choose from? or maybe you're looking for another hipster pizza joint to round out the wide array of diners and pubs in plaza midwood. give me a break!  this place is legit. the chefs put a lot of love and care into the food, and it's reflected on your plate, and in your mouth. should you pay for this experience? you betcha. engaged diners understand the cost of quality ingredients and thoughtful menus. handmade corn tortillas??? tamarind margaritas ?? made to order guacamole ? sign ME UP. 

for months i've searched this town looking for sopes. no one makes them. comida does. and they are so f*cking delicious, and they are nine dollars. that alone is worth my four minute drive from noda. 

looking for the same old same old? don't try comida. 

excellent service at the bar. inventive desserts, caring and HIGHLY knowledgable  staff (can you tell me how mescal is made or where the corn comes from that your house made tortillas are made from and how the flour is prepared?) , comfortable and updated atmosphere, fun music.  if you're into food, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"I'm trying to be very fair with this review. I did struggle at first with a fancy Mexican inspired restaurant in the old penguin. It's weird to be in there and for the server to immediately ask if there are any dietary issues. \"Are you gluten free? Vegan?\" These questions would never have been asked in the Penguin. It's just strange.

I'm not judging based on that though. That just isn't fair.

I didn't try the drink menu. Honestly, because the drinks were pricey. However, I have only heard really good things about them and I do want to try one some day. They looked beautiful.

The guacamole and homemade chips were delicious. The tacos seems to be the issue. They say it is tapas style, but how do we share small tacos? The tacos were okay. At first it seems reasonable- $5 taco. But you need at least 2 to be satisfied. They are good, but not blown away amazing. 

 It is definitely more of a date place and don't go when really hungry."}
{"text":"LOVE!  LOVE!  LOVE!  Finally, sophisticated SoCal Mexican in Charlotte!

I wasn't sure what to think about Comida based on some of the earlier reviews.  If you are looking for greasy food; this is not the place.

Serving sizes are large, if you get the entrees.  I got the Carne Asada which was cooked perfectly.  The other dishes ordered were the Duck and the Cornish Hen.  Large portions and fantastic seasoning.  The chewy chips and salsa are delish and the Fried Manchego is ridiculously good. 

Fantastic margarita; good price, lots of alcohol, and fresh flavors.

This Californian is happy to have a restaurant like this in Charlotte.... finally!"}

{"text":"Cool little spot in Plaza Midwood. Friendly and knowledgeable staff, great cocktails made with fresh ingredients, and the chewy chips are excellent. I'm looking forward to making it back soon."}
{"text":"I am in defiant disagreement with the negative reviews towards Comida.

To clear up some of the top negative points: 

-I literally ate there yesterday (on a Monday) so either that reviewer went to the wrong restaurant or they changed their hours.
-From what I can tell their wine selection is great so if you can't figure out which wine you like or branch out from your go-to Chardonnay from an extensive and interesting list like Comida's...you should get the margarita anyway because they're phenomenal. 
-The menu is not difficult to follow, it's just not in 100% English and god forbid the Mexican style restaurant uses Spanish words to label the dishes. Nonetheless, you don't need to be fluent in Spanish to figure it out - the waitress was extremely helpful in providing recommendations on what was best on the menu and how she recommended ordering (multiple small plates for sharing).  

She was also helpful for me as a vegetarian, while still providing recommendations for my boyfriend who is meat obsessed.

As for my own experience:

-Not crowded at all on a Monday, and I was personally shocked especially after tasting the food.
-Truly \"cool\" atmosphere...a reviewer mentioned the owner was from LA and you can tell. Excellent music - seemed to be a lot of really good hip hop and rap being played which further added to the just plain cool vibes of the place.
-The food is perfect for sharing which is ideal for Comida as it's the type of place you want to try a little bit of everything.  I loved the flautas and my boyfriend loved the pork belly.
-The chewy chips are different. Yes, they are chewy.  The texture is like leftover nachos but not in a bad way. The salsa was as good as salsa gets. 
-We both had the tamarind and house margaritas.  Both were next level and tasted very fresh (they don't use a commercial mix, they make it themselves and the tequila is patron and something else I cannot remember). 
-They had one dessert which makes choosing easy.  It was vanilla ice cream on this odd type of pastry with caramel sauce.  The pastry was dry but sweet, like the cotton candy of breads. It was intriguing and got better with each bite.

*I've added photos as well so check those out.

Overall I had a fabulous experience.  Were the portions small and the prices high? Yes of course but it was delicious and worth the occasional splurge when you want Mexican food but something that's also elevated.  Think of it as a Mexican bistro.  Traditional dishes but with an added dash of creativity and elegance that you won't find at Three Amigos (which is also an amazing place for traditional large portion meals with lower prices with less creativity and elegance).

{"text":"*Reservations Recommended*
*Upscale Tex-Mex*

We stopped in for dinner last night. We didn't have reservations but they were able to seat us in a relatively quick time-frame. The drinks were good, albeit pricey. 

I had the jalepeno margarita. It was very good, one of the best I've had in the city. To eat we got the guac, nachos, various tacos and the carne asada to share. 

Highlights: 

- chewy, homemade tortilla chips
- carne asada was delicious 
- margaritas
- handmade corn tortillas 

The restaurant is tiny and loud but the food is great. If you like Ruru's you will enjoy Comida. Their back deck wasn't open but I imagine once it is people will love it. I prefer the vibe of Ruru's over Comida but enjoyed trying out the restaurant for the first time."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Comida twice so far and both times the food quality and service have been great. I moved to Charlotte from Los Angeles a year ago and this is the first Mexican place that gets my stamp of approval...and I've tried a lot! The tacos are authentic with tortillas made while you watch. My favorite are the Tinga (Chicken) and Al Pastor. The chips and guacamole are the best!!  They use fresh juice and ingredients in their drinks and offer a wide variety to choose from.  I've sampled most of the menu and there isn't an item I didn't like!  The kitchen is visible from the restaurant and you can really tell the staff is passionate about serving high quality food.  I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"So I was super excited about this place... But not so much now. I gave it three stars for the atmosphere and the vibe. But the prices of food and drinks is way too high! My husband and I were $90 deep and not satisfied with the meal. The food is bland and nothing stood out for us to recommend or go back for! The drinks are also astronomical in price, however, they were at least delicious! Go for the atmosphere but plan on spending a paycheck!"}
{"text":"I applaud Comida! I ate dinner there about 10 days after they opened and was ready to give them a pass on service and timeliness of food, no pass needed! Our wait staff was knowledgeable and well trained. Our food was fantastic! We ordered drinks, guacamole, tacos and octopus, nothing disappointed. I don't want to write this good review because I want to go back and not wait to be seated!"}
{"text":"We celebrated a new job at Comida a couple weeks ago. I have to agree with small portions and a strange vibe on the patio. But guess what? The food was delicious and filling! I am happy to say the cocktails were inventive and surprising. We shared the guacamole, cheese crisp, corn off the cob and steak tacos. The churros are a must and turns out they are gluten free! I would gladly come back to Comida before or after they move to Myers Park."}
{"text":"I love the guac and chewy chips. Only tried the wine and it was great. Minimal options for vegetarians but I did enjoy my small bite. Pricey for the neighborhood but I liked it."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but after reading some of the Yelp reviews and then trying it out on my own I couldn't disagree more! The drinks were fantastic, the food was fantastic, and the service was fantastic.  The chips and guacamole were amazing.  I had the jalapeño margarita and the el burro, both very delicious! If you are expecting a heaping plate of rice and beans smothered in cheese for $10 go to Three Amigos, one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"Before you go here, you need to understand what Comida is and what it is not. If you're looking for giant plates of food covered in melted cheese where you end up taking half of it home, this isn't it. If you want two tacos to fill you up, this also isn't your place. 

So, what is it then? Tapas style menu, sharable plates, composed dishes. The portions are not huge. They are not meant to be. That being said, you're not going to pay prices like say a Sabor, Three Amigos, Paco's Tacos, etc. 

The man-friend and I went for dinner on a Sunday evening. We didn't make a reservation. Pro tip: make a reservation. But, we found two seats at the bar and really enjoyed the atmosphere there. I ordered the jalapeno margarita, Adam got the machete. If you read my reviews, you'll notice I love Mexican food and will order a spicy and/or jalapeno drink wherever I go. I will honestly say, this is probably one of the best jalapeno margaritas I had in Charlotte. The sour mix is housemade. It was just damn good. His drink was the epitome of Instagram worthy. It was like a giant adult snow cone made with mezcal. I'm not the biggest mezcal fan, but I would order this. It was delicious. He had two of those. I switched it up and got a mango chile margarita and asked the bartender if she would make it extra spicy. Good, but the jalapeno margarita is still the star here for me.

I was starving, so I feel like we ate the entire menu. We started with the chewy chips and salsa. Those homemade dipping vessels are a must order. We also got four tacos- shrimp, fish, chorizo, and carne asada. The tacos are tasting size. That means it's like three of four bites. We split all four so we could try them all. The carne asada was my favorite. That being said, we then ordered the large entree type version of the carne asada (it was around $27), refried lentils, and the octopus. All were delicious. Just know this, the octopus has about three pieces. We also ordered the chia seed ice cream. So unique, I really liked it. Four drinks and all that food, our tab was around $115 before tip.

I'm a huge fan of the drink menu. This is a great place to grab drinks and some snacks. If you're super hungry, you'll end up spending some dough. I thought both bartenders working on Sunday were super friendly and helpful with explaining the menu. This is a place where I would prefer to sit at the bar than at a table. 

Other things to know: the parking situation in Plaza Midwood is just not great. Be patient when looking for a spot and make sure to pay attention to the signs. Also, if you remember what this place looked like when it was the Penguin, it'll take you a few moments to process and take it all in on your first visit."}
{"text":"Expensive drinks. Horrible food. Rude service. Could not be more disappointed. Was told by the waiting staff when I politely asked the price of a drink that \"this is an upscale restaurant not some cheap tex mex place\". DO NOT COME HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of great things about Comida since it opened here in Charlotte, and finally got a chance to check it out tonight. I'm kind of a taco snob, and frankly the taco scene in Charlotte has been weak over the past few years.... however- Comida's tacos were awesome!!! 

We also tried the guacamole, which was made to order right by the table- super tasty as well. 

Finished it off with a small plate of grilled Octopus which paired nicely with the grapefruit and other items it was served with.

Anyway, some people have been giving this place mixed reviews, but I think that is just because they are expecting the \"generic Mexican\" food which has been plaguing our state for too long- Comida is much more than that and a fresh taste for Charlotte! 

Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I have never left a Yelp review, but I feel like I need to. I wanted this place to be great. It was everything I wanted in a restaurant...close enough to walk, craft cocktails and Mexican...but I'll never go back. 

Our service was great. The food was decent. Portion sizes were very disappointing. But that's not the worst part. 

My boyfriend ordered a glass of mezcal and when the hostess came to refill our water she accidentally filled his mezcal glass with water. Instead of just replacing it, she chided him for \"letting her do it\" and then walked it to 4 people before the owner/bartender gave us an evil look and poured him a half-full shot glass of mezcal instead of a \"neat\" glass. No apologies, just the feeling of incrimination. 

The food was good, but not spectacular and I had to order a second dish just to feel full. That was after having appetizers, tacos and an entree. I've never had to do that. Ever. 

$150 later for dinner for two, I feel like I was treated like a criminal and I'm still hungry. I'm so bummed because I was so looking forward to this being our new corner bar. No worries...Dish is amazing and Nappy always gives stellar service at the back bar. This former Texan will just have to keep getting her Mexican fix at Three Amigos...which is totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"Wow! Our first time here and it was fantastic! The drinks, food and service were stellar. From the reviews I've read in here people say the servings are small and the drinks are expensive. Regarding the drinks - they are worth every penny! Delicious and STRONG! :) the food is great - we will be back! Thanks for a great time, Comida!"}
{"text":"You guys have to absolutely try Comida! The tortillas, bread, and chips are made fresh in house! All meat is raised locally and vegetables too! And you can taste it in the food. I am from Mexico and this is exactly how my moms cooking is with a dash of fanciness. They are tapas which are small plates so don't be surprised if the portions are small. To start, i ordered the fresh guacamole, it has the perfect amount of habanero to give it that kick every guacamole should have. I then moved to my sopes which had melted cheese. They were absolutely delicious, the meat was so tender and perfectly spiced. My absolute favorite thing was the fish taco. The salsa it has is amazing!!! I also tried the soup and this tasted exactly like my grandmas. The stock was so flavorful and aromatic. For desset, I tried gelatina mosaico which is a fruit gelatin. It reminded me of the gelatin my mom would buy me after in church in D.F. Mexico. It was so sweet and delicious. A perfect dessert. I had the opportunity to talk to the chef who seemed very passionate about what he does. He explained to me that making everything from scratch is a lot more work but definitely worth it which I absolutely agree. Comida is definitely a must try. All the flavors come together so nicely and it's truly worth every penny."}
{"text":"Went to Comida for dinner for the first time with a little trepidation given some ho-hum reviews.  Needn't have worried. This isn't your typical Mexican restaurant - no huge plates of rice and beans - but something quite different: traditional Mexican dishes with a twist,  As well as the guacamole - prepared at the table by our excellent waitress - my wife and I shared 3 small plates (too full after that to order more!); all were exceptional (special shout-out for the sopes) making this a meal to remember.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's new so we decided to give this place a try for dinner.  I was not impressed. This restaurant is ridiculously over priced for what you get. Ordered guacamole, for about $10 bucks you get what appears to be an ice cream scoop and 20 chips, because of the small portion we ran out and asked for some salsa for the remaining chips, why sure you can have some salsa- for $2.50. Tacos are absurdly small compared to other similar places such as Pacos Tacos and significantly more expensive. My friend ordered flautas and there was barely any filling inside.  There are waaaay to many restaurants like this in Charlotte to pay ridiculous prices like this for average food. Unfortunately this place misses the mark.
Yes there will be people that will love it but I think for the majority of folks it's going to be a one visit and that's it type of place because without major changes I just can't see how you walk out of there without feeling like you just got ripped off pretty badly!"}
{"text":"I will give this a 3 star for the ambiance, service, drink options and chips. However, I was overall not impressed.

I am a picky eater...but when I go out for Mexican food, I really want authentic street style tacos. These tacos cost about $4-$5 per taco but they are tiny. All other reviews said this but when my plate arrived I laughed. TINY. Like for a toddler. Two quick bites and you need another one. I ended up ordering three tacos ($15) that were ok-I don't remember tasting much. I also found their taco selections very limited with only one fish taco that was fried.

My friend liked the entrees that they ordered so maybe tacos aren't their thing. I just found for the price, there are such better taco options in Charlotte-Krazy Fish, Sabor etc. 

Service was great-super nice waiter. Chips were unique and worth trying if you go."}
{"text":"Went there following a outstanding review on a blog. One of the MOST disappointing meals vve had. The food is bland.. mostly tasteless.. which they call unique..and over priced. Not a repeat for us."}
{"text":"Oh Comida...Let's chat for a bit.

I sat at the bar during a busy friday night, and waited....and waited.....10 minutes before I was even offered a menu. That's a very disappointing start.

Your atmosphere and your drinks are great....but you're a restaurant, and I am here for one main purpose: to eat.

One word: Salt. Learn to use it. Put it on things, like meat and fish. Add it to things, like salsa and sauces. It is awesome once you try it!! I promise, you'll never go back to not using salt.

I paid about 30 bucks for just myself. 3 tacos, chips and a drink. We're talking about a tablespoon of saltless meat on each taco, some cabbage and a corn tortilla? Please...that's like a 600% profit margin. If I wanted to pay for atmosphere, I'd go to a movie.

You're a Mexican restaurant in one of the hottest hoods in Charlotte, time to start acting like one."}
{"text":"Does not fit in with the neighborhood. Trying to be fair we didn't do our research before going in. We knew it was Mexican and we knew it was tapas. Prices were steep and didn't seem to have a lot to offer. HOWEVER, if you are looking for wine and cocktails, this place looks great for a nice date night or anniversary. If you're looking for tapas in midwood, go to Soul. Staff was kind and helpful."}
{"text":"Everything we had to eat was delicious. We stuck to the small plates and tacos and were not disappointed. The guacamole and chewy chips were the best I've had in a long time. Yes the tacos were small, but that's what authentic tacos are. The flavors were great."}
{"text":"I was excited to check out this new spot in Plaza Midwood as Mexican food is one of my go-tos. We were meeting another couple for dinner but got there a little early to enjoy a drink at the bar. I had the Machete margarita -- tequila, fresh juices over crushed ice, I liked!! When our guests joined us we sat down at a small table in the center of the restaurant, it's very small space so probably not great for groups. We ordered a variety of things off the menu including guac (made fresh at your table) tacos, mussels, and carne asado. All in all the flavors were delicious however in my opinion the portions were small and over priced. Each taco was about the size of the palm of your hand and definitely was difficult to share - three bites tops. Last tip - watch out for the chairs; with a minimalistic look these wire chairs are stylish however aren't very comfortable and may get caught on your clothing . One of our guests ripped his shorts!"}
{"text":"The law of averages forces me to give Comida three stars...
For ambiance and service, I give it 4 stars. For food and drinks however, 2 stars is more like it. While the description and appearance of all the food served here is really nice, everything I've tried (except for may be the octopus) lacks in flavor - even the dessert isn't sweet as a dessert is meant to be! Their portions are quite small, but prices aren't.. so if you're hungry and looking for a heavy or somewhat heavy meal, this may not be the place to pick. But, if you are looking for a cool spot to hang out, grab a drink and an app - then this might be a good place to start. I hear they have a patio and since we're getting in to the outdoor drinking time of the year, I may go back and give Comida yet another try."}
{"text":"Food, drinks and service were excellent.  I had the Flor Espanol to drink and Carne Asada as my main.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Best quality Mexican food in Charlotte hands down. We eat out a lot and I think we are very picky. The flavors and food quality are outstanding. Amazing margarita's with house made sour mix. I actually watched them dice the orange and lime to make it. Wonderful staff. Absolutely under appreciated. Come now before all of Charlotte figures it out. Chef and owner of Little Spoon!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it. 

I went to Comida right after it opened and really enjoyed it.  Because of my positive first experience, I was very surprised to see how bad the Yelp reviews were.  At least I was surprised... until I gave Comida another try this evening. 

So. Bad. 

First off.... Get your menus together.  They handed us a drink list that was missing the list of drinks. The same thing happened to the table next to us.  

Beverage: Passion flower something.  Passable, yet forgettable.   

First dish: Chewy chips with guac.  Now I like some spicy food. But massive chunks of habanero may be a bit much for most people.  

Second dish: Cactus salad.  Quite good.  Interesting mix of flavors.  

Third dish:  Octopus.  Ehhh.... Things were clearly going downhill at this point. All restaurants seem to feel the need to have octopus on the menu.  It's like the new pork belly.  If you can't do it right, don't do it!  Speaking of pork belly...

Fourth dish:  Cochinita Pibil.  How, HOW, is it possible to make pork belly suck.  Just ask the people at Comida.  They have mastered this art.  My arm got tired from trying to saw through this under cooked slab of fat. My jaw gave up and I did not eat the majority of the dish.  Just an FYI for Comida - You have to cook pork belly until it is broken down, otherwise you get the inedible crap that you just served me.  The sauce/seasoning was straight up bad too.  Just harsh and nasty.  And then there's the tortillas.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure tortillas from Harris Teeter that have been sitting on the shelf for a month are tastier.  

Does anyone like the attempt to bring tablets in the food service biz?  I don't. The waitress stood over me \"Your bill comes to (way too much given how bad it was), hands me the tablet wanting me to tip and sign right there and then.  Not even breakdown of the bill.  Unpleasant and unprofessional.  And she never even asked how everything was. 

The bad Yelp reviews now ring true.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Although I saw the mixed reviews, I still wanted to give Comida a chance-- after all, it's the newest \"gem\" in our neighborhood. Unfortunately, the reviews didn't lie. While the parking was a perk (especially for Plaza Midwood) and the atmosphere was nice, the food and prices were anything but great. For an app, we tried something that basically resembling burnt cheese and a small portion of avocado dip. For dinner, I had the duck dish and my fiancé had the pork belly. The duck was pretty overlooked and the pork belly was so chewy. Even the sauces didn't have the best flavor. Overall, we had a nice date night but definitely not worth $100."}
{"text":"Food was average. What gets me is that when you pay $5 for salsa and at least $10 for guac (the price is \"market\" for guac.. come on!), you should get however many chips you need to finish those dishes. PERIOD. we paid for the salsa and guac, maybe be a bit less stingy and give us chips on the house if we need a few extra!!! I was appalled to find that they charged $3 for extra chips AFTER paying $15 for salsa and guac. It's just crazy. I understand higher end mexican places don't give away salsa for free-- and that is 100% fine with me. I will pay for salsa and the chips that come with it. But paying for an extra handful of chips? No thanks. Will not be back.

Also-- the waiter seemed pissy when a few girlfriends and I (who were drinking cocktails, ordering apps, etc) only ordered one taco each. Super rude service. We came on a Wednesday night, so it's not like we were \"taking away\" from a very lucrative table of diners! sheesh"}
{"text":"Fun setting and great food. Fine Mexican food at a dinner and it works. 

The nachos are bomb!"}
{"text":"Went to Comida for a late night drink and appetizer one night last week with my boo. The place is so cool inside! Loved the atmosphere. We also had excellent service.

Ordered the famous slushie that's on the menu. The server warned us about the smokey flavor and let us try it before placing the order. I thought this was really nice of her and I'm glad she let me taste because it ended up not being what I expected. But that's okay... not everything is for everyone.

For our appetizer, we got the chips with their bean dip (it had a fancy name that I obviously can't remember right now... sorry Yelp, I know that is not helpful). Anyway, the chips and dip were fabulous. I love that the chips are a little softer and the dip was very flavorful. It was a little expensive, because of the drinks we ordered, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. I definitely want to go back and try more of the food menu items."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. I recently moved here from NYC and have been having trouble finding decent food and my boyfriend are I are so glad we stumbled upon this place - it would fit right in in NYC! This is not a \"typical\" Mexican restaurant - you won't find quesadillas or burritos on the menu but it's authentic with very unique and bold flavors. I was quite impessed. The wait staff was great, and even the kitchen manager was very friendly. My boyfriend and I split 3 small plates and a side and we were stuffed so they're not as small as they sound (definitely a great sharing menu). The fresh cold pressed Jalepeno margarita was delicious and my boyfriend got a smokey mezcal drink that he loved (I'm not into mezcal so I loved it less). The side of corn was definitely sharing size and the nachos were great too(endless puddle of queso in the bowl at the end and they give extra chips if you ask) we also got the carnitas (amazing) and the grilled octopus. We'll definitely be back before they close at the end of the year and relocate to Myers Park!"}
{"text":"Drinks were superb - I had the jalapeño margarita and husband had the regular margarita. They were definitely strong and fresh.

Chips and salsa were yummy. I liked the crunchy/soft texture and the salsa had a nice flavor

Carne asada taco was meh at best. Ridiculously small which would have been fine if it was amazing. But it wasn't. It was just food. 

Pork belly was just blah. For $20, I was expecting quality. I've had pork belly before. It should be tender. Watching my husband saw up pieces for us was just sad. And the sauce, explained as spicy, was tomato at best. Just so disappointing.

Will we go back? Yeah...maybe for drinks, chips, and salsa. That is all. And only if the patio was open.

To add - we had to make reservations because they were fully booked. We made them for 5:30 on a Friday since that's all they had. We were only one of 2 tables in there. When we walked by at 7, they were still half full. Not sure what's up with that."}
{"text":"I do believe that I have consumed thousands of tacos in my lifetime. From Taco Bell to \"high end\" taco places. From West coast to East coast. From Alaska to Florida. In that time as being a certified taco connoisseur, I have yet to eat at the place that has been recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as having the smallest taco in the world....until I found Comida.  Comida has created the micropenis of tacos. 

Pending award:  highest cost by square inch. Good luck Comida!

{"text":"We were so disappointed. We went for girl's night out - 6 of us. great atmosphere, lovely table on the patio, started with chips, guacamole and salsa. Delicious - love those chewy chips! Everything was down hill from there. The food was not good AT ALL. Everything was extremely salty - a few dishes to the point of being gross, as if the salt got spilled in there. We sent those back. (note to kitchen - you need to actually taste the food on occasion) All of the tacos were just boring - the steak taco was very bland, the chicken taco was very fatty. The shrimp taco was not bad but nothing exciting by any means. Making a delicious simple taco is not hard to do - good fresh ingredients, a little heat, a little freshness with lime or cilantro and it should be the bomb - especially with homemade tortillas. They have a lot of work to do! Business was very slow on a nice evening at 7pm in a fabulous neighborhood. That tells you everything you need to know."}
{"text":"Great unique cocktails. Happy they brought the tamarind margarita to the new location on Selwyn. Smaller simpler menu which was carefully explained to us by the chef who came to our table and described some of the less familiar dishes. Good restaurant for sharing different things. It was all tasty. Not your usual Tex-Mex fare. This is another world. Nice atmosphere too, not as noisy as the old plaza midwood spot. Nice service. It was a quiet weeknight when we went, will definitely return."}
{"text":"The best nachos in the world, super strong margaritas, and fabulous service. The mains I've tried have been missing something. The roasted veggies were way too salty (and I'm a big salter), and the pork belly was so-so. But I'd come here any day for the nachos and margs....and I love that it's all gluten free."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time. Definitely make reservations. The food was just ok. I've had much better tacos with better portions that were much lower in price. We got the guac, 6 tacos and two cocktails. Bill was $76...."}
{"text":"Tried to come here multiple times. They're closed on Monday's. Finally came here on a Saturday and they were closed because of a street festival. The \"owner\" (read: employee) said that they were open \"all the time\"... and that every restaurant in Charlotte is closed on Monday. This is categorically untrue. Or whenever there's a street festival. Never mind the fact that every other restaurant on the street was open during the festival. We had a great meal at Dish which is literally across the street. 

There are too many good taco places in Charlotte for these people to be as pretentious and self important as they are. By all accounts this place's food and atmosphere are lack luster. I doubt I will try again."}
