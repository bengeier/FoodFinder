{"text":"Great chinese bbq. It's a hidden gem that nobody really knows about. It's one of the better places I have been to. Large portions and fairly cheap. Definitely better than your typical Congee Queen chains."}
{"text":"I have ordered party trays for 100 people gathering and everyone loved the noodles & mixed BBQ platters! My favourites are the honey glazed BBQ pork and the crispy roast duck, definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese BBQ shop in town! The skin of the BBQ pork comes off crunchy and well seasoned. If you want an amazing Chinese BBQ experience, this is the place to start off on the right foot. I'll definitely come here again for some mouth watering BBQ pork."}
{"text":"Ho Ho and Kum Hong BBQ have in my opinion the best roast pork in the GTA. However, Pink Heong, these guys have the best Char Shiu, perfect char on the ends, medium fat, juicy meat that does not taste dry.  They are my favourite place to go to for Char Shiu and the BBQ duck was also very tasty, and the owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"Good Chinese barbecue joint with kind service. Food was authentic and portion was fair. Roasted pork is highly recommended. Note that it is cash only."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very small and quaint, but packs a big meal. Typical Chinese BBQ, with kind service and tasty food."}
{"text":"When I in a rush and want something quick and fast, I always turn to Chinese BBQ places.  Today is another day like this and I saw Pink Heong and I know what I am having for lunch. OK, lie... it is a FTR and I am on a budget today, so that's why I am here.  BBQ Pork and Roasted Duck with Rice/Soup ($5.50)  was quite good. The BBQ pork has a good mixture of fat and lean meat and has this sweet honey taste. The duck has this really crispy skin and the meat was moist.   Not the best, but is convenient and at least Pink Heong looks and feels clean."}
{"text":"Love the bbq duck as its pretty juicy and not dry.  Would come again during lunch which I had the roasted duck and roasted pork. Price is pretty reasonable too."}
{"text":"My go to place for lunch. The prices are low and the portions are huge. Love their BBQ duck"}
