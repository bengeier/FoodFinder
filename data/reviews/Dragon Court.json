{"text":"Ever heard the saying \"dont judge a book by the cover\"?

Dragon Court is located inside Asiancorner Mall. The parking lot is dilapidated and unreal. Right after make your entrance to the mall, there are piles of abandon shopping cart, fish pond which doesn't have any fishes nor water LoL (Why? i was inform that it is the property-owner's issues) I can see why a lot of people would completely get turn off by it' cover.

Despise the horrific atmosphere, I'm only after the \"Quality of foods\" in the place. there is plenty claiming Chinese-restaurant in Charlotte but how many of them providing real \"Authentic\" Chinese food? probably 1 or 2 out of 15. (sesame chicken, chicken lowmein... really? man get out of Here!!! these aren't real Chinese's food). There are two dim-sum restaurant in Charlotte, if you compare dishes by dishes between the 2 places yeah there are some competition. but as portion and prices, DragonCourt win on this one, hands down.  I took a real closer look at both of the DragonCourt's kitchen and dim-sum menus, I was surprisingly shock of how cheap it is. Of course you will have to know what to order.


I'm Chinese, A lot of my American friends misunderstanding this place of being slow/bad service. which it is understandable. In order to get a full Dim-sum experience, it has to be in the weekend from 11am-2:30pm where there are workers pushing the dim-sum cart around from table to table. All you have to do is sit, talk, ask questions and enjoy. If it is on busy day, you have to be a little aggressive or else you'll sitting there crying for \"No Foods\".  I know you're paying for your foods and all But this is Chinese Restaurant and you wont get to treat as the king.

 hmm 4/5 of being authentic Chinese foods."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Thru out all the times we've gone the past 3 years...the service was never top notch, but management was always friendly in which made up for it. We went back recently and the older lady who is usually head of management was not there that day. They have a younger fella heading up the management time to time now when she's out. He was extremely rude to speak with and acted like a jerk because of his authority. We asked him a question and he literally laughed in our face. The first time I met him not too long ago he was only hosting and bringing out food. Now that he's the substitute manager most likely due to family relations to the main manager --- seems his head is getting bigger than what he's skilled for. They've hired some younger folks as well to service (who all seem to be nervous and/or poorly trained --- of course it's management's fault). Thankfully the old central Dim Sum is back up with new ownership and we will gladly take our business elsewhere now. No matter how awesome food can be....bad service/management will ruin any appetite!"}
{"text":"We were the only client today after a table of 10 left. Jan 11, 2011 is still a state of emergence for North Carolina and it was so damp, cold and rainy. The ice was slippery that having hot delicious dim sum was what I needed the most to relieve the gloomy mood.. I am so impressed that they were opened. Good service. The food was made immediately and even my friend whose non Asian had a good experience. Thumbs up to their fish & egg plant."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant for over 15 years for weekend Dim Sum. We  visited yesterday and were extremely disappointed. A lot of  things tasted not very fresh, were definitely not hot( I know it is hard with the carts but  they were barely room temp.) and there were some  dishes that simply tasted\"off\". I also had an MSG headache with 10 min. of eating.
 We will not be back anytime soon. I wish there were more Dim Sum offerings in Charlotte :-("}
{"text":"The food was OK.  Missing lots of great dim sum dishes.  The environment was ghetto and not somewhere you want to go alone or in the evening.  Asian businesses need to clean up their environments if they want to attract more business; especially the Chinese and Vietnamese communities.  Where are the health, building, and safety inspectors?  I can't believe Charlotte municipality allow this place to stay open."}
{"text":"Dim sum was very good.  They make their own chow Finn which is excellent.  Their boneless duck feet is an excellent appetizer to try.  Service was very good, just overlook the appearance of the shopping mall.  Will definately go back."}
{"text":"I am very particluar about which Chinese restaurants to review, but I felt compelled to put some observations together for those of you who are traveling to Charlotte and by chance think you will find some authentic Chinese food.  My conference in Charlotte is through the week and I was torn between this restaurant and DIM SUM restaurant based on my fellow yelpers.  With decision made, I set out on a Monday early evening to Asian Corner.  It really made me \"sad\" to traverse the run down mall in order to get to the restaurant because I could see this establishment as some asian entrepeneur's dream to create somewhat of an Asian area of Charlotte that would concentrate the typical dim sum house, asian bakery, Cantonese bbq take out, and nail shops.  What I saw was an asian experiment gone south, so to speak: Every store struggling, in need of renovation, and desperate for business.

It is not difficult for me to overlook the surroundings if I can find a place that offers really authentic Cantonese cuisine.  So, I sit down to a completely empty resturant and order my Cantonese standards:  Hong Kong style won ton soup to start; sub gum Cantonese Chow Mein (pan fried noodles) as the entree; and since this place does offer dim sum an order of shark fin dumplings and fried shrimp balls.

Ok, here goes... I got the soup and the broth was smooth with the raw green onions, the problem was with the dumplings. Hong Kong style should be a balanced combination of ground pork and shrimp.  These dumplings had no shrimp and the pork really had a bad, leathery texture which concerned me, for one, I could not exactly pinpoint if it truly was pork I was chewing, and two... the ground pork part really had a bland taste with too pink of a color which was discovered after splitting the second dumpling in half.  The order contained 3 but I had to stop at this point.  The sub gum Cantonese Chow Mein was presented in a large quantity and the noodles were crispy on the very outer rim while the base contained bbq pork, beef, shrimp, chicken, squid, straw mushrooms, way too much carrot and entirely too much gail lan (Chinese broccolli) strips.  The beef, chicken, and bbq pork were fine it was the shrimp that really did not taste right.... too fishy and way too chewy.  Also, I literally had to remove the squid and put it aside as my teeth could not break down the meat.  I found the straw mushrooms had a weird flavor as well... something like having been in the can way too long and starting to turn. The sauce for the noodles was the ever-preset and way too watery \"brown\" sauce.  So with this dish, you need enough sauce to soften the crispy noodles while keeping the flavor consistent for all the ingredients, however, this version was swimming in it to the point that made everything soggy.  

So, I wanted to flatter myself and try two dim sum varieties even though it was dinner time.  The shark fin had the exact same problem as the won tons - no shrimp with the weird leathery pork pieces in the filling.  The fried shrimp balls were completely tasteless and did not have the crunchy outer coating I expect when splurging on these deep fried dim sum varieties.

I appreciate the attempts and search by my fellow yelpers who really know good, authentic Cantonese dim sum and cuisine.  Unfortunately, its not here and I can only imagine the worst of surprises that would await those who want to order classic stir fry dishes and the level of wok hei that would result.  Couple that with the \"sad\" surroundings, it is best to stay away.  I am chaning my food search for the rest of the week to southern bbq and southern meat and 3s, the cuisine I think this city is more known for and more fitting to the region."}
{"text":"The dim sum is okay here.  It's no SF or NY like the other guy says; but, there is really nowhere else to go in Charlotte.  But, do skip this one for dinner, it's not that good."}
{"text":"What in the....
The food was just OK. The selection was limited but had the dim sum staples. The har gow dough was a huge flop, way too doughy, and it was fishy. The Xiao Long Bao were over cooked, so much so there wasn't any soup inside. The service I thought was good. Everyone checked in on us as they walked past, and I didn't feel like any of the cart movers were too pushy. 
I could not get past the shady, dilapidated strip mall it was located in. Right outside the restaurant entrance is a large dirt area roped off that is filled with cigarettes butts. This is INSIDE the building. It reeked. I was genuinely worried about the safety of the building. 
Sadly, unless the building undergoes renovations, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find a place that serves something other than American Chinese food.  I have never been on the weekends for Dim Sum, so it is almost always empty, which is a shame.

Stick to the \"real\" Chinese food portion of the menu and you can't go wrong.  The pork belly melted in my mouth; I can't imagine how many steps and the time it takes to prepare something so perfect.  I also recommend the Chinese broccoli and the stuffed eggplant (from the Dim Sum menu).  

Now I just need to save room for the banh mi place next Dragon Court."}
{"text":"This is one of the two only dim sum restaurants in Charlotte. I came here having been warned about the potholes in the parking lot. There were plenty, and it only seemed things went downhill thereafter. The mall was not clean and half empty. Half the stores had closed down, and the mall in general was not well maintained; floor was dirty and not regularly cleaned, then you enter the restaurant- it's dark. It's a cultural thing but Chinese people don't like eating in the dark. Like my dad would always say, \"western people like to eat in the dark by a candle and they call it ambience, we Chinese people eat black beans and if you eat in the dark you can't tell if you're eating black beans or dead flies, so turn on the light!\" Bad first impression. 

There was a small crowd of people gathered around the cashier/reception area. We went over to see if we needed to register, and the guy behind the counter regarded me with a puzzled look. Five minutes after a waitress came over somewhere out from the dark and yelled, \"OK, who's waiting!\" more like a bark and a command, then all twenty people standing by the door, us included, rushed over to her. Is this a refugee camp?

My biggest pet peeve is if you open up a dim sum restaurant, you should employ people who speak Cantonese. There is a large Vietnamese clientele there, and I think some of the waiters speak Vietnamese, which is fine, but when you are selling dim sum, don't ask me in English whether I want fried turnip cake, because I have never ordered dim sum in English and don't have a bleeping clue what turnip cake is. Oh, it's ???. It's like going to an Italian restaurant and be asked if you wanted the noodle thingy with that sour red sauce on top. Oh, you mean spaghetti with marinara...

The food itself was decent. The wait was long in between dim sum carts because the place was big but it was quite understaffed. I was looking forward to a particular dim sum dish; the waiter kept saying they're making it in the kitchen and should be out any minute. Well, 30 minutes passed and still waiting. We just got fed up and left.

Needless to say, we will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is B.S. only went here because the other Dim Sum place closed down. Wait was not long, but once we got to our table, all customer service went down the drain. Sat there forever. Tea came with no cups. Utensils we're dirty. Only 2 trolley on the entire floor and there wasn't much on it. Had to asked for food every time a staff passed by, which they just brushed us off. Never coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Real good price(cheap and good)  I placed a birthday party for my friend, the food and the service was great!  Whatever you need, don't hesitate to ask, employees are courteous and nice.  Will come back for more years to come.
Side note - don't mind the bumpy parking at the front, afterall, we're all here for the FOOD!"}
{"text":"The food on the menu is decent.  Dim sum is ok. But the service is BAD !!!! Come on Dragon Court. You're the only show in town now and you still suck when it comes to service.  If you pick this up you're business will improve so much.  Hope you will read this review."}
{"text":"The dim sum is good.  I like the stuff eggplant, crispy pork, shrimp crepes, and some other dishes.

As for the dishes in the regular menu,  do NOT order the stir-fry chicken in black bean sauce.  The dish was probably the most blend and least tasting Chinese dish that I've eaten.  I kind of regret ordering it."}
{"text":"I have no idea why some reviews are awful. If you're not accustomed to the area, the location may surprise you, but the restaurant itself is clean and had pleasant ambiance. I was surprised by the selection of dim sum and the quality of the ordered food. The chive dumplings were excellent and were a total highlight of the trip. They're filled with chives and a bit of shrimp. Since this is really the only dim sum spot in Charlotte, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Friendly service, delicious dim sum, and reasonable prices.  This is definitely not American Chinese and that's exactly what I was looking for.  The surrounding area is not the prettiest to look at (torn up parking lot, trash, closed shops, etc.) but it's great once you get inside."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of people on a Monday afternoon and when we walked to the door it looked like the place was closed. We were the only customers in the whole place and there were two waiters working that day. The ordering process was hectic and the waiter seemed uninterested. Once the food came out some tasted like it wasn't cooked all the way. I had previously asked for chili oil when I placed my order and the waiter said that he would bring it out once the food comes out, but I never got it and we were halfway done with our food. I asked him again if I could have some chili oil and he was very rude about it. He finally brought it out to me when we were about to pack our food and leave. I use to come here a lot with my family ever since I was young and it seems like their food and their service has gone down."}
{"text":"This rating is just for the dim sum dining. 

The food here is decent and reasonably priced. They have a solid variety of dishes to pick from, although nothing blew me out of the water. However, this is the most legit dim sum you can get in Charlotte so if that's what you're craving, this is my recommended go to place. 

The restaurant is quite large and is located in the Asian Corner Mall. The location seems a little shady as most of the mall is closed down/abandoned and the parking lot is riddled with potholes."}
{"text":"Ate at Dragon Court last night for the first time and it was wonderful!  The food was authentic Chinese and delicious.  A highlight was the Chinese Broccoli in oyster sauce.  The vegetables were so young and crisp and perfectly cooked.  Everything we ordered was fantastic and I would highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure how I feel about this place anymore.

I come here with my family for the dim sum. Today's dim sum was really good. There was hardly a crowd since it's Memorial Day weekend. The wait staff was really courteous today and made sure to come around multiple times to check if we needed anything. 

Most of the food tasted good. Our sauteed vegetables were way too oily and the congee was too salty. However, we absolutely loved the custard buns and egg tarts. 

I'm giving 3 stars because of how inconsistent this place is. If they kept up the service and their food from today's experience, I would come back to this place more often."}
{"text":"I come here for Dim Sum on Sundays.  The food is good, but sometimes it can be hard to get the right stuff to come around and last week my friend had to ask several times to get an order of steamed pork dumplings.

I haven't been to Dim Sum on Central though so this is my only Dim Sum experience."}
{"text":"We started eating dim sum over on Central until my husband came across Dragon court a number of years ago. We really enjoy it but over the years it seems like their selection has gone down and service is a bit sloppy. Every time we go though I do go to the restaurant supply store on the other side of the strip mall ...you can spend hours in there exploring around."}
{"text":"Dragon court was the best they had a great variety of dim sum, lunch special and dinner options. The salt n peper squid was my favorite. Chicken feet was great too. Spare ribs very good as well. Everything came out fast and services was amazing.

Kind of sad there the shopping mall is empty they could really use a Hong Kong bakery in the mall and a new drive way to help bring in more people. From the outside the resturant looks closed but once you get there it's open just hard to find."}
{"text":"Don't plan on eating much if you come here. Took FOREVER to get service and the same two carts came around about ever 15 or 20 minutes! My family and I came hungry and left hungry! I will NEVER eat here again! 

The cart service sucks and is slow!"}
{"text":"Can be hit or miss depending on when you arrive. Foods typically pretty good and affordable."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this establishment several times.   At one point, it was reasonably good.   I came on a Sunday several weeks ago for Dim Sum.   Because I arrived after 2 pm, I had to settle for microwaved Dim Sum dishes.   The Vietnamese guy waiting on our table did not understand what condiments I was requesting.   The chili oil was terrible.   I came by this establishment Sunday and ordered Lo Mein with roasted pork, several egg rolls, and Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce.    The pork was tough, the egg rolls were inedible and stuffed with carrots, and the broccoli was terribly overcooked and tough.   The garlic sauce was not so good either.  After living in China, I know good Chinese food.    DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Low and behold. I am back reviewing at a Chinese restaurant in Charlotte in the \"dangerous\" area of asian corner. And do I have an update for everyone who said not to go here.

My family and I have heard that a good friend who used to cook at a place before yelp's time was back at it again in Charlotte. And we definitely had to come eat his food again. The restaurant has taken a new turn for the better with this chef. They also replaced furniture and made it look better.

If you want some authentic Chinese, and you don't mind trying new food then follow what I ordered and you won't go wrong. This chef has cooked world wide and from, yes you guessed it. Hong Kong. 

So this is what we ordered: duck feet, chinese broccoli with garlic, and fish. Three dishes, and all amazing. I can't comment on the price as I didn't pick up the tab. 

Overall since this chef is back, I will definitely be back to eat his food. (Note the date of this review as the chef will be leaving the country in a year...)"}
{"text":"This place is the bee's knees. As other reviews point out, the property this place is located in is mostly shut down and is ollld. The parking lot is the worst I've seen in Charlotte, and the walk through the mostly abandoned indoor mall on the way to the restaurant is sort of sad since there's a bunch of shuttered stores, a long-dry fountain, etc. My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place and have been back consistently almost every weekend since for the past few months. We've only been here for the dimsum, but it's always been on point. The staff is attentive and even if they don't have what you want on the cart they'll go back and get some or have more made. All of their dumplings, buns and shumai are delicious, and if you're looking for a bit more they've got pork with crispy fried skin, chicken feet, tripe and a bunch of other good stuff. 

Don't let the aesthetics of the building this place is in deter you - if you want dimsum in Charlotte, this is the best I've had."}
{"text":"The best spot for duck!!! I always stop by when I'm in the mood for some Hong Kong style roasted duck. It's so delicuous and authentic!!!! I mean the mall it is in is kind of sketchy but the food is always on point!!! So good!!! I definitely recommend it for the food."}
{"text":"I remember a long time ago when this place was the bomb -- or even the whole Asian Corner Mall that it's situated in.  Now, after watching poor maintenance of the area manifest itself after about 8 or so years, the restaurant seems to have done the same.  Food started going downhill for this place a few years back (I think the head cook changed), because some of the Dim Sum either looked different or didn't taste as good.  But usually I could tolerate it because the food simply went from extraordinary to average; I didn't mind driving 40 minutes to get here and eat with friends and family.  But the most recent time I went, the service was abysmal.  We had a large group that took up two tables, so it was understandable they would try and isolate us from the rest of the smaller groups.  But having sat in the corner of the room, my entire table was blocked off from the carts of food going around, and we were given no attention.  So my issue was not that it was particularly bad service, but just none at all.  Needless to say, we were so hungry that we left for the sandwich shop nearby.  I have confidence that there's no way the next time I go the service will be nearly as bad.  It was truly a disappointment."}
{"text":"Awesome foood soo good but the person who works at night is a doucherrr!!!!!!! Love their food very athuentic"}
{"text":"As a former employee, I have to say this place is the dirtiest place I ever worked at. When I was working there, there was an infestation problem, but the owner never bother to fix it. I would check their restaurant health scores before you decide to eat here."}
{"text":"For Charlotte this is a decent dim sum restaurant, of course places like Atlanta, Philadelphia and the west coast will have better place with a larger Asian population. But this is pretty decent. The location is hard to find and for many they will find the location a little sketchy. But I assure you the food is good and it's authentic Chinese, not the crappy \"American\" Chinese that we're all use to. Come on the weekends in the morning for the dim sum cart. If not they do take orders for them throughout the week."}
{"text":"Authentic but mediocre is the best way to put it. Everything seemed like it was frozen and heated up for us. 
I won't go back, and I don't recommend you go either."}
{"text":"So... you know those cartoons where there is a tent out in the desert and people are trudging through the sand dunes, finally arriving at a small tent... only to find out that inside there is a massive expanse of luxury and opulence?  That's a little bit like the experience you have when you come to Dragon Court.

I would NEEEEVER have tried this place on my own, had I not decided to take a Chinese cooking class through CPCC (really fun, you should check it out).  IAC, one of the classes was held in this strip mall, where we walked through the Asian grocery stores talking about ingredients, and culminating with lunch at this restaurant.

The parking lot is atrocious.  The entrance to the mall itself is set back under a pagoda-shaped sign.  Once you do enter it, everything is filthy, with leaves strewn about.  The floor is gritty, like a construction site.  It must be years since this place has been swept.  I trudged past dozens (it seemed, not sure how many) of empty storefronts, with the windows plastered in newspaper.  WAYYY back in the corner of the mall, past the empty pond and overturned shopping carts lies the entrance to Dragon Court.  It was DEFINITELY peer pressure that kept me from walking back out to my car, bc by this time I was askeered!  Once inside, however, the atmosphere was completely different.

The restaurant itself seemed fairly large, with many large round tables complete with the giant lazy susan-type things in the middle.  Chairs are cushioned and comfortable.  Everything seemed clean inside (whew!)  Our teacher ordered for us so that we could try many things.  I kept the menu so I'd know exactly what I liked the best.  We tasted:

Fried Sesame Seed Dumplings $2.65/3 
Pork Roll with Oyster Sauce $2.65/3 (loved these!)
Steamed Roast Pork Bun $2.65/2
Beef Ball 2.85/3 (nobody at either table liked these very much)
Stuffed eggplant 2.85/3 (my biggest surprise.  Loved them!  Stuffed with shrimp)
Shrimp dumpling 2.85/4
Taro strip on shrimp biscuit 2.85/3 (Yummy!  the taro strips were crispy, like shoestring potatoes)
Little Juicy Steamed Bun 3.40/4 

I think that the only things I wouldn't order again were the sesame seed dumplings and the beef ball.  Overall, I was quite impressed with the service for our group of at least 16, who ordered quite a lot of food.  In addition, the prices seemed quite reasonable.  I tend to be a \"taster\", forcing my poor husband to give me bites of whatever he has ordered, so the concept of Dim Sum really appeals to me, as well.

Should you survive the gauntlet of the parking lot and entry, I think that you will enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Yes I'm a fan of their steamed rice rolls in pork and beef. I'm happy that I can find such a place that similar to those Dim Sum place in NY, other than all those American Chinese I found in Charlotte. This is definitely my go to restaurant next time I have Dim Sum cravings. Of course it's not like those in big cities with large Chinese population like NYC, SF, LA, DC, the menu is limited, but the taste is decent (especially the steamed rice rolls!!!). Don't let the restaurant location and outside fool you, so far this is the best Dim Sum I can find in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Charlotte does not have decent Chinese restaurant or Dim Sum restaurant. 
Tried this restaurant and it is one of the worst experience. Every food we receive from the cart is either barely warm or cold. Servers are not trained nor posses knowledge of food they are serving. Woman who is either manager or owner of the restaurant hustling tables to sell a la carte noodle dish in annoying manner. Whole restaurant is empty and dark and we thought the restaurant was closed from entrance. 
It does not help to go into delapidated mall and most of the outlets are closed or deserted and give eerie feeling. Took forever to pay to the cashier who is not swift with calculator and totally lack customer skill."}
{"text":"11/13/10

Don't ever come here!!  

Should've known better than to stay and try the food,  after having to wait several minutes before being greeted by our server (the restaurant was empty except for seated employees about to have a meal); It took more than ten minutes before we were given glasses of water.  Service was very slow (the noodles arrived first, and that was half an hour or more after we arrived); our server was surly, almost to the point of rudeness; and my nephew and I even checked out the aquarium there-- it was almost void of live fish (maybe one swimming), w/ dead fish and excrement floating in the cloudy water.  NASTY!  But (and there's always a \"but\" in these kinds of reviews, isn't there?) we were starving... Next time, I will insist on going somewhere else, especially when there are many signs telling us to!  (Funnily enough, the restroom here wasn't that bad...  I'm thinking maybe not many people came to eat here, so the restrooms aren't used much?  LOL)

Total bill was just under $50, w/ minimal tip.  Food included about six dim sum plates, a beef stir-fry, lo mein noodles, tea, and water.  The only item all of us liked here (Mom, sister, my nephew, and me) were the noodles!  The beef stir-fry was the only thing I thought was palatable, w/ some of the meat tougher than the others.  (Don't even get me started on the dim sum fillings!) I'd never recommend this place for dim sum to anyone!  

I wouldn't be surprised to hear this place closing down very soon, if it isn't already. What a horrible experience.  :("}
{"text":"Drove home all the way from Winston-Salem and this was our spot for lunch. It's a nice big open space with lots of tables and chairs. The staffs are nice and friendly. We ordered a lot of delicious food from the chart and from the menu. My favorite is the chicken feet. We had little ones who loved the fried taro. I had the jasmine tea and they brought sugar rocks to add into it. Our favorite dim sum restaurant."}
{"text":"Sad sad sad.

As everyone in Charlotte surely knows by now, there are not a lot of dim sum options in the city.  That being said, the two Charlotte dim sum restaurants (Dragon Court, Dim Sum Restaurant) have a history of being  generally decent on average (at least through my narrow Asian eyes), and on their best days they could actually give the illusion that they might fit in as a middle-level dim sum place in Vancouver or LA.

So with the knowledge that Christmas day is a popular dim sum day for Chinese families in Charlotte, you would think Dragon Court would bring its A-game for dim sum lunch right?  Right?

Seriously, Dragon Court, WTF?

THE GOOD

Cheng Fun (rice paper rolls with BBQ pork or shrimp): Perhaps the only thing I thoroughly enjoyed.  The noodle rolls were appropriately soft and silky which is one of the hardest techniques to master, so clearly the badness of the rest of the food couldn't be contributed to lack of skill.  All the rolls had a decent ratio of meat in them as well.  Finally, the cheng fun came out nice and hot, which is more than can be said for several of the other dishes we ate.

Pork Spare Ribs: Done in my favorite style with black bean sauce  Solid amount in each portion, tender and flavorful meat, also came out hot.  That's really about the last good thing we ate.

THE BAD

Dim Sum Temperature: Everything other than the cheng fun and pork spare ribs came out room temperature.  There is ZERO excuse for this crap.  It wasn't like the restaurant was empty and food sat in the carts for a long time.  I'll give a little leeway if food doesn't come out as hot as when it was made, but room temperature is unacceptable.

Textures: The textures of several of the dishes were just all wrong.  What do I mean by this?  Carrot cake (taro, carrot, meat) is supposed to be soft and moist, but it came out way over-dried.  Ha gow (steamed shrimp dumplings) are supposed to have thin dumpling skins but these came out way too thick and chewy.  Baked pork buns should never be burnt on the bottom, which of course happened here.  They even managed to make me not enjoy my egg tart as much as it was clear these were store bought frozen instead of made in-house or bought at a bakery due to the lack of a flaky pastry shell.

Dead Time: As my father says, the number one killer of any dim sum experience is not getting food out in a continuous manner.  It just destroys the flow of the meal.  There was one point where we had finished eating what we ordered in the first go-around of carts in about 10 minutes and nothing else came out of kitchen for an additional 10 minutes after that.  20 minutes to make more dim sum?  Absolutely no pacing of bringing out food?  Come on, Dragon Court, I know you're better than that.

PURGATORY

Atmosphere: The ambience is always in purgatory for places like these.  If you don't mind a big screen TV turned up during all dining hours for the kids to watch, then you will have no problem with this place in terms of atmosphere.  Certainly don't expect traditional Western cuisine service.

OVERALL

This most recent Christmas experience was certainly one-star worthy.  I had never left a Christmas dim sum lunch in Charlotte less than fully satisfied until that meal.  The only reason Dragon Court gets one more star is because I KNOW it can do better than what we got.  I've had better in the very same restaurant.  Consider this review the first two strikes though."}
{"text":"Let's be straight here. Dragon Court is not for everyone. The mall where it resides is not for everyone. But if you brave either - or both of them - in order to visit? Them it is quite likely worth your while.

This is not the Panda Express, and it's not even PF Chang's. This is where you go to get the good stuff. The downside, of course, is that you might need an alignment after driving through the parking lot to get there.

On the upside, you will have a fairly authentic experience on your way, and go by several shops that you might think are closed (chances are perhaps 50-50, but give them a try, you never know).

Once inside, the staff is both friendly and attentive, which is helpful, because this is not someplace where you'll want to look at the menus, this is a place where you need to know what you want to order, or you need to know someone to help you.

The last time we were there, we happened to get lucky and have someone as our guide - it's like we were a part of the family and were given all sorts of things that it is unlikely we would have ever ordered on our own. And good thing we did, because it was awesome. If you can do so, I would highly suggest it.

They are also one of the only (perhaps the only) place remaining in Charlotte to do traditional dim sum, with carts and all, so check that out if you get the opportunity."}
{"text":"Dim Sum is not good at all.  This restaurant is better than Dim Sum on Central.  That is not really saying much.  The dishes seem frozen and not fresh.  The dim sum was bland and not much variety.  I do not expect Charlotte to have the quality dim sum of large cities.  However, I do expect the staple dim sums such as chicken feet, shrimp rice noodles and other to be at least good.  However, they are not.  Recommendations for dim sum is to drive to Atlanta."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for Cambodian weddings. It's pretty much the standard spot for our Cambodian community gatherings and the food is great during those special events. They serve 9-10 courses and each dish comes out piping hot and delicious. 

I'm giving 3 stars for my experience during Sunday dim sum brunch. I would've given 1 star except I'm considering they're capable of doing much better as I've experienced in those special events mentioned earlier. 

We had a table of 11 people and the place was packed! The servers all seemed very overwhelmed by the sheer volume of customers- kitchen must've felt the same emotions because everything was off. 
I saw people get up from their tables and grab their own water refills! 

Starting with the dim sum. Traditionally, the carts come around with little offerings and you pick whichever items suit your fancy and the servers check off the item on a piece of paper to track It. 
Outside of Sunday brunch, you order off the dim sum menu. I came here with friends for Sunday brunch and there were carts - but not much food. 
The same three carts went around the whole restaurant with the same 4-5 options. I made the mistake of selecting turnip cake and it was cold. I mean, ice cold. Not room temperature cold but like It just came out of the fridge. I wonder how long It sat on that cart before I picked It? 

I asked the waitress for a fresh portion but instead, they just microwaved the current portion. How do I know? Because the turnip cake came back with 3 pieces, one with a bite taken out of It that was my doing. Uh, thanks...? 

I asked every server that passed by about the standard dishes - chicken feet, tripe, spare ribs, stuffed eggplant and shrimp balls. Are they coming? Can I order them? Each reply is that the next cart would have It. But the next cart didn't. Again, the same 4-5 dishes that every other table in the whole restaurant has already declined. Just going in rotation. No new food. Why?

I ended up eating the reheated turnip cake, some pork and sautéed Chinese broccoli that my friends ordered off the menu 5 minutes before I got there. It was so disappointing and unsatisfying. 

Come on Dragon Court! You can do better. Being one of the only two dim sum spots in Charlotte- you have an obligation to the community to do better. We expect more. 

In the meantime, I'll just get my dim sum fix when I travel 4 hours to Atlanta. So sad."}
{"text":"Fun dim sum.  This is located in an old mall with several Asian stores inside.  The mall itself is kind of dirty and smells kind of bad.  It's not my favorite place to walk through honestly.  The restaurant is very dark inside.  There weren't many people inside during lunch one weekday.  The wait was a little long anyway for some reason.

I got the lo mein and wasn't really impressed.  The noodles were more thin than I like.  It was a little dry also.  I tried the custard and red bean bun from the dim sum menu and liked them a lot.  Some of the other dim sum looked promising as well."}
{"text":"If you order from the \"american\" menu, there's really no reason to come pothole dodging. But the \"authentic\" menu is worth the time. Not that its particularly vegetarian friendly, but the three things that are... are pretty awesome. And inexpensive (all $8 each). Not a lot of Dim Sum we can eat either, but that isn't too surprising. 

Salt and pepper bean curd: crispy crunchy flash-fried cubes of soft tofu goodness, topped with shredded dried chilis, deep fried shallots, sliced green onion. Spicy, clean, savory. Sitting atop a bed of crispy deep fried rice noodles. So much flavor for so few ingredients, very awesome.

Greens are about perfect, but it saddens me to have to pay as much for an order of choy sum as I'd pay for a \"main\". Ah well.

I made the mistake of ordering something from the afore mentioned ameri-menu (Ma Po tofu, what are you doing over there?) and was presented with a soupy pile of canned mushrooms, frozen peas and carrots, and tofu swimming in an uninspired black bean hoisin sauce. Meh.

So come to the court for the Dim Sum (if you're a meater) or the Salt and Pepper tofu and greens. If you want lo mein or general tso's whatever, might as well order it from the place 'round the corner."}
{"text":"First, a disclaimer: I grew up chasing the best dim sum in Atlanta with my comfort-food-starved-family, and I've tasted the dim sum delights of countless cities including Hong Kong. I understand that Charlotte, NC probably won't host the dim sum mecca we ABCs of the Carolinas are looking for.

That being said, I'd have to say that Dragon Court hits the spot when traveling to Asia isn't on your agenda.

Finding Dragon Court can be a little unsettling. As you're walking through the desolate shopping center courtyard, you'll see rows of abandoned shopping carts, an empty water garden, a stack or two of broken wooden pallets, and a coin operated merry-go-round. We almost didn't make it.

Upon entering Dragon Court, however, you'll find that it's ambiance is pretty similar to many dim sum restaurants. One thing that's a little weird is that as soon as you sit down, pretty much every available food cart will flock to you. I guess since I've never been on a particularly busy day, the servers seek out customers specifically rather than just circling the restaurant waiting for you to flag them down.

I've been to the other Dim Sum restaurant, and dish versus dish, I felt like Dragon Court wins out. My favorite dim sum staples are all pretty much there, too. My trusty dining partner said he'd be a little intimidated to go it alone without me, but that's the beauty of dim sum: there's so little commitment. Because it's just a series of tiny dishes, if you hate it, move on.

Ultimately, Dragon Court satisfies my need for the occasional dim sum to break the monotony of Sunday brunches of eggs benedict and sweet and savory crepes (ooo actually those sound tasty at the moment...)."}
{"text":"Small plates.  Chicken feet, jellyfish, steamed rice, sticky rice, noodles, dumplings, need I say more"}
{"text":"Charlotte needs to step up their Dim Sum game. Can we stop with all the Americanized Chinese takeout on every street corner and rally together and open up just ONE GREAT Dim Sum restaurant?! That's not too much to ask and is a very feasible task, I think. Now get on it, please!

I've tasted some of the best dim sum outside of China in cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, New York City, and of course Boston. If I sound like a snob, it's because I've been spoiled by the best and no one should settle for bad Dim Sum when they've eaten great Dim Sum.

Dragon Court is located inside a dilapidated strip mall at the intersection of E Sugar Creek Road and N Tryon Street. The restaurant, itself, is not much better than the facade it resides in. The restaurant is fairly big and can accommodate a large number of customers, but the decor is rather outdated and in desperate need of revitalization.

I've only experienced wonderful service from this restaurant. Staff is always polite and helpful. Their Dim Sum is a far cry better than Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant. While they don't offer all the Dim Sum items that are generally available in those larger cities, their selection is adequate and taste good enough to sate my craving for Dim Sum until my annual summer trip to Boston. Also, on weekends they serve their Dim Sum in those trolley carts that I adore so it lends a bit of authenticity to the Dim Sum experience. 

Chau Chow City, oh how I miss thee... I would begrudgingly hand over the nearly $8 in tolls and pay the $10-20 exorbitant parking fee just to taste one of your savory pork rice rolls right now.



Where's that damn box of tissues?"}
