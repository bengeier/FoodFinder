{"text":"It was a Friday October 15th at approx. 6pm-ish.  My lady and I had seen this place for quite some time and wanted to check it out.  We were hopefully of a new dining delight in the old Don Pablo's building.

We pulled up into the driveway and at first it seemed like there many cars, but soon we realized it was for the other near by places such as TGIFs, Steak'N\"Shake and the hotel.

Upon entering the building it was interesting to see the change from Don Pablos to this....it was \"neat\"...loooked very fancy and I expected high prices...however they were not.

Being a New Oleans restaraunt, I expected to see some Crawfish....sadly No Crawfish on the menu! and No Boudin either.

The host polietly asked me if I preferred a booth or table and my reply was booth.  Nearly seconds later, he asked again, did you say booth or table? My reply was booth please (they place was nearly empty, and this was not a problem to find a booth)  Upon approaching the far side of the restaraunt, he asked me a 3rd time, Would you like a booth or table? I laughed and said a booth and joked with my girlfriend he must be high.

Our server then came out, she was a bubbly girl who said she had been working there about 2 months.  She took our drink orders then came back and asked if we needed more time....I said yes and asked her for her suggestions and she suggested something (sorry I forget what it was) that didnt appeal to me as I kinda had my eye on the seafood paella.

I asked her how it was and she said didnt like that kind stuff and that the texture was gross.  

At this point I didn not expect anything delightful from the rather uniquely atmosphered restaraunt.  

We were directed to the dumpling soup and a salad to accompany the seafood paella which we were to share......

The waitress....a friendly, bubbly young lady was quite enthusiastic and entertaining to speak to about the restaraunt and the \"show\".  She explained that the show gets pretty busy on the weekends and the bands are pretty good.  Truth being told the Band that was playing some kind of jazz blend was not too bad, and put me in a good mood.

The soup came out and was tasty.  Bread Rolls and salad did nothing to impress me.  While I love King hawaiin rolls from my grocer, this was a cheap immatation at best and the salad was pretty much just white iceberg.  We ate it and said nothing....

Minutes later the Paella.

I took one bite of a scallop and it was Raw.  I asked my date to confirm and she did.  I was poking around for a piece of andoullie....didnt seem to find one.....didnt get a chance too look much further...DIDNT CARE TO LOOK FURTHER when the waitress came back and asked how it was I said I was not pleased and i didnt want it fixed, just wanted it removed from the bill and id pay for salad and soup.

She kindly obliged and we recieved the bill and left the magical place with not very good food :)

2 stars for ambiance, and good server

negatives
-food not very good quality *but hey cheap prices sorta*
-host forgetful of seating request"}
{"text":"The Showboat opened quietly in my neck of the woods, so I thought I'd try it.  I took the wife and kids to the Showboat on Friday night for some dinner and it was a weird experience.

When we walked in, it was quiet, too quiet, except for the Oldies music playing.  There were four patrons at the bar and the restaurant was empty.  Not one soul was in the restaurant area!

We were promptly seated and our server was very friendly.  She played with my son and made him laugh, so she got bonus points.

Based on the name of this place, I expected more Cajun dishes.  The only dishes remotely close to what I perceive Cajun to be were the Jumbalaya and catfish.  Remember the Oldies music?  Yeah, that's not Cajun either.  

The decor consisted of dark green walls and large Mardis Gras masks everywhere.  It seemed overly simple or gimicky.  Also, there was a large stage, which was also empty.  Apparently, they had hopes and dreams of enough patrons visiting one fine day to justify hiring a jazz band.  Things that make you go, \"Hmmm.\"

I ordered the perch with fries and a side of Jumbalaya (which wasn't on the menu), my wife ordered the catfish with fries, my daughter ordered a hamburger with fries, and my 18-month old son seemed like he was in the mood for Mac n Cheese.

We received bread rolls, which appeared to be store-bought, and soft butter, which was good.  The server brought the kids' food out first, which was nice of her, followed by our entrees a few minutes later.

My Perch was breaded and it tasted okay.  It was served with tartar sauce and cole slaw.  The fries were big and tasty, which I really liked.  The Jumbalaya was really tasty and my favorite dish of the evening.

My son ate all of his creamy Mac n Cheese and I tasted it too.  It was really good.  My daughter ate like two bites of her burger and a few fries.  She eats like a bird, anyway.  My wife ate most of her fish, but she didn't say anything about it, so I assume it was so-so.

Since none of us had any extremely positive things to say, I assume we'll not be visiting this restaurant again.  With tip, the bill came to $47.

Another weird thing that happened was, a few groups of people walked in the restaurant only to turn around and walk right back out once they saw the emptiness.

I didn't even know they were open and I work in this viscinity.  They should have given our HR department some coupons or some type of discount to drum-up business.

Overall, the food was very average.  It wasn't great or anything.  It reminded me of cheap diner food, except for the Jumbalaya.  My main reason for giving this place two stars is the fact that it's a full-on restaurant and being the only guests on a Friday night soon after opening is just creepy.  You can't blame the lack of patronage on the economy...somebody just does not know how to run a business.

I wonder how long this place will last.

Run away."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner there the on a Saturday around 6:30pm. We should have known when there were about 4 cars in the lot... 

The atmosphere was different. The huge Mardi Gras masks painted on the wall were kind of neat, but over all it seemed more like a theme room for a large banquet hall. We were seated by the fountain, which had almost no water in it, just enough to keep the pump from burning up. 
The music that was playing was Oldies, not bad, but not New Orleans. 

My husband ordered the seafood gumbo and was disappointed at the lack of seafood in it. I ordered the chicken gumbo because I'm really not a fan of seafood. As I tried the broth I told him it tasted like seafood, then I found the little shrimp that are found in cheap cans. I'm glad I wasn't allergic to seafood, because there was no notice that the chicken gumbo shares broth with the seafood one! The bread was store-bought-goodness, and served with a chunk of cold, hard butter. We didn't even think about asking for dessert. 
The waitress was nice, and took good care of us. Also the restrooms were clean and well stocked. These are my 2 positives to say about the place and the only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1. 

The food was not gross, but it was excruciatingly average, and not worth the price. We will not be going back, and I am telling my friends and family not to waste their money or time."}
