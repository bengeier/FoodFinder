{"text":"Bad service, the server was rude. We sat and waited over ten minutes without a server. And watch other tables seated after get served. I even said something to the hostess and still nothing. So we left, and on our way out they complained that were ridiculous for leaving and they did nothing wrong. I would avoid this place at all costs. That explains the service. The food not good either. The corned beef is fatty and flavorless. The steak is so thin it only has one side. The salad bar is warm the soup is cold. 

They made me choose a star. I would go negative if possible."}
{"text":"I love going here.  It is close to my house and everything is at price I can easily afford.  The variety is great for such a small family restaurant.  

My complaints are that sometimes the salad bar will have some pretty brown lettuce in it.  I know that lettuce goes brown quickly but one time in it was just disgusting.

Their hours are also horrible.  I believe the latest they stay open is 8pm.  They open early for the breakfast crowd, though.

Overall this is my wife and my favorite dine in restaurant.  I need to just say again that the prices there are fantastic.  I hope they last much longer than the five other businesses I know of to have been in the same location."}
{"text":"This is the place to go when you're wanting some comfort food.  It's a reasonably priced family restaurant that feels like you're having dinner at Grandmas. A very cozy and nice change of establishment to go and watch the Ohio State game without some loud, obnoxious drunk spilling beer on you as they get overly excited about a touchdown.

The soup and salad bar is always excellent. The menu is large, something for everyone, including great all day breakfast options. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan, which was not my Italian Nonna's, but still nice with rigatoni,  red sauce and a garlic bread stick. My hubby ordered the Thanksgiving style plate with a huge pile of white and dark meat turkey with gravy,  mashed potatoes and the typical mixed veggies. 

Dessert was rice pudding with a huge mound of whipped cream. It was was yummy,  too. Everything was tasty, the service was prompt and courteous. The refills were on point. I've been going there for years. Worth checking out. A great bang for your buck,  indeed."}
{"text":"It seems to be a good place to pop in for a quick bite and cheap breakfast and the staff is kind and speedy . Give em a try sometime"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. Note that it's a family place, so don't expect anything upscale. I ordered a burger, cooked to order with bacon and cheese. It was amazing. Definitely the best burger I've had in a long time. Perfectly cooked. My friend had a chicken bacon ranch wrap. Excellent prices too! For the two of us, the bill was $19. Nicole, our server, was fantastic. Very fast and she did fantastic. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Decent home style food, very affordable and delicious. The salad bar is spectacular and very filling, and the entrees are very tasty."}
{"text":"Very good food. The food came hot And delicious just as expected. The salad bar was clean and fresh. Not to many options but ... hey what a bargain. Did I mention soup is included !! I'll be back to this place next time I'm in the neighborhood ?"}
{"text":"The chicken noodle soup reminds me of my moms. I love their salad bar, and at 5.59$ plus soup you can't beat it. My favorite sandwich is the Texas BLT, it is a monstrous BLT with a beautiful amount of delicious bacon get that with the soup and salad bar and you will be stuffed and you get it for a steal. My boyfriend and I love coming for breakfast, their skillets are my favorite. As far as service goes, the waitresses are lovely and know us by face because we go in so often. I have only ever had bad service one time by a lady who must have been new or something. Worst thing she did was let our drinks stay empty. Of course every restaurant has its bad apple and not every dish is 100% delicious but this place surpasses The Big Box chains.I can't stand going to places like Bob Evans ,Red Lobster, Olive Garden and paying what they ask for terrible food and getting crappy ass service. This is a much better place. As far as their hours go, shouldn't be eating past 8 pm at night anyways :-)"}
{"text":"I came in to get a coffee.  I went to use the restroom and they were a mess.  I knew I did not want to eat anything here.

So, then I tried to just drink my coffee, but there were too many flies.  They had some sort of buffet, but you have to be nuts to try it.  

So in short, dirty dated restaurant with flies."}
