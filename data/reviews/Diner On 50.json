{"text":"Having recently relocated to the area from Chicago, I was on the hunt for some authentic and delicious Greek cuisine. I have a firm belief that the best places are usually the ones you least suspect. I actually found Diner on 50 from Yelp and decided to give it a try a few months back. Its very unsuspecting (seriously, I've passed it countless times without a thought) but man, do  they know how to make Greek food. My go to order is the platter they serve with Greek style chicken, Greek Salad, rice and I upgrade from potatoes or plain French fries to Greek fries (topped with feta and tzatziki - trust me on this one) with lots of sides of tzatziki. It is literally so delicious and satisfying to eat. And the staff couldn't have been any friendlier.  After having tried it the first time, I convinced my in laws that we needed to get take out from there. They were skeptical but went along with it. I placed the to go order right there (you can order over the phone of course) and Jimmy the Greek (that's what he told me to call him) went out of his way to make sure that I was taken care of while I waited for my order. He went as far as to make me a latte on the house to drink while I waited. If that's not customer service, I don't know what is. So, to get to the point, I brought the food home and everyone went wild for it, seriously, loved the food. This has now become one of our favorite places to order dinner from when we do order out on occasion. My father in law has gone as far to say that the Greek fries are actually too good and he cant order them too often because he cant resist eating them all and they're better than any poutine he's ever had (this man is a huge poutine fan), so take that for what its worth. Therefore, I'm really impressed with this unsuspecting gem of a diner. Its simple, classic, no fuss and delicious! Give this unsuspecting gem a try!"}
{"text":"Wow! Not in a good way! Ordered two meals for my partner and I after seeing this diner and wanted to give it a try. The menu was extensive but found the prices for dinner to be pretty pricey and the quality to be mediocre. I really was rooting for a new diner in the area but was sadly disappointed with this place. Overall, I wouldn't go back here again given the price and quality of food, and the super slow service. Mind you, it looks family run but I don't like my food cold and honestly expect faster service if you're calling yourself a quick service diner."}
{"text":"This isn't just an average diner by a gas station in the middle of nowhere. It's an EXEMPLARY diner by a gas station in the middle of nowhere! Breakfast was hearty, well priced and made with love. They made me a cappuccino with honey that was out of the world. I had to have two. There's lots of space for those who are willing to stop by this Greek gem."}
{"text":"Great spot! I had eggs/bacon/homefries and a Greek salad, and it was all great. Staff are friendly and seem genuine in their care for the experience."}
{"text":"Good food for my first visit. Had pork salvakie dinner. Sorry for spelling. Was fresh and good."}
{"text":"Stopped in randomly on my way to an offsite work event.

Ordered a coffee and home made peanut butter cookie to go.

Both the drink and the sweet were delicious, felt made with love!

Would stop by again for a bite if in the area."}
{"text":"Great Local diner. Quick service, friendly faces and good quality food. 
Will be returning. Clean place too!"}
{"text":"Had to revise my last review. As much as I enjoyed lunch here, the breakfast is an absolute disaster. Both times I've been for breakfast, the eggs have been over done and oily, the potatoes a pile of mush and the toast completely raw. I even asked to have it re-toasted and they asked me to pick it up and bring it back to them (rather than give me new bread), they proceeded to re-toast the bread and bring it back to me in foil wrapping and of course at this point it was entirely dry and I had to get back up to ask for more butter, by which point the bread was cold again lol. On top of all of this, their drip coffee is atrocious, not sure what the deal here is, but it actually has a very funky/weird taste to it. ANYWAY, even though I enjoyed the souvlaki, burger and fries here, I will probably never come back because breakfast was that big a waste of my time and money."}
{"text":"Great food
Great people
Great service
Great value

Lamb is fantastic 
Salads are great
Breakfast combos are fresh and fast

Fav thing is the steak on a bun. Delish 

Good eats. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Honestly food and service is excellent. I prefer this over Mr. Greek. Very clean and nice family runs it."}
{"text":"Really good home made food. Ive eaten here three times now and the food is consistently good. The service is really good too. They treat you like family. 

There is an outdoor seating area in the back if you want to bring the family and dine in as well too. 

The greek fries are a MUST here."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place, we love the food, coffee, hot chocolate and staff are very friendly.  We particularly like their toast, bacons, homemade fries/potatos and French toast.  A little hidden diner at a gas station which you wouldn't expect much, but it will surprise you.  It's family friendly and our go to breakfast and brunch place.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went back to D50 last night to try their burgers. The place was well lit and as a result had many bugs flying around inside. I asked if they used frozen patties or made on site, they proudly  assured me that everything they have is made on site. I went ahead and had the banquet burger combo with fries and a coke. Great deal for 8.99 .

About 5 mins after I had ordered, I saw a guy who ordered the onion rings, he was eating these plump hand rolled rings, I had to have 'em!... so I walked up to the cash and asked if it was not too late to order rings instead of the fries, they happily said no worries, we'll make them for you (there was a small up-charge, which I gladly paid). 

At this point, I realized how basic this place is. It's a do like home kinda place which is important to know if you're going to eat here...if you want something, you have to ask for it they way you want it and they will bend over backwards for you. 

So how was the food you ask...The burger was a 8oz patty, served in a Kaiser bun. The taste of patty was very good, well seasoned and the burger & bun were was well dressed including onions and a mayo based sauce. The onion rings were nicely rolled in a batter with plump onions inside, glad I asked for them.

Negatives, the bun which was too big for the beef patty and made it seem dry (due to too much bread). The rings were on the oily side and tasted a bit like fish and chips. Then again, we are eating burgers and rings at a gas station diner for 10 bucks!! The comparison would be a prepackaged meal at 7eleven that can be thrown into a microwave that has not been cleaned in months....Overall, for a gas station diner, this place is above par. I would not knock it, considering the price I paid and where I was standing, it was well worth it!! 

I'm going to adjust my rating to 4 stars to make it more realistic in terms of expectations, but to their defense, this is a family run diner, at a gas station, in the middle of nowhere.  If you expect regular restaurant diner type food and service, you won't find it here and not at these prices.  I'm basing my review of D50 to other gas stations that serve food, not to a Wimpy's type diner which stands alone and charges much more for the same food."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch spot. Everything is made to order and very fresh. One of the best Greek salads I have ever had. Large portions and breakfast for most of the day. Don't let the location fool you... this place is worth trying."}
