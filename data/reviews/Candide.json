{"text":"It's off the beaten path, but that adds to the charm of this restaurant. The food is thoughtfully prepared and lovingly presented. You can tell that everyone from the sommelier to the chef are passionate about good food and good wine, and they're looking to share that passion with every guest. Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Great experience. Extremely fresh ingredients, interesting flavour combinations and friendly, knowledgeable staff. The wine pairings all complimented the food perfectly and added to the overall experience of the meal. Relatively affordable compared to restaurants of comparable quality in Montreal."}
{"text":"In a way, this is a simple review to write. I've never checked whether or not there are Michelin starred  restaurants in Montreal, but it's irrelevant here. IF THERE ARE/WERE, Candide is ABSOLUTELY deserving of one star minimum! MINIMUM!! THE END!!"}
{"text":"While prepping to visit this lovely city I came across a NYTimes article about Candide and made a reservation on eve of 34th anniversary. It was a wonderful experience.

We sat near their open kitchen, enjoyed the chefs at work, had a glass of their beer and wine. Then the flavorful dishes unfolded, beautifully crafted, fresh, mostly veggies and herbs. All were described in detail.

If that is an experience you enjoy than make a reservation. If not, don't and leave the seat for those who may. \"Tasting menus\" are not for everyone but we enjoy them."}
{"text":"It was really hard to find, and the whole experience was underwhelming. The service was strange and borderline bad - the server sat us at a table where the lights were not working even though there were open tables that were properly lit, the server took my drink order and then forgot to take my friend's, and the server didn't ask how any of the food was during the entire meal. Speaking of the food, it was boring and just totally bland. The meat was overcooked, everything was under seasoned, and more of less every dish had an uninspired mushy quality. I would have given this place one star, but the wine selection was good and the interior was really lovely. Overall though - avoid."}
{"text":"A little hard to find on a rainy night, but that was part of the fun. I liked the decor; rustic, great tables that I expect were purpose built, lovely overhead lamps casting 'just right' light. 
A simple seasonal four course menu, on the two courses that offered a choice, we made sure we didn't duplicate. Sustainable and local were paramount. Service was outstanding: friendly, warm, knowledgable. Good bread was always at the ready. 
The dishes were very good and well though out.  All poutine heads ought to be introduced to the puree of smoked potatoes that coddled one of the mains. 
Special kudos to the sommelier. Her pairings were all a bit unusual and interesting."}
{"text":"Had a great two hours of fabulous food, wine parings and service. I was taken out of my comfort zone into a new world of awsome textures and tastes. I look forward to returning in the future."}
{"text":"Four of us came here for dinner last night and it was absolutely excellent. Great atmosphere and great food. I had read some reviews that complained the food was bland. None of us had anything that could be considered bland. All of the food had excellent flavor and a great blending of flavors. The wine pairings were interesting and just right. Well done. Service was attentive and excellent. 

Candide's philosophy is to use locally sourced food from Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces. This seems to be working well for them and I would like to return when they have more local produce. 

We were able to have a fun time and talk and the people around us seemed to be able to do the same. In other words, you could hear your table company ions speaking and you did not hear others. Great sound control. 

The only down side is that it's very hard to find. The restaurant is at the rear of a former church and there is no signage at the front of the church indicating where the restaurant is located. The taxi took us around the block a few times and then our friend phoned the restaurant and they gave us the information we needed to get there. 

The four of us left very happy with everything and sincerely hoping that this new restaurant (opened in January) makes a go of it ... In terms of food, service and atmosphere, it deserves to."}
{"text":"Unique approach to seasonal food. Locally foraged and grown, prepared fresh and served in a charming atmosphere. Wine pairing was terrific, unpretentious but extremely knowledgeable sommelier. Flavor combinations that are unexpected and delicious. Best preparation of lamb I've ever had. Recommend for a group of food lovers or for a date night. Loved the design inside as well, within an old church. Go!!!"}
{"text":"Candide is located on a small side pedestrian street, St. Martin, and is attached to an old rectory. It's location is beautiful but difficult to find. 

I've eaten here a few times. I love the ambiance and service. The dishes use local and seasonal ingredients. The prix fix is$48 with the option of a wine pairing $40 (highly recommend doing the pairing). The majority of the dishes are tasty but beware  the ingredients can sometimes be odd. I am an adventurous eater so I'm fine w it, but my husband has balked at the dishes on occasion. It's hard to give details on the dishes since (to be honest) the ingredients were varied and strange & I'm not sure what I ate last time I visited except that  it was a type of fish and it was good :) 

If you prefer ordinary fare, this place is not for you."}
{"text":"Great experience! We came here last minute on the suggestion of a friend/local who joined us in the afternoon, prompting some last minute reservation switching. Every dish was beautifully composed and included unique local ingredients. We were even able to try local wines on the suggestion of the sommelier. The atmosphere is unique - the basement of an old church. We ate inside so we were able to peek into the open kitchen as well. The service was fantastic and very friendly. They even gave us a list of staff favorites recommended other places to check out in Montreal and beyond. The one minor complaint is that they ran out of squash blossoms for our party (we saw them plating it for an earlier table) and it took quite a long time for some of our courses even though by the time we were dining it was pretty late so we were one of the last parties to leave. However since they had the reservation glitch, these were understandable. Really one of the best dining experiences I've had this year. While not cheap, it's pretty reasonably priced for the quality and number of courses, which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Candide, yet am still going to give it four stars driven more by my brain than my belly.

The fact I am first to review this several months after it opened kind of confirms who I think it will appeal to the most - not the demographic using Yelp with regularity, but rather intellectual food purists who have a high appreciation of what Candide and its head chef, John Winter Russell, are striving for on a philosophical level.  Indeed, critics in both Le Devoir and Le Journal de Montreal have already heaped effusive praise upon the spot, which is what drew my attention to it in the first place.

Set in the converted basement of a church, the space is aglow in dim, yellow light that accentuates the warm exposed wood. The restaurant serves what I would describe as \"elevated esoteric local,\" in that everything you will be served - with wine and coffee the lone exceptions - comes sourced from Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritime provinces.  So that means no olive oil, no lemons, and no pepper will be used in any capacity.  In contrast, you will find intriguing things like mushrooms foraged in the woods, leaves of grasses plucked from Atlantic coast beaches, and herbs found growing in the wild.  Russell works closely with foraging company Gaspesie Sauvage - if you're interested, go to their Web site and check out their photo gallery to see some the things that will likely end up on your plate in some capacity.

The menu changes every month or so, but is inspired by the season.  For a very reasonable $45 you will get a four-course prix-fixe dinner that includes two appetizers, a choice of two mains, and a choice of a sweet dessert or a cheese plate.  You can also match each course with individualized wine pairings for an additional $40/pp, but in my view you're just as well off buying a decent bottle (and they have a nice little list) for around the same amount and going from there.

But what of the food?  Well, that's the thing.  Throughout the four courses of dinner, I realized I was consistently tasting things or looking at the presentation and thinking, \"Now that's interesting!\" or \"I've never had this combination of flavors before!\" but never, \"wow, this is absolutely AMAZING!\"  My palate truly felt more like it was going through an academic exercise rather than simply delighting in what it was tasting. On the whole, the food was innovative as could be, yet still, undeniably, just a bit odd.

My recommendation: if you're willing to eat things that really can't be categorized, check out Candide's site and take a look at their menu to first validate that their limited options of the moment appeal to you (even if you don't recognize some of the ingredients).  Then, enter your dining experience with an open mind; even if you remain unconvinced by what you ate at meal's end, at the very least you will have been served by a passionate staff and chef dedicated to what I can appreciate is a more sustainable way of cooking and eating, and in a cozy and relatively unpretentious venue, to boot."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try it out with a group from out of town after a recent Gazette review called the food \"bleak\". I am so pleased we decided to check it out for ourselves!

This restaurant is tucked away on a little lane inside the basement of an old church. The menu is set at $45 for 4 courses with 2 options available for the main and dessert courses. Its ingredients are hyper-local and totally innovative. 

We ventured out in a -41 degree-feeling night and stepped into a venue with an energy and ambiance that warmed us up almost immediately. We were greeted by cheerful and helpful staff who waited on us with the utmost professionalism and consistency throughout the whole meal. They were so warm, so passionate, and so accommodating. When a few of our party weren't feeling adventurous enough to try venison hearts, they offered to bring out venison shoulder or a vegetarian alternative instead without missing a beat!  

The food was plated and brought to us in a spectacular fashion. The timing between each course was perfect and the plates were reasonably sized for a 4-course meal. The food was generally delicious (the venison shoulder was a ~tad~ on the chewy side but still perfectly seasoned) and clearly put together with so much thought and love. The wine list is privately imported and excellent, the cocktail I ordered was to die for.

This place is about so much more than food. It is an exercise in thought and a performance! 

Very highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food with fresh and carefullymchcisen ingredient carefully paired with wine. Excellent service wine. Warm artful ambience."}
{"text":"Candide is definitely worth a visit. They were able to get our party of two in right away at the chef's table (a converted church pew, like much of the rest of the restaurant furniture).

The food was local, fresh, with many items from their garden just outside. The staff was extremely attentive and walked us through the menu and our selected dishes. The kitchen staff were methodical in an almost Zen way - no rushing, cursing, everything was done to set (and maintain) a peaceful relaxing tone.

Great way to end a busy and stressful week, really enjoyed, will go again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The night before going to Montreal, I had this dream.  I imagined I was in some frou-frou restaurant with all sharp angles, low lights and distressed wood, being given a rundown of the current local pre-fixe menu in what my unconscious mind conceived of as a Quebecois accent (i.e. French with an occasional \"aboot\" mixed in).  The food was meticulously assembled and delicious in a new and unconventional way.

Little did I know that the next day all my dreams would come true.  Except the accent.  It's basically just French.

Candide is set in the basement of an old church, which immediately puts it in legendary status for hipsterism.  Add to that some unfinished wood patios, and simple, vaguely rustic decor and you have the perfect setting for what comes next.  And that is a 2.5 hour pre fixe meal where you watch the chef himself make each one of your dishes not a couple feet from your table and then bring each one to you, along with an explanation peppered with weird ingredients.

Each dish was a collection of interesting flavors from local ingredients.  Mussels with some kind of peppery crisp on top, curls of rutabaga with fried parsnip and probably the best piece of pork I've ever met.  My impression of French cuisine is that they do fairly simple preparations with an attention to detail bordering on obsessive.  That's the impression I got here.  I'm not usually one for flowery arrangements of vegetation on my dishes, but the design and the taste was really in sync here.

Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant in the griffintown area. The food was innovative and focused on Quebec produce. Even the delicious tea is locally sourced and made. Here's the only thing: don't bring picky eaters. It's a tasting menu so there is not a lot of option."}
{"text":"Hidden a few hundred yards off the main drag in a back basement of a church. Very charming location and the experience only got better after walking in. Perfectly sized set menu was interesting, amazing flavors/textures. Sommelier and wine pairing were well thought out, and a little different, but definitely good different. This is a unique dining experience but not at all strange, very warm, welcoming, delicious and above all done with love."}
{"text":"I completely agree with that first review from Liquid R.

The plates are apealing from an intelectual perspective albeit not very palatable. 
The Maillard reaction is omnipresent. Everything is slightly burth, slightly fumé and then deglazed in an Umami broth. From the grilled mushrooms, to the roasted oat and the deer brazed heart, every presentation is brownish in a brownish sauce and the four courses were surprisingly similar in taste, smell and looks. The meat, deer heart, was cooked to perfection, grilled but pink. But the texture was horrible, chewy like a sticky rice cake and completely in disharmony with the berries in the sauce and the acridity of the Kale sprouts. 

Too bad, I normally love those places off the street, with an undergroud feel as if you were priviledged just to have been informed it exists. But Candide pushes the monochromy of flavours, colours and gloom way too far for my taste. I wish them luck but will not go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful location, comfy setting, gorgeous wine and thoughtful food. The kind that makes you stop and savour every bite. The wines to match are totally on point - and the explanation from the Somm - Emily - is really impressive. The chef makes the food in front of the 'chefs table' so make sure you reserve to sit there. Lots of interaction with the chef and all staff which makes you feel at home. Great spot - totally recommend!"}
{"text":"charming ambiance, and enticing multi course pairings, underwhelmed w/the dishes (surprisingly)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed every bite. Very succinct but excellent menu. The chef brings you your food, and their sommeliere has excellent knowledge of her wine list. She suggested wines we would've never picked but that paired perfectly with our meal. I can't wait for the spring menu to come out."}
{"text":"Unexpected food combinations that are a wonderful experience for the palette. The wine pairings were a 10 on 10. Perfect and equally unexpected. The sommelier and chef are true experts and masters of their craft."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff. Highly recommend for a relaxing evening. Wine list is extensive and sommelier is knowledgeable. I love their focus on local ingredients."}
{"text":"Ate their at the end of January. Very charming spot. Service was excellent. Food is closest to the esthetic that you would find in San Francisco ( where I am from) than in anyplace I have been to in Montreal. Great room and location though hard to find. I will definitely go back and look forward to seeing the change in the seasons through the chefs eyes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly unique with a unique set of dishes. The menu is a four service. Tastes are out of the ordinary and  you will either love it or be uncertain. The wines that were on glass were not to my taste, but the service was excellent and the bread is to die for. Extremely original meal, with tastes that are rich and savory."}
{"text":"Although all the dishes were nicely plated, the food lacked soul. Food wasn't bad at all but I didn't have any \"oh that's really good!\" Moment.

The decor is quite nice as this restaurant is located in the basement of a church.

$45 set menu + $40 for wine pairing.
The wine was definitely better than the food served."}
{"text":"We enjoyed many delicious meals during our week in Montreal, but I dare say Candide was indeed the best. We were seated at the chef's counter and were overwhelmed by his attention to detail and his overall charm as he served us and described each dish in great detail. As we dined on the autumn menu, we awaited each course with excitement as we knew something special was on the horizon. Most beautiful of all was the setting. On a brisk autumn evening, the environment added a picturesque backdrop for a damn near perfect meal."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. The menu is adventurous and the service is great. The wine pairing really makes the meal- worth a splurge!"}
{"text":"Incredible!!! One of the best meals I've ever had!!! This place is a definite \"must go to\" in Montreal! The staff was so nice a welcoming!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here our first night in Montreal. And you can see the pride and love they have for Canadian cuisine and local produce. 

Yes, it's hard to find but they were kind enough to call us a few hours before our rezzie to let us know exactly where to go (behind the big church in what seems like a very residential neighborhood). 

The tasting menu was superb but what brought it over the top for us were the thoughtful wine pairings. Their young enthusiastic sommelier will go over each of her choices and why she chose it. For example, the sturgeon with the \"orange\" wine was genius. 

No, this is not a place for picky, everything-must-be-on-the-side eaters. You must be prepared to eat things like muscles with yogurt (delish by the way) or sea snails with pickles. If you are a true foodie, you will appreciate the truly innovative combinations. And the space is lovely, all industrial with an open kitchen. 

We're thrilled we came here and the cheese stuffed squash blossom is why I exist. Have it in place of the (delicious) dessert and it will change your mind about how to conclude a fine dinner."}
{"text":"The dinner was lovely, the service was good, and the ambiance was really nice. 

When we received our dessert from the set menu, my friend was really not a fan, so I asked the waitress if they would change it for her - their response was: No problem at all, don't worry. 

At the price point of the restaurant, we expected for them to exchange the dessert, especially when the response was \"No problem at all\". Instead they charged us $13. In my experience, they should have mentioned that they would have to charge extra, or make a note of it when we received our bill.

That (amongst other surprisingly high charges) made our dinner quite overpriced.

What they should have said was: 
\"Sorry we don't have espresso, but we can charge you $7 for a pour-over coffee\" or
\"you didn't like our dessert? Too bad, here's another one for $13\". 

Who pays $13 for a dessert? They could have at least warned us. Money doesn't grow on trees.

TLDR: They are sneaky, and will charge extra while putting on a smile."}
{"text":"We did plenty of eating on our trip here in Montreal, and we spend plenty of time in heralded restaurants in New York City. I have to say Candide is a truly unique and memorable experience that should be indulged in if your a local or visitor in Montreal.

Plenty of Montreal restaurants, and the cuisine in general, wants to celebrate its local ingredients and traditions in decadence.  Here, the team at Candide doubles down on the local ingredients with a hyper seasonal menu, and is able to amp up flavors with unique combinations while having a level of restraint, something rare in my short time in Montreal.

In just about every city, these restaurants focused on hyper-seasonal menus, vegetable-heavy dishes served in bone and neutral colored plates with an emphasis on organic natural wines are popping up. John-Winter Russell's was as good if not better than all of my previous experiences. 

If you can sit at the chef counter and do the wine pairing, do it. Great explanation's of the dishes from the chef, and the server or sommelier will discuss the wines paired with each dish in length. Amazing food, amazing wine, cool atmosphere in an old church, Candide is more than worth the splurge.

Oh and one more thing - if the cheese, sweet potato and buckwheat dish is available, get like 10 of them. All dishes were incredible but that's the dish I find myself craving daily."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely lovely time at this under-the-radar restaurant. My partner and I got the $45 four course set menu sans wine. Each dish was evidently well-prepared and executed, using ingredients sourced from the surrounding region. The pork main was, in particular, a highlight, being seasoned and cooked to perfection. Big props for doing proper tableside V60 pour-overs of locally roasted beans from Dispatch; it's always refreshing to see a restaurant defying the trend of nicer places resorting to crappy, industrial-sized pots of filter. Service was also impeccable. Hoping to see this place continue to thrive!"}
{"text":"Do not recommend. We tried everything on the menu as we were a group of 5. 

The fixed price includes 4 courses, 2 of which you can choose from 2 options. The entree Crab, yogurt and carrots and the Hen of the woods are the same for everyone. You then have the choice of Halibut OR Guinea hen for main, and the Cheese plate OR the Blackberry ice cream cake for dessert.

The hen of the woods was VERY salty. We spent a lot of debating whether the chef actually tastes the plates before sending them out because it was so salty that it was difficult to eat without the bread. 

Overall, the combination of flavors was very odd for 2 courses out of the 4 courses: Halibut, sea urchin and potatoes, and the Cheese, pickled dry eggplant and mashed white beet.

Halibut, sea urchin and potatoes was covered with an orange sauce that tasted very odd: it had this sour tasting undertone that is similar to expired seafoods/meats. Not to mention that the sauce completely overpowers the taste of the Halibut: no way of telling how fresh the fish was.

Cheese, pickled dry eggplant and mashed white beet was underwhelming: we had our share of dry and pickled eggplants so it's nothing new to us and the cheese (by itself) was actually pretty good, but the combination of flavor was not just working for us.

The guinea hen, the blackberry ice cream dessert, and the Crab entree was pretty good. 

The presentation of the mains can also use some improvement: the entire plate was covered by green leaves and juste don't look like appetitive.

We eat out fairly often and tried most of the hip and fine dinning places in Montreal. This is one of our least favorite ones."}
