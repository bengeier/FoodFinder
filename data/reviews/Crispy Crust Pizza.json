{"text":"One of the best pizza places in Calgary. Call ahead and they will have is hot and ready for you to pickup. Great discount when you pick up your pizza. The Greek is my favorite. Amazing crust and sauce keep me coming back. I always order the extra large so I can reheat the leftovers.

This is the one of the few things I must get when coming into town. Small place is the middle of a residential neighborhood, well worth seeking out. Great value for the quality of your pizza!"}
{"text":"I can't say there are a lot of good options for tasty pizza near me, just the regular chains. That is until I tried Crispy Crust. Even though a large is the same size as a medium in most places, and a bit more on the expensive side, the specialty veggie I had last night was AMAZING! It was crunchy and thick on the outside, with the cheese baked onto it. Soft but not doughy on the inside, and the sauce was well seasoned and not to sweet. It could have had a smattering more toppings, but overall delicious. The kind of pizza you would love to find in the fridge the next morning for leftovers."}
{"text":"We have ordered pizza from here a few times. The crust is not too thick leaving room for lots of fresh ingredients. The sauce is very tasty and they don't skimp on cheese. This is not a greasy pizza though, it is quite hearty and it will not disappoint you. One of our favorite pizza places in Calgary."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite pizza joint! I love the baked cheese on top and the sauce is perfect!"}
{"text":"OMG! The best pizza I have ever had!  I would drive to across the city for just a bite of this amazing pizza.  Tons of cheese, and the perfect sauce... too good!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place and extremely happy about it!!! The pizza is amazing, and the gelato has to be the best I have had! So glad to get a good local pizza joint on the west side!"}
{"text":"A fresh of  breath air from the normal hum drum pizza and food. More than reasonable prices. Love it !"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza.. Dry and crusty. Totally gross.  On the other hand the lazigna is not bad!"}
{"text":"Decided to eat here because of other Yelpers. I'm not a big pizza person, but the boyfriend is and it was his turn to pick the restaurant. I am so glad we ate here. The pizzas are amazing. They are Italian pizzas not American pizzas so you'll find they have no tomato sauce. Trust me you don't miss it. We had the margarita, Hawaiian, mushroom, and BLT. You get a discount for ordering four small pizzas. They were out in minutes and disappearing off our plates just as fast. 

They also serve pastas but we were too stuffed to try them. He said he makes his own sausage and mozzarella, and he was making dough while we ate. You can buy pizza crust cooked or frozen as well. 

We heated up our left overs in our Nuwave oven, so we didn't have an issue with the crust as another reviewer mentioned. 

We can't wait to go back!!! :)"}
{"text":"AmaZing food, fast and friendly service. They actually make all of their ingredients from scratch!!!! We're talking from, homemade cheese, bread, sausages.... And great prices too!'!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city,  hands down,  and the guy who owns the place is so friendly. Protip: if you order over the phone,  you get 20% off. I have never seen anyone actually sit in the restaurant, even though there are a few tables.  Mostly, people call to order food,  and then drive to pick it up 30 minutes later. Perfect pizza sauce,  and the crust is both fluffy,  and crispy on the outside!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place on our way to the grocery store and were blown away.  I am not sure what they are seasoning the dough with but the crust is what makes a great pizza and they nailed it. Prices were great, the owner was really friendly and we got our pizza fast and hot.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and have loved the pizza. I think it was called Hot Spot before. 
Anyway the pizza is always fresh, the sauce the way it should taste, real cheese that browns up nice and fresh vegetables. Real bacon, ham and pepperoni. The crust is crispy on the bottom and light and airy on the edge. Service from the owners is always friendly and fast. Only take out or delivery. 
So glad I live around the corner."}
{"text":"YUMMMMM. the pizza is awesome, but the garlic cheese bread and marinara sauce is an addiction. Soooo good."}
{"text":"My family loves this pizza. Always fresh sauce is delicious and perfect amount of crust. Lots of chains in the area but this is by far the best pizza. Support local and enjoy really yummy pizza."}
{"text":"I love Crispy Crust. It's obvious the sauce is home made and the crust is in fact crispy. Toppings are always generous and ingredients are crisp and fresh."}
{"text":"Crispy Crust is so delicious that we drive all the way from Aspen to get our fix. For my geographically challenged friends, that's thirty minutes, each way, of navigating through drivers who can't merge properly on Glenmore Trail. Pizza is serious business.

But you want to hear about the pizza and not my first world problems. 

Super crispy crust, as the name suggests. Not reminiscent of frozen McCain pizzas, as someone else suggested (...!?!) I mean, if you're comparing Crispy Crust to Pizza 73, with the latter getting the nod of approval, I can only assume you have no idea what you're talking about. Pizza 73 and Crispy Crust are not even playing the same sport, let alone in the same league. Well, you know, if pizza was a recreational activity. Which it's not. It's serious business. And Pizza 73 has no business here.

The pizza is excellent but the garlicky, cheesy breadsticks are a real gift from the heavens. I swear there's crack* in the accompanying marinara sauce. Sometimes you might find me in the middle of the night sneaking a breadstick as a vessel for the sauce. (Because why else would there be a light inside the fridge?) In the morning I'll have to feign ignorance: \"Oh no, honey, I have no idea what happened to all that sauce. It's probably those damn kids that we don't have yet.\" You know how people from New Joisey have literally come to blows because of \"sauce\"... I finally understand why. This shit is delicious. And totally worth blaming your unborn child over. Damn, little Anastasia, you have a lot to answer for!

Crispy Crust is not shy about the toppings either; these pies are LOADED and I love it. There's a nice heft to the pizza but they don't digest heavily. Also, they use fresh ingredients. Real bacon, fresh mushrooms, crack* sauce. Should be their motto. Louie, call me.

If Crispy Crust was any closer to my house, you'd probably see me star on the Biggest Loser or reprising The Wire's Bubbles. And I would have a gigantic marinara-eating grin on my face.

*Not actually crack cocaine. 90% sure."}
{"text":"I drive from Cranston for the pizza. I am a big fan of the crispy crust. Toppings are always FRESH. Never disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"People, this place is out of control...  Fresh ingredients, amazing crust and cheaper than McDonald's.  I had the bbq chicken and it was way better than CPK.  We had five pizzas and drinks for under $20."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Calgary by far. Try their thin crust. It's perfect. Not too thin. Great friendly service. Always a pleasure coming here. So glad it's near my house."}
{"text":"Believe the hype - this is the best damn pizza to be found in Calgary. It's all about the crust, thin but not limp. I know thin gets a bad rap, but you've got to try it. For real."}
{"text":"I have had a favorite pizza place for 12 years but after trying the #17 at Crispy Crust, we are parting ways. 
This is one of the best pizza I have ever had and I have has pizza all over North America.  A deep dish crust baked to perfection loaded with fresh toppings and just the right spicy factor in the sauce. Bravissimo. 
It even passes the difficult \"morning after\" test. :)"}
{"text":"Pizza here is phenomenal, great crust, generous fresh toppings. I'm down in Woodbine from the NW to house-sit and will need to make special trips from the NW for this pizza!"}
{"text":"Fairly average in my opinion. The pizza is similar to those late night 4 for 1 style of pizzas. The pepproni Is more on the side of a salami and the crust is not thinner or crispy at all. It reminds me of the frozen McCain pizzas texture of dougn....thick and dry...not so much crispy like there name says. For anyone who wants really good pizza stick to 73...definitely a way better quality of pizza and bamg for your buck."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and we love all the fresh ingredients. The pizza is good when you eat it fresh but if you like to eat your pizza cold then you'll be biting into hard dough. Their Nutella pizza is good. Take a menu and check out their menu and hours for specials."}
{"text":"Always have great pizza from here from the crust to the sauce and also how the cheese on top is golden brown. The owner is a very nice guy who is honest he cooked a medium for me instead of a large and let me have the medium and refunded my money Wow! I highly recommend getting pizza from this place and supporting the hardworking owner who runs in it I'm lucky it's super close but would. Drive across town to pick it up"}
{"text":"CLOSED DOWN..........    :(

Very eclectic. Very good.

Have been here twice and both times were very good. They do small, square pizzas. So, you get more variety for a similarly sized pizza from somewhere else. Many, many options. I have had a few that did not float my boat, but they were not bad, just not my liking. All of the ingredients were very fresh and the pizzas are cooked right in front of you as you wait, drooling. They have special days with magicians, balloon twisters and the like. Prices are not bad for what you get and they are definitely NOT chain pizzas."}
