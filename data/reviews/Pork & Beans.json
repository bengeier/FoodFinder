{"text":"What a great find for BBQ in Pittsburgh. Great atmosphere. Awesome staff. A great casual place with awesome food. I will be sure to come back. I recommend everyone get the dirty fries appetizer."}
{"text":"An amazing addition to the Downtown area. We couldn't wait to try it and weren't disappointed by anything. Not sure how large the people who complain about tight seating but we had plenty of room for the two of us and enjoyed talking to new friends.  We got the pulled pork and beef brisket. While both were good the brisket was absolutely amazing - fork tender with a great crust. Sauces were all tasty but honestly the meat was worth eating plain. We split the dirty potatoes as our side, and they were the perfect combination of spice and gooey cheese plus a ridiculous number of BBQ bites. The total bill with a couple beers each was less than $70 and well worth it. We had a half pound of each meat and the potatoes and couldn't finish it all. We'll be back soon to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"If you list a menu item as \"the world's greatest hot dog\" it had better be damn good.  Mine was just okay..and luke warm.  And the mac and cheese lacked any kind of sharpness or flavor.  So, $15 for the hot dog, mac & cheese, and an ice tea...high by a couple of bucks...and just not very good."}
{"text":"The place is all about quality brews, hand made cocktails using the finest ingredients with just about every liquor choice imaginable with a loud and social atmosphere. I sat at the bar, which is about half of the place, and had the \"Pork and Beans\". I is delivered on an oval plate with one giant slice of Texas toast. The server then makes a bit of a presentation while opening a sealed 16oz aluminum can of the home made Pork and Beans. The contents of this custom can of Pork and Beans is then strewn about on top of the Texas toast. It covers the plate in spectacular fashion and revealed an amazing soup of pork, 5 types of beans, spinach, multiple root vegetables (including parsnips) and a luscious sauce. I think they should figure out a way to sell this as a canned item to go. It's absolutely fabulous. They also make a \"moonshine\" which I did not try but is $9 for about 8oz. I think they should also sell this \"to go\" somehow. Great food, cool vibe and concept, and they hired he right people as they were all attentive (but in an awkward way), knowledgeable about the entire menu including the beer/bar, and were just groovy folks. Dig it."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was moderately busy. The price was OK, $9 for my meal. But I think the experience could have been better.  Food: Pork and beans with sauerkraut. Flavor was good, but not very spicy and heavy on the BBQ. - 3.5 stars  Service: Slow, they unapologetically forgot my order - 1 star."}
{"text":"Definitely give this restaurant a try if you love good food in a casual atmosphere.  They specialize in smoked meats, my personal favorite was the pork belly (and I didn't even know I liked that). The appetizers were tasty to start and I would say the dirty fries are a must!  The drinks are very creative and i found a new drink \"the dirty grove\" was delicious.  I would definitely go back.  Pork and Beans does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Brisket was damn good, especially this far north of the south. The collards were also quite good, as long as you ask for some pepper vinegar to go with. The burnt end beans were missing one thing, burnt ends. Couldn't find one piece of meat in there. Beers? They have more than you could ever ask for. Bartenders are super attentive, good looking and sweet. Cool ambience as well. Will be back."}
{"text":"We shared the ribs and they were very good.  The BBQ sauces that they offered were good too.  Didn't care for the potato salad - it had chucks of pork in it (like pork rind, I guess) and it was overkill.  If it wasn't for that ingredient, I think I would of liked the potato salad a lot more. The collared greens were good. They had a slight vinegar  taste to them.  Food came out really fast, w/in minutes of ordering, which I wasn't prepared for.  It's not a bad thing, I just wasn't prepared for it and therefore, did not get to sip my pre-diner cocktail as I would have preferred.  Very cool decor and good staff too."}
{"text":"Extremely average. Fries were WAY over salted, even for teenagers. Did a lot of research on beers based on menu on their website only to arrive and find that they do not keep their website menu current. Most draught beers were different. Grrr! How hard is it to upload a current menu? Cummon! Kale caesar salad had very little kale. Hot Brown and Double Down were misses. Brisket Sandwich and Slaw were decent. Service was lacking, had to hunt-down AWOL waitress on numerous occasions for water refill and the like. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Just a great place for meat lovers, my son and I really enjoyed our meal, service, and beer selections, it couldn't have been better.  The communal tables are reminiscent of a Munich beer hall and adds to the spirit of the place.  We both seemed to agree that our respective spouses would probably not want to go with us, but whatever.  The food was really good and the sides were perfect matches to the main meat dishes.  Service was perfect, as we were attending a concert later that evening, only minor complaint was beverage service was a little slow.  However, the place was crowded especially the bar as it was a Saturday night. A totally enjoyable evening,  great place to share a dinner with my son."}
{"text":"Our first time to Container Park,...loved the park but I won't return for the food specifically. I ordered the sliders and the mac and cheese. The clerk at the register was not the least bit friendly or even acknowledged anyone upon arrival. It took over TWENTY minutes to get my order with only one person ordering before me. Two customers after me got their orders before mine finally came out without even an apology for why it took so long.   As others have written, it was simply ok. Nothing to really say that was memorable. The sliders were a little too thick and flavorless. They had an onion marmalade that just made the buns soggy. The mac and cheese was a reasonable consistancy but wasn't exactly \"yummy\". I don't know. It was disappointing for the amount that I paid for it.   However, I will return to Container Park. What a cool little place! I can only hope the stores will sustain themselves as I saw most people just walking by and not going inside."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ. Tritip was outstanding. Excellent beer selection, sour beer option on draft. Great service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  We got the spare ribs and pulled pork.  The pulled pork has a VERY VERY salty, and had strong spices/curing salts on the surface portions.  The spare ribs also did not have great flavor due to over spicing/curing/rubs.  They come with pickled veggies - aka,  strips of onions (not really pickled), pickles, and a cabbage type veggie....also not impressive.  It was just bad barbeque.  We tried small red pea stew special (8 oz).  It had very distinct flavors that were not complimentary or comforting.  The 4 sauces are: classic, mustard-type, hot, and seasonal  (cranberry base).  None were anything special.  All but seasonal were very running and thin. Hot was not very hot.  The seasonal one was thicker and interesting flavor, but not interesting enough that I would take any home with me.  Layout: The front part is standing room,  bar, and some tables.  Then a chain link fence separating the main seating area. Main Seating is cafeteria style, tight.   The staff will  try to squish you in, even if the other half of the table is completely empty. We did have a reservation- early evening on Saturday.  We asked to be seated at the end of the table. After checking, they did accomadate us,   instead of squishing us in between 2 separate couples.    There are booths on the side, but you probably need a reservation in advance.  We did have a reservation and when we called, they said they were completely booked from 5:30 to 9pm. So we got an earlier reservation.  However when we got there it was almost empty, bar area was completely empty, main seating was less than half full.  5:15-6:15pm on Saturday night.  Restrooms were clean.  However, there is a large trough sink, that actually fits through hole in the wall connecting the men's and ladies rooms. You can see into the men's room and the ladies room from the other restroom ---- disturbing.  Also sounds and smells will be intermingling freely.  Disturbing again.   The faucets have a spicket handle like outside your house. They are not easy on your hands, and the water never really shuts off completely - wasting water.  Toilet paper is cheap quality.  There are only 2 stalls in ladies room -- so there will be lines,when busy.  The ceiling was a punched tin/metal and created a cool effect.  But it doesn't make up for the hole in the wall connection to men's room.  Staff - courteous and pleasant.   We are huge fans of Root 174 and were sad when it closed,  but we're eagerly anticipating the chef'snew creation.  We WERE HUGELY disappointed.    We actually stopped somewhere else to eat on the way home to feel full and get more water to dilute the saltiness.   We took over half our meals home as leftovers.....but they will be thrown out.  Disappointing :("}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Wife loved the Leona's ice cream sandwiches. I have been searching for a good BBQ restaurant in the area and this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"finally PGH has a real bbq place....smoked meats that don't need sauce and sold by the pound. the fakes (union pig & chicken) better take notice.   everything I had was very good - pork ribs, brisket and the tri tip. will be back, often."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is interesting, close quarters for sure. The food was just ok, best part was the corn fritters and dessert (not made in house)."}
{"text":"Although I made a reservation here because I was attending at event later the same evening I was seated at a table in the bar which was extremely noisy and uncomfortable (no back on the stool).  My husband and I literally had to shout at each other to converse. The service was slow and disjointed. The food was good but nothing special."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite downtown restaurant. The food, beer selection and cocktails are all great.   The dirty fries are my top choice on the menu. They are spicy, so if you aren't a fan of jalapeño heat then ask for them about reducing that for you. I love them just the way they are.   I've ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich. They are both done right.   The beer list is comprehensive, so you should find something you like.   On one visit, I sat at the bar and the bar tenders were knowledgeable and friendly. They know their stuff."}
{"text":"Overall, we had a really great experience at Pork and Beans! Our server was very kind, courteous, and quick. We were a party of four, and really over ordered. We chose 2 appetizers, 2 sides, and 4 meats, which was way too much food, but staff was quick to box it up for us!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some great BBQ in the Pittsburgh downtown area with a massive beer selection, great cocktails, amazing appetizers and even better service, please stop by Pork and Beans. I've visited some great BBQ places in the south and California and this place is one of the best. Tried the dirty fries, house made hot dog, brisket and pulled pork.  Each was fantastic. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere at a reasonable price. We had a group of 2 men and 2 women. We shared the pulled pork, 1/2 beer can chicken, brisket, corn fritters, Asian spare rib appetizer, broccoli salad, marinated cucumber salad and dirt cake dessert. The portion was perfect for our group, eating every last morsel and walked away comfortably full. My favorites were the spare rib appetizer and the two salads. Would highly recommend sharing. I don't think I would have liked it as much had I not been able to try multiple dishes. My only criticism was that the BBQ sauce was good, but not great and the wine list was limited."}
{"text":"So after much haraunging by my husband we were able to swing by the container park near Fremont street. It was after 9pm when all the under 18 crowd is kicked out so a peaceful uncrowded stroll through something akin to The Pearl District/Pioneer Square in Portland, OR. Piped in music and almost no crowd now, where to get some late night munchies after gambling for the last few hours at a local casino? Pork & Beans... ok I'm game name sounds cool, smelled delicious, and... well yeah.   I got the Classic which is Pork and Beans with a garnish of a random piece of over cooked bacon (ie burnt) and parsley. The beans were blah, really gritty texture and had to ask for some of the stone ground mustard to put on it to give it some sort of flavor. They were also not very hot temperature wise.   Now I want to make note that as someone who is a classically trained chef and whose mom was from the south I can appreciate a yummy rendition of southern food. This was not it, disappointed to say the least.  My husband got the Ultimate Hot Dog, it comes topped with the stone ground mustard, carmelized onions, and chopped pickle relish on a hoagie roll that was toasted on a flattop. He enjoyed his food thoroughly. (He is a chef too, just fyi)  We decided to try the rockyroad brownie as it looked tasty when served to some other patrons. Cold. Yes it was cold... and the parchment paper was still stuck to the bottom. Ugh, the flavor was awesome, chewy chocolatey goodness with toasted marshmellows and chunks of chocolate oh and lets not forget the crunchy walnuts mixed in too! Would have been way better warmed up with a dollop of whipped cream or the option of a scoop of vanilla icecream, just a thought. I guess if you are looking to serve people here in the dead heat of summer cold would be better, shrugs.  Service was prompt, probably because the place was almost empty, and and the people there were nice. All seemed appreciative we were there, even the security guard checking our ids as we went in.   Best part of the whole evening was the giant praying mantis out front whose antennae spit out 5 foot flames. If nothing else go check that out after dark!"}
{"text":"This is our second time at Pork and Beans. First time ordered separate sandwiches.  Second time ordered 2 separate sandwiches and 4 (we thought) platters.  We were served our food and asked who ordered what platters.  My brother ordered the pork belly pastrami along with my husband and I ordered the brisket, along with my nephew. We both claimed our platters.   Platters were presented with 3 slider buns on each platter and about 5 slices of meat.  At no time did the waitress explain this was being served \"family style\" and we were to share the platter.      When we asked where were the other two missing platters, she explained that the two platters presented were to serve 4, not two.  Thankfully, I could not eat the amount of brisket on the plate so there was some left.  However, the pastrami pork belly was a disaster of pure fat.  By the time my brother tried to cut a small portion of edible pork from the all of the meat, there was nothing left of the platter for the other person to eat.  And really 3 slider buns for two people?  So cut one in half so we each get 1.5 buns!  We voiced our displeasure to our waitress and asked to see the manager.  The manager as well as our waitress were very gracious and apologized for the miscommunication.  They did adjust our bill.  We were pleased they did not try to \"justify\" what happened and owned up. We all felt that the pork belly was inedible and the chef should have realized that  We felt that a restaurant of their caliber and reputation should have either taken it off the menu that evening or warned that it was extremely fatty.  My brother was aware he was not getting a lean cut of meat and it would have some fat. Honestly, this was 99% fat.  And the only reason my brother ordered the pork belly is due to the fact that my husband ordered it the first time around and it was wonderful.  On a positive note, the beer and cocktails were great and the brisket was as good the second time as it was the first time I ordered it.  Just be aware of the platter situation if several people at the table order the same thing."}
{"text":"The brisket was delicious. Best I've had so far. Fried ribs were fall off the bone good. Broccoli slaw was crunchy and very good. Beans were a bit watery for my taste. Still 5 star experience."}
{"text":"The wait was ridiculous 35 min for 3 hotdogs is absurd! The staff was rude to top it off. Not worth it"}
{"text":"Salty. Very very salty. The concept is awesome. And the food was good, just definitely extremely salty. Also, the bartender's were overworked to provide a quality service. It is not their fault, just way to overworked."}
{"text":"Are you serious? The worst BBQ I've ever had. I can't even call it BBQ. The pulled pork tasted like pork in a slow cooker that had brine solution dumped all over it. The ribs had the same roasted taste. They both tasted like they were juiced up with brine solution. There was no smoke flavor at all. It tasted like fast food at a cafeteria or McDonald's. Again, didn't taste like BBQ. The sauces were even worse. Not BBQ sauce but closer to a Chinese sweet and sour sauce. I have no idea what is going on at this place and the reviewers as well. How do you screw up BBQ? But the decor and the wall of beer cans, blah blah. You've been warned. I'm totally serious."}
{"text":"Went Mothers Day @ 4:00. They had a limited menu and was already out of ribs. Dirty fries were tasty and the frito pie was disappointing. The portions, both meat and sides were fine. Cocktails come in SMALL mason jars and we're a little weak. Only iced tea is sweetened, no other options. Brisket was moist, tender and flavorful. Only real complaints were the chicken arrived to the table FRIED!!!! No mention that it was fried or else my wife would not have ordered and nothing for kids. No milk and No kids menu. Kevin our server was cool and on top of things."}
{"text":"Trying not to be redundant but... -wait time for food was awful at 30 minutes exactly.. -pork and beans came out first (separate from the rest of the order) and were ice cold -the flavor on the sliders was almost non existent...really average at best. -the potatoes were ok..just ok..  Overall, my husband and I were disappointed to say the least"}
{"text":"The best pimento cheese ever!  The piggy ears were also delicious.  My family is a huge bone marrow fan, but didn't love the sweet BBQ sauce on it or the squishy potato buns with it.  The cocktails are fabulous!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, and the family style serving was nice for a family to share. You do get a decent size portion for the price. We weren't too fond of the seating setup. If you want a private table you'll want to be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place has so many good reviews. For bbq to even be good you need good sauces and all the bbq sauces offered were awful, the pulled pork was mostly fat and too salty to even enjoy, I think the mac and cheese only seemed good because everything else was mediocre. The decor is like a rustic pintrest dream board explosion, tried way too hard and I hate the bench style seating so close to everyone."}
{"text":"Pork and Beans is hands down the best bbq in Pittsburgh. For a little background, of the 5 of us that ate there on Saturday, 2 of us are official judges with Kansas City Bbg Society (KCBS) a group that sanctions bbq competion world wide. We have all eaten bbq from the best in the U.S. We ordered a vast sampling of the menu including the coffee dusted wings (incedible), jalapeno cornbread balls, (very nice) and then the meats. Since this is all served family style piled on a tray Texas style, we all decided to sample hard. The meats were tri-tip, pork ribs, brisket, beer can chicken with piri-piri sauce. Our sides were the collard greens, mac and cheese, bbq beans w/brisket. Our waitress was great. She explained what everything was, reviewed all the available sauces, and was knowledgeble about the whole operation. In the bbq world, brisket is the hardest meat to cook properly. P&B has nailed it. Juicy and flavorful while being extremely tender, without being over smoked. Just outstanding. Tri-tip is a rare treat as it is mostly served in the west. It too was beefy and tender, sliced thin and served med. rare. The chicken was a little spicy for some of our group, but was cooked perfect. The white meat was moist and tender, a big challenge for most cooks. The ribs were fall of the bone tender, but still had a nice texture and were not mushy or overcooked. Collard greens were perfect, tender, but still had a firmness to them, not too salty like some get, and had a nice flavor from the cooking liquid. Next, mac and cheese. They had a perfect ratio of pasta vs. cheese with a nice bit of a crunchy bread crumb topping. Exactly the way you wished mom would make it. Last, the bbq beans. Since beans are dish that seems to be one that people either like in general or never eat at all, these were very good. They had chunks of brisket mixed into a spicy sauce and a variety of different beans resulting in a nice flavor and varing textures of the mixed beans. We had more food than we could eat, which allowed for a nice bag of leftovers to take with us. I would like to comment on the pricing of the meats offered. Some people will be suprised at the cost of the meat which is sold by the half pound. You need to know that to cook bbq like this requires extremely long hours and you need to start with high quality meat. A brisket takes up to 16 hours to get to this level of tenderness. You also need to tend to it, not just throw in the smoker and walk away. The brisket served at Pork & Beans is as good as you will find in any place in the country. I've tried.  Overall, the experience at Pork & Beans was what I dreamed about for Pittsburgh. While every menu item won't be your favorite, the combination of appetizers, sides, and meats to choose from will leave you planning your next visit while still enjoying your current one. This, my friends, is the real deal. Eat up and \"Get fat-n-happy\"!"}
{"text":"Great new concept from Richard DeShantz and Co. Myself and three others went during opening week and the staff were spot on! The draft list is impressive and you can also order 40's complete with the brown paper bag. We tried the pork rinds and dirty fries. Both were good, however, the fries were a little underdone. We ordered the signature pork and beans entrée. The server brought the can of pork and beans out and opened it in front of us and poured it over the toast on the dish. The only complaint is that the temperature was a bit too room temperature for my liking. The choice of four saues were my absolute favorite part. The seasonal sauce is to die for! For desert, we shared a Leona's ice cream sandwich. Looking forward to trying more from Pork and Beans!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. After eating here I will forgive Keith Fuller even less for closing Root174. Positives: excellent service, good booze selection. Negatives: at best mediocre BBQ, communal seating, which I loath. Overall a hyped hipster place that disappointed. Will be some time before I'm back."}
{"text":"First time here.  Food was good. Served family style.picked a couple items and shared. Inside was different than expected. Long tables,sitting next to other guests. Great social place."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Waiter was rude . It was our first time there and waiter was condescending and ignorant to us."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I was able to get a last minute reservation, as I love tako and I knew Pork and Beans wouldn't disappoint. The atmosphere is great- there is a mix of booths, communal, and bar seating, and is very hipster chic. If you love beer, the menu was huge and fairly priced. They also had a few ciders on the menu, which was nice to see. We ordered the pig ears, pulled pork, and mac and cheese- all 3 were great, and the mac and cheese was the best I had in a long time (it has crumbled BBQ chips on top!).   For my food allergy friends out there, Pork and Beans was incredibly accommodating. My waiter made sure everything was safe and really went out of his way to make sure I could enjoy my whole dining experience, which is honestly rare to find these days. I can't wait to come back and try out more of the menu next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great Service, excellent food. The brisket and ribs were delicious!! Every course was great, second time and will be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Nice dining experience....as long as you don't mind sitting elbow to elbow with strangers. As it turns out, the diners around us were friendly and a lot of fun. Food was a little different but very tasty. We will return."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Best southern BBQ I have had in Pittsburgh. Drinks are tasty. Pimento cheese, dirty fries and Frito pie are all must haves. I would have def given this 5 stars if it wasn't for the service. Service was super slow. Our server seemingly only had our one communal table but would disappear for 10-20 min at a time. That's rough when you are left with a coffee can full of forks and one knife, and no paper towels."}
{"text":"I am sad to report that the waiter screwed us out of our change from our meal.  I guess he felt that he could just round off the change so that he didn't have to give us change back.  Didn't realize it until we got back to our hotel.   Food was good, tho."}
{"text":"My buddy and I were driving cross country and this place was top notch. Amazing brisket, rolls, and Mac n Cheese. Wow, just wow."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly laid back service. Went this past weekend for my girlfriends birthday. We had a party of 8 and everyone was very pleased with the food and drinks. I got the blue plate special with tri tip and brisket. The tri tip was amazing and the brisket was very good. Also had some sort of Moscow mule and that was very tasty as well."}
{"text":"This is exactly what you expect but still manages to exceed those expectations. We ordered a little bit of everything and there was not a bad bite in the entire meal! I crave this type of food and cannot wait to go back. A classy yet soulful take on 'barbecue' with just enough of the foodie twists to keep it unique! I had to be rolled out the door and am already planning a return meal to try the rest of the menu! Congrats!"}
{"text":"Update: after posting on here how the staff ruined my $9 beer by touching the rim of the glass and moving it to a dirty plate, no one from the restaurant contacted me to offer me a refund.  Nothing.  This place is an absolute joke.  I feel as though they forcefully stole from me when I visited, and that is not forgivable.  Especially when the restaurant does not care enough to reach out.  Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Food was dynamite! We had brisket, Turkey, fries, Mac and Cheese, Potato Salad, and broccoli salad.   We left full and happy."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. I,m from the south and these guys have figured it out. Best true southern comfort food in Pittsburgh. Another home run for this food group.  For those in the know the boiled peanuts are really good (Still not as good as the roadside stands in the Carolinas but good).  I will be back"}
{"text":"Downtown this morning for an event with bucketlist meetup. After we checked in we headed over to container park to grab a bite. The bartender(mixologist really) at boozery suggest the breakfast sandwich here. It's their only breakfast option but what an option! Soft bread egg, ham, crisp bacon, sautéed onions, mayonnaise with ooey-gooey cheese. It's really big I could have shared one. So yum a must try."}
{"text":"So wanted to love this place as I really enjoy Meat & Potatoes, but it fell short. My hope is that it was just an off night as I have heard such great things about this place.  We were there promptly for our reservation and were seated right away.  We ordered drinks and food when our server came over.  It took a half hour to get drinks.  This had me a little concerned because we had to be at the theater at a certain time.  Our appetizers didn't come until we had been seated for 45 minutes.  We ordered dirty fries and the coffee rubbed wings.  The wings were very tasty and has an unusual flavor.  The green curry side sauce went perfectly with the wings.  The dirty fries were tasty but very filling.  And I wish there had been more meat on the dirty fries.  Right after our appetizers came our server came by and told us they were out of ribs for one of our meals.  Before we adjusted our order I reminded him we only had 25 minutes before we absolutely had to be out the door and race to the theater and was that doable.  He says everything was ready in the back and should be coming right out. So we adjusted our orders for the ribs and had him bring us the bill so we were ready to go as soon as we ate.  Our food finally made it to the table with 10 minutes left before we had to be out the door.  Thankfully we are fast eaters.  We all had a version of the blue plate special since it allowed us to sample a few different things.  I had pulled pork, pastrami pork belly, Mac and cheese, and loaded potato salad.  The pulled pork was good but nothing spectacular.  I was expecting the pastrami pork belly to have the pastrami flavoring that I love but I didn't taste it.  I loved the Mac and cheese, it was super cheesy and had a great bread crumbs crust on top.  The loaded potato salad turned out not to be what I thought it would be either.  I assumed it would be similar to a loaded potato; so potato, cheese, bacon, sour cream.  I think it had all that but I took a big bite and it also had broccoli in it.  I am not a fan of broccoli so wasn't expecting or wanting it in my potato salad.  In defense of Pork & Beans there weren't descriptions under the meats and sides so I used my own assumptions when ordered pastrami pork belly and loaded potato salad.  Overall this meal was an unexpected disappointment.  Usually I love these restaurants and especially restaurants in the theater district know how to push food out, but this time it just didn't work out."}
{"text":"This is by far the best BBQ in Pittsburgh.  The only thing that I wasn't a fan of was the communal tables.  We had the brisket and it was the most tender flavorful brisket I have ever had.  We also had the pimento cheese to start and although tasty I felt the price was a little steep.  The ice cream sandwiches were a great ending, however I think they should have some in house made desserts that are more geared towards BBQ.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I want to be a bigger fan of this place than I am, and I've tried on numerous occasions. And I find the communal seating to be hit-or-miss, usually a miss (despite the pros of some friendly conversation, it's too cramped for me).  As far as the food goes, I've tried most of the BBQ options and none of them really stand out, and neither does their homemade BBQ sauces in my opinion. Everything's OK and I always leave full, but never fully happy. I'm going to chalk it up to my lack of enthusiasm for smoked meat in general, so to each their own."}
{"text":"This meal and service was great!  We had ribs and a pulled pork sandwich.  The serving sizes were reasonable.  My son's only comment was that he would have loved if the sandwich roll was warm.    I'll visit here again when I return to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"When our food arrived before our 4 beers, some 15 minutes after first taking our seat, we knew to readjust our expectations for Pork and Beans.  Our friendly but absent waitress offered no explanation for the slow drinks and thought we would be delighted with how quickly the food was presented.    Much has been said about the terrible seating arrangements so I'll skip that critique and focus more on the one thing that can save an otherwise poor restaurant: the food. We ordered 4 meats and 2 sides after being steered away from going the sandwich route by our server.    The broccoli slaw was excellent. The fries were strictly average.  The sandwich rolls they brought out with our family-style platter were still connected, obviously right out of a bag and not homemade. We were given 4.    And, BOY, what a sad little platter of meat.  When I saw how paltry my \"half pound\" of brisket was I assumed I was in for a real treat, some truly extraordinary smoked meat.  What I tasted barely passed for BBQ.   The meat breakdown:  Brisket: adequate tenderness but with a huge ribbon of fat. NO SMOKE flavor.   Pulled pork: heavily brined, NO SMOKE. Extremely over-cooked and had the consistency of meat paste. Nearly inedible.   Ribs: tasted exactly the same as the brisket. No unique flavor and again NO SMOKE.   Chicken wasn't bad at all. But nothing special.    Sauces: extremely poor, ranging from the too-vinegar-y \"hot\" to the absolutely terrible \"classic\" that tastes not unlike the stuff you get in the packet at Chil Fil A.  They need to source this stuff from people who know how to make sauces until they can figure it out.    The prices and portion sizes are criminal. $46 for 2 beers, slaw, and brisket!  If you have any exposure to good BBQ from places like Texas, Carolinas, Memphis, or my hometown of KC you are not going to be happy with your food.  Throw in bad service, bad seating, and a slow bar.  This place won't make it another year once word of mouth spreads."}
{"text":"Pork-n-Beans..  WOW!!  Arrived at 4...very comfortable back bar stools and ordered a drink - reservations for 4:30 came downtown a little early.  After reading up on all of my fellow yelper detailed reviews; I was well aware of the seating in at PnB.  I not a fan of the communal tables.  I prefer a more intimate experience when dining out.  There are several tables and some booths in the back, which I thought were great but found out after I inquired they only seat 3 - 4 people - not 2.  So decided to have the meal at the bar and it was a great experience.  I totally recommend it actually.  By 5:00 the restaurant was almost packed.     I want to give warm shout out to the bartender \"Mya\" who provided me with the best level of service possible.  Just selecting my beverage was tough yet fun.  There were so many IPA's to choose from.   I decided on \"Nugget Nectar | Tröegs Independent Brewing\" It was delicious.    Let's talk about the delicious food. The menu.. short and simple loved it.. The way the information is provided on the menu in makes ordering a breeze. I am a huge lover of \"Pastrami\" so went with the Pastrami Pork Belly:  It was delicious and so tender.  Sides \"Ranch Slaw\" - very tasty but slaw was no doubt drowning in the ranch. \"Fries\" simple potato wedges.  The fries were a perfect way to sample the 4 bbq sauces - which were all equally great.  It was tough to identify a favorite... *classic* fits the name - no doubt.  So flavorful and safe for those who don't care for anything too spicy or bold.  The *seasonal*sauce was top notch too and ideal for those how like it hot/spicy.    All of the smoked meats come with rolls, house pickles, onions and red cabbage on a tray with your sides.  Its really a fun meal.  The prices are above average but you get what you pay for folks and its worth it.  It was an unforgettable experience.   Thanks Pork n Beans."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I am a huge fan of BBQ and this really hit the spot. I didn't know what to order because I wanted one of everything. I went with the pulled pork sandwich and I made the right decision. My friend went with the ribs and they were also delicious. A must try in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This place is a GREAT addition to downtown Pittsburgh.  Build of the space was nicely done.  Service was a bit off / I believe they were understaffed.  Food was stellar - we ordered 5 different meats and all of them were great.  What I like about this place is you order proteins by weight / perfect for sharing.  While we did not drink any booze, they appeared to have a good selection of craft beers, wine, and specialty cocktails.   Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch I had here while sightseeing in Pittsburgh.  Brisket sandwich was one of the best I've ever had & the burnt ends beans were great. Fast friendly service to top it off, easy 5 star rating here."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  To start off the decor is so fun.  It's decorated in a rustic gas station sort of way.  The booths are fun they are sectioned off by rope.  If you have a reservation ask for a booth.  We had many appetizers and shared brisket, pork ribs, chicken and tri-tip.  All amazing and tender.  We also had a bunch of sides to share.  The macaroni and cheese is a must as well as the coleslaw and baked beans.  We had locally made ice cream sandwiches for dessert that were so yummy!"}
{"text":"I stopped by the week it opened just to make a reservation for the following week.  The woman who made my reservation was so nice she convinced me to stay and eat.  Marie was her name I think.   I had the hot brown and greens.   Both delicious.  The next week I came with friends.  We had cocktails that were amazing and the meat was heaven."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food at Pork and Beans. It seems much effort went in to creating this BBQ joint scene but without working through the food. Brisket  - at least Texas style BBQ brisket, which is what I've read Richard DeShantz was going for - is cooked low and slow and the fat melts basting the meat in juices to keep it moist. However, the Pork and Beans brisket was dry and my portion had a large fat marble going through it - obviously this has not been cooked properly.  My husband's order of pulled pork was equally too dry. The sides were not particularly good. Everything was just marginal in flavor and without the flavor being there - the price comes across as way out of line for the quality.   Food Order:  Dirty Fries - I guess this is their take on poutine, but the meat was from the ribs and it was just not good - the overall dish didn't gel in terms of flavors.  Brisket - 1/2 lb overall too dry and fat not rendered from meat. Pulled Pork - 1/2 lb too dry also but decent flavor.  Bread - quite boring rolls - why not partner with Mancini's and do some kind of jalapeño cheese bread to spice it up...a la Goode Co. BBQ in Houston, Tx. Or, better yet - Southern style savory jalapeño cornbread.  Loaded Potato Salad - average flavor profile. Could come out of any kitchen Burnt End Beans - basic flavor and not helped by the usually delicious burnt ends. Sauces - All were TOO SWEET!  Texas sauce is absolutely not sweet. Cranberry sauce?  Get the basics down before you get artistic and seasonal bbq sauce.   Prices:  EDIT TO ADD:  It has been brought to my attention that I am mistaken about the meat portions at Pork and Beans. You DO, in fact, get a 1/2 lb of meat for the prices listed below. Apologies to Pork and Beans folks for this unintentional error. This does bring their prices in line with other BBQ joints and I'm glad to have been given this correction. Thank you for setting me straight.  1/4 lb (actually 1/2 lb) Brisket for $14???  In Houston I get 1/2 lb DELICIOUS brisket for $12  1/4 lb (actually 1/2 lb) Pulled Pork for $10? In Houston I get 1/2 lb spicy pork for $10 Sides now $8 (instead of 5 or 10) with no size listed other than \"small\" or \"large\".  Houston sides - any: (Jalapeño Pinto Beans, Potato Salad, Cole Slaw, Jambalaya Texana, Austin Baked Beans or Goode's Western Style Green Beans) for Pint $7 or 1/2 Pint $5  Come on, Richard DeShantz, get Pork and Beans sorted - way too pricey for the amount of meat you get and the flavor of the food. BBQ ain't supposed to break the bank. I know you can do better than this.  Additional note about Pork & Beans:  The service was very good at Pork and Beans and it is a very neat concept, with a cool vibe and atmosphere. I think once they hit their stride with the food, this joint will be a fantastic place to eat."}
{"text":"Wow. Just - wow. This was some pretty amazing food. We had deviled eggs, brisket, pulled pork, cucumber salad and jojo fries. Everything was fantastic. The meat had such a great smoke flavor, that no sauce was necessary. It was tender enough that you hardly needed a knife. Service was great - our waitress was friendly, prompt and made great recommendations. I usually don't like sitting at a shared, long table. But it works here. Seriously - check this place out ASAP. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Maybe it was because I had lowered expectations due to the somewhat lukewarm reception to Pork and Beans here on Yelp, but the food and experience here pretty much blew away what I was expecting going in.  Like the other restaurants ran by Deshantz, Pork and Beans has an eclectic and fun atmosphere inside.  Wooden booths, long communal tables, silverware placed in coffee cans, food is served on cafeteria trays, it's definitely a hip place.   I wanted to start off by saying that my father and I had reservations beforehand regarding the portion sizes, as we weren't sure how much a 1/2 pound (which is how the meats are sold) really was.  We ended up ordering 4 different meats, including the spare ribs, brisket, tri-tip, and pulled pork, along with just one side of the wedged potatoes as well as the catfish sliders.  We ordered way too much, as the food was much more filling than it looked, and we actually took a good amount to go because we couldn't finish it all.  This was probably the first time I've taken food home with me in years.  Everything was delicious, but the spare ribs were easily our favorite.  Even something as simple as the potato wedges were awesome.  They weren't greasy, and had a nice, crispy and crunchy texture on the outside with a soft potato bite on the inside.  The sauces on the table were alright, but nothing special in my opinion.  After trying a little bit of each on the pulled pork, I actually found myself preferring to eat the food as is without the extra condiments.    This is easily the best food I've had of this kind, but I do have to note that I haven't had much experience before when it comes to these new age BBQ joints.  I'm sure that places like Frankin's and Pappy's Smokehouse are next level grub, but Pork and Beans made me a believer in this type of food and I for sure will be visiting again in the near future."}
{"text":"The food was some of the best BBQ we've had. The pulled pork was very tender and flavorful, without that overpowering smoky taste. The brisket was excellent as well. It could've been slightly warmer, but so good otherwise. The dirty fries were not my favorite. A little greasy, and the potato tasted almost like it had been frozen. Very odd. The collard greens were the best I've had a a BBQ joint. Just like my southern mama makes. Baked beans were good as well. I like that they serve dinner rolls with the order too. It lets you stack everything nice and high for a great sandwich. The seating is odd. There are communal tables and no hooks for coats or purses. We were there early, so we didn't have to share a little able though. Also, there are only stools, so not even a chair back to hang on. Then, let's talk about the community sink in the bathroom. Half of the sink is in the ladies room, and half in the men's room. I thought it was a mirror at first, and had to look twice. It's a little uncomfortable, as it's very open. Overall, I recommend the place though. The food is top notch."}
{"text":"We were excited to try out this new Downtown restaurant and went for dinner on Valentine's Day. I made reservations through Yelp well in advance but we had no issues getting them.  Not ideal for a super romantic dinner as the seating is mostly shared community tables but it wasn't busy so we had the table to ourselves for most of our meal.  They have a great draft list and many can options as well.  I went with a sour beer by Long Trail which they let me try beforehand and it was very tasty.  The menu has meats that you can order which come with pickled veggies, 2 mini potato rolls and slaw or you can get a sandwich which has a little less meat on it. The sandwiches do not come with sides and you will need to order a size which are all $7.  Kinda pricey for my taste but for a special occasion it was fine. I went with the 1/2 pound of pulled pork which came with all of the items above. This was cheaper than the sandwich and a decent amount of food. I also got the broccoli salad as my side which was ok as it had huge chucks of the broccoli stems it is. My fiancé ordered for his meal the turkey Devonshire sandwich which was topped with a ton of cheese, bacon and turkey on bread. He went with the mac and cheese as his side which was delicious but a little too much cheese for his meal.  Our waitress was great and love how they send out your recent in a Campbell's soup pork and beans can.  It is a cute place and we will probably be back."}
{"text":"Five stars for a multitude of reasons.  1. They were open on Easter Sunday 2. They took reservations over yelp 3. They were not busy and the service was attentive and speedy 4. It was a kid friendly place with a cool shipwreck bar vibe.   5. Cool clean bathrooms 6. The appetizers we had ( Frito Pie and dirty fries) were great. They included a healthy serving of brisket chunks with each one.   7. We ordered 1/2 lb of pulled pork and 1/2 lb of brisket.   It was cooked very well.  The char on the brisket was exceptional. Served family style which was bonus.  8. The cucumber onion side salad was heavy with vintages.  I liked. My wife not so much.  9.   Good value in the city.  You can get out of there at 30$ a person or less."}
{"text":"Stopped in for just a drink and it happened to be happy hour! $2 yuengling or Miller lite drafts and $5 craft drafts. It was around 4 or 5 on a Tuesday.  The restaurant wasn't busy at all, so if you wanted a quick dinner that would be the time to go.   The bartender was awesome, she helped us try to figure out the Untapped app and was very friendly. I definitely would come back for drinks and I really need to return to try out the food!   I'll have to review it post dinner!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, get the  burnt ends beans and the Cuban. You will thank me later."}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying I don't enjoy smoked foods, but I appreciate the art of them & all the accompanying sides. That said, I would definitely come here again. They do smoked meats very well. And they do all their accompanying sides from scratch and very well. For example, the burnt ends baked beans are from scratch with FRESH beans!!!  You can tell because the beans aren't overly mushy! The macaroni & cheese was outstanding & Homemade. The macaroni wasn't mushy!!! It cooked al dente & had fresh toasted breadcrumbs & fresh green onion topping it! The choice of BBQ sauces is varied with something to accommodate everyone's palate. You cannot go wrong here. Just go early or be prepared to wait. It's worth it. This is how 'Que is done!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Hands down the best restaurant experience I've had in Pittsburgh. We made a reservation for Saturday at 8P. We arrived a few minutes early and had to wait, which was fine - we soaked in the exceptionally detailed decode and were loving the back yard BBQ vibe; they definitely nailed it. Even going so far as to purchase the iconic Pittsburgh \"DRUGS\" sign and placing it at the front of the house.  Once showed to our table, I ordered the Repo Man cocktail and my friend ordered the Chandon Blush wine. I loved the repo man cocktail, tequila & grapefruit are absolutely two of my favorites. And my friend loved the tiny bottle of Chandon she had.   For appetizers we ordered the Deviled Eggs of the Day (chorizo) and the jalapeño corn fitters w/honey butter. Oh man, both were so delicious! And we noticed they gave great sizes for both.   We had a hard time deciding on dinner so really leaned on our waiter to help us out and he was spot on with his suggestions! I love when I ask a waiter their favorites when they actually narrow it down. Our waiter gave us suggestions based on just the two of us present and we ordered exactly what he said: jerky baby back ribs, brisket, Mac & cheese, & the kale salad (and we also got the beans because \"pork & beans\". Everything was absolutely delicious, the ribs and the kale salad were my favorite but the Mac & cheese was creamy goodness (idk what other people reviewing are complaining about, I didn't order a sharp cheddar quesadilla, I ordered creamy Mac and that's exactly what I got). During the meal we also ordered the one of the red wines, it was the second one listed on the menu, that was pretty good (rated a 3.7 on Vivino but I would go so far as deeming it a 3.9).   For dessert, we split the peanut butter/chocolate Leona ice cream sandwich was amazing - it was a perfect balance of chocolate & peanut butter but was shockingly light. Considering we were both whispering about needing to unbutton our pants at this point, we powered through.  Important to note that we had a great server - their runner was struggling a bit and brought us our left overs in a ripped bag that was soaked on the bottom. We let our server know and he brought us another bag, my friend noticed it was also ripped and just as she discretely showed me the rip, he came back laughing as he had intentionally done it as an April Fools joke - it was great and well timed.   Hands down, this has been my favorite dining experience in Pittsburgh and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Pork and Beans twice. The first time we had reserved a table. In the dining room the service was fantastic, drinks were great, but the food was extremely expensive and less than mediocre. I ordered bone marrow, brisket, and mac and cheese ($35+ all in). Everything came at once, served on a metal tray. The bone marrow came slathered with BBQ sauce, but nothing to spread the marrow on--I guess I was expected to eat it with a spoon? The mac and cheese was basically soup. I actually took this stuff home and it never solidified. Definitely made me wonder what was in the \"cheese\" soup the macaroni was in. The brisket was good, but there was practically none of it on my plate. Overall, though, if it wasn't for the food this would not have been a terrible experience, though.   So I went a second time just for drinks with friends before heading over to Butcher & Rye. I found out that service in the bar area was nonexistent. Once we were able to get a bartender's attention and get some drinks, though, the drinks, as before, were fantastic.  Overall, I think this is a great happy hour or drink spot, but skip the food because it's definitely not worth the asking price."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out tonight. The hostess was a little odd but other than that, we had a great experience sitting at the bar. Great beer selections and the food was great. Someone commented about the food being salty. I hate salt and didn't find anything to be too salty. I found the food to be better than tako after our experience there. Reasonably priced and great service at the bar!"}
{"text":"I thought Pork & Beans was very good.  It's a pretty popular spot right in downtown Pittsburgh.  I was staying across the street at the Renaissance and this place is located directly across the street so it was easy to walk to.  I grabbed a spot at the bar and was debating between a pulled pork platter or a pulled pork sandwich.  I went with the pulled pork sandwich.  Service was very good throughout and they probably had about 20+ beers on tap with a number I had never heard of so props to them there.    The pulled pork sandwich was borderline excellent.  The pork wasn't dry at all which it can sometimes be and it came with pickles and fried jalapenos which complemented the sandwich nicely.  I wasn't blown away by their selection of BBQ sauces which was slightly disappointing for a BBQ joint.  The fries were actually some of the more unique fries I've ever had.  If you can follow this - they were almost like large steak wedges / fries then battered and deep fried.  It was almost like a breaded Buffalo wing coating but not spicy at all.  They were interesting to say the least and also probably incredibly unhealthy.    It was a cool spot.  If back in the area, I would definitely go to again.  Prices were pretty reasonable for good food in a downtown spot.  No parking but there was a parking garage fairly close."}
{"text":"Great food and great service but the seating arrangements were just terrible. Would you like to spend your time making a reservation for 2 at 6:30pm only to have to sit shoulder to shoulder with another couple? It was so awkward having the hostess take us to our \"table\" to find that it was between two couples sitting across from each other. Booth? No. it's a picnic table and the only way you get to sit is across from each other. The middle party also has to ask either of the other strangers at the table for silverware, napkins, and the selection of sauces. It really shows the greed and utter disconnect with the general public when you spend the time to call in ahead and get a seat literally (not figuratively) between 2 other couples who are forced to sit across a table. The waitress \"Deb or Debbie? Was amazing\" and the food was over priced but good for downtown, but really the seating arrangements and greed by the owners was disappointing. If you prefer to even have enough space to have a conversation I would definitely avoid this place. The seating is a disaster. Even with a reservation, they reward you by seating in the same place. Imagine a high school lunch table and literally having to sit shoulder to shoulder with a stranger. So awkward. The food and service were awesome though."}
{"text":"ordered pulled pork. Four kinds of sauce but none is sweet. More sour favor so not my type"}
{"text":"If you're really hungry, this is the place to go. I went with a group of 5, and we each ordered a sandwich, split 2 orders of dirty fries, and split 3 sides. We had a ton of leftovers.The potato salad was too spicy for my taste, although the mac and cheese is great. My favorite was the classic brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"Good food!   Had the brisket and ribs.   Burnt tip beans were tasty.   Beet salad was excellent.   Great beer selection too."}
{"text":"Pretty much what you would expect from a nicer bbq spot, and then some. Chicken sandwich and the ribs are my go to."}
{"text":"This was just okay. The pulled pork was decent, the potato salad was so rich I could only eat a spoon or two, beans were just okay. Better bbq elsewhere."}
{"text":"there are some things I don't like, deviled eggs are one. We ordered them anyway, not my choice.  But they were amazing and when we go back I would order them again. Our waiter was both patient and informative as we needed some assistance with menu and portion size questions We shared the brisket. Our choice was lean. It was still moist and tender and something I would highly recommend We finished with an ice cream sandwich great evening."}
{"text":"First meal in Pittsburgh and it did not disappoint. Awesome atmosphere and even better food. Mac n cheese was absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great food, brisket and pulled pork was delicious. My wife loved their beet salad. A lot of good beers on draft and whiskeys stocked at the bar. I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Colorful rustic eclectic interior design is this restaurant's strong point. The food is predominately smoke house. When I came to Pittsburg several months ago a local recommended this place. I was not drawn in by the name and had no idea is had food such as pulled pork ( which is one of my favorite dishes), brisket and ribs and more. If I had realized that I would have been more interested in going. I really had a nice time at Pork and Beans. I had the Kim Chi pulled pork as I like to try new things. I have to say their Mac and cheese was stupendous ( a three cheese blend). We all enjoyed our meals. The other three guests with me got the family platter the portions that the waiter suggested were more than enough. My Moscow mule type drink was fabulous I loved the blend and the smoked taste. I am a bit of a bread snob My husband loves potato rolls not my thing at all I would have loved to see a bakery style bread option as well.       I really enjoyed trying all the different sauces too. I give them an A for atmosphere and interior design but a B+/A- for food. I think it would help if they had a non smoke house option on the menu to change it up a little bit.   Overall I liked this restaurant and had a great time."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Union Pig and Chicken and am still sad that they closed. I was excited to hear about Pork and Beans and have wanted to check it out since it opened, but could never score a table as the restaurant always had a wait and reservations were hard to come by. We recently tried Chef Michael Symon's Mabel's BBQ up and Cleveland and loved it so we definitely had to compare the two. I was totally shocked when my wife surprised me by taking me to Pork and Beans for Father's Day.   Being that it was Father's Day and a Pirate baseball game was starting shortly there were just a few other families when we arrived for our reservation. Once we were seated at a table Kylie our waitress came to tell us how the menu worked and take our drink orders. It was pretty much identical to Mabel's so we had a good idea what we wanted to order. The seating is communal which I usually despise, but since the restaurant wasn't crowded I didn't mind it so much. They do offer a few booths as well.  My wife and I were only going to just drink water, but after both tasting our daughter's Boylan Cream Soda which was delicious by the way we both ordered one for ourselves, but at $4 a glass next time we will all just drink water.  As far as the meat goes we went with the Pork Belly, Spare Ribs, Brisket and 1/4 Fried Chicken Dark Meat (drumstick and thigh). For our sides we chose the Collard Greens, Mac & Cheese and Burnt Ends and Beans. The pork belly was out of this world. It was melt in your mouth good! Like meat flavored butter. The brisket and spare ribs were quite tasty also. Very moist and tender enough to cut with a fork. There are four different barbecue sauces on the table. I only tried the mustard based sauce as that is the type I usually prefer. It was tanging, but too watery for my taste.  The fried chicken was outstanding. Perfectly cooked with a nice hard crust outside and tender meat inside. Not as good as Union Pig, but close. I really liked the honey tabasco barbeque sauce that came with the chicken. It had a slight kick and was quite unique. My only complaint is that the two pieces of chicken were quite small for $8. Next time I will just get a half chicken.  The collard greens were tender and cooked to perfection with just the right amount of seasoning. The mac & cheese could of had more cheese and I would have prefered for the noodles to have been slightly more al dente. The burnt ends and beans were not your usual bake beans. They were quite different as they featured several different types of beans, but were still enjoyable.   The pickles, cabbage and onion garnishes on the tray were a nice touch. I really like the fact that they give you diner rolls as well so you can make little barbeque sandwiches if you so chose. Once we were finished Kylie packed up the rest of our food and even packed us some of all four of their barbeque sauces.  So how does Pork and Beans stack up to Mabel's? I think that they are neck and neck. Both are similar and different at the same time. Even the decor is similar. Mabel's doesn't take reservations, have fried chicken or mac and cheese, but their ribs and brisket are superior so Mabel's squeaks out the win. Barely."}
{"text":"Like everyone else, I could NOT wait to try this restaurant.  I was able to snag a reservation for last Saturday and it was everything I expected and more.  We were lucky enough to get sat at one of the booths, which offered some nice privacy.  I planned on getting one of the amazing cocktails but I literally couldn't pass up a PBR 40.  I mean come on, it's served in a paper bag.  We ordered a little bit of everything.  The daily deviled eggs were something with pistachio and were so good I forgot they were even deviled eggs I was eating.  The pork sticks were probably my favorite part of the entire meal and will hopefully land a spot on the menu permanently.  We also tried the pulled pork, homemade hotdog and mac and cheese (I am bold enough to say possibly the best mac and cheese I've ever had, sorry Smoke).  And if that wasn't enough, we were offered a choice of a Leona's ice cream sandwich or Millie's ice cream for dessert.  Our waitress was fantastic and answered all of our questions.  Service was so good I almost forgot this place had only been opened a little over a week.  I can't wait to go back.  Bring friends and order as much as you can!"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try Pork & Beans since walking past the \"coming soon\" sign in its front window last summer.  Our BBQ roots are from Texas and we haven't had tremendous luck in finding true, smoked meats with authentic sides while spending some of our time in Pittsburgh.  The restaurant has an eclectic, yet rustic feel.  I'm not crazy about the metal fencing that separates the bar area from the restaurant and equally not crazy about the long, communal tables that provide most of the seating.  The beer list is extensive.  We ordered chicharrones to start with; crispy, fried pork rinds served with a slightly spicy remoulade.  We followed with brisket, pulled pork, collard greens and mac&cheese.  The meats were flavorful; but the brisket could have had a slightly more smoky flavor.  The collard greens were tasty, but some of the grit that can be found from less-than-fully rinsed greens was still present.  The mac & cheese was sinfully rich.  Pork & Beans comes the closest yet in delivering the BBQ tradition that these two Texans have been searching for in the land of Three Rivers.  Kudos."}
{"text":"If your in the mood for BBQ and in Pittsburgh you have to go here. We took the kids for a 3 day holiday in downtown Pittsburgh and this was recommended to us by the Marriot Concierge. It did not disappoint. The staff is super friendly even let us go back and see the smoker when I asked about it. The 5 of us shared a double order of brisket, the pulled pork and pork belly along with mac n cheese, beans and broccoli salads. The brisket was incredible. Perfectly done and the rub had a great blend of sweet and savory so it needed no sauce. We will be going here the next time we are in the Burgh."}
{"text":"Here we go on the review for this one. The brisket sandwich slider was 5 Stars all the way. The brisket was tender, moist, and very flavorful. Definately would order again!  Then I had the crab fritters. They were a little dark and I thought they were going to taste burnt from being deep fried too long. However, these were pretty good but lacking on crab meat all the way. These deserve  3 1/2 stars.  Then I went with the smoked wings bbq flavored. Oh boy was this a mistake. I took one bite of a flat wing and there was no way to describe the flavor except that it tasted like feet and no, I don't know what feet actually taste like...So what did I do? I tried one bite of another one and that was the same thing. So the wings.....big zero stars !  The crowd was a mix of ages and styles so it was comfortable. Taking everything into account, I'll go back but I won't do the wings again."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. The spare ribs were awesome. Great atmosphere. We sat at the outdoor seating right on 6th Ave. good drink selection. I will definitely go back. Not too expensive either."}
{"text":"Prepare yourself to potentially suffer from The Meat Sweats.  This is precisely what happened to my friend after we consumed 1/2 lb of brisket, 1/2 lb of ribs, mac n cheese, burnt end beans, and 80 oz of light beer.  The beer was divided into two 40 oz bottles and served in brown paper bags - charming.  Back to the Meat Sweats, after trudging back to my apartment, which is about a mile uphill, my friend starts sweating profusely and looking quite uncomfortable as we ride up the elevator.   He's looking dangerously ill and is asked if he'll be ok, need any Tums, etc.  He claims he'll be alright so is safely driven back to L-ville.  He later claims to have slept for 12 hours straight in a recliner.  Do not underestimate the power of animal proteins and fats.  4 stars.  The brisket and burnt end beans are key."}
{"text":"This place was worth the hype! After years of reading reviews in The Week, I finally found a place that I could actually visit. I was a little nervous, because the on-line comments all said that this place could sometimes be packed, but to my luck, a snow storm seemed to keep most people at home. I have to say that this place was a pretty cool looking restaurant, I really liked the communal seating, you don't see that very often. But since I was alone, I just found a spot at the bar. As always, I went with the Brisket, which did not let me down. It was the perfect fat to meat ratio that I was looking for. Even though I did not need too, I used all the sauces, which were pretty outstanding. I also had the potato wedges, which were okay, probably next time I will try one of the other sides. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I will absolutely be heading back."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic time last night celebrating my husband's birthday! The waitress did a great job at not only recommending meat choices, but giving us so guidance on how to order for a large group due to the \"family style\" servings! Within our group of 7, we ordered beef ribs, brisket, spare ribs, pulled pork, and a homemade hotdog. We also ordered some sides including potato salad, ranch coleslaw, jo-jo fries, and deviled eggs. As an appetizer, we ordered dirty fries which were delicious! When it came to our meals, all of the meat was phenomenal... melted in your mouth and full of flavor! Didn't need any sauces for any of them! The sides were good, but next time we are just going to stick to the dirty fries as an app and meat only as our meals  We want to save room for more meat!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 5. Everyone loved it. The food was fantastic and the service excellent. The beer list and drinks were also great. The only thing I would say is that it is a bit too salty. But the flavor and tenderness of the meet was amazing. We had the potato skins with pork belly. Wow. Loaded fries that had goodness on top including jalapeños and brisket. For entrees we had the pork shank (my fav), brisket (husbands fav), jalapeño kielbasa sandwich topped with puller pork, goat cheese, and crispy fried onion (looked amazing) and a fried chicken sandwich that was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy inside. All of us were stuffed and we took home quite a bit of food. Generous portions and great libations. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Exactly what downtown Pittsburgh was missing: good BBQ! Everything we tried was amazing, but my favorite would have to be the brisket: incredibly moist and flavorful with the perfect bit of smoked flavor. All the meats had an incredible rub on them. In fact, I don't think any additional sauce was needed on any of the meats. However, there were four different bottles of sauces (an original sweet sauce, tangy Carolina style sauce, a hot sauce similar to Franks, and a seasonal) at each table in case you like your BBQ extra saucy. My favorite sauce was the seasonal cranberry BBQ sauce but I presume that sauce will rotate.   As with any other Richard DeShantz restaurant (Meat and Potatoes, Tako, Butcher and the Rye), you are guaranteed a wonderful dining experience from the themed decor to the service to the food, but also expect the large bill at the end of your visit.    Some things to note, however, are the awkward communal tables and shared sink in the bathrooms. Try to get a booth if you can. Otherwise, you'll be elbow to elbow with strangers. Also, the food comes out in a family-style tray without any type of order. So to avoid the confusion of what is whose, I would recommend ordering the menu items with the intention of sharing them with your group.   Overall, if you can get over the awkward dining situation, I highly recommend the food and drinks!"}
{"text":"We have been a great fan of Pork & Beans since it opened in Pittsburgh's Cultural District. It was a fabulous place to taste some great beer and enjoy a wonderful dinner. On our last venture there on 5/12/18, we were sorely disappointed in the \"new\" menu. The offerings had been paired down so much, that our favorites were not there. Gone were the deviled egg of the day, the Hot Brown, and numerous salads.   Then there was the service. The beer offerings also change frequently. When we asked our waiter about what dark beers he could recommend nothing. He had no idea about what was actually on the menu. We had to ask if we could do a taste test instead of he offering it. He checked back only once to see if we needed anything right after our meals were served. Then he disappeared from view until returning to ask if we wanted another beer. When we said no, he left and brought the check. No asking about dessert, which we usually enjoyed there because of the ice cream sandwiches.   I am not sure if the place is under new management or what, but I didn't see any of our favorite servers. The food was ok, portions a bit smaller and now served on school cafeteria trays instead of the metal ones from before. Also the checks are now just put on the table and not presented in Campbell Soup cans, which is really an insignificant thing, but one  that added to the ambience.   Will be looking for another favorite place to eat before shows and concerts."}
{"text":"Positives:  Food was really good.  Large servings.  Price was reasonable. Negatives:  Very loud acoustics, very dark (can't see menu), and not enough local breweries on tap.  Need to have a more local inclusive tap list."}
{"text":"This place came recommended when visiting Pgh!!! I came with my in laws and we opted out of the family style course to get 3 of the shareable meals (sorry don't remember what they called them)... however it was way more food then needed!!! Took this back to the hotel and enjoyed it!!! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Stuck us at the end of a picnic which booths open. Made a reservation-to be crowded for no apparent reason   Order out!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. I went with friends on a Saturday night, we made reservations, but it didn't seem grossly overcrowded when we got there at 7. The drinks were really cool, and they seemed to have a decent beer selection as well. I got the 1/2 lb of brisket, and I was so happy I did. They give you buns and toppings to make sandwiches and there was enough for me to take home which is always a treat. The mac and cheese was great!   I will say that the service was a little disappointing. The waitress we had was very nice, but didn't really tell us too much about the menu. I thought this was odd, considering this is a new restaurant so it should have been a safe assumption we may not have been there before. As I said I got the brisket, but I didn't know it would be coming with topping and sides to make a sandwich. It was a pleasant surprise for sure, but should it have been a surprise? There are sauces on each table, but we were never told what any of them were.  I'm hoping they work out those kinks as the time passes, because this is a great new spot. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, fun cocktails, and good BBQ options. All of the sides, apps, and BBQ platter options were great. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the \"pork and beans\" - it sounded better on the menu than what it actually was and it's not worth paying $24 for the scant amount of pork it comes with. Stick with the pulled pork and brisket - those are yum."}
{"text":"First night in Pittsburgh found this cool bbq joint, nice atmosphere great service and great food.  My group had the dirty fries , turkey and pulled pork all were excellent.   It's hard for me  rave about bbq when I have such an amazing bbq joint back home but this place will nor disappoint.   Made a reservation and was seated immediately apon arrival."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere but the food was mediocre and not as described.   When I request a \"sandwich,\" as it is listed on the menu, I don't mean a heap of meat with a tiny unoriginal roll from a grocery store. For three \"sandwiches\" on a tray, the tiny bit of fixins was disappointing. Perhaps if the meat were great enough to stand on its own...  I got pork, but tried the brisket too. Sliced brisket is always a bummer, and other than that, I found it inedible. My friend didn't even want to take home what she didn't eat. It was super salty and fatty--and yeah, I get the trend toward fattier tender pork, but this made me gag.   I wouldn't recommend this place. Especially for the sad overpriced \"sandwich.\" Go get yourself some real barbecue that spends more energy on its flavor and quality than its image."}
{"text":"Ordered spare ribs which are on the menu and a recommendation. They were out of them and it would be an hour to get them. Awful logistical management."}
{"text":"It was alright. Tasty enough to eat. Not tasty enough to return.  This is a little eatery in the Container Park. They mostly have hot dogs (er, sausages) and pork and beans. They also have a couple of draft beers, soda, and water.  The wait to order was nil. The wait to get our order was over 20 minutes. Not exactly worth the wait.  There is some seating inside and plenty of seating outside.  The pork and beans we had was a decent-sized portion. It had an ok flavor. But it wasn't really all that good. Again, good enough to eat if you're hungry. But not good enough that I'd order it again. Maybe other menu items are more worth it?"}
{"text":"Not a good experience, service was not good and we waited over 25 mins or more before our food came out and the place was not crowded at all when we arrived so why we had to wait so long? And the waitress never came pass to say anything about why the food was taking so long. No ice in the water it's served out of green old wine bottles chilled at first but as long as we waited all we had to drink was warm water our appetizers were long gone! It was Mother's Day and we were hungry and I ordered a peach drink but it was actually what looked and tasted like a mojito minus the mint leaves! I'm just saying cause it was a $10 drink and the waitress took it without asking was I finished with it!!!! I give it 2 stars because I was so hungry I did eat the food! But the service was horrible folks just walking back and forth appearing to be doing NOTHING!!!!! And when you look over and see people that literally just came in and they are being served their full meals not appetizers it makes you say \"WE AINT NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN\""}
{"text":"Stopped in Pork & Beans because of a recommendation and it did not disappoint! Kevin C was our waiter and was top notch! Friendly and helpful and gave great recommendations. We ordered the brisket, pulled pork, Mac n cheese and beans and shared it between two. It was definitely more than enough for two people. We started with a beer flight of four and chose two of our favorites. The atmosphere is trendy and comfortable. We will definitely recommend it to others! Thanks for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Our first experience was perfect.  The service and food were amazing.  Cool atmosphere and the restaurant is in a great location downtown.  The parking garage a half a block down the street made it so easy to get in and out.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Ordered a platter with 2 different meats and three sides. The meat was good but the sides were not at all. Probably the worst mac n cheese I've ever tasted. It was a take out order, I can't say what the service is like"}
{"text":"This food is definitely way above average.  The quality and taste of the brisket and pulled pork was amazing.  Definitely some of the best in the city.  The mac and cheese was my second favorite in the city, but still excellent. It was on the creamier side, so if that is what you like, you will love it.  The broccoli salad was the only food that was only so-so.  I would have picked something else instead.  Probably should have gotten the beans!  My friend got one of the Leona's ice cream sandwiches for dessert.  They just put it on a plate wrapped, no other presentation or anything.  You can probably skip this next time and just go buy your own Leona's somewhere else for cheaper.  The only other gripe was the fact that we were sat a large communal table.  I'm sorry, but I find this new fad annoying.  It's awkward for the people next to you.  It's hard to get in and out of the bench seating with people right next to you.  You have to crawl over the bench to put your feet in.  I wish they had more small tables next to one another.  Even if they were super close, it would still be better than this communal table BS.  Overall the experience was good, but it could still be better."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for dinner on December 19, 2017.   My issue is the wait staff (Katerina).  While the waitress was explaining the menu she knocked over a full glass of water which landed in my lap.  She apologize and handed me a towel and then quickly walked away.  So I ate my meal soaked to the skin.  Not enjoyable.   My problem the manager never stopped by to check in?   They did not even offer a free dessert?   I would think twice as I am sure you will get better service at a less expensive restaurant."}
{"text":"Speaks for itself, awesome service, delicious food, great environment. Worth every penny spent. Definitely try the Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Great location and casual atmosphere just across the river from PNC Park.  Ample selection of beers and spirits with friendly and knowledgeable bartenders."}
{"text":"Perfect. So much fun. Delicious food , great staff. Just awesome. Get the dirty fries, the brisket the pulled pork the tri-tip - it was all so good... barbecue sauce is amazing! tons of drinks and Super fun... can't talk about it enough"}
{"text":"Been there twice now and the food is consistently awesome. The brisket is as good as any I have had in Texas. They also have some great sides and a variety of sauces that are fun to play with. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here tonight and it was an interesting experience. The food was excellent. I got the daily special of the brisket grilled cheese. Big portion and tons of flavor. I got the flavor from the brisket, American cheese, and whiz cheese coming together and almost making it like a BBQ version of a Philly cheesesteak. It was a little messy but it was very creamy with the cheese which I loved.   A few things I wasn't a fan of are that the service wasn't great. Our waiter was very inattentive and disappeared for long periods of time. I get that they were busy but I expected a little more service wise. It was also a little louder in there than I'd have liked- not a major thing but a slight inconvenience since it made conversation with the rest of my group a little more difficult. Also for most of my time there my phone had no service which surprised me since they had the place open to the patio since it was such a nice night out.   The negatives other than service were small things but the service has to be better. I'd give the food a 5 star review and the whole experience a 3 star review. But since it was one time with bad service I'll give them a 5 for now and see if the service is better next time I go...the food was well worth taking another trip for next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We got the pulled pork, pastrami pork belly, mac n cheese, and potato salad along with the specialty ribs for an appetizer.  Everything was delicious, and our server was great!"}
{"text":"The Dirty Fries appetizer was amazing, we loved the barbecue sauce on it. Unfortunately, the pork in the entree was too salty to even consume. The waitress told us the barbecue sauce on the fries matched the \"Original\" one on the table, but they tasted completely different. All the sauces were very sweet minus the buffalo and we weren't fans. Good appetizers, great atmosphere, but an unfortunately very disappointing entree."}
{"text":"We went to Pork & Beans recently to celebrate my husband's birthday, and I'm so glad we chose to celebrate there! Since we'd never been, we took advantage of the ability to try a bunch of things via their \"family style\" menu, paired with the Blue Plate Special (gives you smaller portions of two meats and two sides). Everything we had was phenomenal, cooked perfectly and exactly what we were hoping for. We also took advantage of their really great happy hour specials - $5 craft beers and select $5 appetizers. The Buffalo Stout smoked chicken wings were the perfect start to our meal. The a la carte sides were a bit on the pricey side for what you get, but they were delicious as well and I think that it was worth the opportunity to try them! We will absolutely be back next time we're looking for good BBQ."}
{"text":"READ: Went with a group of 5 people to Pork and Beans on a Saturday night. Ordered some drinks, which were good. Our waiter was knowledgeable on the drinks. We then ordered the pig ears, jalapeño corn bread and the appetizer fries. All of these items were solid and I would order them again. I won't go through all of the food because all of it has good taste and it was enjoyable. Though, they could bring out more bread and pickles with your meals.  HOWEVER, the presentation and operations of the dining experience is a mess. They bring ALL of your food out on a giant cafeteria tray. This is a unfortunate for folks who want to eat their meals in a non sharing way. Secondly, the plates that they gave you to eat on are like a silver dollar! Food fell off of my plate and it was generally an uncomfortable dining experience. If you're going to force people to eat in a communal setting, then at least give them a proper way to eat it. If the presentation had been different, so would the rating and I bet I'm on the only one."}
{"text":"Great tasty bbq. A tad pricey which doesn't include downtown parking. They had a bbq sauce with maple syrup infused. I highly suggest giving it a try."}
{"text":"The food and drinks at this place was really good! The server at dinner made up for the issues we had while waiting for our table.  The earliest reservations we could get were late so we arrived early so we could check in and have a drink or two while waiting on our table.  I let the hostess know we would be open to seating earlier if anything came available.  Unfortunately, we watched multiple spots for 2 people open or even while tables open and never got an early seat (which we were Ok with if it was actually full until our reservations).  We ended up getting a table right at our reservation time and it was made up with getting a private booth table and our server was awesome!  The mac and cheese, ribs, and brisket were something we highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Amazing food, great selection of beers, cool atmosphere. And the staff is super friendly. It's one of my Friday night go-to's for sure. Please bring back the standard pulled pork though! But otherwise everything here has been great"}
{"text":"I left very happy. The food was good, the portions were perfect, and the service was excellent. I ordered the spare ribs, roasted corn, and fries. Everything is ala carte, but the price is ended up being pretty reasonable given the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Great service. Quality food. Reasonable price.  I had a phase when I always ordered Cobb Salad if available and Pork & Beans did not disappoint me. My friend was also very satisfied with the taste and quality of her meat in her sandwich.  My major downside was the restaurant was very loud so I felt like I was shouting just to talk to my friend sitting a couple feet away from me.  --  taste / 5 aesthetics / 4 vibe / 3 service / 5 price for quality / 5 OVERALL / 4.5"}
{"text":"First time at P and B - went before Pens playoff game last eveming- Friendly and attentive service, atmosphere SO cool and LOVED everything we ordered (including cocktails. Reminds me of a little place we used to go when we lived in Texas  Already made reservations for another visit when my sons home from Boston!!!!!"}
{"text":"Located near the entrance of the Downtown Container Park. Do yourself a favor and walk around the park a little more before deciding what you're going to eat.  With a name like Pork & Beans you'd think I would get real excited. You can call me an expert to pork and beans. It is my favorite dish. I've had them all and eat it at least once at week. Van Camp's, Campbell's, Bush's, Heinz, etc. LOL  Kidding aside. Yeah I dunno about this place. Supposingly Pork & Beans is one of Kerry Simon's places, who I guess is a celebrity chef from what I read. The menu, at least the menu I was presented with, included items like pork and beans, chili, sliders, hot dog, and few more ranging from $4-$9. Nothing that seemed impressive. It was more like I'm not gonna pay $9 for a hotdog especially when I just saw a sign across the street at El Cortez for a prime rib meal for $9.99.  I did however decide to try something, went with the Fancy Grilled Cheese being that it was priced in the middle at $7. It was aged cheddar with basil and tomato in a sourdough, seemed promising, it had \"Fancy\" in the name. But when it arrived I was truly disappointed. It really was just 2 slices of bread with a very little cheese, tomato, and basil. The fillings didn't even reach the edges of the bread and didn't even come with anything extra like fries or pork and beans. For $7 and from a chef or \"celebrity chef\" I would've expected more. Fancy!? I little kid could've done better. Let's just say I went to the nearest grocery store buy a loaf of bread, some cheese, a bag of tomato, and other items, even a can of pork and beans and go have a 5 year old make something fancy and better for about $7. I wonder what my food would have been like if I paid a dollar or 2 more.  Even though I didn't try anything else, from what I saw in pictures and what came out to others I wouldn't mine giving them a 1 also, a 2 star might be generous. I even heard table next to me making fun of their food. They should've added a side of pork and beans to each item for the same price charged.  You don't have to go to Pork & Beans to get their food. There was a waitress going around the 2nd floor tables near Boozery, seemed weird since she gave me a drinks menu from the bar downstairs and a food menu from Pork & Beans which was all the way on the other side. She brought me food so I paid her."}
{"text":"Overall great experience, loved the atmosphere. Highly recommend checking this place out! Items I would order again, pulled pork, Mac and cheese and for drinks the Mule. We were disappointed with the brisket, a bit dry and not a lot of flavor. We also did not love the corn, it was not what we were expecting. We assumed it was going to be more of a corn bread/casserole, but it came out more as a spicy soup."}
{"text":"Love the pork schnitzel. It was too die for. The egg on top was it's crowning glory. Yummo!!!!"}
{"text":"OmG! Fantastic bar tenders, fantastic food and amazing atmosphere. Meal is worth the wait. Family style dining makes the experience very worth it. Three of us ate for around $100. Super affordable and casual"}
{"text":"This place was pretty decent. There were a few menu items I really enjoyed. The dirty fries, corn fitters, and the ribs. I also tried the Nachos, brisket, Mac n cheese, greens, and tenderloin..... all pretty basic. The vibe of the place was like I want to be a BBQ spot but I also want to be trendy. Not bad if you don't mind commercialized BBQ."}
{"text":"Solid fare, just the way I like it - tender beans, and heavy heavy on the Pork in the one every has to love - the classic.  This place can take care of my ravenous appetite indeed."}
{"text":"Pretty good option if you're interested in BBQ.  Cool decor, must try the dry rub wings, and yummy salad.  Tried 3 kinds of meat - pulled pork (7 out of 10), brisket (8/10) and spare ribs (7 out of 10).  Let's put it this way - you wouldn't have to hog tie me to come back, but \"s'nout\" my first choice"}
{"text":"Went for dinner. The decoration in the restaurant is very fun: chain link fence, cool sink in the bathroom, Coca Cola bin, etc. Food was very solid. I would say a good choice if you want to get BBQ with friends in Pittsburgh.  Got pork rinds as an app, and also got pulled pork and brisket. I found the pork rinds a little on the salty side, although I get that I should expect that.  Maybe I should try their pig ears next time? BBQ was good, nothing to complain about. I would recommend the brisket. For the price, I wish the portions were just a little bigger though! Also they have 4 types of sauces on the tables, which is really fun to experiment with but I really wish they had a different kind of bottle. They're kind of hard to use and also they're all sticky."}
{"text":"Great bbq! Really fun atmosphere, you sit at long communal tables and eat on cafeteria trays. But it's still a nice place to go and sit for a little while, with great cocktails.  If Hill Country BBQ is a 5 this is a close 4."}
{"text":"I have always like this concept of family style with BBQ.  Pork and Beans is a great place to grab some food, hungry or not hungry.  They have portions that can fulfill every appetite.  Don't get weirded out by pimento cheese on the menu.  It was awesome.  Leona's ice cream sanwiches.  Mac and cheese.  G_G_G_Great.  (when your food comes, use everything on your tray, pickled items, meat, bread, make a sandwich add a pickle.  Sidenote:  the jalapenos are no joke)  We walked in on a Tuesday at around 4:30 and got a seat at the bar.  The other tables are cafeteria style and you sit very close to your friendly strangers.  They do have booths, if you would like your privacy.  By 5:30, ON A TUESDAY, that place was bumpin, from the business men to the foodie hipsters.  A super diverse crowd.     A little pricey, but worth the atmosphere and buzz."}
{"text":"Got the pulled pork platter and split a mac and cheese. Left completely satisfied and stuffed! Incredible barbecue and great sauces varieties. Cool decor and environment right in the heart of downtown. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ribs are amazing! Pulled pork quesadilla is more of an entree size than appetizer. Our first meal in Pittsburgh during a weekend trip getaway, overall great experience."}
{"text":"Kudos for creativity. When you walk into P & B you're not in Pittsburgh anymore. I'm not sure WHERE you are, but it isn't here. Don't get me wrong - I like it! The food was very solid. My guest and I both ordered the pulled pork and, because it was the same dish, it was served family-style. I don't love that...at all. If it's a family-style restaurant, ok. But only because we happened to order the same thing? Silly, and potentially awkward depending on your companion, if you ask me. Also not a huge fan of communal bench seating. I get that it's a hipster thing, but why make a concerted effort to make dining less than comfortable? I don't get it, so I'll shut up and order takeout next time ;)"}
{"text":"Delicious but not mind blowing. Loved our pulled pork and brisket. Great sauces especially the Classic and the Seasonal (Cilantro Peach). Deviled eggs--horseradish & brisket--were amazing! Good drinks. Service though was only so-so."}
{"text":"Kerry Simon has disappointed me. With use of such high quality ingredients I know something spectacular could have taken place. Maybe it's because their new, maybe I am just not a fan. Either way, this spot did not impress.  I was so excited to first go to Container Park, and second, try new food. Of course one of my first choices would be the Kerry Simon place. Plus the BBQ joint was out of ribs and brisket! This seemed like the place to go. My boyfriend and I each ordered the Boss hog. A sausage on a fresh roll with their house made spicy mustard and grilled red peppers. Not really what the description read, however that's what we received. Also ordered Kerry's famous sliders, chili, and mac and cheese.  First complaint, not that it's small (hello name container park) but the fact that when sitting outdoors, we didn't have the option of the cool tray with a pickled relish, spicy ketchup, and Dijon mustard. And when I asked for a tray, the lady was confused and said \"well what would you like I'll get you a side\" I should have said everything on the tray, however I simply got mustard and sat down. In the cold, outside, without a working heater. As I watched every other place have a heater on, P&B, did not.  Second complaint, we clearly said we were sharing an order of sliders, and somehow we received 2 orders. (I was wondering why our bill was so much)  I was hoping these sliders would be over the top amazing. Nope. Good quality beef, a fresh tomato, and TINY piece of bacon that didn't even reach every bite, and some onion jam that was bland. Disappointment all around other than the actual quality of meat. In the sandwich and the sliders, I could tell the meat was decent.  The chili was probably the best thing we had. If you like meat and not beans, this ones for you. However it needed a dollop of sour cream and some onions! Maybe even crackers?! Not just cheese.   The mac and cheese was super average. The flavor would have been OKAY, had it not been over spiced with fresh herbs. I don't think a hint of mint goes well in mac and cheese personally.  We were sitting there saying \"we should have gotten tacos, look at those heaters working.\"  If I hear about a turnaround, or them \"working out the kinks\" maybe I'd return. But honestly, it isn't likely."}
{"text":"My husband's had brisket in Dallas and Austin, and said this was BETTER. Prior to this meal I wasn't a huge fan of BBQ, but I am now obsessed with bone marrow, and brisket. Our bartender Riley could not have been better--great service, and extremely knowledgeable about what was gluten free (I have Celiac's), to the point where after I told him why I needed a GF meal he took the cider I had ordered away (apparently the brewers had changed their recipe), and replaced it with a delicious GF beer I'd never heard of it before, but am now a huge fan of! We'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Pork & Beans, I was impressed.  I visited on a Tuesday night, during Happy Hour, and the bar area was packed, some type of Mixer event.  Most of those attendees were standing, so I did find a place at the bar.  The bartender approached me right away, explaining the menu and taking my order.  I started with the Happy Hour wings, dry rub, and a Frose cocktail.  My entree, included the jalapeno cheddar smoked sausage link, with mac-n-cheese and collard greens.  The Frose was excellent!  Frozen wine cocktail, very tasty.  The wings were not as flavorful as I would have hoped, but cooked well, and much better once I dipped in 2 of the house bbq sauces, the traditional and tangy mustard, mixed.   My entree arrived, a short time later, I was hoping for a plain smoked sausage, but of the 4 offered that day, none were plain, there was a seafood chowder sausage (pass:-), and 2 other selections.  I opted for the jalapeno cheddar and was pleasantly surprised, larger portion that other bbq places, nice flavor and not too spicy.  The mac-n-cheese was tasty too, a bit rich, but good.  The greens were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Both sides were generously portioned.   I had enough of the entree left, for lunch the next day.   All-in-all, this was a great meal, along with great service.  I would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"A great place to eat, drink and talk with friends.  Our group was large and they accommodated us easily.   Kevin is a great waiter, he took care of us and the rest of the restaurant team was great too.  The food is incredibly good.  Get the sausage sampler.  Be sure to get the brisket and grilled cheese sandwich.  Mmmmmm.    Collard greens are surprising excellent.  A must visit.  5 minute walk to the stadiums. Will be back next time in town."}
{"text":"The meats are AMAZING!  Smoked, lean and tender.  The BBQ chips were very different....and enjoyable. Loved the Cranberry BBQ seasonal sauce. Only disappointment was the beans....not sweet at all. I like brown sugar/molasses beans. Very noisy. Drinks were incredible."}
{"text":"If you're trying to eat healthy this is not the place to go. Not any healthy options on the menu. I got the Turkey Devonshire- the turkey was excellent, but it was swimming in the sauce. Everything is extremely salty as well. Another in our party got the smoked corn side - it was good, but would have been much better without all the spices. We also tried the \"Piggy Ears\" - again way too much spice.  Best choices in our group were the pulled-pork sandwich and the dirty fries."}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times and I'll eat here again.  It's a little pricey for what you get, but the quality of food is top notch. We have tried the grilled cheese,  The Pork-tugese, Classic Pork & Beans, The Pig-Freed and Roy, and chocolate covered bacon.   The cashier and chef are always super friendly. If he's not busy he comes out from the kitchen to chat a bit."}
{"text":"If there is one cuisine I love, it is BBQ. I was so excited for this place. I haven't been able to get beyond the brisket. It is smoky, juicy, tender.  Perfection. The sauces will also fit any taste. The house is a standard BBQ, a hot that is spicy, but manageable, a mustard base (my favorite), and a seasonal. The seasonal rock, don't miss out. For sides, I've tried the collard greens and baked beans. Both thumbs up. As a big fan of Mac and cheese, I was disappointed. It was a tad bland for my taste. But, if you love smoked meat, go with the brisket and you won't be disappointed. I promise. Also, great beer list.   My only complaint is the seating. I am not a big fan of communal tables, but I suffer through them. What is really difficult to deal with is the bench seating. It is REALLY hard to gracefully mount the bench when you have to squeeze between people on both sides of you. Forget about it if you're in a skirt. Impossible. If they would replace the benches with actual chairs, it would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible,  DeShantz restaurant group knocks it out of the park yet again. I've lived in Austin ,Texas and I haven't felt this close to it since. The restaurant has a great community fun feel to it , drinks were really unique and tasty . Food was out of this world. Just get the beef rib; it's the only one you can get in the burgh right now and it surpassed expectations. It's Fred Flinstone sized and the marble of the beef mixed with the smokey burnt  taste and their classic BBQ sauce made for one of the best dishes I've had throughout the entire city.  We also tried the dirty fries (must have with the fried brisket on top) and the mac n cheese (velvetta based makes for a creamy homecooked taste). 5 out of 5 easily one of pittsburgh's best restaurants. We made another reservation on the way out."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town and come across this restaurant..loved the name and we love Mac & Cheese so we decided to stop for dinner there. It was a Sat. night around 7:00 pm when we arrived, the place is small (container) so I would say there was one family sitting next to us, one person inside just standing waiting for his order and I am not sure how many customers sitting outside waiting for their order. We order the Gourmet Toasted Cheese Sandwich, the 3 Cheese Mac & Cheese and the Sliders also 2 beers. The young lady taking our order acting like she really didn't wait to be there and didn't even ask if we wanted our beer as we waited so we just sat down.   After waiting 15 minutes and seeing another guy get his beer as soon as he ordered I went back to the young lady and asked if we could have or beer, she asked me if I wanted to order 2 beers I said no we already did and payed for them she then asked me what kind and finally got them. Now the family that was sitting next to us has received their food, ate it and had left and we are still waiting for our food, plus a worker from the BBQ place in Container Park came over order food after we had ordered and received it before it before we received our food..it is now 7:20 and we see a cheese sandwich sitting in the window and my husband says he is sure this one must be his..after about 5 minutes of sitting in the window the young lady finally brings the sandwich over to him....which was cold..had no taste, there was suppose to have basil on it..nope no basil..it was cold and dry sandwich...next came the mac & cheese...a little hotter but again if there was 3 cheeses in there I will eat a hat!   To me it tasted like a cold Macaroni Salad.  Most of the time when I have dinner with my husband I like to eat with him not in this case after my husband received his sandwich and mac/cheese and was eating while I still had to wait for my sliders..which I am happy to say were really good..I ended up letting my husband have one since his meal was so bad. So we thought would be a quick dinner turned into more than a hour, I would say they have some work to do, faster service and trained your staff to be a little more warmer. Would we eat there again, maybe I really did love sliders and my husband would like to try the pork and beans..so I hope next time is better."}
{"text":"I've been hearing rave reviews of this place on yelp, so figured before a pirates game would be a good opportunity. The food is served family style. The three of us eating each chose a different smoked meat (1/2 lb servings) and a side. The meal was served on a cafeteria tray. The deviled eggs and corn fritter starters were very good. We opted for brisket, pulled pork, and tri tip as our meats and baked beans, broccoli salad, & mac n cheese. The meats were all super tender and delicious. The sides were nothing special, while the baked beans were too smokey for my taste.  A great casual dining place before a game, but wouldn't go out of my way to make a trip."}
{"text":"Because we love all of Richard Deshantz's restaurants and were sad to see Keith Fuller's Root 174 close, my husband and I looked forward to trying their joint effort, Pork and Beans. Not only do we LOVE BBQ, but we also admire what these to are doing in and for the Pittsburgh restaurant scene.   We made reservations with another couple for a Tuesday night. Our friends arrived early and each ordered a scotch before we arrived. They did order good scotch, but were rather surprised at the $47 bill for two small pours. But, they enjoyed it and sipped contentedly throughout dinner.   When we arrived we were seated quickly, in a booth to the right. The space is open with muted lighting. There are long wooden tables with benches in the center, and a row of booths to the right. By the bar area there is a long high table for standing and enjoying your drink. I imagine this gets busy at happy hour! So seating is truly at a minimum, which is par for the course for downtown.   Once seated, we ordered our drinks. I chose the Repo Man, a tequila-based cocktail, and my husband had the Tennessee Ninja Mint Julep. They were both small pours and my husband's ended up being too sweet for him, so I kindly switched. (Aren't I the greatest wife ever?!) I will probably stick to ordering cocktails mainly at Meat and Potatoes or Bar Marco.   The food, while tasty, was not any better than our favorite BBQ place in Brookline, the Smoq Pitt. We started off with boiled in-shell peanuts, which are interesting and authentically southern yet not my favorite eat peanuts. Our main courses arrived only a few minutes after the peanuts, so we did not have much time for appetizers.   The servings at Pork and Beans are small, yet because they serve it family style there appears to be more than there is. My husband and our friends got the beef brisket, and I had the pulled pork. Sauces on the table include a spicy, sweet, hot, and mustard-based sauce. The pork was very lean, missing the fat of a normal cut of pork shoulder or butt. The sauce added some much-needed flavor. My husband said the brisket was good, but again not better than Smoq Pitt, and a much smaller portion for the price. We also had collard greens, which were unremarkable and not nearly as flavorful as they should be. They needed more pork flavor or bacon added. My husband tried the beans, which reminded him of a family reunion kind of dish, sweet and slightly bland. I am gluten free so I did not partake of the bread provided, but it looked to be simply buns or rolls that you could buy at Giant Eagle.   Overall, now that I am writing this review, I realize I am more disappointed than I originally thought. I know the restaurant is new and they are probably still figuring out the kinks, but I had expected more from such a prestigious pair. My husband thinks we should go back and try the more unique items on the menu, which I am happy to do to give this place another try."}
{"text":"There's something for you here, vegans. I highly suggest the Pig-Freed and Roy and the side of potatoes. They also have smart dogs upon request. If you have any questions about whether or not something is vegan, the friendly staff can answer any of your questions. If you get a chance to talk to Chef Mike he's a sweetheart."}
{"text":"I thought the meats were really good and could give 4 stars, but I thought the sauces were poor in quality. Classic was super sweet and was missing the usual BBQ kick, the spicy was more of a taco spice than what I'd expect from a BBQ joint.  Pork was really good, broccoli salad was good, mac and cheese was just ok.   Also, offer cornbread! Come on man..."}
{"text":"Great bbcue and extras. A bit loud for talking tho!"}
{"text":"A nice place, food was super tasty but I will only give 4 stars because the meat was kinda cold, the restaurant itself has a good vibe, really good price-quality food. Would totally recommend it"}
{"text":"Pork and Beans is pretty good. If you've been to Butcher and Rye or Meat and Potatoes, it's basically the same thing as far as atmosphere. Pork and Beans has the better beer selection and more space compared to the other two restaurants.  If you're looking for an hipster happy hour for a group, this is the place. Plenty of room, plenty of beer and liquor, and large appetizers. The wine selection is extremely limited,  but that's most places and to be expected.  We only had drinks and ended up getting several orders of the dirty fries since they were so good. I need to return to try the barbecue. The barbecue sauces were very good on fries."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Seriously the best BBQ and sides I've had in a long time. We tried the brisket, pulled pork, broccoli salad, burnt beans.  I highly recommend all of them. Also the have 40s! And pickle backs and mini boilermakers, which was nice because I didn't want to get full off beer.  So, the only bad thing is the seating! Extremely disappointing. We were seated in the MIDDLE of a long picnic bench table across from each other. Seriously? And I made reservations way in advance, which I guess didn't mean anything.. and there was empty tables that were empty the entire time we were there.  I highly recommend going with a party of 4 and requesting a private table on the side of the restaurant.  I mean several people were really pissed off in there over the seating.  Also, its winter, and they have no coat hooks, anywhere.  Not cool."}
{"text":"Very cool decor in the restaurant, love the set up. Food was delicious. Pricier, but meat is served family style meant to share. They recommend one meat and one side ordered per person and I would agree. Tried the brisket , pork belly, mac & cheese, and nachos. Would highly recommend them all"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Pork & Beans catering for your next event!  My family and I were searching for catering for a small event when we found P&B. We had eaten here before (and love it!) but didn't know they offered catering services. With relatively limited notice, P&B was more than accommodating. It was a 100% hassle free experience.   We picked up the food ourselves and everything was ready as soon as we arrived. The food was packaged up nicely, nothing spilled. We received more food than we could have imagined and everything tasted just as good as it does in the restaurant. What's more - they throw in rolls, bottles of sauces, and even towelettes.  We felt the price was very reasonable for the amount of food we received - $200 for 10 people (but probably would have fed more than 10, we had leftovers!).  My family and I were truly thrilled with the experience and wouldn't hesitate to have an event catered by Pork & Beans again."}
{"text":"Brisket: some of the best I have had Collard greens: off the charts Pork rinds: amazing Tri-tip: mind blowing seasoning Bbq sauce: great variety and interesting. Birch beer seasoned bbq sauce. I almost drank it with a straw.   This place does bbq right. They pay attention to the details as well. So, if you are a bbq aficionado, you will love it. If you are a person who thinks Chili's has good bbq, you will love it. They even get the presentation right. Sides of picked onions and carrots on a cool serving dish. Legit.   4 Stars because it looked like the service staff was a bit grumpy. Our server was awesome tho. Everyone else just looked mad. That's a red flag. Why the long faces?"}
{"text":"If you haven't voluntarily given yourself meat sweats recently, you need to check this place out. Highly recommend the pork belly and brisket - great flavor and the fat melts in your mouth. Seasonal sauce is a peach barbecue, which they could have poured on an old shoe and I still would have eaten it. The Frito pie is served like a walking taco with brisket ends, cheese whiz, and salsa Verde, so no complaints there. Dessert was a PB&J cheesecake served on a bed of toasted marshmallow with a peanut butter macaron as garnish. Make a reservation, thank me later."}
{"text":"Stopped in randomly while walking through downtown. We ordered the wings with a stout Buffalo sauce, a Chicago dog and burnt end beans. The Chicago dog was huge! So big, I had to eat it with a knife and fork! But it was very tasty, with the usual Chicago toppings except they use jalapeños instead of the little bar peppers. The burnt end beans had a good taste but they were a little crunchy. Maybe they needed to cook a bit more. Wings were very good. Not too messy. They have a ton of beers to choose from but only a few wines. Service was good."}
{"text":"Had the sliders and beans with kale. Very reasonable prices. Excellent quality. The burgers were cook perfectly. Maybe a touch more seasoning would make them even better. The beans were delicious. Kale and pinto beans. A bit unusual but delicious."}
{"text":"We're from Texas and this is the closest to our favored type of barbecue that we've found in the 412.  The tri-tip and the ribs are our favorites - be sure to add the burnt ends beans to your sides."}
{"text":"A difficult-to-choose variety of traditional barbecue meals served by engaging, friendly people in a fun space decorated with reclaimed materials. A great choice for a casual meal, a drink, or a pre-game nosh. Kid- and group-friendly. Limited (but appreciated!) vegetarian options. I had the brisket sandwich and potato salad - both winners."}
{"text":"This place is NOT messing around with flavor. I ordered a simple Cobb salad and WOW. the brined chicken keeps it juicy and the avocado and Gorgonzola make this salad a real meal. I needed a box for my salad it was so huge! My server grant was excellent as well. He had great timing and was able to anticipate my needs. I'm a server so I know that is a hard skill to learn! Absolutely will be coming back to enjoy the atmosphere and drink specials (when I'm not on a work lunch break )"}
{"text":"I love the interior here and the food is very good! It's pretty pricey, though, we got two sandwiches, an appetizer, and two drinks for like $50 for lunch.   The appetizer was the pork belly potato skins. You get 3 skins with a pretty big piece of pork belly on each, tons of sour cream, butter, chives, and cheese. These were really good but the potato needed cooked a little longer as they were still kind of hard.  The sandwiches were the brisket grilled cheese, and the fried chicken. Sandwiches come with kettle chips which were delightfully sweet with a little spice. The brisket grilled cheese was really ooey gooey with a ton of long strips of brisket. Very rich and kind of too much cheese as you could just barely taste the meat. The fried chicken was very good, but it was suppose to be spicy and wasn't.  We ordered a beer on tap, and a mead spritzer. Beer came in a can shaped glass which was fun. The spritzer was dry and refreshing but not my favorite.  Overall I think this is a place for dinner, not lunch. It's very good, and their sauces are yummy."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was a nice change of pace. The al a cart allows you to sample things in a more affordable fashion. We had fried chicken, brisket, spare ribs, potatoe salad, mac n cheese, baked beans and orange creamsicle drinks. Wasnt a fan of the potato salad or the mustard sauce. For mother's day they offer a sample of their Rose Cider and we enjoyed it. The Creamsicle drinks were delicious. The brisket was cooked to perfection, the chicken was good but the honey tobasco was very hot. The decor is different it was a downhome, laid-back and relaxed atmosphere. The waiter was very nice and answered all out questions with ease. I would go back and try different drinks and stick to the same food I had before."}
{"text":"Food: Excellent as always. The tri-tip was absolutely amazing. My go-to side is always the macaroni and cheese, and it was delicious as ever.   Service: If I could give the service a negative rating I would. Our server was absolutely awful. He had zero personality, and showed no emotion to our group. He was slow, and seemed like he would rather hang out at the bar talking to the bartender than service our table. We had four people in our group who were in from out of town, and were excited to try out the restaurant scene in Pittsburgh. I had been to Pork and Beans before and felt it would be a great choice. Unfortunately the lack of service provided a lack luster experience than even the perfect seasoning on the tri tip could not overcome. It'll be a hot minute before I return, that's for sure."}
{"text":"It was our first time there and we had a great experience.....we got a booth which was good as the alternative is sitting at long tables and virtually eating with strangers.  The brisket was fabulous and the pulled pork very good as well!  The potato salad was the only thing that we didn't care for as the potatoes were too hard.  Our waitress was awesome...Kristen (sp?) was helpful and very friendly ....we enjoy going to events in the cultural district and this will be one of our preshow favorites...."}
{"text":"This place is great. The space itself is really impressive -- much bigger than you'd think from the outside and pretty cool decor inside. Their draft selection is really good too, I think there were about 20 options including many local breweries. The food is excellent. I most recently had the fried chicken sandwich. Order the Jojo Fries, they are so good (fancy potato wedges is how I'd describe them). They have lots of sauces at the table to try. Big fan of this place, definitely would recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  BBQ is comparable to the best in Texas- Salt Lick and Franklins.  Excellent brisket and good sausage.  Excellent environment!"}
{"text":"A much needed addition to the Pittsburgh food scene. Pork and beans exceeded our expectations even on their opening night. Servers were all polite and energetic and service was fast. The food here is beyond amazing. We had beef ribs and a pulled pork sandwich. The ribs truly fell off the bone and the pulled pork had so much flavor. They have an extensive beer list and the cocktails looked quite good. We unfortunately couldn't try everything but will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My first mistake was coming way too hungry because I loaded up on the dirty fries appetizer. It was the perfect blend of fries, BBQ brisket, melted cheese and toppings.  Besides the appetizer I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac & cheese. As delicious as the sandwich and Mac & cheese was, i could barely finish it after devouring the dirty fries.   Don't spoil your appetite my friends make room for dinner."}
{"text":"So great all around. Our server, Joe, was terrific and fun from the get go. We had a party of four and ordered as much food as we could justify: tri-tip, brisket, pulled pork, pork belly, pimento cheese spread, corn fritters, mac n cheese, cuke salad, etc. All was fantastic. Bumble Fuzz cocktails and a great beer selection rounded it all out. I love the look and feel of the place and the food and service is A+"}
{"text":"I'm going middle of the road on this one because I think it has potential, but there are a lot of little annoyances that really pile up.   The good... - The food was very flavorful overall and the meat was tender enough to cut with a fork.    We sampled the brisket, the dirty fries, and the mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was a little bland, but the meal showed a lot of promise.  There isn't a really good barbeque place in town, so this fills a void.   - The portions are pretty large overall.  The place seems geared toward a family style type of ordering process, which is what I would recommend.   We paid $34 for the food part of our meal, which was more than enough for two people.  You could very easily spend 2-3 times as much depending on what you order, but there is a range of options.   - The service.  For a new restaurant, the service was decent.  It took a long time to get the check; but other than that, he was friendly and was around when needed.  I also like that they pack the leftovers for you when it's time to go.     The annoyances... - The plates are way too small.  We got a lunch tray with our food and then two tiny side plates.  No room to arrange a meal on the plate or sample the sauces.  At best, you can get a few bites of one or two things at a time on that plate.       - The seating arrangement is not awesome.  \"Our\" table, when it was ready, turned out to be a communal table up front.  I had a humongous table leg directly in front of me, so I had to sit awkwardly and was super close to the strangers on either side of me.  There was no place for my purse or jacket at all.  When our server came to fill our waters, he could barely squeeze in to reach them.  From my seat, I couldn't reach any of the sauces, silverware, paper towels, etc. without asking a stranger to pass them over.  As a result, I only tried one sauce.   - Our food was cold.  Both the brisket and mac and cheese were served lukewarm at best.  I chalk that up to the newness of the place, but it did affect my overall meal.   - So noisy.  We had to shout across the table to hear each other.   That combined with being so close to other patrons made conversation sort of awkward.  I couldn't hear the server and he couldn't hear me.  The décor is not in any way designed to knock down the noise level, so be prepared.    - Canned wine.  Now, I am a cheap wine connoisseur and can absolutely appreciate a can of wine; however, I cannot appreciate a $24 can of wine.  It was pretty decent tasting and I did appreciate that it was two glasses at once (so I didn't have to make that poor server squish in to serve me another), but I feel like you've got to have a lot of nerve to charge $24 for a can of wine.    All in all, it's another DeShantz restaurant.  Overdone and a little pretentious.  Prices on the highest end of reasonable, but with food that stands up."}
{"text":"This was extremely disappointing.  What absolute abomination of BBQ! Can anyone in Pittsburgh make even decent BBQ?!  Sides- sad! Sauces-deplorable! If you think this is an adequate representation of BBQ you have never experienced the art of slow and low. Normally I'll give a place a second chance but no mas for this unequivocal bastardized version of \"BBQ \"! #Fake BBQ!"}
{"text":"Overall, my wife and I enjoyed our experience at P&B and will certainly be back with our daughters.  The service was excellent.  We started with the deviled eggs which were the best part of the meal.  We ordered a pretty traditional BBQ platter with brisket, turkey, slaw and beans.  The brisket and the sides were good but the turkey did not have enough smoke flavor.  I lived in Texas for 10 years so my expectations were high for these smoked meats.  The BBQ sauces were tasty but a little thin.  We really liked the décor and stayed for a beer at the bar after dinner.  We enjoyed the creative cocktails and interesting beer list.  The shared sink between the men and women's restrooms is a fun idea."}
{"text":"The DeShantz Restaurant Group knows how to make a good restaurant happen. From the food, to the extremely detailed interior design; this is more than just your average restaurant experience. Pork and Beans was everything I had hoped it would be and well worth the wait!   My coworker and I arrived a little before 4 (when they open) and noticed a few others standing outside as well. I was really eyeing up the bar; so many bottles, so many pretty pink bar stools and even a long table for standing room when the bar gets full. Now that is a nice touch! Lexi and I were seated at one of the 3 long picnic tables towards the back. Each table came equip with 4 different BBQ sauces (seasonal, tangy mustard, hot and classic). The seasonal was my favorite, because it was a little more thick compared to the others. The only thing that drove me a little nuts was these BBQ sauces were in glass bottles and it got a little messy at times. But that's what the roll of paper towels is for at each of the tables. No need to ask the waitress for silverware either when you have a giant bucket at your table! I can ramble about the interior all day, but let's talk about the food!   The prices are just what I expected and pretty average for BBQ. They have quite a bit of appetizers to choose from which is always a plus. I went with the pulled pork sandwich and it was huge! One thing is for certain and the same goes for tak?, they know how to deliver flavor. The onions, fried jalapeños, pickles and cabbage topped on my pulled pork was the perfect combination. The sides do not come with your meal. They are $5 for a small and $10 for a large! My friend and I split a small mac and cheese and it was right up there with one of best mac and cheeses I have ever had. I am very eager to try the beef ribs and am already planning my next visit with my parents. The service was great, the food was great and if you are looking for a memorable dining experience, get to Pork and Beans!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there for Easter and had a wonderful lunch. Everything was super delicious although the servings were a little smaller than I expected. The brisket was off the charts delicious! They had a selection of BBQ sauces that we didn't even get to try because everything was ver well seasoned and moist."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The service was great. The atmosphere is VERY loud, so it can be difficult to have conversations with those in your party. The way seating works, it's very likely you'll be seated at a table with others (they have large tables in the middle of the room) where you'll be a couple inches from people on either side of you who are not with your party. You may be able to request a private booth (they do have a few) and these may be a bit quieter, too. Though the table was pretty narrow and we were right across from each other, it was sometimes hard to hear what was being said.   The food was wonderful and not that expensive. The main complaint I have (Bryan's was the noise) is that there are barbeque sauces on the table you share with those on one side of you and these were TERRIBLY sticky. Though I had not touched my food with my hands (the meat even came right off the bones for the spare ribs, so there was no need to get your hands dirty), my hands ended up very sticky. They give you wet wipes, but my hands shouldn't get sticky if I just want sauces and use my utensils for the food. I think this could be solved mostly by them using squirt bottles for the sauces instead of the bottles they use. Some of the sauces were REALLY runny, too, which made them difficult to pour without them spilling a bit on the bottle. I wiped it off when this happened, but it seemed that they were never wiped with a wet rag.  We'll go back, but I may pick up and open the bottles solely with paper towels next time."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh first-timer here!  Came on a little impromptu day trip to Pittsburgh after a really tough exam. So naturally, I wanted to eat all the good food and do all the fun things! My boyfriend and I decided to stop in for lunch, and mind you this was on St. Patrick's Day. The service was still great, and the quality of food was even better.   For appetizer, I would highly suggest the crab fritters. Much to my pleasant surprise, they were much bigger than I thought they'd be and had a good amount of crab meat in them. A great seafood starter to a meat-heavy meal.  I ordered the pastrami BLT. It. was. a mouthful. Take your average BLT and multiply it by 10000. The bold flavors of the pastrami with the thick cut bacon, an amazing house mayo, and toasted bread soaking up all the yummy juices from the meats. My boyfriend ordered the brisket grilled cheese. Now imagine your average childhood grilled cheese, with mounds of pulled brisket on it, oozing with cheese wiz. But not so much cheese wiz to be overwhelming, but just enough to compete with the smoky brisket flavor. Both of our sandwiches came with seasoned house potato chips. And one of the best parts, was tasting the variety of bbq sauces provided in bottles at the table. My top pick ~ the classic.  If i have ever been to meat heaven, this would be it. Leave your calorie counters at the door!  Also, check out the cool sink in the bathroom!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: The saloon/miner town vibe seems like it was designed by the same people that did Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean ride but it works. I liked the theme and enjoyed the music they played in the background. The volume was controlled although we came for lunch on a weekday so the place was nowhere near capacity. Service was friendly and efficient.  Food: I had the rib platter (not fried) which was uh-mazing. The ribs had a truly flavorful rub and must have been braised in their own juices because they were both incredibly juicy and fall-off-the-bone tender. The ribs easily held their own and didn't need sauce but trying the sauces is half the fun of BBQ. Of the 4 table sauces, the original was the most well-rounded and paired well with everything. The biggest complaint I had with the platter is that there was no option to order a half or full rack so you were stuck with a paltry 3 ribs. The potato roll was moist and soft but still just a roll and the pickled were sweet pickles which I don't care for. I ordered the mac and beans for my sides and both were good. The mac had the perfect creamy cheesy texture and wasn't a congealed mess like other places. The beans had a very smokey flavor and generous chunks of burnt ends in it but lacked some acid or sweetness to really bring everything together. My wife had the Korean pulled pork sandwich which was quite good as well. The pulled pork was moist and well-smoked. The kimchi-gochuchang sauce was also used judiciously and not overpowering. I was not a fan of the potato chips as they had a slightly styrofoam texture but my wife loved them.  Overall we had a very good experience at Pork and Beans and would gladly come back if it weren't such a pain to park here. The place could benefit from some more flexibility by letting people order bbq meats a la cart or offering combo plates so you can sample everything but I guess it's incentive to come back. Definitely worth checking this place out if you're a fan of BBQ."}
{"text":"First time at PORK AND BEANS! The service was great! Our waitress was extremely accommodating and polite! Our food came out in less then 10 minutes of ordering- CRAZY! The food was to die for! I had the pulled pork sandwich and Mac &a Cheese. He had the RIBS! Oh, and the DIRTY FRIES as an appetizer is a must have!"}
{"text":"Pork & Beans is my go-to restaurant in downtown when friends come around.  The vibe and food are both exceptional.  I have always lucked out getting seats at the bar or the communal table.  However, I recommend reservation if you know in advance you're heading there.  It's always packed and it shines in downtown in the midst of stuffy \"upscale\" dining.  I love the energy here and all the wait staffs have been great and attentive.  ..FOOD.. Order off the a la carte menu to share with your party.  They say it's about 1/2 pound of meat per person for good measure.  I tend to over-order and here are my favorites: Sausage (they have different flavors) Bone marrow Chicken (souv vide chicken in a can, with spicy sauce) Brisket (on a good day, it's so moist and delicious) Collard greens Mac and cheese  ..DRINKS.. They've got an interest list of drinks, ranging from bombs to shots to cocktails.  I like their bombs (alcohol + beer).  Their cocktails have very interesting ingredients..some did not mix well together.  Bottom line:  Pork & Beans barbecue doesn't disappoint!  Def my downtown jewel."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere and solid food.  We had the special...the boxty....talk about comfort food!  The smoke on the brisket was fantastic.  Beer selection was great."}
{"text":"Was very eager to try one of the newest Downtown dining spots, and utilizing the Yelp reservation system, was able to secure a late evening reservation, one day in advance.  Parking wasn't bad, with there being an abundance of parking garages close by. I'm a big fan of Valet, but the surrounding Valets were charging $15, far more then what's come to be a standard around the city.  The restaurant itself has a cool, rustic vibe to it with the  aromas of BBQ sauce hitting you as soon as you walk in. We were seated at a communal table near the back of the restaurant. Luckily for us we were place on the end of the table and had some open leg room to one side. Those couples seated in the middle of the table certainly had to find the space cramped, and a little invasive. You have to be prepared and ready for everyone to share in your conversation, and constantly look over at what you're eating, etc. Definitely not for everyone.  The food itself was exactly what we expected. If you're name is \"Pork and Beans\" you have to deliver on the meat, and that's what they did. Brisket cooked perfectly, with fat that melted in your mouth, mac and cheese seasoned perfectly and the pickled accompaniments set the entire platter off right.  For the price, and the quality its really worth checking out, and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The little Pork and Beans diner stays true to it's name and the food is bursting with flavor. The menu is inexpensive and simple so it's not difficult to decide what your appetite may be craving. Also they have this homemade pickle relish that is to die for! A definite recommendation!"}
{"text":"What is the hype all about?  To say we were disappointed is an understatement!  We started with a Frito Pie; salad with a few hunks of brisket and a couple of corn chip strips. Main course; brisket and pulled pork with collard greens and corn. Brisket was DRY, pulled pork was ok, certainly nothing special, even the collard greens ( usually my absolute favorite) were terrible. Actually, when our tray was cleared the greens and brisket were largely untouched. The corn was definitely the highest point of the meal.   My daughter has a gluten allergy which we stated as soon as we sat down. We of course asked what was gf and ok for her to eat. Our waitress had to go back and forth to the kitchen to inquire individually for each entree/side instead of asking  the kitchen about all of the gf options upfront. Very frustrating!  The servers that we encountered  simply served, no personality. They never even asked if our meal was ok or wondered why we sent back most of our brisket and collards.   Give all of BBQ choices in Pittsburgh I'd stay away from this one. The place was pretty much empty at 8 on a Saturday night.....no fun vibe like we expected."}
{"text":"Food/service was excellent. Celebrated a birthday and a bachelorette party. They went above and beyond and took phenomenal care of us."}
{"text":"The Online menu wasn't the same as is in the restaurant. We were told the online version is \"extremely \" out of date. The food was fine, but not much more than slightly above average.  Not planning on going back."}
{"text":"Tried the ribs and pulled pork. Pulled pork had a Mexican cumin taste to it. It was overdone and taste a lot like chicken. No coleslaw either.... blows my mind at a BBQ joint. In the end I don't think this was my style of BBQ, but the service was great. Cocktails were good but on the small side."}
{"text":"This was our second time. The restaurant is always busy and we were going before a show. Still we never felt pressed for time. I had a custom cocktail spin on gin and tonic with notched up aromatics (juniper, orange and lime) with their house-made tonic. It was great with the smoky brisket and pulled pork we chose for our blue plate special. We shared that with the pork rinds, which were surprisingly light."}
{"text":"The space is so unique! The food was great - Pork belly for the win! They have 2 rotating frozen drinks which are always very strong and delicious. They also use all house made syrups for their drinks which I appreciate! Have had multiple positive experiences with the staff at both the bar and tables! They're all very knowledgeable about the menu and bar items. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Ate here a few nights ago. Very cool spot. Reservations will get you better seating. If not you may get seated at the almost picnic style seating in the back area where they have very long tables with like 12 chairs on each side and you're sitting next to strangers. A little awkward. Food was dope though. I had 2 snacks; the deviled eggs plate and the brisket walking taco. Both were amazing and I highly recommend. The check was cheaper than anticipated also!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was very helpful explaining the portions and making recommendations. Explained that the description of the drink my fiancé ordered is misleading and not as sweet as she thought. He described some other drinks he thought she would like and she was VERY happy with his suggestion.  The portions were good, we were VERY full afterwards. The BBQ sauces were nice to have right at the table so you could use as much or as little as you like!"}
{"text":"What a great place. We came here on a Tuesday evening and we had ourselves a feast! We ordered the two meats/two sides meal per person. I got the brisket and tri-tip, and my girlfriend got the brisket and pork belly pastrami as the meats and we got the French fries, Mac n cheese x2), and potato salad as the sides.   While I still think it is a step down from Austin, Texas brisket, this is a quality cut of meat. Juicy and flavorful, I found myself savoring the experience with all five senses. The tri-tip was fine too- I would have liked mine a little less cooked, but the burnt ends were delicious. Lastly, the pork belly pastrami was a over average as well, and paired so nicely with the seasonal sauce they had which was an Asian bbq type of thing. All are served with pickles, onions and bread. The pickles are actually also worth mentioning as stand-out.   The fries were more of wedges which were ok. The Mac n cheese and potato salad were both very good- we wish we got more!   Great beer selection, aesthetics, and flavor bring this place together as a BBQ must-taste in Pittsburgh. They've got some good chefs and equipment back there, bringing some much-needed southern flavor to the northeast."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food.We had the pimento cheese, spare ribs, tri-tip and of course, mac and cheese, all were yummy. Also, they have an amazing beer list, with tons of stuff on draft."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and always had great bbq.  Great pulled pork and the sides are really good too.  The drinks were good as well and service was good.  Try the pimento cheese as an app!"}
{"text":"This place is expensive and we aren't excited about a return visit. Don't get the Hot Brown. .it's a nacho cheese disaster. The jalepeno cheese stuffed kielbasa sandwich was good!  Get the potato salad if you find yourself here."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and delicious BBQ. Took awhile for my husband to get his beer each time he ordered but we had a great time. Pork belly with jalepeno and cauliflower cream was great!"}
{"text":"This is probably my new favorite restaurant.    The pulled pork was tender and delicious, no need to add bbq sauce.  The beans were great too!  The mac & cheese paired really well with the strong flavors of the fall off the bone ribs.  The food arrived quickly (5:30 pm res on a weekday).  Drinks were a bit slow, but I really enjoyed the selection of cocktails and beers.  Everyone that worked there was smiling and friendly.  The space and decor were great, and it wasn't too loud to chat which is a rarity these days.  I took one star off for the communal seating.  We were lucky, and got there early enough to sit at the end of one, with a gap between us and the other diners due to a barrier of sauces, etc.  Others weren't so lucky.  I'm not sure I would go there during a busy time unless I had a reservation & a party of 3 or more.  If you have a party of 2, maybe try to sit at the bar if you can't get the end of a table.  The seats looked very comfy."}
{"text":"After my third visit I'm ready to go on record stating that pork and beans is one of the best restaurants in the city. I personally don't believe that good BBQ must come from a divey hole in the wall. This place is upscale, but I assure you it is delicious.   The drink menu is solid. Good, diverse list of draft beers. Some fun stuff like pickle backs, boilermakers, and slushies. A good variety of cocktails in terms of spirits and flavors.   But you're here for the meat. I believe the turkey is the best I've ever had. The tri tip is also incredible. All four sauces (one rotates seasonally) are very good. The tri tip is so good that even a sauce fan like myself does not want to taint the excellent flavor with sauce.   The sides are actually just ok. Haven't been knocked out by any of the 5 or so I've tried. The ambience is hip and the service has always been strong.   Despite the sides being average, I have to give five stars. Because the meat, man. Isn't that really what you're here for?"}
{"text":"The food, drink selections, and service were excellent. Great selection of BBQ and delicious. Celebrated my twins birthdays and everyone had a great time. Will definitely come back to this restaurant for a casual meal."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best BBQ joints I've been too. Not yo offend anyone from Pittsburgh, but this is one of the last places I thought would have great BBQ.  We ordered the ribs and pulled pork, which were delicious and perfectly seasoned. Lots of flavor. They have 4 choices of BBQ sauce to chose from at the table: Classic, Hot, Mustard, and Seasonal. We liked the Classic sauce the best.   For sides we had Mac & Cheese (which was awesome) and Burnt End Beans. Their beans are more savory (strong tomato base) than sweet, which i'm not used to, but still enjoyed.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I did not enjoy the drink I ordered. I thought i ordered a Peach Daiquiri but instead I got what looked and tasted like a lime Margarita...without ice. It was a bit strange.    Aside from that, we really enjoyed our meal at Pork & Beans and will certainly be back next time we visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A stop over on the way to OH. I missed the spareribs. They have a rotating menu. I had the chicken with Mac and Cheese. The chicken was moist and the mac and cheese was to die for. My boyfriend had the meatloaf sandwich. Great sandwich!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 9 and the restaurant was very accommodating. They suggest about one meat and one side per person. Since we didn't want leftovers we decided on 8 meats and 5 sides. We got 2 pulled pork, 2 brisket, 1 tri-tip, 1 ribs, and 2 sausage of the day for the meats and 2 mac n cheese, 1 collared greens, 1 carrot salad, and 1 potato salad for the sides. To drink, we tried their house gin & tonic, and their take on an old fashioned. The drinks (both $10) were good, but not great!   Everything was amazing. If I had to choose, I would stick with the brisket, tri tip and pulled pork. It's great to see tri tip on the menu, since I grew up eating it all the time in California. The carrot salad was phenomenal, although the portion was pretty small. The greens had amazing flavor. The mac n cheese was great because it's mac n cheese, but nothing special about it in my opinion.   I'd say the meats are fairly priced, but the sides are a bit expensive ($7 each) since the portions are so small.   FYI there is a $2.5 cake fee, per person. I thought this was a bit steep, but there's nothing you can really do about it!   Overall a great restaurant and a fun environment. I'd definitely come back and recommend it to a friend!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for unpretentious southern charm this is your the place! The menu perfectly compliments the name and decor style of this new restaurant! I passed it on a Saturday and the garage doors were open, people dined outside, and looked so happy that I had to try it last night. We were not disappointed!  We made reservations a few days before...like I said the place is new and bumpin' so you'll want to get a seat! The menu is  available online and we almost had our minds made up until we heard the specials! I posted a few pics of our dishes and everyone was extremely happy and bellies were filled! They have large portions so be ready!"}
{"text":"What a fun restaurant! The atmosphere is great and the food was delicous! We ordered Ribs, Mac & Cheese, Bar B Q Deviled Eggs, and Jalapeno Fritters and it was all soooo good!!!! Our waitress was delightful and very accommodating. The drinks were great and the wait for our food wasn't long! The meat fell off of the ribs, the Mac & Cheese was yummy, and the Jalapeno Fritters were oh so good!!!! We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"We were able to get an early reservation on a Tuesday evening, a few weeks ago. With it being our first visit, and being pretty unsure about the communal tables that I had read about in other  reviews, we specifically requested a booth if available. I really appreciated the text that I received from the host confirming that we would be seated in a booth, a few days before the reservation.  As for our experience at the restaurant--it was absolutely fantastic. Our waitress was very helpful in offering many suggestions while we tried to navigate their extensive beer list. Yet, she didn't pressure us into making decisions hastily and gave us plenty of time to comb through our many options. The food was amazing--we tried the deviled eggs of the day (crab), dirty fries, brisket, pork belly, mac n' cheese, loaded potato salad, and marinated cucumber salad. My girlfriend immediately said, \"We have to come back here, again!\" after only a few bites of the appetizers--she's never that quick to make such a emphatic judgement on a new restaurant. We decided to play it safe and just stick to the original BBQ sauce, but it was one of the best sauces I've had--and I can be quite the BBQ snob when it comes to any place but my own kitchen.  I read other reviews that said the portions were small and that the value for the price was a little bit iffy, but I definitely disagree. Sure, our bill for two was north of $80, but we left with a ton of leftovers and were very satisfied with the meal and experience--quality isn't cheap! We both would highly recommend this to anyone that loves well executed BBQ."}
{"text":"Brisket was good heard it's not the best. Fried chicken was good. Bbq chips were spicy but not mentioned on menu. Out of pulled pork so could not try"}
{"text":"The food is really good, and although our service started out bad (ignored for the first ten minutes after we were seated, ordered drinks, then watched them sit on the bar and melt for twenty minutes while our server was in the weeds) it recovered really well!  The deviled eggs and dry-rubbed wings were on point - really tasty starters. The brisket - my word - like butter - seriously. Pork belly good, but nothing could beat that brisket. Sausage of the day was just OK for me. The greens were tasty and the potato salad was also yummy but I am not sure it wasn't the broccoli salad- it was mostly broccoli and just a few potatoes. The sauces, which are out on the tables for you to add as you see fit, are nothing to write home about - underwhelming but fine.  The reason for three (probably 3.5) stars has nothing to do with the food, and only a little to do with the service - it's the atmosphere. The seating and the set-up is just plain uncomfortable. I realize it's a BBQ joint and not fine dining, but to be seated at a bar along a wall when you have reservations, so you can't even look your fellow diners in the eye, is not my idea of a night out. The tables seem to be communal, mostly, and they are wide, and it is loud, so unless you sit next to your companion you won't be able to hear them - it's a choice between hearing and seeing. I know this restaurant group tends to go for the louder, more crowded vibe, and I totally get that some folks like that - it creates a scene, and I guess enough people are ok with not having a conversation at dinner that it works. Like Tako, I would go back on a weeknight when it is less crowded - the brisket is that good."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my wife for dinner.  We were downtown for the evening looking for a place to eat whenever I noticed that I had Pork & Beans bookmarked and so we decided to give it a try.  We made reservations for 6:30 via the Yelp app and tried to waste some time but didn't do a good job of it and arrived at the restaurant at 6:10.  Thankfully they weren't busy and we were able to immediately get a table.  Pork and beans has an interesting look to it as there is a bar area in the front with a number of high top tables where we sat.  Then behind that is the dining room which is separated from the bar by a chain \"cage\" with barbed wire on top.  It's not as menacing sounding as it seems but looks odd whenever you get a glance of it.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to split a bunch of meats which we often do at BBQ places.  We ended up going with the pulled pork, pastrami pork belly and turkey for meats and then Mac and cheese and a beet salad as sides.  Our order ended up taking a while to come out which was explained away by the fact that a huge table was being served before us.  Since I worked in the restaurant industry at one point I understood how that went and my wife and I weren't in a hurry anyways.  Once it finally did make it to the table the first meat that I ended up trying was the pastrami Pork belly.  It was super tender and pretty much melted in your mouth while having a nice pastrami spice blend on it.  The next meat that I tried ended up being the turkey.  While I thought it was flavorful including having a hint of smoke, I also thought it was dry.  Oddly my wife seemed to think it was tender and moist.  Were we eating the same thing?  Haha.  Last but not least for the meats was the pulled pork which was cooked nicely and also had the smoky flavor to it.  In addition to trying all the meats plain I also tried them all with each of the four BBQ sauces that were on the table: classic, hot, tangy mustard and a seasonal.  What was surprising about the sauces was that they were fairly viscous.  Still they were all good with my favorites of the bunch being the sweet classic and also the tangy mustard.  After all I am a sucker for a good Carolina mustard based BBQ.  Surprisingly with all that I just said it wasn't the meats or the BBQ sauces that were the star of our meals and instead it was the sides.  Our beat salad had an amazing dressing on it (possibly a caramel vinaigrette?) that gave the beets some richness while also adding some acidity.  Not to be beaten the Mac and cheese was ooey gooey and quite decadent.  If you head to Pork and Beans it is the one item I would completely recommend as it was delicious.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While the space itself is hipster in what I found to be a weird sort of way, I really did enjoy the food that I had here, especially the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"The food and service were great but portion size was too small. I ordered the brisket and it came with 2 sides. The sides were bigger than the brisket which is what I was hoping to enjoy more of.  It was a Wednesday during lunch hour around xmas time. That could explain why it was so empty. Our server was quick and attentive on orders and refills. Also very polite.  Sauces were good-4 were on the table. The Mac n cheese and beans were all very good as well. The atmosphere is nice and unique in Pittsburgh. It felt like a true BBQ place with a pig designed on a huge wall just from empty cans.   I'd go back for the environment but would likely get sides and drinks and possibly eat a meal elsewhere due to the price bring slightly high for a small   Update-5/25/18 Went there for happy hour and got to sit outside in a Thursday night. Lots of good people watching and good prices on beers. I tried some sour beers and got pretty good service. Will go back for more summer hhs."}
{"text":"Great quick and easy food, here is the place to go.  Let's be clear, this isn't a 5 star, silver service sit down restaurant! It's place to grab either a quick bite or a small snack to eat while your going through the container park!  I've been here quite a few times now at various times of the week and each time I've  had a great experience.  Last time I was here I had a sliders. They came out well presented and cook all the way through. Other Times I've actually had the pork and bean cups which were quite tasty.  The custom service is great with a nice clean sit down area inside and out."}
{"text":"After much anticipation for this opening, 2 friends and I went on opening day. I will say that for opening day, there were almost little to no issues at all. I was impressed by that! I would give the food 4.5 stars and the drinks POSSIBLY a 4.  We shared the pork belly, spare ribs, and brisket along with the mac and cheese, burnt end beans, and broccoli salad. Everything was seriously delicious. We also decided to try the sandwich that was 2 pieces of fried chicken with the pork in the middle. I forget what it was called but I will say that it was WAY too salty. Which was sad because it was fried to perfection.  Now the drinks. I was kinda underwhelmed. I appreciate where they were going but the drink that I got was essentially an old fashioned with WAY too much sweetener in it. Great beer list, but honestly for $11 I was pretty disappointed in my drink.  I would ABSOLUTELY go back and try basically everything else on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch with my husband and we thought the food was fantastic. The dry rub wings are 5 star all the way - we could have made a meal of those alone and been happy. We each did 1/2lb of brisket and it was the perfect amount of fat - just enough to make it buttery and super flavorful. The brisket honestly tasted better without any of their house made sauces. They had 4 sauces - 2 were super watery, their classic wasn't nearly smokey / tangy enough, and their seasonal (butternut squash bbq) while creative, just missed the mark. We also ordered broccoli slaw which was the worst part of our meal - it was creamy and had big chunks of cheese and just not what we were expecting. Service was a tad slow for lunch but overall very friendly. I'd come back for the wings and the brisket again and again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately didn't have a great experience. At first, we were impressed by some of the decor, and all the sauces were delicious. However, came here for drinks on a Saturday after a bike ride. Got there a half hour after it opened and it was already pretty busy. We stood at the standing table and pulled chairs up, however got yelled at because chairs aren't allowed at that table. We ordered the bumble fuzz cocktail and it was so sugar and tangy, tasted like dish soap. We asked for the check and told the waitress our thought on the drink... we couldn't even drink half of it! Her response was \"if the drinks suck, at least the food is good\" and didn't do anything to rectify the situation, despite sending the drinks back all over halfway full. She still made us pay full price for the drinks and we just felt that as a new restaurant they should've tried to make our experience better. We won't be back again."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome vibe. The food was decent & priced well. Some unique featured sides like buttermilk battered potato wedges. Great beer selection as well, which would be one of the main reasons I went back! My complaint was I didn't like that they pile up the silverware on the table, as well as the cups, and it's pretty much fend for yourself on a shared picnic table with other diners. Because of the \"fend for yourself\" concept, it's also hard to track down your server, if you need anything."}
{"text":"I ordered the classic pork and beans. While I'm no baked beans expert, I felt perhaps they were undercooked.  The knock wurst was good but I felt the quantity of beans to meat ratio was tilted heavily in favor of the beans and again those were not good. Through in the value proposition at $8 and it's just not good. Even worse, is they have the gall to charge $3 for a coke.  It's not a place I would recommend..."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the flavorful dark chocolate Bacon made perfect for the palate!   Kerry's, Iron Chef, sliders are so popular that you better get there early to purchase them.  The hotdogs are made to perfection with all the right ingredients.  The Pork-Tugese tasted wonderful with one of my favorite ingredients, kale.  My nephew loved the food on the Kids Menu.  He had such a wonderful time that he can't wait to come back.  This family friendly place is definitely a must!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Richard Deshantz restaurant group, and I personally place both Butcher and the Rye and täk? in my personal top five restaurants in Pittsburgh. I was so excited to hear about this fourth restaurant concept, Pork & Beans, and made early December dinner reservations with friends to check it out.  The seating is a bit tricky in here. There is a large bar area, rows of community tables, and just a few private booths lining one side of the restaurant. Without requesting a booth, we got very lucky and were seated in one, while many other poor souls with reservations sat in the communal seating bumping elbows with strangers in the middle of the restaurant.  Like its three sibling restaurants, Pork & Beans is decorated to perfection. However, unlike its predecessors, the restaurant is quirky and whimsical in a goofy way, rather than being more trendy and serious. I really enjoyed this component. You can't help but smile when the Pimento Cheese app is served with a sleeve of Ritz crackers, a coffee can holds silverware on the table, and beer is served in a brown paper bag.   Our server was excellent as well. She was attentive without being overbearing, made great recommendations, and always had a big smile on her face.  Now to the food and drinks... We started with the Pimento Cheese and the Deviled Eggs. For our shared meats, I believe we ordered the Pulled Pork, Beef Ribs, Brisket, Tri-Tip, and Sausage which came with a pile of Hawaiian Rolls (yes, more smiles) and sides of Mac-n-Cheese and Broccoli Salad. Really, everything was very good. All of the meat was cooked to perfection and showcased a nice variety. The Mac-n-Cheese side was my personal favorite, which had a rich, thick, gooey cheese sauce. Not one item disappointed.   The drinks were seconds priority for me after all the delicious food. I had hoped to try a number of different things, but ended up being way too full. I just ordered one cocktail (I believe it was the Starter Pack which was simultaneously good yet strange) and shared a 25oz bottle of La Fin Du Monde with my girl friend (an amazing selection for all you Belgian beer lovers like us).  Now the interesting conclusion... I really liked Pork & Beans and highly recommend it whenever the restaurant comes up. However, it's not going to make its way anytime soon into my Pittsburgh top five. While Pork & Beans provides very solid food in a quirky environment, I didn't leave the restaurant with my mind blown like I do after leaving some of the other Deshantz establishments."}
{"text":"This place is not friendly to people with celiac at all. Usually bbq is gluten free because it is just smoked meat and spices, but here they spray soy sauce  (which contains gluten) on all their smoked meats. Normally I would not let this count against a place, but I made reservations and specifically noted I was gluten free and they said it would be no problem. So when we show up and I can't have anything but a few sides it was very disappointing.  The atmosphere is cool though and the bar is fun, but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This place....AMEN!!! While I will never discount the beauty that is the Korean taco at Tako or the deliciously authenticity of La Palapas but I am so happy to not be writing about a taco place! I need some variety!!!  Pork and Beans has barbecue and  darn good barbecue at that!!! I went with my coworker and his wife the other night. I wasn't very hungry but had to get something! I ordered a sausage of the day. They had a few but I ordered the kielbasa. I also couldn't help but order the mac n' cheese as well because I'm not a crazy person (debatable, I'm sure).  During the summer, we do a lot of cooking out/pot luck style dinners with friends and summer sausages are a stable for us. So a quality sausage is always something I keep an eye out for. This Kielbasa was sooo good, I really wish they would operate as a butcher shop as well. The mac n' cheese was creamy and satisfying. Some dislike a rich mac...not this girl. I have no fear of a heavy/cheesy/luscious meal! I also had the pleasure of trying the tri-tip and was not disappointed! Tender and flavorful, as expected!   I love this place for so many reasons! The vibe is great! The food is wonderful! I also am just so please to have a place serve comfort food without the fuss. i date a very picky eater and I love that he can enjoy food there, as I enjoy the ambiance and craft cocktails!!!"}
{"text":"Damn, that was some tasty BBQ. Excellent experience at Pork and Beans for me and my co-workers starting with the reservation process and continuing with the flexibility of the hostess, their selection at the bar, our service at the table, and of course, the perfectly prepared meats and sides. It rivaled anything I've had in more renowned BBQ joints across the country.  Keep doin what you're doin, ya playahs!"}
{"text":"This is amazing! We got the brisket, pulled pork, Mac n cheese, and Potato wedges. Brisket had the nice, smoky pink ring about it and was super tender. Pulled pork was very tender and combined with the sauce, it was very delicious. The potato wedges and Mac n cheese are probably top 3 of each I've ever had. Now I've traveled a lot and have tasted a lot of barbecue. I would say this is similar to Texas style barbecue. It's not the top 3 I've ever had in the US, but it's the best in Pittsburgh! Definitely top 5 though. Can't go wrong with the happy hour specials either!"}
{"text":"If I'm in town again I'm making it a mission to come back to this place! AMAZING BBQ COMFORT FOOD!  *Service was super friendly helpful and quick.  *Restaurant is set up like a yarn, super original and fun.  *Even though the place is called pork & beans they have other types of meat. I tried the ribs (which is probably by far one of the best ribs I've had in my life, melts in your mouth), and smoked tri tip and it was finger licking.  *Appetizers are huge! I tried the dirty fries and couldn't finish them! So come hungry!   *Sides are delicious and very portions are generous, I tried the corn on the cob and it came with 3 corns with a little spicy breading on top (in my opinion, it was missing something creamy or buttery so I added some cheese from the dirty fries and it was PERFECT! lol ) but that's just my fat butt   So much food ! I couldn't finish it and I'm not a shy eater lol. Amazing experience overall, definitely a must if you are in town. I don't think my hometown (DC) has anything like it so it was a cool experience."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. The staff know and are there to serve you. Be aware - everything is shareable. Food, tables, and sides are up for grabs. If you're trying to have a romantic date - be sure to ask for a booth. I would recommend the catfish sliders and pulled pork. Had the double down and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a recent visit to Pittsburgh. They were out of wings and out of brisket, which is not good with a small menu.   The pulled pork sandwich was flavorful but small and not worth $13, I have had much better.  The side mac and cheese ($6) was very good, creamy and nice crispy topping.   Service and atmosphere were fine, but overall experience was average. I wouldn't  return if I was in the area, overpriced for sub par food."}
{"text":"My husband stated that this is what they will serve when you go to heaven. The food was amazing, the service was awesome. Even if you don't have to go, check out the bathroom before you leave. Other reviewer's are right they do seat family style, but we didn't feel crowded and it's worth it to eat the food."}
{"text":"Four drinks took 40mins to be brought to our table and food was cold when it was brought out.  Note to ownership: the self entitled hip millennials you hire may look  authentic, however, their passive aggressive tone was off putting when seeking help with our service.  Won't be back. SAD!"}
{"text":"I took my family for lunch before a show and had a bit of a mixed review.  The environment (industrial) was creative but felt a bit trendy which is OK.  We all ordered different sandwiches and shared - Korean pulled pork, pork belly, brisket and fried chicken.  The cost is a bit more expensive but the sandwiches were huge.  Very heavy food and oddly, having all four at the same time, there were way more similarities than unique flavors. I would give it another shot but it would not be my first choice in the cultural district."}
{"text":"Have to give 4 stars due to the service. We ordered a few apps, corn jalapeno fritters, deviled eggs, and piggy ears. Unforntantly never received the piggy ears. The fritters were amazing. Fried to perfection perfect combo of sweet corn to jalopeno. I considered these more like hush puppies though. Deviled eggs were nothing too special. I ordered the pork belly with greens. The pork belly had the perfect ratio of meat and fat. Well worth it and liked how it was sliced and not cubed.  Like I said the service needs improved, hire more servers. The atmosphere was a take on country bbq, rustic and just like all the other resturants they own. Trust me we will be coming back. Hopefully get  those piggy ears this time."}
{"text":"Came here for good BBQ, will come back for the great service! We started off with the dirty fries, which was one of the best potato dishes I have ever had. Fried potato chunks, pork belly, onions, scallions, and jalapeños were smothered in this creamy savory BBQ/mayo/honey mustard sauce. Definitely a must order! The brisket was juicy, tender, and fatty while the steak tips were more meaty and had more of a bit to it. Both were seasoned well, and the variety of homemade sauces (classic, hot, mustard, seasonal) was a nice touch as well, although they were a bit on the watery side. The mac and cheese was also deliciously creamy, cheesy, and had a nice crunch with breadcrumbs on top. My boyfriend had first ordered the ribs, but they had run out by the time they started preparing our order. The server and a manager came out and apologized to us and offered another meat choice on the house. This was a very nice surprise and more than made up for it - we would have had no problem choosing something else and paying for it, but the fact that they offered a replacement for free showed how much they cared about good service and keeping the customer happy. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife had the smashed cucumber salad and although not knowing what to expect she said it was \"pretty good \". I had the fried ribs with two sides, burnt end beans and cream corn, also pretty good. We were the first one's in on a Saturday so I'll give the young lady the benefit of the doubt,  she could have been a little more friendly especially after we told her we were from out of town. All in all...good experience."}
{"text":"I came here while on a business trip to Pittsburgh, the food was spectacular! I had the smoked beef ribs, and dirty fries.  The beef came out on the bone and when I picked it up it fell right off the bone!!! I mean melt in your mouth smoked beef!! The service was on point and everyone was very friendly, the outdoor seating is on a small bar with stools and is heated. You can see the Pittsburgh Pirates Stadium right from the outdoor seating! Great place for BBQ for you or the the whole family !!"}
{"text":"I had 1 hour to kill before meeting a friend for dinner and decided to stop here for a drink and pre-snack since I work right around the corner. They have a pretty good happy hour menu and the ambiance is great. I got the Honey habanero drink (not the exact name) and the crab fritters (on 4$ on HH!). The crab corn fritters were so DELICIOUS! You could actually taste the crab. I felt my drink was a little too sweet and grapefruity. They also had an extensive menu."}
{"text":"Food and service is terrific.  Deviled eggs are outstanding and the beans -- ah well -- excellent. I accidentally left my credit card there and within three minutes -- called to let me know.  Only negative (at least for me) -- very loud.  Just a note --Community picnic table seating.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love BBQ, but pork and beans takes the BBQ concept to a whole new level. The space has a super unique vibe inside with various places to eat including a small outdoor patio. They have their homemade BBQ sauces out on all the tables for you to try as much or as little as you want, which was a major perk because there's not much I love more than sauce options.   We went with a large group and ordered so many things. The pigs ears and frito pie apps, and a few different meats and sides. All the meats and sides came out on a big tray and we were able to just eat family style and pass things around.   Everyone enjoyed their cocktails and I went outside of my comfort zone with a wine + coke drink on draft, and I enjoyed it as well. We left looking forward to going back! This restaurant group continues to produce awesome places!"}
{"text":"The anticipation was so worth the wait and pork and beans did not fail to amaze me. A friend and I stopped in on a Friday after work right as they opened. A small line started to form but nothing crazy. I don't think word has gotten around that it's officially open so I think we lucked out. This place is going to end up like Tako with lines every weekend and reservations 3 weeks out.  Literally everything about this place is spot on. Everything looks like it flows together and for a second you forget you are in a restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh. Everything down to the employees flannel attire and the pork and beans cans for your check was so perfect.  My friend and I both got the pulled pork sandwich with a side of Mac n cheese to share. The pulled pork sandwich is topped with house made pickles and fried jalapeños. A very interesting combination but it went together perfectly. The jalapeños weren't too overpowering to take away from the flavor of the meat. They have 4 sauces at the tables to choose from: a classic BBQ, a tangy mustard, hot sauce, and a seasonal BBQ sauce that tastes a little tangier then the classic. The Mac n cheese was also out of this world. It tasted like they smothered the smoke queso all over those shells. I also got one of the featured drinks with my meal. The easy pickens which was a frozen bourbon apple cider drink. I wish I could have stayed a few more hours to enjoy some more!  All in all, you all need to get to pork and beans ASAP. It is well worth the long wait. I'm already debating when I can go back again!"}
{"text":"Reliably good and excellent atmosphere. We've been there many times and the service can be hit or miss. The last time we were there they couldn't find and didn't seem to even check to see if there was space for us and our toddler. Wonder if we would have been seated if we didn't have a child. Something to consider if you have kids and are thinking of stopping by without a reservation."}
{"text":"Life is better with a little froze´, isn't it? Well for me it is at least and as soon as I got to Pork & Beans, sat down and saw that they had a frozen rose´ machine I was all in (side note: I was a little less in when I got the bill and saw that they were $10 a pop, goodness!). Monetary value aside, they were tasty, albeit small, they were tasty.  Ok, but enough about my fixation on that sugary alcoholic drink, lets talk about everything else. Being from Pittsburgh and living there for many years I would have never imagined a place like this popping up. No, I don't think it's an authentic BBQ experience, but does one come to Pittsburgh for a southern flare? No, when I'm home I want pierogis, so if a restaurant says it's a BBQ joint, I'm going to believe it and give it a shot.  I ordered the Rachel sandwich which of of course was their play on a traditional Rachel, but with pork. The pork was absolutely delicious. Fatty, but even the fatty pieces were amazing. Every bite was more and more delicious. At first glance I thought the sandwich was on the small side, but it ended up being just enough. Paired with their mac & cheese which was an absolute must. I was a little greedy and ordered their jo jo fries which were potato longs. In theory I love potato logs but I wasn't a huge fan of these. I asked for ranch to dip but I'm not sure I got ranch, if I did, I didn't like it. The fries definitely need to be dipped in something- maybe a BBQ sauce?  Our service was SUPER friendly. He could have sat with us, that's how many times he checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed.  Definitely hope this stays around. I would come back when I visit for sure. Next time I might skip the alcohol and go straight for the food."}
{"text":"Pork and Beans was really good! Just not as good as Union Pig & Chicken. (R.I.P.) They do sell 40's so pour a lil out for U.P.C."}
{"text":"Fun place. Looks awesome inside.. but when you think BBQ, you think lots of good food... leaving stuffed.  This is a downtown trendy place... so you pay for the atmosphere.. not the food.. Even though it was tasty.....  $14 for a brisket \"slider\" is ridiculous!  Smallest meal I've eaten for $14 dollars ever!   Still hungry... you should never leave a BBQ place hungry.."}
{"text":"Managed a chance to go to Pork & Beans a couple weeks ago for a happy hour then dinner. The drinks are interesting spins on classic drinks and some are just totally off the wall.   We decided to try a variety of items including the brisket, the pulled pork, the mac & cheese, all delicious."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Pork and beans for dinner on a Friday evening. The atmosphere was great and our waiter was awesome! We had the pimento cheese as an appetizer which was yummy! For our meal we shared brisket, pork belly, and pulled pork. They were all very good but the brisket was to die for... Melted in your mouth! Collard greens were good as well! I would recommend anyone who loves bbq to try out pork and beans!"}
{"text":"Took my two supervisors and colleagues here for dinner...I got showered with love and affection for how good it was. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Smells amazing!!!   That's about it, wait time was atrocious  Staff seamed clueless and food was edible but nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"Another hipster barbecue failure. Overpriced and over done food with excessive twists and turns.  Too bad. It's a cool place.   The meats are great. Let's get that out of the way or this wouldn't be a 3 star review. This is where it ended for me. Juicy fresh ribs and pulled pork. The ribs are small for spares and $14 for those is borderline.   BBQ is not spicy. All 4 of their sauces are too spicy. The classic (anything but) has the least. Only hipster BBQ is spicy. Never real Dixie Q.   The sides are terrible. The beans are loaded with whatever and were so salty we sent them back. Should have sent the overworked greens back too for the same offense. The slaw we got as a replacement was good except for the strange addition of raw onions that left a nasty aftertaste.   Send out beans that taste like beans and greens that taste like greens. The greens should have some mild porky flavor and a bit of vinegar. Done.   I like the pickle, cabbage and onion garnishes on the tray. Very nice.  It's all overthought."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: We did not eat!  My husband and I stopped at Pork and Beans on the way to a Pirates game this past weekend and there was a lot to like about this restaurant.   First of all, there's a bar overlooking 6th Street - so you can people watch and enjoy the weather (if it's nice out).  There was some water drippage from storms earlier in the day, but for the most part we stayed dry.    The beer list is pretty long and we each found something interesting to try.  I wouldn't say it's the best beer list out there, but there are lots of options for beer lovers of all types.  And my favorite part...maybe because I'm a nerd, is that our receipt came in a washed out can of Pork & Beans.  Bonus points!  All in all, if you're in town, give it a try!"}
{"text":"So I told myself I'd retire from BBQ after I died and went to BBQ heaven in Dallas, but I simply couldn't resist.   This feels so Pittsburgh. Ok obvious I'm in Pittsburgh, there's no mistaking that, but that same industrial feel follows you as you step into Pork & Beans. You need no further evidence than the communal sink in the bathroom. Steel city charm, love it.   As far as the food:  Corn fritters: I'm not a huge corn fritter guy, but this is the best version I've ever had, period. There's not more to add here....  Mac and cheese: this is where most fail; Pork & beans does not. Cheesy, well seasoned, good cracker crumble topping to give a nice crunch. Very satisfying indeed.   Brisket sandwich: well I was really craving a burger today so ill go with the next closest thing, the brisket sandwich. I tend to shy away from BBQ sandwiches as I feel the meat shouldn't share the spotlight, but this is a near perfect sandwich! Crunchy raw white onions alongside a pillowy soft bun, tangy brisket alongside 'sweet butter pickles'. This is like the culinary version of our government, all about checks and balances. Well except these balances actually work in my favor and don't only have it's own interest in mind. Sorry, what were we talking about again? Oh yeah, get this sandwich!   There's no perfect BBQ restaurant experience. What I find is either the meat shines or the sides shine, never really both. Best meat ever? no. Best sides ever? Not really. But this is probably as close as I have come to conquering both in one sitting, and the satisfaction meter has spoken. If I gave Pork & Beans anything less than a 4.5 overall, my stomach would call me a liar...."}
{"text":"Downgrading solely because of the price.  This trip my husband and I ordered brisket for him, pulled pork for myself with 3 sides altogether.  In addition, I admit, we ordered 2 beers and 2 glasses of wine, as well.  The total layout including tip was 90 buckaroos.  Sorry, nowhere else do we opt to dine in such a casual atmosphere, dining on comfort food for that much money.  For that threshold, I would like to be wined and dined in a much more romantic ambiance and my food presentation spectacular, as well.  At the very least, that price point would require a table for two, not a communal table with strangers and paper towels instead of cloth napkins for such a casual fare as BBQ.  (Just for the record I'm all for casual and getting to know my dining partners, just not for 90 bucks.)  Yes, the food is good.  just not gonna do it again for the price.  Too many options in Pittsburgh up for grabs, BBQ or not."}
{"text":"Had reservations at 4:30 but was there early. They seated us quickly and accommodated our party without any problems. Our server was excellent and explained the menu. The apps rocked and the food was great. Fried pimento mac and cheese!!  What's not great about that?  Will definitely go back. You won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Made reservations for light up night here at 5:45 (a little too early for my liking, but you gotta take what you can get).   We arrived just a few minutes late, while the couple we were meeting was running a bit later. We were seated despite not having the full party and decided on drinks, a DIPA for him and the Tracey Mule for me, and the jalapeño corn fritters to start. The draft list was pretty extensive and would appeal to just about any type of beer-drinker, and the mule was very tasty as well. The fritters were just okay, wish we would have went with the dirty fries.  After the rest of our group arrived, we quickly ordered. The brisket was definitely the winner of the evening; it was cooked to perfection and basically melted in your mouth. Another plus was the fact that they had gluten free dishes and modification options for my GF friend."}
{"text":"We started our meal with the dirty fries.   Have to say the burnt ends in the dirty fries are some of the best we have had.   From there we went on to have the spare ribs, brisket, and the burnt end baked beans.    The flavor for all three items was outstanding.  Neither meat item required any of the sauces supplied at the table.  The atmosphere was great.    One thing that should be mentioned is it looks like they might have a couple of different menus based on which day or time it is.   Overall would definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night. We were seated quickly and the most smiley waiter came to take our drink orders. He was super friendly and seemed so happy. We didn't get alcohol, just cokes. I was supposed to take a customer here last week but the meeting was moved up and we didn't end up coming. Boy was I glad. This is not a place for a business meeting. It is extremely loud! Good for casual dining. There was a wooden crate on the table with 4 different sauces; classic, hot, tangy mustard and a seasonal butternut squash bbq sauce. The sauces were super liquidity with the exception of classic. It was a little thicker which is what I like. However, most importantly, all sauces had good flavor. I mixed the mustard and classic together. Super yummy! We both ordered the pulled pork plate and one side. I had collard greens and my friend had loaded baked potato salad. You get a roll, onions, bread and butter pickles and small amount of cabbage slaw on the side. The pulled pork had a nice Smokey flavor, was tender and not too dry but not wet either. Pretty tasty bbq for pittsburgh. The greens were seasoned nicely with a little mustard and a little heat, not too spicy. Very flavorful! Potato salad was bomb! Must get if you try this place out. It had huge chunks of delicious bacon, cheese, green onions and celery. We couldn't eat the whole portion of the pork but everything else was gone! We were stuffed! The bill came to $20 a person and that was no alcohol just cokes. Kind of pricey for bbq once you add tip and parking in. Everything is a la carte, most sides were $6 but large enough for 2 to share.  This was a great place but because it was very loud, kind of pricey for casual bbq and really good but not quite awesome, I give it 4 stars. I would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service fastvand efficient.   Excellent beer and cocktail selections. Be aware that Sundays offer a limited menu-no sanwiches which was a tad disappointing.  Meat selections vary each day.  The colloard greens were a superb choice for a side as were the burnt end beans. Good food and drink readonably priced. Highly recommend; reservations a good idea."}
{"text":"Delicious and such a fun place to eat or have drinks. We prefer coming in and grabbing a table in the bar area over the reserved table area in the back. Great drink selection. EVERY dish we've gotten here is so good. The beer can chicken was my least favorite. Top choices- pimento cheese app, dirty jo jo fries, short ribs, and brisket. Mac and cheese too! Even friends from Texas raved about their BBQ. Will be back many times."}
{"text":"Delicious and creative American BBQ. Staff is friendly and really accommodating. Great for couples and families with kids too! Casual yet trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"We finally tried Pork and Beans after our friends kept raving about the place. We were not disappointed. The food and service were great. We sat in the picnic style seating next to two couples we didn't know but it was actually a fun setting. We got to know them a bit and enjoyed the conversation. The cocktails were a little pricey and the Moscow mule was heavy on the ginger beer but I loved how they were served in cans. We had a later reservation so they were out of some of the specials already but our food and sides were delicious. A good meal to share, the sides were pretty big. Next time we will definitely make an earlier reservation so we can try out those specials!"}
{"text":"Love it.  Had a hard time picking something as it all looked amazing but decided on the brisket. Was cooked and smoked perfect. Don't even waste putting on any bbq as it didn't need it at all.  Also you can't go wrong picking the mac n cheese either.  It was delicious. I will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"We went in after a night out. The service was good the people were friendly the food was fair at best.   We ordered the special salt and pepper chicken. It was salty....I know it's salt and pepper chicken but it should have been called salt chicken. It was prepared in such a way that the meat tasted odd almost like frozen chicken. I ordered a kale salad. It had so much dressing I sent it back. It came back with even more dressing. It was inedible. I was tired of complaining so said nothing. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This was a really great experience.  We ordered the Dad's Lawnchair and a pickle back which were both very tasty.  We also had the fritters and piggy ears which were very good.  My husband got the hot brown and I got the brisket sandwich...both were yummy and hit the spot!  I would definitely go back.  It would be a good place for a work dinner or happy hour.  Really fun!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice and love the design. Our food was fantastic.  The server was incredible.  I loved the different BBQ sauces and the portions were great size.  We will definitely be going back to try everything we didn't get on our first visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic industrial design. Menu is very pork heavy as one would expect (didn't find any beef). The beer selection is top top all right. Very atmospheric place, highly recommended for the best impression about Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service and a pretty strong margarita.  We got the baby back ribs, pastrami, mac and cheese, pig ears and carrot salad, nothing was bad and everything tasted great.  I was pretty worried about the pig ears at first but they were good.  The ribs were honestly amazing, I could have eaten those forever!"}
{"text":"Good food and decent beer options.  It gets the job done for sure if you're craving BBQ.  It seems to have the same hip spin that a lot of the restaurants owned by this owner have which isn't bad but if you want just the classic pulled pork or brisket sandwich this won't quite be what you're  looking for."}
{"text":"So I must say, I hate this new lunch room vibe I've been noticing at these new restaurants. When I go out to eat, the plan is to spend time with those I came with. I do not feel comfortable having others basically sitting on my lap listening to my conversation. The decor, from the very \"open concept\" bathroom to the caged in feel, was not for me.  The food on the other hand was quite good. The brisket was probably one of the best I've ever had, and the portions seemed generous for the price. The sauce was just okay though. I am partial to a Kansas City style sweet and thick sauce over a more vinegar based sauce; which I found Pork and Beans to have. Not terrible, just not one of my favorites. I would go back for the brisket but make sure to reserve a private booth."}
{"text":"Great food.  Smoke, make all their own meats.  Large draft selection.  Stop in and try, staff are wonderful."}
{"text":"This place in ever aspect was a HOMERUN experience for us! -the atmosphere is super cool -the service was AMAZING -the drinks were good  -the food was TO DIE FOR  I recommend if you come with 4+ people to just pick 4+ meats and a couple sides and just everyone dive in together! It was soooo yummy and we all got to basically sample everything while being completely full and satisfied! And....   GET THE DIRTY FRIES  GET THE DIRTY FRIES  GET THE DIRTY FRIES   serioisly! GET THEMMMMM!!!"}
{"text":"Yelp reservations saved the day on this one! I did a speedy search for reservations for 6 people and snagged a spot for our group after having some struggles deciding on a place to go for dinner. It was magical and I felt like technology helped save the day! We got a pretty fab meal out of it too.   The service was great - our server was on top of our drinks the whole night! I had visited a brewery earlier so I opted for Bulleit Rye on the rocks for one slow sipper to tide me over through the meal. What I didn't realize is that would end up being a rocks glass filled to the tippy top. I couldn't help but laugh when he set it down, but hey that's what vacation is for! Definitely got my money's worth on that one. Everyone else tried a bunch of beers. My bf was pumped to have some Auroch's gluten free beer too.   Since we had a decent sized group we decided a shared meal was in order and works well for the way the menu is structured. There's a list of different types of BBQ meats that come as platters and a list of sandwiches. The sandos are good for individual options and the platters naturally great for sharing. So we did just that - ribs, pulled pork, beer can chicken and brisket. The ribs were the shining star for sure - a must order! I couldn't stop going in for more, 2nd fave was the brisket. All the meats were super tender and well seasoned. The sides were amazing too - stand out was the broccoli salad (mayo based). The collard greens and Mac and cheese were solid too! We also tried the corn fritters, but they were a little to dry for me. I was saving room for protein! The platters come with a Martin's potato roll (arguably the best) along with pickles and cabbage and other accoutrements. They have a host of homemade BBQ sauces. The server was kind enough to share which ones went best with what so be sure to ask.   Overall, 3 sides and 4 meat platters was just enough to fill us up. We had an awesome time - the playlist was bumping some killer 90s tunes and the space was open and fun."}
{"text":"First time here and they did not disappoint.  Food was fantastic and service was top notch.  Very relaxed fun atmosphere.  Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Happy edition to downtown! First time was restaurant week and they had some of the most amazing ribs as a special. Three meals later and never disappointing. Great group place"}
{"text":"Very dissapointing. For the price, I thought I would get a real sandwich! $12 for a catfish sandwich was more like a slider than a sandwich. My friend got the meatloaf and is was pretty pitiful for $13. No sides, not even fries or chips. This place is charging a lot to be trendy. Definitely not a good value for what you get. Oh, if you like watered down vinegar tasting barbecue sauce, you might like this place."}
{"text":"The Container Park is NUTS on Sunday mornings.  I mean seriously, NUTS.  It's packed with kids and families and people just every where. It's chaos!  But I kinda like it. I think. My friends and I were doing a photo shoot here and decided halfway through that we were dying of starvation.  I would've elbowed babies out of the way for a taco, but the Mexican place had a line out the door and down alongside the building.  I wasn't sure I was up for elbowing THAT many babies, so we sauntered over to their neighbor, Pork & Beans.   I was extremely skeptical, as I am not a big \"beans\" fan, but my friends were uber excited and upon seeing that they had sliders, I relented.  I ordered the sliders and two sides, mac & cheese and red beans & rice.  Yes I know I just got done saying I wasn't a beans fan, but I was curious.  I also got a beer.  All of this together was about $19 - way more spendy than I would've like for lunch, but it was a lot of food, and I was STARVING.  All of my food came within 15 minutes and I will say that I was extremely impressed. The sliders were so juicy and full of flavor.  The two sides were just a perfect size, at 2 for $5 I was able to share them with two of my friends. The red beans & rice were perfectly cooked with a bit of Cajun seasoning. SO GOOD that I want to go back and eat more.  The mac & cheese was good too, nothing spectacular, but with 2 spectacular things out of 3, I was happy.   One of my friends ordered the grilled cheese and he said it was good, but it looked like a normal plain grilled cheese I'd make at home.  My other friend ordered world's best hot dog and said it was decent."}
{"text":"I honestly feel guilty giving this place 3 stars.  I have made four trips prior to writing this review, and if I had reviewed after the first two trips my rating would have been 5 stars, but the quality has gone down hill in the recent past. I've had quite a few items off of their menu, and although many of the items were super tasty and well executed, but the pulled pork these past 2 visits has been so salty that it was inedible (for me, my husband powered through it because...barbecue).  I could feel my blood pressure soaring with each bite--it was really disappointing because the pulled pork was out of this world the first two times I visited. I'll probably still be back because I love the atmosphere and their draft list is on point. Their Mac and cheese is always worth a taste and the street corn is tasty, too."}
{"text":"We had a great time in the laid back, fun and energetic venue. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helped us through the menu of vast options. We settled on loaded fries, ribs, pork belly, brisket, greens, mac & cheese, broccoli salad and the baked beans with potatoes wedges to boot.  We have few leftovers and didn't really care for the pork belly ( way too fatty even for pork belly) but enjoyed every other item. The Leonas ice cream sandwiches (which we all love) because they are local and yummy were a great way to end our meal.   Paired with Voodoo Met and a few Moscow Mules( with Titos)! Drinks were well made."}
{"text":"I have been here twice since opening and have made a point to order different things each time.   There are so many options between the menu and fun specials.  We opted to choose a few meat options and sides for our group which are delivered to your table on a big platter for everyone to enjoy. The food is truly amazing with everything smoked/barbecued/grilled (etc) to perfection.  You will not want to stop eating! The service is exceptional and the cocktails are creative and delicious.  Pork and Beans is not only serving up some of the best barbecue around but also offers an unbeatably fun vibe.  Go hungry and take your friends!"}
{"text":"Happened to walk by this place while leaving another nearby restaurant and after reading about it on Yelp, decided to make reservations and give it a shot, and I certainly was NOT disappointed.   Rustic atmosphere and decor with a modern twist that makes you feel like you're eating at an authentic BBQ joint in the Midwest. Friendly, knowledgeable staff who were able to make some great suggestions and recommendations. Extensive selection of draft beers and some awesome original cocktails on the menu as well.   The food was equally as satisfying. Everything was so tasty and full of flavor, with generous helpings that will be sure have you unbuttoning the top button of your pants by the end of the night. Each table is set with 3-4 bottles of BBQ sauce including an original and a seasonal sauce which really added to the meal.  We ordered the pulled pork, brisket and the Jo Jo fries and Mac 'n Cheese for sides and it was all amazing. The pulled pork came with slider buns and raddachio slaw which I absolutely loved. I really don't like or eat coleslaw, but the slaw at pork and beans was so flavorful and delicious.   Can't wait to come back here! Although next time, I may not eat for a full day in advance just to prepare....."}
{"text":"Overpriced, decent BBQ. Brisket was dry. Sauces were just okay. Had a really good Kielbasa sandwich and was impressed they had a Hot Brown on the menu. The serve was really, ridiculously rude. We were also in the table closest to the kitchen, furthest from the windows, and there were about 6 gnats all over our table and in the sauces. Certainly better BBQ elsewhere."}
{"text":"So let me tell you this place is pretty amazing. And as a native Californian I was very delighted that they had tri-tip on their menu. So the inside of the restaurant is done up the right way for the food their serving.   So we ordered the devil eggs of the day and they were every bit of delicious. The bacon sprinkled with the fresh piece of dill was an awesome finish.   For our main course we order the dirty fries, tri-tip, ma n cheese, and baked beans. Foremost, get items to share the amount of food served is plenty and you can try more things. The tri-tip was cooked to perfection and was so delicious. The mac n cheese was the reason I didn't give them 5 stars. It had a wonderful look and consistency however, it was bland and lacked any real flavor. The baked beans were absolutely amazing and delicious. It was by far the best part of the meal. The dirty fries were expecting great. The size of the wedges were nice and the flavor profile was amazing.   All in all good eating."}
{"text":"I really loved Pork and Beans.  The interior decor is perfect. I liked that it's more spacious than the other restaurants from this restaurant group. The bar is really neat with the sink taps, I loved the design. We had a 7pm reservation Saturday and they let us know they were running a little behind. So, we grabbed drinks at the bar while we waited. The bartenders were phenomenal, they greeted us right away and introduced themselves. They had 1911 Raspberry Cider on tap, so I was a happy camper. We were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation.  There are two types of tables in the dining area; booths along one wall and large dining tables that you share with other patrons. We were seated at one of the long tables in between two other parties. At first, I was bummed, but you really don't feel like other people are seated next to you. They do a great job of using the condiments and things as a sort of \"barrier\" between groups. I think a booth would still be ideal though.  I thought they had a lot of great options for food. More so than some of their other restaurants. Everything appeared to be fairly priced (maybe the sides are a little pricey at $7 a pop). I ordered the catfish sliders as my meal and mac-and-cheese. The food was so good! I could eat those catfish sliders regularly.   The only bad part of my meal was the service during dinner. We went from the phenomenal bartenders, to a pretty lame waiter. He wasn't personable at all and never offered to refill our drinks from the bar. In fact, when my brother finished his beer he came over and removed his glass from the table, without saying anything. I had to ask for another beer, and he asked me for my I.D. to get a new one (after I'd already had two at the bar?). But, again he never offered to grab one for anyone else even though their glasses were empty."}
{"text":"The latest and greatest installment in the Richard DeShantz restaurant group's campaign to Make Downtown Pittsburgh Great Again. I love M&P, tako, and Butcher & the Rye. But since I am downright obsessed with barbeque, Pork and Beans is my new favorite restaurant in growing culinary empire.  My partner and I had the brisket and the spare ribs. Both were tasty, but the spare ribs were To. Die. For. Seriously! A ribs lover's heaven.  We also tried the Cobb salad, which was all good except the fried chicken, which had really bland fried breading. I don't know if this was a fluke, but I don't think I'll be trying the full fried chicken dish on the basis of this!  There were four sauces for us to choose from. My favorites were the seasonal (kind of fruity, tangy when we were there in December) and the spicy.  The draft list is extensive, with nods to both local and seasonal brews. It's not a list for hop-heads though; of the ~30 beers on tap, only two or three of them were IPAs/Imperial IPAs. Personally I would love to see at least a few more IPAs available, but perhaps it's a seasonal thing and we can expect a bigger selection in warmer weather.  The cocktails were tasty. My partner had an expertly crafted Manhattan. I had the Euge, which was pretty unique combination of spicy, nutty, chocolatey, minty and citrus. I enjoyed it for the novelty and felt like I was in Pirates of the Caribbean. Next time will probably opt for a more classic cocktail though.  It doesn't seem like it's really worth it to make advance reservations, unless you can specifically request a booth style table. They will seat you at a communal table if that's what's available, and there's not a lot of elbow room at those tables. We had a reservation but were able to sit down earlier at the bar, where you can seat yourself on a first-come basis.  I can't wait to come back and try all the tasty meats!"}
{"text":"\"PGH doesn't do good brisket\"... I've reiterated a # of times in the past. I've had it around the country and my favs have been in FL and TX. However, Chefs Fuller and DeShantz nailed it here. Perfectly smoked to the juicy, tender loving brisket that brings all the boys to the yard. Plus the pulled pork, MAC, and [insert every side  n drink here] make this establishment the BBQ GOAT of the burgh, hands"}
{"text":"This is a cool restaurant that has cafeteria style/communal eating which as a dining trend, I think is kinda fun.  So the ambience is kinda loud and rustic.  The food for the most part is bought by the weight and meant to be like shared communally with your guests which kinda replicates how most people eat barbecue anyways.  The sides (beans and collards) were excellent and the vegetables in each retained a bit of \"bite\", so they still felt like vegetables and not the kind of \"cooked to nothingness\" that sometimes places default to.  They both were great. The brisket and the pork belly were bomb, so good in fact, me nor my guest even thought to put bbq sauce on.  This is real bbq with real smoke, not oven roasted and slathered with cloyingly sweet bbq.  I enjoyed this place thoroughly and he only thing stopping me from giving a fifth, is I don't throw my \"5th Star\" around unless it's like mind blowing.  Pork and Beans is great, satisfying, and a cool ambience.  Is it mind blowing?  No. But that certainly is no dig on this place.  They do it well."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. I Ordered the seasonal Moscow mule which was a sweet tea julep and my husband ordered a high life. I didnt care for my drink so we ended up switching. The list of drafts and canned drinks available provides a good variety.  The bbq meats were very good. I had the ribs lunch platter and my husband had the smoked brisket. The sauces, especially the seasonal ginger soy sauce all had great flavor. We tried the greens, potatoe salad, Mac and cheese, and burnt end beans. The greens were very flavorful and had a slight kick to them. The burnt end beans were also slightly spicy. The Mac and cheese was bland with a heavy topping of bread crumbs and the potatoe salad wasn't bad. The service was good and the prices were decent for the portions. We will come back."}
{"text":"Do you know how long I waited for the Pork and Beans restaurant to open?  A verrrryyy long time!    I kept going to the Meat and Potatoes website hoping for an update on the opening of Pork and Beans, until finally the logo and the \"Stayed Tuned\" message disappeared from the Meat and Potatoes website. ( I felt like a stalker...)  And then, finally.  Manna from heaven, I read about the grand opening in the local newspaper.  Unfortunately for me, there were no lunch hours reported. (I say this because I like to visit new restaurants during lunch for several reasons...One, I don't live near Downtown Pittsburgh and to visit a \"new\" restaurant and face possible disappointment is too much for me to bear and two, why spend a lot of money on a new restaurant and then again, be disappointed.  Better to them out during their lunch service.)  I did, however, stop by to check out the décor before leaving for home one day. (Very eclectic décor with nods to upscale country and industrial chic both in the same swathe.  I liked it a lot.)  Well, fast forward y'all!  Pork and Beans is now open for lunch!  Yippee Skippee!  I informed one half of my dynamic lunch duo that Pork and Beans is now open for lunch and we literally dropped everything to go to lunch there. (You can't make reservations for lunch, so it's first come, first served.)  I ordered one of the lunch specials (Deep Fried Smoked Pork Ribs served with seasonal potato salad and broccoli salad) and my lunch partner ordered the Grilled Smoked Meatloaf with house made pickles, white onion, fried onions, roasted shallots, tomatoes and horseradish crème.  I know there are some barbecue purists who are shaking their heads at the thought of deep fried ribs, but I'm going to ignore your shaking heads.  They were delicious and bone sucking good.  The accompanying broccoli and potato salads were also on point and provided that needed balance to the succulence of the pork.  I also love meatloaf.  Not the mystery loaf that some institutions serve to get rid of leftover whatever, but serious meatloaf that utilizes prime ingredients.  My dad's baby sister makes fabulous turkey meatloaf that I crave on a consistent basis.  This smoked meatloaf is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  This is NOT your mama's meatloaf and it will change your mind about loafs of meat moving forward.  This restaurant now has my dinner worthy seal of approval."}
{"text":"We 4l ladies who dine loved it .. The restaurant leans towards sharing ... so we did just that  From the tasty catfish sliders , dirty fries, and Cobb salad  For starters . Moving on to the spare ribs, pork belly, carrots , broccoli salad and corn .  Needless to say we had left overs .  Do not miss the Icecream sandwiches and pecan pie  You will not leave hungry ."}
{"text":"Amazing experience overall. The atmosphere was unique and the waiters were very knowledgeable. Had an amazing cocktail which the waiter suggested based on the kinds of drinks I usually order. We started with the Fritos pie which was very good but a little on the small side. The meats are served family style and there were three of us so we ordered the pulled pork and the spare ribs. AMAZING. We also ordered two sides, the mac n cheese which was very good (I'm very picky when it comes to mac n cheese) and the burnt end beans which were also great. This was plenty of food for the three of us and we left feeling happy and satisfied. Everything came quickly after being ordered which was nice but if you want to spend more than 45min to an hour at dinner I would recommend spreading out the courses. Will definitely recommend to anyone that comes to pgh."}
{"text":"Some friends and I stopped in here the other night and had a great experience!! We tried several of the menu items as well as cocktails and everything was delicious. I would particularly suggest the Smoked Corn, Beer Can Chicken and the Pork Belly were all amazing. Our server was friendly and quick as well"}
{"text":"My husband and I popped into Pork & Beans on a rainy Saturday for lunch. The restaurant was totally dead - there may have been one other table occupied. So the vibes weren't exactly jumping, but we still had a good time. I ordered a Founders All Day IPA since I didn't want to drink anything too boozy. It arrived in a 19.2 oz pounder can. That's probably a fact that should be printed on the menu somewhere. Nonetheless, I settled in with my extra large can.   The menu is much shorter for lunch than the full menu we looked at online, and some items don't really have descriptions. For example, the salads are listed as cobb, caesar, etc. with nothing else to tell you what's actually in them. To our surprise, no meats were on the lunch menu at all - it was mostly sandwiches, small plates and sides. We decided to order a handful of things to share: the cuban sandwich, poutine tater tots, burnt end beans and collard greens.   The food arrived and it was more than enough for the two of us. That said, the sandwich was surprisingly small, but delicious. I loved the collard greens as well. The poutine was a little too heavy on the cheese (never thought I'd say that about cheese!) - I found myself searching for tots with minimal toppings. The beans were solid.   Though Pork & Beans was a little different from what I expected, I still liked it a lot. I do think they should be a bit more transparent with menu descriptions, and also post the lunch menu online since it varies so much from the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Came with some friends.  Our food was good but a couple of people in our group said \"Don't think I would return.\"   Service pretty much SU_KED! Ordered the Ribs but then the waitress said they were out.  How can this place be out of ribs?  Why didn't the waitress say that when given the menu's or when first seated?   Ordered a snack and it came when we were almost done with our meal.  Why did it not come first as we requested?"}
{"text":"My experience at Pork & Beans was lovely. I found them on yelp and it was only a few blocks from my hotel. I originally was going to a fancier place for a chef's tasting menu but ended up opting for something more comforting after nursing a hangover earlier that day lol. I came in during happy hour and sat at the packed bar. There was one seat left just for me. I didn't drink for the aforementioned reason but the bartenders, excuse me, mixologists were legit. Shaking, stirring, sprinkling and garnishing their hearts out.   I ordered pork rinds, wings, and crab jalapeno fritters on happy hour; I later ordered the dirty fries because Yelp! The pork rinds, cracklins, chicharron depending on whom you ask and where they're from, were delicious. I've had some bland rinds. These were tastily seasoned and maybe even brined, because the flavor was throughout, before being dried and deep fried to puffy goodness.The wings were smoky and I ordered hot honey which made for a good combination. The fritters were hushpuppy-esque which I like so I could have done without the crab and just throw in some cheddar. All the textures of the dirty fries were awesome but honestly I was full by the time I ordered them so I packed them pretty soon after receiving them. Luckily they were delicious Monday for lunch. All the flavors: cheese, BBQ sauce, onion, jalapeno and smoky brisket had melded together (successfully making everyone in the break room jealous) and tasted great!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal at Pork and Beans. Started with a drink at the bar - nice choice of specialty cocktails and the bartenders were knowledgable and friendly. Appetizers were excellent - would get both again. Had the deviled eggs and the Pimento spread. The deviled eggs were served on pureed curried carrots - delicious! The were 4 of us and we shared 4 meat entrees and 2 sides - especially loved the sausage, tri-tip steak and the collard greens. Ended with a Leona's ice cream sandwich. Everything was excellent and can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"Be sure to wear your eating pants when dining at Pork and Beans! Everything you order will be delicious and will pair beautifully with the tears of joy that will be falling out of your eyes!   They have exceptional pork belly with a fun pastrami twist. They also have marvelous vegan options! If you like hot sauce, you will really enjoy the house made hot sauce! Their BBQ sauces are equally phenomenal. The food, service, and atmosphere really do warrant every possible superlative.   The best part is that you get high quality food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Ehhh. I like the theme of the restaurant. It was cute. I had the fish sandwich which was good. It came with Cole slaw on it and tarter. I added cheese...for an extra dollar and it comes with their chips. I asked if I could have the fries instead of the chips since their other fish dish had fries that accompanied it and the waiter said that would be no problem. The Jojo potatoes were more like thick wedges. Good but could have been cooked a little longer to have a softer texture. When it was time for the check I noticed that I was charged $6.00 for the swop out of fries instead of chips. I was not happy with that nor was I advice that it would be a charge. An added cost I would understand but a full side order charge I didn't think was rights....since I actually didn't receive the chips that technically came with it already. Over all it wasn't that bad. The martini was really good though."}
{"text":"I am indifferent about Pork and Beans.  I have been anxiously awaiting for them to open.  Even had reservations in May, to get called the week before to get cancelled and told to try a month later.  So - 5 months later when they finally opened we were happy to get reservations within a week of them opening.  Let me put a disclosure - I am not a huge BBQ person.  It's not that I dislike it - it is just not my favorite.  But I definitely wanted to give Pork and Beans a chance.  My preference would be to give them 3.8ish stars.  Here is my reasoning behind that:  1.  Communal seating.  I get it's a casual joint.  I get that they want to feed the people.  But come on!  One side was benches - so if you are in a skirt - beware!  And there is not much room to move.  2.  The placement of the silverware and BBQ sauces.  We were seated in the middle - so we had a couple on each side of us.  Had one party not left - we would have had to reach over them to get to the BBQ sauce.  While they had left - we got some and our silverware.  But at no point could we have gotten more.  The papertowels, silverware, and BBQ sauce was all blocked by a group.  Either less people per table or more accessibility to the items would be ideal.  3.  The containers the BBQ sauces are in.  First let me say - the BBQ sauces were awesome!  I loved the mustardy and seasonal ones.  However - sanitary wise - squirt bottles would be so much better.  I LOVE the bottles they are in - but when I saw a gentleman across the table from me lick his fingers, open a bottle, get sauce on his fingers, lick his fingers again.  I was done.    4.  The music was far too loud.  I love music in a restaurant. But, when the restaurant is packed, and you can still hear every single word that's playing and can't carry on a conversation with the person across the table from you - that's an issue.    I know - I am by no means - someone who could even fathom running a restaurant.  And I am also by no means saying this is not a good restaurant.  It is - the food - that I never got to - was fantastic!  I know I sound like this is a negative review - but it isn't.  It's a new restaurant working out it's kinks.  When (not if - WHEN) i got back - I will happily update my review.   I would like to give them another shot.  However, I'd try to go with 4 people and request a booth.  Even if it meant waiting longer for reservations.  The decor is pretty awesome.  I love the interior - just not the communal tables :)  Do I think you should check out Pork and Beans?  Absolutely."}
{"text":"Barbeque is not an everyday food choice.  But when you want Q...you want great Q. Lots of restaurants sell mediocre Q. But Pork and Beans sells real BBQ. The smoked Brisket and Ribs are outstanding. The sauces are tasy, the potato wedges are crispy but not greasy and their beer selection is ample. Very casual setting, fairly priced and good service. We will def return...."}
{"text":"This place has delicious BBQ and if you like the community style seating, this is place is exactly what you are looking for. There is bar seating, community tables, and a few booths lines against that wall. If you are lucky enough you can get seated in one, but even with a reservation we were seated extremely close to our neighbors. I personally wouldn't go back solely for the seating arrangements because the food certainly didn't lack flavor. Pig ears are delicious, and our waiter was friendly and gave great recommendations!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a cool place.  We were there on a Tuesday evening so it was a little quiet but I'm guessing it is packed on the weekends.  Service was great and very knowledgeable.  Best meat I've ever had!  We got four and couldn't decide which was the best!  I had a trip to Dallas the next day and similar bbq I got there was not nearly as good."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place after hearing it was finally open! Made reservations and since there were only two of us, they seated us at one of the long tables. I will admit, it is not ideal since you have other people next to you on each side so conversation can be hard.    We ordered the dirty fries, spare ribs, kielbasa, mac & cheese, and loaded potato salad. The dirty fries were AMAZING! It was really crispy potato wedges with tender chunks of brisket, cheese sauce, green onions, and jalepenos. We literally did not want to stop eating it. I think the potato wedge is what it made it for me. They were just crispy fried potato goodness. It was also a hearty portion so definitely share it.   Our main dishes came out on a sharable platter which was fine. The spare ribs portion is 6 decent sized ribs. The ribs were super tender and cooked well. They also have four sauces you can choose from on the table: classic, seasonal, tangy mustard, and hot. The classic was great on the ribs. The kielbasa was a little charred so I just put some bbq sauce on it. The meat also came with pickled onions, cabbage, and rolls.   But our favorite part were definitely the sides! The loaded potato salad was to die for with creamy chunks of potato, chunks of meat, and shredded cheddar cheese. The mac & cheese was also super rich and creamy shells with a crumbled topping.   Overall, it was a delicious meal and I know I will be back. The prices are reasonable and portions are huge. We both had leftovers to take!"}
{"text":"Do you ever go to a restaurant and you are so enchanted with the interior design that you aren't particularly upset that the food takes a long time to arrive? Rare, right? Well that was my experience with Pork and Beans. I the design of the restaurant! Kudos to the designer. Every wall is something interesting: reclaimed wood mosaic, beer can art, stacked firewood, light fixtures with reclaimed pipe...my eyes were captivated.  It gave the real feel of a roadside BBQ shack in the south.   The service was good and when the food finally arrived it was tasty. Our party sampled the house made hot dog and kielbasa along with the smoked tri-tip and brisket. The brisket was my favorite - tender, moist and well seasoned. The sides we tried included the charred carrot salad, broccoli salad, Mac and cheese, and jalapeño corn fritters. The carrot salad was interesting but I thought it needed some acid to make it pop. Broccoli salad was fine but nothing special; mac and cheese and corn fritters were the favorites. The fritters were particularly good - hot and crispy with a delicate crumb and fresh jalapeño.   We enjoyed the experience and would go back. Be aware that they seat people at Long tables so you may be elbow to elbow with strangers but it wasn't a problem for us. They do have a few private tables along one wall.   Recommended!"}
{"text":"Checked out Pork & Beans for Friday happy hour and was impressed! I especially liked the $3 \"we call its\" - a variety of craft beers all $3, but you don't know what you're going to get. I tried several beers I probably wouldn't have picked out on my own, but enjoyed very much. Really cool interior here and lots of standing area/tall tables perfect for happy hours with groups. I'll return!"}
{"text":"The pork beans are delicious, the portion is ok, whoever for the price it seems a lot for a bowl of  cut up hotdog and beans, $8.00.  There is no one in line, because the prices?   You think?"}
{"text":"Really had high expectations and I regret that.  Not bad food just ok...I'm wondering if going on St. Patrick's day had anything to do with it.  My main issue was the smoked meat did not taste smoked and was overly fatty."}
{"text":"Food is GREAT price is just right and the service oohhh the service just EXCELLENT it's only 4 hours old when I walked in and perfect operation looks like they've been there for years"}
{"text":"This place is terrific.  A buddy and I popped in last night.  Downtown has some good choices for Sun night eating as opposed to other neighborhoods with many closed.  Smaller place but with an old meat packing/butcher shop vibe with a sharp bar in front.  Food is terrific.  I've waited in long lines for similar BBQ fare in other cities known more for BBQ.  This place is on par with those for sure and we had zero wait!  Smoked dry rubbed wings with coffee spice were awesome.  My friend's brisket was terrific.  He chose a leaner cut.  I ordered this really good pork belly BLT which I guess was newer on the menu.  The sides and sauces were freaking baller.  Mac & cheese, collard greens, jojo's were excellent.  Same with all of the different BBQ sauces.  Good beers on tap and a nice bar which is where we ate.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try this restaurant since I saw it was coming soon quite awhile ago, and I am so glad I did. I really enjoyed the decor - they went for a rustic, classy redneck vibe.  There are communal tables and an area with individual tables.  The individual table area is set up with mason jar string lights and a VFW sign above it and it was fun to look at all the interesting details. We sat in the communal dining section.  I am always nervous about communal dining since you never know who you'll be sitting next to.  When we were seated there was a large man to my right, which did impose on my personal space a bit.  Luckily, they left shortly after we arrived.  The couple to our right was very friendly and we had a casual conversation with them on and off throughout the night.   My husband pointed out that the DeShantz group really likes their alcohol.  One of my favorite things about their restaurants is that they all have different focuses on their alcohols.  Pork and Beans had a pretty extensive beer selection.   As for the food - we ordered the pastrami pork belly and brisket.  They do an excellent job of making the food easy to share, which was wonderful.  The pork belly had a wonderful peppered crust, but the brisket really put it to shame.  It was so tender and a good amount of smokey flavor.  I wanted to taste their various bbq sauces, but I really felt bad ruining the brisket that way.   There are so many more things on the menu I want to test out and try that I'm sure we'll be returning.  Once again, the DeShantz Restaurant group hit it out of the park!"}
{"text":"I'm in town for work and someone said this is a must new place. They were spot on. This place is sooooo good!! The atmosphere was very cool and rustic vibe. The attention to detail was so nice. We shared 4 types of meat. Our favorite was the tri-tip followed by the brisket, turkey & pulled pork. Their sides are good as well. The collard greens are not southern style I grew up with but still really great. I just wish I lived closer to eat here more often. Dirty Fries are a must too!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place!  Cocktails are wonderful, the pork rinds and corn fritters were delicious, and the barbecue was soooo good.  Tried a half slab of ribs with a really good layer of seasoning, and the bones slid right out - very tender.  Even better was the pork belly pastrami - super tender, nice crispy herb layer, and perfectly salty.  Ended with a nice ice cream sandwich.  What a wonderful meal, I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Pork and Beans. Highlights: * Brisket - soft and tender even with the cut of a knife, no sauce needed * Spare ribs - same as the brisket * Dirty fries - very oniony but I liked it that way * BBQ bone marrow - a toasted crostini would have been perfect but dip your rolls * Classic bbq sauce * Mac and cheese * Potato salad  Some things I probably won't reorder: * Beans - after an already meat heavy meal this was filled with more meat than beans so was hard to eat * Pastrami pork belly - seemed tough and dry if not eating edges with fat * Pulled pork - was ok not my favorite * Sausage - gritty texture * Seasonal bbq sauce - I realize this changes but for our meal it was cranberry  Great beer selection and service was perfect. Bigger plates needed (or give pieces of paper for bbq as plates like they do in TX at bbq joints) versus the small plates we received and spoons.  We made reservations and sat at a booth on the side. Food is for sharing. Very wood heavy decor with pops of modernity like the bar stools. Apparently the bathroom is interesting so will need to check that out on our return visit.  As of now, they are opened 5 days a week and only offer dinner service. TBD on lunch."}
{"text":"We were greeted at the door and offered the choice to watch the game (Penguins in the Stanley Cup Final) or a table. We choose a table and our server was with us very quickly. We ordered the Pastrami Pork Belly and Fingerling Potato Salad. The pastrami was delicious as we're all four of the barbecue sauces (hot, traditional, mustard, and seasonal rhubarb).  I used the pastrami, bread, pickled cabbage and onions to make a small sandwich and my wife ate the pastrami by itself. I don't normally like potato salad but this version was really good. For dessert, we tried the S'mores which was awesome. We ordered the tri-tip to go for our son and he enjoyed every bite of it.  We would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We dined at pork and beans for the first time tonight. It was delicious and fun. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly. We had the house made charcuterie board, dirty fries, pulled pork and pork belly. We enjoyed everything. I am from Texas, and this spot felt like home! I definitely recommend this restaurant. It is unique to Pittsburgh and a most welcome addition to the dining scene. We will absolutely be back to sample the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Our table was ready when we arrived and the service overall was spot on.  My crew loved ordering 40s of beer and drinking them complete with paper bags!  Great BBQ, sides and cocktails."}
{"text":"I had high hopes this place would have some unique offerings but alas I was greatly disappointed.  My daughter got the hot dog and literally it was just a normal, store size, store tasting hotdog on a mostly stale bun.  The sliders I ordered had nice bacon but the patty was the size of a fat quarter and the bun was a shriveled mass of tasteless substance that reminded me of the rolls you get at the holiday inn express continental breakfast, except not as good.  I couldn't tell if the person taking our order was rude or just didn't care because she showed no life.     Finally, pet peeve of mine.  Don't tell me you are serving me ginger ale if it is coke mixed with sprite from the bar.  No matter what they tell you, that isn't ginger ale."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it but it was just ok.   Since it was happy hour we started with the bruschetta which was supposed to be $5 and was actually really good but we were charged full price. Im not sure but we assumed the happy hour version was probably half size and we enjoyed it so we didnt complain.  We came for the smoked meats but were pretty disappointed. The pulled pork was very average, and the brisket was decent but with a smoker at home, it did not live up to the hype. The meat didn't seem to have much smoke. The sides were ok, the beans seemed overspiced and the mac and cheese wasnt that cheesy.   We were seated at a table with other people (not a problem), but the table was uncomfortable because there is a pipe that is flush with the tabletop and runs knee height down the length of the table which was really unnecessary. It was also very loud and crowded (not a big deal either, but was noticeable).  Our waiter was not very attentive, but the food came pretty quickly. The $5 happy hour beers were worth the cost at least. We aren't planning on going back. This was the first of the group that we've tried, and still plan on trying the others, but I hope they will be better than this experience."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to the Pittsburgh barbecue scene! The 'burgh has been lacking some truly authentic barbecue, so Pork and Beans is definitely a welcome change.  The atmosphere is trendy - comparable to many of the other \"hipster\" type restaurants that have been opening lately. I noticed that a few of the art pieces came locally from Tollgate Revival in Lawrenceville, which I appreciated. The food is all it's hyped up to be. We started with three different appetizers: the Frito pie, barbecue chips, and the dirty fries. We all agreed that the dirty fries were our favorite. They came topped with pork, which was an awesome touch and definitely upped the flavor level. We then ordered the pulled pork, brisket, and grilled chicken, as well as a few sides: loaded potato salad, baked beans, and mac and cheese. The quality of the food was everything I had hoped it would be. My top recommendations out of everything we tried would be the pulled pork, loaded potato salad, and the baked beans. Everyone in our party left totally stuffed and satisfied.  Pork and Beans unfortunately still has some issues to work through on the service side. There just weren't enough servers for the extremely high volume of people. Our waitress was upbeat, but she didn't come around as often as we would have liked. Additionally, there seemed to be a disconnect between the servers and bartenders. At one point, our table ordered a round of drinks and had to wait 15 minutes to receive them. I wish I were exaggerating! For reference, we came at around 4:30 on a Saturday evening and left at around 6:30. All the staff was extremely nice, but I think they still have some kinks to work through in order to make this a full 5 star experience.   All in all, the food is truly phenomenal and worth the accolades it's received! However, the quality of service always plays a major role for me when it comes to getting the full experience at a restaurant. I'm hoping that as the weeks go on the service improves a bit, and I can return to Pork and Beans and give it the five stars I think it ultimately deserves!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of pork and beans. The barbecued meats here are unbelievable and the selection is great! The pork belly pastrami is reason enough to come here every day. I say that, of course knowing it would probably kill me if I ate that every day! It's a fun environment, very casual, with big common seating areas. I always get a great meal here."}
{"text":"Really good food, even with takeout! Specials sound creative - like deep fried \"wings\" made from rib meat that's fallen off of the bone. The space makes you feel like you're in a backyard at someone's barbecue - very laid back!   I came with a larger party with a reservation and it took a while to get our orders in since the place was packed. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to eat in, but I did get pulled pork and a small mac and cheese to go, which were ready in about 10 minutes.   The pulled pork came with all four sauces (classic, barbecue, tangy mustard, and seasonal) and two soft rolls. The mac and cheese was incredibly creamy and heavier on the béchamel sauce flavor - I really liked it. I also appreciated that the to-go container had air vents so that you don't end up with water on your food. Overall, a good experience. I'd like to go back to sit through a full meal, which I suspect would be a five-star experience!"}
{"text":"Pork and beans is my new found favorite for BBQ food. The restaurants that own by the RUT management group are always the best in Pittsburgh. And Pork and bean is not an exception, excellent sandwiches and brisket. I made a reservation on Sunday by calling. When I first saw the menu, none of the entrees come with any side, I thought I would be so hungry after my sandwich. I ordered the mac and cheese on the side. I ordered the schnitzel pork sandwich and my boyfriend got the beer can chicken. We both looooovvvve our food. We killed it and we were so full, we had to stuff ourselves to finish the mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was sooo delicious, I didn't think I'll like it because it's not the baked mac and cheese. However, YUUUM, its phenomenal! I cannot wait to try other food next time."}
{"text":"If you like value I highly suggest you eat elsewhere.  I had the pork and beans here recently and am not sure I will be back often.  With a drink it was over $12.  I could live with that if it was a great meal that left me satisfied but wow!  When I got the meal I wondered what was wrong.  It basically came in this small half-pound looking container and that was it.   I suppose the picture of it on this page is about right but KNOW it is zoomed way in to screw up your sense of scale.  A small thing of beans with a few scant slices of sausage is not enough to fill me up and not worth $12.  That said the taste was good and I like what they are going for.  Maybe I would try something else on the menu or if they ever have coupons... I have worked downtown for over a decade so I know there are better options for the discriminating consumer."}
{"text":"Five stars five stars five stars!!!! They've been open just four days and it's incredible!! I've spent several years in Texas and my boyfriend is a native; this food is as good as any barbecue you'll find there. Wow actually I'm going to say it may even be better. The beef brisket sandwich literally melts in your mouth the way it should. Topped with pickle and white onion. The Dirty Fries are breaded potato wedges topped with chunked brisket Cheese Whiz fresh jalapeños and onions. Those fries are a meal alone. Variety of BBQ sauces, my favorite being the Seasonal. The sweet taste of berries and tangy spice made for an exceptional sauce. Drank my PBR 40 right outta the paper bag. Our meal was ended with dessert from Leona's...pumpkin spice ice cream and shortbread sandwich. You guys I'm so full from this amazing meal that as I type this I swear my stomach is resting on my lap. The drink and beer menu is extensive to say the least. An entire page dedicated to beers on tap. My head is spinning from a delightful evening. I'm like a stuffed pig up in here!!! Also we were personally greeted by Tolga which was impressive. An owner taking the time out to stop by not once but twice is a plus. Our server was cute, sweet, bubbly and informative."}
{"text":"FROZÉ. I know I shouldn't start with a drink, but I just had it last night and it was everything you'd hope for on a hot summer night and more! Just remember, if you max out on your sugar count, don't order two, because at $10 a pop your second melted frozé will sit there in front of you and you'll be sad you wasted about $8 of it!   Anyway, the food here is what should really be the star, and it is! I've been here twice now. The first time I had the ribs and brisket. While the brisket was very tender and juicy, the ribs were fantastic. I would absolutely order them again. I also ordered the mac n' cheese, which I'm pretty sure is made with creamy velveeta, which I'm into. Come on, I grew up on that stuff!   The second time around I got the Kielbasa sandwich. Again, very good. I love kielbasa and it did not disappoint. It's a large sandwich with pulled pork, goat cheese and fried onion strings on top. It's a lot! Plus I ordered a side of greens and they were fantastic. Like I could eat a couple sides of those alone and still be a happy camper.   I'm not going to sit here and debate what authentic BBQ is, because I just know what tastes good, and this did! Fave sauce would have to be the original with the Carolina a close second. If you like meats, all of them, you need to get yourself here stat!"}
{"text":"Pork and Beans is probably my favorite \"new\" restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Rotating food and drink options keep it a new experience every time.   Ease of Entry: This is probably the largest negative in eating here.  They do not use NoWait like many of the other restaurants in the area.  You can book reservations online, but sometimes that is spotty.   It is a very popular spot in the city, so walk-ins are very difficult to achieve.    Atmosphere: Really cool vibes throughout.  Chain-linked fences and rustic signs put off the hidden BBQ haven/food truck ambiance.  Really clever how they made use of the materials that they did.  Each time I go, I notice a little touch that I didn't notice the time before.  They also have a very cool bar seating area that faces the street so you can people watch while you eat and drink.  Very well done.   Service: Service has always been top-notch.  Very attentive with zero complaints.  The bill is brought out in a Campbell's Soup Pork and Beans can, which is a clever touch.  Food: Everything that I have tried so far has been delicious.  My mouth is watering thinking about it.  I typically order off the specials list, so it might not be worth putting any of those items on here.  My wife has gotten the bbq pulled pork sandwich every time that we have gone and she loves it.  I don't see her trying anything else.   If the bolognese is ever on the menu when you are there, you have got to try it.   Drink: Most recently I tried a \"Mountain Squirrell\" which was a frozen mountain dew/tequila drink.  It was so damn good I didn't try anything else off the menu.  Value: The cost for some of the items seem a little higher than they should be, but I guess when you are downtown, have a great ambiance, service and food/drink options it's worth shelling out a few extra bucks for the experience."}
{"text":"Pork and Beans was excellent, even on their opening night last night.  The space is well renovated - I especially loved the beer can \"mural\" in the shape of a pig.  The front half is a bar area and the back half is tables.  Extensive and well-curated beer list.  Food was outstanding - pig ears were absolutely delicious, loved the fried chicken cobb salad, also enjoyed the side of burnt ends and beans.  The menu is over the top - which I love in a bbq spot but not the type of thing I would eat every day.  Service was great - friendly and attentive - which is a plus given how spotty service usually is in PGH."}
{"text":"I didn't order much cause we had already had dinner, but we did stop here to get some beers and some chocolate covered bacon.  They were out of sparkling wine, and Stella. (sad face) So I believe I got some Leinenkugel's Summer Shady.. I could be wrong, but it was really good either way, on tap and good price.  The chocolate covered bacon was REALLY good! 2 pieces for 4 bucks. Chocolate was a bit overwhelming but the bacon was cut pretty thick.   Interesting."}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service. Highly recommend!!  Great chili. Had the ribeye loved the smoke flavor."}
{"text":"the overriding theme in this review will be: CAN I LIVE??  this would have been my second visit to this establishment, because I really enjoyed their chili for $7. I loved putting their pickles in it the first time I ever ate there - the ONLY time I ever ate there. last night's encounter made me lose my appetite, literally.   I had a craving for said chili and said pickles. I walked over since I was downtown already. I came to this stupid, fucking container park for specifically THIS reason - to get chili and pickles. but as soon as I walk in, I'm harassed/embarrassed by two dudes standing on the patron-side of the counter. the one on the left seemed normal, and probably embarrassed, too, to be seen with his other friend on the right, who was a total douche.  I know Tony Hseih \"built this city\" so we could all \"collide\" and be friends, but sometimes I just want to order some dinner and go home. no, I don't want to have a stop-and-chat. no, I don't want to talk about my camera and what pictures I take with it. i'm glad you think my jacket is really cool, and that's lovely, but please stop talking to me. CAN I LIVE?   Clearly, I'm the coolest female walking around downtown - I dress well, have that 'New Yorker vibe' (apparently?), and ride a bicycle - but that doesn't mean you have the right to accost me, especially when I, and someone running the establishment, asks you politely - and multiple times - to leave the customer alone.  how many times do I have to ask you to stop speaking to me? why do I have to answer your questions, protector of the counter? if you already ordered, can you move aside so I can order? I guess the guy on the left assumed (incorrectly) that they were all hitting on me. he actually said, \"just so you know, we're all gay.\" to which I replied, \"okay? cool? you assume i care. why does this matter? all i want is dinner.\" my body language and overall demeanor says, \"please. stop. I don't want any attention at all, I'm just hungry.\" forgive me for 'looking cool,' but that doesn't mean I don't deserve the respect of being left alone when asked.  I actually said this, too, but no matter. sigh. to be fair, the guy behind the counter was trying to get him to stop, but no luck, either. even though he told them if he lost a customer because of them, he'd kick their ass, the douche didn't stop. I actually lost my appetite entirely because of this guy and left.   pork 'n beans: your food is good, though slightly overpriced. I know it's not your fault - you are paying astronomical rent to be in a shipping container that Tony Hseih probably got for free somewhere on the coast of Cali. and because he touched this once-meth-ridden-land with his golden dick, it is now stupid amounts of money for anyone to \"collide\" with each other. however, I was willing to pay again to eat there and be a returning customer. I know you don't choose your clientele, and I know this isn't your fault, but man, CAN I LIVE??"}
{"text":"The classic. The knockwurst did not have the mushy texture of Campbell's Frank's and Beans, the beans were still firm, all in all, fantastic. I have been back three or four times, and have yet to try anything else. Love it."}
{"text":"The brisket was some of the best that I've ever had. However, no sweet tea? With barbecue? That was a little upsetting! Also, all of the barbecue sauces were very watery, and they didn't have any Alabama style or Kentucky style barbecue that I saw. I was also a little bummed that they didn't have any vegetarian options. Yes, I know that this is barbecue, however many people are vegetarian, and we need to be inclusive of them, as well!   The atmosphere was really cool and our server was so so great!   Overall, the food was alright. Need more options for vegetarians and better barbecue sauces."}
{"text":"Prepare to make friends because it's cozy at the community table. If you're lucky, you won't have to overhear First Date Night or the overly affectionate Forever 21 couples...we just weren't that lucky. It's all part of the experience, but consider asking for a hut for more privacy. Once you've settled in with your new BFFs, it's time for the meat fest. The special Korean BBQ pork ribs were larger than life, but not my favorite take on Korean BBQ. The classic pulled pork is spot on, and you can even make sliders with the rolls + accoutrements that come with. Score! The brisket, tri-tip and housemade kielbasa also got it going on. FYI, sides are critical to delay the inevitable meat sweats. The mac 'n cheese has some crispy and spice that is everything nice. Loaded potato salad is also solid. Burnt end beans and collard greens? Disappointing. And don't forget the homemade sauces. All equally good in their own right, but the hot was a bit too runny. Lastly, if you can't find a beer or cocktail you like...you've got issues. Service was professional and fairly timely even on a busy night. Next time we'll give the bar area a whirl."}
{"text":"Our server was great. I like the atmosphere and there is a great beer selection. Food was just OK. I expected a little bit better. Overpriced.. Overall good experience"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and good food and drinks. My only \"complaint\" is that we had 7pm concert tickets and ordered our food by 6pm - nothing arrived from the kitchen until 6:40, even though the server assured us that the kitchen was aware of the need, and that the nature of the food ordered (brisket, etc.) meant that the food was essentially ready. I will go back when I can eat more leisurely. Seriously - you forget that you are in the city.  Great selection of beers and inventive menu, so definitely worth a trip back."}
{"text":"Table was ready when we arrived. We were pleased by hostess allowing us to move to a booth instead of sitting at the family style table. Music was a little loud for conversation. Food was delicious. We got the spare ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. The brisket was definitely the highlight of the meal. I would have been fine without any sides....nothing special there. Server had a great beer suggestion for me. However the server was a little scattered... forgot our waters, no ice in the waters, slow to return for check."}
{"text":"Amazing barbecue, Awesome, down-home sides, and a great beer selection. We had the brisket, which was so good it would melt in your mouth. The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. The fingerling potato salad had a nice zip to it, while still being different and unlike most standard potato salads. The service was fantastic and making our reservations was simple.   Parking is plentiful nearby, the prices were good, and it was an awesome way to spend our anniversary date--casual and pigging out on some killer food."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. We ordered drinks that were delish. My husband ordered the \"Pork & Beans\" which was huge! I ordered the Kentucky Brown which was yummy but wished there was more turkey on it. Seems like there was more bacon than turkey. Presentation of food was excellent! We will be back!"}
{"text":"It is LOUD in there. Which is normally ok but when I couldn't here the dessert options from the waitor, I ended up paying way to much for the wrong desert."}
{"text":"Eh...it's good bbq but not the best. Those that have had west TX bbq, St. Louis bbq, Carolina bbq, will enjoy but not love this."}
