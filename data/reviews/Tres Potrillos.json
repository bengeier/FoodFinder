{"text":"I've eaten here (either dine-in or carry-out) three times now.  It's fair.  The service is fair...at best.  Each carryout order was missing something or was filled incorrectly.  Sometimes, critical items, like the flour tortillas for a wrapped entree were missing.  Hard to \"wrap\" without them.  One guest had an order filled with beef rather than the chicken they ordered, and when they mentioned it, they were told that they were wrong.  Good service!  Their chips are good though.  There are lots of better Mexican restaurants around.  Go there. (but there are worse too)"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The staff was pleasant. The prices are good, as well! A nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Very unfriendly staff. Thought maybe it was just a one time deal, but came back and dealt with the same unfriendly staff."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Tres Potrillos for the first time tonight and the food was amazing. The restaurant was beautiful inside, not your typical Mexican joint, and the service was great. The waiter took the time to explain to me all of the different sauces and recommended the street tacos, which I loved. We will defenitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for lunch during a weekday.. quick service, good portions, cosy atmosphere. Lots of chips and salsa...

Not very authentic though and felt something was missing in the food flavor wise."}
{"text":"My best friend and I went here on a whim and we are glad we did.  The street tacos are delicious and the service is great."}
{"text":"A very nice place!  First, attentive and fast service.  The place was very clean and tastefully decorated.

Now - to the food!  It was great.  I particularly liked my carnitas tacos with added cheese.  Mushrooms in cheese sauce were pretty good too, even though not plentiful.  Bacon-wrapped shrimp were very fried though.  Salsa was delicious and not too runny."}
{"text":"My order was not correct and I asked to speak with a manager.  The hostess told me that the manager was busy. She said that she could take my number down.  I then called asking for a manager and the guy that answered hung up on me.  The food was cold and garbage.  What a great experience at this terrible restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent food, but very poor service. I should have known that there would be problems when the server did not appear at our table for several minutes after we were first seated. And when he did appear, he apologized for the service, saying that they had two large parties in the basement. I ordered the street tacos, but the server delivered them without toppings. When he stopped by our table several minutes later, he said he would bring the toppings. He brought them to the table--ten minutes later!  Finally, when my wife paid the bill, we were overcharged for drinks, which took another ten minutes to resolve. I will try this restaurant again because overall the food was good. Hopefully our service was the exception, not the rule."}
{"text":"I had dinner here the other night.  It was in the low teens outside,  being late December,  and I needed to warm up. 

As soon as we were seated a waiter came by and got our drink order.  I ordered a large margarita and my companion ordered water with lemon.  

The chips and salsa (chips were hot and fresh!) came out in less than a minute and so did the drinks.  I don't think I ever had my drinks come out that fast. 

The margarita was good and warmed me right up. 

After a couple minutes the waiter came back and took our order.  I ordered the 3 enchiladas dinner.  Within minutes it came out piping hot.  

The enchiladas were covered with lettuce and chopped tomatoes.  The enchiladas were a little small but quite tasty.  

At the end of the meal I was full,  warm,  and thanks to the large drink,  quite happy.  I look forward to going there again soon,  and recommend others give it a try."}
{"text":"I love this place . I come here 3 times a month. Found a groupon for it. And now we're hooked. Good service. Good food."}
{"text":"A very exceptional Mexican restaurant.  The service was attentive and polite throughout the meal.  The plating of the food was one of the things that make this place a cut above - someone in the kitchen is an artist.  Flavor was excellent in the enchiladas verdes dish that I chose."}
{"text":"An easy-to-miss location tucked behind a gas station on a very busy corner.  But the food and the service are both worth the search.  And the decor is much nicer than you would expect.  You will be greeted with a generous supply of excellent chips and salsa, which you will need while exploring the diverse menu.  The burrito selection is especially delicious.  Excellent food.  Reasonable prices.  Welcoming staff.  Comfortable decor.  Hard to beat a combination like that."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my all time favorite restaurants. Very classy and welcoming atmosphere and staff. I have so far tried multiple things on the menu and all have been exceptionally great. The table side guacamole is a must see experience! Your server will bring out a custom cart and make your guac in front of you! On the downside, there isn't much parking in their lot but there is additional parking in the buildings next door, so it isn't that big of an issue. Overall, this is probably the best authentic Mexican food short of actually being in Mexico."}
{"text":"Was here for Cinco de Mayo.. The place wasn't super busy (we were there at like 4:30, no waiting, plenty of tables). You could only order from a limited overpriced menu... The service was slow. My $8 margarita was served in a small plastic glass... And it was warm.. How can you call a margarita gross?? This one was. 
We order guacamole and she took our chip container to refill it.. We sat there with guac and no chips for at least 5 minutes. 
The fish tacos were just okay (I've had much, much better!!) waited forever for her to take our credit card. 
Do yourself a favor and eat at one of the other Mexican restaurants in town.. Don Tequilas is SO MUCH BETTER."}
{"text":"Ehhh..... There are definitely better options for Mexican food in the Medina area. The food is not spicy whatsoever, even when I requested that my meal be made extra spicy. My spouse ordered \"fried\" ice cream and was served ice cream that was rolled in corn flakes. Really? Not authentic at all."}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight for the first and last time. I live in Cleveland Heights and since Luchitas in Shaker heights closed we have been looking for a good traditional Mexican restaurant in the area. thought may this would be it. Wrong. We came in on a Friday night to be told there were no tables and would have to wait. No problem. Only thing was there were many open tables but they all needed to be cleaned. After about 5 minutes they got us a table. A server brought us chips and salsa and took our drink order. 10 minutes later we still had no drinks. A different server approached us and asked if we would like to order, I informed him as nicely as I could that we were, but would need our cocktails. He said he would check. Another 5 minutes later a different server approached with our appetizer queso Fundido, but no tortillas. I said, where are the tortilla's. He asked in broken English, Tortilla's?? I replied, should we just eat this with a spoon? He looked at me as if we were crazy, but brought some. It was a tiny portion of Queso, and 3 small tortillas. Cheese was like Velveeta.  

Our drinks finally came, a Golden and a \"premium\" margarita. Both tasted like all sour mix and as if there was no alcohol in them. I needed to use the restroom. It's a unisex bathroom of the main dining room which seemed weird to begin with. Filthy! Piss all over the floor in front of the toilet, and surprise surprise, no paper towels. 

I came back to the table and we got our food. My wife ordered the Tacos Tapitios, dry pork, some sauce on the side, a little bit of Pico.Bland.

I got the Texas Burrito. A tortilla wrapped around some Fahita style chicken and onions. some sort of tasteless red sauce on top. I'm not even sure what I ate, I only know it was tasteless and it sucked. 

I should add that this was all on Friday at 8:00 and there was hardly anyone in the place yet it was total chaos amongst the staff. Everyone was running around like their hair was on fire, lots of walking back and forth with plates confused as to where the food went. They brought our food and my order was correct, but had a completely different dish for my wife, so I had to wait for her food to come while mine got cold. At one point three servers got into  heated argument in Spanish in front of us. Crazy. I wanted place to be good, but whoa. If they are in business in 6 months it will be a miracle."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around! Huge portions for a great price! Their lunch menu is great and both lunch and dinner menus are huge. We absolutely LOVE Tres!!"}
{"text":"Went here once, was not impressed.  The staff was very friendly, but the service was slow.  The menu is large with a good selection of food and drink choices, but the food was not very tasty.  Not sure if we'll go back, or check out some of the other local places."}
{"text":"Wanting something different on our road trip, we found this place not too terribly far from I-71 between Cleveland and Akron. It's worth the little bit of a drive from the exit if you want something fast that's not fast food.  Vegetarians can find something good here!  I'm not sure about vegans though since there was a lot of cheese and cream in the sauces. The address from Yelp was wrong (but hopefully fixed now) and it is just a fit farther down the road than on Yelp's map. Google maps had it right.

We sat outside and though it is on a big road, the patio is well hidden by the plants and foliage and it was a pleasant sitting area. As other reviewers noted, the queso dip is a bit runny, but the taste is good. We did get the table side guacamole and it was yummy and fresh!  Another reviewer didn't like the chips, but I thought they were good.  We had vegetarian and seafood enchiladas as well as fish tacos. All the food came out incredibly fast and was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican restaurant. Diverse menu, friendly staff, fast service, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I went to this so called restaurant on tonight, the service and the food is terrible. I spoke to the owner/ manager , he was so ignorant, no personality, etiquette at all.My order was filled with Bell peppers, very minimum meat. After explaining to the so called manager/owner he basically said to me that the food comes prepackaged and he didn't give a damn. Well guess what, I don't give a shittttt, i stopped payment on my order with the nasty, unclean, , unprofessional treatnent.please do not waste your money or gas. I will be reporting them to the BBB.aswell."}
{"text":"Very happy with food service and atmosphere! Andres is a great server! Thanks for the fantastic dinner."}
{"text":"Quality Mexican food with great people, the servings are huge and always taste very fresh. Their dips with the free tortilla chips are great as well."}
{"text":"We were anxious to try this restaurant based upon the positive reviews we've read here.  And perhaps we just hit them on a totally \"off\" night, but, frankly, we were  both terribly disappointed with the entire experience.  To begin, after being seated at the admittedly very nice outdoor patio and being given chips and salsa by the busboy, we sat for almost 15 minutes without attention.  Finally, I motioned to a passing waitress who offered to take our drink orders even though she stressed that we weren't in her \"section.\"  An immediate and rather heated discussion ensued between her and another waitress about their policy of \"sections vs. alternating,\" and whose responsibility it was to serve us.  Drinks finally ordered on a very warm night!  When delivered, we ordered our dinners and specified we wanted guacamole brought as an appetizer.  Minutes passed, then more, then even more, and our dinners arrived...alas, no guacamole yet.  Again, I had to flag down the waitress who was rushing about and remind her about our guacamole.  She apologized and left to get it...finally dropping it unceremoniously a few minutes later as she rushed past our table.  OK...so far not so good.  Hopefully the food would overcome the inauspicious experience.  Alas...not to be.  My husband ordered soft beef tacos and specifically requested pinto beans rather than refried beans.  He got refried beans rather than pinto beans and virtually tasteless beef tacos.  I ordered the Grilled Chipotle Shrimp.  What I got was a plate of gloppy, thick, overwhelming sauce with a few shrimp drowning in it.   I tried unsuccessfully to scrape the sauce off a couple of shrimp, and finally gave up and ate only the remaining salsa, chips, and late arriving guacamole.  As for the rice we both got on our dinner plates?  Well, suffice it to say that it was inedible!  So dry, and hardened that one forkful was all either of us were able to endure.   I have never written a poor review for restaurants as I know that any establishment can have a bad night, but the combination of inattention,  poor service, inappropriate arguments between wait staff over who was supposed to be serving us, food undelivered until after flagging down the waitress, and truly poorly prepared (inedible, actually) dinners, we simply will not return."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for dinner.  We wound up getting take out due to a wiggly kid who wanted nothing less than Wendy's.  I ordered the Parillada Mix and my mom had a spicy burrito.   The food was good but a bit over priced.  The chicken and beef were really thin cuts of meat and the scallops were overcooked.  Despite all of that the meal was tasty. They also forgot to give me the flour tortillas.  My mom liked her burrito and we both agreed that we would try them again."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and I have to say this place can compete with some of the other Mexican restaurants I've been to, like Casa Del Rio and Muchos Bueno's.To start off they give you chips and salsa as a free appetizer like most other Mexican places. The salsa was tasty and zippy but the chips were kinda thin and didn't stay warm for very long. The service staff were very friendly and accommodating, my server let me chose anywhere i wanted to sit and refilled my drink as soon as it was empty. The place itself was surprisingly spacious, and the decor had an authentic feel, nothing overdone but enough to stand out. They have an outdoor patio but it was raining, I'll probably sit outside when I come back on a nice day.

I ended up ordering the pollo mole pablano, as I love the authentic taste of Mole sauce. My meal took under ten minutes to be prepared and brought out to me, pretty quick. It came with two generous slices of grilled chicken and came with rice and salsa-like salad, which added an extra kick to the meal. The chicken itself was delicious, the Mole here had a slight spice to it, not too much but enough to mix well with the sweet savory flavor. The rice seemed a bit dried out, I think they probably keep a big batch of it for serving throughout the day instead of preparing every bit fresh like other places do. 

But my complaints were only minor, the meal was made to perfection and the service was good. My meal was fourteen dollars, a fair price for a very tasty lunch. Tres Portillos stands out from other Mexican places close by. If you want great Mexican food, do check this place out."}
{"text":"The food was bland and somewhat salty and the service lacked a bit.  The server apologized at the end of our meal and let me know that they were serving a large party elsewhere in the building.  Acceptable Mexican food if you are craving it...I don't know many other places to get it in the area.  The price was reasonable and the atmosphere was very nice and somewhat elegant. I probably won't go back but it was a decent experience overall.  The ice machine in the bar is extremely loud...try to sit far away from it!"}
{"text":"Real quick review: 


Decor: **** 

Salsa: ****

Guacamole:  **** ( homemade)

Chimichanga:  *** not as deep fried and covered in cheese as I am traditionally accustomed to 

Service ** took a good 5 minutes to be greeted by a host and long lapses between drinks and ordering food.  Food came out super fast out of the kitchen though."}
{"text":"Pretty good selection of authentic style dishes: chiles rellenos, and other regional dishes.  I wished they offered more traditional bebidas...."}
{"text":"OMG. We have been searching for real Mexican food since moving back here from Houston 2 years ago. We had all but given up until we found this hidden gem!  We feel like we are back in Texas. Service was prompt and friendly and the food was stellar!  Skinny margarita was fantastic. Guacamole and queso just like we remembered. Will be back tomorrow and frequently. So very glad we found this place. Salsa and chips are sooooo good I don't have room for my dinner. Portions are generous. Angleica was so great and helpful!!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food, great service and a fun atmosphere.  This is our preferred mexican restaurant in town.  Try their Mole Poblano and Chicken Enchiladas Verdes, and some XX on tap."}
{"text":"It's good enough that I keep coming back- plate ups look good and it's much cleaner than I expected a Mexican joint to be. I still miss Charlie's Crab"}
{"text":"Wonderful margaritas, and I'm very picky. Had the fish tacos, delish but a smaller serving than I expected ( or maybe I just wanted more because they were SO good). Guacamole and queso are a great starter. Service was very attentive and friendly. Will definitely be back when I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Was good. But expected it to be better. There are many other Mexican places which can be rated better than Tres Potrillos."}
{"text":"UPDATE: manager wrote back to apologize. I appreciate that he took ownership of the mistakes.  

Below average bland food and untrained staff.
I ordered a vegetarian burrito last week. It was bland with no seasoning in it. Some pieces of squash were a mush and some were nearly raw.
But it came with a surprise - pieces of meat.
I called to let them know, and the manager apologized and offered a complimentary veg burrito next time.
3 days later I went to claim my comp. burrito. This time I reminded them about no meat.
THOSE GUYS AGAIN PUT MEAT IN IT.
Maybe they just don't understand A simple request.
If you can't comprehend that a veg burrito with \"no meat\" instructions actually means no meat, then really do something else. Not sure if the person who took the order messed it up or the person who made the food.
Needless to say that I am not going there again even though it is just down the street.
I recommend that everyone check their meals to see that you for what you ordered.
I hope a responsible person from this place reads this review. Because complaining at the restaurant obviously does not work."}
{"text":"Salsa was outstanding. The house tastes like they just squeezed tomatoes. I asked for something with a bit more hooch and they brought out a tomatillo salsa that was perfect. The waiter soda they have a habanero that's off the charts, but this was hot enough. 

They've got a rather large patio with no smoking, mostly covered. The dinning room has some of the traditional Mexican tchotchke, but doesn't overdo it.

The service was fast and the food was good. I had the Tres Portillos Special Steak. A grilled ribeye with grilled peppers, onions, mushrooms and tomatoes. When I go to a Mexican restaurant and order a steak, it's not about the meat. More about the veggies, and they did not disappoint. In lieu of rice and beans, they brought me a second helping of veggies. I was trying to eat healthy, but I think they grilled them on a stick of butter. I don't care, they were outstanding. 

The wife had Enchiladas De Camaroned, with shrimp, and the daughter had Enchiladas Vegetarian. Everyone was happy and no one walked away hungry."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. It seems it has gotten better over the past year. Hadn't been in a while and stopped in two times in the last week. The second time because the first time was so good. Keep up the great work in improvements in quality of service and food as you have. We will be back."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!! The food is good, the prices are right, my margarita was strong as hell and my big bear of a husband left here feeling FULL! Plus there's a small party room in the basement.  This place is hard to find- it's tucked behind a BP gas station - but it is SO worth the effort!"}
{"text":"The food is fine, but they have a serious problem with service if you show up after 2 p.m. when your waiter is likely to forget about you so he can eat his own lunch and chew the fat with the other staff. My husband had to go get us a box for leftovers himself and we never got a check. We went up to pay and when waiter was summoned, he acted confused about where our check was. Also, he never checked on us to refill our water. Maybe it was his first day...."}
{"text":"I got the potrillos enchiladas which were pretty good, a little different but I enjoyed the spinach cream sauce. My boyfriend got the shrimp tacos which were good as well but the chipotle sauce was a little overwhelming. The rice wasn't too impressive. Nice patio (I'd recommend sunset before all the bugs are out at night lol). Good service. Nothing really stood out to me but all in all it was decent."}
{"text":"The carnitas tapatillas are amazing.  I love this place.  The salsa is spicy. And the server was HOT!"}
{"text":"My first time had the Fajitas Supreme (beef, chicken, shrimp) with rice and fried beans. I had so much food, brought home leftovers.  My Friend had the Burrito Supreme, and finished it! Had the Sangria, excellent!  Waiter was great.  Will definitely go back and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"For a Mexican restaurant, the decor is nice.  The salsa and queso were really good.  My chicken fajitas were just okay...kinda weird flavor.  The rice and beans were disappointing...rice was oily and beans were nothing special.  Service was TOO fast...my fajitas literally arrived 5 min after I ordered them, but my friend's carnitas tacos didn't arrive for 15 minutes.  There are way better Mexican places food-wise in and around Cleveland but if it's great decor and mediocre food you seek, then by all means go there."}
{"text":"Tres Potrillos  is the best spot in Beachwood. The food is excellent and the servers are friendly, quick and attentive. Anytime I try another Mexican restaurant I end up comparing it to Tres. Great patio in the summer too!"}
{"text":"Tres Potrillos is our favorite Mexican restaurant. Seated immediately, pleasant friendly staff, scrumptious food, good pour on the margaritas.  Superb!"}
{"text":"Probably more just ok.  But was in a meeting room in the basement..... Need to go again when it's just the family and check it out.  Drinks are great.  Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I love guac.  The guac sampler, was so so. It was basically guac sprinkled with corn and guac with queso. The entrees are huge. The fajita was plentiful, but a little bland. I took the leftovers home and made a frittata for Breakfast with it. It's served w salad, refried beans and yellow rice and two tortillas. I re vamped the tortillas with sugar and cinnamon in a hot skillet. All this for $13 for the entree. Good deal. Great service too!"}
{"text":"This place was like a dream great food nice xlean place. There tacos were bomb and the waiter ruben was a great waiter made me feel at home. Enjoy your food here"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.

Food is  mediocre at best; but decent in terms of its location and \"authenticity\" for Cleveland.

Moving recently from Los Angeles and using that as a barometer, I would say I definitely know what a good taco is.

I ordered a trio of street tacos @ 13$. Served with cilantro and onion and blazing hot tomatillo sauce. Where is the crema? Cojita or queso fresco? Or how about a lime wedge? At more than 4$ a taco definitely Spartan in terms of components and thus flavor. I've had better tacos from drive thru.

Barbacoa- good flavor, best of the three.

Carnitas- oven roasted pork with zero seasoning and not cooked enough to be tender. Obviously was not roasted in a marinade of any sort

Pollo- was supposed to be shredded but came out also in heavy chunks. Here it was seasoned too heavily with salt. Careless

Add to that a waiter who says they don't mix and match tacos then changes his tune after I say I don't want to order anything ....tortilla chips cooked a a fryer that tasted like the oil hadn't been changed in months . If you're a legit \"Mexicano\" Restuarant surely you can get this right!

Overall pretty poor but with the lack of good Mexican restaurants in the area; understand why people think this place is great. They don't have a clue."}
{"text":"Great location in Beachwod.  Lots of parking.  Fresh, authentic Mexican food that's consistently excellent. Servers are friendly and super efficient.  The patio is great in the summer.  Interior décor is traditional and tasteful.  This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the Cleveland area.  We're never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Fast and attentive.  Food is fresh and tasty. Had the Queso Fundido and El Chavo for lunch. Both were great!"}
{"text":"After visiting for a SECOND time - we HAD to revise our original review.  The service, atmosphere, and THE FOOD - all WONDERFUL and we can't wait to go back.  Brought home the rest of our meals (my husband and I) and ate more in the late evening (right out of the fridge) and the rest for breakfast - cold and still DELICIOUS !!!!  Didn't have room for dessert - but we'll try the flan next time.  WE are so happy to revise our original review of only 2 stars - to 5 stars!  Recommend the Fajitas and the Flautas.  ALL GOOD!!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Parma from NJ and work in Beachwood. So far, Tres Porttrillos is some of the best food I have had. The food is delicious and there is great service. The chipotle soup in amazing and so is the enchiladas and quesadillas. The environment and the atmosphere are warm and welcoming and it is a great place to get lunch and dinner. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We were here for Cinco de Mayo, and arrived around 8:20pm. The wait was about 25 minutes and then once we were seated, it took another 20 minutes to get drinks and chips delivered. Entrees arrived 50 minutes after we ordered. Food was ok - nothing special. Clearly they were overwhelmed and probably short handed. We'll probably find another option next time we want Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food was fair but came out hot and fast. Lunch portion was smaller than expected. Our waitress never came back to check on us once until she brought the check. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Many mexican american places are hit or miss. This place is definitely in the hit category. Service was freindly and quick (I was in and out for lunch in 25 minutes) and the food was decent. Now we are not talking 5 star food, but for the $7 price tag I felt I got a bargain. Was expecting to spend $10-12 for the quality and amount of food I got. So I add the extra into the tip. 

If I am in town again I shall return."}
{"text":"Drinks are weak as can be and expensive. Food is ok but also not worth the price either. Service is not good. Waiting on drinks for 15 minutes is crazy. Overall id give it half a star. I kick myself for going back since this last trip was probably the 4th time and last ill go. Dinner and a couple drinks shouldn't cost $72. Only"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with this establishment; the food was fresh, well made and really flavorful. The service was great, the people working there were really thoughtful and attentive and I felt very welcome. 

One of the funny bits about this place is that's it's far off the road, back a bit behind a gas station, so you'd miss it if you weren't looking for it. They do have lunch specials and I have to say, that with all we got it was very reasonable. The also have larger party rooms downstairs for bigger gatherings. 

The parking lot is a fair size, so you shouldn't have any problems with parking.

So, for a great dining experience with a south of the border flavor, give Tres Portrillos a try:)"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 to go meals from here on January 29th and it was one of the worst Mexican food experiences I have ever had. My enchiladas were literally dried chicken wrapped in a tortilla and topped very lightly with the spinach sauce. the entire meal was ice cold and we live 5 minutes away. My husband ordered the chicken quesadilla and was equally unimpressed and neither one of us finished.  I picked up happy meals before ordering from McDonalds for my kids and we finished their meals for them. The only good part of the whole meal was the chips and salsa. I Immediately contacted the company and they have yet to contact me back. Such a shame as I rated this place 5 stars when they first opened."}
{"text":"Great prices, great food quality and quantity. Always friendly staff. Very accommodating. Will be back again and again! Pricing is awesome at lunchtime."}
{"text":"The food and service here is actually better than 3 stars BUT there is a staff member who consistently pesters single women dining here with requests for their phone numbers and dates. At first it's flattering but since he doesn't take no, I'm married and not interested for an answer it quickly becomes uncomfortable for guests.

Lunch is great with lots of options - this is a great restaurant and the food tastes wonderful."}
{"text":"Excellent place and needless to say the food and the drink selections are amazing. The atmosphere is great. Luv the fajitas. Everyone is very friendly and attends to you. Enjoy going there each time. Would highly recommend this place !!

{"text":"Great food, service, and ambiance! We sat out on the patio tonight and had a fantastic meal. Good chips and salsa to start with. We didn't get the tableside guacamole, but the adjacent table did and it looked great.... 2 fresh avocados with your choice of additions seemed like a great deal for $6. Margarita with sangria was very good. Dinner was great with left overs for tomorrow! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"wow! really nice place to fine outside Chicago for Mexican food.....
  stayed in ohio for 2 days and ate ther both days, mmmmmmmmm.
    thanks for the awesome food !!!!!!! steve k"}
{"text":"First time time at the location based on the reviews. The food was okay and didn't taste to be authentic Mexican food. The margaritas tasted more of water with a little strawberry flavoring with no alcohol whatsoever. Since this restaurant was close to our hotel I may be back."}
{"text":"We walked in and were greeted right away. We sat at the bar which was nice, clean and inviting. 
The bartender was nice and quick. He checked on us several times which was nice. 
The salsa and chips were very good. The chips were perfect and the salsa had the right amount of heat.
We ordered chicken flautas and my soon to be hubby ordered the street tacos. Both were very good. The re fried beans were also very good! 
The restrooms were clean and tidy. 

We would definitely come back here again! 

Thanks Tres Potrillos!"}
{"text":"Cool place! Typical authentic Mexican food. Margaritas were great! They were pretty busy tonight (Saturday), but we found a spot at the bar. Kind of pricey....2 margaritas and 2 meals put us at $36 before tip. I'll probably go here again, but probably only for a happy hour."}
{"text":"Ate here on Valentine's day. Food was excellent. Service was excellent. Will go back."}
{"text":"Tres Potrillos is great! This area SORELY needed a good Mexican restaurant, and Tres Potrillos is a new favorite spot of my fiance and me.

The location is a bit odd, with the restaurant basically sharing a parking lot with a gas station, but the interior is nice, and roomy. The food is good, the menu is huge, the service is friendly, and when they messed up something about my order on our second visit they brought a regular sized order of guacamole to make up for it. 

Also, there is a happy hour from 9-close."}
{"text":"Allow me to begin by saying I love Mexican food.  Love. It.  That said, my opinion is based on lots of visits to Mexican restaurants.

The service was great.  I was seated quickly, my water and chips/salsa arrived almost immediately, and my food arrived less than 5 minutes after I ordered it.  The salsa was so spicy I couldn't eat it, but the chips were good (and warm!)

The food was meh.  It wasn't bad, but it was far from good.  Bland is the best word I can think to use; there really wasn't much flavor to anything.  Additionally, the portions were tiny, easily the smallest amount of food I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant.  I ordered the one enchilada (chicken) and one hard taco (beef) lunch special, which came with fried beans and rice.  The plate was three-fourths covered in beans and rice, leaving just enough room for the tiny enchilada, and the taco placed on top of the rice.  There was hardly any cheese on my taco, enchilada or beans.  The taco was full of lettuce, with a tiny amount of beef.  It absolutely was NOT worth the money I paid for my lunch \"special.\"  Honestly, you'd get more food going to Taco Bell and ordering a taco, and a beef enchirito  Plus it's way cheaper, and would taste better, too.

Two stars since it wasn't horrible food, and the service was excellent.  For people who can't handle spicy food, or don't like food with flavor, this is the perfect place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I have patronized this restaurant since its opening. This is by far the best Mexican food in the Cleveland/Akron area. The service is excellent the food is delicious and the selection of tequila is top shelf.  I visit regularly with my family, my friends, and my employees. I have never patronized a restaurant with this kind of regularity like I do this one.  The food and the staff are what makes the difference in this locally owned family chain.  Don't wait come today!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food and Atmosphere. They make the guacamole table side, which means every batch is different.  I've had a few us ripe chunks of avocado there.  I really like the seafood options they have here, the scallops were large and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. My first experience was awesome. The second was horrible. Our service was so bad. The food was good which is why I gave one star, but I don't know if I will be returning."}
{"text":"This was the best place I ate while staying at my parent's for a week. First off, I didn't expect the place to be so nice, but it has an awesome patio with a great fountain that makes you feel like you're somewhere else. The inside has these cool chairs made from barrels (and they're comfortable). 

Staff was friendly and efficient as you would expect from most Mexican restaurants. 

The chips and salsa were good. Salsa was fresh. This place specializes in burritos and enchiladas, but has a full menu of the usual suspects too. The 3 guys got burritos, 2 of which I tried, and they were REALLY yummy. Expect to walk out of there stuffed if you get a burrito. I got the enchiladas verdes with chicken (the waitress recommended the chicken) and it was REALLY good too. The chicken was particularly excellent and flavorful and the verde sauce was good too! Sides were nothing out of the ordinary. 

Prices were excellent, not may items exceed $10. I would love to go again for margaritas on the patio!!"}
{"text":"Myself and two friends went to Tres Potrillos Friday 10/17/14 for lunch. We chose this restaurant after finding a $1. taco special ad in the Medina town Money Saver magazine.  The ad reads, \"Celebrate National Taco Day All Month with $1. Crunchy Tacos! During the Month of October.\" There is NO indication of specific days and the ad clearly indicates is \"ALL MONTH\". We were told that the special was only on Thursday and the manager would not honor the ad for us. We decided to order other food since we were already there which I am sure others are doing. I consider it a \"bait and switch\" false advertising to get customers in the door.  Aside of this issue, the service was then less than desirable as they switched servers on us twice then sent the manager to deliver our bill. The restaurant was not busy yet service was slow and we were only checked on once after receiving our food."}
{"text":"Tres Portrillos, what happened? After a previous splendid meal, tonight was a severe disappointment. Ordered burrito Azteca. Initially, not bad! But...but, as it lost temperature, it lost flavor. The received beans... got worse! The rice... not so good to begin with... but got worse. Not quite ready to give up on them, but if there is a next time, it will be inside.

After my review, I received an email. I will say that I am deeply impressed and heartily grateful. Mr. Paul and Mr. Martinez, my wife and I have eaten at many high-end restaurants where even after flopping on an over $ 200.00 meal, never found the time or class to say \"Sorry!\" Examples being Prime Rib in Washington DC and David Burke Steak House in Chicago. I am really blown away by your taking of your valuable time. That speaks volumes and screams \"A classy operation. Thank you and we'll see you again real soon!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Margaritas are delicious, food is tasty and plentiful
Our group of 10 was seated promptly. Our waitress Sandy was great. We will be back."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor patio and the service is second to none... Food is decent; I recommended the Chicago burrito!!!"}
{"text":"This was probably more of a 3.5, not quite a 4 due to the restaurant being short staffed.  This was my first time visiting Tres Potrillos and I had been a bit hesitant based on the so-so reviews.   The food was actually pretty tasty and the portions were generous.  My husband, daughter and myself visited the day before Labor Day, not many customers, but it also seemed the restaurant was short staffed.  We were seated, and then there was a bit of a wait to take our orders, and it was hard to get the server's attention for refills on Salsa, extra condiments etc.  I ordered a dish that included chunks of tender, juicy, well seasoned pork, with a side of rice,, beans etc. and a side of tortillas.  The portion was huge and the dish was quite tasty!  My husband had the chicken quesadilla and my daughter had a burrito, which they both enjoyed.  We also ordered a pitcher of margaritas ($19), which was much larger than most restaurants.  3 full meals and a pitcher of margaritas, $64, not bad at all.  I will definitely return hoping that staffing will be at appropriate level."}
{"text":"Ok so the atmosphere is very nice and high back leather seats make for a really nice touch.

The experience was mostly good so I will start with the negative and end on a positive note.

Negative:

Unlike most Mexican restaurants I did not receive any Salsa and chips when seated. They were in fact offered after my food arrived and it was not even my waiter that offered. One might think this is 'just how they do it' however I noticed all other tables had received Salsa and chips moments after being seated. These folks were in other sections (3 tables to be exact) and I was my waiters only table initially. When I got my food he received another guest.  Not the end of the world or anything.

The second issue; again not a big deal is that with my chimichanga I asked for no guacamole and extra sour cream. I got lots of guacamole and next to no sour cream. I did not see my waiter again until I was done eating so I went without.


As for the positive;

As I said the atmosphere was nice. Low lighting and good quality furniture made this place cozy and warm.

My chimichanga was lightly fried just right and the beef tips were tender and flavorful. I had an appetizer of melted cheese to dip tortilla in and this had the option of Chorizo or mushrooms. I went with the mushrooms and it was very good.

Will I go back? Probably but not tomorrow or anything. The food was GOOD but nothing I would call notable. three stars for the service and maybe 3.5 stars for the food. Nothing wrong with it but nothing outstanding either."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Ambiance is really nice with great furniture and decor. Service was good at first but definitely slowed as the night went on and they got busier. As for the food, I had the fajita nachos. The queso is tremendous however the meat and veggies were cold and dry. In addition the chips were ok but somewhat on the stale side. Really disappointed because this place is so close to being really great but are held back by such avoidable errors."}
{"text":"I went for lunch during the week. Service was fast and friendly. Food came out relatively fast. I opted for a create your own combo with a cheese chile rellenos and a beef burrito. This came with refried beans and rice.The meal was tasty but typical. Nothing exceptional.  I wish the cheese would have been melted more in my chile rellenos. I did like the fact that you could get your chile rellenos with various fillings besides just cheese. They also offered table side guacomole. I would return."}
{"text":"First time here. The staff was very welcoming as soon as I entered. Got seated in a booth right away as It wasn't extremely busy for a Friday night. My server was very nice and helpful. Warm chips and salsa came to the table right away. The salsa was good and spicy. I ended up ordering a grilled salmon with scallops on a bed of white rice topped with onions, garlic and some tomato chunks. The food came fast; The flavor was very good but the scallops where a little too chewy. The salmon was well prepared and the rice was also good. The dish was over 22 dollars and IMHO the overall portion was a little small for the price. I would definitely go back and I do recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to live about 5 minutes from the Tres Potrillos in Fairlawn and we ate there at least once a week. When we noticed this location had opened we were very excited! This side of town doesn't have many good Mexican places, so we usually have to drive to Lakewood when we're craving a good burrito. This particular location is waaaay more fancy than the Fairlawn and the Medina location, which is kind of a turn off but makes sense since it is located in Beachwood. The food is not as good as the other locations, though. It is much more bland. The beans were very dry and the salsa was extremely mild. It was better than most of the other Mexican food on this side of town, but it wasn't mind blowing. It was significantly less greasy than the other options around here, so that is a definite plus. We will probably give it another chance and order something different."}
{"text":"First time I went there was the best Mexican I'd ever had!!!!! My family loved it !!!!! The deco is very nice. 

2nd time I went there I found a thick black hair in my food. I felt so ill after that. I was so grossed out got sick in the bathroom.  Will never eat at Harry's again!!! ."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service.  The margaritas are delicious- the basic house margarita gets the job done but if willing to splurge a little you can't go wrong with the Cadillac margarita! Food is delicious and authentic- our absolute favorite spot for burritos, enchiladas, and queso fundido!"}
{"text":"Wonderful menu and service. The Aztec soup is worth driving in from another state to have. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Best traditional Mexican spot in Cleveland! We have been here too many times to count and have never been disappointed. If you like margaritas, theirs can't be beat! Everything is hand made, and they squeeze the fresh lemons/limes/oranges right in front of you. The mix is also made fresh in house. The staff is very friendly and personable."}
{"text":"Short wait but overall poor service. No silverware, napkins or a bowl for chips/salsa. It took two requests to get a bowl for salsa. The appetizer comes and still no plates and silverware. \"How is everything?\"  We don't know... We can't eat our food. No plans to return believe me."}
{"text":"Tres Potrillos is our go to for local Mexican food. Everything we order is delicious.  Make sure to try all of the different margaritas."}
{"text":"Fast, decent Tex-Mex for few bucks more then you would expect. 

The atmosphere and service are great; It has a nice Western feel with the interior decoration, the wait staff and cooks work fast for lunch and dinner. Let me break done the Tex-Mex by the usual components; the complimentary chips are crisp and tasty, the salsa satisfies, the rice and beans are on par,  chicken and fish were OK, veggies are good but used sparingly. The grub will scratch your itch but my hunt for local comfort food will continue."}
{"text":"The other reviewers have hit many of the key points...warm chips and fresh salsa, great queso, reasonable prices - and food comes out in the blink of an eye. The patio is REALLY nice - other than the fact that it faces the main road. Ambiance is good, interior is bright and Mexican-y. 

Service can be hit or miss, but 90% of the time it's good. When it's good, it's REALLY good...when they were out of coloring pages for my daughter, the manager brought over a Kindle Fire so she could entertain herself for a bit. I thought that was awesome. :)

FYI - If you happen to have a coupon from the 2012-13 Entertainment book, they are not honoring it. Apparently you're supposed to check with Entertainment as some offers change after publication. Who knew!?"}
{"text":"Just returned from dinner and a great experience here.  The good was good - 4 star and not greasy like some of the other Medina county Mexican restaurants.  Our waiter, David, made the evening.  He was very professional yet relaxed and it was enjoyable to talk with him.  When the kitchen forgot to leave cheese off the veggie burrito he took it back quickly and made everything right.  Because of his service I bumped this up to 5 star.  It's rare to get a server who seems so genuinely interested in customers.  We'll be back and will be sure to ask for him again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner and it was one of the best Mexican dinners I have had in a long time. The Marguerita was the best I ever had. The guacamole was good and chips and salsa were also exceptional. This was our second visit and both times our meals and service were excellent. This is one of the best Mexican restaurants on the East side of town"}
{"text":"The first time I ate here I really liked it and was so excited to come back. Well, I finally made it back and for the life of me I can't figure out why I was so excited. I was not impressed at all by anything on my last visit. Not even the salsa. The food was very bland to me. 

Mexican food is my favorite to eat and I will not waste another trip here. No offense to this restaurant or the staff. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. I have just had way better Mexican food at other establishments. Also, compared to most other Mexican restaurants this place is a little more pricey. Maybe due to location... 

Cozumel in independence for the win!"}
{"text":"Very very good all around in every way. Great authentic Mexican food, authentic Mexican servers, clean restaurant, tasty! 
Chips and salsa were good, but a surprise salsa bite was quite hot. Top shelf margarita was delicious and highly recommended. AND FRIED ICE CREAM! They know what they are doing and they do it right!"}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. It was crazy this last Valentines Day and very hard to get a table. Usually, the restaurant seats you quickly and the food it hot and fresh. I like the tacos the most. I also love the margaritas as well and other cocktails they serve.  The parking is a bit tricky becasue it's right behind BP Gas Station and the intersections around the area are jammed packed a lot of the time, so be careful getting into the parking lot!"}
{"text":"If you want a restaurant that cook your scallops perfectly this is it. Like perfectly. Even I can't cook them this perfect. But the flavor was just good, not great. And service was good... The server kind of forgot about us for a little bit but that's fine we figured it out. :) Other than that they got some good things going..

They have the authenticity perfectly, down to the tineist detail. The music great! Sounds super family friendly and fun, but honestly I wouldn't know either way, for all I know the singers could've been describing human genitalia and it's mechanism in vivid detail, but it sounded nice. Also the battle for your food between you and the fly cartel is super invigorating."}
{"text":"Went here recently with a friend. Food was good, enjoyed some avocado tacos and queso dip. The dip was fantastic, but it's kind of hard to screw up yummy gooey cheese dip.  The tacos were fine. Nothing was particularly wrong with them, but I guess the ingredients didn't mesh as well as I'd anticipated.  There wasn't anything warm that was helping the avocados, tomatoes, and onion stick together so it was messier than anticipated. A little refried beans, warm rice, or salsa may have helped. Service was fine, but getting to the restaurant was a bit annoying. It's tucked behind a gas station and depending on which direction you're coming from, it can be hard to enter the parking lot. Wouldn't be opposed to returning here, but wouldn't plan on it unless suggested by someone else."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place at least 100x and never bothered to try it until I saw the ratings from other Yelpers. I do agree the food was fresh and delicious. Their salsa is house made.  Heck, the lettuce they serve with the entrees is fresh chopped iceberg. My shrimp chimichanga had a decent amount of large shrimp. And I liked how they put the red sauce and cheese on the side in serving bowls. Now I'm a huge fan of Abuelos, but Tres Potillos might just become my fav Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I was so impressed when we walked in. Decor is on point and service is excellent. Servers and staff are polite and you can tell it's very well run. The food was the best Mexican I have had in years. Classic but done perfect with extra effort. Love it and will be back again."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant. Very affordable. The kids love the cheese dip and quasadias. The chorizo sausage is the best."}
{"text":"Great food the fajitas are tasty and more than enough to share. The sangria is strong but tastes like juice. Plus some of the waiters look like male models. Defiantly a great place to eat or get drinks. The wait staff has a good sense of humor and make the guacamole right at the table! Love this place."}
{"text":"We visit here a couple of times per week.  The staff is friendly and provides first class service.  Your order is out of the kitchen faster than any restaurant I have visited.  The table side guac is a must order.  Every dish we have tried has been excellent.  Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"We had our first meal here today because our go-to Mexican joint was closed for the holiday. Wow! This place elevates the Mexican food experience. The $19/pitcher margaritas are delicious and reminded us of the ones we loved at our hotel in riviera maya. The salsa is fresh and delicious with more heat than you'll find at most places. We both appreciated the change. We ordered the Camarones al ajillo and the Chicago Burrito and shared both. The Burrito was delicious with tender beef and chorizo and fresh salsa verde, but the Camarones were the show stopper. Gently sautéed shrimp, red onions and dried chiles, with a very generous portion of whole cloves of garlic that had been pickled (I think!) to smooth mellow heavenliness, over a bed of perfectly cooked rice, topped with fresh tomatoes and avocado. This was a sophisticated dish, well beyond what we expected from this newish Mexican place. We'll be back...with friends."}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow but pleasant, the food failed to impress me and my guests as it was really quite bland. I lived in Arizona for half a decade and perhaps it spoiled me with amazing tex-mex and Mexican. If all the Tex-mex style food you have ever eaten was from around here you would probably rank it on par with most other similar restaurants but if you ever lived out west, forget it."}
{"text":"Best family Mexican restaurant in CLE.  Spicy burrito with chicken is excellent (sauce actually has spice to it and the chorizo on top is great).  Family has never been disappointed, unlike our experiences at other family Mexican restaurants where the food tends to be inconsistent."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Mexican spot. It's a little bit pricier than other options, but I justify the cost since the sauces seem house made and the food is so good.

Always ask for the hot salsa!"}
{"text":"In from out of town. 

Great service and one of the best Mexican meals and flan I've ever had. Try the shrimp dish on the review pics plus the habanero sauce."}
{"text":"I do not understand the bad reviews. The only reason I can come up with is they are fake.  Yes, the restaurant is a bit odd in its location, but the interior decor is quite nice.  My husband and I have been here about 5 times (tonight was one of them), and each time, the service and the food were just delicious.  The margaritas are fantastic!  The staff could not be more courteous and attentive.  We have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant on the east side and this certainly fills the bill.  The chips are hot and brought to the table with salsa immediately upon being seated.   I haven't tried dessert yet, as I am usually too full, but they look delicious.  My understanding is this is a family owned business, so why not give it a try?   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have driven by this restaurant multiple times and finally decided to stop by.  Nice interior, nice ambiance.  Large menu with several interesting items.  Nachos were large and warm, salsa watery with a bit of a spicy edge.  The top shelf margaritas are expensive, but very good.  We had the queso fundido.  Well done, cheese a bit stringy, and again a little spicy edge to it.  Then there were the entrees. We had the pollo mole poblano and the beef burrito.  Sauces were spot on but both meats tasted a bit strange.  The chicken was dry and rubbery in texture.  The beef was the same.  Neither tasted like they had any seasoning.  I am wondering if it is a cooking issue or if they were frozen/processed meats.  Although the server was friendly and attentive, the tastes of the meat will keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"Been here around 5-6 times. Every time the food has been good-outstanding. Service timely and friendly. Fair prices. Nice outdoor patio. Def gives Cozumel a run for their $. Will be back (soon, hopefully:)"}
{"text":"My work crew meets here pretty often and we always have good service and delicious food. Would definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"my fav restaurant. authentic and really tasty. i love the burrito mexicano. plus if you want to practice your spanish with the waiters you can! super fun and yummy. there's so much food you can have leftovers for two meals (at least I can) 12/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Two words: tableside guacamole."}
{"text":"The big pro was their guacamole. Amazing!

The rest was non spectacular - including the atmosphere, service, and food. The food didn't seem fresh. I got the chicken with chorizo and it was lumps of chicken without much flavor. The rice was bright orange and had shriveled peas in it. And I felt like prices were high for the portions and quality.

I will not be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a Saturday night before a movie for a date night dinner. We have had good Mexican food and bad Mexican food here in Cleveland so we were not sure what to expect coming in. 

The dining room is small and slightly noisy when it's packed, but the food more than makes up for that!

We received a basket of chips and each got an individual ramekin of salsa - slightly spicy with a sweet undercurrent - very tasty. The chips were warm. We asked the server whether we should get the guacamole appetizer or the table side guacamole and he said that they are basically the same thing, the only difference is the entertainment when they make it table side, so we should probably get the regular (and less expensive) one for the two of us - huge bonus points for the waiter! The guac was very good!

My wife got the chicken fajitas - not as many onions as she likes but the flavor was on point. So many restaurants try to over-season their fajitas, not the case here. I got the fish tacos. Wow. It's not often you can find an excellent fish taco here in town and this was all that and more! Highly recommend the fish tacos. 

We also got a frozen peach margarita. Very nice, not too sweet.

All in all an excellent experience and we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Certainly not the best Mexican I've had, but such a bargain.

Lunch time special could not be beat.

2 Chile rellenos for under $10 is a steal"}
{"text":"The queso with shrimp was delicious.  It came with three small tortillas.  The queso plus 2 tortillas and some chips and salsa was enough for dinner for me.  The place is next to a gas station near intersection of Richmond and Chagrin.  There's outdoor seating though it looks out into a parking lot.  The menu is pretty expansive though I wish they had a la carte options.  Their specialty fajitas and made to order guac are on my list to try next time.  The shrimp queso was heavy but I would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner with my young son and husband on a Saturday night. Seated right away and had multiple people come to our table within a minute of sitting down to make sure our drink orders were taken. Place wasn't too busy since it was before 6pm. No issues ordering and food was fairly prompt. Avocado tacos were fantastic! Lots of flavor. I do agree with the other reviews on the rice being dry. Most likely made in a big batch sometime during the week. Used the limes from my tacos to add some moisture and it was decently edible. The other food isn't over the top but it is your standard Mexican fair. If you come in expecting that then you won't be disappointed. Ordered the flan for dessert and it was pretty good. Don't know if they make it in house but it did NOT have the tell tale rings on the edges that say it came from a can (have seen this at other Mexican restaurants) and the sugar glaze (the stuff on the top after the flan is flipped) was super creamy and not watery like most canned flan I have had. All the servers were very pleasant and prompt. An overall very pleasant experience and we will be back again (unlike Lopez over in CH which was a super downer both times visiting)."}
{"text":"I started my meal with chips  and salsa with some queso.  The salsa and queso were great but the chips themself were a let down.  Some were either under cooked or stale and just not my fav flavor.

For my entree i had the lunch fajitas express.  As advertised the fajitas came out FAST.  The portion was more than adequate for a lunch menu item and it had TONS of meat.  I took half of it with me and ate it for dinner.  All in all (other than the chips not being my favorite ever), I left full and happy.

Oh service was good.  Attentive but not over bearing."}
{"text":"Visited at lunch time. The place wasn't very busy so no wait. Restaurant was clean and attractive. Service was mediocre at best. They brought us chips and salsa that was a bit too spicy. The waiter never introduced himself and throughout the entire meal he made us feel like we were bothering him. Food was decent but nothing to make it stand out from any other Mexican eatery. I had the Taco Salad and quite honestly, I could have saved a couple of bucks and had a better Taco Salad at Taco Bell. I am not asking for 5-Star quality for $7.50 but at least make it memorable so I want to come back. I work literally within walking distance of this restaurant but have no reason to return."}
{"text":"Maybe a 2.5 vote bc not much flavor... Guacamole sampler had 0 flavor - totally disappointing. Burrito bowl was small and overcooked. Seafood burrito was \"fine\" - again, underwhelming. Burrito Chicago - boring (but oh the description sounded so good!). The reason this is a 3 instead of 2 is bc of the El Chavo - cheesy goodness.  

In conclusion: We won't go back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times because of its location. food is always mediocre at best. But today the server was actively rude. When we said we'd like to order our drinks and lunch at the same time he said no. We thought there must be someone else coming to take our food order but he came back with drinks and and then looked at us like ww were wasting his time. I said are you taking our food order and he nodded giving the same look. when the food came out mine did not have cheese on it. When he finally came back around I told him there was no cheese. 
This is where it goes from bad to outrageous. he turned on the flashlight on his phone, shined it on the plate and said look there's cheese sauce right there I can see it.
 There was absolutely no cheese anywhere. I was eating the dish because we were in a hurry. There was no cheese. I said so. He said no, its right there. I said thats the sour cream. He said no. 

I asked for the check and he again looked at me like I had asked to move to a different table. He didn't ask us if we wanted the check split. There were only two of us. When he picked up our cards he ran so quickly that we didn't have time to even tell him to split the check. I work just around the corner from this place and I will never eat lunch or dinner here again."}
{"text":"Great flavors. I had the Azteca burrito and it was cooked beautifully. My raspberry margarita was also very delicious"}
{"text":"Yum! A colleague and I were in town for a business trip and decided to venture out for our first night in Cleveland. 

We searched for restaurants in the area and noticed this place was rated 4-stars. I'm not use to too many Mexican restaurants having higher ratings without it being too formal. 
So of course we were intrigued and decided to go. 

The decor is nice, the entire staff was amazingly friendly and the menu.......perfect. I ordered the Texans Fajita and it was so delicious!!! I forgot what my colleague ordered but she enjoyed her plate just as much. 

The food is very well priced, comes out quick, and again the staff is great. Our corporate office is close by so I will most certainly recommend this restaurant to others traveling in. 

Quick tip - it's tucked in the back by a gas station so you may miss it."}
{"text":"Best top shelf margaritas in 3 counties! Food is always amazing too. We have never left here not happy! Awesome bar. Try the street tacos if you like really hot, spicy food. Seafood is good as well...we like the fajitas for 2."}
{"text":"I was holed up in one of the hotels across the street for two days. I ate all of my meals here. I was not disappointed in the least!
The fish tacos were possibly the best I have ever had. I could only take down two of the three in one sitting.
The other dish I tried was the carnitas lunch special which was amazing! Way too much food for one person but it tasted so good I didn't want to walk away. Felt great during and after each meal. My only negative takeaway was the chips and salsa. Nothing there to write home about but on the other hand, they are complimentary so who am i to complain?

Highly recommended from a relatively picky/ health food leaning diner."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I just happened upon Tres Potrillos for a pre-show dinner and I'm so glad we did as it was quite fantastic! The interior of the restaurant is beautiful with a dining section and a small more casual section near the bar where we were seated. There's also a nice large dining room in the downstairs portion of the restaurant for parties or additional seating. Service was great with our main server and others checking in with us about drink/chip refills, etc. 

We were started off with some chips and salsa (YUM!) and I thought it was a nice touch that each person gets an individualized salsa bowl.  (I mean, I don't usually mind sharing but it's even cooler to have your own, right?!) I ordered the street tacos which arrived looking absolutely divine in their taco holder with the onion, cilantro, and spicy tomatillo sauce as promised.  These tacos did not disappoint and I'd be hard-pressed to order anything else on my return because... 

1) Filled with deliciously tender and flavorful steak and spicy chorizo.
2) Sweet and savory pineapple.
3) Soft corn tortilla shells.
4) Super awesomely flavorful beans on the side (I must be doing beans wrong, I'm so sorry beans.)
5) TACOS.

My only regret was leaving a taco behind because we were Uber-ing all over the place that night and short of shoving it in my purse I wasn't going to have a way to get it home. (I'll miss you!!!! *Cue the sad and wistful music*)   

Also, reminder to self to bring advanced locking Tupperware EVERYWHERE, in case of TACO. I am trying to live my best life in 2018 after all!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 6 and went to eat here last night because of the 5 star review. Food was good, portions small for the price. Waiter never smiled, never refilled our water or chips. Then when we asked to get a second pina colada and a corona, the waiter took 10 minutes to come back without a corona and said they were out of rum. He did offer a margarita but no apology for taking too long and said nothing about the corona. During our dinner there were a few intoxicated customers walking thru and the table of 6 beside us did a dine and ditch. Maybe they had the same service we did?"}
{"text":"Very average food & pricy!! Also they recently increased the prices for lunch menu too. $20 for basic weekday lunch @ average Mexican place is too much!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit here. I made a reservation for 7pm on a Saturday, but there were plenty of empty tables. Our drink order came right away, but the food order was about 20 minutes. The food was good, but unexciting. We'll try it again, before we write it off."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the staff was excellent! Definitely going back! The 5 year old that was at our table spilled an entire glass of ice water and none of the staff even seemed to mind!"}
{"text":"Unfriendly hostess.  Freezing cold.  The chicken enchiladas were cold, the chicken within was dry, and the taste was bland.

The fajitas were standard for Mexican restaurants, nothing special.

My wife's bean and cheese enchiladas were good but the chorizo enchilada was bad.

Servings were decent portions."}
{"text":"I was super impressed! I am not a Mexican food lover, but this place was great! The fish tacos were the best Fish tacos I have ever eaten. Good service. Great chips and salsa. Sooo delicious!"}
{"text":"So good. I ordered \"El Chavo\" and it was so good. Good flavor, good size, good price. :) would recommend"}
{"text":"Not your average bland mexican restaurant. The food here is phenomenal,  full of flavor. The guacamole is so good.  I have never had a bad meal here. The service is also very good."}
{"text":"I loved it! I was especially happy with the guacamole made table side!"}
{"text":"I can give this place an A+ in the service department, however the food was very disappointing. The fajitas texanas portion was very mediocre in terms of flavor and preparation. The plate was large, but meats were largely undercooked and most of the skillet was filled with chicken and bell peppers, as opposed to beef, onions and shrimp. I've had at least 20 different preparations of fajitas in my life and this one simply did not cut it. We also asked to have our guac extra hot, it was prepared to be barely mild."}
{"text":"Who would think that there is good Mexican food in Medina, OH of all places.  

My cousins and I went on a Thursday night over the summer.  The weather was nice so we chose to sit outside like the rest of the patrons at the restaurant.  

The service was decent.  We did have to gain the attention of our waiter so we could get more salsa and refills on our drinks.  The food was good.  I got the burrito special which was really tasty and filling.  I could have make two meals out of it.  

I'm glad Tres Potrillos is in Medina.  I also love the location being right off of 18 and across the street from Buehlers."}
{"text":"So sad.. this has been my favorite Mexican in town until recently. Waitress forgot our appetizer (never got it), our water, a special instruction on my tacos.. And then there was a hair stuck in my rice. I appreciated the new tacos & the introduction to the happy hour menu but I don't think I'll be able to come back for awhile. :/"}
{"text":"Try the Pollo con Calavaza (if you like spicy, creamy chicken with veggies). It was so tasty that I'm still thinking about it. The service was good and very fast, and the cocktail I had was lovely. The only reason it's not a perfect five is that my chips weren't super fresh. They were passable though, and the salsa was tasty."}
{"text":"I really didn't expect to like this restaurant as much as I did. Honestly. From the street it looks small, and the fact that its parking lot is connected to a gas station's parking lot isn't helping its curb appeal. But this is actually a cule little place once you step inside. 

The bar area is a little small. My large party waited there while tables were setup. But I had one of the best margaritas I've ever had in a bar while I was waiting (the agave margarita - fresh, flavorful, and made with real fruit - even though it cost $12), so I was happy to spend a little bit of time there. 

The restaurant was somewhat crowded for a Wednesday night, so my party of 14 was split into two tables. I personally hate rolling up to any restaurant with that many people, so I was fine having to sit in groups. 

As soon as we sat down, we each received our own little bowl of salsa and some communal chips. The salsa was a little spicy, but not unbearable. And the chips were nice and fresh. I may have eaten a whole plate of them by myself. Oops. 

I was especially pleased to see an entire vegetarian section on the menu. There were at least a half dozen delicious sounding items that could easily be veganized. I decided to order the best avocado tacos I've had in my life. The looked simple, but the avocado, pico, and fresh lime were flavorful and filling. But not. \"I ate so much I'm going to die,\" filling. The black beans that came with my tacos were just ok. Nothing special. 

Even though I was seated with a large group, service was on point. Our drinks kept getting refilled, our chips were frequently refreshed, and we all received accurate checks in a timely manner. 

There was nothing I didn't like about this restaurant. It might be my new go-to Mexican restaurant in my hood. It's definitely worth checking out if you're looking for some good Mexican grub. Skip the place that'd further north on Richmond Road in Richmond Heights."}
{"text":"In a very odd site but we had an excellent dinner and drinks for a reasonable cost. Good Margaritas and cheerful, helpful service."}
{"text":"The food was good. The decor and space is great. The location is easy to get to in the evening, but rush our is a little rough at at this intersection. The staff are real mexican people who still have their accents. It's great to see a place that is still more authentic like this. The manager here checks in and cares about what goes on."}
{"text":"One of the cleaner mexican restaurants in the area.. I classify Mexican in 2 forms... Dirty and classy... WE love dirty Mexican where you get a whole bunch of cheap good food for a cheap price and leave comfortably full and possibly hating yourself... This is close to being one of those places but due to being in beachwood tend to be on the pricier side. Ive had the Fajitas burritos, and tacos and all tasted good. The drinks were sub par as they are in most Mexican places(im not huge in to margarita mainly for that reason) so i would stick with beer and its really hard to mess that up."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a 5 star! The food and service are excellent ! I would highly recommend it to anyone! We always ask for Andreas when we go there! Best waiter in town! Always has a smile and his service is awesome! The Margaritas are to die for! The porch that they added is great when the weather is nice! One of my favorite Mexican restaurants!"}
{"text":"Stay away today, service is slow and bad! The food and service normally is good, for some reason today the food was ok and the service horrible. We order drinks from 3 different servers and on the first and second delivery the drinks were wrong. Once food was delivered no one ever came back! We would have liked to have more drinks but no one ever came back. Would have liked more napkins no one ever came back! Maybe just a bad day, but I won't go back for awhile!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place since it opened.  It was crowded so I sat at the bar and ordered a small margarita and carne asada.   I waited over 45 minutes for my food, asked 3 different people to check on it, and never got it.  I asked for the bill, was charged for a large margarita, paid for that and left.  One of the bartenders told me that the reason my food never came was because they were having a large party downstairs, not sure how that helps me?  I will never go back, wasted $10.00 on 3 sips of a margarita, stale chips and terrible salsa."}
{"text":"I almost want to keep this review to myself, as I don't want Tres to get overrun by people looking for a decent Mexican dinner...but I also want to make sure they stay open. Chips and salsa were excellent, the queso was delicious, and the carne asada, barbacoa, and carnitas tacos are all phenomenal. Everyone that I've gone here with has loved their choices as well, tried just a bit of the gf's chicken salad and it was great as well, plus the service has been excellent on several visits now."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were good. The spinach sauce on some of the stuff didn't taste that great. Guac 'made already' may taste better than the 'made to order' at the table. It was a fun experience though!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place for the first time while travelling - it was convenient to get to and right off the highway.  I had a seat at the bar and the tequila selection was very nice.  The interior is much nicer than I expected for a Mexican restaurant in the area.  Everything looked new and modern, unlike some of their competitors which are on the divey side.  The bartender and staff were very friendly and helped steer me in the direction of which tequila (herradura) and margarita I would like best.  They were both very good and I learned so much about tequila to help me order the next time!  My guacamole and tacos were also very good.  I can't say enough things about the experience and quality of the food and drinks, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Ok. I don't even like Mexican food that much. But I can't stop thinking about the Puerco con salsa verde. And the sangria. I mean, why is it so good? And the staff. You can ask them for anything. I am ashamed to say I pretty much go every week at this point. The chips and salsa are on point. The decor is cute. I think they even have a party room. If you haven't been, you gotta go."}
{"text":"While the location, accessed from a BP gas station entry, may be off-putting you should overlook that and head straight to this Mexican restaurant. It is offering some of the freshest tasting and modern Mex food you can find on the east side of Cleveland. They also offer table-side guacamole service meaning a cart arrives at your table and your server makes the freshest guacamole you'll find around Cleveland. The limes and avocado are cut and squeezed right in front of your eyes. It's definitely a unique dining experience. This places is all about freshness from the street tacos that come in a taco holder to grilled chicken with chorizo in a burrito each thing I've had tastes so fresh. This place should be on your list for dining out. Oh and also the margaritas are simply perfect for the tequila fan. I really can't say enough how great this place is."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to visit this restaurant while driving home after running errands this evening. We decided to eat outside and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and nice evening. The hostess was very nice and quickly seated us at the table we wanted. We no sooner had taken our seats then chips and salsa had appeared. The salsa was presented in a carafe that held enough so that we could refill the salsa dish a couple of times...very clever and appreciated!

The chips and salsa were tasty and had a nice zest and tang to it which you certainly don't find in typical Midwestern \"mexican\" restaurants. Having grown up out west I definitely was excited at this discovery. My wife and I both ordered Margaritas; both were of a good size and tasted of freshly squeezed limes and a generous amount of tequila...just right!

For dinner I ordered the 3 taco special, my wife going with the same (mostly because she liked my choice!). For an appetizer, we simply ordered homemade guacamole to go with our chips. The guacamole was refreshing and fresh. Even my picky and a half year old son liked it!

The main course was delicious...simple soft tacos with grilled beef and lettuce, pico de gallo and an avocado-lime-cilantro sauce to add along with black beans. I also added some of the guacamole and it made for a filling and savory soft taco.

During the meal, our waitress came to check on us and was very nice to us and our son. The people running this restaurant are great hosts with a friendly attitude.

We finished the guac and chips for dessert..a perfect finish in this case along with our remaining margarita.

I was truly impressed here. We will be coming back sometime in the near future, hopefully bringing some friends with us!"}
{"text":"Oh my yum!

I was craving Mexican food last night in Cleveland and searched Yelp for a nearby spot, which led me to Tres Potrillos.  Thanks, Yelp - it was awesome!

Located in a non-descript building in the Beachwood area, this appears to be a family owned spot.  The inside was very authentic and the service was good.  I really enjoyed the fresh and warm chips and spicy salsa.  We also ordered jumbo margaritas (which packed a punch) and were impressed with the low price tags on them.  For my meal, I got the enchiladas supremas which were all very flavorful and filling.

I love a good Mexican meal and this one did no disappoint.  It really was filling, fresh, and authentic.  I will be back next time in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Mexican food. Decor is nice and service is prompt. Complimentary salsa and chips are provided.  Unfortunately the rest of the food is inconsistent. I had the burrito Azteca in which the (three) shrimp were excellent but the chicken and steak were dry and tasteless, as if boiled.  The rest of it was overfilled with bell peppers, of which I was not fond. The three sauces added nothing to flavor.  My friend had fish tacos which he seemed to enjoy, although they had a bit too much sauce on them. I might consider going here again purely out of convenient location, but definitely wouldn't seek it out.

UPDATE
After prior review, the manager contacted me about my concerns and offered us a gift card to return. We came back this week. We would actually rate 3 1/2 stars. The service was excellent and prompt. Complimentary chips and salsa came out promptly.  Grilled fish tacos had moist, flavorful fish and fresh vegetables, although tortillas were a bit cold.  Mexican rice was well cooked but seemed to be just salted rice. My dining companion had shrimp quesadilla which contained large, well-cooked shrimp, although the overall quesadilla needed doctoring with hot sauce and salsa, which were readily provided.

Overall, the service and decor are highlights.  Food is a little pricey for what you get. There are definitely some items we would return for and some which are less consistent. Fish and shrimp seem consistently good, not so sure about other meats."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally checked this one off our bucket list and will be there again. I completely thought this place was just fancy burrito joint but was happily wrong. It's more of a fancy Mexican restaurant - a good place to bring the parents. 
    I order the seafood enchiladas (comes with three enchiladas filled with shrimp and scallops covered in a spinach sauce and Mexican rice for $14) not only was it very good dinner the left overs were really good the next day even cold. The to-go containers are the heavy foil ones which obviously aren't great for reheating when you don't have an extra plate to throw the food onto.  But seriously it was still tasted cold!  
  The only not great thing was the margarita which seemed over-priced with a poor pour of tequila.
  But yes we will be back.  Looking forward to trying them for lunch when the prices are a little lower."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was cozy and our waiter was really attentive and seemed like a cool guy. I ordered the fish tacos and they were the best I've ever had. Our food came out almost unbelievably fast, no more than 15 minutes after we ordered. I'd recommend Tres Potrillos to anyone!"}
{"text":"Hi there Arturo! Yes, I was only giving a rating based on pictures. I have not yet been to your restaurant, but will plan to come in soon! The pictures look good, but for my husband, flavor is what really matters to him! Thank you for responding!"}
{"text":"I firmly believe that Tres Potrillos is one of the best local Mexican restaurants in the area. The food is delicious, the staff is friendly and they are extremely accommodating to large groups. The huarache is my favorite meal. It's a fajita dish that I chose to get with chicken. It's cooked with onion, peppers and chorizo then topped with Mexican cheese. It always comes out hot with the vegetables caramelized.  Their salsa is delicious and served in individual bowls for each guest. Don't skip the appetizers. The queso fundido is to die for. Be sure to ask for it with chorizo!  Tres Potrillos is a must stop if you're in the area!!!"}
{"text":"Visually atmosphere very nice. Unfortunately every surface is hard and ceilings very high.  Put a few tables with loud excited kids or adults having a good loud time, not saying people shouldn't enjoy themselves - I say party on, however the noise can become unbearable. If you can, sit outside on the large covered patio. Service acceptable but not outstanding. There were multiple servers at the ready to get you what you need if your server becomes MIA for a bit.

Small mango Margarita: fair size for $. Very mild mango flavor. Overall a little weak & watery tasting. Couldn't tell there was ANY alcohol in it. Decent selection of beers per the guys in our party.

Chips and Salsa very good: delicious light, warm & crunchy chips. Mild salsa is very mild and the hot is hot.

Husband had Fajitas Supreme which he said was not very interesting in taste & he likes everything plain. Even the single portion is large and can easily be shared by two especially if you order any appetizers or fill up on chips and drinks. My Carnitas Tapatias was very bland. There were 6 in our party. Their food choices included Fajitas, burritos and something that was stew like served with or in salsa verde.  Due to the noise we paid up and went elsewhere for drinks and dessert.  Spent most of that time talking about other preferred Mexican restaurants in Cleveland.

Don't think any of us will be rushing back to Tres Potrillos. Sorry. I really wanted to enjoy it."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. I felt like I died and went to taco heaven. Sure my meal didn't come with rice and beans and I had to order them on the side but I was okay with that. The staff was quick, nice and proactive. The tacos were filling and the presentation was beyond perfect. If you get the chance to have enough room for a dessert definitely make good choices and get the Churro dessert. I've had a lot of churros and these are in my top three best churros. It felt like death by Churro as the strawberry sauce and the whipped cream paired well with the cinnamon and fluffiness of the Churro. Next time I'm in town, I'll definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Service was 3 stars.  Started off ... Eh.  But got better as things slowed down.
Pitcher of margaritas was excellent.  Queso was fine... Nothing great.  I ordered fish tacos (grilled).  They were AMAZING!!!!  Side of rice came with was over salted..... But the fish tacos were so delicious I didn't care.
Husband had the chimichanga meal.... He complained at how small they were.... But when he took his first bite he was hooked!  
If we pass through here again in the future we must stop here!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this two times and each time I had a complaint. The first time the food was extremely cold. They did not bring us silver ware until after our food was sitting on our table. Then the margaritas are to sweet. Then the fajita my friend ordered was served with at least 2 bell peppers to fill up the plate ."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this incarnation of Tres Potrillos.  We have dined numerous times at the Montrose location.  We're definite fans.  
We frequently both get a seafood dish of some kind as they don't overcook the stuff, somewhat unusual in a cuisine largely based on cooking every dish for hours!
Today was no exception.  
The lady got the Camerones del Crema, shrimp with a cream/red sauce, and I got the seafood chimichanga that had both shrimp and scallops in a pleasant spinach filling superbly done.  
She ALWAYS gets that dish as it's one of her favorites.  
Hers came with beans and rice, (shocker!)  
Mine came with a small side salad dressed with sour cream, no beans or rice.  
I've never understood the whole beans and rice phenomenon at Mexican restaurants.  I'm not a huge fan of either, but it does serve to flesh out a meal and I must admit if you dump your left over salsa on the rice it makes for quite a flavor boost, but alas I had no beans or rice on which to perform this ritual.  
When asked they will grill your chimichanga rather than deep-fry it if you prefer to get more return on your calorie fix.  
Service is usually quite good and today was no exception.
The tortilla chips are always served warm and the salsa today actually had a bit of heat to it.  That was refreshing!"}
{"text":"First of all, kudos to this app for helping me find this place. 

My friend and I were aiming for their lunch hours for the discounted food. Unfortunately we missed it but on the more fortunate side we came right on time for happy hour! $4 jumbo margs and $5 appetizers. It was a very solid deal. We ordered the extra large burritos and were very satisfied with the portions, taste and price. The service was pretty good up until the end where our waitress took too long to bring us the checks and boxes. However, seeing as we were seated on their beautiful patio on a beautiful day with our drinks, there wasn't a rush and I didn't mind."}
{"text":"A coworker and I tried this place out for lunch today. The service was nice and quick for our hour lunch break. The food was great. I wish they had those pre-made lunch combos a lot of other places have but still the choices we made were great. I had enchiladas and my coworker had the Ohio steak entree. We both opted for beans instead of rice and the server looked at us like we were nuts, but we felt good about our choice. The service was pretty basic, not quote friendly but very timely and on my lunch break I really don't mind sacrificing some pleasantries for fast service.  There's definitely a few more things on the menu I would like to try so I think we will be back."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for warm tortilla chips and good salsa.  If you can get me there, I'm pretty much hooked.

The interior has a standard, Mexican-restaurant feel, but it is cozy and the staff is friendly.  I've been here twice, and each time has been in the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday, so it has been empty, but the setup looks like it would work well for a large group.

I'm always surprised at the size of their drinks.  I could only describe the size of their beers as Big Gulp.  A little intense, but served in a frosty mug, it's a nice topper to the meal.

The food is great.  Nothing insanely spectacular but just solid food.  It is definitely the best Tex-Mex that I have had in Medina.

They generally have some pretty good coupons and offers available if you keep your eyes peeled.

Tres Potrillos is a quality establishment, so please support them if you get the chance."}
{"text":"We like to dine out on Friday night's, we're new to Medina, and we love Mexican food, so naturally, Tres Potrillos comes up on our radar. We showed up with seven people and were seated after about 15 minutes. 

Fresh tortilla chips and salsa were served and our drink orders were taken. I ordered a water and a large frozen margarita. A few minutes later, our drinks were served and our dinner orders were taken. So I ordered the fish tacos. Then I chowed down on some tasty chips and salsa. The salsa had just the right amount of heat and a great homemade flavor that I loved. This chips were still warm from the deep fryer too! Yum!

My fish tacos looked appetizing and they tasted good. They didn't have a lot of fish on them. The fish was breaded and deep fried, not baked as I would prefer. So the fish tacos were just okay and they weren't very filling. However, with all the chips I ate plus the large margarita, I was quite full by the end of the meal.

I will try their fajitas on my next visit as I make my way around the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. Beautiful interior. Must try the guacamole! My boyfriend is vegan and the server, Antonio, was extremely accommodating to his dietary needs. The manager stopped over to our table to make sure everything was satisfactory. Needless to say, we will be back and will be asking for Antonio!"}
{"text":"Finally a place on the Eastside for authentic Mexican food! This is what we used to expect from Lopez and Gonzalez. The restaurant is beautiful, the food delicious, and the wait staff responsive and professional."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  The food is always good.  Haven't found anything on the menu I didn't like."}
{"text":"Really great mexican restaurant! New, clean, beautiful place to sit down and have a nice meal with family and friends. I got the shrimp tacos and they were delicious ... I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican we eat here at least twice a week. Food is very good so is the service. The restaurant is very clean. The chips and salsa are great. I recommend anything with there shredded beef oh so good. We been here for lunch or dinner. Never disappointed great food."}
{"text":"This was definitely not my favorite Mexican restaurant. I was in town on business  travel and I just wanted to pick-up some food and get back to my room so I could get some work done. Anyway, I thought the service at the hostess desk was not friendly at all. The food was not flavorful at all. I got the burrito bowl with chicken and I  just did not care for it. I would suggest if someone is looking for a burrito bowl to go to Chipotle, it's much better."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place that I could get a nice relaxing dinner.  Of all the places close by, this seemed to have the most promise from the reviews I read.
The atmosphere was just right, and the staff more than complimented it.
It was hard to decide on what to get, there are so many yummy options in the menu.  So I just went with what first caught my eye - the Shrimp Chimichanga.
Now it's going to be hard to try anything else next time, it was so fantastic.  The only hard part was figuring out how to eat it.  Do I pick it up and dip it in the sauce each bite like a giant egg roll?  Or do I use a knife and fork?
I opted for the knife and fork, so I could have some of the lettuce and tomato with each bite.  But I think next time I'll just pick it up and eat the lettuce and tomato with whatever spills out.
Oh, that's right - I'm going to pick something else next time - RATS!"}
{"text":"Being as I'm from Texas we have complete access to Great Tex-Mex & traditional Mexicano meals. This place was neither. We ordered a steak & chicken breast plate which came with arroz, frijoles, pico de gallo y guacamole. The steak was thin, & fatty. The chicken breast was orange in appearance from spice but lacked taste & definition from said spice. The frijoles were mediocre they lacked the true all day simmer with lard that gives the distinct flavor. My husband ordered flour tortillas with our meal & to my shock & amusement the tortillas were not fresh but store bought. The service was great, food came out in a timely manner, & the restaurant is clean for those points I'm awarding them 2 stars."}
{"text":"We like to come here because the atmosphere is a bit more high end than the other chain Mexican restaurant near our house, the appetizer selection for happy hour is amazing, and they easily accommodated change to the dishes. 

Ordered the chicken flautas for an appetizer- huge and tasty! Added some salsa for heat. Husband got the chick, steak, and shrimp fajitas. Very good. We both had leftovers for days!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad. Came in tonight on a Yelp-inspired short-notice reservation with a group of 17 hungry people. The restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel, so this was an easy choice for us. 

Tres Potrillos treated us right. Drink orders were taken quickly, plenty of chips and salsa on the table. We had multiple servers and once we made up our minds, our orders were taken. And within a very reasonable amount of time, our orders were delivered, again by multiple servers. (Other restaurants should get a clue here - any group this large requires more than one server!) 

So, after all this, why only four stars? This is a good  - but not great - Mexican restaurant. Food was decent, maybe even a bit better than decent. But I've eaten Mexican in multiple states and countries and this is a more American-ified food rather than a traditional plate.  Regardless, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been remiss in not reviewing this restaurant earlier. I get there about once a week when I'm craving either avocado tacos or chile rellenos (both superb). The staff is unfailingly friendly and helpful. 

What inspired me to finally write a review is a variation on a different type of margarita that they serve. If you enjoy spicy and like some adventure, talk to Lou (the bartender) about making you a \"Ultimate Jalapeno Margarita.\" It's a step up from the \"spicy margarita\" you may see on the menu board. 

Lou squeezes fresh citrus, then chops fresh jalapeno and cilantro and adds Cuervo 1800 Silver that has been infused with jalapeno. A bit of simple syrup, ice and a professional shaking make a truly taste-bud tingling experience (the only thing that I can think of that comes close is a hand-muddled mojito, and this is way better if you like spicy). Lou will vary the heat to order and I can't think of a drink that is as satisfying on so many levels of flavor. 

If you like the drink, bug Alejandro (part of the family that owns the place) to add it to the official menu. Also, if you get the avocado tacos, be sure to get a side of extra avocado with the house habanero on the side. Trust me, it's a great meal."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat as we were passing through Ohio, and based on the good Yelp reviews we decided to give this place a try.  Overall the prices were good and the food was yummy.  I'd recommend it and for the most part say go with the seafood options, they were better than the beef."}
{"text":"Good service, food and atmosphere. Choose booths or tables. Or sit at the bar. The place is very nice. This time we ordered a carafe of Sangria. So fruity and fresh!  The carafe is enough for three people, or four pouring smaller amounts. Early in the week is slower than the busy weekends.  Look for Tres Protrillos behind the gas station. Enter off Richmond Road."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants and the manager is nice to look at too haha but really fantastic food and always consistent! Their margaritas and guacamole are hands down some of the best I've ever had! I come here or get take out at least once a week.. It's fantastic and such a great ambiance if you're feeling like fantastic Mexican food go here!!"}
{"text":"I came here a few days ago with some friends. As far as it goes, Tres Portrillas does not deviate much from other Mexican restaurants I've been to. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though! 

The chips and salsa are excellent; the chips are easily the size of my face. The staff was always ready to refill the chip bowls and salsa (which I'm not ashamed to admit happened more than four times...within like 20 minutes).

The main entree (supreme enchiladas) was decent - four enchiladas with one cheese, one beef, one chicken, and one bean. Not the best I've had, but definitely not bad for ~$12. 

If you're not willing to risk the stomach illness from Taco Bell and want some Mexican, go ahead and come here!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby! I have been here twice and I will say it was better the first time. The tableside guac is a must have. Myself and two of my girlfriends went to celebrate an early birthday dinner for me. We each got a different order of tacos and then shared...shrimp tacos, Mexican street tacos and barbacoa. I like spicy, very spicy BUT the sauce that came with the barbacoa and Mexican street tacos was on another level..unenjoyably (i know that's not word) spicy. No complaints on the service, our server was very nice and gave us ideas for ways to make different types of guac. They gave us fried ice cream for dessert and that stuff should be illegal...it is so good!"}
{"text":"The service at the bar is terrible. The head bartender looks like a gang member and glared at me when I told him I didn't like the drinks. The drinks are pre made and awful. It's not all bad however. The flavor infused tequila shots are delicious and cheap! The food was just good. So get a few shots, chase them with Mexican beer and eat some street tacos. If you're looking for something more than that, you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"We ate at the bar.  Love the guacamole and smooth salsa! Drinks were great! Service was very good and everyone was very friendly.  Food was great!  My only comment is that the bar stools are very unstable (even before any Tequila), as they have 3 legs.  So, I will definitely be back and will tell my friends...but I will sit at a table..."}
{"text":"You will not find A better Mexican restaurant they take good care of you and the food is sooooo gooood you will be not disappointed"}
{"text":"I saved this restaurant to review it later and then was like what the heck is this?? Oh that little place! I loved that place. This place was so good. I just got the fish tacos for lunch. Very nice! I think they were crispy fish. Delicious thin soft flour tortillas. Excellent meal! Was out super quick. I was probably there like 15 minutes only. The waiter was shocked I ate so quick but I didn't have anyone to talk to lol. check please!

Give them a try.  A great lunch option in a ridiculous area of super busy dumb places. Go here and then pity your workmates. Or dinner! good food - really good service."}
{"text":"Clean and fast.  Went for lunch and stopped b cause it had a four star.  Nothing unique or special but it was good and a fair price. So feels like a 4 star to me."}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego, I want good Mexican food and it has been a struggle! This place was great! The guy that brought us to our table was kinda rude because he literally pointed at the table then completely left us to go talk to another table. BUT our waiter, Francisco was awesome! We even told him about our California Burritos and he told us they sounded different but something he had to try. The food was great compared to other \"Mexican\" food we've tried here. Service was awesome and food was awesome. This will definitely be our go to from now on!"}
