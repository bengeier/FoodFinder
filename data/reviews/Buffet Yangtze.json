{"text":"High-volume, low cost Chinese buffet that is targeted at the gluttonous, but has an edge with some more high end items such as crab legs and sushi.  Yes, I have been know to be gluttonous on occasion. It's also the kind of place you take weird distant relatives to because you're not sure what they like to eat, but you can still find a few nice things for yourself without wasting money on the weirdos.  FYI, they've been fined tens of thousands of dollars for health code violations in the past, which seems like a rite of passage for this type of restaurant.  I'd take a few shots of hard liquor to disinfect when you get home, just to be sure :-)"}
{"text":"First of all, I like the new look from their 'new' location. Classy & clean looking.  I give this restaurant 5 stars for their lunch buffet, but I would only give 3 stars for their more expensive, and lesser quality dinner buffet. Their lunch buffet includes dimsums of decent quality, while their dinner buffet lacks those dim sums, while adding meat selections that are sub-par in quality and taste.  Pretty impressive quality of food with their low cost = 5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"The GOOD. I did actually enjoyed the food or most of the food especially the shrimps and vegetables. I found that the dishes had a variety of flavour which unlike most buffets are bland and all taste the same.  The wonton soup is delicious and the Singapore vermicelli noodles. To be honest I could live on appetisers but I like to try the other foods to as I say they were okay.The deserts were okay and that ice cream is delicious.    The BAD  Your drinks were not included in the buffet which surprised me but whatever.  They had like a stirfry bar and I had no idea what I was supposed to do with it and when I asked the staff none of them could answer me in English and had no idea what I was saying. So I couldn't attempt the stirfry bar because I have no idea what to do. They run out of clean dishes so it took for ever waiting for more dishes to have more food. It was extremely busy and the staff couldn't keep up with the turnover neither in the buffet or the tables. At $22 ahead I would expect the service to be a little bit higher than what was given and also you had to request fortune cookies which is really quite annoying. My husband said it definitely wasn't worth the money it was okay.   The UGLY  We went on a Saturday evening myself my husband,my eight month old daughter and two friends. It took us 45 minutes to get a seat and when I requested A highchair for my daughter they brought over a dirty one. So I did have to clean it with my baby wipes. The floor was so covered in food everywhere around the tables it was gross. The staff are clearing plates with one hand and then giving you a drink with the same hand that touched all the plates that were nasty. The prime rib was tasteless and the beef ribs were in edible and if you want to crabs legs you had to dip your hand into the crab water to grab the tongs and the chef wouldn't help you. I suppose I expected a little bit more for the price per person and them to be a little bit more on the ball. Just if you are going here remember it's a fast paced environment and it's not somewhere where you can sit and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"First time I've been here in 10 years the food was not bad but the dim  sum was not good at all I got pop u pay 5 $ for a fountain pop medium glass no refill  maybe in 10 years I'll try again"}
{"text":"Expensive for the food, bloody ceaser did not come with any alcohol and was served in an olive jar."}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to place for buffet dining, we especially enjoy the lunch for the dim sum. The diners are always racing for the pork shumai and egg tarts, which are popular. We've been regulars for years and commend the restaurant for the food quality and great service. My daughter always looks forward to getting a lollipop (or 2) from the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Service was the most redeeming quality of this place, the food was very salty and had so much sauce on things you couldn't taste what you were eating."}
{"text":"I've never been to this restaurant to have a meal, and I never will.  I work in the Recreation Department at a long term care center. I was going to bring some of the residents here for lunch on a Friday. So I called them to let them know I'll be bringing seniors in wheelchairs. They told me not to come because it was their busiest day and they would loose money if we came."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet and good price too. Been there many times. Food is authentic and consistent, and it reminds me of my childhood in China. There is a lot of variety, definately enough to fill you up before you have to repeat dishes. There is an array of steamed buns, dim sum, soups, stir fries, marinated meats/tripe/gizzard etc (my favorite), fruits, and desserts. It is fresh and the sauces are delicious.   We paid $20/person (including tip) for lunch service. Dinner is a little bit more but I can't remember how much exactly (under 30), and it provides crab legs and prime rib. It is a Chinese buffet though, so I would definately recommend the Chinese food over the other options (onion rings, fries, sushi etc). Definately worth a visit for anyone looking for an affordable, delicious and casual way to spend a meal with family and friends."}
{"text":"Funny I like Chinese food. I am from Vancouver you can imagine there are quite a few Chinese Restaurants in Vancouver and there is an easy give away whether the food is good or not. Head counts they say...how many Chinese people do you see in the restaurant before you seat to eat. Many means good very few or none means run for your life lol  I have been to this Buffet place a few times and I have a good george of nice Chinese food coming from Vancouver. I will say it is ok and in Calgary not a whole lot of selections, none that I know off. I have been to the old location and I like the new one better. At the old location my boy throw up all night after our visit. We never bother to go again until the new location. My husband and I had lunch a couple of times and decided to attempt taking the kids there again.   But this time I made sure my boy did not eat anything cold, Hot only, play safe. Services so so. You have to ask for drinks before it is offered. I don't know why, perhaps they think you are there for food.   I decide to go there with a friend I have not seen for years, girls need to catch up on girls talk. I did not like where we were seated. I requested a corner seat because I know we will be chatting and giggling you know girls talk. The service was poor. We had to request for drink tea and juice that took a while. They waiter keep coming by with a dumb question are you done? I just ignored it because we were have such a great time chatting.   Some lady walked by and made a comment. The comment suggested we should hurry up. We looked at each other and ignored it again. When you have a good company it is easy to ignore the not so nice comment. I did not think anything about the whole experience but asked my friend a few days later we both had the same feelings poor service.   I have to be sure. I invited another friend for lunch. This time I was ready to give them a piece of my mind. I came prepared. We over stayed for sure. The service was better. I could not help but notice that they refused some people and allowed some. For a restaurant that is not acceptable. Even though it is close to dinner prep but still these people may have just come from work. What happened to customer first?  They have good selection for sure. Dinner are the best choices. With buffet I would stay with hot food than cold just to be safe.   The service depends on who is on duty at the time."}
{"text":"Pretty good.....got stoned and enjoyed myself.Food was better than most greasy chinese buffets with a pretty good selection."}
{"text":"Today is their grand opening Just reopened in Deerfoot mall by sports check. Bigger more tables and more food than ever.  Great value for every occasion. You can't beat the selection and price. Great staff."}
{"text":"While this buffet has a selection not offered by most others in town, I don't find it worth the high price. It's often too busy to and therefore hard to even get to the items you want. Service is acceptable at best."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I got to a buffet at lunch and expect too much from it, I typically hunt for a long time before I find a buffet I'm willing to return to. I often feel like a buffet will sacrifice quality over quantity. Or skips steps just to get a good price vs consumer. I was pleasantly suprised by this wonderful location.  To start I noticed they had a large selection of food, normally that lends me to be extremely worried that there would be dozens of shortcuts taken to produce so many selections. So I loaded up my Yelp that moment while I waited to be seated. The wait was short, within 30 seconds I was greeted and seated (+1 star) I don't like waiting just to be talked to. This is a easy way to impress me and they did it, on my way to my seat the manager even approached me and greeted me as well, it made me feel noticed. As I was seated I relaxed expecting to have to wait to get my drink before approaching the buffet. To my suprise the server approached immediately, asked what I'd want to drink, and told me to feel free to approach the buffet due to time and politeness (+1star)  Now for the food the good part.   I noticed the selection was huge so I decided to take it in two views noticing they offered non - Chinese food items.   The first time I moved in I moved in like someone on the hunt for Chinese food. The typical madman. Collecting gingerbeef pork and veggies wonton soup. You named it. I enjoyed every bite of the meal, the ginger beef however was not as pleasant as some locations but I still enjoyed, it was a bit softer then im used to. But otherwise they earned another star.   The second time I entered the buffet as someone who was forced to go to  a buffet and didn't like Chinese,  I collected alot of items that were more of a comfortable medium, chicken wings, french fries bacon sausage, that type of stuff. The chicken wings were fabulous, a crisp outside hiding a juicy inside, the only disappointment came from the bacon, it felt a bit older perhaps left on from morning, to chewy and not how I normally experiance it, on a otherwise delicious meal. 1/2 star.  As for the location itself it was pretty bland feeling the atmosphere definitely needed a improvement but the servers always ensured my water was full and asked if I was enjoying my meal  overall work the 4th full star.  It's not a 5 star restraunt but it sure is good. I definitely recommend it and think it's renovation has given it a new larger location to house the biggest crowds. I never ran into a issue of seeing something I wanted and finding out its out of stock until the cooks crank out more."}
{"text":"the best chinese buffet in calgary. great food selection, great service."}
{"text":"Ok before I start this review I must say that I really have no idea what \"bad\" chinese food tastes like. It's so foreign to me that I would never be able to identify a bad bowl of chicken fried rice...secondly, I was starving when I went into this place so maybe that's why I loved it so much.  So one day, my boyfriend and I were driving around and we realized we were literally starving, and we needed food asap. We drove over to the Himalayan - our favourite place - only to find that they close up their lunch buffet at 2:00. It was 1:45 and we didn't want to be \"those people\" who walk into a place and expect food right before they are trying to close up. So after tons of searching, we finally found a buffet (we really wanted a buffet) that was open to 3:30. It was Yangtze and although it was a far venture out there, we were famished...and were desperate for a buffet variety lunch.   Upon arriving at Yangtze we got seated right away. It was busy, however enough tables were open for people to get seated as soon as they arrived. Their selection was very big! All kinds of rice, noodles, sushi, soups, dumplings, salads, sweets...even french fries for people who may not want chinese food. I tried almost everything on the menu. I really liked the food too. Everything was stocked immediately after it was empty so my boyfriend and I went back for seconds and thirds. We were stuffed after, grabbed some dessert (basic stuff like cake, icecream, fruit), and then went to pay. It cost $13.49 per person on Sundays, and I believe I saw cheaper prices for different days of the week. We got our moneys worth I would say, however if I had a choice I would go back on a cheaper day haha.   The servers were also always on top of things (filling up our water, getting rid of our old plates), but they seemed to be preoccupied with that kind of thing that they overlooked sweeping up the floors where people had dropped food and such. The place could use someone to clean things here and there like the blinds, or the floors when they get a bit messy. That was the only thing that had put me off about this place.  Other than that, if you are craving Chinese buffet with a ton of variety and aren't expecting anything 5 star, I would give here a try."}
{"text":"This is our first time in Calgary city and on the road trip, we always try to find Chinese buffet for dinner. I yelped Chinese buffet near where we stay and Buffet Yangtze is on the top list. Friday to Sunday, price is 26.95; regular week day is 23.95. To my surprise, the food choices are more than what we have in Los Angeles, price is fair too. I like the golden crispy teriyaki salmon and my hubby like sweet and sour potato stripes which we don't have these meals back in LA buffet. Also,what impress me most is their washroom is very very clean! We ate a lot tonight and their services are good and fast. Overall, I give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"We went there last night, first time since re-opening.  Very disappointing!  Waited half an hour even though everyone was given a number when we got there.  We were number 10.  However, there were people coming after us who seemed to know the guy calling the numbers for seating, and after a brief conversation with him, got in right away.  Food was mediocre, bland and some tasted downright weird.  Many of the plates were not clean, in fact everything in general did not seem clean."}
{"text":"Never, ever compare this place to Foody Goody! The Buffet Yangtze has become our favorite Chinese buffet, and we don't care about the price as it's well worth it. Friendly, courteous staff.. clean restaurant.. food kept hot and fresh. I think I've tried about every dish they've ever served and I love about 95% of them, especially the fish/seafood selections. My only complaint is that the desserts kind of suck (as they do at all Chinese restaurants,) and the ice cream station doesn't seem too sanitary; there has to be a better way to self-serve ice cream! But I'm not going to have ice cream at a Chinese joint anyway when there's a DQ right near by."}
{"text":"Decent buffet with limited selections. They had 1 whole island with just fried items, a few soup choices, stir fry, desserts, salad bar, and dessert soup. The food was just ok, not the best I've had. Great service though and the place does get packed. Food looks fresh and they refill the items fast."}
{"text":"I have never given a Yelp of despair before, but my daughter did warn us.  She refused to go with us when we went out for dinner.  She'd been the week before  and pronounced the food horrible and the restaurant evidenced the decline by the number of people in the place.  For  over  ten years we've visited the Buffet in it's vairous incarnations and eaten a truly decent array of food.   And it was always busy and bustling.  Last week we went to Yangtze and all three of us were not only disappointed by the food's temperature, taste and freshness, but also the fact we spent more on the buffet than we expected to for a week night.  To it's credit, the restaurant now  has a Teppan for fresh cooking, and the barbeque pork was fairly tasty.  Not sure if we'll venture back, because if our daughter was right, the quality of food was not worth the money we paid."}
{"text":"Honestly not bad for a buffet. Still felt like crap afterwards but I had a serious dim sum craving and left satisfied. Good selection of dim sums at the lunch buffet as well as Western food like potatoes and bacon. The Chinese dishes I tried were decent as well . I don't expect much from a buffett and was pleasently surprised by this one."}
{"text":"This buffet is my family's favorite buffet in the city. It is about $14 per person for lunch service, and in our opinion is the much better option than the dinner, though you don't get prime rib or sushi.  You get a super large selection of dim sum and breakfast options like bacon, sausages and scrambled eggs, a wide assortment of chinese food options and even things like fries and onions, chicken nuggets and wings.   In addition, you get  a salad bar, soup area, sushi, and dessert (3-4 types of ice cream and small cakes). There is even soft shell crab available now! Everything tasted pretty good aside from a tray of homestyle potatoes which were undercooked.   Service staff come around often to take your dirty plates so they don't clutter your table and also to refill your water.   If you like chinese food buffets then you should definitely try this one out, and come early around 11 am to get all the delicious egg tarts!"}
{"text":"The Yangtze Buffet really let me down today (I've eaten there at least 20 times over the years). Buddy and I got there about 11:45 and the buffet was very cold and dim sum selection was markedly poor. I asked buffet attendant about more dim sum and all she could do was giggle and say \"Maybe later.\" This response is offered moments before lunch rush is to begin? Honestly. Prices have also been jacked up a couple buck to $16 since I was last there a few months ago."}
{"text":"Pretty decent selection. Especially if you like seafood. Not the best buffet I have been to though. Restaurant was pretty dirty and your chairs are backed against the table behind yous chair."}
{"text":"Great selection. Some traditional & a lot of North America Chinese items on the buffet. The staff is very pleasant. A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Food Quality: 4/5 Dining Area: 3/5 Parking: 5/5 Service: 1/5 Value: 3/5  The food here is pretty decent for a Chinese buffet in Calgary.  Lots of selection and the fresh tray come out often.  Having said that, the dining area is pretty small for a buffet so you'll have to wait in line to get in if you show up late.  Also, the staff here are RUDE if that matters to you.  The staff are much nicer at places like Asian Buffet but then the food's not as good.  Your call."}
{"text":"Yesterday night was a no colors kinda night. Meaning, all my food was a shade of orange. I swear... buffets are going to be the death of me. I haven't been to one for quite a while, and have been meaning to try out this buffet since it relocated. In my sad attempt to justify coming here, I convinced the bf to walk the long way to the restaurant from the other side of the mall. I don't think doing so made any difference to our overall fitness... The restaurant has its own separate entrance and appeared much larger than its predecessor.   We were seated quickly to a table that was wet, and both the bf and I were concerned if the glasses on our table were clean or not as they were also wet... The restaurant was filled with families with young children. When the bf went to go get his food, there were several children that attempted to play tag around our table and climbed over his chair; I simply glared at them in distaste for the rest of night. The floors never seemed to be cleaned either, as I saw walked past the same large streak of dirty water beside their     The food selection was \"okay\". All the expected \"chinese\" items were there, albeit they weren't refilled regularly (could have just been the fact that we were there at 7pm?). Their attempt at \"japanese\" food made me very sad. The rolls that were available weren't labeled, and they had the oddest combinations ever.. I think one of my rolls had apple salad in it.   Their attempt at prime rib was.. a bloody mess. The slices were way too thick cut, and there was no one to serve it. Their ribs were okay as per the bf, but I looked at them... and they were very burnt; not appetizing looking at all. I did love their shrimp skewers though. I think I had a dozen of them... no need for extra sauce or anything.   Their dessert selection did not impress me at all. During my first round, I saw about 5 selections available, but by my third round there were only two pastries available to choose from. They do have ice cream here... but the ice cream scoops were nasty, they were floating around a milky container of water. Fruit selection wasn't that great either... they had a bountiful amount of honeydew available, and oranges... and lemons. The only non-orange item I ate as the honeydew at the end of my meal.   I got my fill of guilty deep fried pleasures that I would typically not eat. For a total of three rounds, my tummy was filled to the brim. Quality isn't that great, but you get what you pay for though."}
{"text":"Having not been to a Chinese buffet in years, I decided to give this one a try before doing a round of shopping at the adjacent Wal-Mart. I came in pretty hungry, ready to devour a small bowl of soup and two plates of food. Buffets are not the healthiest method of eating out due to the food being so greasy. You also end up eating a variety of different meats and, more often than not, overeating is the norm. But as with anything, moderation is key! When you're craving a plate of Chinese, especially a combo, buffets can be the most satisfying way to go if you're starving since you get all the variety you want.  Walking in around dinner hour, I noticed the place was pretty packed. The seating inside is endless, but some of tables are a little close to each other, making it uncomfortable to squeeze through when diners are seated. The service was delightful; my server came by on several occasions to refill my water, pick up empty plates, and bring me chopsticks. All of the staff was friendly and smiling. The washrooms were clean and tidy, with no smells or stains. Price-wise, you get what you pay for - dinner is $24ish per person, while lunch is about $16ish, both before taxes and gratuity.   Compared to all other buffets I've visited in my life, I have to say this one had some of the best and extensive variety, by far! Four soups to choose from, as well as four dim sum dishes. The rolls are soft and doughy, perfect with the bean filling inside. Wonton Soup, one of my favourites, was the best I've had at a buffet. The pork wontons were a good size, with no crunch or gross bits inside, but rather a soft ground pork and light wonton wrappers, with a broth that wasn't oily. I wanted to do seconds of soup, but I was worried I would fill up too quick before getting to the meats and sides. Though I didn't partake in any greens, all of the abundant salads and fixings looked fresh as can be.  The pork ribs, chicken dishes and all of the seafood stood out the most, as far as quality and consistency. The seafood didn't taste as if it had been sitting around not unlike at some buffets where you get a stench walking through the fish section. The crab was one of my favourites; you really can't beat having all that variety plus crab, with how expensive market prices are and Alberta being over a thousand kilometres from the ocean. The pork ribs were rich but so flavourful with Asian flavours. Some downsides: curry chicken with veggies was flavourless; the chicken in the chicken balls was hard as a rock; the squid was tough. But on the plus side, they had an amazing fresh roast, with the carver ready and willing to cut up a slice of two at your convenience. The sweet treat and ice cream selections were more than enough to satisfy any palette, but I didn't indulge so I can't judge the taste.  This is a solid place to take your family out once every few months for a fatty, carb-loaded meal, especially if they're craving Chinese - Buffet Yangtze has most selections available. It's unfortunate it's too far out for most people, but it's worth stopping in here if you're at Deeefoot City or heading up to CrossIron Mills."}
{"text":"First time visit and for lunch. I have to say, the food was fresh and delicious! I loved all the dim sum dumplings and chicken wings and the egg rolls were to die for. They even had a huge pan of bacon! I did miss that there was no salt n pepper squid but maybe that's an evening dish.   Restaurant was very clean and the servers were quick to refill drinks, very rare in a buffet.  I'm so sad I never went here sooner but will make sure I rectify that."}
{"text":"As far as Chinese buffets go this one is fairly good.  The selection is decent and the food tastes good.  I like how they have seafood and sushi during dinner.. oh yeah and salmon sashimi as well.  I think I eat about $20 of sashimi every time I go there.  They probably hate me by now :)  I would've given them 4-stars had they have cleaner washrooms and a better dessert selection.  The service is good, always filling up your water (we all know why :)  and friendly.  We ending up going 20-30min before closing once and they didn't put anything away until we were totally done eating.  This was a big deal for me.  ---EDIT--January 26th, 2015---  They recently relocated to the opposite side of the mall.  In regards to my last statement in my original review, I'd have to retract it.  The last time we went was 40 minutes before closing and they didn't want to seat us.  It was 9:20pm and they were already starting to put items away.  Not a big deal and it doesn't deserve a star reduction but I thought I'd mention this for those who are thinking of a late supper."}
{"text":"Still love this buffet. Price is now 14.49 for an adult for lunch. The desserts are great, there is sushi, soup, salad and a wide variety of hot items. Just wish I had more time at lunch! Egg tarts are great and so are the rice glutinous fried balls - sweet, with a tiny smidge of red bean paste in the middle, so fresh, warm and delicious. Staff is friendly and the restaurant lets natural light in, lots of room and a good place for a conversation."}
{"text":"For $24 a head (the new price) Yangtze offers all you can eat, old, standard takeout food in a pretty nice setting.  Food was standard Panda Express faire, of below average quality, at an exorbitant price. Variety was lacking, as there was heaping quantities of orange chicken and BBQ ribs, but very few exotic options -- lots of skewers and sweet and sour, few mapo tofu, garlic eggplant, etc. Food was nearing 3-star quality in terms of preparation, but wasn't very fresh. Was sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time, and the condensation from the food was constantly dripping back into the trays. Fruit selection was pretty limited; just watermelon and orange slices. Sashimi salmon looked quite old and was wrapped in plastic. This all sounds abysmal, but normal fried rice is still tasty, so it still didn't taste AWFUL.  Service was okay. Plates were taken reasonably often, but dishes were often speckled with food and/or wet.  The most redeeming quality was the decor. Pretty clean interior, no tacky decorations, good standard white tablecloths. Bathroom was not the mess many buffets have it in, and had reasonably thick and soft toilet paper. Decor was probably 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of mine & Rob's favorite \"on occasion\" places to go. Because it's located at Deerfoot Mall, and we live in downtown, we don't go much more than maybe once a year. The first time we went, we loved every second of it, but the last time we went in late 2010, we noticed an \"off\" taste to the Sweet & Sour sauce, and we both felt pretty queasy for a few hours afterward. We still very much like the place itself, so we agreed we'd likely go again this Springtime.  They have a dazzling decor style, and I'd say the waitress who dealt with us was pretty nice. I find the fishtank at the front of house to be appealing, and seing as how I was born under the \"sign of the Fish\", that alone drew me in for a closer look.  All in all, it's a pretty great place to go for a Chinese Lunch or Dinner buffet, and there is quite an extensive variety for every pallette :)"}
{"text":"I haven't been into this restaurant for like 10 years. Last Friday me and 2 coworkers got together and had an awesome meal and great company as Christmas is coming soon. The lay out is almost like vegas buffet. The bar is pretty got live fish tank. The manager is so friendly and so Uber nice.  The menu...holy cow... got lots of seafood( shrimp, oyster, fish, crab, calm) different chicken entree, omg the salt n pepper squid....I ate so much!  The shrimp skewer! Number number num... Of course salad, sushi, roast beef cooked to your liking.  Downside, sweets not as appetizing.  But who needs it your full by the time your done. The fruits...omg so sweet. The keep on filling the dishes. If it's empty it doesn't stay empty too long  But because it's so busy get as much food as you like...I mean your fave ones.  For 22.95 on weekends still good price for the food they serve I think it's worth it. I think I ate like 2 orders full of salt and pepper squid...hihihi. Ice cream was good there were 3 flavors I only grabbed mango n chocolate.  They also have soup. It's a definite something to check out.  Since deerfoot mall is in major reno. They relocated...they are now right across Walmart.  Close to sport check. Yah...I have to walk all thru out the mall. One last thing ...don't eat anything if u know your going there...get your monies worth which isn't hard...hihi"}
