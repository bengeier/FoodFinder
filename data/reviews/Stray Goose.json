{"text":"Great beer selection.  Bartender was very friendly as well as the owner who poped in for a while."}
{"text":"No value, no service. $20 for a burger beer and tip. Burger was average, a bit greasy. The barmiad is good looking but unless you are a regular, don't expect service. Two old guys kept her at their end of the bar with bad sexual innuendos and she ignored everone else."}
{"text":"Love the Goose!    The service, the food and the staff are great!    I hosted a birthday party there for my sister recently and they went above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 930 pm on a Friday night.. was told by a waitress that part of the grill was shut down and she did not elaborate.  We were going to leave but our drinks arrived.  Diet coke was flat. 5 people at the bar and felt like we were being rushed out.   Won't be back with all the places in Avon now.  We went to Zzs instead for good bar food"}
{"text":"Terribly ran spot. Not one person working there has an inch of restaurant knowledge. The latest review where the man heard the bartender trash talking him is the norm. That would be Monica. Food is garbage. Stored in an unsanitary manner. They can't properly execute food. Just a matter of time till the doors shit for good. It would be a favor to the city of Avon"}
{"text":"Have tried this place twice in the last couple of months.  Service was okay, but everything else was poor.  Food was lousy and very over priced.  We tried the wraps, sandwiches, lobster bisque, and a pasta dish.  None of which I would recommend. The boneless wings were decent.  We gave it a second chance, but not getting a third out of us."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in tonight for a beer on the nice patio and decided to eat as well.  I can't comment on the entire menu but, we both had a 8oz patty melt with fries and it was DELICIOUS!  Juicy, nice cut of meat, perfectly grilled onions and excellent fries.  Yes, it was pricey for a local pub, $37.15 for two sandwiches, one fry and five long neck Bud Lights but, the patty melts were well worth the $8.99 apiece.
     Our waitress was great, Rachel was her name, and for the second day on the job, you could have never known it.  Service was prompt, friendly and she kept bringing a new frosted glass with each beer. Not a big thing, but it showed an attention to detail that was very nice.  Service isn't often this nice at other local establishments. We would consider going again, but the beer is little pricey for just a local pub."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love the Goose! We usually go here to drink when we want a nice, quiet, rather cozy spot to hang out and chill at. The bartenders are good and make good recommendations, strong drinks, and friendly conversation. Always a good place to go for a game of pool."}
{"text":"Came to listen to a local band and eat dinner. The band Outta Dodge was very good.
Unfortunately the Stray Goose was a different story. From horrible service to a very dry stuffed burger, and a belligerent male bartender the dining experience was awful.
Needless to say, I will never return!"}
{"text":"Had a nice time at Stray Goose in Avon again! Nice change from your chain establishments ! Harry is a very personable bartender.  I feel they need to draw more attention to their business by having theme parties like 80's, 70's. Stop in and see what you are missing by staying near Avon Commons"}
{"text":"Comfortable clean spot,  a little over priced on their tastless food.  Keno, lottery, pool tables, roomy and a smoking patio."}
{"text":"I put $5 in the jukebox and the bartender soon thereafter parked it at the jukebox and has thus far bumped 6 songs in front of mine. Understandable if there is an empty bar, but not if paying customers are putting money into the jukebox. Also had to wait for beers a while as a result of him being parked said jukebox."}
{"text":"Have to say this is one of my favorite spots! I try to stop weekly and try different martinis! The bartenders made me every foo foo martini until I found one I fell in love with! The staff is always friendly and ready to laugh. The owner pops in and out and always says hi to everyone. It's like a little family up there! The manager Ryan does a fantastic job! Shaun, Kristen, and Monica are AWESOME bartenders! I'm not a huge foodie, but I have had the fried cheese, which I love! And the pizza! Love the pizza with bacon! The jukebox is new and never too loud. They always have some kind of music playing. And of course keno! This is a great local spot. Not to pricey and worth adding into a date night rotation!"}
