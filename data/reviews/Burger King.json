{"text":"With $1.00 Icees (cherry, coke or mixed) and .50 cent vanilla ice cream cones, this is a great place to treat children to something \"special.\"  The indoor play area is clean and never crowded.    BK also offers veggie burgers but make sure to ask them to hold the mayo if you do not want your sandwich swimming in it."}
{"text":"So on Tuesday December 11th, my dad had some errands to run and I had naturally agreed since on occasion I don't like staying home alone. So we were off running here and there for errands and I had a coupon for a buy one get one free whopper. We don't live far from this location  and we ran the errands needed in this side and it was about lunch time and my dad's like \"hey if you still have that coupon we can eat lunch here\" and I said sure I mean two whoppers for the price of one....thats a good deal there. We walked in and we were greeted with a smile and I felt like a VIP with how I was treated. The employees even came over and asked us if everything was going fine and if we needed anything.   This is one Burger King I will be coming back to in the future, even though I don't eat out on a daily basis"}
{"text":"I went yesterday and the lady at the drive thru was really nice. She kept her cool even after I got a little rude because I thought she wasn't listening. She continued to smile and gave us everything we needed. I usually have too ask for condiments but not thus time, she was on top of everything. I wish I would've got her name so that I could give her a shout out."}
{"text":"this place is a mess.  people were yelling in the kitchen and not cooking food. the drive thru was backed up with no food going out.  I asked where the manager was and was told she was in the back yelling and not working along with the rest of the help . the only one working was Haley.  I asked her what her name was. the garage cans were overflowing and it wasn't clean."}
{"text":"We just stopped in this BK for quick dinner. The place was spotless!! Employees were very courteous and made sure our order was fresh and even brought it to our table. I rarely eat fast food, but I surely will revisit this store! The new crispy chicken was great!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. I paid $5.34 for a burger that was so cold I would be skeptical to believe a rumor that it was ever warm. I brought it back, got my money back from a manager that didn't seem remotely abashed, as if it was normal routine at this Burger King on Bell Rd and 7th St."}
{"text":"The only reason I go here is because it's the closest fast food dispensary within walking distance. Having said that, I still try to avoid it where possible.  The service always seems to be slow even though there is never really much volume and the clientele consists primarily of Sheridan students.  What I find redeeming about BK is the daily meal deals which used to be $3.99 but have recently jumped up to over $4."}
{"text":"This is the slowest drive thru in the world! So if you're in a rush I'd go somewhere else. This is the closest thing to my house on the way home from errands sometimes. So I stop, BUT only if I have time."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and every time it seems they are short staff and the tables are all dirty. The staff that helped me seemed like they were having the worst day ever. Messed up my order 2 of the 3 times."}
{"text":"Staff always helpful, place looks clean.  When ya gotta have Burger King, this is a good one!"}
{"text":"Food was good as I had ordered,  nothing fancy, quick and easy."}
{"text":"I never usually go to fast food, but a little over a week ago, I decided to stop somewhere to get a quick bite to eat and take care of some work. I was met at the door by an employee named Dylan who opened the doors while I was struggling to hold onto all my papers. I ordered a couple burgers. Nothing crazy. And an Oreo mint shake that he recommended, which was pretty good. He brought my food to me and I've never had such great service before. 5 stars for this location for sure"}
{"text":"Wait time sucks. They keep dealing with drive thru and not the customers inside. We are all customers and the orders need to be processed in order.   Do go here if you do t ha e an hour to wait for a cheese burger"}
{"text":"Even though we had coupons for free burgers and fries and a discount on big Macs at McDonald's, when dad and I saw this Burger King, we decided it was worth paying for food. We ended up giving them a confusing order at the drive-through, but the lady who took our order did a great job sorting everything out.  I have to say that the french fries they gave me are the best I've ever tasted... Ever. Did I mention ever?! They were hot, fresh, perfectly crispy on the outside, perfectly salted, and soft on the inside.  The frappe that I got was perfect, as was dad's milkshake.  The burgers were much better than McDonald's could ever hope for, and better than what we usually get from Burger King. Beingin the poorer part of Phoenix, I expected pretty crappy service and food quality, but the whole experience has been exceptional.  My only complaint, is that my Cinnabon was cold when I got it. They should've  heated it up.  I would definitely recommend this location to anyone who's nearby. Id even go out of my way for it!"}
{"text":"I have an INTENSE hatred for people telling me to pull around the drive thru and wait for my food to be ready. To me, this means, \"move along loser, you're inconveniencing us; even though you paid us, and waited in line for everyone else, you need to get out of line, and go wait till we're not busy enough to bother bringing your (typically cold) food out to you. That said, when people tell me to do this (typically happens at this Burger King), I put the car in park and tell them politely that I'll wait. This freaks them out, and they practically insist I move because I'm holding everyone else up behind me. I'm not trying to be a dick; I don't order 30 burgers at the drive thru. They make the BK Big Fish sandwich fresh and it takes an extra 2 minutes (yes I timed it). They're just trying to keep their drive thru times down because they're monitored and penalized if they are too high. O.K... Rant out of the way, I have to say that when I go in, everyone is polite and helpful. The restaurant is always clean, and quiet. The food is ALWAYS fresh, and hot. You can order lunch early in the morning, and the soda is never flat. This is why the store gets 2 stars instead of 1. Honestly, I'd rate the in store experience a 4/5 and the drive thru experience a 1/5, because they are incapable of understanding drive thru orders without repeating them 2-4 times for each item, and you can FORGET about asking for details on items. Anything you ask about, they just add to your order without explanation, even though you may not want it. Add to it, the above issue, with the lack of give-a-damn for the drive thru customers, and we have a pretty \"meh\" store. Step up the drive thru customer service Burger King!"}
{"text":"Worst experience in my life dennis the manager the time is 8:20pm horrible and the girl doing drive rude and ignorant the fat one i couldnt read her tag worst experience now i know why you have 2 stars get a new staff"}
{"text":"Yay the morning rush! No, there's barely anyone here and no cars coming through, yet the couple of us that are waiting have been waiting for over 10 min. It's called fast food. The place didn't smell too clean and the floor definitely wasn't. It was the 8 a.m. hour. The cashier and the manager were both scooping tater tots and handling people's food without gloves. Straight from the register to open food and back. Yuck."}
{"text":"By far the worst fast food experience I have ever had. I even gave this location numerous chances, as I love BK. But each time I am more disappointed. Time spent in the drive through was never less than 10 minutes, and that's only if they acknowledged my presence before 5 minutes of waiting at the speaker. My order has never been right, the workers are rude, and the place is filthy. We decided to go in today to order, due to my previous drive through fiascos, and we were as equally disappointed with the inside service as the outside. This location needs a complete overhaul of employees or to be shut down altogether. If I could rate negative stars, that's what this place would receive."}
{"text":"This isn't five stars because Burger King is some amazing gourmet experience. However, this Burger King of all Burger Kings is 5 stars. This is one of the cleanest fast food places I have ever been inside. Also, the manager is the nicest guy and gives the best service. Seriously. I have been to fancy pantsy restaurants and not received such outstanding treatment. So don't laugh, not until you've been and know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"I was passing by and came here for some comfort food (ie. poutine) on a cold day. Regrettably, the poutine was mediocre.  The cheese curds were excellent, but I think the fries might have been old. Perhaps they weren't fully cooked? Whatever the problem, the fries had that cardboard taste; like they had been frozen for too long and cooked anyway.  The price was a higher than what I expected - it was as much as some of the burger combos. For the amount of gravy, cheese, and fries I got, it wasn't worth the price. Service in this place is just like any other fast food joint.  For the taste and value this isn't a very good option. You'd be better off going to other places that add more ingredients to the product, and are more concerned about putting out a great product. I should have kept walking past Burger King and saved my taste buds and money."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed, first of all the lady working the drive through needs 8 hours to try an figure out what I'm saying. And I don't know why but my root beer tastes watery and not fizzy like a normal root beer overall. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I am glad to know this place has opened under new management. Before this place closed, I would have probably given this joint 2 stars or less. The place was always dirty and would give me the impression that if they don't care about cleanliness in the workplace, how would that translate to their food?  Now that this Burger King is back on its feet, it really seems to have made the turn for the better. The staff is attentive to detail, they are friendly, and fast. The place is also a lot cleaner. I really hope this trend continues."}
{"text":"Ive been to a lot of burger kings in different cities, but this one is by far the worst one ive ever been to. They didnt even get my order correct and gave me a cheeseburger instead of the bacon king I ordered. As for the taste of the burgers, the pattys are disgusting and have a rotten taste to them. They also are soggy and drenched in grease. Now ive been to other burger kings and I know what a burger typically tastes like from there...and i am super disappointed with this experience. Would definitely advise against even if you are craving a burger"}
{"text":"Now I see why all of the Burger King restaurants in this area have bad reviews. The one in Kings Mountain shut down. I drove into the drive thru late at night about 11:30. Had to wait for over 15 minutes just to get a large order of onion rings. I pulled out to the light and looked into the bag. Saw an order of fries. Drove back into the drive thru, told the speaker that I got the wrong order and was told to pull up. After waiting another 15 minutes, the girl hands me a bag with an attitude and doesn't apologize for the wait or wrong order. I look into the bag and see onion rings so once again I pull out to the light. I try to eat one while waiting at the light. All of them were smashed and burnt. Couldn't even eat one. Tasted like they had been under the heat lamp since they opened. Had to throw the whole bag away instead of waiting in line for another 15 minutes. Burger King is now on my list of places to never return to. Go to Wendy's."}
{"text":"Der schlechteste Burger King den ich je besucht habe... Unmotiviertes Personal, keine Ahnung von nichts und arrogant bis sonstwas.. Teilweise fehlte mehrmals essen, bzw.war kalt.Diskussionen kamen dann auch vom Personal.. HALLO??"}
{"text":"Never had an issue here. Always well and quickly made food. Shakes are just ok though. Always melty."}
{"text":"When I pulled into the parking lot the place just opened. So it was empty. My order came up quick and away I went. I try to stop there on my morning drive to grab a bite."}
{"text":"I waited 20 mins for my food , I approached the counter and they forgot to put my order in! The managers response was \"I don't know what happened\" I'm never going back"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money.  Ordered my whopper special and when I got it home it was wrong.  Wasn't going to drive back just tossed it.  The frys were cold and greasy.  A waste of 8 bucks."}
{"text":"It's a burger king, so I won't say much about the food. It was just what you would expect out of a Burger King.   I don't normally review  fast food places, but people should know that something is off at this Burger King.   Okay, first of all, I walked in, and went to use the restroom after several hours on the road. Well. An employee made the very odd decision to prop the door open. While I was \"mid-flow.\" It's hard for men to stop urinating when they start, especially if they have to go really bad. So, I was standing there, whizzing away and, just to repeat, the employee came and propped the door open. Why would they do such a thing? Let's just throw privacy out the window.   Making matters worse, a little girl was confused by the open door, and must have assumed it was the little girl's room, and walked in for a second. So, great, having my genitals out in the presence of a child. Just lovely. I growled/shouted \"Wrong Bathroom\" at the kid, and seemingly terrified,  she ran away, and fell on her butt on the way out.   Even worse, as I was washing my hands I heard her mom start screaming at her for the mistake.   I was a little shaken at this point, and sort of stumbled up to the ordering counter to get my spicy chicken sandwich. Nobody was serving me, as I stood there trying to not look annoyed, and then the little girl with her mom walked to the other register, and were promptly served by a dwarf working at the other counter.   Look, I'm glad that Burger King is cool with employing Dwarves, I'm sure it's not easy for \"little people\" to find gainful employment. But come on lady, I wasn't trying to insult you when I stood at the wrong counter, I just couldn't see you.   When I adjusted to her cash register (heaven forbid she come to my register or alert me to her presence), the cashier was kind of unpleasant. I hope nobody spit on my food.   Oh yeah, the Spicy chicken sandwich was fine, it tasted the same way it would at any other burger king."}
{"text":"We have gone here in the past year four times and they are always out of ice cream. It doesn't matter the time of day. This last week we went to get ice cream and food. Ordered chicken tenders they were out. OK can we have four cheeseburgers no we are out of buns. Well what can we get, whatever you want. We just left after all that."}
{"text":"I got my food inside and took off really quick and forgot my wallet on the counter as soon as they realized it was there they put it behind the counter. In my frantic search for it I called up the Burger King and the manager made me give a detailed description of my wallet which made me feel good like she was protecting my information. When I came in to get it she was very truthful saying she opened it to see my I'd to make sure it was me picking it up. She was very nice and helpful and I'm glad they are so thuro in there lost and found. And on top of that my food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Good bk food. Slow service. Drive through is a 10 min stop even if your the only one in line. Always feels like i am bugging the person at the window."}
{"text":"this place has to be the worst my wife went here yesterday evening to order our daughter some food and made them wait 40 freakin minutes ARE YOU SERIOUS BURGER KING?? you made child wait 40 fucking minutes to eat??? and on top of that everyone else seemed to be getting their food on time and all the freeloaders are stealing sodas with big gulp cups from 711 these have got to be the sorryest bunch of assholes that should not be in the resturant biz and the manager was just as useless for shame"}
{"text":"Burnt chicken fries that I would be embarrassed to serve to anyone but they can have three stars because they did replace them and the other food we got was good. I wouldn't say the service was great but it wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"Mir kommt es oft so vor, als würden im BK Stade Zutaten weggelassen oder geändert werden. Jedenfalls schmecken die Burger meistens anders als in anderen Filialen und damit meine ich nicht besser.   Vielleicht sollte sich die BK-Zentrale mal darum kümmern. Ich meide den Laden jedenfalls schon länger."}
{"text":"Food isn't any better nor worst than any other burger king. This location, however, is extremely expensive. It costs around $9 for a double whopper."}
{"text":"RANT:  Madison, get more fast food.    I don't know how all these kids got through undergrad without a steady supply of fast food places.  My college town was saturated with them.  And it wasn't like an obesity epidemic had been unleashed in the student ghetto.  I guess if you're a certain type, you'd think it's great that Madison forces kids to stay off the big mac meal plan.  I guess it probably is.  But it's certainly a hell of a lot less fucking fun.  Responsibility comes on at an earlier age for badgers.  It's got to when the weather conspires to kill you 3/4ths of the year."}
{"text":"We pull up to the drive thru and we waited a good 5 minutes before we even had someone say something to us over the intercom. when the lady finally said something she said \"do you need help\" very rudely. when I got to the window the lady at the window had an attitude with me when I asked her one simple question. they made the coffees with WAY to much vanilla, when we asked for ketchup she didn't even bother to put it in the bag for us. we tried calling and EVEN THE MANAGER WAS RUDE!!!!! this location has the worst customer service ever. they are also very slow at what they do. I wouldn't even give them a star if I wasnt required too."}
{"text":"I was starving for breakfast, it was 10:34 when I rolled into the drive thru (thanks to the idiot driving 10 miles under the speed limit and me being stuck behind him on 215). I'm from the East Coast where BK does breakfast on Sundays until 11 am, thought I was safe. However when I got into the drive thru, they informed me that they were no longer serving breakfast. However, Nicole (from Kenmore, NY) the drive thru girl went and asked the cooks if they could make me a breakfast burrito and they very sweetly did. The burrito was delicious and the service was even better. So I want to thank the staff and especially Nicole and the young man also at the window. They really went above and beyond the call of service and I will certainly be heading up to this BK again and will be calling corporate to let them know that they have got some great employees at this store."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous they DO NOT honor 10 nuggets for $1.49 as advertised on TV!!!  Food took awhile but was hot. Guy taking my order seemed dead inside."}
{"text":"The woman in charge is very unpleasant to be around, food Is alright but the service made the visit terrible. Needs better management."}
{"text":"Came through the drive through and ordered a 5 for 4 with a Mello Yellow, a ten piece nuggets, and a medium onion rings. They got the order all wrong, and when we went back the lady unapologetically said that they don't do the 5 for 4 anymore, so instead she gave us something else instead of correcting us when we ordered. It seems like none of the employees care at all, and it shows. This Burger King messes up our order just about every time we go there, so take that into account if you're on a time crunch or don't feel like going back to get the correct food."}
{"text":"So the food is typical Burger King, but the service is stellar. Yes, at a fast food place, it matters. It was nice to be greeted with a smile. The coffee was strong and hot and the place was very clean."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of BK, I have held pretty true to my Micky Ds however the chicken fries with multiple dipping sauce options are a great snack.  They are always advertising apple fries for the kids but this location never seems to have any in stock."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a zero. I ordered a coffee (first mistake) at 11am and not only did it take forever to get my drink but it was room temperature at best. I know BK is not known for its coffee but I expect a little more than this"}
{"text":"Went here after dinner time to grab a snack after my cousins birthday party. First of all, they were out of chicken fries, my favorite menu item. I instead got a 10 piece nugget. I had to wait 10 minutes for them because they needed to \"fry the grease\" for their chicken nuggets and the fries weren't cooked yet. They almost gave us the wrong order. The food was ok, they just need better and more efficient staff. I guess I have to write more to make this review count, so...   Overall, food ok, staff not so ok."}
{"text":"Don't trust anything you order through the drive-thru.  Burgers will be the wrong size for what you ordered, double patties will be single patty.  The last order, I had a BBQ bacon burger that was litterally a soup of BBQ and I had to wipe off the bun and patty from the overload of sauce. They've burned the nuggets then double bagged them and I didn't find out 'till I got home. You can get food here but treat it like a sketchy drug deal, and pull everything out of the wrapper and inspect it before you drive home or you'll get burned.  The service reps are nice and polite but there is no consistent quality control on the food that is wrapped and given to the customer."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst BK I have been to. I had to wait 15 minutes for chicken nuggets to only receive them room temperature. Think about your management and hourly employees that had no sense of urgency to service customers. The cashier took orders but no one was getting food. Very sad  I"}
{"text":"Just down the street. Not much to be expected cause it's fast food. Mostly go through the drive thru. Gotta say I do like the Cinnabons they sell there now."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst Burger King I've ever been to ever the service was horrible and after waiting 30 minutes for my food they didn't even give me my drinks and I was so fed up with waiting for so long for two meals that I just left will never go to this Burger King if I don't have to!"}
{"text":"So I stopped by this Burger King to grab some food really quick, the slowest service I have ever gotten at a \"FAST FOOD\" joint. We got up to the order board within a few minutes but then spent almost 20 minute just getting up to the counter then had to wait another few minute at the window. The gal at the window still never acknowledge us or even turned around, after waiting a little longer we finally left because it was a completely waste of time!"}
{"text":"terrible service, terrible food, bad attitude. drive another 5 miles to watson for a bite to eat"}
{"text":"Though it is fast food, I have enjoyed their breakfast in the past. Today we wasted $13. It was probably one of the worst breakfast meals I have ever had. The biscuits were cold hard and stale, the croissants were burnt, the pancakes tasted like flour goo, the sausage was over cooked, and the eggs were just gross. Steer clear of this location."}
{"text":"The food was good but the guy Sam who took our order was very rude. Probably won't be visiting this Burger King again"}
{"text":"Burger King (Rocky River location) has very poor customer service; for example, the drive-thru window service frequently gets the orders incorrect.  In addition, the WAIT at the drive-thru is continually LONG.  Clearly, Burger King doesn't formally train their employees as to being courteous w/ customers, as evidenced by the staff at this location.  It is poorly run, most likely because of poor management.  Do yourself a favor & travel a coupla blocks in either direction on Center Ridge in order to purchase your food in a timely maner @ Chik-Fil-A (a far superior fast food restaurant), McDonald's et al."}
{"text":"I was the only one going through the drive-thru so I placed my order and drove to the window. The lady handed me my bag, even before taking my money. I thought, cool, fast service. I ordered a Whopper Jr. no onion and fries. When I got home I took off the top bun to check to make sure there was no onion. No onion, but the rest of the burger looked like crap. The lettuce was not leaves, but clumps of an ending of a lettuce head. Then the tomato was the size of a 50 cent piece, and yellow. The meat was small. The burger tasted like crap. There is something wrong with their pickles too. An off putting sour taste to them. I only ate half and threw it away-not knowing if this old burger they found laying around was going to make me sick. I went to this location a couple of months ago, and it wasn't very good, and I thought I would give them another chance. Never again. Low quality food at this location. Beware."}
{"text":"What is wrong with this place? Seems like it creates a uproar in the kitchen just ordering a cheesburger (which I never got). I'll never go there again."}
{"text":"This is the second time there's been hair in my food. I mean come on. Once was to many times. Twice is terrible. The cashier lady is very short with people and pretty rude."}
{"text":"Having won a free small frapee from the \"Family Food\" giveaway at another Burger King, I decided to go inside the Sun Prairie location to cash it in. This was after I waited for almost twenty minutes at the drive-through, even after the order taker told me she'd be with me in, \"just a second.\" Inside the lobby, I was met by a scene of dirty tables, slow service, and a floor littered with a surprising ammount of plastic gloves. When I finally made it to the counter, I was amazed to learn that it is somehow possible to take my order without saying a single word to me, and then simply walking away without even handing me a reciept. Perhaps it was this same top-notch service and accuracy that caused another customer there to have to come back not once, not twice, but THREE times because they made his food wrong. At this point, my instincts said to leave, but my honor required that I stick with it to the bitter end. But when I finally got the free frapee, I was saddened to say that it was not worth the wait. If you value your ability to eat at Burger King more than your time, I would suggest staying in your car at this location and living in blissful ignorance. As for me, it'll be a while before I have it my way again."}
{"text":"Location #4833, Order #69 - Tue Jan 02 2018 3:29PM. I ordered a large double whopper meal, no mayo and no tomatoes. She read back my order perfectly and my receipt even confirms this. What I received instead was a single whopper with extra mayo and tomatoes... what? I hate you. Why did you steal my damn money burger king?   This location has an obvious trend of stealing from their customers, I'm curious if its just an ongoing scheme of theirs to save some money. Providing less food but charging for it is a double profit for them, they steal cash and save on their weekly food delivery.   Who investigates this kind of crime? The better business bureau? Either way don't go here, they're garbage and they couldn't care less."}
{"text":"I love Burger King but,I will never go to the one on Northfield Rd. Again.I order 5 cheeseburgers no mustard of course they put mustard on them.The cook dropped a whole rack of buns and he picked them up and put them back like nothing ever happened When I brought it to the managers attention she acted like it was no big deal.the employees were telling her they weren't dropping fresh fries she acted scared they were talking all stupid to her she did nothing.The manager had no backbone just let's her crew say and do what they want in front of customers I work in fast food and we would be terminated for acting and talking the way they did.i will never go to this Burger King ever again."}
{"text":"They are open later than other BK in the area which is very convenient - my order was accurate and fresh."}
{"text":"Ordered my food they repeated it to me. Looked like I had everything had everything in it. Well at least looked like I did. Opened my burger to find out was the wrong one. Payed more then what the food they gave me. So pissed to get home to find out I had the wrong food. How hard is it to give the correct food! Asked for a double bacon whopper with cheese no onions or pickles and I got a single with no cheese with onions and pickles. Horrible guys pay attention."}
{"text":"This is the worst Burger King I have ever been to in my life they have the worst service here worst drive-through service they always take forever on the food and don't even answer the drive-through machine a lot of the time I literally had a call and place my order over the phone because they never picked up The drive-through machine I was in the drive-through maybe 20 minutes there was only 2 cars I had in front of me and one behind me"}
{"text":"The worst Burger King! Try to give an establishment a chance to rectify a problem but they have gotten orders wrong, forgot to give you everything you pay for on more than one occasion. I blame the apathetic management who don't seem to train workers properly and have no standards. Not expecting much except common courtesy and getting what I paid for or making it right. Then after the final time and speaking to assistant Mgr Fernando they agree to refund my $ for missing meal....and I was buying breakfast too! Next day asst Mgr says she cant. Gives me the district office # but conveniently leaves off a digit. No more and now going to McD, Carl's anywhere but never a Burger King again."}
{"text":"Ein etwas anderes BK Resturant!Hier ist alles etwas anders,das Publikum,das Personal und leider auch das Essen.Sollte es in der Systemgastronomie nicht eigentlich so sein,das es überall Gleich schmeckt?Hier ist das Essen oft Kalt und dazu nocht sehr Trocken. Ich fahre jetzt lieber daran vorbei und esse bei anderen BK Resturants"}
{"text":"Service was terrible, they insisted on pulling me around (maybe to cheat their customer-wait timer? who knows).  After I politely said I preferred to wait for my food at the window,  I got an order with stone cold fries, patties that looked like they were dragged through the grease trough, a single tiny tomato endcap on my burger and best of all, they conveniently tore off the 'online survey' reference number from my receipt (which i later learned prevents me from complaining to corporate).    Bleh, terrible all around; definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Worst fast food service in the world! Burger King we were at your location just before noon today 5/25/14.  Seriously the girl at the  drive through shouldn't be working in the customer service industry.  It took her 3 times to get the order right and she was rood the whole time.  She asked my wife to repeat herself three time the got snippy with my wife each time.    Don't go there the food is under cooked. They don't speak to you like you are an important customer let alone a human.  I will  listen to the reviewer who said go down the road to Wendy's.    Keep your under cooked burgers BK"}
{"text":"Slowest \"fast\" food joint evvvvvveerrrrrrrr.  Come witness how the unmotivated, understaffed team build your burgers at snail pace. Should be renamed to burrrrrggggeeeerrrrrrr kkkkk k k k iingggggggggggggggg."}
{"text":"Ordered a bacon king, and got on my flight and guess whats missing BACON. THANKS A-HOLES"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Always forget something in the order, and then try to charge you AGAIN for what THEY FORGOT. This location would do so much better if they got someone who was even a TINY BIT EDUCATED to work there, but apparently that is FAR TOO MUCH to ask for."}
{"text":"They have never screwed up my order and the people that work there have always been super nice."}
{"text":"I've gone here 5 times and they've fucked my order up Every. Single. Time. Without fail. Their reliability lies in fucking up orders, they got that on lock. I ordered chicken fries on two separate occasions and I received Bacon-Topped Bullshit Burgers instead. Just pretty awful overall. I would give them a zero-star review if it was possible."}
{"text":"The worst burger king I ever been to ! I love burger king and the wackest one is by my house (this one). Its empty for a reason and the employees seem careless. Service is slow  even if your the only customer. Food isnt fresh . Shameful."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Burger King since I became carb conscious and needless to say... The Halloween Whopper was not worthy of a cheat day meal.  French fries cold... Food was generally cold...Barely any meat... Way too much bun... Withered lettuce...*thumbs down*"}
{"text":"Food was Ok... Service not very good , No napkin, fork, or offered Ketchup for fries.."}
{"text":"Good Chicken club, fries were hot... just couldnt understand person on intercom clearly..over all it was OK"}
{"text":"Lots of fruit flies in the washrooms and loud rattling hand dryers. Needs a bit of a facelift?"}
{"text":"this place is ridiculously horrible with customer service and discussing food. i called to tell them the food was horrible and the manager asunder me when i go to get my order replaced they said they would not replace the hole oder, just what they feel was or could have been bad. the original order was 35.00 bucks and they replaced  10 buck's. they didn't take in consideration that everything was cold, that the frys were hard, the drinks were watered down, fish was old, chicken was hamburg and the whopper was nasty. i will recommend never to go to this location for food it will give you diarrhea. they won't give money back and redo the hole order. don't go there to eat."}
{"text":"I stopped in this Burger King last week (haven't been to one in a few years) and ordered food in the drive thru. The person who took my order was very patient and really nice. The burger was great. When I have a taste for a burger again I will definitely stop into this location."}
{"text":"This location on 3620 Tropicana avenue is total garbage, the food is dry or old tasting and the cooks talk alot of nasty and faul language, while cooking you're food I went there, with a friend to eat and was attended by a young African American,man that was rude and too busy starring, talking and giving of body language to, the latina cashier next to him, as we ordered the young black man, was rude in a hurry and after wards ran to the latina employee and gave her a fast kiss, its nasty if you think of the people doing sexual things and cooking you're good with dirty hands, or god knows what else is going on in there but this place, is horrible the cashiers having hanky panky at work in front of you, and the cooks dirty mouths going of, while the children present are listening and seeing this nasty faul misconduct, I'm surprised the owners are not on top of this, and if the owners read tjus, I hope you roll back you're cameras to witness the nasty distasteful, boligerant, example of you're restaurant these people area making of it..."}
{"text":"AWFUL SERVICE.  They gave my food to the worng person couldnt even tell me, they just kept me waiting.  Very rude, unprofessional.  horrible.  I wouldnt even give them one star, but in order to post this i have to."}
{"text":"Worst Burger King Restaurant I have ever been in Canada! I ordered a caesar salad and there is a dead insect on lettuce! I showed the salad to their manager and he removed the ant quickly with his finger and quibbled that the dirt is part of bacon. He even didn't say sorry about this. The management is really bad, The washroom floor is dirty and the hand dryer does not work at all. One toilet in women washroom is out of service for a long time, only one is working in the entire store! Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"I take myself and I keep on saying out loud to myself \"I'm wanting a shake\" my friend wants one too so after the cashier here's us and when we ask to order he says the shake machines busted. I also had to go up to the counter 3 more times because of horrible service."}
{"text":"Standard Burger King, Shady Location  For some reason all the bums like to hang out in this location.   Pros: Good place when craving a standard whopper Normal Burger King Menu  Cons: Feels slightly dangerous after hours (for canada) Food staff looks like on meth"}
{"text":"By far, I prefer this fast food restaurant over all others! I've been coming here for about three years and have only had a few issues with service. The staff is friendly, the food is usually good, and the restaurant is fairly quiet throughout the day. Aside for the few times where food has taken longer than expected to be made (or a wrong order given to us), my family has had good times at this place.   My sole complaint (aside from the general issues with food service that arise every now and again)  is that the counter help sometimes bring your trays of food to your table. This is a nice plus in the fast food industry, but it irritates me when I have to walk to get my food and then proceed to watch as the people next to us have their food brought to them despite there being no issues regarding age or disability. It is completely disrespectful and rude when this occurs. It implies that there is a level of class that you do not have and that others do. I would recommend that all food is brought to the customers or that no food is brought out. I understand that I dress extremely casual for a person with a law degree, but providing that added service to a person based upon appearance is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The food is Burger King food. I don't have high expectations regarding quality. I do however expect that customer service will be at least up to par with other fat food joints.   This morning, i pulled in to grab a quick sandwich before a long day of meetings. After the car in front of me got done ordering, i pulled up to the menu, and was greeted in the normal fashion. Provided my order and got a \"thank you\". No total. No instructions to pull forward. So I pulled forward. Then the wait started....3 minutes......5 minutes....*shuts off engine*.....7 minutes before the person in front of me was presented with their order.....then more waiting, as the car and the girl in the window carry on a conversation lasting approximately 2 minutes.  When I finally got to the window. The employee asks \"What did you want on that again?\". I was a little taken back and said \"So, my order has not been put in yet?\". She snapped at me in a very matter-of-fact tone \"NO\".  Had she seemed even remotely understanding i would have just placed my order at the window. Instead I placed my money back into my pocket and began to pull away. At which point I received a very sarcastic \"Byeeeeee\".  For the Owners/Manager/Operators: There is very little that distinguishes your food from the other fast-food joints. I don't go because it's better. I go because it's convenient to where I am at any given time. I will, however, give my business to locations that provide stellar customer service. If you aren't communicating the need for customer service to your employees, you are failing. If your employees are not providing at LEAST a minimum of proper customer service, then they are failing you, and your bottom line.   I won't be going back to this location any longer for food, drinks, or the occasional shake anymore."}
{"text":"Summary: excellently prepared food, friendly and fast service, uncharacteristically Burger King  If you are in the market for excellently prepared food, friendly and fast service, and an uncharacteristically Burger King staff go and stuff your family for a bit Burger King price. BTW. It is BK so Excellent nutrition is not to be found. Also, these folks are a bit dedicated on their breakfast hours. I have been waiting in line while the person before me got breakfast and I was refused due to the past 10am curfew on egg sandwiches."}
{"text":"I needed to drink so we pulled into this Burger King. Was pleasantly surprised. Ordered a couple double cheeseburgers and chicken and everything was fresh hot and delicious. Good job Burger King"}
{"text":"One of the few locations that still has Satisfries. They have my business before other BKs."}
{"text":"3 people I know, including myself, have had food poisoning from this establishment.  Figure this shit out BK... It could be from that so-called \"cow\" meat that you use, poor work ethic/carelessness from the employees, or as a fast food conglomerate, health of the consumers is last on the priority list.  People, do not eat this trash, it is disgusting and is a slow killer..."}
{"text":"BK stands for Bi-polar Kondition.  I've been here when it was staffed by old ladies who were slow but made EVERYTHING fresh when you ordered it (not fast but oh so tasty!), and later there were unusually attractive teen girls who were SO slow to dish out cold, stale food.  If you're waiting to place your order at the sign for more than 8 minutes - just pull out and drive away. The last three visits were so bad I'll probably never go back."}
{"text":"Very bad branch, we arrived 15 minutes before closing time and the branch manager just closed the door in our face, very rude staff especially girl name Yem. Don't go there!"}
{"text":"Food from this BK is NEVER. Hot , especially any form of potatoes. Maybe during peak hours you might get lucky with hot food. The service is pretty quick but that's probably because the food has been under the heat lamp for 10 min or so. Your way right away ? How about HOT & FRESH every so often"}
{"text":"I order the chicken fries before and after it came back on the menu it was awesome and I think Burger King is different history of timeline from the 70s and my opinion or a fact about Burger King is I like it"}
{"text":"If you have time to kill, you will be just fine...employees at this joint are not, I repeat ARE NOT, going to break thier neck to help you, take your order, etc.  They are getting paid by the hour and making it real obvious...but anyway brand new remodel so it looks snazzy, and food wise got exactly what I ordered and how I wanted it...when I finally got it..."}
{"text":"The Manager Ray here is awesome. We come for the play place and the service is the best I've seen at any Burger King."}
{"text":"Do not go to the new Burger King on the corner of W Cactus Rd. close to closing time, they will give you the old dried up food that's left. I went over 20 minutes before they were to close to get a fish sandwich and was sorely disappointed when I got home to a completely flat and hard fish. Good business will always give you it's best no matter what time it is. And I don't know how BK still have the gull to call it's fish sandwich Big Fish when it's now smaller than the McDonald's fish sandwich. BK stop it!! You no longer have the BK Big Fish.. it's a tiny fish!"}
{"text":"Free fries?  Came here for free fry promotion.  Wasn't crazy about the new fries.  Service was adequate and fast through drive through."}
{"text":"Every time I go  to this location they mess up  everyones food.  Tonight they didn't even put my sons food in  the bag!  They Stink, I would not recommend this location :("}
{"text":"The walls are the color of cat puke, the floors feel like they've never been mopped, the whole place smells like feet, and to top it off there were people panhandling in the doorway with the employees doing nothing about it. I advise you to not eat at this Burger King as it is one of the most filthy and disgusting fast food places I have ever been to. This is the only BK near my house and the other one is 5 miles in the opposite direction, and I have been there once and will not come back. I am writing this for the warning of other people so they do not go here. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with the family. However, today's trip left me with a bad taste in my mouth (literally). First, the burgers that we got were fresh except for the buns. The buns were stale and it was completely noticeable (hard as rocks). I would have returned to get replacement burgers, but I figured something might happen to my food given the attitude I experienced (explained next).   Second, the lady who took my order attempted to give me a combo meal instead of the individual items I ordered. So when I attempted to present the coupon I got in the mail, the guy who took over the drive-thru window had to call her back and have her swipe her card in order to process the coupon. Therefore, while guy was fixing the order on the register, the lady (turned out to be the manager) opened the window, said nothing, and shoved a drink in one hand and a bag of food in the other at me. I politely said, \"Thank you,\" but I got nothing in response. I don't understand the rudeness. Her employee who took over the window (red-haired guy) was extremely polite and told me to have a great day, which kind of made up for her rude attitude.  All-in-all: The manager was the most rude person that I dealt with here.  However, as with any fast food place, the food is not always going to be what you expect, but you can likely skip the attitude I found here and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"So I usually only go thru the drive thru when it's super late, and to be truthfully honest I do like McDonalds more but sometimes you get that urge for a Whooper! The drive thru is usually really quick and I have never had a problem with an order.  All around I get a solid performance from this Burger King! Stop by if you get a chance, oh and if your not in the mood for a Whooper try their double cheese burger with king sauce, it's Great!!"}
{"text":"Looked for someplace to pickup food. Stated hours on Tuesday are open till midnight. Stopped by there at 11:20pm and all the lights are off and some workers sitting outside the restaurant told me it was shutdown for the night. No apology or explanation. Glad I made the drive there. Fortunately McDonald's right across the street was open."}
{"text":"I came to this location by accident due to one of my business partners giving me the wrong location but let me just say that I am thankful they did that because this morning the whole staff greeted me with big cool-aid smiles!!! They were very nice to me and my son!! I have been in customer service for 14 years and I know when someone is happy in what they do!!! I live by Hollywood and lakemead and the way I was treated this morning by this wonderful staff, I told them that I appreciate them being positive and receiving me the way they did that I would not mind driving back there just to eat at their restaurant!!! I value great customer service!!!! Keep it up guys!!! On their way to be the #1 store in the valley!!!"}
{"text":"The worst Burger King I have been to and now that we moved,  it's unfortunately  the closest one.  Every time we go they always get our order wrong and the fries are cold and are not fresh.  Not sure why we continue to go back.  I guess hoping that things will turn around?"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went in here and received some of the worst service I've ever seen. We came in roughly 25 minutes until the dining room closed and the bitch of a manager with the blonde braided hair and no name tag (gee, how convenient) told us that we only had 5 minutes left and so the order needed to be to go. After she blatantly lied to our faces and with about 15 minutes left, she tells us we have 10 minutes (too stupid to keep her lies straight) and proceeds to lock the doors. With 3 minutes to go, she then tells us how sorry she is, but they're closed now. As we're leaving, I tell her that we can find better service elsewhere, to which she responded with a rude comment. Also, my girlfriend almost slipped and fell because they already started mopping the floor, but didn't have any wet floor signs by the door."}
{"text":"You can't even get a simple order right. It was written on the paper. How hard can it actually be. And you guys want 15 an hour."}
{"text":"Just re-opened under brand new management. A complete 180. Went once when it was the black market BK and it was dirty and meh food. Went last night, spotless interior, food was fresh/hot/yummy. Definitely one of the best BKs I've been to in recent memory. Hopefully the turnaround sticks."}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly. I prefer dining in over drive thru so i cant comment on drive thru orders. Food wise i mean it's a fast food franchise so it's consistent in taste with all of them. Thing that stands out to me is how fresh they seem and when i do get my food the bread isnt all beat up and flattened up and the veggies are actually pretty fresh"}
{"text":"First of all, I would give NO stars. Service was horrible. The manager Gavvy allowed 3 people to go ahead of me and wouldn't honor the coupon I had. She was rude and inconsiderate. The same exact coupon she had me down load the app and present the coupon. Even after another cashier came to help and she dismissed him and had him help another guest before me. Then they had an issue with giving 1 extra ranch dip and said they'd have to charge 27 cents. I said forget it. Then a couple that had ordered something said they messed up their order. I expressed their poor service and Gavvy, the manager said she was going to come to my work and start trouble and I had witnesses hear her so I took my phone out and recorded her. I took down the witnesses number since she apparently called the cops because I was recording her and she said I couldn't. I explained AZ law allows no permission to record."}
{"text":"Devoured... must i say anymore? Ok, I normally only go to two bk spots. This one & the one by my work in Tempe, off of Priest & Elliott. This one, on Camelback and 99th is 10*sThe one in tempe 0*"}
{"text":"The drive-thru is horrible. Third and last time I have been here and used the drive-thru. They always tell you to pull around front when there are no cars behind me. If I wanted to park in the parking lot, I would just go inside. Nice people just awful drive-thru service."}
{"text":"Worst fast food experience ever! One employee leaning against counter playing on his phone with no regard to customers. We ordered from another employee and got our cups.  We went to the soda machine and no ice. Some girl in the dining room with her baby says we are out of ice. None  in the store. She must be an employee.  Than she says I thought there was a sign on the door but I guess not. Wouldn't have paid for drinks had we known there was no ice. Who wants warm soda? As a restaurant GM I have had ice issues and immediately run to the store for bags of ice, but I guess your employees would rather lean and play on their phones. My husband went to stand at the counter and wait for the food and the guy on his phone goes in a rude tone what are you waiting for bro? Never should an employee call a customer bro! Upon getting our food the burger had tomatoes on it and it was ordered without tomatoes.  The chicken on the sandwich wasn't even warm to the touch. The booths were filthy and there were flies flying all around us. Had I walked into my store a mess with employees on their phones I would have let everyone go on the spot! And no ice! I would of lost it! My daughter is a cheerleader at the school across the street and one to two times a week the squads walk over there to eat in between practice and games. There is anywhere from 20-45 girls.  That is good business. I am going to let them know they shouldn't be eating in such a disgusting environment and suggest they go to jack in the box across the street.  Furthermore employees should look presentable.  Not in sagging, dirty  pants. Shirts not tucked in and walking back and forth inside to outside. Absolutely horrific experience! Don't go there!"}
{"text":"I come here only because it's close to where I work and I go there during my lunch break. I have had multiple incidents but haven't complained until a couple of weeks ago. I have asked for onion rings and received fries. I have asked for Coke and received diet, and even after asking the woman at the window if it was regular because the screen said diet she replied with \"Yeah, it's regular\" and it wasn't! I order clearly and slowly because I know how some fast food workers are and it STILL doesn't help. I went today using a coupon I received for complaining and they were so confused and once again, the women selected fries when I clearly said onion rings! The woman was so confused with my coupon that she didn't even hear me try to confirm that I ordered onion rings because the screen said fries. I told the woman that I asked for onion rings and she replied with \"You want fries instead?\" and I said \"I ASKED for onion rings...\" It's not like I changed my mind at the last second! It was overall a bad experience and the woman was pissed off when I left. How can you mess up EVERY SINGLE TIME?! This is why I stick to \"No $15/hour for fast food workers\". I'm sorry, but too many mistakes in a short amount of time!"}
{"text":"After several recent visits during breakfast, I'm frustrated for getting consistently charged more than the drive up menu indicates.  While the employees seem to try most days, the food is inconsistent."}
{"text":"Only come here if you have time to kill. I've been here three times...and twice I finally walked out (along with a few other people who gave up as well). They're extremely slow and don't really care how long it takes them to get around to your order. It isn't an issue with the number of employees, either, because there's usually five to six employees hanging around waiting for someone else to do their job. While I was watching the (very slow) guy in the back putting the burgers together, the woman up front was staring into space. Apparently, there's some Burger King law that says you have to wait until you have the hamburger on the tray before you can scoop out the fries and onion rings. Absolutely ridiculous. I get faster service at a sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"came here for years. confirmed closed now. signs have been posted saying as much."}
{"text":"Pretty sad when you go in and your looking at a picture of what the burger should look like and when you get it, it is a big joke! So we went in and tried the new steakhouse king burger. Such a disappointment. The picture shows it over flowing with bacon and dried onions on it and sauce. HA! whatta joke. Opened up it and you get 2 little 1 inch bacon pieces and 3 chunks of dried onion and sauce there was none on it. The only thing it had going for it was 2 big meat patties and cheese."}
{"text":"Very salty! I ordered the chicken sandwich, and I can tastes the NaCl and whatever chemistry in every bite. Not coming to BK anymore! In a world with do many health problem related to height salt in taken, why you are still keeping them high! This is the kids. Favorite place for soft ice cream, I will not bring them for meal again."}
{"text":"I've tried stopping here numerous times on mondays around 9:10 to pick up food for the kids after band practice and they're almost always closed. Change your sign or hire some people that aren't going to regularly close up early."}
{"text":"Went here for my boyfriend and went through the drive thru to save time, unfortunately it didn't save much time considering we were waiting for a good 10+ minutes in line, finally when we got his food it was wrong...."}
{"text":"I've actually been here four times, and I've yet to have a bad experience! Thanks for the good service and the freshest fries! Keep it up guys :)"}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Burger King I usually order the 2 for $5 deal and chicken fries  The service is good and the food is decently put together however the bathroom cleanliness isn't exactly 5 star material  Overall this is a nice place to go to if you would like to have a quick meal before going back on the road"}
{"text":"I stood at the counter in front of the register for 10 minutes. No one was at the register, then a employee came to the counter called out a number looked at me then walked away & continued her conversation with the other employees. I was never acknowledged. This location has no customer service and I will never come back. I simply went to Taco Bell & they immediately greeted me & even gave me a larger soda because I had to wait"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get their NEW Chicken Sandwich.  Never again! see photo of what I got."}
{"text":"The prices here was cheap for stores inside a mall. Cashier was friendly and wait time was fast. Food was kind of over cook.  Very convenient and nice overall."}
{"text":"I ordered the double whopper sandwich combo and got a double cheeseburger instead. I had also ordered the a.1. ultimate cheeseburger combo, received a single piece of bacon and one patty. I do not recommend going during the late shift."}
{"text":"I walked in too order and seen the food prepper wasn't wearing any food prepping gloves"}
{"text":"I arrived and decided to go thru drive thru I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries....my sandwich was cold and my fries were hard like they weren't cooked....very disappointed"}
{"text":"Going to BK is always out of hunger and not preference, and this experience will explain why. I'm not a very picky eater and like things plain. Ordered chicken fries and typically tasted like they had been sitting for hours.  No big deal was as expected. The next one shocked me. The BK pulled pork I ordered plain, no toppings no extra sauce. The hockey puck of pork was dry and felt as if it had been compressed with a patty maker. This has put me off of BK for now ."}
{"text":"Not impressed... I expect drive-thru to mess up not walk-in... Ask for Big chicken they give me big king... Ask for whopper with cheese no onion they give me a whopper with no cheese extra onion... Onion rings cold. Really are you kidding me!"}
{"text":"The last three times I have gone here they had me pull forward and wait when there were no other cars behind me. And wait a good ten minutes today!!! Are your drive thru times really worth giving bad customer service? Because I will take my business somewhere else when I see 5 other people walking out with food when I was there first."}
{"text":"Haven't had burger King for years and they have hands down the best eggs for a fast food."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 2 times since their reconstruction and both were disappointing. First time was drive through to get 2 sausage egg and cheese croissant meals. After waiting for 6 minutes I Got to work and they were both bacon egg croissants (really)?  Second visit was with my boss to try out the hot dogs. First of all, you can't even get into the lot because of the way the drive through is designed. Once you do get inside there are 2 registers to handle a large crowd that is kept waiting for their orders on an area sooooo small they are tripping over each other.   Then the dogs come, they look pathetic and are cold but by this time lunch is almost over and you can not get through the mob to speak to anyone even if you wanted.   What a colossal waste of money"}
{"text":"Its Burger king... Food is marginally better than McDonalds, but that doesn't mean the fries or burgers are cold by the time you sit.  Only thing this one has going for themselves is self beverage refills... Sure beats \"bothering\" an employee who wants 15$/hr to refill your cup.  If you like subpar 1 star fast food, you'll love it here!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Burger King between 5-10 times...and each time my experience gets worse.  Like the other reviews, I don't even bother going inside because of the type of people there are in there and it's always dirty.  Today I sat in the drive thru for about 25 minutes...which is normal for this Burger King.  My wife and I will never go to this Burger King again.  They need to close it down or spend the money to turn it around."}
{"text":"Worst Burger King ever! Rude! Never have what I want...always out of something it's dirty on the inside too Don't go to this one"}
{"text":"Food quality is kind of low, had several experiences where the soda tasted watery or there was no soda I wanted such as Dr. Pepper or Vanilla Coke. I also had a lot of delaying problems here. One time I order the drive thru, they told me to wait and I waited for 5 whole minutes before ordering. Another time I ordered inside on a very unbusy day around 6 pm and they took the cash register out for no reason. Ended up waiting 10 minutes! Right when I was about to leave and go to Wendy's, an employee finally reached out and took my order using the drive thru cash register. Seriously?! Try to avoid going here during lunch time, it's very packed and it takes approximately 10 minutes or more. I guarantee you will be late for work or school by the time because I was."}
{"text":"So far this is the worst drive thru experience i had encountered. So guys BEWARE! they have a horrible rude crew name LEONARDO. a f******g rude mexican guy. He doesnt listen thats why we got our order wrong. He wont apologize. he seems to hate his job. this kind of employee should not be working here!! disgrace to the company's name. And when we return to tell him they got our order wrong, he didnt apologize, just grabbed the burger in my hand together with the receipt and talked shit in spanish and called us \"pinche puta\". he thought we didnt understand what he said and when my partner confronted him and tell him how rude he is and that we'll gonna report him to the manager and corporate office, again he's rude attitude bursted out and what he did instead of apologizing, he showed he's badge and telling us his name is leonardo and said \"here's my name! what are you gonna do about it!\" and the supervisor named Fatima just stood there and did nothing too. (another mexican) wow! worst worst worst!  We did reported him to the store manager (which is, thank god! a white old lady) and listened to us and apologized to us. and we also reported him to the corporate office and filed a complaint. hopefully they'll do something about it."}
{"text":"Horrible. Not only did it take a half hour (30 minutes?! Really?) to get my food via drive thru, they messed up the order and the male manager (Assistant?) wasn't very apologetic. Not going back."}
{"text":"The food is never great and today they got 90% of my order wrong. Tried to call and complain, not picking up phones for an hour. No voice mail set up to record the complaint. Now they can add another 1 star review to their slate. Yes they have not improved since 2009 it seems."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Would not ever eat here again. The place was filthy. Ordered fries and chicken fries. Both were cold and withered. The employee seemed annoyed I was ordering food and actually rolled her eyes at me when I asked for an extra packet of mayo. Health dept. should pay a visit. Took 2 bites and dumped it all in the trash."}
{"text":"I stopped a the St Rose Burger King on my way to a concert to see Smash Mouth in Laguna Beach Ca. As arriving into the city of Luguna Beach I started getting the chills. I thought it was the weather difference from Las Vegas 110 degrees and it was 70 at Laguna Beach.  Long story short I got VERY SEVERE FOOD POISONING.  I was very sick for 3 days, missed the concert and had to pay for a an extra night for hotel.  I have never had a problem with Burger King until I went to this location.  I will never eat at this location again.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"}
{"text":"The young girl working is rude. She had  an attitude all the time every time I visit she even said my card was declined and never gave it a second shot when I knew I have money on it.  When it went through,  her facial expression was very unpleasant.  It was the last time I'm visiting."}
{"text":"I agree with the other review. SKIP this one and go to the one just up the road on Val Vista & Warner. I have visited this one twice. I should have learned my lesson when I got cold food the first time I went here. I tried it again figuring maybe they just had a bad day as we all have them .. NOPE! The food was just as crummy as it was the first time.. but this time it was burnt. If I hadn't ordered it via drive thru, I would have sent it back. My whole order was not acceptable & was thrown right into the rubbish, except the soda. $7 wasted. BOO. Don't waste your seven bucks here!!!"}
{"text":"I can't complain about the food because that was just a burger and fries for me. It's just that the service here always sucked and it sucked once more. The drive thru is always slow and the service is not good either. If you go and hit the drive thru just expect a very long wait as that is their norm. If you do happen to go and it happens fast.. Thank your lucky stars and move on"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting.  The back area looks filthy, I went to pick up a double whopper by the drive thru and when I got home to add my BBQ sauce, there was a hole in my patty!  I drive back to the bk, looked at the cook and boy was she creepy.  Looking thru the burger slide with a guilty / am I in trouble face.  Damn lady!  You knew what you were doing!  Why did you serve that crap anyways?   I would never come here again."}
{"text":"Ein Burger King von seiner Art her wie jeder andere, allerdings recht schmuddelig. Bereits beim Betreten des leeren Restaurants (leer trotz dessen Lage) fanden wir den Laden nicht wirklich einladend. Alles wirkte schmutzig und ungepflegt und der Boden vor dem Counter klebte, was sich auch in den sanitären Bereichen wiederholte. Wir bestellten somit nur etwas zu trinken und verließen den Laden wieder, denn zum Essen war uns hier irgendwie nicht."}

{"text":"This Bk has the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. They always wait a very long time to answer drive thru, have an attitude on the head set, and don't punch in your order when you're actually at the order screen. They never ask me if that will complete my order, they assume I'm done and tell me they will have my total at the window. They have actually messed my order up several times for this very reason. They just made me wait for chicken nuggets, but gave me extremely old, nasty fries. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if I could. Drive thru only took 20 mins :-) dumb workers there can't do one job they have."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite to eat in the afternoon. The food, simply put, was not good, with typical Burger King problems: flavorless fries, bland nuggets, etc. the onion rings were the only good thing. As for the dining area, I didn't mind that it looked like it hadn't been updated since 1992. There were no ketchup dispensers so I had to get a couple packets at a time from behind the register every 3 minutes. Half of the buttons on the pop machine didn't work, some labels were lazily taped on, and it was literally falling apart: pieces were just hanging off, and when they went to clean it, a piece fell off. The staff was nice enough, buy the manager Tracy was not nice to the rest of the staff. She even got a bee up her butt because there was water on the pop counter near the grate (gasp!). So who did she blame for it? The new girl, who was working behind the register! I hadn't been to Burger King in a long time just because of the cruddy food, but now I have even more reasons not to go."}
{"text":"The pickle was the warmest part of the cheeseburger. No wonder there are never cars outside!"}
{"text":"I think I can win the \"worst service\" competition...I was just threatened, chased outside, and assaulted through the open window of my car by the drive thru worker!  I have never had that experience before.  I will be sure to go elsewhere from now on.  Update: Was just contacted by the location owner and he was very nice and concerned about the incident.  I still will probably not be going back to this location anytime soon, but am impressed with the response from the owner."}
{"text":"Very slow! Long lines! No care about your time! And to much talking about non work issues! Shut up and give better customer service! I will not return here again! I see why they have a low rating! Wish I had checked before I stopped by! Won't happen again!"}
{"text":"This place is on my travel path almost every day.  A while ago i gave up on their tired worn out appearance and employees.  About a month ago i noticed that they did a refit and the place i was going to nearby was having a long line.  So i gave them another chance.  They did a little better than most fast food places.  I see a bunch of complaints here but maybe only people who are aggravated complain here.  So I rate it a buy.  I gave it 3 stars because it is just normal fast food.  that was what i expected and what i got."}
{"text":"Friendly customer service. Requested lunch items during breakfast hours, they were more then happy to accommodate me. Would recommend this location. P.S. I went through the drive thru."}
{"text":"I ordered some burgers/wraps without lettuce and drinks. They didn't have my receipt number on the counter table as usual and I just assumed they just didn't print it yet, so I waited patiently.  After I saw about 4 people who ordered after me get their food, and FIFTEEN MINUTES, I asked the worker if they had our food and she said \"Oh I guess we forgot\".  I then got my food, after I waited a little bit longer to get my drinks and such, and sat at a table.  I opened my burger and realized there was lettuce in it, I looked at my receipt and it didn't say \"no lettuce\", so I assumed the cashier forgot to put that request or didn't hear. I did't really mind so I just removed it.  I then opened my wrap and ONCE AGAIN there was lettuce. This time it was different. I checked my receipt and it said \"no lettuce\" under the wrap. Again, I removed the lettuce and ate the wrap.  The fact they forgot about my order, made me wait 15 minutes AND couldn't get my order right..."}
{"text":"Its been over 3 years since my hubby and I visited a BK.  (New commercial - veggie burgers, etc) We went to the drive thru and ordered burgers, which literally took 5 minutes.  After taking payment, we were advise to drive up to the front door and park.  We waited another 10 minutes for our \"fast food\" dinner.  Then, part of our order was missing, another few minutes.  We get home, the burgers are BURNT - NOT EDIBLE.  Any trained cook would know to START THE F*CK OVER on those burgers. They were not fit for our dogs to consume.  DISGUSTING!  I called the manager, who spoke very little English and was completely unhelpful.  I am SUPER PISSED we wasted our money and time on crap food.  I went to myBKexperience.com, but apparently they only want to hear some feedback, because they \"had received the required amount of feedback for the time period.\" WHAT? *ALSO, I should add the \"manager\" said she would provide us with a refund, but we had to drive the 20 minutes back to her store - RIGHT NOW with the credit card.  Yeah, Easter weekend, Ill just drop everything.  UGGG!."}
{"text":"To start, I  havent had fast food for a few months and tonight after having a few beer's and living in sun city near nothing open i ventured out to BK. Best desicon in a while. They ran out of something so gave me and my gf a upgraded menu item for free and then doubled the order when realizing there were two of us. We will most definitely  think twice about no fast food. We were used to poor service and food quality but the night manager roped us back in tonight!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. We had to repeat our order at least 4 times and they still got the order wrong they where very slow."}
{"text":"What a piss poor experience waited in drive  through line for 20 plus minutes just to receive the WRONG order  then proceed to go in and have it corrected which it was but every single time its always something wrong how incompetent does one have to be to make buffalo chicken strips ? I mean REALLY ?"}
{"text":"you ain\"t been to vega$ till you've eaten at the burger king in the back of o'sheas!"}
{"text":"Yuck!! Gross!!  We seldom eat fast food, but on rare occasions it is a needed stop. Always regret eating at BK.  In 4 years, we have NEVER gotten the correct order. NEVER. There is always something wrong. Suppose I should be grateful because it deters me from eating this faux food crap."}
{"text":"So we dropped in this Burger king for a quick dinner to take home. We tried to go through the drive thru.  We sat in the drive thru for 5 mins..maybe longer and it did not move! I gave up and backed out of the drive thru since i hadnt even placed my order yet, and decided to just go in.  Walked in and the place was fairly clean except they had ALOT of flies in the place. Alot of workers were standing there at the heater that was full of burgers. Dont know what they were doing but they had a whole drive thru full of cars they could have been taking care of. The order taker was friendly.  I ordered a whopper with cheese with mayo, ketchup, pickles. 10 piece chicken nuggets. Chicken fries, onion rings and a bacon cheeseburger.   The whopper had lettuce on it didn't ask for that. No ketchup and the chicken nuggets were not fully cooked. Cold inside. The chicken fries were overcooked and there was some spice on the onion rings that made them spicy enough that my child didnt want them. Maybe pepper but who puts pepper on onion rings?   I dont expect much from Burger king its fast food after all, but at least get the order right."}
{"text":"Das Essen ist nicht in der Burger King Norm. Die Restaurantleitung hat keine Ahnung von Mitarbeiterführung. Mitarbeiter werden werden aus nichtigen Gründen abgemahnt. Trinkgelder sind nicht für die Mitarbeiter sondern für die Kinder vom  sogenannten Chef."}
{"text":"Must have been a bad hair day for folks at this eat out. We ordered their 2 for $5 chicken sandwich special and also the chicken fries. Could barely go thru 25 % of the sandwich and then we just dumped it in the garbage.  It was terrible to say the least.  Generous loads of salt, over fried chicken and stale lettuce.  Could not believe that so many things can go wrong in a preparation of a sandwich.  And the chicken fry ? It was deep fried to such an extent that a little more would have rendered it un-edible.The only saving grace was the French fries which was fortunately done right. I have been here before and was extremely disappointed with the food experience."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Burger King in a long time, but I really like this one. The loss of one star is because they changed the fries and I prefer the ones from my youth.  However I LOVE the music they play!!! All 50's and 60's. I haven't heard Tommy Roe sing about Sweet Pea, or even thought about Betty Lou' new pair of shoes in ages. It was such a treat. And I'm not a relic, I'm an 80's rock child, but this is the stuff my parents listened to, so I grew up listening to it too!  Plus the have $.75 cones."}
{"text":"I just had the a terrible visit to store #8883 in Charlotte NC. First off when you're trying to order and get a \" is that it?\" After every single item and I don't talk slow. She sounded so angry. While waiting I heard her taking another guests order and she was even more rude to them. She kept saying \"just pull up, I said just pull up.\" Kept cutting him off. She was talking to co workers and said \"You wait till he get up here.\" Guess what, he pulled out of line, wander why? She was waving and saying bye really loud. So inappropriate! Get my bag handed to me and I'm checking to make sure everything was in the bag. I mean 4 sandwiches and 3 large fries in one bag? She was irritated I didn't pull right off. She said it's all in there  and someone else said i put 3 fries in the bag. When you throw the fries upside down in the bag, under the sandwiches, it's hard to see. They were old. Cold and nasty anyway. I will never, ever be back!"}
{"text":"Skip it. Food was Lukewarm. Food was Not fresh. The Order was wrong. I rarely go to Burger King and this experience will likely make it even less often"}
{"text":"Schlechte, unengagierte und unfreundliche Bedienung.    Wenn man seinen aufgemotzten Opel Corsa vorführen will oder gerne quietschende Reifen und aufheulende Motoren hören will, ist man beim BK in Stade richtig. Ärmlich."}
{"text":"I almost feel like I HAVE to review this BK because the only time I eat BK is when I'm at the airport, particularly at this one at McCarran! HA! Don't forget that breakfast only goes til 10am ;)  They're pretty good w/ the quickness but it's called fast food for a reason :p  The best part is you'll meet all sorts of interesting people while you're eating here.  Oh Vegas!"}
{"text":"Tja, wenn man nur inkompetente Aushilfen statt festen Mitarbeitern beschäftigt, kommt eben nichts bei raus. Kalter Burger und 15 Minuten für Nuggets. Mahlzeit!!!!"}
{"text":"I know I shouldn't expect much from BK, but this location is ridiculous.  You really shouldn't even THINK of going here during lunch.  They have ONE cash register at the front of the store.  Not just one OPEN register...  they only have one register, usually being operated by the slowest person they employ.  The drive-through is no better.  Cars are backed up into the next parking lot.  If you insist on trying to eat there, I would suggest you go inside to eat, that way, when they invariably get your order wrong, you can throw it directly at them.  If you get drive-through you will end up like me, paying for a double cheeseburger only to get back to your desk and find out that they totally screwed you and only gave you a single.  You will then slam your fists on your desk and start swearing and get called into your boss' office...  at least that's what happened with me. YMMV"}
{"text":"WORST LOCATION EVER !!! I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN EVERN IF ITS 1 MIN AWAY FROM MY HOUSE. WE WENT TO EAT LATE ABOUT 9:45 not knowing they closed the lobby at 10pm the manager took our order with no friendly customer service what so over \"let that slide\" as we began to ate me and a group of friends (6) as soon as it turns 10 pm she turned off the lights and the soda machine while we were still in their eating !!!! And when i let her know that it was rude to turn them back on she said they turn off automatically i cant do nothing so i let it go as we were finishing off eating in the dark the cooks comes and says you guys need to get out already its enough so my friends says ok 2 more min we are finishing up then the rude cook says no get out now you guys can get out good or bad either way im taking you guys out !!! So he proceded to stare us down and said he was calling the cops so unnecessary all we asked was for 2 min !!! Point is we all want to close at a certain time but i would have appreciated them to let us know before we were buying food so we can take it to go or instead of shutting the lights letting us know and being nice about it ! Oh and one more thing Horrible management to shes rude to her employees two !!  As we were eating she was snapping her fingers at two pore employees that looked miserable !!! Shes so rude ! Point is burgerking you lost 6 customers for life ... And i will mention this to my neighbors that also live across the street from this location!!"}
{"text":"This Burger King ruined it for me for all burger kings forever.  I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich at the drive thru and took it home (only a couple of blocks away) and as I opened the bun to add a little salt the lettuce was brown and wilted. Disgusting and I threw the whole thing away. I can only imagine how they prepare all their food if they let this one go like that. Nasty. And I'll never go back!"}
{"text":"As a Burger King unit, this Kannapolis location is average to better than average.  The service here by the crew is not what is has been in the past. A couple of years ago, it was much quicker and faster, especially in the mornings. The manager on duty then was a guy who absolutely did care about his customers. Don't know what happened to him but he's been gone for a while and it's never been the same.  One feature which makes this Burger King unit stand out is their Coca Cola Freestyle machine. Almost an infinitely variable combinations of Coca Cola products available here."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, clean bathrooms and food is always prompt. Great staff, great attention and attitude to the customer."}
{"text":"Got my food fast and efficient.  Staff was very nice. Bathrooms and lobby are clean . What more can you ask for."}

{"text":"Food is always fresh and fast. Clean bathrooms.  Pleasant experience. Great staff, very nice and prompt."}
{"text":"I love Burger King, their food tastes better than mcdonalds, my favorite is the original chicken sandwich. I always ask them to cut it in half for me and they are always happy to do it. The workers were very nice as well."}
{"text":"Went in at 10 am on a Saturday.  Two people ahead of me that had placed their order and one at the car window.  Five people including the \"Manager\" behind the counter and it took them 4 minutes to take my order.  Sat down and one of the people waiting for her order started bitching that she had been waiting for over 15 minutes and what was the problem.  Another lady came in and the manager took her order and walked off.  After nine minutes I went back and asked if it was training day because they were really taking their time and the cashier said \"No...just another day.\"  The manager walked by and I asked if she was the manager and she said  \"Si\".  I asked her if she knew what she was doing because now I had waited 13 minutes and still no order.  The woman that the manager helped asked if her order was in because the manager had not taken her money and she said no and she left.  A few people came in and out and heard the problems and left.  After 17 minutes I finally got my order.  This Burger King will not be open in a year and if you hire management they better care about the job and be smart enough to handle the job."}
{"text":"I rarely read reviews of fast food locations, but if you are careful enough to pre-clear a BK lounge, good for you.  Avoid this one. Why be a \"Burger King\" at all if you are not going to participate in Burger King advertised nationwide deals or accept any Burger King coupons?  How about providing a sign stating your very unique non-participation in these deals on a door and at the drive-thru entrance?  I suppose that would be too honest and straightforward.  I guess that this horrible 35th Ave and Bell Burger King location is operating under the unlikely premise that they will reap huge profits by charging premium-plus prices as sort of a gotcha to people driving by with a coupon or two burning a hole in their pocket.  Actually, what they reaped from my visit is a would-be customer not spending a cent, obviously never returning, and (a couple weeks later, when bored) registering and writing my first Yelp review.  I know, weird way to get started with Yelp.  The Chick-Fil-A near the AMC Deer Valley is a short drive from this intersection, and has a much friendlier atmosphere (coupon friendly as well).   Heck, if you want burgers there is a Carl's Jr. across the street from this place.  I have not been to it since it was re-built after a fire some time ago, but I would bet that Carl's Jr. at 35th and Bell DOES accept Carl's Jr. coupons."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely disgusting.  The workers here are terrible, and the service is so slow. The food is outrageously expensive, and you get terrible service and quality."}
{"text":"I have been here 6 or 7 timetimes, every single time I get one of several unfriendly teenage girls with an attitude, no greeting and irritation that you have the nerve to go into their restaurant.  Once has there been a polite guy. Having worked fast food I am polite and use manners please and thank you and im not demanding but these girls have no respect or kindness. The food is good"}
{"text":"The food was okay and came out for a different time. But the smell was agonizing it disgusting. The first thing you smell when you get in there and it completely wipe away your appetite and smells like garbage. It's okay for the drive-thru but I wouldn't recommend going inside. There's also no outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I love their cranberry, apple & grilled chicken salad. The lettuce is fresh and the blue cheese does not taste cheap. The restaurant itself is clean and well furnished."}
{"text":"Great service, great, fresh, food. Clean all around. The Hispanic young man (I believe he is a manager, and if not he should be.) that served me did a great job. Very professional. The Big King is BK's 'Big Mac'. It is made exactly like the Big Mac. Even down to the special sauce. I tasted the meat more-so than anything.  The chicken nuggets were crispy fresh and good. Fries, as well.  I really love the Coke fountain they have here. You can add multiple flavors to your soda at no extra charge. Over all, I give this Burger King a 5/5."}
{"text":"Sorry, Burger King at 243 Yonge Street near the Eaton Centre, but you are just not trying hard enough.  Maybe your staff are too bored to take pride in their work.  I don't know.  Lineups are long and move slowly.  As usual in fast food places, there are lots of empty tables, none of which have been wiped.  I have been in here a few times and it is the same every time:  First, a filthy guy comes in from the street to my table and asks me for money \"for food\".  When I refuse, he becomes angry and goes to the next table.  They refuse and he curses at them and continues.  I didn't get a chance to tell him that that he can go to any one of several charities like the Salvation Army and get home made food three times a day every day of the week.  Better food than I can afford.  But he knows that already.  BK staff are wandering around but pretend they don't see him.  Next, a supposedly deaf person comes in from the street and throws a card down on my table (which I consider my personal space during the time I am eating).  He puts cards down on other tables, then goes back to each table and indicates that he wants money.  When I refuse, he slams his hand down on the table, grabs the card, and flounces out.  BK staff ignore this.  Since both of above have happened repeatedly, I think it is time to go elsewhere for my burgers.  How dumb can you be, Burger King, to let your paying customers be repeatedly verbally assaulted."}
{"text":"I went to Cliff castle casino the day before going to Burger King. I ordered two original chicken sandwiches and a iced tea at the drive through.   Was told by the cashier my $20 was fake.   I proceeded to give her another $20 and asked for the fake one back so I could take it to the casino where it was given to me. I was told no very rudely. I in turn was rude.   I left my name and phone # for the manager to call and discuss with me. That was 5 days ago and no call.   Did not appreciate being treated like a criminal or paying $28 for two original chicken sandwiches and a iced tea.   Don't go often but will never go back and will encourage others to do the same."}
{"text":"Just went through drive through I was asked to park.   10 minutes later I am still sitting here.   I go in and was told I ordered off the lunch menu and it was my fault.   I order breakfast produced my receipt.   The employee was so rude and I asked for my money back.   Employee became very sarcastic and told me to have a good day when I said I was speaking to corporate.  This store has gone down hill and the mgt does not care"}
{"text":"The consistently worse fast food restaurant I have ever eaten at! Every time I swear it will be the last time I give them my money. But then I have an exhausting day and being that i only eat veggie burgers, I end up there. Never again! They were pretty good when I first moved to the area about eight months ago. But then the whole crew changed and they immediately went from good, to completely sucky! They can't get the orders correct and the french fries are always cold. More than once they have told me to pull up and they would bring me my food; but they never do. I end up having to go in and there's my bag of food just sitting there. No one could be bothered to bring it out. I hadn't eaten there in monthes, but today I was too tired to cook. I stopped for the only thing I ever order; a veggie burger and a small fry. The fries were COLD, not warm, cold and very greasy. I park, bring them in and ask for hot fries. I ask very neutrally, with no tone. Frankly, I wasn't surprised something was wrong with the order so I wasn't even upset and I was too tired to be worked up about it anyway. The woman, yes a woman, not a teenager, or twentysomething, takes the fries, throws them in the trash and then screams at the top of her lungs. Yes, screams! There are only two other employees there and they didn't even look up. Obviously, she does this on a regular basis. Today will truly be the last time that BK ever gets a cent from me. I have no idea how they are still open."}
{"text":"I ordered a BK Big Fish. Haven't had one in quite awhile but stupidly had a taste for one. It tastes like it is five hours old,  hard and salty. I asked for extra tarter sauce, didn't get more than a dollop. Lettuce was also disgusting. After the second bit I pitched it. Whoever \"created\" this catastrophe of s sandwich should be ashamed of themselves putting out this low quality mess."}
{"text":"Service is fine which is why I gave them any stars at all. I ordered a chicken sandwich and it was pretty gross. It's very obvious when someone takes pride in making a sandwich and there was no pride in this. The chicken was obviously not freshly made, yet it was very hot which means they microwaved it, yuck. What little lettuce they gave me was wilted. This isn't the first time this has happened to me at this particular Burger King but I wanted to give them a chance and it was the same old crap. I wish I had gone across the street to Arby's or even better down the street to Subway. Freshness really is important."}
{"text":"Okay so I have to say I NEVER write reviews but as I sit here in the drive thru I felt the need to do this. After trying to be nice while ordering and cut off 4 times. Writing seemed like a good idea. When we got up to the window not even a smile and seemed like we were bothersome. Sorry I had to bother you and order from you while you were working. I hope you feel better and are able to make your customers enjoy their visit."}
{"text":"I have complained twice about not  wearing gloves! I made the manager re-make my order wearing gloves. they are getting better but I suggest you go in and look in the kitchen just to make sure the person is wearing gloves!"}
{"text":"I have come here multiple times and many times the food is NOT hot! I was there yesterday for breakfast (got French Toast Sticks) and it was NOT hot, it was luke warm. It also didn't have any powdered sugar on it like other Burger Kings have!"}
{"text":"I have come here multiple times in the morning when they are supposed to be open on my way to work and they were always late. Multiple times I had to go somewhere else and grab breakfast. I will say though that this place makes your food hot!"}
{"text":"Horrible service...face to face as well as drive-thru window. Shady...shady...shady business goes on behind the building between employees and guests."}
{"text":"This BK has horrible service!! They double charged me for breakfast and wouldn't refund me the extra charge, so I had to call my bank to file a claim to get my money back. Be aware if you go to this location!"}
{"text":"Ich kann burger king in stade leider auch nicht emphelen. Das letzte mal wahr einfach nur schlecht. Und wie ein vorredner schon schrieb. Wer opel corsa mir baumarkt tuning cool findet kann sich abends sicher mal sehen lassen.."}
{"text":"Been here several times and well, shame on me. It's never been pleasant from the 'who gives a #$%' staff to the incorrect orders to having to wait overly long times even with just a few customers in the place. Not even going into my experience today to prompt the review, but it was enough to say \"enough\"."}
{"text":"Not the Best Burger King in the world, you should probably just got to the Arby's or anywhere else actually, really poor quality and dirty"}
{"text":"I had the worst experience ever. i did not feel welcomed in the establishment and felt as if i was  burdening them with my order. i went to get food but i left with a burger and a shitty mood. Even a little kindness goes a long way."}
{"text":"Probably the only fast food restaurant I'm a fan of. Jr Whoppers are frickin' awesome. I haven't tried the new onion rings. I usually will get 3 Jr. Whoppers (without pickles) and drive home. This place is right next to the PA turnpike, so if you're going on a road trip. Load up on some Jr. Whoppers. MAN Jr. Whoppers are just BALLIN' ! Considering I live about 20 minutes away, I think that speaks for their quality of food. Burger King knows the score, and now you do too."}
{"text":"What is really sad is that I like Burger King but refuse to eat there because of the horrible customer service and food. I have yet gone to a Burger King that has impressed me. It's like they don't want to be there and it takes FOREVER to order anything. Who's interviewing these people?"}
{"text":"I recommend going to a different location Burger King is so good and I live so close to this location but from the 5 times I've been there service and food quality suck. If only the person in charge would do something about this because at this rate you guys will closed within 2 years. I run a food business and this is just pathetic. #TurnItAroundOrGetShutDown"}
{"text":"It's a Burger King.  My expectations were not that high.  However, they are unbearably slow, and the dining area is usually pretty dirty.  The food is mediocre, even for fast foot's low standards.  The staff usually acts like you're ruining their day for showing up."}
{"text":"When you compare it to the McDonald's across the street, the service is way better. Only thing these guys do wrong is they have Whoppers sitting around under a heater on Wednesday, far too many IMO. It's fine to have a few whoppers premade for the lunch rush but it feels like these guys just make a mountain in the morning and call it a day. Still tho. Whopper Wednesday."}
{"text":"Tried the new hotdogs today glad somebody is finally serving hotdogs I know it's not the best thing for you but every now and it does not hurt. I got two of them they were actually very very good I did not get the chili dog I got the regular dog with mustard relish and onion. Finally a fast food restaurant that serves hotdogs because there's nothing like a good dog every now and then.  I hope it catches on and it stays on the regular menu."}
{"text":"I have no idea what a Joo-Yer Chih'in Wit Cheess is. Everyone here talks like they crawled through the TV screen from a Tupac music video and we are in Medina Ohio. They were openly yelling about \"She lih'lerly juss leff n said ion curr if I get furred n now we hella short staffed\" so bring an Ebonics dictionary with you if you want to remotely understand what the staff is saying."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says, whoppers are hands down the best fast food burger. I don't really care for their fries though I always do the onion rings."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service... It's almost funny in all honesty. I had a gift card, and it was valid for $20 for anything at Burger King. The lady at the window has the nerve to barely glance at it and say 'That's for the Whopper only.' Like, no, I know what it is and it's a gift card. I'm not stupid. And to make things even worse/funnier, she has me pull up to the side of the street and almost brings me the wrong order for another car. Like really? Idk, maybe she was having a bad day or she's new, but it was funny and bad at the same time."}
{"text":"Why do restaurants think it's acceptable to just not open when their posted hours dictate? I showed up before they opened on a Sunday (my fault) but then at 7:05 I called and was told that they would not be opening at their 7 am time because they're running behind.  Sigh. And fast food workers want $15/hr?"}
{"text":"Update: 8/26/12  8:30 A.M. Hangover. Ordered 2 Whoppers w/o cheese and 1 Whopper w/ cheese and 1 order of onion rings. Drive-thru. Had to pull ahead and wait. 21 minutes later, a woman in a purple velvet one piece delivered our food. Don't they have work uniforms here? Jeeez."}
{"text":"My hubby was hungry after having a few drinks so we went out looking for something to eat. Everything was closed since it was past 11pm, except for fast food, so that was pretty much our only option. Hubby insisted on going to Burger King & got himself the chicken nuggets meal & for me the chicken fries meal. He was pretty tipsy so he downed his whole meal, but I was sober as can be & could only stomach about half. The fries were barely warm & way too crunchy. The chicken fries were so thick w/coating & just overall disgusting. The sweet & sour sauce I got w/them didn't help either, way too sugary sweet. Needless to say, if my hubby insists on coming here again out of drunkenness I am not ordering anything!"}
{"text":"Hace años que no iba a comer a Burger King, cambié por una cadena de fast food (la M amarilla) y la verdad es que ha cambiado el sabor.   Pedí una hamburguesa con doble queso y bacon. El tamaño me defraudó, no era mediana como decían sino más bien chica. En vez de papas fritas, mi combo lo pedí con aros de cebolla. Debo decir que no tienen gusto a cebolla ni a nada, muy desabridos.   La atención es regular, el aparato que tienen para hacer lo pedidos desde el auto se escucha horrible. Varias veces tuvimos que repetir nuestro pedido. Para cuando llegamos a la ventanilla para retirar el pedido, se habían confundido y pusieron todo papas fritas y no los aros de cebolla.  El chico que arma los pedidos fue buena onda y nos puso los aros de cebolla, dejando las papas."}
{"text":"I have had several bad experiences at this location but thought I would give it one more try.  Yesterday I went to the drive thru at 11:25 am.  They were not busy and ordered two chicken sandwiches and two small fries.  They asked me to pull up and wait for the chicken to be cooked, which I was MORE than happy do so.  I drive home (15 mins) and found only one order of fries, a cold, hard chicken sandwich, and a whopper.  ???  Last visit ever and will tell everyone I know to AVOID this location!"}
{"text":"We eat lunch often in the area and seem to always have a problem with having the food correct for what we ordered Dave"}
{"text":"Horrible service, both trash cans were over flowing with garbage on the floor everywhere. The stocking areas were a disaster and no one was bothering to clean anything even though there were no other costumers to attend to before and after our visit. Pure laziness! Both of us who ate there got sick and are still recovering 16 hours later! I will never eat at that location again and probably never at another Burger King restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends while ago to get some breakfast. The lady which I'm assumed was \"the manager\" ( because she dressed different from others) took our order. No hi/ hello but just \"what can I get you?\" Then she kept her straight face the whole time taking our order & rolled her eyes.  Food here was decent too. Their chicken was really juicy I would give it a 3 stars but bc of the customer service I had to give it a 1."}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago with a few friends bc we were craving for chicken fries. Saw the drive through light still on so we assumed it still open. Rolled up and was asking nicely to order. And the girl that was closing just turned the light off for the answer without even saying anything. Like you could've atleast said sorry we are closed but guess not. Thought that was really rude. Not gonna back come here again just cos of the poor customer service."}
{"text":"For a fast food restaurant quality, their stuffs is pretty decent.  I went through the drive through and the girl that was taking order kept rushing me didn't even give me time to decide what I really wanted. \"ANYTHING ELSE?!!ANYTHING ELSE?!!ANYTHING ELSE?\" Till the point my boyfriend would get so mad because she kept jumping on my mouth. And they had me parked my car outside for 10 mins. Didn't even give me the correct order so I walked it and there was 5 ppl prob more in the kitchen lol SO UR TELLING ME YALL DONT HAVE TIME TO KEEP UP THE COOKING WITH FIVE PPL IN THE KITCHEN DEFINITELY NOT COMING BACK"}
{"text":"Thanks Burger King for refusing me, a hungry, pregnant woman, after waiting forever in a line with one other car because you can't break a hundred, luckily jack in the box wasn't too far."}
{"text":"Okay place... just like any other burger kings in GTA"}
{"text":"I don't know why I like this place very much... but I'm pretty regular here.  Though a typical Burger place, this restaurant is clean and nice, with lot of parking space all around. Also, the people work here are much friendly."}
{"text":"This place should be avoided at all cost. Nearly every time I order through the drive through, they get my order wrong. I get off work in the am thinking I am going to get a double whopper with cheese. Nope . They took my money for it, but when I got home it was a single. Stay away from these rip off artist!!!"}
{"text":"Often say they are \"out of\" various foods, slow service, one day they were completely closed at 10 AM despite the website saying otherwise. Perhaps going out of business? This location should."}
{"text":"I was buying food at this place first time I used a bk coupon I hand the cuopon to cashier and he got mad he told me u supposed to let me know ahead about the cuopon he said you are making me waiste my time I told him sorry sir first time using coupons didn't know rude chunky Mexican guy what a way to treat customers thanks to them you have a job kid"}
{"text":"Dropped by on my lunch break because I had some coupons and got a whopper, fries and drink for a little more than $5. Burger was a little bland compared to what I'm used to at Mcdonald's but not bad for the price. Staff is friendly and place doesn't fill up too much at lunch"}
{"text":"My experiences in the dining room and drive thru vary. While the service at the drive thru is better than inside, the real difference is breakfast vs. lunch is food quality. For the third time the bacon on the Crosanwich was unheated, just put on the unheated egg Pattie. This is made worse by the fact that I ordered a sausage Crosanwich. The nice woman who took my order was arguing loudly with some man in the kitchen prior to giving me my order. What was the argument about? Why is it the third time my breakfast here was unheated? Unheated! What does that guy in the kitchen have against doing his job?"}
{"text":"I have tried over and over again to give this BK a fair shot to know when someone asks for cheese you put cheese on the sandwich. So today for the sixth time I asked for a cheese burger, had the lady say cheeseburger back to me, still no cheese on my sandwiches, then they neglect to answer their phone. If you are seeking disappointment please visit them."}
{"text":"I feel like this BK is the best in the valley as far as service, food quality, and quickness. The employees are always friendly inside or in the drive thru.  keep it up"}
{"text":"these people dont know how to work.... they should fire all the dumbass employees and hire people who need to work.... everytime i come here and get someting they always gotta fk somehing up.... every single damned time this place sucks dickkkkkk"}
{"text":"This is the worst fast food franchise in town.  The drive through is slow.  The food is inconsistent.  The staff are ambivalent.  Averaging over a minute per vehicle in the drive through isn't \"fast\".  Serving burgers with mere samples of the veggies in the marketing material demonstrates poor attention to detail, if not inventory management problems.    They can't even consistently pack bags so that the fries stay in their containers.  Why bother with the containers at all if the fries are just going to be scattered throughout the bag?  The franchises in Sun Prairie and De Forest remain \"east side\" options, but I'm giving up on this location.  Four chances in two years, and they never got it right."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE MANAGER MYRA. She needs to take some classes on how to properly manage her employees and how to train and be professional in a work environment. She does not give any training on the employees and just leaves them alone and does not even try to help them. Myra yells at the employees in front of customers who are trying to have a good meal but cant because this lady and her evilness lurking within her overcomes everything that's going on inside. How can someone be so cruel like that? if i could give this place a -0 stars i would."}
{"text":"I tried going a taco hell drive thru again ... another one under construction!   What is up with that?!?  So she went to BK... and pretended like I never order fast food, had to drive up to explain just how I wanted my chicken sand... apologized profusely for not knowing the menu.  LOL  They were very nice although they charged me for a soda even though all I asked for was ice.  I have got to stop this fast food track I'm on or I won't fit in my cute new car!  Sometimes it's just so damn convenient and when you are always in a hurry like me, this BK drive thru meets your needs quick!"}
{"text":"Ich dachte ja,nach dem ganzen Wirbel um die schlechten Zustände,hätte sich jetzt etwas geändert. Daher wollte ich einen neuen Versuch starten und mir einen Burger gönnen. Wir bestellten also 2 Big Kings und 1x Nuggets. Das Personal war in Ordnung,das Essen aber war fast kalt,der Salat auf den Burgern war nicht mehr frisch und geschmeckt hat es auch irgendwie anders,als in einer anderen Filiale. Die Nuggets waren sehr trocken."}
{"text":"I didn't place an order here because this location does not participate in the normal Burger King promotions such as the 2 sandwiches for $5 or the deals offered through the Burger King smartphone app.  There are several better Burger King's located a short distance from this one."}
{"text":"Store # 4477   2708 E University Dr Mesa, Az   On July 24, 2017 My wife and I went to this Burger King to specifically get the new (brought Back) chicken parmesan, and was told they did not have it because they ran out of the chicken!! So we had to make do?? Not very happy, very bad planning.   On August 12, 2017 Again we went to the same Burger King #4477 To get the Chicken Parmesan and the Mushroom Swiss King as before and was told they did not have the Mushrooms so it was not available! They did have the Chicken Parmesan but not the Mushroom Swiss.   So we made do??  Who ever is in charge of ordering needs to be fired!!  I can't go back there and get just what ever they want to serve. Very Very unhappy customers."}
{"text":"The food is okay but the service is horrible. I'm pretty sure the women taking my order rolled her eyes a few time ."}
{"text":"Found a hair in my burger. I called their corporate office. They did not take me seriously until I told them I took a picture of it. It's been 4 hours since I was told I would hear from someone....."}
{"text":"wow so good here, don't know if i can ever eat anywhere else! so tasty! very clean inside and good neighborhood!"}
{"text":"please do not eat there. my husband and me went to order our food and as we waited for our order one of the employees kill a rat next to the soda machine. he took of his shoe and smashedthe disgusting thing. i had to ask for my money back."}
{"text":"Burger King coffee is the best coffee ever. It makes me so happy when I drink it. They make it so sweet and same every time not like McDonald's their coffee always taste different every time sometime it'll be sweet but sometimes it's bitter. Anywho I would recommend this one they have good service also and I get many coupons that makes it so cheap!"}
{"text":"This place can be summed up in one word: DISGUSTING. I have been to Burger King before, so this review is NOT about the quality of the food. I have eaten at this restaurant before via drive-thru, but this was my first visit where I ate-in. I wish I hadn't. With the scorching summer temperatures and two very bored kids, I figured we'd hit a place with an indoor playground so they could burn off some energy.   Walking in the door, there was an odd smell. It should have been my first sign to turn around and leave. But with two small kids gunning for the playground, there was no way I could drag them back out without eating or playing without a screaming fit. So I pushed on, ordered food and paid. The service was friendly enough.   The buttons on the drink machine were sticky. Gross. Sign #2 that I should grab my kids and run. The indoor playground had only four tables in a wide open room, with two of them taken and one filthy, I opted for the only table available. The chair was sticky as we sat down. Already, before eating, my stomach churned at the thought of the impending food poisoning.   Everything was filthy at this location. I regret not grabbing my kids kicking and screaming and dragging them from the restaurant.  But it wasn't until I noticed the large rat house-style trap on the side of the building that I realized what I'd just subjected my family to.   Needless to say I will not be returning. The kids got a head-to-toe sanitizer bath in the car and a full bath as soon as we got home, in hopes of killing some of the germs that are no doubt crawling on every inch of their skin as a result of playing in the playground.   I would rather brave the 115 degree playground than return to this restaurant! YUCK!"}
{"text":"At one time I used to like burger king, and would've probably still have been a customer, but after eating here twice, was literally the worst food experience I have ever had, period. First off I ordered for my kids and I, A whopper with cheese, a chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets and a few orders of fries. The fries were completely inedible and very stale as if they were sitting out for 6+ hours or longer, the chicken nuggets were disgusting and were also extremely stale, my kids wouldn't even eat the fries or chicken nuggets, (and my kids will eat ANYTHING!!). I took one bite of my whopper and threw it away, Must be some extremely poor management going on this store, because I had the same experience here, twice in a row, makes me feel really stupid that I wasted my money like that. I will never eat burger king again."}
{"text":"I went to BK last Wednesday evening, and there was this tan gentleman doing drive thru orders. his level of customer service was outstanding! He multi-tasked effortlessly and made sure each customer was informed about their order, and how soon they would receive their food. He even offered  complimentary fries since my order was taking a lot longer. Overall very impressed so i'm giving 5 stars because of him!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. The cashier has no idea what a beef patty is. That's hard to believe considering it is a burger joint."}
{"text":"Horrible restaurant. They don't seem to care about customer service, and very often make errors on my order. I usually have to repeat my order at least twice. I know its fast food - but this place is bad."}
{"text":"They used to have a great manager named Nick.  Their new manager needs to Lear customer service.   When my order was not filled currently Scotts reply was to explain their procedure.   No apology    Contacted the regional supervisor.  I get the feeling they don't care about customer service or the product.   I will spend my money elsewhere"}
{"text":"We went there on the 17th at 10pm. We pulled up and they went and locked the doors 5 minutes early. So we go to the drive threw and tried there. We order chicken fries and he says \"We are all out\" so my roommate says never mind but thanks anyways. As we drive off the employee at the drive thru sticks his finger out and flips us off.  So now I'm pissed off. We go back around to the drive thru window and ask for the manager.  the Manager did nothing and I have it all on video.   Tried to contact Burger King headquarters but their email site doesn't work.   Burger King needs to be shut down this is the shitty restaurant ever!  FUCK YOU Burger King"}
{"text":"As usual Burger King is out of ketchup!! I wish I could give it some negative stars. The worst thing is that I've been to at least four other burger king's and have had the same problem with the ketchup, but I guess that's not as bad as the time when they ran outta buns!! You run a burger joint; how are you going to run out of the two essential things to run a burger joint?! Plus the bun is always two sizes too big for the patty. Just have sloppy made burgers. Worst chain ever!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG, where to start. Talk about incompetent - this place is the poster child.  First I usually go to the one in North Las Vegas but was near this one. I usually only go in for breakfast and I always order the same thing and say it the same way, \"I'd like two croissant sandwiches - 1 fully loaded and one sausage. A large drink. That's to go and that's all\". I had to repeat this to the cashier 3 times because obviously it was a difficult order (???). Then she points to a special on a coupon sheet and asked if that's what I wanted. I said, \"If it's for 2 croissant sandwiches - 1 fully loaded and 1 sausage with a large drink that's to go, then that's what I want\". She couldn't figure out how to enter it in the computer system so called over someone else. The seconds person asked what I wanted and I repeated my order, verbatim as listed above. This 2nd person said I can't have the special with a fully loaded sandwich. I said, \"then don't give me a special, just give me what I ordered (and repeated it once again, verbatim). Then she said it'll cost more then the special if you want a fully loaded sandwich. Now being a little upset I once again said (with a little attitude most likely), \"I don't care what it costs I just want 2 croissant sandwiches - 1 fully loaded and 1 sausage. Plus a large drink. Make that to go and I don't want anything else. Finally she got it entered. The first girl then hands me a small cup. I said, \"I ordered a large drink\". She then hands me a medium cup and says, \"here, you can have a medium\".  Once again I said I ordered a large drink. Now get this. She says, \"I charged you for a small coffee\". Now I'm very irritated. \"Why would you charge me for a small coffee? I never said coffee, small or any size, in any of the 7 times I told you what I wanted\". She grabbed a large cup and slammed it on the counter and walked away. so I get attitudes because of their stupidity???  I get my order and leave. Driving down the road I reach into the bag and there's 3 sandwiches ???? There were 2 sausage croissant sandwiches and 1 sandwich of some type. It was on a hamburger bun, had 3 sausage patties and some cheese. I look at the receipt and it lists a croissant sandwich with 3 sausages, egg and cheese, plus 2 sausage croissant sandwiches, a hash brown  and a small coffee.   So, after 7 attempts to order not only did they not enter it right in the computer but they didn't even give me what they put on the receipt. The triple decker sausage monstrosity didn't have any egg even tho it was on the receipt and it was on a hamburger bun not a croissant as also listed on the receipt. Plus no hash browns in the bag which were on the receipt. Could 2 people get it any more screwed up?  I didn't order anything special or asked for any substitutions or anything extra... just what was on the menu and they couldn't do it. Plus 7 times I said it was to go and I didn't want anything else, but just before she took my money she asked me if it was for there or to go!!!!!! Then when I replied AGAIN that it was to go and I didn't want anything else she asked me if I wanted anything else. Holly crap Batman - how can 2 people mess up something so simple so bad, plus give me an attitude on top of everything because THEY can't get it right.    Ok Burger King. Read this and figure out what is wrong in this store. This happened on Saturday, April 8, 2017. Serious training needs to happen along with educating them on customer service skills and how to read a receipt. Keep in mind NOT ONCE did anyone apologize for all the screw ups.  Yes, this is fast food but how friggin difficult is it to take a simple order? And how difficult is it to fill a bag with what is on the receipt, whether that's what I ordered or not - at least I would have given them credit for giving me the order that was on the receipt.

{"text":"Open until 11:00pm yet they always close the building around 8:00pm making it difficult to eat at this place at night and the drive thru isn't really an option when we have two cars of people wanting to eat."}
{"text":"They have the best customer service. They sometimes forget some of the food but this honestly one of the best burger kings in Vegas."}
{"text":"Thought I would stop at drive thru for quick lunch, twenty minute later with two cars in front of me waiting on there order i decided to leave. Felt bad for the cars in front of me that had already had paid for their food. When I left the car behind me followed as well.  I stopped here a couple of months ago and ordered inside and the wait was probabley just as long but they had money so I waited. I saw that they had remodeled and I hoped the found some new management and employees. The concept of taking one order, then making that order before taking or starting another order is not the concept of the way a fast food restraunt should be run. Change the management and improve service, clean the inside and you might have a viable operation.  The McDonalds down the block does not suffer from this poor management, just suffers from the McDonalds food."}
{"text":"Just came back from there ordered two for five two fries nugget special....no nuggets i was the only one in drive thru. I worked for bk fifteen yrs but really? We got the sauce though. My manager would've been po'd . Thanks Amanda the cashier and whoever expidited the order"}
{"text":"Why aren't there more in CLT. This is a good location. Hot food. Acceptable fast food service. Yay"}
{"text":"Cuando estas por Olivos y tenes que hacer tiempo, este Burger esta bueno porque tiene una playa de estacionamiento techada. Tambien tiene una descubierta. De la comida de estos lugares no puedo hablar... Es similar que todos lados. El trato depende de la cantidad de personas que haya en el local. Tiene un pelotero, como si fuera un saloncito, pegado al pelotero, que sirve para festejar cumpleanos. Tiene salida por Maipu y por la calle de atras. Tiene como un terracita cuando ingresas por la puerta. Sin lugar a dudas lo mejor de todo es el estacionamiento. Tiene WIFI."}
{"text":"This place is always filthy! Do they ever clean it??? The food is consistently served cold. Avoid!!!!"}
{"text":"I am glad that others have had good experiences at this store. I have only been through the drive trough at this location. Among other issues, an employee dropped my food and napkins in the floor at the drive threw window and then tried to severe it to me while I was watching. disgusting!!!! The next time I went the ladies attitude made me just decide not to spend my money there."}
{"text":"I've been going to this BK since 2008 off and on. From 2008-2010, it used to be really good the food and customer service was great. Over the years, I noticed as a chain they have gone downhill. Because of the fact, that the food is no longer good, I come here maybe like once a year. Well, when I went in there at the end of July, I order the original chicken sandwich and it was overcooked and burnt. It was not worth eating it because the lettuce was brown as well. I took it back and the manager gave me an attitude and said I was wasting food. How am I wasting food when I paid for it? She did not want to give me my money back and after arguing, they made me a new sandwich. it was still gross and with brown rotten lettuce and a nasty burnt chicken patty. DO not ever go to this Bk as well as any location in general. BK just plainly sucks and this location turned me into not wanting to go there anymore."}
{"text":"burger King rockt ;-) frisch zubereitet und guter Geschmack! so muss es sein"}

{"text":"its a classic BK. teenagers behind the counter. same food & price you expect. But they do have one of those new 1000+ choices Coca-Cola machine"}
{"text":"Waited so long to order at the menu box that I just left. They seem to always be short staffed."}
{"text":"I live right down the street and go often that the regular employees recognize me. Today I went for a quick dinner for my family during rush hour. Had some newer employees ring up my card and said they couldn't take it cuz it wasn't reading. I told them they have had to punch it in before and never had an issue. The supervisor on shift said he has no authorization to do anything and they can't help me at all. Had to go down the street to get food and waste my time."}
{"text":"As Getz would say, they F you at the drive thru.   #1- Stale popcorn chicken #2- I have to ask for sauce #3- No napkins -- I thought they had bad service for breakfast, but obviously its across the board."}
{"text":"Awful they are always slow to take drive thru orders. They are not friendly their buns were stale. I was made to sit at the window for 15 minutes (I timed it!) And my fries were cold. Why did I have to wait so long on a very simple order and still get cold fries!? It's not like I order a ton of food it was maybe 5 value menu items at LUNCH time  with no special request. Guess I should have questioned why in a as the only car there at lunch time!"}
{"text":"Ordered the new chicken parmigiana sandwich in the drive thru. As I was paying at the window I heard, what I assume was the manager, yell out \"Microwave that Parm!!\". Being the only one there, I assumed it was mine. Low and behold, when I got my sandwich, I opened it up and the bun burned my fingers to the touch. (Obviously from being microwaved, we all know what that feels like). And it tasted like it was just microwaved. Did not look like the advertisement obviously. Don't go to this Burger King if you want decent food."}
{"text":"fast food made & served by college students that could give two hoots about  their customers...they are incapable of getting all of your food in the bag at the drive through and if you go inside, be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes and still get the wrong order...uuughhhh how hard is it to put fries in a bag??????"}
{"text":"I am going to preface this review with that I know exactly the type of place I went to.  It's Burger King, not Morton's Steak House.  So I get it.  The quality of help is going to be, at best, so-so.  So with that grain of salt, understand that I know these people make little to no money, and are working very hard.  In general I don't have problems with my experiences in places like this.  And even what I do I don't worry about it because I know exactly what I am getting.  But this experience was SOOO bad that I feel compelled to run a smear campaign on the internet and let everyone know just what a horrible experience I had.  I will NEVER eat at this location again!  The woman at the drive through window was such a moron that it is enough to make me go elsewhere from now on.  She was rude, she was nasty, and she smelled something awful!  Here is what transpired in my time with this idiot:  A)  Clearly didn't have enough training on a credit machine.  My card is perfectly good but she couldn't get it to run.  B)  She DEMANDED, and I mean DEMANDED another form of payment.  Well, I refused, because that card is perfectly good and if she knew how to use the credit card machine she would know that if you go a little slower it works just fine.  In fact, the card was used several times earlier in the day at several other places.  Being rude and demanding another forum of payment is already bad but you have no excuse to be at a window and not know how to use the credit card machine!  C)  At this point I was annoyed, but she continued to push me by telling me just how her credit card machine works (by the way I am a software engineer and have worked on PoS systems and she ha no earthly clue what she is talking about, but I digress).  When I said to her, frankly at this point, and I quote, \"It doesn't matter now.  The point is moot since you got the card to run.\"  She then proceeded to stand at the window and say things like \"Wow.\" in rude tunes.  I said to her several times, in a monotone voice, \"Lady, I just want my food.  Can I go please?\"  She wouldn't stop.  Kept on keeping on in a test of wills with me.  She was way cooler then me man, working at a BK in what is probably her mid 30's.  I was doing jobs like this at 16.  Your parents must think you are the envy of the whole family with all of your success.  D)  Finally when she did hand me the food, she said in as smug a voice as she could muster, \"Here's your food, dude.\"  At that point I yelled back \"LATERS!\" as loud as I could hoping everyone inside would now know what an idiot this woman is.  E)  The fries were cold.  And she was so busy trying to how just how awesome and cool she is, she forgot the damn Sweet and Sour sauce that was supposed to go with my kids' meals.  In short, TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES!!!!!!!!!  I really blame management for this.  Managers, pay attention!  LEARN TO TEACH YOUR EMPLOYEES CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS AND HOW TO USE THE STUPID CREDIT CARD MACHINE AND KNOW NOT TO CONTINUE OPENING YOUR MOUTH AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD SEVERAL TIMES TO STOP!  I am a 2 second customer.  Hand me my food and let me be on my way.    What an idiot!  If I could give it 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"Nachdem letzten mal nie wieder! Wir bestellten 3 chickennugget Burger und 1 crispy chicken. Die Nuggetburger waren fast kalt und der crispy wie der Name sagt sollte er knusprig sein war matschig und das brot vertrocknet. Die Bedienung war unfreundlich."}
{"text":"Can someone please explain to me how exactly a Burger King runs out of burgers? They've also not had the new Mac and Cheetos things for over two weeks. Service is slow and miserable."}
{"text":"Wicked expensive for mediocre food. Rude service and no options. $19 and some change for 2 croissantwich meals. Would not sub in apple juice instead of coffee (news flash Burger King not everyone likes coffee!!) no breakfast burritos on menu. When we got our food the tater tots were very hot which was good, sandwiches were VERY greasy which was strange because they both had ham not sausage. Overall did not taste like $20 in food."}
{"text":"I don't usually expect crazy good food from Burger King, but I do at least expect what I order. This is the third time now that I've gone to this Burger King and ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich with sausage and this is the third time I have gotten ham instead. It's not a very big deal since I do like ham and it tastes all the same anyway when I'm eating quick fast food on my way to work, but it does get annoying after a while. The first time it happened, I looked at the wrapping around the sandwich after I'd realized it was ham and it was labeled ham. So the second time I made sure to look at the wrapping when they gave me my food and it was marked sausage so I thought I was good and it turned out to be ham anyway. This third time I asked when they gave me to the food to make sure it was sausage because the past two times it's been ham, and sure enough they said it was my correct order and that they checked it and I received ham again.  I called this location to let them know that this is the third time... Not to complain to them, but to at least let them know that this is happening in their drive-thru and if it's happened to me 3 times, I'm sure it's happened to many other customers. I talked to the manager and was put on hold and then the call disconnected... Or else they hung up on me. Either way, I'm writing this review just to let people know to check their orders before leaving the drive thru. :)"}
{"text":"Not bad the place is a little slow on service. However the food taste better than the other burger place. Good to stop but after and before Vegas. I doubt she will be there when any of you go but they have a girl with really pretty eyes when i was there. i know that was pretty pointless but what can I say about a Burger King that you all dont already know?"}
{"text":"The employees should be more focused on taking orders properly and listening to the customer as opposed to their own conversations. And it's fast food, not take twenty minutes. I was in the store, looked over the menu, got my order, went out to my car, found out wrong sandwich, went back in, got a new sandwich and still got out before the people who were there at least 5 minutes before me... more focus and work, less talk."}
{"text":"So I tried this place a second time hoping for a better experience and who would have guessed 2 out of 2 times that I went to this place I was told the fryer was broken and no fries or chicken sandwiches could be ordered And instead would upgrade my drinks  for the meals I ordered.Really how are all the fryers down on a Fri afternoon at 4:30. I told them forget it and went to the Sonic across the street, not going back ."}
{"text":"I am only giving 1 star because I had to give them something. Took 3 times to get my order right. I do not recommend this location."}

{"text":"Poor poor customer service. I just got back from Cali for my son's vacation and burger king is his fav fast food. This particular burger king has a extremely rude drive thru employee name Marilyn and cashier username Carmen. She rushes so fast rudely and very unprofessional tone of attitude on our order not giving us a chance to get to decide on the next food already asking\"is that all\". No, we weren't in Amy position of indecisiveness since we already knew what to order but I wanted to have a chance to select a new Mac n Cheetos order. No one is behind me not no line. Once pulled to the window, I'm not even face to face with her, I'm trying to get the right amount of dollars for how poor murmuring rudely rush in her attitude tone voice. And continues to ask rudely as if I did not hear her at all and felt at that moment I had to tell her to wait and pardon me while I get her the money to pay for her to work there. So rude!!! She says to pull back to behind a red pull when another vehicle is coming up behind me could of out my two kids in the back of the seat to rear bump drive thru accident, then she said pull over to the front. I understand but why does she has to be so abruptly rude and horrible at rushing customers to order? Especially the ones who know what to order but be push in force of not ordering fast enough? Is this a race or she just hates taking orders? No patience at all!!!! She even forgot ranch and gave small fries instead of the medium meal we order for my son coming back from vacation Cali.   Let this get out to general manager Lara who called in and ask if she is on board. Worst ever."}
{"text":"2 days in a row and no burger king ...  First night the 24 hr. Drive-thru was close so that suck .. Second night 24 hr. Drive-thru was open but guess what the grill was not on and it would take 15 to 20 minutes to be ready to go .. So why even be a 24 hr. Drive-thru if u can't even sell a chardbroiled burger ..  Burger king staff get ur act together ... to provided a service ..."}
{"text":"Keep driving. Only stop if you need the latest Xbox game review; or how to cash your check at Walmart.   If you are eating in don't bother with bulk ketchup, it is NEVER filled. Heard employee ask \"is that thing still broken\" as I walked away from the counter with my ketchup packets."}
{"text":"Well, it's a fast food joint in a casino, what else?  When I arrived I was greeted by a young lady leaning on the counter texting (granted it was 1:30am) once I got her attention it was fair service, some issue with accent/word usage with ordering, she seemed to push upsizing and current offers a bit too much though.  With the meal, it's nothing to bring home, I got a medium BBQ Whopper, which was one of the best burgers I've got from fast food, although the chips were nothing to brag about, they were cooked fresh seeing I was the only one there, however they were very oily and not very crisp, also the tables weren't all to clean, even though no one else was there, so there was plenty of time to clean up.  So apart from the burger itself, I wouldn't be returning, Subway and the Buffet both seem to have better choices"}
{"text":"The service was O.K., but a little bit slow. The lettuce was wilted and soggy on the burger, and they just raised their prices back up again. I guess they think the slump in the economy is over. Glad that somebody is doing better!"}
{"text":"Came here having been here before and received good service. However this time around The burger and fries weren't warm. The drink machine had no ice. The only pro I can think of is that the chicken nuggets were warm.!"}
{"text":"Please listen to these other reviewers when they say that the service is bad, because I just experienced it. I decided to go to BK and grab a French toast breakfast meal...well, I didn't even get to order because the woman working drive thru FORGOT about me!!! This location has 2 drive thru lanes. When it came to my turn, she asked me to wait a minute. One minute turned into 4 minutes then 2 other cars pulled into the other drive thru lane and got their orders taken. So I decided to pull up to the window. I get there, and Tiera or Tiara (a manager, by the way) asks \"did you just order?\" I replied \"no, you forgot about me.\" Not even offering an apology, she asked what I wanted (with an attitude). I told her never mind, drove off, and went to Carl's Jr one block over. My family and and I have been here plenty of times before...they forget to give us the condiments we ask for, or there might be onions on my hubby's whopper when he asks for no onions...no big deal. Today was just ridiculous. I'd give them zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Au Backe, hier stimmt ja wohl alles nicht. Der Laden ist meiistens leer, wenn man mal vorbeikommt. Das Personal ist unfreundlich, muß auch bei 3 Burgern nachschauen, was man bestellt hat. Kommt man dann zum Tisch, ist dieser nicht gerade sauber, dafür steht aber dauernd ein Schild frisch gewischt im Kassenbereich, wo es sehr glatt ist."}
{"text":"This place is a trash symphony. The food is revolting.  Nasty burgers and I got very sick after eating a whopper and fries.  Pretty standard fast food fare.  Shouldn't be hard to make it right. The drive-thru speaker is awful.  It is very very loud and apparently, the receiving end doesn't transmit well because more than once, my husband had to go in and get the right food because the original order was completely wrong.  That speaker is for astronauts. The staff is the biggest problem here.  Several times, not once, not twice, but several times we have seen the staff smoking at the doors and bitching.  It's small town crap and there is no place for it at ANY job, not even fast food.  We witnessed a car in front of us almost hit two employees once, because they were sitting at the curb DIRECTLY in front of the drive-thru window, smoking and yelling and cussing about drama, drama, drama.  The drama part is annoying enough, but if you need to smoke, you DO NOT do it where customers enter. Soo sickening.  It's really embarrassing."}
{"text":"I wish there was a such thing as no stars.. I like Burger King.. But today at 1:20 p.m. Arizona time. I came through the drive up with two coupons 4 Whoppers. I didn't understand the concept of the coupon and the price of the Whopper in the beginning. Didn't take long to explain but the manager came up behind the lady in the drive up and said are you going to get these or not because we need to make them then I stated excuse me are you rushing me here she stated yes and I asked her what is your name it was very rude and seem like a racial tension. Kind of situation and she looked at me and friend her name was Denise or something the Burger King is located on Sutherland and Gilbert right on the corner. There was only one vehicle behind me that have it even pulled up to the menu yet. I left that location and went to another Burger King they explained to me what I needed to know about the coupon. And also the price was cheaper. Is this a racial situation .?"}
{"text":"I think the negative reviews are from when this location was under  different management. Since Linda has taken over, this location has done a complete turn around. My orders are always right and the food is good."}
{"text":"This has got to be the WORST establishment in Rantoul.  Drive thru system is down but you can come in....we are out of meat tonight...I can take your order but you'll have to wait about 5 mins... those are just a few excuses I've heard over the past few months.  What a sad excuse for a chain restaurant.  If I was the GM I would crawl under a rock and hide because you sir, should be embarrassed and ashamed.  I would have given negative stars but it wouldn't let me."}
{"text":"Check your bags before you leave...like every time. I've been here probably five times and they've screwed it up at least four. Either something is wrong or missing almost every time. To be fair, the one time I went back the manager did rectify it quickly and was very apologetic. Other than that the food is always hot and fresh, the place is clean and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru at 9:45 pm this evening. All I heard through the speaker was \"welcome to Burger King. We are closed\". The sign said open till 12am. No explanation. I assume the employees wanted to get off work early."}
{"text":"Have to wait 10 mins plus outside in the \"reserved drive thru\" parking spot every time I order from here. Not sure what that's about but it's annoying especially when you're on the go and have places to be. What makes it worse is that they also seem to forget something in my order about 8/10 times. The customer service is less than subpar. The 1 and 1/2 star rating speaks for itself..... Don't waste your time coming here. Hate this place with an infinite amount of passions...."}
{"text":"We just moved to this part of town and Burger King is the closest but every time we come the order is always wrong."}
{"text":"I have ate twice here and both times I've gotten sick right after. First time was for breakfast and the second a cheese burger deluxe. Not sure if this was just a coincidence but to be safe I'll be avoiding this location."}
{"text":"Ordered for veg burger n crispy chicken sandwich,, chicken was good veg pattie doesn't have tomato n lettuce tooo,, last time it was good disappointed"}
{"text":"I am only giving this location one star because I do not have the option of zero stars. This is sadly the worst Burger King I have encountered. I had ordered three meals wich included two whoppers and one chicken sandwich. Pulling away from the drive through I realized the ranch I had asked for was not in my bag. As my friend unwrapped his whopper he said \" this burger just looks sad\".  Dissapointed I would be experiencing a dry sandwich and based on my friends comment I first bit into my fries. They were not only cold but stale as well. As I sadly bit into my chicken my bun was very soggy so I chose not to eat it. Removing the bun I noticed that the lettuce was brown and wilted. Never again will I return to this location and I do not in any way reccomend any one to order food here unless you appreciate stale, cold food."}
{"text":"Management has definitely changed! Very nice staff and last time I ordered they told me that they had fries that were \"fresh up\" and asked if I would like to add them to my order? Uh, yes please! It was a nice touch. Food was hot, prepared nicely, and served quickly. What more can you ask? Will keep this place in mind when I need a quick lunch option"}
{"text":"Ended up in Elyria after driving way past Cleveland, cuz I was tired. This Burger King was staffed with people and served food that later proved to be digestable. I didn't die, and the man with no teeth holding the door was polite and smelled of daisies."}
{"text":"I live in south Lorain near this nasty burger king and the last 2 times I eat there I got food poisoning and never will I ever pay to be sick as Hell by them! I cannot stress enough on NOT TO EAT HERE! If enough of us stop maybe and McDonald's or rally's will come"}
{"text":"Can't get a simple bacon burger correct, and shut the ice cream machine down at 9:45, your terrible at service !"}
{"text":"Only one of the ladies at the drive-through is nice. Always very pleasant. But very very slow service. You always have to wait at least 8 minutes to get your food and usually is wrong."}
{"text":"seriously! im a fan..not going to lie...much better then McDonalds.  much quicker too."}
{"text":"Highest score I can give for a bk.  Clean, well run, friendly employees.  New or newly renovated location."}
{"text":"This location is unorganized and the employees are not pleasant. All I can say is if you do not like your job do not work there. Do whatever you need to do to find a better job. No need to be rude to the customers."}
{"text":"I USED to go this Burger King for breakfast before I would go to work and they usually give me some old ass food. The breakfast would either be burnt or old. I'm not to complain much after calling so much and getting the whole \"Well we make everything made BS\" I was just fed up. I'm done. I'm never returning to this location"}
{"text":"What a joke. Showed up at 4:55am. They said I got to wait until 5:30am to get breakfast."}
{"text":"I would definitely get another Whopper from here again instead of McDonald's or Taco Bell. I only went here because I could smell the flame-broiled goodness coming out of the chimney as I walked by. That's great advertising in and of itself. There are just those times that I get a weird, sudden craving for a the Burger King."}
{"text":"This is the can't get right store of the Burger King stores. The customer service sucks! When you have to go inside after they messed up your order in the drive thru the person in the drive thru just looks at you and ignores you. I wish there was a different Burger King closer"}
{"text":"Travel thru Boulder city 4-6 times a year and most times stop here on my way through.    It's Burger King, I don't have big expectations but I do expect not to be treated rudely or spoken to condescendingly by a barely 20 something \"Joshua ----the manager\"  Who is quick to school you on their updated 2 for 5 menu.  Josh, most people can read and identify someone who has been promoted above their capabilities with little to no customer service ability.  When questioned as to why he was rude he simply says \"yeah thanks and shuts the window in your face.   Go back to the grill and stop interacting with customers and save your store some customers.   The food BTW, was Burger King, exactly what I expected.   Not bad fast food."}
{"text":"I asked for a fresh hot burger this time and actually got it thanks to great customer service great of variety of drinks good value menu but the customer service was fantastic"}
{"text":"If I could give this location zero stars I would. The inside of this place smells like it was cleaned with an old moldy rag. The floors are sticky throughout and the drink station was so filthy and falling apart.... I felt like I needed a shower after leaving. The lady that took my order was incredibly rude and not personable in any way shape or form. I stood there waiting to place my order for about 10 minutes and she was still rude to me even though I waited patiently. If you hate your job and people that much why are you even working there?! The food was not even worth it and wasnt even warm. Wont be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Spent 30 minutes waiting in line on the one car in front of me.. Only to be handed my 2 sandwiches and cold cold fries. Not even slightly warm. I don't usually go to Burger King for obvious reasons but this one was recently remodeled so I thought I'd give'm a shot. Fail. Sandwiches were good.. But how do you get fries wrong? :(  disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is funny. Stopped at 8pm to get a bacon burger and was told they were out of bacon. Fine. Asked for a double whopper with a dr. Pepper. Was told they were out of dr. Pepper. I asked them what they had and he said everything."}
{"text":"More than once now I've tried to order breakfast before the 10:30 AM deadline and have been told that they are no longer serving breakfast. If you are going to advertise a time - honor that time! This has never happened at any other Burger King restaurant I've patronized. Only this one. This particular location has the most rude and incompetent employees and management I have ever had the displeasure to experience..."}
{"text":"This Burger King has phenomenal service. The food is the same as every Burger King. But the service is out of this world. The ladies who work the ordering thing in give you your food are so nice. My girlfriend and I drive across town to frequent this Burger King just because we like dealing with the employees.if you have a craving for a late night french fries and chicken strips I highly recommend this one."}
{"text":"Actually went in to sit down.   Extremely disorganized, getting everyone's orders wrong.  It seemed like they really have no clue what was going on in their own restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there and we were told to wait for our food but since we had to wait the cashier was super nice and offered free ice cream and drinks friendly worker"}
{"text":"This is sad for such a nice area. Facility is nasty for a Sunday afternoon at 2pm.  Employee at register had a couple holes in his Burger King jacket and as I just looked up, he was eating food off of the line. Health code violation. I could go on and on but why bother, obviously district manager isn't doing their job either"}
{"text":"Rude manager. I asked for a bk stacker and instead they gave me a bacon cheese burger. I told them it wasn't a bk stacker, they said they would fix it. But they gave me the same thing. The rapper was half open."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times before. The food is usually good, and the service is somewhat quick. The bathrooms are clean. The seats could be more comfortable. I wish they had a TV or a slightly better atmosphere for being able to sit down and enjoy a meal. Other than that, the restaurant is decent and I would go again."}
{"text":"Rats in the dumpster. Rats in the neighborhood. Thanks Burger King for the unsanitary conditions and tolerating a public health hazard. What does the situation say about what's going on inside your restaurant?  I don't understand why the city hasn't shut you down."}
{"text":"Worst Customer Service Ever!! Do Not Recommend This Place!! My husband and I were at the window when we gave the cashier our debit card to pay for our order. When returning our card, she asked me if I had a brother by the name of Gilbert. I found it a little strange because I have never seen this cashier before, but I responded by saying \"yes, why?\". She responded rudely and with a mean tone of voice said \"He's the one that kidnapped my niece\" and at this moment she turned around and closed the drive-thru window. We asked ourselves, were we really at Burger King. When the same cashier opened the window with our food we asked to speak to the manager. We then explain the situation to the manager and asked for our money back because we did not want the order. We let her know that it was the worst customer service that we have ever received anywhere. The manager apologized and let us know that she was going to take corrective action on the situation. We will not be visiting this Burger King again, we will not be recomending this Burger King to anyone. The employees they hire, for example the cashier that helped us named Carmen, are very unprofessional and give Burger King a bad reputation and name."}
{"text":"I had a great experience today...maybe because the manager was standing nearby ensuring good service. Order was taken promptly, was delivered fast, hot and correct. Overall no complaints. Typical airport prices but that's to be expected. A good quick service option when you can't wait for the sit-down restaurants."}
{"text":"I understand the broiler is down today but then you'd think they'd make sure the chicken sandwich was good..??..holy dry! I would have brought it back but I already waited 20 minutes in the drive thru...NO EXAGGERATION..20 minutes for the only thing they were able to serve today."}
{"text":"This location is always slow. The lemonade tastes horrible. The driveway is odd and inconvenient. You can only make a right-hand turn on both exits."}
{"text":"The price of there drinks is a bit much but there quality for food is better the the carp Donald's across the street. I would go there more if they were open longer and lowered there prices on there drinks."}
{"text":"I think you'd probably have to be on drugs to find the quality of their food acceptable.  As another review stated you'll get fries or onion rings that are hard and cold, probably at least two hours old. Buns will be dry and slightly stale at times.  Frequently at night even if they have no customers they will immediately ask you to pull forward and wait instead of waiting for your food at the drive through window.  Sometimes they are impatient when you order. You might say an item and if you pause too long before saying the next one they just read your total and ask you to pull forward, assuming you finished."}
{"text":"horrible service, sat in drive through 4 minutes without being acknowledged, no option to just leave drive through due to poor design. another customer pulled up to second kiosk and was taken care of immediately. fed up, I pulled into the line. when I got to the window the manager Deangela apologized, saying she was putting out a fire and could not take care of me. so either she is unable to task another employee to acknowledge customers or the equipment in this new store is so shoddy that it is unsafe. at no time did she ask me if I still wanted food or attempt to keep me as a customer, She just explained away the problem as dangerous equipment in a new store. Burger King You deserve better management, and customers you deserve better service."}
{"text":"I was actually in the parking lot tonight while there were 4 cars in line. They shut off all their lights and didn't serve those in line. Perhaps if they were aware Taco Bell was closed they would have stayed open a little longer instead of turning business away."}
{"text":"Food came correctly and my iced coffee was bomb! Unfortunately it's the typical story of fast food workers hating their job, or maybe there's another reason why the workers act like your being there is a burden. I pulled up to the first window, gave exact change, and he lady ordered me to \"stay right here, okay?\" Okay count my change so you don't have to chase me up to the second window, I get it, but when you count it and see its correct why would you close the window and throw my receipt away, then I'm still sitting there waiting for you to say thank you or at least tell me to pull up. No, my sign was you just walking away, lol wow. I'm sorry, I'm not here to make your life worse...then the next window, get handed my food, and each of the workers slid me a miserable \"there you go\" I don't know maybe it's just me but the bad attitudes made me unhappy to eat my food lol...I couldn't even get a \"your welcome\" after saying thank you 3 times. Oh well, can't win them all I suppose."}
{"text":"We just got done going thru the drive thru for lunch and my son had just finished practice at the high school nearby. As we got to the window to pay, I believe it was the manager who was working the drive thru. I wish I would've gotten his name but his customer service and hospitality was THE BEST!! I wish I encountered more people like him. He was extremely pleasant and polite.  Our order was quick and he even spoke briefly with my son on how his practice was, what position he played, etc.  Just overall a nice man! You can tell he takes pride in what he does. It was great to see and we will for sure be back, I hope we encounter him again so I can thank him. I wish more people were like him. He wasn't fake AT ALL, he didn't force himself to be nice, he was completely genuine!  So great to experience this kind of encounter in an industry that is rushed and left with little time to extend good service. Keep up the great service! :-)"}
{"text":"Went through drive thru for lunch,received wrong order, called back and I was told to come back at a later time and I would receive the right order free of charge,  came back later that day and basically was told the girl that told me that was not a manager and was not able to make that decision,  and that they would only meet me half way, i had the receipt, I felt like they didn't even believe me, felt like an idiot and that I was in the wrong.. i will never go back to that location."}
{"text":"ordered the new A-1 bacon double cheese burger at 5.99 got home and there was no bacon. very disapointed. will return for my money back tomorrow"}
{"text":"Okay so first of all you want $15 an hour?? For what so you can still mess up my order? First off I asked for no whip cream on my shake and then they put whip cream. Second I asked for my gr chicken Sandwich with only mayo. I get home they put no mayo and added lettuce and tomato. Then on my boyfriends burger he asked for no pickels and they put pickels on there... Are you serious? How hard is it to get an order right?"}
{"text":"I decided to drive thru and get the sandwich special they've been spending thousands of dollars advertising, the whopper and crispy chicken for $6.  So, I order, drive up to the window, pay and the attendant asks me to drive over to the driveway to wait.  Okay.  There's a car there already.  So, after a couple minutes, I look at the time on my car radio.  More cars drive over to wait, including two in disabled spaces.  Food comes out for two vehicles who drove up after I did.  Finally, after 16 minutes I go into the store.  The attendant is walking out with an armful of bags of food.  I say I want my money back.  He says here's your food.  The manager had to refund.  (so was my food sitting there until they had a whole armful to deliver? I go to the counter and have to wait while the manager is talking baby talk to a little girl at the cookie dispenser.  Finally I say I want my money back, I've been waiting 16 minutes and she starts arguing with me about how long I've waited.  She says chicken takes 5 1/2 minutes  (gee that only leaves 11 minutes to wrap the sandwich).  This was in the middle of the afternoon, not rush hour! I ask if it's their practice to direct people to park in disabled spots.  She says I can leave.  I say I should call the cops about the illegal parking.  So when I get home I call their 866 number, which is connected to Mumbai and it's so noisy I can't hear and say I want a supervisor to call back.  Three hours later someone from the local store calls and gives the usual b.s., disappointed in their handling of it, will coach their staff, blah blah blah.  As someone else has said, beware of the rats.  A TV news story focused on their dumpsters there and the vermin infesting the neighborhood.  I told the apologist I will keep an eye on the place and if I see them directing people to the disabled spots I will video it and call the cops and give to the TV station."}
{"text":"I usually don't eat fast food, nor do I buy it. However today my son asked me to get him Burger King. So I went by there. I asked Wendy what comes on there bacon cheese burger. She replied by saying the same thing that comes on the cheeseburger, except with bacon. I have no idea what comes on the cheeseburger there because I don't eat fast food. I don't appreciate her poor attitude, and I'm sorry I was asking too much of her to tell me what comes on the cheeseburger. Maybe Wendy needs to get a different job where she does not have to interact with customers. I won't be going back there EVER"}
{"text":"Not only did it taste better when I was a kid, but, nowadays, I feel ashamed every time I walk into a BK,  This one especially.  It's dirty, no one seems happy.  The washrooms are filthy. The good is barely edible.  McDonald's beats these guys every time (I feel guilty instead of ashamed).  But if you're on YELP looking for a burger, you're obviously not thinking this will be a great spot.  Just pick Chinese instead.  Mother Dumplings or almost any other of the Chinese spots in the area."}
{"text":"Burger King.  Always loved a good Whopper, still do but, uhhh, caloric limits on my diet don't allow for too much of it, lol. So, I started buying salads more often than not at places like Subway; Arby's (they have a great Farmhouse salad there, I think they call it), even Quiktrip has a nice Santa Fe salad.  I'm talking lunch here, not anything fancy.  Umm, well not necessarily all of those are going to be \"healthy\" if you get all the heavy fat sauces and fried chicken and such on it, I think Subway probably takes it on that front if you want the healthiest thing available at a fast food chain.  So, anyway, I was in this BK restaurant in the middle of a hot summer, ordered up a salad that cost almost $6.  I didn't order a drink or anything else with it, but I had a mug with me that I wanted to put a little ice in for some cold water to drink.   It was actually the manager of this restaurant that took my order of which I had already paid for.   So, I asked if I could put a little ice in the mug.  This wasn't a gallon sized mug or something and it wasn't going to be that much ice.  His reply?  \"We sell bags of ice here if you would like some ice\".  I thought he had misunderstood so I said, no, I just meant a little ice out of the dispenser over there for my mug.   He again replied that they sell bags of ice if I want to buy  a bag of ice.  I was beginning to get irritated.  So, I replied, you aren't going to let me get some ice in my mug?  For the third time, the idiot repeated his bile that he was puking forth, as at this point I was getting plain mad.  It was 115 degrees outside, I just wanted a LITTLE ice for my mug.  I would have even given him 25 or 50 cents, whatever, I didn't need a whole bag of ice and there wasn't anything I could do with it besides filling up my mug and then there would be all that ice and wasted money spent on it.  Whatever.  This guy was a broken record, all he could say was that I could buy a bag of ice.  After he started in the 4th time, I interrupted him, said some unkind words to him I will have to admit and then demanded my money back.  I hadn't received the salad and at this point, I didn't want it.  He ungraciously refunded my money, started to make a comment, but I interrupted him again. Didn't want to hear it, had already heard his bag of ice line several times, whatever else he had to say, save it for another customer.    I don't tend to go back to places that I am dissed at and I can say with 100% surety that I have never been back to that Burger King.  I used to go there 3 or 4 times per week, probably a good thing that happened, lol, get away from that food.  I have gone to other BK's a few times since then, but, I guess that interaction with that manager left a bad taste in my mouth and a McDonald's Big Mac or a Jumbo Jack taste just as good to me : ) 2 stars instead of one because I haven't had this kind of problem at other BK's around the valley."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money here. There food preparation is horrible. My Jr. Whooper looks all messy and fries was not fresh it was cold and dry. They also forgot my straw. I ordered from the drive thru."}
{"text":"Beschreibung von vito corleone trifft es 100%"}
{"text":"Why would i pick a that fast food restaurant instead of that one? Because of the SERVICE!  Doesn't the service add taste to you burger? I mean this staff was Phenomenal! They actually give it to you \"Your Way.\" Food was fast and workers we're very friendly. They go an extra mile just to see you smile :). They took time on the whoppers making sure they look like the pictures.   This specific locations is the king of all whoppers :-D"}
{"text":"I have never been to such a place that can not figure out how to take a order the first time its spoken to them. I was there on Monday the 25th in the morning and the lady running the drive thru irritated me so bad. I had 2 separate orders, she was able to get the first order correct on the first try but that's because it was only 4 things. I went on to give her my second order and I honestly had to repeat the order 4 times. The last time I had to really really raise my voice, I wasn't yelling but it was pretty close. I had to talk to her so slow on this order it was like I was dealing with 2 different people. Finally she got it and I got to the window and she took the money for the first order and handed me back the change. As she did I told her that I would need a drink carrier for the 4 drinks combined from both orders, she said OK. Then not even 15 seconds later she started to hand me a drink and I looked at her and said I told you I needed the drink carrier. Her response was oh OK. Really??? Then she said OK it will be just a few seconds, well for some unknown reason it took 5 minutes!!!! It really seemed like she was 2 different people like I said before. This is not the first time we have had problems here its almost every time. I have finally decided to start going to the other burger king that's by where I live. I'm so done with this location."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Burger King in town. I'm not huge on Burger Kings in general (except the occasional whopper) but from the ones in town, like I said, it's my favorite. The manager is very attentive to his customers and the food can be requested fresh which I definitely appreciate since it actually does come out fresher. Just a clean place in general. Not consistent enough with quality for 5 stars but good enough to keep its reputation up."}
{"text":"Burger King is and has always been my favorite fast food placce mainly because of that charcoal flavor in all the burgers. When you see a burger king and you're hungry, stop there an try it. They're for the most part all great places for a quick snack!"}
{"text":"Mary, the cashier is so lovely whenever I come in. I always go here for lunch because it is right behind my school, Paul Mitchell."}
{"text":"Don't bother coming here very unfriendly staff. Dirty tables and ketchup dispenser was completely empty so I had to walk to the front counter and ask for packettes. Not sure if anyone is running this business."}
{"text":"This place sucks...waited 10 mins to order, waiting for mgr to solve a change problem at register...we were never acknowledged...told her, Kaitlin, we were going elsewhere, she says see ya...also was dirty."}
{"text":"Manager corrected issues noted in last review. .very satisfied. ..will recommend this BK"}
{"text":"I went through the drive through, ordered some chicken fries and a chicken nugget kids meal. I asked for ranch and the guy said \"okay\". I get to the window and ask for ranch again and he looks at me like I had 3 heads, barely acknowledging me. Someone else comes to the window hands me my food and slams the window shut. I look in the bag, no ranch. I ask again for some and he hands me 2. Um, I need more than that so he reluctantly hands me a few more.  The employee barely said 2 words to me and they were \"$8.52\" and \"here\" when he handed me the ranch.  This BK always has bad service and a bunch of yoyos working there. Get your act together and train these people and make fresh food. What happened to \"have it your way\"?"}
{"text":"So this is very irritating last night stopped by ordered one whopper burger for my grandmother and 2 small $0.99 burgers. Simple order huh. I was very specific nothing on whopper but mustard and onions and my grandmother cannot eat any type of seeds in her food so I asked for bread that had without. After they were done goody off, laughing and messing around in back kid asked me would two bottom halfs of bread do. And this is where I messed up I should have checked the bag check the burger but no drove  10 minutes home and the burger was just a regular whopper they didn't do anything I asked to it. I thought now I know why those idiots were laughing about. All those kids should be fired"}
{"text":"This location is OK. I mean, I was in and out nothing really memorable. The people that work there were even keel just treating it as a job. Got my food pretty quick but that's about it."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this location for over 10 years now and I have had nothing but great service from them.  The employees are courteous and the service is fast.  I still come to this location even though I have recently moved about 10 miles further from it."}
{"text":"I've had many problems with the service at this location.  The employees are nice but they regularly mess up my order and the bun's on the hamburgers are always soggy.  They also usually take a long time to get my order out to me.  I'd actually recommend eating at the Burger King on Country Club and I-60 instead."}
{"text":"Pretty ridiculous that they don't close til 10pm yet the children's play area and half the dining area is closed off at 730pm. They must never change the oil to the fryers either cuz everything out of it looks and taste nasty! This burgerking is definitely a joke!"}
{"text":"We have not had Burger King in years, and decided to give it try. Quite a mistake! We even had a \"Buy one original chicken sandwich and receive one free.\" Wow. This was the worst excuse for a sandwich ever! Some type of microwaved patty . Absolutely horrible. The fries were terrible as well. Do yourself a favor, cook at home!"}
{"text":"I come here mostly for coffee on the way to work - consistent taste and I enjoy their iced mocha coffees- very sweet and strong!! inside seating is nice, but ive only done drive-thru- clean outside, reasonable customer service :)"}
{"text":"One of my fav Burger King outlets. Staff is friendly and efficient. Even on Whopper Wednesday they have speed to crank out orders without any errors all while keeping a smile on their faces. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Poor Management! And very bad customer service from the  very own Manager.  African American Female! Couldnt even give me her name.  Sure believe its the same manager from all these other reviews  they talk about.  And of course they dont give you  a receipt for the same reason that  her name will be out there!  Never again will i be back to this location.  I feel bad for the white male collen that works there. He was the only one with manners and customer service.  They really deserve 0 starz but i guess collen was only deserves the star."}
{"text":"Today I did not have a good experience at this restaurant... When going through the drive thru something went wrong and the restaurant only heard my husband's order and not mine.  We informed the employee at the pic up window that I had actually placed an order along with my husband's and it was for a \"BACON, egg, and cheese croissant. And a coffee.\" She gave us our order.  To my dismay when I opened the wrapper on my sandwich it was the wrong sandwich. This was unacceptable. The manager did apologize! He gave me my right sandwich and he personally carried my coffee to my car! If he had not apologized I would have felt very differently about the whole event. But because of his willingness to try to make this right, and his willingness to apologize I give this restaurant five stars!  Thank you Burger King Manager you made an unfortunate event much better!"}
{"text":"So much for \"fast food\". In line to order for 20 minutes....and not even that busy.  Wow!! Won't make this mistake again."}
{"text":"Most memorable service I've had in fast food in 42 years of consuming it. Keisha, the manager, saw another employee bag a value fry for me. It didn't seem sufficient to her, so she told her to throw another fry in there. She proceeded to show the girl how fill the little sack, showed her what the heft ought to be, and carried on with an order she herself had been preparing. Can one use the word \"heroic\" in relation to fast food? She noticed that scant amount of fries in my order while busy with another task. This woman has here eye on everything. Whenever I've gone there I see her looking out for the customer. Wishing everyone well and asking how they are. Burgers are always fresh and service is always courteous at this spot. She hires really good people and sets a great example for everyone. I always believed a manager sets the tone. Really, it's like service from another era. It was a bit surreal. The best person I've ever seen affiliated with Burger King. Hope they appreciate her."}
{"text":"This place is horrible food isn't great bot is still pretty good though besides the food the place sucks they got cobwebs and they can't even keep the pop dispenser looking nice or keep all their lights running"}
{"text":"Today I go to Burger King at 5:07 and it was a driving through order it was a chicken sandwich the lady the one she took the order from me she was so mean and she  was too bad and two dummy"}
{"text":"This is bullshit. WHY IS THE DRIVE THRU WAIT SO LONG. Currently writing this as I have been sitting in the drive thru for ten minutes and haven't even got to the ordering thing yet. Literally what the fuck takes so long this wait is ridiculous this is the third time I've had to wait in this long ass line because it's the only one close to my house. Not coming here any more. I mean the foods good but the wait isn't worth it AT ALL. Highly DONT recommend coming here unless the drive thru is completely empty. Update 20 mins now."}
{"text":"Write down my order correctly but switched the spicy chicken jrs witg the crispy chicken jrs, and since they were all for different people, 2 people came out disappointed. If you're all about the food and you can't even get that right, what do you have left?"}
{"text":"This one isnt great. Sometimes its ok, but twice now several people in my family ill after eating there. We have sropped going to this location because of that."}
{"text":"This is fast food right??? I've been here 3 times because its close to my house. Every time it takes forever and my food is cold??? What was I waiting for then?? Worst burger king ever!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Clearly the WORST BK around. The food is cold, buns are stale and it is filthy inside. I contacted corporate and they must not care because they have never responded back."}
{"text":"i came in and there was no one at the front. i  hear them laughing in the back. i had to say something before anyone came to take my order."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday April 18th nigh time. Fries were soggy with no salt and burger was burnt. So went again today April 19th night time and seriously had to write a review your staff are ffin incompetent. Behold my burger was burnt! BLACK BLACK BLACK. I couldn't even Finnish the first bite. And same thing fries had no salt what so ever. And ordered another burger as well that was missing even sauce. Will definitely never come back now."}
{"text":"There was a paperclip in my Whopper. that I bit into. They gave me a refund for my full purchase after I drove back there but I don't understand how it is possible to have an office supply in my food. I'm thoroughly disgusted. My tooth and tongue hurt from biting into it."}
{"text":"I was going to the job connect next door and stopped by for a quick bite with my girlfriend. The renovations made to the store were exceptional and the cashier was super friendly. Very good time for a Burger King."}
{"text":"Every time I come to the drive thru they have me wait in the parking lot for my food. Terrible"}
{"text":"Disgusting I found mold on my burrito they don't answer their phones. But please Burger King on Charleston and Decatur check all your food and quality"}
{"text":"Nicht empfehlenswert!! Das Personal ist unfreundlich und das essen ist auch nicht toll.  Eigentlich soll das Essen in jedem BurgerKing gleich schmecken, aber hier schmeckt es unterirdisch schlecht. Ich frage mich wie der Laden noch existiert. Da geht man maximal 2 mal hin."}
{"text":"Like the shakes. Nothing else. Burger King isn't that great but the shakes are very creamy. I only went here 2 times. I know I'm doing a review for a fast food chain but get the shakes please."}
{"text":"This new BK is off to a bad start.  Have gone there about 8 times so far and am not impressed.   Lets list the problems:  One time going through the drive through there were two cars in front of me had to returned the orders given to them as they were wrong. Guess what, when I got to the window, mine was also wrong.  Drive through is painfully slow.  On three occasion my order has been wrong.  Found out upon returning home.  I will always check order before leaving this BK if I ever go back..  Last bad experience, arrived there at 9:50pm and they were locking the doors saying they are closed.  Sign on door showed they closed at 11:00pm.  Will be reporting all of these to the corporate BK.  The only positive I can say about this BK, is the people in the drive through are mostly nice and friendly.  I would think twice before going here.  Shame as it is the only quick food besides the McD's inside of Walmart in the same parking lot, I will never eat at a McD's."}
{"text":"The lady in the drive thru is extremely rude and disrespectful. She has the worst attitude ever. If you dont like your job then quit and find another one. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Parking lot is always empty, that says it all. I don't know how this BK stays in business. My family and I did go there one night recently and a homeless family allowed to loiter in the restaurant made the place uncomfortable, felt unsafe and unhygienic. We won't be going back, we've given them several times to redeem themselves and it just gets worse each time. There is another BK very close, we'll go there."}
{"text":"Cane in for a crispy chicken sandwich and French fries a quick snack because i haven't had any from Burger King on a very long time  Well experience was horrible after 18 minutes of waiting they realized i was waiting in my order they tried to hurry and the starting to screw i got a frozen spicy chicken sandwich NASTY French fries cold  Only great item in the menu my SODA  What experience"}
{"text":"The only good thing I can say about this store is the location. I was so excited that there was finally going to be a Burger King near me. I've mistakingly been to this location more than once even though each visit was as before, disappointing. I kept my hopes up that maybe they were just working out the kinks but they have been open long enough now that there shouldn't be any more issues. Last week was the last time I will go back. My food is never right and I feel like an idiot because I have to recheck my food right in the drive thru before leaving so I don't have to make a second trip. My kids loved (notice the past tense reference) BKs chicken nuggets. When we ordered them from the location off of grand and bell they would always be cooked to perfection. At this location they have a burnt taste to them. This isn't the first time but rather 3-4 times that I've ordered nuggets they had the same distinct burnt taste. I asked last week and the girl in the drive thru window said they only change the oil nightly. Not sure if they are burning everything, every night or they just don't change the oil. So if you enjoy not getting all your food, waiting in line forever and getting burnt food then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I usually never, ever visit fast food restaurants. But while I was waiting for my flight it was the only option. I still don't understand how this places are open in this times. They don't even make a little effort in having better quality, but giving shitty food to their customer. It is disgusting, disgusting the food."}
{"text":"On today's visit was told it's .25 cents per ranch.  I ordered a double cheese plain. Guess the pickles ketchup and mustard is not worth quarter.    Shame you charge .25 cents per ranch, at 750. Dollars a case profit...kinda ridiculous.     Last time I will visit this location.  Horrible CS."}
{"text":"The young thug employees have a better than thou attitude...clearly their lack of education shows as they treated every customer like garbage...just like their food. These idiots let 8 or more orders back up before handing them out while 17 people waited for their food in a hurry to catch their plane. This lack of service would be bad enough, but in an airport it is unacceptable. The manager was a complete mess and looked as if she was on methodone. She was useless, clearly needing to be fired. I sent a long email to the owner, and shockingly it came back undeliverable. no surprise there, they are probably as inept as their employees. I doubt they even care if they get good reviews or not as they have a captive audience who have limited food options and have to eat this swill. I sent the same email to BK corporate and asked for a return phone call....something needs to be done about this. Next time, I will take the time to go to Chock-fil-A and get real food and great customer service."}
{"text":"If you want fast or accurate service, keep driving.  You will receive neither here.  And the staff could care less.  What about ordering a fish sandwich and a Dr. Pepper looks like a burger and fries with no drink??  And after 12 minutes, there was plenty of time to check.  I asked for a refund and got it, but without an offer to remake my order.  Pathetic."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews but anytime I come here the service is horrible and this was the last straw. I come 20 minutes till closing and I get people want to go home but I was hungry after work and didn't want to cook, I pull up to the window and wait, 5 minutes go by nothing. I say hellloooo and wait a couple more minutes I honk, weird still nothing, pull up to the window honk wait and knock on the window nothing lol, pull around front and see people in their cars with what look like homeless people with bags of food. I don't know what was going on but I parked in the front and  the drive through sign was on but didn't look like anyone was inside. Super disappointed and hangry."}
{"text":"This place is amazing not only do they have an indoor playground their paper bags and employee uniforms all resemble a burger. It's the little things that count."}
{"text":"Ok the prices are high, understandable as they have a captive market, but when you give such poor service while charging high prices, well there's the problem.  Cashier \"Zasa\" needs to find another job as retail where she deals with customers face to face is not for her. Surely wont be coming back to this BK.  Although the place has been recently remodeled someone needs to add more signage on where the line starts, very confusing when you have a dozen customers standing at the counter and you have no way of knowing who is waiting to order and who is just waiting for their order to come up."}
{"text":"The food was terrible and they even managed to give me a sprite that tasted like shit. I guess it's my own fault for eating at burger King when there are so many great places to eat in the south side but wow that was just awful. When I want something fast I'll never choose this spot again"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Multiple times now, maybe as high as 50%, where the drive through staff takes the order wrong, puts in the wrong food, or shorts an item. Just was shorted an item again and didnt realize this time until after driving away.  When you ask to get it fixed you are usually greeted with a put-out attitude or downright rudeness. Consistently horrible service since the first week it opened. I'd give 0 stars if that were an option."}
{"text":"This place has definitely cleaned up. Not only is the service fantastic now, but the food seems to be better quality. Ever since they got new management I have seen a drastic improvement."}
{"text":"This Burger King is your typically BK.  Not bad,  Not great.   It did its job for me. The breakfast meal with hash browns,  egg/egg croissant & unlimited coffee was all I needed before my flight."}
{"text":"I went into this Burger King, as I do every day for lunch, to get a quadruple Whopper meal with a King-sized fries and XXL diet Chocolate shake.  When I ordered, the person behind the counter took my hard-earned money and came back and gave me what looked like a BIG MAC!!!!!!  What the fuck???  If I wanted a nasty, processed, non flame-broiled Big Mac, I'd go to Wendy's.  I eat Burger King and ONLY Burger King.  So I politely asked the man behind the counter \"What the fucking shit is this, you faggot???  I axed for a Whopper so get your head out of your Mom's cunt and GIVE ME A MOTHERFUCKING WHOPPER NOW!!!!!\"  Just as I was about to throw a molotov cocktail at the fry cook rather than order something else on the menu that is exactly the same as the Whopper, I saw none other than \"The King\" himself come from behind the counter with my delicious fat-free Quadruple Whopper on a plate made of solid gold.  I realized that I was part of a hilarious hidden camera gag and loosened my chokehold on the girl with Down's syndrome who was refilling the ketchup and moved the shard of glass away from her jugular.  I chuckled and promptly apologized to the employees and customers who I had scared with my voice-raising and tard-choking and happily took my food to the parking lot to eat in my Honda Del Sol as I do every day.  I took my first bite of the Whopper and realized - THERE ARE ONLY THREE PATTIES ON THIS THING!!!  By then it was too late to raise another fuss and I had to get back to my job at Chick-Fil-A.  I am, however, currently trying to build a super laser so that I can vaporize that Burger King for fucking up my Whopper.  I will never forget."}
{"text":"First off I don't eat fast food often, went there the other night and was sick the next day for almost a full 24 hours. Chances you take when you eat fake food I suppose."}
{"text":"Foods not bad, but they have a bad habit of panicking about lines and making stuff early.  When they turn around and grab your chicken nuggets off the rack behind them as you order it is a bad sign.  I now check the temp before leaving the counter.  I'm hoping they get the idea eventually.  Today they had no cashier at the front, because she was on the drive through and I stood there saying 'uh hello? for awhile despite seeing a guy cleaning and another in the back.  Working as a team and covering for each other is not a strong suit here.  '   I've actually walked out of here for this before.   The language skills are really dropping though, the woman got grumpy at me for putting my hand on the card while waiting for it to process and said 'leave card, need to wait'.  They're actually getting worse over time.  It's a shame too as this is so convenient when you get the blue to Bernard terminal buys and need to get a connecting bus."}
{"text":"The employees at this location were very rude and dismissive. Refused to make eye contact or even answer any questions I had about the menu. Before I even placed my order I asked the lady how she was doing and I just got an eye roll and a \"fine\". They took ten minutes to get my order out even though I was the only person in the lobby and there were no cars in the drive thru. I asked for sauce for my 10 piece chicken nuggets and the lady that was helping me silently threw one BBQ sauce container in... I'll probably still be going in though because you can't beat 20 nuggets for 3 bucks lol"}
{"text":"Had the Big King Sandwich and Original Chicken Sandwich. BK is just not that good anymore. A shame classic chains are changing so much and have forgotten what got them this far."}
{"text":"This place is not closed but it should be. I just ordered at the drive-thru. The quality is HORRIBLE. The burger was cold and not fresh. The onion rings were probably sitting under the heat lamp for hours. The soda was flat and had no flavor. Go to jack in the box if you want your after midnight meals/snacks. DO NOT go to this Burger King. This place SUCKS!!!! The quality is waaaaaay below the standard."}
{"text":"If you're looking for better service, try going in the morning."}
{"text":"Going thru the drive thru is painful.  Normally I would leave due to the wait but I had to see how long it would take.  Best estimate is 5 cars ahead of me took 18 minutes.  18 minutes for fast food, hey Burger King, is this acceptable?"}
{"text":"Quick  and friendly service.  Cheap prices.  Great food."}
{"text":"This location is a joke. Long wait times for cold food. 3 different visits over the course of a month and a half, food cold all three times. I was dining in too! The last visit when my food was cold, I was fed up and asked for a new burger. The person working asked if I wanted my burger microwaved. I told them no, I wanted a fresh burger. They make me a fresh burger, and it is still cold!!! Needless to say, that was my LAST visit to this location!"}
{"text":"This place has got to be the slowest Burger King on earth. It also doesn't help when someone in front of you orders $36 worth of food."}
{"text":"Most people will take the time to write a bad review but mostly good service from good people goes unnoticed. I have to say for a fast food restaurant this is one of the best places I've ever been for customer service. Nana was the lady that took our order and even on her way out as she was leaving work. She took the time to ask us how everything was and even engaged in Small talk. Most employee now a days don't care if everything was ok. Nice that she took the time to ask. (We love bacon bits) lol"}
{"text":"I am a Regional Manager for a major beverage distribution company, actually the top beverage company over the United States. While in town on business I decided to stop into this fast food for a quick bite just now.  As I walked in, there were three Employees(one female & two males) at the counter. I said \"Hello how y'all doing today\". No one said anything. I thought to myself, Hmmm ok. I read the menu in front of all three and no one asked me what I wanted or can I take your order. We just stared at each other. So I asked one of the gentlemen if he was ready since he Kept staring at me. He said what do you want? (Something to that nature. I just shook my head and ordered. Still no hello, no Hi can I take your order, no acknowledgment. I ordered and paid then waited for my number to be called. It was never called!! One of the male workers prepped my food then turned around and handed me a tray without saying a word. So I said, oh is this for me? Is it order #29? He shook his head without uttering a word. They all seemed to be in a bad mood. Now you may think this is all nothing but; Customer Service goes a long way. Great customer service I should say. Being a Regional Territory Manager & perhaps Visiting establishments that may sell our product or we even fix theirs; sad to see Employees not going the extra mile to make consumers feel like coming back!! Best of luck to you all."}
{"text":"Ordered my food and they forgot about me! 10 mnutes go by and I'm like where the hell is my food??? I had to go up there and remind them of my order. Should have read the yelp reviews first regarding the service. Only reason why they got two stars is because the food was semi decent. I just hope I don't get the sh**s after eating my food!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst fast food restaurant in Pittsburgh. If you have about 40 minutes to waste, order to be wrong and rude service this is the place to go. They are very unorganized and this place could be cleaner !"}
{"text":"Wonderful drive thru service this morning.  I changed the order at the speaker and added on at the window and the wonderful women was so accommodating. Order was right and super fresh. Thank you BK."}
{"text":"Avoid this Burger King at all costs! I used to frequent this place often, but over the past two years it's become awful. I highly recommend going hungry should that be the only other option. The cheese is always dry, the chicken is always soggy, and the fries are freshly cold anytime of day. I've even had terrible breakfast sandwiches here, which should be a crime. It's not difficult to make a fast food experiences worse but the employees take the cake in that category.  Avoid if you value your stomach and have to have Burger King, try the one at Broadway and Priest, the quality is worth the trip."}
{"text":"I didn't go here until October, though I've walked past here for years, but much to my surprise, it's the best Burger king I've ever been to. You know what you're getting into menu-wise for Burger King, but the art work is light-hearted, and the place is open and quiet, which makes a great dining experience for fast food. The food is surprisingly fresh, and nice quality. They even have an electronic menu behind the counter which is entertaining in it's own right."}
{"text":"Slowest. Service. Ever. Do NOT go here if you are in ANY kind of hurry. No exaggeration I have waited 30 minutes with 3 cars.  If the median didn't trap you in I would have left. This isn't a 1 time thing it is every time even after their remodel. That was cosmetic only.  When you order specify you want your food hot wise it will be cold from cooling while you were in line. I'm really not sure what the issue is. Just be aware."}
{"text":"Man hat kein gutes Gefühl beim essen. Das hat aber eher mit den angebotenen Speisen zu tun. Im Vergleich zu anderen Schnellrestaurants wie MCD od. BK von der Freundlichkeit und Sauberkeit eher im unteren Niveau anzusiedeln."}
{"text":"Burger King if I could of given you zero stars I would have. I have not been to a Burger King in months because your employees can not get an order right. Today, I had a coupon buy 1 get 1 for free. My son suggested we try it again. We used the drive-thru ordered 1 whopper with cheese only the other whopper with lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pickles and mustard no mayo. I get home what do I have in my bag; 1 whopper with cheese only (great) then 1 whopper with mustard no lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pickles. Really, how in the heck can you mess up an order as easy as this one. Then for the icing on the cake. I call, some little girl answers the phone and says, Oh I apologize. It was said with \"we could careless\". Never going back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Burger King in the world because it has so much character. First off, it has one of the most old-timey BK signs I've ever seen. It looks like it's from the 1950s.   The service is comically bad. The staff here is incredibly slow. Sometimes they'll see you standing there and not help you for several minutes. I've had to wait in line more than 20 minutes when the line was long.  And don't even think about making a special request (e.g., no mayo). You won't get it.   When the service is this bad, it makes for an entertaining experience. Honestly. And the staff is friendly, even if they couldn't care less about their jobs."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences ever.  The entire staff was so rude and annoyed to help us.  It started with the frustration we heard while placing our order.  It continued with the drinks they handed us dripping with lemonade.  Then asked to pull around and wait for fresh fries, where we sat for 15 minutes.  Next, food handed to us with no straws; you should have seen the eye roll and heard the huff when we asked for straws.  When we finally got straws thrown at us, we let the lady know we were missing a meal.  She stormed off without a word.  We sat there for a moment and then went in.  You guessed it, they weren't getting our missing food.  I would have complained if everyone wasn't so rude.  You wouldn't believe the attitude I received from multiple people just asking to get food I paid for and didn't get.  Glad I don't live her and won't be back.  If you are visiting, I recommend finding somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"6/25/2016, 2:15pm, Drive-thru. This was the worst experience I've have ever had at a fast food burger joint. Stop to get a couple of burger on our way to the movies. There were 3 cars in front of us. No big deal right? Wrong. Our movie started at 2:40, the theater was 1 block away. We sat and we sat in that darn drive-thru forever. It's 113 degrees and cars a/c's don't perform at their best in that kind of heat when you are sitting still and the sun is beating down on you. The car in front of us was sitting at the order box, they had placed their order before we pulled up. The man in that car was yelling at the order box asking what is going on. We were all stuck there was no way out. I had cars behind me. I thought I was going to lose it. Finally after 20 minutes the line started moving. The people in front of us, yelled at the drive-thru window keep you food and drove off. When I pulled up, I asked if my order was ready if not we are leaving. It was ready. Needless to say we were late for the movie. We ordered the Jr whoppers, they were a mess. The cheese was over melted, too much ketchup and mayo. They were disgusting. In the trash they went. There was a time Burger King had good customer service and food but not anymore. You don't deserve 1 star but I could not do the review with zero stars. :("}
{"text":"Stopped by the other day in the drive thru and the lady stated, \"we're not open yet.\" I asked what time they opened? She stated, \"7 o'clock.\" Advised the lady that is was indeed 7 and she stated, \"yeah well we're not ready yet!\" So I said, \"ok then I'll wait.\" (Thinking it would be a minutes or two at most.) She then told me they won't be open for another 15 minutes when I asked why she said, \"staffing issues.\" Well that's not my issue. That's either her or the staffing persons fault. Turning customers away, turning money away... Nice! Really makes me want to come back..."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location there's never been a time where they haven't ggotten my order wrong or gave me cold, old fries. Obviously I know that it is my fault to even come back here every time but it's the closest one to home. And j know every time when they give me regular Coke instead of Diet Coke... People know the difference... That's why they ask for the diet kind. Please please please have better service in the future!!!!"}
{"text":"The helpful female behind the counter casually taking my double whopper meal order just a few mins before closing with a  friendly smile on her face was enough to forget your in a sketchy area late at night. I very much enjoy my endless options at the soda machine and the clean tables in the dining area."}
{"text":"This Burger King in my opinion is the worst  Burger king in north east Ohio. This is for a number of reasons. For one the service is horrible. There is a total lack of customer service at this location. The employees function as if customers are an annoyance to them. Secondly quality control is non- existent. It is almost impossible to get a freshly made hot Whopper from this place. They seem to function haphazardly when serving customers. And as with so many places they make you feel as if they are doing you a favor by waiting on you the customer."}
{"text":"Drive thru is terrible.  Took 15 minutes from the time I placed order to get the food. Unbelievable and unacceptable. No more! !"}
{"text":"As I was on my way to the gate but my tummy made me veer left and hit up BK.   The service was outstanding this late at night. I was helped by two pretty girls and they seemed to enjoy what they do. If your having fun with your job and are more than happy to answer questions, heck even ask a few, you earn a 4 star rating.   I ordered a Chicken Tendercrisp Sandwich Grilled with no mayo. It took a few mins for my order but I could tell it was freshly made. The sandwich had two warm buns, a piece of grilled chicken topped with a red tomato and some green lettuce. Pricing was not an issue as I expected this to be more than what you would normally pay.   Maybe I caught them on a good day, either way the sandwich was great.   If I'm in this neck of the woods my next flight I'll definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Every time I go here something goes wrong. One time they actually put the hot dog at the bottom of the bag so all the toppings were mushed into the wrapping. This time my lettuce was on the verge of going bad and there was little of it. The whopper was not assembled at all. The tomatoes were on top of each other and the pickles were in a line in the middle. There was very little onion and ketchup. I live fairly close but after these last experiences I am willing to drive to a better managed Burger King."}
{"text":"Well my food was with the exception they didn't know what #12 typically it's double cheeseburger but I actually wanted the Texas Double Whopper but somehow got a cheese burger. They looker puzzled, but correct it quickly."}
{"text":"This BK is efficient and somewhat friendly except do not ask for anything special because Mgr Debbie won't like it...LMAO...file a complaint and then she won't serve you anymore. Ron Benson seems to be ok with this type of customer treatment because the behavior is long over 1+ year!"}
{"text":"I have been pleased with my last few trips to Burger King. In both the drive thru and inside dining,  the staff have been very pleasant, helpful, and provide great customer service. The food was cooked well, tasted good, and presentation of food was good (for a fast food restaurant. ) It is difficult for me to give a fast food restaurant five stars (needs to go beyond my expectations), but this location is pretty close."}
{"text":"YUCK!! Frozen burgers heated up, ghetto staff."}
{"text":"The minimum wage in Phoenix is now $10 n hour ,the menus anywhere should be updated right away. I stopped here to get a grilled chx. Sandwich $4.79. The menu said they charge 6.03 now I know it's just a dollar more but the manager argued with me. That I was wrong on what it showed on the menu. Now really it shows me that they most likely don't take care of the inside of what we don't see"}
{"text":"Okay seriously guys this restaurant is not that bad. I live pretty close to this Burger King and I frequent it regularly. The staff is nice and the food is also pretty good. Like most fast food restaurants there is always good deals or coupons to take advantage of as well. As Burger Kings go, this one is a personal favourite of mine :)"}
{"text":"Went to this BK at about 11pm on a Sunday night (8/11) as it was the only one open by our terminal/gate.  Nice location, however, pricing was ridiculous!  5pc chicken tenders meal was $10.90!!!!   Had to pay it as my kids were hungry and didnt know if there were any restaurants open.  I saw people behind me paying abouT $50 for 4 people!  Anyway, to add insult to injury, the cashier was not friendly, snotty and very rude! It was late and people just want to get their food, no need for the rude attitude!  I wish I can find my receipt and write her name on here... but that would be rude of me... I gave 3 stars for the food and for staying open late  ;-)"}
{"text":"Ordered : Chicken Fries Meal - Horrible. Cold, dry, soggy. 10 Piece Nugget - Worst. Definitely left overs. Dry.  Comments : Worst burgerking experience. First time having left over nuggets to throw out. I understand it's  $1.49 for 10 pieces, but from NY to Cali, this is just a downer. Cashier was friendly though."}
{"text":"The cashier was extremely rude and not helpful at all. I was attempting to use the bk app for the first time and needed some help. There was no one behind me and she acted annoyed. After I figured out the app I went to pay with my debt card and I inserted my chip and she said \"I told you to swipe\" our chip machine doesn't work. I then told her a sign is needed then to block the chip reader so there's less confusion. Overall she was horrible and with a bad attitude."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero, I would. Worst customer service ever. We went to order through the drive thru with no one else in line, and I have NEVER been treated so rude. The lady was extremely demeaning. In the middle of our order, I canceled and left the drive thru. I work in customer service and understand we all have bad days, but treating others with disrespect is unnecessary."}
{"text":"Two orders of chicken fries were stale and cold. Usually good service at this Burger King so I am very disappointed:("}
{"text":"Terrible service, truly rude. I waited what felt like 10min in the drive thru, I had to say \"HELLO\"! for someone to start taking my order And someone said order when your ready! With attitude when I waiting for 10min. . The person that took my order was very rude the lack of customer service. When I pulled up to pay the cashier Cassandra who took my order, then started to shout out a co-worker name (CARLOS!!!!!) her head out the window and almost inside my car. Poor quality of customer service. I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I like BK for their superior chicken nuggets, my initials and onion rings compared to the Golden Arches next door.    This store has the latest design, is clean and although Fox News is on both of their TV's, one doesn't have to pick a seat in site of it.    It's likely the franchise owner's politics but an establishment like this should have less partisan local channels on instead of one with racial and sexual harassment issues."}
{"text":"I was here on March 25th and had the worst ever chicken sandwich of my life. Stay away from the chicken sandwiches here. It was hard, and had a horrible aftertaste. Gross."}
{"text":"We were having a craving for a burger, just a night where you cast away all dietary sense, so we stopped here. As others have stated, this place is beyond dirty: the floors, bathrooms, and employees. The employee (a male) who took our order had weeks worth of food covering his shirt. He was rude and haphazard in appearance. We ordered two whoppers and some french fries. The only redeeming quality about the food was at least the fries were fresh. However, the whoppers were cold. We took them back up and told the crew that the whoppers were cold. They prepared \"new\" ones and then, to my astonishment, asked me if I wanted them put in the microwave! What?! What happened to fresh? They put them in the microwave which made them just uneatable. We couldn't finish them. Completely disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"That Burger King location has been there a long time, great place to hit after a night of drinking lol"}
{"text":"Uuugggh!  I give up! All of my childhood favorites have fallen. I have gotten better burgers from the vending machine at work.  Customer service was okay, polite, but the food was bad. The was during lunch, 12p, the sandwich was cold, room temp, the bread was hard, and fries were soft. This was not a value meal."}
{"text":"I've been here before. The managers act like the care about the business and are professional. Store had a 98.2 today. Cashier was polite and food was on par. Oh, I actually saw someone wipe down the tables!!"}
{"text":"We did receive an apology, however not enough for getting sick. Do not order chicken from here!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst fast food restaurant I've ever been to. The management is terrible, customer service is lacking, and I've NEVER had a satisfactory experience. I just left and not only did they get my order wrong, but they tried to charge me more for something I didn't want. I called them out on it too. Don't ever go here. You'll just waste your money."}
{"text":"On Tuesday, Oct 24 2017 as we were heading to our gate at McCarran in Las Vegas, we decided to stop and grab a quick lunch at Burger King in the terminal.  Both my husband and I often eat at Burger King when we travel so we pretty much know what to expect price wise.  However, this Burger King is simply price gouging by charging upwards of $12.00 - $16.00 or more per combo meal - the same meals for which we normally pay $6.00 - $8.00 and sometime less if there's a coupon - which, by the way, they won't take even if it is on my app. Is it legal to price gouge to this extent? Who knows, because I've spent the better part of the day today trying to get some answers from Burger King corporate and no one seems to care enough to even talk to me.  Yes, I know this is an airport and not your corner drive-thru but seriously?  If the service was great and the staff friendly it wouldn't matter so much,  or if the eating area were even clean, but none of that applies here.  This location should be reviewed for it's staff and absolutely for its pricing.   We went to Port of Subs and will make that our pre-flight location from now on."}
{"text":"I thought the service was decent up until I sat down to eat. There was quite some customers waiting in line to take the order when the manager starts yelling at her cashiers and cooks. She was telling them that they weren't gonna do something again and she said \"I'll make sure you guys don't do it again\". What I'm upset about is that she could have talked to them in the back instead of yelling it out loud in front of customers, if I was an employee I would be pretty embarrassed and upset. That was just terrible."}
{"text":"The first trip to burger king, I had a coupon for 2 whoppers and fries for $8.99. I added a 3 20 nuggets to order. I received 3 10 peices and my meals. I drove home, realized that was missing nuggets, called and mentioned I was missing items. Lady on phone said come back. On 2nd trip I showed front counter cashier my receipt , she showed the drive thru manager receipt, she said she placed 3 bags in my order, I said I needed 6 bags. She then gave me attitude,  and another lady handed me 3 10 peice nuggets. I drove home again, to find, nuggets stuck together, uncooked. I called to mention it to them and got attitude on phone.  I am not driving back again, for 6 uncooked nuggets.  VERY BAD SERVICE-ESPECIALLY WITH UNCOOKED FOOD."}
{"text":"I haven't however been to this burger king in a long time but its great. I may be thinking of the wrong location, however there is a Burger King on Val Vista, and that one closed and became a Raising Canes. It may be this location but I apologize if it is the wrong one."}
{"text":"If you don't mind being ripped off by the ridiculously high prices...completely out of line high prices... This is the place to go.  $4.00 for a soda...  Just so ridiculous that it's funny!!!!!"}
{"text":"I took my kids here and their playground is cool:) had some coupons for some sweet deals as well!"}
{"text":"Food was cold, at lunch time. I tried 3x to get hot or even warm food, plus it took forever. The young lady that took my ,only at drive thru was great though and cold food isn't her fault. So if you want great people to serve you and enjoy cold food then be my guest, try the drive thru at lunch!"}
{"text":"Bug crawled out of napkin dispenser. Flies all over dining room. Floors dirty. Burgers cold."}
{"text":"Armando was my drive through cashier. He made sure everything was correct, asked me if I need any condiments. I left leaving with confident my food was made to order. I got home and my family were more then happy from the still hot crispy fries to the delicious burgers. Thank you Armando and cooks!"}
{"text":"So soll es sein frisch und heiß"}
{"text":"Really? You have a wet floor sign blocking drive thru? And a handwritten sign on the door? Your closes at 330pm on a damn Friday?! Idiots must run this location!!!"}
{"text":"Saw the complaint and backlash about the posting about BK last week. Decided to check it our for myself and heres how it went. Went in the the lobby at 12:18pm on Sunday and waited for 4 minutes for someone to come out to the counter and take my order. When asked what I want I said \" A number five with onion rings for here please\". I was asked again what I would like and I relied \" A number five with onion rings for here please.\" She was typing in my order and said is that to go? Huh..... I replied for the third time it was here. She finished my order and handed me my cup. As a note I was the only customer in the place and no one was at the drive through. I proceeded to get my drink and the machine just kept dispensing the soda, I had the bang the button three times to get it to stop. My order was filled and I had to go back to get the french fries replaced with onion rings as ordered (3x). The place was dirty, the drink area was a mess, the ketchup station was overflowing with ketchup. My burger was coved with enough mustard that I did not finish it. As i wa getting ready to clean up my tray and leave another customer came in and waited for service. He yelled twice for someone with no response. the only person visible was the cook and he couldn't help because his language skills were very limited. I left and went to my car and returned to take a photo the windows sticker that said we want to know how we're doing. The man was still waiting alone at the counter and by this time is was almost 7 minutes. I logged into the website on the windows sticker only to get an error because the page had a programming problem on line 1 of the code. There was no excuse for the place to be a mess, there were no customers and only 1 car went through the drive thru while I was there. Why did I not lodge a complaint with the manager? I didn't have a whole afternoon to waste trying to find someone."}
{"text":"Overpriced airport food.  Quality is questionable.  Staff is nice. Stale buns and chewy burgers.  Unfortunately, they have a captive audience so there is no incentive to change."}
{"text":"Okay It's funny that I'm giving 5 stars to Burger King but I really have never liked BK until we moved near this one. I use to always opt for McD's.  This restaurant is always clean, The people there are always nice. The food I order is always exactly what I ordered. It is always hot, the fries are even always good. I have been here about 10 times or so in the last year that I've lived here and no matter the time of day I go (sometimes noon, sometimes dinner, and sometimes 11pm late night) the quality of the food is always consistent. Good enough to write a review about!"}
{"text":"WARNING: BEWARE OF THE NUGGETS  We went there earlier in June. Now I'm not originally from Madison so I don't know if there were previous establishments before that Burger King, but the placing of the drive thru was weird. You have to drive around the shared parking lot to get to the menu and speaker, placed along the fence.   When we pulled up to the window, the cashier handed us our drinks...with about two inches of air between the liquid and the lid. Then another employee  told us to move to the curb and they would bring our 2 orders of $1.49 nuggets out to us. I know what it's like in food service, I've been there. You need to prepare more product so you move a car to a spot to keep the drive thru flowing.   So when we got the nuggets, at least they were hot and fresh. We plowed through one box, no problem. However when we started chowing down on the second, my friend asked me to try one because the flavor was off. Sure enough, she was right. They did not drain them long enough so the grease reabsorbed into the breading. Boy, did I regret doing that favor for her. I kid you not, I almost crapped my pants. Like walking down the sidewalk, stopped dead in my tracks, I almost dropped a big one, right then and there. Thank god, I made it to a bathroom in time. When we called about it, they were very rude, claiming it wasn't their problem. All we did was tell them what happened to help the common folks' protect their pants. Honey, I'd rather pay $1.49 for a decently drained order of nuggets than spend more money on a new pair of undies. So if you want clean underwear, avoid this establishment."}
{"text":"I got to admit this location is pretty fucking gross. My boyfriend and I got milk shakes and they tasted like complete shit. It tastes like spoiled milk or just that the lazy fucks that work there don't clean the machine. Burger King your going down hill!!!"}
{"text":"Worst burgerking I have been through was forced to wait 30 minutes for my food and it was soggy when I received it they wouldn't give my money.back and the manager on duty wich name is ALINO a young Hispanic boy , responded to me in a very rude manner,, I asked what can he do to make things right and all he said was \"I can't do anything about it \""}
{"text":"Easily the worst Burger King in Vegas.. Maybe the nation. Last night I went though the drive thru because I wanted to try the new whopper, after waiting 20 min. I finally get my order and bring it home only to find out it wasn't my order.. Tonight I go there because I really want to try the new whopper and again after waiting 20+ min. They forgot half my order. I won't be back. And if the owner does end up reading this review then he should seriously consider finding new management!"}
{"text":"Love Burger King, hate this store, they are rude, never get the orders right, more interested in playing with their co workers than taking care of the customer, the food is always stale and way past it's expiration, worst worst worst location ever !!!  I would rather starve than eat here !!!!"}
{"text":"Rude manager working druve-thru window Saturday, Nov. 4th 4:02pm. Mexican lady. She needs to learn customer service, yelling at crew members to hurry up (rudely) and rolling her eyes handing food thru the drive thru. Shakes her head at her customers because crew members are not being supportive. Rude service"}
{"text":"I never get a good meal at burger King it always seems like they reheat my sandwich in the microwave.  All the food is a bit soggie . They get 2 stars just because if your on a tight budget you can always get a deal there ."}
{"text":"My order was announced correctly into the microphone. Pretty sure it was correct on the screen. My Whopper with heavy onions had NO ONIONS. Come on lady back there, you have ONE JOB!! Come on BK hire someone with a brain, like a teenager, not some half-witted nana. I'm TRUSTING you to get my burger CORRECT so when I get home I can enjoy my burger!!  I shouldn't have to check YOUR work! RAAAAAAAAAAH I'M SO ANGRY!!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive up window today.  Received my order that  included an order of French fries.  I was unable to eat the French fries because of the amount of 'SALT' dumped on the entire order of fries.  Unfortunately,  I was at home when I discovered this and didn't drive back to the location to explain this horrible error, I tried calling the location (702) 547-4944, but no one answered.  I go to  this location frequently and this has never happened before.  I am really pissed off about this!"}
{"text":"This was on the 10th of March, I was with company, ordered the 2 for 10 buck whopper meal, order done all wrong, I gave up on my burger and just took out what I did not want, my friend had her burger redone 3 times and still was not right even after the manager did the last one herself. Girl making the burger did not know English, could not read English (and for the record Spanish is my first language so do not go there) and while I was there a person who was in the drive thru walked in cause his order was screwed up.  Also, the manager had her son there while she was working so she could not possibly have been paying full attention to her job.  Total fail and did the survey and asked to be called back, a week later, not a peep. I made a comment about it on their Twitter site, not a peep.  #NotOneGiven by Burger King.  Never again."}
{"text":"This Burger King is very nice. The employees are very nice. It was remodeled and everything is very clean and wonderful..But I must say that one employee really stands out ..His name is Francisco ..He has the greatest customer service skills, always smiling and happy at the job he does. I wish more places had employees like him. If your looking for great food whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner or maybe just a quick snack, you won't be disappointed.. great service, good value for your money, and great service."}
{"text":"We have stopped by this location quite a few times and it is usually pretty good. The service has always been great. I surprised by the bad reviews. It is SO much better than McDonald's!"}
{"text":"#26 Burger King Burger King is my favorite restaurant. I recommend going to burger king because it is cheap, not crowded and has kids entertainment.    Burger King items are really cheap.  No items are above six dollars,in fact everything is under six dollars. (even the  happy meals too!) The food there is so delicious and yummy!  Next, I would like to tell you that burger king is never crowded. (Like when I visited Burger King in february it wasn't even crowded!) But however, even though it's not crowded the Restaurant doesn't have  lots of money. There are lots of  Burger kings in in Irvine California. This is why I think burger king is never crowded.   The kids entertainment is so amazing! Almost in every Burger king has a playground for kids. It is humongous. They also serve a kids meal! Also the people there are so nice! The Kids meals includes a toy, a drink and some food. The meals are so deelishis!   This is why Burger King is my favorite restaurant. It has great service and I recommend going to BURGER KING."}
{"text":"Jason was very friendly and kind. Our food came out hot and fast. The place was clean and the people were friendly."}
{"text":"Dirty floors, tables, and the soda fountain area was the worst.  Napinks, straws, lids, just about everything there strewn about the counter, some covered in soda that had dripped.  I was going to eat there but after seeing the mess decided to take it to go.  The manager, a younger male, took our order and he definitely lacked basic customer service skills.  As others have said, this is not the ghetto, yet this is how the so called manager acts.  In the very long wait it took to get our food, I overheard several remarks from the employees and manager which were inappropriate.  One conversation was something about race and the Hispanic manager telling another Hispanic female employee to go back to mexico.  Come on, it's not that hard to serve fast food.  I will not return to this BK.  The one on Litchfield Rd is much better."}
{"text":"it surely is the king of burgers, the waitress just leaved me innthe parking loy when i waitexbfor my food so i had to wait a bit"}
{"text":"Went there and the drive thru was closed for some reason. Went inside and only saw 2 people working and 5 or 6 people waiting for food. Left and went to the one on Vegas Blvd just a skip away. There I got what tasted like a 4 hour old whopper. This is absolutely unacceptable Burger King!"}
{"text":"Got a whopper at 3pm. Bread was stale. Meat was cold. Cheese was hard and cold. Basically tasted like it was made 4 hours earlier and just sat in a wrapper on a shelf until they finally gave it to me. I'll never go to this location again."}
{"text":"You can be the only person in the drive thru and you'll still have to wait 10 plus mins for your order.  Best thing is when you get your food and drive off 5 feet cuz your so annoyed of waiting and then realize they forgot your fries! Smh So save your time and go to another Burger King unless you don't mind waiting!"}
{"text":"The facility is really nice with two flat panel tv's playing ESPN.  You would think that I was in heaven.  NOT.  It took 14 minutes to get two dinky BK Burgers.  Then they were barely lukewarm and one tasted like chemicals.  The staff are a bunch of zombies out of a bad B movie.  They have no urgency, they have zero personality and basically think that the customers are an inconvenience.   With all of the places to eat, go somewhere else.  So not worth the terrible experience.  The management seemed just as thrilled to be on site too so dont expect if you go and have issues that they will help you."}
{"text":"Horrible cold food. Subway and Arby's are in the same area if you are crunched for time and need a quick bite."}
{"text":"We ordered whopper meals. Both meals COLD. Frys cold. Burger cold. Best head to..any place in the area for dinner. Cheat day fail"}
{"text":"They don't understand protocol here. Waited half an hour for an ice cold burger because someone didn't out fries in so they were completely out at noon. Ridiculous amounts of disorganization!!!"}

{"text":"when i was in high school, there was a local coffeehouse where i spent a lot of time.  it was called thinkers.  it has since been turned into an arabica.  (at least it hasn't turned into a starbucks.)  every so often, i miss those days with really delicious mochas and no responsibility.  but mostly i just miss those mochas.  you will never believe where i found a mocha that comes close to the taste of that thinkers mocha.  freakin'  burger king.  their \"mocha joe\" or whatever you call it is pretty darn good.  and i know it's ridiculous to review a fast food chain, but those effin mochas.  suddenly i'm gushing over a guy behind the thinkers counter in my memory.  ...i wonder where he ended up.  i'm gonna give bk three stars. because no matter how good that darn drink is, it's still burger king.  thanks for the walk down memory lane, bk.  i can't believe you were the one to get close enough to that caffeinated heaven."}
{"text":"This Burger King  is next to Jiffy Lube south west side of Indian School on 107th Ave.   Came here for dinner, customer service was  good and friendly, clean and not to many people which made it nice for the kids to play, without it being overly crowded.   Food is good for fast food. Didn't have any issues."}
{"text":"Lady who took our order was friendly! Burgers seems 2x smaller than before, was very disappointed that i had to drive back out And went to jack n the box instead for more satisfying size for my burger. Also our fries and burgers were cold. 2 stars only bcuz the lady was nice"}
{"text":"Ordered food at 4:23 p.m.  2 whoppers,  original chicken sandwich,  10 chicken nuggets,  2 Orders of fries small and large  (they forgot my medium fries) I wasn't waiting even 5 minutes before calling my number 82. I stated, \"that can't be fresh.\" Manager responded,  \"OH it is.\"  Home by 4:32 pm. The food wasn't fresh as I suspected. Only put in 1 napkin. REALLY BURGER KING. If I wanted horrible service and food that tasted like crap, I would have went to McDonakds"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst fast food restaurant I have ever been too. I went through the drive thru and ordered a 10 piece chicken nugget. Employee on the other end can't hear me but I assume the connection is bad to his headset. Guy hands me the wrong receipt so when I get up to the front and get handed the wrong food I try to tell the cashier at the window. She slams the window on me. She decides to open and inform her it is incorrect. She corrects the order and in the rudest tone she could muster, \"do you want sauce?\" I said no. She did not hear me so I spoke louder. She could not hear me again so I said no louder. Her response, \"I don't need your attitude homeboy.\" Excuse me I thought you couldn't hear me over the diesel truck hauling two ATVs. She then proceeds to shut the window while rolling her eyes. I go inside and demand my money back. Because of her attitude I say I want to talk to the manager. Once they figure out who that is he says he will handle it. I say no because I know you are just trying to sweep it under the rug. I say I want her name. The rude employee proceeds to scream at me, \"My name is Briana Gutierrez.\" Sorry if I get the spelling wrong but her \"manager\" didn't know her last name or how to spell it. Either he wasn't the real manager or he doesn't know the names of people working on shift with him. Overall pretty gross inside. Definatley had not been mopped well. Leftover food on the counter and employees in the food prep area without gloves on. Enjoy this bk treat. You can have it your way as long as you want it disgusting and served rudely by Briana Gutierrez."}

{"text":"Not sure how this location got such high reviews, my stomach is telling me otherwise. I know American society is broken because of our differences but let us come together and hate this Burger King for the better of mankind.  But for real, their broiler was broken so all they were serving was chicken and everything (even my buns) were burnt and soggy. How do you even do that? I'm not even mad, I'm impressed! Anyway. Don't eat at Burger King when in and out is across the street."}
{"text":"Never eaten here.  First time I pull up, their drive thru box is broken, as well as the credit card machine.  Cash only and they're out of fries.  Not a big deal, but didn't have cash.  Second time I pull up, drive thru box is STILL broken!!  I wait 15 minutes to get to the window to order.  Five minutes pass and no one has come to the window to take my order.  I wait three more minutes before driving away.  There were at least five cars behind me.  Can't imagine how long it took them to get food...    Just today, I was told this restaurant has a SEVERE rat infestation. A home behind this restaurant had to deal with about 300 rats nesting behind their garage.  Madison Public Health Department had Burger King hire a pest control company. They have been putting out poison for the past few days and have had to refill the blocks at a very high rate.  Enough has been eaten to kill about 200 mice. The poison kills the rats in 4-5 days.  They/their fleas can carry diseases, though, which may be contaminating their food.  Huge populations of rats don't just appear overnight.  This is a new level of negligence on Burger King's part.  To hammer in the seriousness of this, the city has had to set up traps behind Burger King and the surrounding homes.  Many dead rats have already been found.  I recommend avoiding this restaurant AT ALL COSTS!  I, for one, will never be eating here."}
{"text":"Very clean and new drink system that has about a hundred different drink options and the staff is very friendly and helpful good mango smoothies just ask for 3 scoops of mangos instead of two."}
{"text":"Whopper was dry. Fries were cold. Iced tea was flavorless.  There was also a creepy old lady just sitting in there talking to everyone as they walked by. I didn't respond to her and she proceeded to stare at me the whole time I was sitting there. She also went over to a family with a little boy to tell them \"he's so cute I just want to snatch him up and take him away with me\". Um, okay. If I was that boy's parents I'd have gotten out of there as fast as I could.  Management: do us a favor and make the creepy people leave the place if they're not there to eat. Thank you."}

{"text":"I came to this Burger King this morning and was blown away with awesome service by the 3 ladies I came in contact with. It's hard to get this kind of service at fast food now a days, but you have earned a customer. To the manager on duty, I applaud you with he help you have hired.   Please promote the 3 ladies as they know how to earn customers and set the bar. Wish I had the names to give shout outs!"}
{"text":"WORST Burger King EVER!!! I thought like the previous reviewer that all Burger Kings are alike. For some reason this is not the case and the burger king in fountain hills is only consistent for SUCKING and SCREWING UP YOUR ORDER and never bringing it to you when they tell you to wait outside. I have had the misfortune to eat at this one over the past few years and it sucks even more now that they did this big fancy remodel than before. Here is a tip: Dont waste a bunch of money on some expensive remodel and then expect to stay in business giving people crappy COLD and OLD fries that they have to wait 15 minutes for. This place sucks. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab a quick bite for my son.  He said it was good so I guess that means it's A-OK.  Access to the center is a bit confusing and it looks like they're attempting a refresh for the strip mall behind it."}
{"text":"Dear Burger King Manager at 2318 W Northern Ave: My fiancé is too kind to write this, but I am not. Yesterday (October 9th, 2013) a few Special Needs Adults came into your Fine Dining Establishment, supervised by my fiancé and his coworker. While it's true, one of these Special Needs Adults does have an issue with body odor, I expect he isn't the first to enter your Fine Dining Establishment with such a problem. They do landscaping work during the day in Phoenix, and don't have time to run home for a shower before sitting down for a burger and fries at your Fine Dining Establishment. I am curious to know if you also ask fully functioning construction workers, surveyors, ranch workers, etc. to leave when faced with the same issue, or if it was simply because these were adults with disabilities? Or perhaps it was because the gentleman in question was African American? I'd like to think you're just an ignorant fuck, but maybe you are a racist ignorant fuck too.  - Liz Petty"}
{"text":"Cold coffee and rude customer service for what it is. Went two days in row. Ring order second day.  It all though it fast food. So remember it's not that important. There employees though probs don't wash those hands. Drive down the block, other places for that fast food fix."}
{"text":"Today I had brunch. And by brunch I mean stuffing myself to capacity, followed by drinking for 3 hours. I still feel buzzed, but, also sorta hungover. I'm currently sitting at my gate eating fryer fresh piping hot nuggets, french fries, and a liter of water. Yes, it was $13. Yes, it's most definitely needed right now. It's the airport. Expect to pay more."}
{"text":"I'm a regular and like the place but today the cashier was so sick I left after paying."}

{"text":"Musste heute über 10 Minuten auf meine Pommes warten, dafür waren sie super heiß. Bedienung hat sich zwar entschuldigt, hätte aber zumindest neues Getränk oder ein Eis als Entschädigung anbieten können.  Long chicken mit Käse war super, direkt frisch gemacht und nicht aus dem warmhalteding."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Very clean, friendly employees, and delicious food! I come here frequently just for their chicken fries and milkshakes and they are amazing! I am very glad that there is now a Burger King close to my house."}
{"text":"Slowest service I've ever experienced at a BK. I came here twice and the cashier was totally preoccupied both times. Been waiting for 5 minutes now as the first person in line. This is supposed to be FAST food."}
{"text":"Wow. What can I say? One night after work I was driving home and I was so hungry I stopped at Burger King. Jesus Christ this stuff is awesome. Flemings, City Hall, Mortons are all childs play compared to Burger King. The Apollo Missions, The Pyramids are not mans finest achievement but in fact it is the #1 Without Pickles. I went through drive through and ate my entire meal while sitting in my driveway without my wife knowing. I should have probably called her to ask if she wanted anything, after all she did mother my child but I am just so selfish when it comes to my fast food burger I couldn't help myself. Long Live My Beard"}
{"text":"I have boycotted this place for a couple of years now they repeatedly messed up my orders and they don't give a toss and it shows probably  the worst fast food joint that I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Ok, it's fast food. I never expect too much. However... My wife and I visited this location on 5-16-2016, approximately 915 pm. As we walked through the front doors, observed a handful of food flying from the kitchen area over the front counters. As we walked in a little further, observed a wannabe gangster, obviously friends with idiots in kitchen, laughing and throwing food from front counters, into the kitchen. I watched the nasty food land on both the prep table and into the fryers. I told my wife, \"I'm not eating here\" and we turned to leave. Wannabe gangster says \"Fuck those people\" as we walk out with idiot employees laughing. I've contacted BK directly and am currently waiting for a call back from manager Chad King. I've informed them to check the video surveillance. You have been warned, dirty food was thrown everywhere. It's sad because this was one of the nicer locations.  Update: a female manager called back 5-17-2016, approximately 1208. She related that she will watch the video and call back."}

{"text":"Really slow. If it was fine dining I would expect to wait :15 for a simple order of chicken strips. But it's not fine dining--it's Burger King."}
{"text":"I like the fact when i go here it's full of friendly people,and really good service. I take my son there and he loves the French toast sticks. I understand this is a fast food restaurant  but it seems more like a nice sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"On the way to a concert trying to grab \"fast food\". Which consisted of a total of 5 burgers and a smoothie. All ketchup only. They  had us pull off to the side and wait for 10 mins for them to make our food and they made it wrong twice.....then we were blocked in by two cars. For an extra  5 mins.  20mins later we had to ride a curb to get out of there.... It was complete crap. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"Tonight we got fresh hot fries and a freshly made Wopper.  This is typical.  I don't know if BK can manage making anything else as they are struggling with the basics.  Food is typically the same as any BK.  Over many years this BK has redecorated and switched things like the restrooms around to no avail.  They just redecorated again and the inside looks pretty good for a BK.  Points for that.  The place is pretty badly run.  They used to be pretty busy at lunch with a line around noon.  I have not seen that for a long time.  I haven't seen a manager actually managing ever.  The people who man the counter are typically satisfactory and get the food out. Tonight for a change the music played was for adults and not teens or strange. So good for that.  They put up a nice TV as part of the remodel and I give that a point too.  There are frequently beggars outside and this is unattractive for customers. Unfortunately there was a beggar at the exit door again tonight.  Cleanliness was ok for fast food. We almost always get the Wopper and fries and never had any problems with that.  Part of their management problem was no wifi for years.  Now they got wifi but tonight it was not functioning.  I didn't complain about it. But you would think that part of managing is noticing when its down.  I also didn't notice a sign about it.  One sad thing is that this place is a fixture in the neighborhood and slowly but surely bad management has killed the business little by little.  Failure to adapt to changes in food taste and general management... I think that the  only reason why they survived this long is because Wendy's and some others gave up during the recession."}
{"text":"We ordered a double whopper combo ( no onions and no cheese )with a root beer and medium fries along with a whopper sandwich( no onions and no cheese , we paid $13.83 . Got home and disappointed to find to regular whoppers with onions, even though our receipt says exactly what we paid for ."}
{"text":"Thanks for not putting any ketchup in my to-go order.  I'm back at the office and have to eat my fries all dry and crusty.  Dang it."}
{"text":"I have yet to have a burger from this location where the meat was hot. A Whopper should not be a cold sandwich. This is a pretty ghetto location in an otherwise nice neighborhood."}
{"text":"Just got breakfast take out here, worst ever!!! I would not give it even one star if I did not have to in order to write this review, I have always liked Burger King, but I will never frequent this one again. Sausage egg croissant: croissant stale, egg rubbery, sausage greasy. Sausage biscuit: biscuit stale, hard and crumbled, egg rubbery, sausage greasy.  2 orders of Hash browns, uneatable, little undercooked sponges of grease. By the time I got home the bag was soaked in grease.  Unacceptable! I threw $12.00 in the trash.  If you are thinking of eating there, think again."}
{"text":"The French fries were wonderful, once I received them!  I did the drive through and when I pulled up I noticed the girl who was taking money was preparing my food. Who knows how much money she touched before touching my fries!!  I very politely asked for a new order of fries, they had a girl put gloves on and give them to me with a smartass grin on her face...  So inappropriate!!  I am entitled to be served clean food!!  A call will be made to management!"}
{"text":"Multiple order issues. But being the forgiving person I am I go back. Just to find out they do not have cheese for their cheeseburgers. I have no idea how a nationwide food chain runs out of cheese. Is that even possible because there's a Food Lion right across the street... Felt so damn bad form almost bought him a pack and brought it to them. But alas - it's a damn Burger King."}
{"text":"This Burger King is located on a corner with plenty of parking, but not in the best of neighborhoods.  My husband and I just made a quick stop over here to get some chicken nuggets (currently their deal for chicken nuggets is back again for a limited time: 10 pieces for $1.49 prior to tax, or $1.60 after tax) because we were hungry and didn't get a chance to eat dinner before driving out this way (we were on our way to check out Glittering Lights at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, which is about 5-6 miles away from this Burger King).   No one was in line on the evening we arrived (last Saturday) around 6:30 pm. Employees who we interacted with were very friendly (each of which had asked us at different times if we had already been helped).   Our visit was rather short, but a good one. We left with 20 pieces of nuggets (which are better tasting than McDonald's).  By the way, there is free WiFi here and also the ladies' restroom on this visit was okay (stocked with the essentials)."}
{"text":"Eh, what can I really say about Burger King? This Burger King is located in the Premium Outlet, South (the indoor outlet, not the North that is outside). I came by here yesterday to order my husband a vanilla iced coffee. I am not really much of a coffee person so I did not try any but my husband liked it. Service was just average. But what is really great about this particular Burger King is that they offer free wifi (not password protected), which was actually pretty fast. So I just poached off of their wifi while my husband and I sat for a few minutes to relax our feet and check our emails and such (I really wished there would be more places on the Vegas Strip that offered wifi for free).   Overall, average experience, thus the 3 star rating.   By the way, this Burger King food court area (there are 2 food courts in the South Premium Outlet) is located right in front of the customer service booth. If you have triple A, make sure to stop by to pick up a discount card that you can use for the majority of the stores in the outlet mall for additional savings."}
{"text":"When my husband abandoned me and my kids 5 years ago I had to find a job quickly. I worked at the other State Rd location and the management /staff there really are sweet and caring--- plus take the job seriously.  This location, right in front of the new Market Place--- has the most ridiculous, rude absurd looking \"manager\". I've gone through the drive thru about 3 diff times when he is working with his orange braids.  Rude. Rude. Rude. Doesn't tell you the total of your order. Doesn't ask for your card. Just sticks out his hand and blankly stares at you. No thank you. No speaking.  I understand that Burger kings and fast food  places in general is a very demeaning and/or demanding job at times..... But ppl!!!! Get this fool out of your restaurant. He doesn't have your or the customers best interest in mind and I promise he is going to start affecting your bottom line.  I've never seen anytg like it. Honestly. And I've worked in Salons most of my life and the women (stylists) there are a trip!!!!! This dude surpasses that honey.  Get him outta there!!!! Bye Felicia!!!!! Smh........"}
{"text":"Alright so im usually never this guy- but I can't take this anymore. This Burger king is bad. Very bad. The employees literally won't greet you, smile, or even acknowledge you. They never give you a receipt when you eat inside, they just tell you your number then walk away. When your food comes out they say the number, plop the tray down and walk away- bad news if you want any side sauces, gotta wave them down and once again they stone cold face you. Drive thru isnt much better, surprised my food hasn't been thrown at me. All of that sucks, but the last straw was today when i found a wire inside my burger. So. Idk. Corporate if youre reading this... PLEASE do something about this location. Its setting very very bad standards. Im only posting this review because I'm over it. They still operate like they barely opened."}

{"text":"I drove to Sun Prairie today to get a Whopper since the Madison BK's are so horrible. I found the Sun Prairie one just as bad. Why is it so difficult to apply the condiments so the cover the burger rather than just one edge of it? Those things are thrown together and when you try to eat it, you find nothing is even close to the center. I've been going to BK's for many years. I just visited one in southern Illinois that was wonderful. Why are the ones in the Madison area so horrible? I guess it boils down to lousy managers."}
{"text":"They have knocked the building over and they seem to be starting from scratch.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Easily the WORST Burger King I have ever been to.  I've been here many times as this store is across the parking lot of the hotel I stay at on a regular basis.  The  kids who work here are polite (that's why 2 stars) but inept.  In about 6 tries they have yet to get a single order correct, and the shake machine hasn't worked since last October.  Tonight I ordered 2 dogs and when I got back to my room there was a single chicken sandwich in the bag.  I give up."}
{"text":"Once again, I have to write a bad review on this Burger King.... they're always weird at the drive through, awkward really.... they always charge me to upgrade the fries but still give me smalls, they forget food sometimes, most of the time it doesn't taste fresh, and they forget the added cheese I always get charged for. I hate paying extra and getting the minimum... There are so many times I wanted to call corporate and let them know that not ONCE in the last 6 visits has our order been completely correct. lol I wish there was another location closer because whenever I use the mailer coupons it's like my food is worse because of it..."}
{"text":"Oh lord. How far have I fallen in life to be a first reviewer of burger king... The self loathe is almost too much to take right now.  All jokes aside (not really) Burger king is somewhat of a guilty pleurae for me. While the majority loves Mcdonalds, and some like wendy's or A and W, I'm a burger king man. It's my go to place for a greasy sloppy burger.  Who cares about the decor, it's burger king. Who cares about the service, it's burger king! I do like their burgers though. As far as chain fast food places go, in my books BK is the best.  Visit BK, if you are drunk, hungover, or just feel like a cheap greasy burger. I think they even have discounted prices at the 'drunk' time of night. Way to stay relevant in the eyes of the people BK."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Burger King I've ever encountered! I went to the drive thru and ordered a double cheeseburger with bacon. As I was driving off I stopped to check it (to make sure everything was correct) and the bottom bun was extremely hard. I took it back into the store to get it switched out. As I get back into my car, I check it once again only to find that this time there's one tiny piece of bacon and not even two patties, but rather a patty and a half. Rather than wasting anymore of my time on such a disgraceful establishment, I tossed out the burger and just went across the street to Carl's Jr. Suffice to say I'll never be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"So excited about a major fast-food chain having a good veggie burger!  Presenting the MorningStar farms veggie patty, not the yucky fake-beef tasting patties, ahem, Boca, such as Fat Burger and sever other places serve. A little over-cooked (hard around the edges) but I'm so psyched that I can grab something on-the-go that is standard on the menu.   Kudos to BK for leading the industry in offering VEGETABLE patty sandwiches on-the-go."}
{"text":"Gave this place many tries. Orders were always wrong, food missing, etc. I drew the line after food poisoning from one of their chicken sandwiches."}
{"text":"Really no breakfast at 10:30? What horrible customer service this place has. Not friendly, slow service, Better take your chance somewhere else."}
{"text":"Backstory: I have this vivid memory of being about 8 years old and on a rode trip in California. We stopped in a Burger King and the place was so vile and filled with flies. Then Oprah rehearsed a list of dirty fast food chains and BK was like #1 or #2 and my mom officially swore off Burger King's for the rest of her life.  Fast forward 15 years and I'm on a rode trip, I was CRAVING a milkshake and saw the Burger King and decided to pop in for a pee and a shake. I figured it had been a long enough of a boycott and plus, this was a different Burger King it couldn't be the same!!  WRONG.  I stopped in the bathroom first and decided I'd pee somewhere else it was so nasty. I went to the order counter and counter EIGHT FLIES just buzzing around the counter right in front of the food while I waited!!!  Ewwww! Will never do another Burger King again, or at least for another 15 years."}
{"text":"Norm was fantastic! He was not only very quick with our orders but very friendly and made us laugh, very cool guy! I recommend this one highly!"}

{"text":"Sky Harbor is overrun with Burger Kings. Been to a few of them and they're all the same, pretty much. It's just like any other Burger King, which we all know is the king of burgers. But this one is in an airport. That makes it so much more exciting!"}
{"text":"I'd have to say this has got to be the worst location! service sucks I love BK and the whoppers so I go often every time I choose this location they mess up my order I get the same thing every time whopper not tomatoes onions or pickles not once in the last 5 times going has it been made right with out having to wait for no reason 5 mins to get a burger when there's no one in front of me is awful! And then today I had my little 4 year old daughter with me and so we were grabbing a bite on the way out of town order my usual and her a nuggets kid meal 5 mins out of town she tell me she's done with her fries but that there's no nuggets in the bag!!! Way to go Burger King thanks for charging me for a kids meal only to have my daughter star in cause she only had half a thing of fries! Needless to say it upset me a lot enough that I felt the need to call to talk to manager and let them no it was awful experience just to find the phone rings no one ever answers in the 9 times I've called and if you let it ring long enough you will get the fax machine! I'm so unhappy with how things turned out today I'll go out of my way to avoid going back to Burger King let alone this pitiful location! It's sad when you can't even get ahold of management or anyone for that matter to let them no how poorly they are doing and to give them the chance to fix there mistakes this time let alone the previous 5 times in the past 2 weeks alone!!!!! I hope the manager at this location actually reads there reviews feel free to contact me so I can tell you what I really think of your staff!"}
{"text":"This place is a JOKE!!! Its close to home and after work i just wanna get home fast thats the only reason why i go there. But you have got to be kidding me with the staff and how they run that place!  First of all, i put my order in and i pay and i am ALWAYS missing something! So i paid for something i never got! This has happened all 3 of the last times i have been there! So in all reality i should get a free meal cuz thats what i have paid for but never got!!! Come on your job to put stuff in a bag and make sure its right before you hand it to the customer is NOT THAT HARD! Specially when it a only like 3 or 4 things...not 20!  Second...the level of attitude and lack of hospitality at this place is INSANE! Iwork in the food industry myself so i have to interact with people all day every day and i know how to just generally treat a human being. And this place is the worst. Quiz time...what do you say when someone tells you \"thank you\"? .........ding times up! The answer is \"YOURE WELCOME!\" TRY IT SOME TIME! I get that you don't earn tips so you dont care about your job that you hate so much...but thats just common interactions with human beings.  I am so sick of the rudeness here!!!! Was burger king hurting bad for employees that they needed to hire whoever walked through the door?!?! Come on BK...ypu can do better than that! I will never go here or tell anyone i know to go here again unless something changes!  Please do something to fix this problem and get my $$$ back!!!! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I tried the whopper burrito today.. it was pretty big and had a kick to it.. spicy hot"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since my last visit to Burger King. I've come to realize how much more difficult it is to go after the cut backs in BK's in the GTA. It wasn't until recently I found a reason to go out of my way to find a BK. For limited time, they are selling 10 piece nuggets for $1.79. I managed to indulge in 60 pieces (never again). As well on Wed there is Whopper Wednesdays where the whoppers are $2.79 or $4.99 for the meal.  This location in particular was a bit of a pain to get to as its located in the busy intersection of Woodbine and Hwy 7. You have First Markham Place Plaza right across the street and a slew of businesses around them. So not only do you get a lot of business people coming, you a lot of bad asian drivers.   The staff were very slow with getting orders as when we arrived the line was literally out the door. They were sloppy with their packing as they kept dropping the sauces on the floor rather them putting them in the bag. I did appreciate that they didn't pick up the ones on the floor and put in the bag. I will give them credit for getting my order right as i tend to complicate things a lot.   Do not go through the drive thru. The line up for that is ridiculous and sometimes goes out to the main street. Their parking lot is pretty small and blocked by the drive thru line.  I guess for the one and only BK in the area, i can't complain. I'd rather this then not have them exist at all (predicting the future).  I would always have a piece of my heart with BK, even when they suck."}
{"text":"Its 7am in the morning and i had to wake myself to write a review for this place. First they had no pan cakes though its in the menu. I ordered a platter with no sausage as i dont eat meat. They made me wait a long time and gave me a platter with sausage. The order was $9 for hash browns. Coffee. Biscuit and egg. Expensive and bad service"}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised by the negative reviews on here... I go here quite a bit and I've never had any major issues like the other customers are having.  Most of the time the food is fresh and tasty but there has been the occasional sandwich that was light on ketchup/mayo.  The biggest issue I've had with this location is when I ordered an Icee and they overfilled it and shoved it into my window and got it all over my car. Luckily none got in the interior but I didn't even get an apology."}
{"text":"Generally speaking the food is great, the staff is decent, and I haven't had any major issues with this location over the years.  The only thing to keep in mind is that the late night shift is a bit slow, even when you're the only one in the Drive Thru. I've sat there for a good 20 minutes before waiting for 1 burger."}
{"text":"Why does the menu say sweet tea when they don't have it? I've been to this location 3 times and 2 out of the three I've had to pull up to wait for my food and end up waiting around 5 minutes. I'm not asking for anything crazy."}
{"text":"They have never gotten my order correct. They blame the \"cooks\" every time. I once went through the drive through, they only spoke to me in Spanish."}
{"text":"This location have been my regular place to buy lunch, and I was always provided with receipts without asking but on this occasion this cashier by name Marvin did not give me a receipt except the order slip to collect my food. I thought he would add the receipt when the order was ready but no, and I didn't notice it until I got home and had to all the way drove back for it. Asking him why he didn't give me the receipt, his answer was he thought he included it.  This wasn't the first time I experienced such unfortunate situation, the first one had to do with them giving me a wrong order, I placed an order for cheese burger and waited all the while for it, when it was my turn I was given a chicken sandwich. If I hadn't checked the food I would have gone home with it. Very frustrating to deal with people who cannot use their intellect, cashier received cash payment, provide balance and give out receipt, that is simple? Watch out and make sure you are not given wrong order, and make sure you received your receipt if you need to. There was too many of such silly things silly people do, I have a long list of those."}
{"text":"Bad serves, terrible communication, only three people, not organized, couldn't give correct change, nobody was at the front or the drive thru and sat in the Drive-Thru for about 3 minutes. Nobody should have to go through that and this is not the first time that it has happened."}
{"text":"Saturday morning 8:51am I order food and I am asked to park up front because they are waiting on the sausage. I pull to the front and there are three cars also parked up front waiting on orders and two more pull up as well from the drive through as I am writing this! Now five cars are waiting on orders! Believe me this is not the place to come for FAST FOOD if you are in a hurry! I won't do it again! Then I finally get my food and to be honest a toddler could have put my breakfast sandwiches together a lot better."}
{"text":"You can get some best offers here. The food tastes standard and good. Ample parking space. It would be great if all the current offers are displayed. The offers doesnt get updated here."}
{"text":"I usually don't review fast food but I just want to warn people the manager of this place, some asian guy, will try to trick you and make u spend more. Yes, it might be a sales tactic, but it strips us of our choice. Most people will probably be tricked, but not me. When I ordered a whopper burger meal, he said \"ok medium meal\" .. I said huh? (Since usually a small is included with the price and you would have to pay more for medium) so i proceeded to say no, I want only a small meal. Then he said ok so a whopper with cheese small meal... I said what? I said whopper meal, not whopper with cheese. I started to get mad. If I wanted the whopper with cheese option I would told you!!! A-hole. I'm not dumb. First tried to trick me into getting a medium without asking me, then tried to trick me into getting a whopper with cheese instead of just a regular whopper. Didn't even ask me if I wanted cheese or not, stripping me of my choice. In all reality, adding 30 cents for cheese and 60 cents to upgrade to a medium size isn't a big deal. But to me it's taking my choice away and tricking me. I hate that. So whoever actually read this, watch out for that guy."}

{"text":"To the general manager of this Burger King location:  Yesterday March 1st at around 8:30 a.m. you had not one but two employees smoking in front of the front door where customers like me had to walk right past them through the smoke to get into the restaurant.  As you know it is against Arizona law to smoke within 20 feet of the door of a restaurant.  Please speak to these two women about this so that other customers do not have to inhale all of their smoke."}

{"text":"To the Manager of this location:  The cancer has now spread to the employees of your restaurant. This cancer seems to be very prevelant with the younger males. The young \"dude\" who took my order today Sunday February 24th at around 4 p.m. Obviously has no basic respect for other people as he called me \"boss\" as soon as he spoke to me!  This is not ok and needs to be dealt with..."}
{"text":"The worst Burger King in town. Won't give you water. Bathroom always closed, dirty floors,Fry's are old. Need permission to get a drink.so people get mad."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for quite few years now and I must say that the quality of this store is going down hill fast. I ordered 2 double cheeseburgers 1 small order of fries and received a whopper a small fries and a soda straw. Well I I realize times are tough but come on really soda straw not to mention not getting the correct food. I can see why Burger King moved their corporate headquarters into Canada"}
{"text":"Well last week we went here and ordered 2 Whoppers, 2 Chicken Sandwiches, some nuggets for my daughter and some fries. The whole order was a big debacle.  For starters. All of the food was cold by the time we got home. We live about a half-mile from here so I don't know if the food sat awhile until they gave it to us at the window or what. Its disappointing eating cold food.  The nuggets were good, if cold. Same with the fries. The sandwiches were all kinds of messed up, though. Both Whoppers we got without ketchup and mustard instead. For some reason, they both were literally drenched in mustard. I like mustard, don't get me wrong, but whoever made the sandwiches went nuts with it.  The Chicken Sandwiches were jacked up, too. They were either fried too long or fried in bad oil or something because they were a dark burnt color when we got them and they were super greasy. I suspect they were fried in oil that wasn't up to temperature.  Well, my girlfriend called and complained and this is why I'm giving them a decent review. They told us to come in and give us two free meals. Well, we did so. We both got Whoppers. Both were made just how we want them. The mustard was still pretty heavy but it wasn't drenched in it. The food was hot. The nuggets were aesthetically pleasing enough to our daughter to gobble down. Most importantly, the manager there was most gracious."}
{"text":"Ordered a kids meal and a burger and fries for my child and me. Both burgers were made wrong. Fries were cold. It took them about ten minutes to remake the burgers which was odd considering the first time it took five minutes.  When we returned the burgers, the staff started bickering and arguing about who did what and why they were wrong. None of the bickering was directed towards me. But no one needs to hear that. Just fix the burgers.   All the staff were very friendly though. Food, once made, was greasy and tasty like it should be."}
{"text":"Just bought a breakfast  sandwich  it was a Little small for six dollars I can live with that but the biscuit was so hard Which was overcooked   window service was good but the cook need more training"}
{"text":"I stopped here because there's no Starbucks with free parking nearby, and I had an hour to kill. The crew's yelling at each other and I fear for my safety (only slight sarcasm here). If I don't make it out alive, keep your family far far away from this place."}
{"text":"I ordered a Whopper Jr. and this is the most pathetic sandwich I've ever seen. I'm so annoyed because I'm starving. I guess they've given up on quality."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service ever. You go through a drive thru, expecting for the service to be \"fast\". Ordered my food ( three double cheeseburgers) for myself and a coworker at 11:30pm and finally got the burgers at 11:45pm.   The girl working told me to pull forward and wait. I sat behind 3 other vehicles for almost 15 minutes while she cooked cheeseburgers. Absolutely horrendous and I would never suggest you go to this location for any reason."}
{"text":"I walked into Burger King and the device was great. The Coca Cola freestyle soda machine didn't have the drink that I wanted but the staff was kind enough to get me my drink and refill the Coca-Cola freestyle."}
{"text":"Obviously, this BK has no higher standards than any other and they're not serving gourmet or anything, but I've never experienced better service at a fast food restaurant (and most restaurants for that matter).   I can't remember our cashier's name, it started with a D, I think, but she was an absolute treat. Bubbling with personality, NOT acting like she hates her job and joking around with us, D is pretty much the best thing that's ever happened to BK. I hope D goes on to do big things, but I also feel like I'll never experience customer service like hers again."}
{"text":"We arrived and ordered three things, two chicken fries and a grilled chicken sandwich. We had to wait twenty minutes to get our food, after pulling into the parking lot. Once we got our food, the chicken fries were very bad. They had a bad aftertaste and seemed to have more breading then chicken."}
{"text":"Yes, I know, who reviews Burger King right?  Every once in awhile I get lulled into a Burger King.  I was walking past this place and saw the sign for \"2 for $5\" chicken cutlet and fish burgers, and that they now come as SPICY.  It was a Friday, so I figured I needed some fish.  The inside of this place looks fantastic for a BK.  Lots of great seating and wifi.  Sadly, my sandwiches were mediocre.  I got a \"spicy\" chicken and a \"spicy\" fish.  The sauce on the chicken was sickening sweet and gobs and GOBS of it were put on BOTH sides of the bun.  Gross.  The fish was missing the \"spicy\" jalapenos altogether.  I guess the girl making it forgot?  But, my paper wrap had a clearly marked spicy in marker on it.  Oh well.  Lesson learned.  I probably will not be back again until some other odd craving or advertisement pulls me in."}
{"text":"Posted Hours says 6am on Saturday but the lady in the store says that they don't open until 10am.  Why bother with breakfast if your not going to open until 10 am.  Ended up at the Bojangles down the street did not regret that decision."}
{"text":"No way, let alone your way. This used to be half way descent for a Burger King. They want $15 an hour!?! Try getting my order right for once. I should've ordered in Spanish probably."}
{"text":"Disgusting ass mexican't Burger king! uuhgg so gross!"}
{"text":"Well what can you expect it's a Burger King. This location seems to be fairly clean in comparison to other BKs. There always seems to be long lines inside the restaurant (15 minutes wait).  The thing that spites me the most is the fact that the men washrooms needs a key but not the women's.  I guess all men are bad -_-    It's a mediocre place to get a cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Way overpriced airport food when a Whopper Jr. value meal (with regular fries and drink) is $9.  Highway robbery!  Did not ask \"Here or to-go?\" just assumed it was to go and gave me a take out bag.  Basic burgers/cheeseburgers were not on the menu.   Tables were dirty and the place was just a mess.  Maybe they were trying to send a message with the take out bag."}
{"text":"This location does not honor the national agreement between Burger King & AARP. I guess a national agreement isn't really a national agreement after all ..."}
{"text":"I had to tell the man many times I wanted the 2 for 5 bk fish sandwiches and a fish sandwich meal with onion rings and a large dr. Pepper. I repeated this many,many, many and did I stress many times. I then quizzed him on my rode asking how many sandwiches and drinks ect did I order. I pulled up paid and there was NO CARS behind me and the guy asked, could you pull around the side and we will run out your order?\" I said no there's nobody behind me and if I go to park I'll have to reverse and go out the other way\" I also wanted to watch them pack my food in case they decided to spit in it. I don't trust this Burger King and I will stop going to Burger King."}
{"text":"I know better, yet thought I'd give them a chance on the hot dog, how can you mess up a hot dog I thought? Had to be the worst hot dog I have ever tasted, be ashamed to be serving something so easy to make yet you people simplified on how to screw it up. Won't be getting my dollars anymore."}
{"text":"they will charge you more than what's on the price of the menu almost by a dollar. i have told their worker to talk to management few times, but still the same. do not go here, they will steal your money!"}
{"text":"They're food is good but the employees could be friendlier. I'd advise you to have a manager take your order"}
{"text":"They tried to feed me raw bacon on old cheese burgers, this isn't the first problem I've had with Burger King. Just go to McDonald's or Wendy's Arby's anywhere save the headache, and potential sickness."}
{"text":"Stopped by just to get some French fries and they were hot fresh and salty just like I like them."}
{"text":"Again with my sweet tooth. Place is a little dirty so not sure I'd come back for any reason."}
{"text":"They always, always always screw up my order since 1997... This time um not going backvto those dum asses!"}
{"text":"This burger king needs to be tore down! Everytime i go they screw up my order literally everytime, line takes forever, i got really sick once and they charge for condements! I guess i wouldnt be mad if i actually had my fries to go with the condements."}
{"text":"Pretty average BK. It shares a dining room with Popeyes so you'll have decent variety in the building.  The trash cans are always turned facing the walls for some reason, and the fountain drink machines don't always function, but overall it's not much different than any other BK."}
{"text":"I don't understand why everyone talks crap on this particular Burger King. To put it kindly, the people that are in there are not the typical young professional/college kid crowd that's typical of the south side, but it's Burger King. I don't know what else you'd expect. I eat here maybe once every 6 months, but every experience I've had was nice. Their kitchen looks clean, the staff is friendly, and the food actually seems like it was made as well as pre-fabbed frozen burgers and fries could be."}
{"text":"It was Burger King this evening for my kiddos. The young man who took my order was very calm and so polite. Food was fresh and hot . Everything we order was given correctly. Since my order was big the manager kindly put my order in larger bags with handles for easy carry out. Very much appreciated. Great service today ! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Ok.  I am going to try and be professional here. drive through took 14 minutes after paying. The new frise are tasteless! The burger was cold! I had to spit it out... drove to wild wings and will never come here again."}
{"text":"What can I say its Burger King!! Drive through moves pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Went thru the drive thru had to keep repeating my order. Got home chicken nuggets were either left under the lights too long or over cooked and cold.  Unacceptable...."}
{"text":"Fries were ok.  Burger was not even hot enough to melt my cheese tho . Doubt if I'd come back at the end of my order i said... that is all ... drive thru man responds that's it ... u want a soda with that?! Uh no that's it"}
{"text":"Never go there unless you like dirty floors, wet burgers, unlimited soda machine with no choices, and a person that takes your order that you cannot hear! Nobody washes their hands when touching money and making food or going to the restroom! Gross!"}
{"text":"Man, that was terrible food. I don't know what I was expecting from a Burger King. I realize it's not gourmet but it could at least be fresh. Everything tasted old & stale, like they just reheated it. Kept me from eating the whole thing which is probably good. The only redeeming thing was the $1 iced coffee. Not bad for $1."}
{"text":"First, let's define this for what it is... a fast food restaurant. I won't review the décor, the music or the menu, since it's a fast food chain -  you can't get your hopes too high.  So, to the food. I've been to other Burger Kings and I've generally enjoyed it. To put it bluntly, the food at this location is poorly prepared. Fries are lukewarm, overseasoned and have the consistency of starchy napkins. Sandwiches look like they were assembled in a cement mixer and were left to sit overnight. Everything tastes old and stale.  Cleanliness seems to be an issue with them. Since it is beside a bus depot, everyone uses their washroom. I don't expect first-class clean, but the least they can do is make an effort. If you go there in the morning or later in the evening, expect to find more flies than fries on the tables.  Service is clearly where they fail. It's reflected in the food and upkeep of the restaurant. At the cash, orders are processed at a snails pace by cashiers who seem to know you will be disappointed. You would be faster served if you ordered food through Uber-Eats. I once witnessed a person come up to the cash to complain about cold french fries. The \"manager\" mustered a meek apology and then gave him fries that she had scooped from under a heating lamp. What a poor resolution - replacing cold fries with old fries.  Don't be seduced by whatever deal they have. You might be getting twice the burger, but you'll be paying for it later..."}
{"text":"The Franchise owners need to wake up!!!!  They own the other location on Main street.  They are both terrible!  This is a fairly new Burger King.  It's no secret how bad they are, since there is very little patronage here.  They have 2 lines and they usually have 0-1 person in one line.   A well run Burger King is a license to steal!  Everyone knows it's not 5 star food. They just want fast, hot food.  These guys can't do either.  Usually they ask you to pull up to a waiting spot and take 10 minutes to bring your food, yet somehow it is always cold.  In fact, you'll be lucky if they ever get your order right.    I have a feeling they just make all the burgers right at 10:30 and just microwave them the rest of the day. Their shake machine was \"broken\" after they were open for 2 weeks.  Their second line is usually open, but they never respond to the person in it.  You'll see people sitting in their car for 5 minutes yelling at the board!  A brand new burger king in this area should be packed.  There really aren't a lot of fast food restaurants over here (at least not as many as Phoenix) so they should be killing it.  McDonalds and every other fast food restaurant nearby are always busy.  The owner needs to have their head checked.  They need to go by once in a while through the Drive Thru and start fixing the problem here.   It's weird they opened a second location when they didn't even care about the first.  If you see the other location at dinner or breakfast, McDonalds accross the street has a line around the parking lot, but no one goes to Burger King.    Just stay away from this place, you will definitely be disappointing!  The King needs to come in and slap everyone that works there, including the owner in the face!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through at 9 pm on my way home. Ordered a Whopper with lettuce, tomato, and ketchup.  Got home, opened my food, and found i'd been given a Whopper with mayo, pickle, onion, and lettuce. After eating 3/4 of the burger, discovered long black hair in my burger. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru 10:14am Feb 23 2016.  Bad bad bad coffee.  Already pulled away and not worth turning back."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING WARNING. I was very sick after my breakfast croissant sandwich. I spoke to headquarters & their response was \" you need hospital blood work & a stool sample to proof it was food poisoning\".  I was sick for days & all I ate was their breakfast croissant. Their customer support has tried to avoid any further correspondence. EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!"}
{"text":"The employees are honestly the worst I've seen at any fast food restaurant. You're in an airport, so you would expect fast service. They're lazy and not at all polite. Also the soda machine was totally out of order, yet they were still charging people for combo meals.  I'm not one to pick on fast food restaurants, but this one is as bad as it gets. There aren't a lot of options at McCaren, but you might want to try anything else.   Also your standard combo meal is over $10. Rarely will you see that at one of the big burger chains, even at an airport."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I think that the quality will improve. Every time, I'm left even more disappointed than before.  Picking on a Burger King is playing to the cheap seats. There's no real point in doing so other than as an intellectual exercise. Everyone and their mother knows that the food's passable at best, the decor is hideously 80s, the patrons are some of the most disgusting slobs you'll ever encounter and \"cleanliness\" isn't a requirement, but a helpful suggestion.  I came here yesterday and had a pack of nuggets and fries. Nuggets and fries. How do you screw that up? By serving lukewarm fries that had been marinating under a heat lamp for God knows how long, and nuggets that are more breading than whatever chicken byproduct they're serving. (PROTIP: Avoid getting the 10-piece bags. You'll feel sick long before you finish them.)  They've never bothered to modernize the seating area or the kitchen, as far as I know. It's still the same dumpy equipment they've been using for the past two decades since I first went so long ago. Staff members have come and gone, but those faded metal appliances and stations will still be there long after humanity has fallen and the cockroaches have taken over.  If you value your stomach, your self-respect or your appetite, avoid this place and just go in the nearby food court. Yes, even the KFC in Dixie Mall that doesn't get your order right half the time and looks like a health inspector's wet dream is a more preferable option than this."}
{"text":"Horribly dated and sketchy. This is the kind of place that you would only visit if there were no other options in the immediate area.  Having been in here in the past, it's clear that the owners of this BK on Burnhamthorpe Road have never bothered to upgrade the place. It still sports the same dated look that it had 15 years ago, with the only caveat being that they installed a couple of flat-screen televisions in the interim.  The food is the same quality that you'd find at any other BK - absolute bottom-feeder deals that only appeal to the drunk or those with low standards. I suppose I shouldn't talk, considering that the only reason my friends and I came here in the first place is because it was Canada Day weekend. They were one of the only places open and they were selling $1.50 chicken sandwiches in \"honor\" of Canada's 150th birthday. Like McDonalds, it's the kind of food that will make you regret eating it 15 minutes after you finish.  The staff are pleasant enough, but you can tell that they aren't all that happy with their job or the state of affairs in this place. And that's not even getting into the weird experiences you'll have with other customers. I remember visiting here years back and sitting across from a husband and wife who continually stared at me as they left the restaurant, Children-of-the-Corn style.  Avoid this place unless you're out of other options."}
{"text":"The people at Burger King on lake mead very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"When you order no onions and yet they still put it on your burger is very annoying. It even clearly said it on the receipt. Why can't fast food employees follow directions on how you want your food made. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Phenomenal customer service!!! Employees always have a smile on their faces.  The food is fresh, very clean environment! I'm a very happy customer, thank you !"}
{"text":"Updated interior. The outside looks old, so I was surprised when I walked in! Just another fast food restaurant, the staff was friendly here too! Tables were clean. And they have that soda machine where you can choose hundreds of different flavor combinations! Food okay, just like every other BK!"}
{"text":"This place is so slow and needs a new crew badly all they do is talk and play around."}
{"text":"Horrible services today from older mexican lady that hand me my food at the drive thru.... I will never go back to this place"}
{"text":"Obviously you cannot expect much from a Burger King - it is what it is. But this location hits ALL the bad points on anyone's list.  The food is not fresh, some of the customers are sketchy (to say the least) and it is filthy.  The Good:  1. Location. It's centrally located downtown across from the Eaton Centre - since there is no BK in the EC.  The Bad:  1. Filthy. Nothing is more of a turn off than a dirty resto - no matter what price you're paying for the food. 2. Food. The food here has most definitely been sitting out for far too long. 3. Clientele. Being that it is so central, there is a lot of unsavory individuals dining/using the washroom here.  Recommendation: stay away!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in to get my family 'custom order' - they happily provided what we wanted, the service was awesome, friendly & fast!"}
{"text":"Awful experience at this location! Mookie is the worst manager, and so rude! I got to the window and wanted to add on onion rings and she was like \"I can't do add ons at the window there's a car behind you\". So she made me get my food and come back around. While fulfilling my order I was observing and not only is she rude to me, she's rude to her employees! Speaks to them with zero respect. Absolutely a terrible manager. I don't see why it was so difficult to add on the onion rings."}
{"text":"Walked into Burger King and saw the cook raise his hands in frustration. Made my family and I not want to stay and eat. He looked disgusting, sweating and dirty. Will never eat there, EVER AGAIN. As we were walking out that guy was still talking shit. I'm pregnant but would literally still kick his ass."}
{"text":"Being opened for over 1 hour but yet most of their items on the menu aren't ready to be served?   Please be prepared for people coming to eat breakfast in the morning on their way to work."}
{"text":"Good customer service actually would consider it fast food n food is always fresh from my experience also here i find it they ask u if u want ketchup which i cant get too many fast food places to do that now days even when ordering fries"}
{"text":"Place is disgusting floors are sticky. Bathrooms look like they never are cleaned. Management and staff are slow and have very little customer service skills."}
{"text":"Smh probably one of the worse fast food joints in the history of fast food. Workers have no clue what's going on. I gave the 3 chances and all failed. Don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"I went at 8:13 pm to store 2701 and they were so cheerful and kind , the atmosphere was welcoming but expedient. Thank you to my cashier for her superb, excellent customer service! I'll be back"}
{"text":"Went to this Burger King and was rudely told that the owner doesn't except Burger King coupons. I wondered why there were pics of people and they said no water cup or no service next to their pic . Crazy place"}
{"text":"I went to this location and they were out of \"Whopper meat\". I find it scary that : 1) They don't refer to it as beef and 2) That when I spoke to the manager to express my dissatisfaction, her reply was : \"So what do you want from me?\"  Wow. Amazing."}
{"text":"Went to Burger King today haven't been there in a while I don't think it is what it used to be not sure if I'll be going back I think at my age I just have more acquired taste"}
{"text":"I am not a fast food lover let alone one who likes Burger King.  Especially with the poor service and food from the other locations in the Champaign-Urbana area.  In fact, I have avoided those Burger Kings like the plague for years.  I have on occassion wanted a Whopper Jr. I decided to give this new location a shot.  I went through the drive through and ordered just a Whopper Jr.  The person taking my order was actually nice and I could understand them - wow that is so different!!!  I then proceeded to the window and the person there was also very nice and smiling!!  Then they took my money then handed me my food.  Just like that.  I didn't have to deal with any rude employee (which has always been the case at the other locations) and my food came out quick like a normal fast food drive through should be. I was shocked!  I have never gotten my food that quick at any other Burger King in my life.  Not exaggerating either.  There has always been at least a 10 minute wait for crappy food.  The Whopper Jr itself was really good.  The first thing that I noticed was how fresh the ingredients were.  The lettuce was crunchy, the tomato tasted good and the onion wasn't overwhelming.  All in all this was an enjoyable experience.  Today, I decided to give it another try.  This time I added a side salad.  Again, the drive through was fast, friendly and stress free.  Again, the ingredients were so fresh.  I totally love the side salad.  The side salad has lettuce, tomato, carrots and cheese and it is the perfect size to go with a Whopper Jr.  The ranch dressing was very good too and all it cost was $3.23.  I don't know if it's because this is such a new facility or what but I actually like this Burger King.  If anything changes I will be sure to post it.  But for now, the only thing that this Burger King and the others have in commin is the name on the building."}
{"text":"I tried the $1.00 muffin they have been advertising out of pure curiosity. I don't like fast food to begin with and this proves that yet again. This \"thing\" was AWFUL!! I only took one bite and felt the urge to spit it out but I didn't. I did however throw the rest of it away. I didn't want the birds to choke on it or else I would have fed it to the birds. Do not waste your dollar or your time on this \"thing\"!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible location. Can never get fresh food. It always tastes like they made the burgers 20 minutes ago and the fries are cold. The drive thru is horrible. Literally every single time I go I am asked to pull around to the front for my order, even if no one is behind me. This is so their drive thru times look better than they actually are. The one time I was not asked to go around front they asked me to back up and pull back up. This was done so I would look like a new customer, again for drive thru times. I am done with this location. Too many other fast food chains around me to put up with that."}
{"text":"I found a fly in my chicken sandwich. I returned my whole meal for a full refund. The staff didn't seem too concerned about it."}
{"text":"It's Burger King.  Nothing really else to expand on that it is a median point in between Las Vegas and Nevada/Arizona state border.  Drive thru was not swift and the food was as any other BK spot would be."}
{"text":"This place has done this one to many times !!! Always on the run so i get the kids chicken nuggets ,this is the 3rd time i taste the kids nuggets and they are stale!!!! Like they been there for hours!!!! Today i called to let them know and guy answers the phone and instead of having some customer service ,gets cocky and sais to bring back my nasty food and my reciept and he'll give me  a refund!!! How about making my order right ????i dont need the money that bad im gonna drive all the way back ,   my drink was all waterd down ,,, they didnt give me the sause i asked for !!! All bad !!! Shame on you burger king!  Never see nother 20 $ outta me! How do i post pic???"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have even had from the moody little demon at the register to the Gm that was basically calling me a liar. I will not be returning to this location ever again and I advise against going here. Not to mention the hoards of flies that swarm your food while trying to eat! Wish I could give negative stars but one will do"}
{"text":"This is the closest BK location for me and literally only less than 3min away from me. I will never get tired of their whoppers and I absolutely love their mango smoothies! The smoothies are well worth it, the right price and portion size is there.. Much better than McDonalds in my opinion. Last time I was there the manager gave me more coupons and obviously went back! Also really like their chicken fingers with spicy buffalo sauce. Try their mini donuts! Not bad at all :)"}
{"text":"This fast food place almost ALWAYS gets my order wrong. They charge me for things that they don't have. The lettuces on the garden salad is always weltered. Besides the staff being EXTREMELY unprofessional, the wait time is always long."}
{"text":"Well... Its just another burger king!  The service was fast and the server were quick on moving the line. The seating is pretty nice. They have a kids play area, which is closed and separate .  There is parking on the location."}
{"text":"Good as far as Burger King's go.  Haven't had any issues there and I like you can get burgers for breakfast, not many BK's do that."}
{"text":"Aww, they can do a lot better for workers that the minimum wage 10 or 11 an hour. Many occasions they didn't listen to me and also received my food cold. Some staff appeared to be preoccupied with cell phone call and texting while my food getting cold. For paying $10 for a meal, l know l can do better at their competition"}
{"text":"Burger King is OK. Are they the best? I don't think so. Are they the worst? No. That is saved for that golden arched place. Their burgers are good and they try so hard. You kind of feel bad for them.  I don't go here a lot but sometimes a Whopper sounds good. They are the underdog you kind of secretly cheer for. The food is good. The place is clean. I like slotted spatula door handles. Service is good too. I like their fries and onion rings. Sometime you just want a cheap lunch and it is right across the street from where I work."}
{"text":"Not very nice at all.  In fact kind a mean.  The food was not wrapped very well.  They just tossed my food on the tray and said.  Here. Goodbye.  Very mean."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Burger King's i have ever been too. The cashier don't greet you or say hello at all. The manager wouldn't correct someone's order without proof of purchase when the customer literally just got his food order. Poor customer service and very unprofessional. Associates are walking around, talking on their cell phones, and looking lost like they don't know what to do, smh. I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I'm writing another review for this airports food department. Within the past week, I've wrote a review on the airport itself as well as the Burger King in the G-concourse. Today I'm traveling back home and stopped at the Burger King in the C-concourse and let me tell you... it's worse that G. KRISTY was the cashier who took my order and she was rude with a nasty attitude. I walked up to the counter and she never greeted me or said hello. I said hello and ordered small fries, one cheese burger, and a small soda. She sat a large cup on the counter so I asked if the cup was small and she said rudely \"we don't have no small cups.\" Uuuuum okay, you should probably tell ppl that PRIOR to adding it to the order to make sure the customer wants a large cup. I handed her my credit card and she said \"swipe.\" I looked at her like swipe what! She pointed at the atm payment machine. KRISTY then handed me my receipt and yelled \"NEXT\" for the next customer in line. I'm sorry but where the h*ll do you guys pick these people up from? The corner of a liquor store? By far, this is probably the worse airport ever. These fools have NO CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS WHATSOEVER!!! The manager needs to be fired along with the entire staff. The associates are ghetto with zero customer service skills. If they don't know how to or don't like talking to people and/or customers, then they probably shouldn't be working at an international airport."}
{"text":"not very happy with this burger king at all. my husband went to get us that 2 for 10 whopper meals last nite. when we opened it up, one of the whppers had nothing on it. it was a bun and a burger patty. no condiments, no nothing on it.  we stopped in there this morning to have the 2 for 4 on the crossanwichs for breakfast and to tell them about last nite. the so called manager looked at me and in not so many words basically accused me of lying. she said that he ordered one whopper with cheese and the other one plain. i looked at her like, really??!! i dont know if she was there or just just accusing me of lying. i looked at her and told her NO, he did not order it like that. i think she just wanted to see if i would go for it. anyway i said what are you going to do about it. and she said there was noting she could do without a receipt. of course we didnt have it. i'm sorry but if i had an upset customer i would make it right no matter what. its not like i was asking for the world. i just maybe wanted a free sandwich or a drink or something. it was so stupid. i told her we would not be coming back to that store anymore.  it just really ticked me off. so stupid. i am not happy."}
{"text":"If going through the drivethrough I would check your order before leaving. THIS BK CANT GET ANYTHING RIGHT!"}
{"text":"I was running late today and decided to stop and get my grandson and I some lunch, I ordered a crispy chicken and bacon sandwich meal and order to him Chicken finger meal paid for and of course we had to wait. I handed my grandson his chicken finger meal and he ate almost all of them except for maybe 3 ,  which is rare because we go to McDonald's and he throws them everywhere.I was impressed by this then I thought OK I'll try my Crispy chicken which usually is soggy from any other place ,I was pleasantly surprised when I bit into it \"It crunched\" this made me very very very happy I will be coming back here ."}
{"text":"I'm really upset because I love Burger King. However this location I am not thrilled with... this is the place where the troubled high school kids hang out! They linger outside and inside the store. I only had $5.26 to spend on food the night. I got a drink. Rodeo burger and value fries. The kids who wouldn't move out of my way while I was trying to get my drink and go sit down while waiting on my food stole fries right off my tray. They workers in the store didn't do anything about it! They didn't replenish my fries or anything! I mean this kid who looked like he hadn't showered straight up told this girl he was stealing a couple of her fries. She said those weren't hers and took them anyways. My food was on the counter by the register!! I am so disappointed they didn't replenish them or kick him out the store. I don't want that kids nasty fingers all up in my food!"}
{"text":"Poor excuse of a BK! Stay away, they forgot my dessert, the food's cold, had to wait a while at the drive thru, plus they don't even have a full Burger King menu."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, the chicken is overcooked, and on multiple occasions the fries taste like they've been cooked more than once."}
{"text":"If there was an option to give 0 stars I definitely would. I ordered there chicken nuggets and I got food poisoning and hour later. I was vommitting and had diarrhea problems that I had to go to the ER. It was not a fun night for me. So please, save your stomachs and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I stopped in during breakfast hours. They told me there would be a wait if I wanted burgers but the food seemed to come up within just a minute. It's just fast food but pretty good value for the price.  They have WiFi which was great because I wanted to get some work done while there."}
{"text":"Tried to order my kids a pankacke plater ONLY. the first girl rang up the ultimate 3 times. I said repeatedly that was not right. She then asked drivethrew girl for help. So we start all over. New girl asked me 7 times the sausage platter. I had to tell her repeatedly no. Now her attitude is complete sh!t. I finally get my order in total comes up i hand her a $20. She fist slams this wad of bills into my hand and walks away pissed off. You would think its over but nope she nvr gave me my cup. I have to ask multiple times. She ignores me till i get loud and yell at her. Then nxt cust had ordered coffee. She has asked for creamer multiple times but guess wht no one gets it. I ask mang for complaint line. All could have been avoided had either employee known the menu, or how to input it. Last i checked i was the paying customer. Im not paying for ignorance or attitude. Clearly the remodel did not include the employees.  Order 86 king #10206 9:11am"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The staff has yelled out the drive thru window on multiple occasions to harass me while I was in the Starbucks parking lot! I wasn't even a customer at Burger King! One time my husband and I were standing between our cars talking and some ASShole kept yelling at us out the drive thru window for over half an hour, he would leave for a minute then start yelling again. We had to leave to have a conversation! One time I bought food here and even after them taking down what dressing I wanted on my salad they didn't include the dressing or the sauce for my nuggets! So I got half my order and it was all dry! The nuggets had no trace of anything that could be recognized as chicken! It was fried dough balls!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. The manager with the last name Dander shouldn't even have that title. 12 yr old kids would have better service then the broads that were working in that joint hahaha pathetic."}
{"text":"This location is messed up.  One of the lady's there is extremely RUDE.  I had my order come wrong.  So I went to there door to talk to some one since a side door was open.   She only would say the lobby was closed and you need to go to the drive through. I said it was a long line and she just said go to drive through. Well it took 15 minutes the first time.  Now I need to wait longer because they messed up.  So I'll get home with cold food.   I don't recommend this location to any one.   Stinks that they don't know what customer service is these days.  I would have been more then happy to wait outside to get my order fixed."}
{"text":"Staff is not very friendly,  got our order wrong but replaced it with correct after arguing with me.  2 stars are for good food once received and clean play area.  Customer service very poor! : ("}
{"text":"BE VERY VERY CAREFUL!!!!!! Had I not been so cautious about my account activity I wouldn't have ever noticed. So I went to get my boyfriend some food one night and got him his usual. When the lady on the speaker told me my total was 10.87 I was kind of confused so I asked for my receipt. ALWAYS ASK BC THEY NEVER GIVE IT TO YOU ON DRIVE THROUGH!!!!! when i got my reciept the total was 9$ and some change. So when I went home I checked his account and he always gets the same thing his card had got charged 13.22$  I was with him when he went to this Burger King so I know for a fact he got the same thing which totals to 9$ so I got suspicious and checked my account and I had been charged for 11.34$  I don't know why they are doing this but this is two different times they have charged the wrong amount on TWO separate cards! They did not know we were together so they have been secretly taking more money! If you think about how many people go into drive through and don't check and they charge everyone a couple dollars extra! So disgusting! I talked to the manager and all she did was give me some change to makeup for what I was charged for with no real explanation. BE AWARE"}
{"text":"they made me a veggie burger at breakfast. count this weary traveling vegetarian very happy"}
{"text":"Pretty damn clean Burger King. This is a very snazzy lobby."}
{"text":"Up until recently, Burger King had probably the worst coffee in the world. After seeing TV ads for a \"New\" coffee that the fast food giant was offering, I decided to partake in all the hub bub. It also didn't hurt that for this promotional period, they would be offering 25c small coffees for a couple weeks (Note: at the time this review is being written, this deal has expired, so they are normal price). The new coffee was OK. It wasn't exceptionally strong as a DD, but it didn't taste like what you would get at a jiffy lube while you are waiting for your car to be serviced. It had an extremely mild flavor. I don't like this location because when you are trying to head out in either direction on Serene Ave, it feels like a death trap, with a steady stream of cars coming from both sides on this busy street."}
{"text":"Very happy with the drive thru person. I believe his name was Edgar . He was very nice and polite even though it was super busy at around 7 this morning. He cleaned my caramel frap off before he gave it to me and told me to have a great day as he gave me my straw."}
{"text":"Slow, slow and slow. Do i need to say more.This Burger King is the worst. I just waited inside 20 min for a Whopper meal. I get it sometimes shit happens but everytime it's something."}
{"text":"This is the SECOND time in TWO DAYS I've ordered my whopper with no tomato and instead get tomato with no onions. Very irritating seeing as though you people we not busy at 10:45pm on a Tuesday night. Clearly the facelift did absolutely NOTHING as far as customer service goes... BS!!"}
{"text":"WOW! So unprofessional! Super ghetto in this location and stupid!! Had to go in from the drive thru due to a flat coke and when i walked in they thought they were alone and the way they were talking and the language they were using was awful!! When i told them the problem they didn't do anything and the girl just vanished into the back she didn't tell me if she was going to fix it or not so i just left."}
{"text":"This location looks very nice with the new remodel. The employees are nice and provide good customer service. Food is prepared in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I was the only person at the drive thru and only 1 person eating in the store. I was told to pull around to the front door to wait for my food, I ordered a whopper Jr. With cheese and onion rings. I also asked for ketchup and mayo on the side. When I got home there was no ketchup or mayo and the burger had no cheese. I called and they said it was a new girl at the window, she took my name and number so that I could get another burger when I return. I have never been asked to pull around and frankly did not appreciate it. The bun was stale as well!"}
{"text":"We had a short window for breakfast before a mid-morning appointment. This place was on the way to our destination so we stopped for a bit. We were greeted and  order taken by the fabulous and lovely Sabrina. There was a slight wait but worth it for the piping hot food that followed. As we finished up Richard came around to collect our trays and offered us more coffee. That man is aces in my book! Pretty happy with our visit this morning and will visit again soon. Kudos to the SOD, Missy, for running a well oiled machine."}
{"text":"I do not want to waste my time on this place, so let's make this short.  They have serious sanitation problems in their kitchen, and the food is terribly bad. The place only offers food in the takeout bag after 9pm but you can still sit there and eat nevertheless. The tables are never clean, and the garbage cans are never emptied.  Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Bad service.. Couldnt get a simple order asking for mayonnaise and pickles only correct on a double cheeseburger."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of fast food, i RARELY eat fast food, but since i work nearby i started coming here one time i didn't have lunch from home. Let me just say that one particular lady who works here is the SOLE reason why i ever come back. this lady always greets me with a smile and is overall and agreeable person to interact with. i feel like a VIP when i come and its all because of the wonderful service she provides.   No one ever gives me annoyed looks when i bring coupons, (which i do a lot) as i have received at other locations. I am very pleased with this burger king, it has opened my eyes to the world of fast food. after all the makers of salad wraps cant be all wrong :)"}
{"text":"Drive thru: My order is almost always wrong. I get surprised when I actually get onion rings because most of the time I order them I get fries instead. Today I got onion rings but my sandwich was wrong. Half the times my mocha iced coffee isn't flavored. The plus side is of all the fast food places, this one tends to ask if I want sauce or ketchup when most places don't bother. It's still not every time. Once, the guy asked if I wanted any sauces. I looked him in the eye, said ketchup, and sure enough he didn't put any in the bag. I also have to repeat my order frequently and it's frustrating. When I ask for a medium combo  meal I sometimes get a small side. When I ask for a medium meal with a large drink it seems to blow their minds and the size gets wrong. \"Have it your way\" is so far from the truth. I only choose to come back here for the onion rings and iced coffee. Sigh."}
{"text":"I've not been here in awhile I'm only giving 5 stars because the cashier Chicago was super nice and super fast at filling my order. This kid needs a better job somewhere he's a hard working young man. Chicago"}
{"text":"this is by far the worst burger king i have ever been to. the first mistake was when i ordered the brownie icecream and the girl who made it gave it to me burnt. when asked did she know the brownies were burned she said yes and gave them to us to eat anyways. then when i go to the drive thru to make two seperate orders i was told only one order per vehicle allowed. i was like since when is this and why is that. the employees are so lazy and half assed they never do anything right. i would say if you are hungry and need a quick bite to eat do not come here what so ever. it should be closed down and they need to do a massive rehire."}
{"text":"The drive thru service was fine. Almost no wait. I had a coupon and they could see the coupons yet they made me start cutting it which held u the line. Other burger king as u for the coupon code which assures that u really have a coupon. Most of the time they ask u for the code through the speaker when u r doing the drive thru.  I guess every burger king has a different policy. Btw they put too much mayonnaise on their sandwiches.  30 cents extra per sandwich if u want cheese. Ask for less. Not fond of their fries. Good fries are at Arbys and Mcdonalds. Burger king might want to think about serving breakfast sandwiches all day like McDonalds. I came in for a Croissantwich but i was too late for breakfast because of a few minutes. Almost left because of that but didnt want the hassle of driving more."}
{"text":"Out of the 8 millions Burger Kings I've ever been to, this one is by far the worst . Every time I go through the drive thru, I have to be told to pull over to the other side of the building to wait for my food . I also show up to this Burger King assuming that my order will get messed up as well ."}
{"text":"I really don't have much to say besides....Do you even drug test? If not, may I suggest you start with the cackling Hispanic woman then work your way to your swing shift teens.   Worst service ever!"}
{"text":"When we first walked in, the line wasn't too long. We waited a few minutes to place our order; the lady at the cash register was bagging food items and forgot that we were standing there. Aside from that, she was quite friendly and helpful.   When we got our food, my daughter pointed out that there was a visible hair on our fries. Because we had already waited an unreasonable amount of time to receive our meal and a long line had grown, I refrained from notifying an employee. The food quality was mediocre. The fries could have been warmer and more fresh. While we were eating, we could hear the workers behind the counter yelling at each other and overall being very unprofessional.  There were several dirty tables in the dining room and I had to wipe off my table prior to eating.  Overall, it was a pretty negative experience and I will not go back."}
{"text":"Slow, slow and slow. If your going to charge me almost double the normal price at least it shouldn't also take double the time to order. The bun was falling apart which is classic sign of being frozen and the burger was cold"}
{"text":"Normally I don't go to Burger King for breakfast lunch or dinner but since corporate was paying I decided to stop by and get breakfast.   Nope sorry bad mistake never felt welcome, not one smile from any employee. I ordered a combo which is normally a large hash browns and a large drink but nope not what they call combo .  Even after the renovation to the outside and the inside the staff has not changed. I have already blown the whistle once at one Burger King in a Florida airport and this one but now I plan on not returning until after I see smiling faces and I feel welcome"}
{"text":"If you ever thought it was impossible to wait too long in the drive-thru, while you are the ONLY person there.....drop in on this hole in the wall.  It is possible!"}
{"text":"The building is very new and the staff is friendly. I go there at least 3 times a week because they are on my way home from work. The food has been consistent so far and the drunk machine is a awesome custom mixing coke machine that let's you customize every drink. The wait times can be long at times so a faster drive thru would be nice but, I'd say overall it's one of the top burger kings I've visited for fast food."}
{"text":"Rude girl that took my order  - it's her job - so try to be nice with people - or stay home - it's my $$ who pay ur salary"}
{"text":"They only thing that is horrible here is the attitude for the employees. My first time coming to this location we went through the the drive through and with no one else there but me, the employee that I talked to sounded like she was in a hurry. Very rude and sarcastic!"}
{"text":"Went there at lunch time and couldn't get service. Waited 4 minutes with no one in front of me. There was one clerk and she was manning the drive thru and the incoming traffic.  Not blaming the clerk she was very busy , putting the blame on the manager and perhaps the district manager. The manager for poor scheduling, the district manager for cutbacks on employees.  That was my perception.  Obviously customer service is out the window at this establishment."}
{"text":"Too bad I can't give this place zero stars because it's a totally worthless restaurant. They never get my order right. They act like they are doing you a favor by taking your order.   The management here is apparently AWOL. The sooner this place permanently the better."}
{"text":"Stopped in for something sweet after running errands with the GF.  There are plenty of other places to cure a sweet tooth and as fate would have it we ended up here.  Rolled into the drive thru, which is split allowing for two separate lines to make orders.  Several vehicles were ahead of us but the line moved quickly.  The process from order to pick-up was quick and smooth.  The vanilla shake we ordered and shared was the topic of conversation until it was gone.  The experience was A-OK but the shake (small) was another matter.  It was 550 calories, 10 grams of Protein, 91 carbs. 81! grams of sugar, 16 grams of fat, 310 milligrams of Sodium, vanilla soft serve and vanilla sauce (what the hell is that?) of \"what the F&%$! are we doing\"  experienced betterness."}
{"text":"While heading down St. Rose en route to a location in Southern HIghlands for the boys FB game, we made a quick stop to fill him with some calories.    I found the drive thru to be quick and friendly and without worry.   With that said, this particular BK is as BK does."}
{"text":"So this is a Burger King and I don't have high expectations. I come here often since it is by my work and they have some good deals. The staff is always friendly and if they get my order wrong it's fixed.   My complaints would be that their soda machine is out of my drink a quarter of the time I go, and same with their ketchup machine.   Their 3.50 cheeseburger value meal is worth the price to have to ask for packets or ketchup and soda from their machine behind the counter."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place zero stars. I came here about 2 weeks ago, both hubby and I were starving so we stopped in to buy some food, we tried the first door, locked, someone standing around outside told us there is another door, okay great, we went in and was told by people in front of us that the place is closed due to no staff, now this was at 7pm, seriously, closed. Very upset and disappointed we left and made something at home. So today we tried it again, well because why not. So much to our amazement they were open so we ordered our food but when it came to ordering my drink, a coffee, I was told that they do not have hot coffee and that I must drink the cold stuff, now I hate cold coffee, it's disgusting, tell me they only serve coffee in the morning and who would want a coffee in this heat anyway and at 7pm. Never in my life was I refused coffee in Africa nor in Europe at any time of day and night. Im a paying customer I didn't ask them to do the impossible, I merely wanted a nice cup of hot coffee. I was even asked if I am a student and why do I need to drink coffee at this time as if it was any of their darn business what I do and why."}
{"text":"This Burger King is good! The service is fast. Their pop doesn't taste good though. Especially their Dr Pepper, it just tastes weird. I love the fact that the staff is so friendly! They are always so polite and cheery."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but bad experiences the 3 times I came here in the past month. 2 times I went through the drive thru i sat there for at least 5-8 minutes waiting for someone to greet me and take my order (or at least say hello and they will be with me in a couple minutes) -no one did! So I proceeded to the window... Again- no one came to the window for an additional 5 minutes I waited there so I left. The ONE time I did receive my food the fries were old, cold, and soggy. Less than impressed! I'm aware it's a chain fast food place and not to expect greatness but cmon.... Some plain old common sense customer service would be nice."}
{"text":"This is the Burger King I grew up with. My parents literally live around the corner, and this has always been one of my favorite locations. Something has seriously changed recently. Earlier this week my mom took my son for a kids meal and was told they no longer offer toys in their kids meals, they were offering cookies instead. I brought my son back to this location today and was told they have also discontinued the cookies. Try explaining that to a 3 year old. Also, we had to go back to the counter 3 times for missing or incorrect items in our order, and the employees were very cold and unfriendly. It is like night and day from a month ago. Hopefully they correct this soon"}
{"text":"I love this burger king location it's not far from my house and the quality of food is sort of hit or miss but it's still good for what it is and the customer service is pretty good each time I come here."}
{"text":"the burgers are honestly on par with any and every other burger king i've eaten at. what i don't like specifically about this location that makes me give them 1 star is on 3 separate occasions in the past i was served re-fried fries. 1 of the times i saw them actually rescoop  my fries up from where they sit to get packaged and thrown back into the fryer so they would be warm... anyone that has had re-fried fries before knows exactly how they look and taste. disgusting and unacceptable.  Edit : these experiences i had were before they actually revamped and updated this location. i do not know if they still do practice this since then, nor do i plan to ever find out."}
{"text":"First few visits here and no probs. but last time I went which was about 2 months ago the food was so disgusting we couldn't eat it.and it was pricey too! All of our food all had a weird, artificial, \"flame grilled\" taste to it like they changed their whole menu and recipes. Unfortunately it was NOT for the better! ! Will try a different location but not this one unless they change it back to normal !"}
{"text":"This is the worst Burger King I have ever been to. I have gave them several chances because I realize everyone has bad days.. BUT every time I'm in here the people working are rude and uncaring when they mess my food up... I will never be going back there!!"}
{"text":"We go here my husband and I and the employees are quick and always nice. They never get our order wrong and burgers are made correctly. We get different cashier at the window and they are all good and professional. As far as the location, yes there are homeless but so what? Theyre not the one making your burgers!"}
{"text":"I changed my order and the girl got an attitude. I had to delete items off my order and she got another attitude.  I won't return here ever again. Might I add she was nice to everyone else. It took all I had not to cuss her out."}
{"text":"No one that works there cares about food, service, or cleanliness.  It's a pig bucket of BK.  Good luck if you get the scraps."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. The slowest of any drive thru.  Employees don't care and you see them sitting outside the back door smoking while the line never moves. Voting with my dollar and will never return even though I work very near there."}
{"text":"If I could, I would rate this Burger King a 0! Every single time I come to this specific burger king, either the drive thru takes forever (1-2 cars), messed up orders, & no service. We once had to wait 30 min at the drive thru, but couldn't leave because there was a car behind us. We drove off due to how pissed we were. This burger king needs new management ASAP."}
{"text":"What can I say it was burger king. This place was nicer than most other locations and everything was correct!"}
{"text":"The food here reminds me of the character Meh form the Emoji movie. Every time I eat here the food is Meh. I would not recommend it, the customers here are also rude. Finally, the bathrooms don't smell good."}
{"text":"3/15/18 at 8pm. Pulled up to drive thru window and ordered 4 plain double cheese burgers with mayo on side.  She got confused so i repeated then she repeated plain to me but didn't ring it as plain and without knowing that was my whole order she is telling me the total and rushing me to the window.  At which point i was pretty sure they were going to be made wrong so at window i repeated they are plain right?  She gave me the dirtiest look and said i didn't say plain.  I hope they record everything cause im just completely astounded.  I would have left right then but she already took and swiped my card so i couldn't just say forget it.  She said she'd remake them but at this point with the rude behavior and nasty attitude im not sure id even want to feed them to my dog."}
{"text":"I really like Burger King. This one is just ridiculously horrible. Yes it's fast food and they make mistakes but I have been here many times and there has been an issue every time. One time they didnt have the item that was clearly on the menu, another time the order was completely wrong, this last time I went the food was cold. Both the fries and onion rings were beyond old. I wish there was another Burger King near by because this one is a fail."}
{"text":"Worst Burger King I have ever been to! I went to get lunch for my coworkers and I. The lady talking my food order barely spoke English which was fine but she was the manager! I couldn't understand a thing she was saying and she was rude the whole time. I had to wait for my food for 10 minutes and I noticed she didn't charge me enough so I told her and it turns out that she charged my card twice for two different things without telling me. She started to speak in Spanish in front of me and rolled her eyes to her employees about me. That was so uncalled for and beyond rude. I do not recommend for anyone to go here. I will not be going again. They don't even deserve a star."}
{"text":"I stop at a Burger King maybe once or twice a year. I like their original chicken sandwich. Stopped at this Burger King for one and what a disappointment. It cost over $5 just for the sandwich. I ordered a small onion ring and my total came to over $8. No drink. Just a sandwich and onion rings. Then, I had to put mayo on it when I got home. Not to mention, the lettuce was almost nonexistent.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for something cheap and quick being half desperate. Ordered a bacon burger from the dollar menu. Yes, you get what you pay for, but this wasn't bad for the price. Too bad they ruined it with too much mustard!"}
{"text":"Standard BK.  But be prepaired it is located in the main bus terminal."}
{"text":"I got some chicken they were all burnt asf and a while back we came there was no one just me and 1 other person took them 30 min to take a simple order out."}
{"text":"What the heck this Burger King location got rid of the sauge and cheese sandwich now we are stuck getting burritos I wish they would put it back on the menu."}
{"text":"Had a craving for BK so stopped in for lunch this past weekend. The staff were friendly, attentive, and our food order was ready quickly, and was fresh and hot. The restaurant seemed pretty clean and tidy, although business was definitely slow (maybe 10 others there in total?) The washrooms are locked and a staff member needs to enter a code to let you use it. That's not too surprising considering the location.  There's not much else to say. It's Burger King. :)"}
{"text":"The general manager Ana took my drive thru order and was very rude. When I came to the window she rolled her eyes when I asked for a Ranch. She also then threw the ranch into the bag with horrible body language. She just didn't offer good customer service and wasn't nice. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service at the drive-thru, the screen that tells you what you've ordered was not working and the lady takeing our order had a horrible attitude and was trying to rush us even though we were the only car in line. Then they still managed to get our order wrong. My family and I wont be comeing back to this location."}
{"text":"Went this morning.  Ordered 2 bacon, egg, cheese biscuits.  Rec'd 2 bacon, egg, cheese croissants.  Wasn't an accident.  Items were marked correctly.  Tasted terrible.  Never again.  Now I know why McDonald's is #1 for breakfast items."}
{"text":"I wish I could do 0 stars. worst service ever. waited in a 5 car lane for food, that took 25 minutes to actually get. and everyone was rude and crabby.  I will not come back.  They need to teach their staff some manners. ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Fan comme je suis des burgers et surtout depuis le temps que j'entendais parler de cette enseigne je n'avais qu'une hâte c'était de la tester... Et bien franchement soit les gens aiment manger des trucs moyen soit je n'ai vraiment pas eu de chance car je ne comprends vraiment pas pourquoi tout le monde adore à ce point Burger king.   La décoration est sympa plutôt simple mais quand même sympa. J'ai choisi le menu trio exceptionnel qui comprend un Burger, une boisson et frite avec Poutine. Alors ok je ne suis pas une grande connaisseuse de Poutine mais celle ci n'était vraiment pas terrible. Ensuite la boisson, j'ai pris un ice tea et (même si je ne sais pas si ça existe en vrai) j'avais l'impression de boire quelque chose qui avait le goût d'un coca mais sans les bulles (oui oui) du coup je ne les pas finit. Puis le Burger (soi-disant exceptionnel): 1 steak avec du cheddar, plein de cornichon, un surplus de tomate et une impressionnante quantité d'oignon! Seul la sauce était bonne. Et tout ça pour 10 dollars svp. Très élevé pour une moitié de Burger avalée avec 3 frites  et accompagné de 2 gorgés d'une boisson vraiment bizarre.   Et là arrive le passage le plus marrant de cet avis. La serveuse était une américaine venu au Québec pour apprendre le français mais elle ne voulait pas le parler avec moi car c'est une langue trop dur à apprendre et qu'elle préfère l'anglais. Au moins elle m'aura permise de perfectionner mon anglais pendant les 30 secondes de commande!!!   Bref Burger king testé et franchement pas convaincue..."}
{"text":"The drive thru is suppose to be open until 12am and I got there at 11:40 today, they were all closing up the guys wouldn't even talk to me. So I basically made the whole trip over there for nothing."}
{"text":"It's not often that I eat at Burger King. Eating fast food in my house is not unlike a military operation. We all gather around, plan out our meals to the small detail, and execute our mission with Navy Seal like precision.  Burger king is not the first place I'd like to eat though. There are numerous other fast food places in the area that provide a much better dining experience. It takes several minutes to get the food. Compare to McDonalds, that is quite a long time. Once you get the meal, it usually looks nothing like what you see on the menu. I suppose this is true with all fast food joints, but more-so with Burger King.   The food is slightly over priced. For a burger meal which would cost around $5.00 at McDonalds, costs nearly $7.00 at burger king. Sure there are some cheaper options, but they are usually puny burgers with very little meat. If you decide to eat at Burger King for your next fast food outing, I'd greatly recommend the BK Double Stacker and a Hershey's Sundae pie. It's actually quite good. The french fries have a sea-foody taste to them. They are good, but they taste like fish which is a little bizarre. One thing I love about the fries is how thick they are compared to other Fast Food joints. They really put a lot into these fries.   With all of the good fast food/dine-in choices in the area, Burger King wouldn't be my first choice for dinner."}
{"text":"It was so flipping cold here, I barely had time to enjoy my whopper or say anything good about the experience!"}
{"text":"I have wandered in here a couple times while waiting in line at the DMV across the street. It's a pretty standard Burger King - nothing exciting, but it'll feed ya in a pinch. The floors are clean, the tables are less so, and the bathrooms are disgusting. But hey, you get what you pay for.  Beware, this place gets crazy at lunch time. Between 12 and 2 you can expect a 15 minute line."}
{"text":"Despite being attached to the grungy Charlotte Transportation Center, they've done a decent job with this place. I'm guessing that they've stepped it up a little because they are across the street from the Time Warner Cable Arena - they'd do a good trade on game nights. The floors were mopped, the tables numerous and clean, the staff friendly, the service quick and polite.  But at the end of the day, it's still a Burger King."}
{"text":"I haven't been  to a Burger King in years because they appeared dirty to me. Today i decided to give it a try again. Their hot dogs looked good so i stopped. I waited at the counter for a few minutes with a view of the prep area. The guy working at the prep area pushed the garbage can with his gloved hand hanging onto it. Then he swept the counter with the same gloved hand and proceeded to make someones food. Absolutely disgusting.  Not sure what parts of the health card videos he missed...i told the manager what the guy did, he seemed either uninterested or didn't understand what I was saying. Guess i can cross them iff my fast food list."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab lunch if you're rushing. The poutine & sundae pie are pretty good. There's a fun playground/climbing structure for kids."}
{"text":"Do not go in for lunch unless of course you want to listen to everyone in the back complain and argue about working and fellow employees,  this is not the first time this has happened like come on' also the fries are always old i usually have to tell them fresh fries not like burger king fries are good anyway lol..."}
{"text":"This is the worst Burger King I've ever been to the drive-through was closed and they don't take the app coupons very rude customer service never go there again hope this helps someone"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite late night places to get a quick meal.  However twice this week I have been disappointed and all I wanted was 2 chili dogs and on both occasions was told they don't have them.  I won't go into further detail, but I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  The guy that took my order disregarded what I said and put what ever he wanted.  Stopped at the first window and she couldn't comprehend what I wanted and it was a simple chicken sandwich, just the sandwich.  Left to go inside so I could speak to someone that spoke English.  It's ridiculous to have to do this and need to find someone that doesn't have a language barrier."}
{"text":"This BK is HORRIBLE! Service is VERY slow and staff LESS than friendly.  Food is always cold and tastes like it has sat under a warmer for a very long time."}
{"text":"This location in particular always skimps me on at least 1 item every time I go through the drive thru. The past few times I've been there I've had to go back and get the last item that they \"forgot\" to give me. The food is very well made though!"}
{"text":"Well typically on my way home we would go to bk just grab something simple and quick we haven given this location 5-6times and each time we come out disappointed. Either the service is crappy or the store isnt clean. and tonight was no different. We walk in there I was soda spelt on the floor with just a sign on top of it, most drink options were out. We go to order our food and the girl was just rude, I know it's there job to make sure they get everything but she seen that there was two of us that needed to order once my bf got done ordering she cuts me off. I also one that that annoyed me is that they were playing inappropriate music in the back I think should not be played. Also it always takes us at least 20-25 min to get our food when there isn't anyone in line at the drive-Thru as well inside... I don't think we will be going to this one anymore If I could give no stars I would"}
{"text":"I get it's an airport burger king but seriously, 1 sauce for 9 chicken fries? Buggin'. Also, they play favorites. Airport workers receive their food faster than others"}
{"text":"Really bad customer service! They should hire people that are people friendly. The African American lady that took our order was not very approachable and didn't even say thank you or have a great day. The place have a very negative vibe and I was not comfortable eating there because it was dirty!"}
{"text":"Only been here for breakfast, I feel drive thru it's much faster than the mcdonalds across the street."}
{"text":"So this location is pretty new. Overall, Id say its one of the better ones. They seem friendly, food is, we'll typical, and service can be all over the board.  We've had long waits and fast service. Mostly its O.K. but a few times, way too long, and usually its because your food has been prepared, but it waits under the heat lamps for someone to grab it and give it to you."}
{"text":"Horrible.  That's really the only word that comes to mind when I think of the Burger King in Oregon.  I'm not a big breakfast person so I was ecstatic when they started serving burgers during breakfast.  But half the time when I go, the grill is \"broken\" but miraculously it's always fixed by lunch time.  Also their Mountain Dew has a root beer after taste.  And expect to wait no matter what or when you order.  Not sure how they can call themselves fast food.  I can't say I would be at all disappointed if this place closed down."}
{"text":"It's Burger King.... This location is usually clean and the staff is usually pretty nice.  I was going to give them 3 stars but their bathroom is always real clean."}
{"text":"Absolutely filthy. Sticky from the ceilings to the floor. Long wait. Would have left if I were alone."}
{"text":"It's fast food, I get it's not the top quality of the food chain. But this is just poor quality all around. I don't normally eat Burger King and honestly won't be back again. I ordered the new crispy chicken sandwich and what I got seemed to be a slightly oversized nugget hidden between some soggy lettuce and honestly a pretty fresh tomato. The chicken was so gross, must have been sitting in oil for a while, very dark brown and tasted like peanut oil. My lady ordered the chicken nuggets and now we know why they are so cheap. They were colder than room temperature, and had to be heated up once we got home. Overall I'll never be back to Burger King and if you are reading this I highly recommend you not frequent this location."}
{"text":"I stopped by to get my toddler lunch on 4/23/18 and he got sick from the chicken nuggets. He had food poisoning for 2 days, he was unable to eat or drink anything. I called the er to confirm whether or not to take him in, and I was advised to take him in due to dehydration from the vomiting and he was lethargic. I won't be returning to Burger King."}
{"text":"Are we SURE the map is correct on this Burger King? The pin on the map drops in the parking lot of the Ballantyne Hotel. I drove around for 20 minutes looking for this place. Am I missing something?"}
{"text":"On October 9, 2017 at 1:45pm I went to this Burger King drive thru and ordered a Whopper meal. Usually they ask what size and if I want cheese at the intercom, but this time they didn't. At the 1st window I upgraded to medium fries/drink and added cheese. At the 2nd window, they gave me small fries/drink and no cheese, even though I paid extra for it. The manager in the background looked at me like I was crazy when I said I changed it to medium at the first window. They gave me the order and closed the window so fast that I didn't even get the chance to ask them to add the cheese. They also didn't even give me a receipt. Very sloppy. It wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of BK since I was a kid, so every time I go there, I have a feeling of nostalgia. Guess we should have looked at the reviews before stopping at this BK location. A great friend of mine in the restaurant business once told me that if their parking lot is dirty, then inside of their kitchen probably is, too. Well, this parking lot was dirty with trash everywhere and the garbage cans were all over filled at 12pm. I went against my better judgement since I just wanted something quick and good, and ordered there anyhow. The service was good enough and their food was hot and fresh, and I got a lot of napkins, but no receipt. I was a satisfied customer, but I truly wonder how clean and safe it is in there. I didn't get sick, so hey I'm happy."}
{"text":"I've recently become a fan of the 5 for $4 meal at BK and had heard some good things about BK's hot dogs so i decided to try one out. i gotta say, not good. sparse toppings. overcooked dog. just not good. won't order again - at least not here."}
{"text":"Nighttime manger on 9/19/17 attempted to steal my money in my opinion.  I ordered one value fry and one 10 piece nugget which should have been approximately $3.  Was given two value fries and a 10 piece nugget and charged $7.27 on my debit card and OBVIOUSLY not given a receipt in the drive through.  Went inside and spoke to manager who immediately knew why I had returned and got defensive with me when I was being polite.  I asked why I was overcharged and not given a receipt.  \"Manager\" then pulled out her phone and calculated what I should have been charged and refunded the difference but didn't get the money from register and somehow knew exactly what my debit card was charged.....SUPeR sketchy and obviously trying to steal $3 from me without me noticing and may have not even made an official transaction because I was never given a receipt in the drive though or after my \"refund\".  Would never normally go back in but I felt a scam and everything about my interaction confirmed this.....hope I'm wrong but I will not be going anywhere near this location ever again."}
{"text":"I'm done being disappointed by Burger King. From cold breakfasts, to incomplete orders, i've had it and I won't be back. I loved their satis-fries, but sadly those are gone, and with them any reason for me to visit Burger King again. Save yourself the pain and go across the street to Wendy's because this Burger King the food is usually cold, and often incorrect."}
{"text":"Used to frequent this place often. Not anymore. This place has the rudest staff I have ever seen. I have never walked out of a place so angry before. Do yourself a favor and go across the street to taco bell or arbys. You will see the difference."}
{"text":"The local mega wholesale retailer in the area went to Pepsi products....DAMN! I miss the their Coke.  It seemed the perfect combination of syrup and carbonation.  After shopping, I was craving a soda pop.  The GF and I stopped in to the BK to get one.  There was approximately three cars ahead of us, which one would think was not a big deal but at this particular location on a Monday, one might want to think again.  It was somewhere in the 8 to 10 minute range before we made it to the window.  While at the window I was told my one large Coke was $16!  The clerk at the window when I told him said nothing and turned around to get the manager.  The manager was nice enough and comped the Coke.  Serves me right....I probably should not be drinking ti anyways."}
{"text":"filthy place ...manager didn't care when brought to his attentions ...LOUSY SERVICE AVOID this place"}
{"text":"I love this BK! I don't eat too much fast food but when I do I look for BK.   This BK is great.  The manager or supervisor there is always friendly.  All the staff always serve with a smile on their faces.   It's also open early enough that I can get my post workout chicken nuggets!"}
{"text":"It's a Burger King. Nothing more or less. They were fast, the staff was friendly and the place was clean. All good for a quick burger!"}
{"text":"I tried to get a replacement for my crispy chicken sandwich and was told they couldn't because I was told I ate half when I only took a bite out of my sandwich and the chicken was rubbery and wouldn't even tear. So I took it up to the weekend manager whom wouldn't give me his name and was told that I ate half and he wouldn't replace it I begged for him to check the surveillance and he refused to he kept calling me a liar and that I had to have eaten half of the chicken so my autistic son snapped and asked him just to replace the fucking chicken sandwich and he told him he wouldn't because he cursed at him even when the cook had been asking him just to replace it he told her no it's the principle of the fact that she ate half so I called my husband at work he came down and the weekend manager said I was cursing at him I said no my son did after he kept accusing new of eating half the chicken I asked for a refund he also refused that 27.89 down the hole because we we made to leave I will never return to this Burger King and I will tell anyone I know to spread around how this manager and Burger King treats it's customers"}
{"text":"Not once have I been here and there had been more than 2 other customers around. Service is nothing extraordinary. Beware the panhandlers who hang out outside."}
{"text":"I was flying out of Charlotte and got to the airport really early for my flight so I opted for breakfast.  Being that Burger King is one of the only places open really early, I chose it.  Plus, I enjoy their breakfast items.    I know it's come to be commonplace to expect poor service at fast food restaurants, but...why?  I worked in fast food in my younger days and provided quality service.  I was quick, I was knowledgeable, I was friendly, and I was attentive.  Is that really too much to ask?  If you can't make it in fast food...where can you make it?    Anyway, I stood in line behind one other person to order my breakfast.  I stepped up to order when it was my turn, and after the co-worker next to him finished talking to him...or at least took a break.  I placed my order and then stepped down the line to await my order.  I looked around and saw chutes full of pre-made sandwiches sitting under the warming lamp.  Employees were congregated in the back talking.  And more employees were congregated around the register talking.  Nobody was working except for the cashier, and even he was doing a half-assed job.  The cashier abandoned his register and came over to fill the first guy's order.  He then proceeded to get my coffee and fill my order.  Some jerk-off airport employee behind me \"kindly\" offered to take the coffee I had just been poured so I could get a \"fresh\" cup.  Thankfully, the BK employee continued to give me my cup of coffee.    The food was good and still semi-warm, but is it too much to ask that people do their jobs while on duty?  Do you really need 10 BK employees standing around doing nothing?"}
{"text":"This place honestly doesn't seem like the one to care for reviews but I'll leave it anyway...What is this? I come here at 11:05, no biggie order a number triple Texas whopper. They take my order, wait 15 minutes (if you ask me for fast food drive through I think it's a little ridiculous, but whatever) I get to the window and she asks me if I ordered a whopper? A little confused I tell her \"Texas triple whopper\" to which she tells me \"oh we only have one meat\". Seriously? I mean it's totally fine, people run out of food. But they made me wait the 15 minutes to tell me they didn't have enough meat? That wasn't possible though the intercom? I would've said thanks and been on my way. Now that's not all, as I'm waiting for my food the girls inside are yelling at one another \"I'm a H**?! I'm a H**?!\" (It rhyme with toe) Highly disappointed. McDonalds next door probably would've done a faster and better job."}
{"text":"Wowwww...Cold breakfast, wrong order, no condiments, one person running the whole restaurant in the morning, and this has happened 3 times in 2 weeks...Here I come McDonald's!!!"}
{"text":"Went there on Mon, Nov 7th. Took 30 minutes to get my food, after 15 minutes of waiting I went to the counter to see what was going on. 3 people who ordered after me had already received food and I complained. The guy took my receipt and 10 minutes later brought me a tray that was sitting on the counter the entire time I was standing there. I asked for my receipt back and the guy said \"oh, I threw it away\". I asked to speak to the manager about my experience, the manager said, \"well, I don't know what you want me to do\". Again, I said this is unacceptable and he asked me, \"Do I like cheesecake\". Not that he would know, I am lactose intolerant and even if I wasn't, a piece of cake does not make up for the terrible experience that I had. The entire time after I complained, people behind the counter looked at me whispering and giving dirty looks. I'm sorry that as a customer I expect to be served, and if service is unsatisfactory, I expect to have someone make it right. Since I do not appear to be valued here, I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"First Burger King I've been to that has never messed up my order not even once. The employees are really nice and the bathrooms are always really clean."}
{"text":"Burger King should revoke this places franchise agreement or if it's a corporate store, they should be ashamed. Either way, the place should be condemned. Not sure why I tried to eat here, but management also closed a half hour early and didn't feel like working or serving their customers. Real nice!"}
{"text":"Not ashamed to admit that BK is an indulgent choice every now and again when I need something super quick. This location is a really, really rough look for the brand. You just get the feeling that the proprietor doesn't have a lot of pride in the outfit. More often than not, staff has a tough time taking orders efficiently or quickly, has a tough time getting the order right, and/or has a tough time keeping the drive-thru line moving. Passing by it on the way to and from my office, I've given it probably about half a dozen tries over the years before deciding that it just has to be the Mickie D's next door if I am in the area and in a pinch for quick, guilty pleasure lunch."}
{"text":"This BK is near my house and I get coupon booklets in the mail often. I wouldn't eat here as much if I didn't have the coupons. The burgers are fast food average and the veggies are usually fresh. The workers are nice but the wait time can be brutal often. I do like the cinnabon options they have I just don't like when they put in the box and bag upside down so that when I open it the frosting isn't everywhere but on the bun."}
{"text":"I appreciated that this Burger King was open long after all the other restaurants had closed. Other than that, it's a typical BK - but in an airport."}
{"text":"Video tells it all, employee stands on lettuce before serving on hamburgers and salad, you sign your own death warrant. See how many people eat at Burger King after that."}
{"text":"The do not take coupons they say its not cost-effective plus I saw bug on the floor"}
{"text":"Just parking is usually good but today they decide to have a meltdown and not have any registers open because they're broken. If you're broken you should go ahead use a pad paper and pen and take cash only this is why no one in fast-food deserves $15 an hour"}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times over the years ( is close to the inlaws house, quick stop for a snack). Good service, normal BK fare."}
{"text":"Time for an update. The past couple months, the food quality and service has much improved. Actually enjoy eating here again! Keep up the good work, ya'll!"}
{"text":"This guy is so rude at the drive thru. We sat at the window for 10 minutes (at least) with nothing. This is why I don't go to Burger King... because shit food with shit service."}
{"text":"Food tonight was excellent - fries and burger were by superbly fresh -- KEEP THIS MANAGER on staff. I haven't had a positive experience here in a while and today made me consider coming back again. 4 stars only because they did forget my extra zesty sauce for my onion rings."}
{"text":"The Rantoul Burger King is the worst at customer service! Last Wednesday, it took me 15 minutes to get a cup of coffee, and I was the only customer in line. It was 7:30 AM, and the staff had not even made coffee yet. To make matters worse, they couldn't  print out a receipt for me. Last visit here; made me late for work."}
{"text":"The worst place ever. I've gone 3 times at 9:30 and no one is ever there to take your order. They say they close at 11. This place is a joke. Stay away"}
{"text":"I go to Burger King quite often but this location is a poor reflection of the overall franchise. The food here is passable; not horrible since they have the same recipe as all other Burger Kings, but not particularly good either. The service though is seriously a problem.  Never have I ever seen staff as unsociable, rude, and unaccommodating as the ones here. It's a dingy restaurant with dim lighting and an old looking interior, so of course I didn't walk in expecting fine dining-level customer service. However, just from a short interaction at the cash register, the staff here (and not just one member but multiple staff members) clearly demonstrated to me how much they hated their lives and didn't give a single shit about their customers.  I asked about something, they said they didn't have it; no problem, I understand that things happen. But did they offer alternatives or even a meaningless \"sorry for the inconvenience\"? No. The staff here have a serious attitude problem; they don't just lack proper customer service skills, they lack basic manners. That of course is more than enough to convince me never to come back to this location again. There's a reason why this place was completely empty on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"When ordering through drive through I was never asked what drinks I wanted with my meals they just gave me Coke.  They are always out of certain breakfast items and you can never get what you want for breakfast.  And every time I order a ten piece chicken nugget they make me pull forward and wait 15 minutes because they never have any ready. They also have forgotten my dipping sauce practically everytime I go there.   The only reason I come back to this location is because it's by my house and the only one in the area."}
{"text":"I havent been to BK in years, so when i pulled up to the screen i was overwhelmed. The man at the window was so helpful and patient, i'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Je n'ai jamais compris l'attrait pour le Burger King, à chaque fois que j'y ai mangé, et cela partout dans le monde ce fut une expérience très déplaisante. Je ne vais pas décrire dans les détails la chose mais leurs burgers sont simplement immondes.  En plus de cela, le jour où j'ai mangé dans CE restaurant en particulier j'ai eu une intoxication alimentaire. J'ai passé plusieurs jours avec l'estomac complètement en vrac..."}
{"text":"The outside appear and the inside is extremely nice and well updated (it should be for a place that just recently was built and opened up it's doors). On my visit the AC was on way too cold for what was temperature wise outside.  The staff seem friendly but not extremely knowledgable when it comes to menu options and changing out items for another. Food seems to take a tad longer here than at other locations, but was at or slightly above others. Nothing was burnt or over cooked, my shake came out a tad too liquidity for my likes, but overall good quality."}
{"text":"Drove by, went inside.  Location quiet, clean.  Simple order as I ordered a combo.  Glad I chose to eat in, as burger was not made correctly (not a special order).    Brought deficiency to attention of staff and they promptly made me a new sandwich.    Reminds me of the Lethal Weapon movie where they (glover/gibsob/peshi) went throgh the drive trough, finding out after they left (J. Peshi) goes on f#%& rampage about going through drive through.  Glad I didn't or I would have had a similar feeling like peshi did, lol...  Food was good, as expected. Staff corrected issue right away.  4 stars due to mistake with order.  Everything else good"}
{"text":"Right now they cannot make any burgers at all only chicken burgers and I find that out from a customer not the employee I'm standing at the register for seven minutes and not one employee comes up to tell me I'll be with you in a minute sorry for the inconvenience or anything!! She looked at me three times and walked bye"}
{"text":"Not impressed with this BK at all. I usually go through the drive thru, but decided to eat in when I came by the other day. It's outdated and dirty. Homeless people hanging out outside asking for money. The egg in my croissantwhich was undercooked. They need to take care of their landscaping ASAP. The bushes in front of the drive thru speaker are overgrown and overrun with bees. Next time I'll make the drive down to BK on Charleston and Lamb as they have recently remodeled and improved on their service. Hope they work on this location soon because the staff is actually pretty nice."}
{"text":"Surprise!  They have rats.  As we live nearby, we called the manager - who was very standoffish.  He denied any responsibility, despite the fact they barely try to make it to the open dumpster with their garbage.  I wouldn't expect this location to be around for long."}
{"text":"No complaints on food!  The only reason it is getting 2 stars!  The PRICE is ridiculous!  $8.99 for a breakfast meal?  Seriously?  Rip off!!   Probably because we were at the airport & hungry with little choices!!  I will stick to TX Burger King's where they aren't out to ROB you!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. My bun was hard and the onion rings tasted like old grease. They forgot my husband's french fries and of course, we didn't realize it until we were down the road. Will not return."}
{"text":"I'm not really one to complain about the satisfaction of fast food, but the quality of the burger King I had today in the charlotte airport was disgusting. My bread was hard and stale, my patty was cold, and my fries were under cooked. Also the woman who took my order could not have been any ruder. She sat and talked to a coworker about personal things for a few minutes with me just standing at the register. That displeased me more than the disappointing food. The only thing I can give credit to is the young man who was handing the actual food out. He was as nice as he could be and wishing everyone a great day."}
{"text":"The only reason I checked in was because of the strangest burger king bathroom I've ever been in and I had to leave a tip. Huge, meandering corners and just one sit down toilet.  But then I had my experience with the employees and decided to go ahead and complete a review.  The food wasn't horrible, its a Whopper, not a bad burger, compared to most.  Well, now that they found horse meat in Whoppers in the UK, I might change that thought.  But anyhow, I was on I-85 coming into Charlotte and was somewhat in a hurry, so I pulled of the exit when I saw the food sign.  Once getting off said exit, I realized it was a couple miles off the exit, but by that time my stomach had made a decision that my brain couldn't argue with.  I finally make it by there and have to pee badly.  I walked into this seemingly normal looking Burger King bathroom only to be THOROUGHLY surprised.  You walk in and its NICE, but then you notice there are no urinals.  You take a couple steps in only to see a solitary commode on the right with no doors and man looking very vulnerable with his pants to his ankles.  It looks like there might be more bathrooms around the corner, so you pretty much have to walk up to said man trying to do his dooty just to find its just a meandering wall.  Its almost like they had room for many more toilets but never got a permit to put them in.  Very strange and quite awkward.  That was going to make this a 3 star review, but then I ordered food.  The lines were long inside and I REALLY didn't want to stand behind this man after taking all of his dignity so, I went to my car to make a drive-thru run(remember also, I was in a hurry).  The lady in front of me took a while to order, I started to get a little anxious.  When it came time for me to order, I said clearly, \"Whopper combo, no cheese, no onions, small fries, and a small Dr. Pepper\".  I was prompted to go to the first window.  I sat there a few minutes until someone finally came, there was no one in the drive-thru line besides me at this point.  I get up the main window where a relatively young employee asks me loudly \"You get a Whopper junior\"?  I said no, a whopper combo.  She promptly yells at here manager and said \"See, I tolds you!\"  and they start bickering.  I finally just asked for my food which was in her other hand and she hands it too me, but I still have no drink, and normally they give you the drink first.  I know this because a lot of times they will give you the drink first, but then wait to give you a straw in the bad(annoys the hell out of me, sorry for the off topic rant, LOL).  So, then I finally say, could I please have my drink and pointed to what was obviously mine and the girl gives me and evil eye and says \"Damn mister, hold your _________-in horses, I'm fittin to get it\"  I gave her a little mean eye back and then she started to say something to me again but got real quiet when the manager walked up.  I was in a hurry so I drove off and let this girl keep her job.  But, don't ever yell at me for you not doing your job when you work in the service industry.  The food was pretty average BTW."}
{"text":"Visited today because I waited too long in the day to eat. I ordered all my items from the dollar menu. Food was hot, freshly made and the zesty sauce is great. I am glad I stopped!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Terrible. Try another Burger King. I took my grandson in to try the new all beef grilled hotdog. They look juicy and tasty in those commercials. I love hot dogs so I figured maybe I have a new place to eat hotdogs. NOT. My hot dog was sliced down the middle (I hate that), dry and not tasty. Probably all beef but who knows. Maybe left over from the day before or frozen? I am not sure. Why would they slice it down the middle unlike the commercial which shows them grilling in the round. Completely dries out a hot dog in my opinion.  I sent an e-mail on the corporate web site and never received a reply. Bad customer service to I guess. So I turn to Yelp to let others know.   My grandson is ten and could be part of their future customer base. They didn't help that statistic much. They spend tons on these commercials and then drop the ball."}
{"text":"This place has horrible service. I never get my food fresh, and whenever I try to order a shake or slushee the machine is either broken or they ran out of it. I always have to repeat myself whenever I order, even when I'm inside speaking directly to the cashier! I do not like this place at all."}
{"text":"I pass by this Burger King all the time, but it's usually during a time when I don't have the time to stop in and eat food. It's also in a location that kind of sucks to get to if you're coming in from the other direction.  I stopped in one morning for breakfast. While there were plenty of cars in the parking lot, there was no one in line. I was greeted by someone behind the counter and she took my order quickly. My food also arrived to me just as quickly, I decided to take my breakfast to go, and it was delicious when I arrived at my location."}
{"text":"This Burger King is slow. They make you pull around and park for your order. Every time I come here."}
{"text":"This is slow fast food, at least at night. Food was good but they were having everyone pull around to the front parking lot and wait for their food.  Love chicken fries."}
{"text":"They always get our orders wrong in the mornings...at a time when most people are too busy to go back to address any issues.    You don't know until you are down the street that they gave you a caramel coffee, not mocha.  And/or they forgot to give you your hashbrowns after charging you a crazy high price."}
{"text":"Just wanted to get a quick bite to eat. Although there speed was efficient the food was sub par. My order was correct but my food was like warm. The prices of the food was fair. Unfortunately this burger king does not offer all the products that others do."}
{"text":"20 minutes in the drive thru for a double bacon cheese burger, fries & shake! And the burger had no bacon!!!! Are you kidding me??!!!! Somebody needs to get this place together."}
{"text":"This is the worst BK ever!!!! Corporate needs to come in re-staff & re-train. Cashiers is not so smart & burgers were cold."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd being doing a Yelp review for Burger King.....it's just a fast food joint. This particular locations food isn't any better then any other BK. Except for the fries, WAY better then the other BK's I've been to. The customer service today is the reason for the review. Brandon was very nice & accommodating when we arrived & MJ was totally enthusiastic to be at work on this very rainy day and he was super sweet. Kudos to the management team & the crew, the great customer service had me walking out with a smile!"}
{"text":"I go here when I'm too lazy to drive somewhere (I work very close to this location). The food is ok although never seems to be hot enough and usually on the cold side. Not a fan of the fries (prefer Wendy's or NY Fries)  The angry whopper is one of the best if only the food was hotter."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this Burger King the service is getting worst. This time Rude employees. #Terrible"}
{"text":"Whopper was fresh and BIG like I remembered when my mom use to take me there when I a kid. Fresh lettuce, tomato and onions. And lots of mayo just how I like it! Fries were hot also! The burger is now wrapped in a thicker stock paper giving it a better quality burger feel. Good job BK! Used their app to get a deal on the spot!"}
{"text":"This was  the best restaurant .  I like it because they have the good taste of the chicken fingers and when you dip it and catch up it's super delicious ."}
{"text":"They were over staffed but took them more than 5 minutes for the drive thru to move. Also she rushed me with my order but still got it wrong, once I told her about it she used foul language and tried to say I didn't mention it but while waiting I noticed multiple employees going in  and out a little blue room which looked like maintenance or office,eating food and using their phones. I do not plan on returning to Burger King!"}
{"text":"Sitting here for more than 5 mins already at the drive thru window. No apology for waiting and when the guy gives me my food, he doesn't say a single word to me.   I'm watching the guy wait for my order to come up, mind you, he sees me looking, drops a bag on the ground, picks it up and uses if like it never laid on the floor.... This must be a prank.... Am I on punk'd?"}
{"text":"I ordered the 10pcs nuggets off the frier coz what i wanted was fresh batch of nuggets... And what i got was refried nuggets!!! Wtf was that?!!!! Then i tried calling the stores back to let them know that it did not taste well and surprise surprise their phone was busy!!! Called for about 15 mins again to see if i can speak to a manager but its still busy!!! Their number was always busy signal when i tried to call for another 20 times within 20 mins but its still busy signal!!! Good thing that the nuggets was only $1.49 for 10pcs... I just threw it away coz even our dogs wouldn't even eat it!!! Thats how bad the taste was!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Burger King today 07/20/15 at approx: 11:40am. The reason I am giving this review a 1 star is because of a few things today. 1: The drive through speaker was broken so you had to drive up to the window to order food. 2: Because of this I had to wait about 10 minutes to just get to the window to order (only 2 cars in front of me) 3: I wanted a large combo and she said they only could do a medium (huh?!) she did not give me any reasons why (out of large cups? running out of fries??) and 4: I noticed they did not give me a receipt for today knowing that people were probably going to report to corporate the several things that were wrong today. The lady at the drive up was nice but that wasn't the issue.   I am glad they remodeled this place but aside from that the wait times here are always very long and seems like the turn over here is high. I really hope they up their game soon. McDonald's is just a few hundred feet from them and their speed/service is 10x quicker than Burger King is."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 simple things at the drive thru, I paid and they asked me to wait in the front parking lot....well I waited 35 minutes and nothing came out....I gotta to go ask my money back and going to MCDONALD. ...not even a sorry....they just don't care anything about the customers....really the worst BK ever...."}
{"text":"Pretty clean avenue. The food and service were above par compared to other venues. Nice modern touch and they even have an all in one coke machine! Well deserved 4 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty great service. They made my fries fresh! Thanks you lovely burger kings and queens."}
{"text":"Absolutely the rudest help in this place!!! Almost everyone here seems to hate their job, except for one of the order takers. Believe me I hated I didn't have much choices for breakfast while I was traveling, but I wasn't rude to them about it."}
{"text":"Can't sleep.  Driving around at 4:00 AM.  Want a slush but Sonic is closed.  Free fry Friday.  Okay cool.    I pull into the drive thru.  There was only one car ahead of me so the wait was short.  The speaker was loud and I heard that the person in front of me spent a little over  $8.00.  Thrilling bit of info, I know. I ordered a single stacker and free fries.  The car in front of me left with their food in under a minute. At this point I have my radio cranked and I am crooning an old sad song. I pull up to the window, while still singing, and hand her my $1.08.  The very polite cashier started laughing, asked me if I was having a good time and offered me some ketchup. She handed me my order very quickly, it was piping hot and made correctly. Here is the problem...  THE FRIES WERE NASTY!  Yes they were hot and thick, kinda like a Wendy's fry, but they were waaayyyy over salted.  Yuck, I need a coke to get the taste out of my mouth but I didn't order one.  :(   I try my single stacker and that too was very salty. Four fries, two bites of the burger and I am done.  This is what I deserve for getting 4:00 AM fast food instead of keeping my ass in bed or throwing on a workout DVD.  I do not waste food so the remainder of this meal will be my dinner but yuck,  If I wanted a salt lick I would have licked the salt off of some pretzels.  Three stars.  Fast service, friendly employees and hot food at 4:00 AM"}
{"text":"I don't expect much when I pull into a Burger King, but at least change the oil before your fries taste like nuclear waste.  The last two stops I couldn't even eat them and I love fries!  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is not the best in town. The grilled chicken is rarely fresh and the bun not toasted. Better stick to the Whopper and hope for fresh. Like the coke machine, because I can get caffeine free diet cherry coke. Over-priced for fast food and the quality. Service is average."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zeros. This was the most disgusting burger I've ever had. There's a reason this shit hole company is going out of business. I literally threw up!! Avoid at ALL costs. Nasty!!!"}
{"text":"This service here has been very friendly. The manager at the time was this super friendly old man that kind of reminded me of Santa Claus.  On one particular occasion, one of the workers screwed up my combo and didn't give me fries. Like what the hell, right? Anyways I walk inside the store, and some scumbag just gives me the stink eye. Then out of nowhere, BOOM Santa Claus comes in and gives me a large for free.  If you're wavering on what fast food eat, come here just because of Santa Claus working here."}
{"text":"Visit this location WAY too often. Great, friendly staff. Nice play area for kids. Good food."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, they never seem to have enough people working or they don't want the business. The drive through took forever the guy in front of me waited a while before anyone even came on the PA. Why can't they just say \"Sir we are just a tad bit busy at the moment and we will be with your shortly, thank you\" I guess corporate America doesn't teach empathy that isn't scripted. Get your act together! Overworked and underpaid, how come Culver's and In & Out Burger deliver exceptional service with smiling faces but Burger King and industry veteran has lost it."}
{"text":"My favorite BK location.  Staff always goes above and beyond to take care of customers.  Food always fresh.  Restaurant spotlessly clean."}
{"text":"Very clean and new location! I was greeted when I waked in, which I have find to be very rare for fast food experiences!   I don't normally eat at Burger King but I had a coupon for $1 strawberry lemonade and wanted to give it a try!  The strawberry lemonade was good, it was a mix of the crushed ice strawberry syrup and lemonade blended together. They are made to order which was nice, my only complaint was that  it was a little watery but for a quick refreshing drink it definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"UPDATE to review below;   I went into this BK on 05/22/2014.  It had been completely remodeled for about 1-1/2 years now. There was a person standing at a cash register waiting to take orders. As with most all Fast Food joints, your order is taken and then you wait. Well the wait was standard, less than 4 minutes. It looks nice after the remodeling.    The restroom for the Men is a single use restroom. Meaning when you go in the restroom it is up to you to lock the door. The lock is similar to an airline restroom door. There is a message that shows up on the outside as , Occupied or Not.  This is not unusual. The restroom was nice as it was included in the remodel. It is an open concept and there is no stall around the toilet, but it is a single use facility so if you walk in on someone, it is they're neglect in not locking the door that is the reason you are forced to observe a person sitting on a toilet seat. Personally I prefer a private, single use restroom.  Therefore I have increased the stars to 4 from 2.    Like most fast food places the staffing seems to kept to a minimum and therefore floors and tables are not cleaned constantly.  This has become a standard in most fast food joints, even Wendy's which used to be pristine and years ago when McDonald's used to have the cleanest facilities, especially the restrooms, but no more.   It seems the management has improved the way orders are taken and the low class staff that used to be there.    The soda machine is a little daunting in the very large selection but if you have a problem figuring it out as I did, one of the staff came out and demonstrated it for me, kudos."}
{"text":"the most horrible dirtiest place ive ever took my daughter it eas so dorty i asked for my money back the kids playland was like dog kennal it was the dirtiest place ever i wouldn't let my dogs play there tje health department needs to step in here this is something i never seen before clean it up period jad to drive to chuck e cheese because my daughter wanted to cry thanks burger king"}
{"text":"I have a problem with this location. The other night the girl taking the drive thru orders was just NASTY! Not just with me either. The only reason I will give the location 3 stars is because they are usually not too terrible, and they always, well, almost always get my order right."}
{"text":"If you're leaving Vegas, know that this is the very last time you will have to shell out an ungodly amount of money for pure crap.   We just wanted a nice refreshing soda with ice and a straw to sooth our yucky tummies. Little did I know that two small sodas would cost $6.25.   $6.25!!!!!!!  What a gigantic rip off. Complete usuary. Eff you, BK."}
{"text":"EVERYTIME I come through the drive thru here they screw everything up. Food is cold. The burgers are disgusting. Onion rings are upside down in the bag, and there's barely any in there. The burger had too much mayo and nasty sawgy lettuce. The lettuce isn't fresh. The cheese isn't melted. Horrible customer service. Rude workers. They can't understand what you're saying. Avoid this place at all costs. Unless you're literally dying of hunger don't go here."}
{"text":"This is a small, average Burger King location in Scarborough which is located inside Agincourt mall and is normally not that full. I usually get my order without any issues. I did have trouble with the ketchup dispenser before but hopefully it's not a regular thing since they seem to have only one. The food is decent and I like their Whopper sandwich, although I would have liked the onions to be finely chopped. They keep their washrooms locked which seems like an inconvenient hassle having to ask an employee every time you need to use it.   There was also one incident last year involving an out of control customer (an old man) who was swearing and uttering threats against an employee, and he swore at a customer as well. There was no security or police called in but some protocol should be in place. Luckily he was ushered out by a lady that came in with him. They were still outside when I left and she was trying to calm him down, but things could have been worse.  I think that the interior is in need of a makeover (at all locations). My co-worker had described it as making him feel sad and depressed. I have to agree that the colors and the dull atmosphere makes me want to leave as fast as I can. Other competing restaurants have invested in redesigning their interior to keep up with the times and many even include TVs or free Wi-Fi, which makes them more customer friendly. This location doesn't have a self-serve soda dispenser/fountain drink machine either.   I had also noticed that I was being charged a few cents extra when using my credit card. They seemed to round up my transactions which should only apply to cash, so I expressed my concerns using their website. I was very impressed that they took the time to fix the problem and reply back:   \"Thanks for bringing your concern to my attention at Burger King in Scarborough. In the past every transaction was either rounded up or down with no intention of making money. At the end of day we notice we were up or down by less than fifty cents. Since you want us to fix the problem we have reprogrammed the POS system and in future if you are paying with credit or debit it will be exact to penny. Sorry for the inconvenience. Thanks.\"  This was handled very professionally which I appreciate very much."}
{"text":"We went for the two Whoppers for $6 meal. We added cheese and 2 orders of fries, and the total miraculously rose to $15.95. What a rip. No drinks even. This sucks."}
{"text":"If you want to know what it feels like to get kicked in the groin, by all means eat at this Burger King. A whopper and a small drink = 10.45! I know it's the airport but come on man. Also, the staff is a true collection of the best third world countries have to offer. Vague, rude and zombified. Watching the staff work was like watching an episode of the walking dead. I've never seen people move so slow. On top of everything, after I ordered my burger and drink, went to get ice and of course they were out of ice, picked my soda, it was flat, bit into my burger and spit the thing out. The thing was flooded with mayo.. So nasty..."}
{"text":"Food is still good. Line is fast. These are the rudest ppl though. Night and day from how it used to be. This locations saving grace is getting the spill overs from a packed Taco Bell line. These employees will make you want to wait in that line if it means avoiding them. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Never enough employees working especially in the morning. Food is good and customer service is standard. Just wish they had more people working there to speed up the process."}
{"text":"This was the worst service ever, waited over 20 for 2 burgers, the managers priority was the drive-through.  The manager didn't even apologize:("}
{"text":"The food wasn't that good and the fries were sort of lukewarm and a little old tasting (stale). They also messed up the order (as I almost always assume will happen at fast food chains). My bf asked specifically for no pickles on one of the cheeseburgers (for his mom) and instead they piled on 7 pieces of pickles - all of which were picked out.   But the service was so polite and sweet (probably that southern hospitality - I guess I'm still not used to it compared to the rude asses around the tristate area).   But I went in and saw my first coca-cola touchscreen 1-machine-with-every-possible-different-flavor-of-soda machine. I was so excited about it like a kid at Christmas (I love new technology!). I didn't get a drink with my food but my bf did and I was almost sad I didn't and the lady cashier noticed and offered me a free tiny cup to try the machine out. She made my day - and her manager even got mad at her for doing it (hope she didn't get fired!)."}
{"text":"I always go to burger king when I get off work from 11pm-1am. The worker James (black) is nothing but perfection! Food is always fresh and he provides nothing but five star service! Ive never experienxed this kind of customer service!"}
{"text":"Service was fast and professional, the floors were kind of sticky in some places. I was ordering food and saw the manager push the food in the trash down and without washing his hands, proceed to serve food. The tables & chairs were dirty, I asked an employee if they could wipe off a table so my father & I could eat, they of course said yes but didn't do so until 30 min later. We sat down and wiped the table ourselves and an employee saw us and ran over and apologized. The place has good staff but the standards were really low."}
{"text":"A Burger King is a Burger King, no more no less.   This location is off of Pineville Matthew rd near Carolina Place Mall and where I get my car serviced. Missing lunch at work the Friday of Memorial Day weekend, and just hanging out while getting my oil changed, I mosied on over here to grab some food.   There was a line, to be expected at lunch time. When I ordered my food I got a chicken nugget kids meal. I told the cashier I wanted fries and a soda because it says there's an option of fries or apple slices and soda or juice or milk. She said \"yes I know that's what you get with a meal\". Ok, I thought there were options, so I specified, is what I thought. What I said was \"ok\".   I waited for my food for a good 10 minutes while they were making new fries, not a big deal, because like I said, I would have just been sitting at the car place. When I got back to the mechanic and sat down my chicken nuggets were old. Sad but true, the best part of my meal, despite the fries being \"fresh\" was the half diet Coke, half Cherry Diet Coke, that I got to mix together because they have one of those really fun Freestyle Coke machines."}
{"text":"I go here every so often. I prefer BK over Mc Crap Don's. I went there today 15 min before close and my food was made, paid, and on my way all within about 4 min. Now my nugs and rings were pretty effing hot so I know they were fresh. I appreciate the effort in the accuracy and speed. I've had to wait longer during the lunch order when I was the only one in line. I know it sucks to have to cook until close then still have to clean. Sorry brother, but thanks for your hard work. You killed the drive through tonight."}
{"text":"I placed my order for breakfast and I asked what my options were for drinks they say coffee or soda so I asked for a soda and when they got done with the pricing my bill increased by $0.99 I was told there was no substitutions but when it was one of the options I don't think I was substituting the media TVs are in the off mode I have been here before and the TVs were on but maybe they're broke I'm unsure"}
{"text":"Nice kids some days and horrible creeps other days. Who hires here, the lotto?  Also, mustard is a Condiment. Its not part of the main course, nor is a burger supposed to have a huge glob in the middle which masks out every other flavor and makes my eyes bleed.   You can do better, should do better.Keep trying!"}
{"text":"Holy hell, don't eat at this BK.  It's dirty, crackheads swarm it, there are roaches.  Multiple people I know have gotten very sick from eating at this BK.  If you're craving Burger King, go else where."}
{"text":"Wow I'm very disappointed that this Burger King closed down for the evening at 9:00pm on a Friday night this evening.but what I'm frustrated about is that when I pulled into the parking lot around 8:45pm the Burger King employee locked the dining room doors all I wanted to see what the note said on the window needless to say I left the parking lot and went to McDonald's and purchase my meal there knowing they would still be open. If I could Burger King on stars I really would so I guess you get only one."}
{"text":"Burger king Review  195 Fletchers Creek Boulevard  Unfortunately the Standard of this restaurant is very poor. I am very disappointed to be writing this review. Where do I start from while coming into the restaurant waiting several minutes be severed. The management is just unbelievable they have no knowledge how to treat or talk to customers they have attitude and treat there customers very disrespectful not just simply providing the customer with what they have asked for not even listening to the customer properly without having a smile on there face while they acknowledge there slow and mixed up services not even giving customers a right portion for what they have payed for either giving less fries filling more then half cup with ice or giving less sauce then charging for asking for a little bit more which is just not acceptable and then on top of that showing attitude. There food is not a equal and fair portions customers are just wasting there money at this restaurant not getting the right potions paying way to much on top of that facing bad management rude employees. Don't even get me started with there oily and greasy food they serve most then 98% of there food is served soggy and not fresh the smell of there food is just not understandable while taking so much money not giving there customers the right to be serving there food with fresh food why are we paying so much for oily and disgusting old food just getting warmed up. Mixing up orders having to wait so long just to get a drink is just not even understandable why it takes so long just to get a drink forget how long it takes just to get a whole meal always so busy and takes forever just to get one simple order ready then on top of that getting nasty disgusting smelly oily food which isn't fresh at all does not make sense why they are taking the money and have such a big restaurant if they can't handle the basics of giving customers the rights of getting good customers services and getting the food they desire why they are managing and running such a good restaurant name . The cleanliness is just unbelievable having not such a big understand and having employees how is it even possible to have such a bad disgusting environment no clean tables chairs finding a place to sit on to eat is just a mission and if you accidentally go to the bathroom I can assure you'll never want to enter any restaurants bathroom which is just not realistic how disgusting a small restaurant can be while cleaning up wouldn't be so hard for them hence working in such a small place with many employees. Either the management can't clearly take responsibility for there employees behaviour for just disrespectful or even there own behaviour. This store doesn't have any right to being customers such bad services and experience severing bad food and wasting so much money on a restaurant like this I strongly hope to see a difference or closure to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Eeehhh.  I was really dragging butt today,  and needed a coffee. Passed starbucks....way too busy. Passed Mcdonalds....busy. do i dare drive all the way down to jack in the box....?  Seeing  only one car at burger king, i pulled into the drive thru lane.  The gal who took my order seemed  nice, but i couldnt really  understand what she was saying. I asked for a mocha frappe. She told me that she would have my total at the window.  Okay, why? What if i was paying cash, or needed to count change ? Why wait to tell me ? Just a pet peeve of mine, i guess.   Anyways, for under $3 i got a small \"mocha\" frappe.   Seriously,  gross.  It didnt have the chocolate -y taste of a mocha. It tasted  more like a bad hazelnut flavor to me. Took a few sips to make sure i wasn't crazy,  the full cup ended up in the garbage.    If the food is anything  like the coffee. ... im afraid.   Keep driving."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! There was no ice in the ice machine, the soda machine was broken, the food was cold even though it took about 15 minutes to prepare and get to the table. The staff were rude and every time I have been here they aways mess up my order."}
{"text":"Just heard about the 10-nuggets deal for $1.79 at Burger King, so went there for brunch. I was quite hungry and wanted more than 10 pieces. Hence, we decided to split 30 nuggets between two people alongside two drinks (pop and coffee). It totaled to almost $10, which was not bad at all.  The nuggets aren't as great as McDonald's - not as shaped and crisp in texture but they were still alright. Each 10 nuggets come with two dipping sauces. They didn't have honey mustard which I like, but was available to get the barbeque and sweet sour sauces. The line, however, was super slow. I think it took at least 15 to 20mins just to wait in line. It's not such a good option if you are in a hurry even though the nuggets are cheap."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, (manager & employee), working tonight. Personable, helpful, along with a clean restaurant and fresh made food.  Haven't been to a Burger King in quite awhile,.. as bad service and wrong orders kept us away.  However, this one has changed our view."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience here.  The small girl with the dark hair never seems to be in a good mood.  She is never engaging, never smiles, no emotion ever.  The ice machine in the dining area was out of ice.  I had to ask her to get me some ice.  She gave me my cup back with some ice in it but there was a BUG IN MY ICE!  I brought it to her attention and received NO APOLOGY, or any response from her! She just dumped the ice out and refilled it and handed me my cup back.  No \" I am sorry Sir this wont happen again I am terribly sorry\" NOTHING, ZERO, NO RESPONSE at all from this person.  I will be making a call to the health department in regards to this.  What if I was not paying attention and did not see the bug and ingested it?  Extra protein free of charge? I think not!"}
{"text":"Terrible.   I say I don't want cheese on the sandwich. She gets an attitude and says \"it doesn't even COME  with cheese\"  It ended up having two pieces of cheese on it.   Come on now. I've been here maybe three times this year. While I'm working I'll stop. They always have an attitude."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst place to ever get fast food at. This is the 3rd time I've gotten my chicken sandwich like this. You could literally find yourself at the dentist after eating this because all your teeth will fall off trying to bite it. Very disappointed and hungry."}
{"text":"worst burger king in America... will get your order wrong every time.  They don't mix your shakes, i ordered from grub hub and they have gotten my order incorrect twice now.  Will never go here again.  please don't make the same mistake i did, there's a very good jack in the box right next door.  The girl that works the front in the morning is very racist and if you're white, she wont even look you in the eye."}
{"text":"I've been going to this BK since I first moved to Vegas. It had been many years, since the last time I had gone in.   It was nice to see they renovated it, to give it a more modern appearance. As far as the dining room, I felt it was pretty clean.  The food is average... I can't say that it's any better than any other BK.  The reason I gave them 2 stars, is because the service was horrible! We waited 2 minutes before ordering. The girl at the counter was far from friendly. Then we waited 15 minutes for a Whopper, Fries, and a Salad.  I'll probably try them again, before giving up on them."}
{"text":"I've been back a few times, only because I work near here. Otherwise this is still consistently the worst BK I've ever been to. Luckily a Culver's is open right next door.   Last visit, only one counter person working the drive through and walk-up counter, lines at each. All the tables are filthy, trash all over the floor, drink spills on the floors, empty ketchup pumps, trash on the counters by the soda machines which are about the only things that are actually working properly in the whole place.   I wish the owner of this store would visit here once in a while to see why this place gets such poor reviews. This store in an embarassment to BK Corp.   I think I'm going to start taking photos inside and posting them here."}
{"text":"Worst Burger King I've ever experienced. Always, ALWAYS gets order incorrect. Literally the last 10 times I've ordered from this restaurant I've received something incorrect or not gotten what I ordered at all. Service is poor. Food presentation is poor. It's as if the requirements for working here are to give the worst possible service and to not care about the job at all. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT eat here."}
{"text":"This is the closest Burger King to me , so for convince purposes I go here.  There is a African American I believe he is a manager) who works here who has the nastiest attitude. I've had multiple encounters with him and each time his attitude is Piss poor !  Today I ordered a number one and I said I wanted a small fry and medium drink (this is normal and what I get)  I get to the window and I give the young women my card and she charges me the 8.67 and then handed my receipts I noticed that he charged me for a large drink and a medium fry. I didn't think it was a big deal so I mentioned it to Him and he exhaled really loudly and slammed the window , and so I'm sitting there amazed. He goes inside of the drawer and almost throws me my dollar (which is the price difference of what I was originally charged , even though I paid with my card he didn't even bother to ask me if I wanted it back on the card or cash) and of course he didn't apologize.  After my food was ready he flung that bag into my hand , and then handed me my drink with a lot of force , and then slammed the door again in my face.  I've worked in customer service for years ! And I have never treated ANYONE like that , and I have NEVER been treated like that before in my life.  As a loyal paying customer, I see how he treats me and other customers I can only imagine how he treats his co-workers. I hope there is change that is made , because this will be my last time going to this burger kind EVER again !!!!"}
{"text":"The manager \"Amanda\" sucks. One of the many items I ordered today was a chicken sandwich. Instead of getting one piece of chicken on a nicely toasted bun like I usually get I got two small cold chicken pieces on a burnt bun. After seeing what was obviously a mistake I went straight back and Amanda refused to refund my money for the meal because she thought some of my fries had been eaten out the bag. Even if that were true why make a big deal over fries when YOU screwed up my order and I had to drive all the way home and then back. It's not like I went back asking for gas money or something crazy I simply wanted what I paid for that meal. See the picture I uploaded of this disgusting crap they gave me. That's what I get for trying to eat this crap anyway. Amanda SUCKS!! When I asked for her managers name she kept saying \"my manager Jose is going to tell you the same thing\". IS THAT TRUE JOSE?"}
{"text":"They don't make burgers in the mornings with out a wait. No problem. So I waited and they brought my food. I get home and it's breakfast food not burgers. I hate breakfast food so my dog ate like a champ and I had to go elsewhere for my burger."}
{"text":"This place has some of the most incompetent people to ever walk the earth working here. It reaffirms my belief that both the company and the food is shit. They had to remake my husbands order 3 times, tried to short him on change and then gave us dry old food as a result. I'm not asking for a lot here. Just for a simple job to be done correctly. Especially when we are paying for it. I understand BK underplays their workers so you get what you pay for, but I'm not paying for old stale food and bad attitudes.  I'm pretty sure chicken fries aren't supposed to be overlooked, bone hard and an inch long.... every single one."}
{"text":"We've eaten here once. Wife won't let us go back and instead we drive to the BK on Grand Ave (off of Reems). While my meal was fine (Whopper meal) her chicken sandwich tasted like the chicken was spoiled and she threw the meal away. Also, the lack of straws was ridiculous in an order that included a milkshake and a soda."}
{"text":"I love the Whopper, but I thought I'd try something different.  So I got the 10 piece chicken nuggets and fries.   The fries were very good.  But the nuggets were horrible.  I don't know if they were cooked in overly used oil, but they tasted like a combination of chicken, fish, and bad spices.   Maybe they were just a bad batch, but next time I want chicken nuggets, I'm going to McDonald's!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Burger King I have ever experienced. The vagrants camp out inside and out all day and hours of the night. They beg for money outside and sit around inside with carts and bags full of filthy dirty stuff, piling it on the tables and seats inside. They camp out near the doors outside and it's impossible to get in or out without them right in your face. The cashiers are always nice but there is not much they can do since they are working inside. Management/Ownership needs to step up and help with this issue that's causing a nuisance in the surrounding residential neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely disgusting I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and when I bit into it it was close to being raw I actually got really sick over that and I had to throw up. At least they were nice enough to give me any meal that I wanted"}
{"text":"They have updated the place since I last visited which is plus.   On the negative side, the food preparation was slow and they gave me the wrong order. Considering I did not visit during the lunch/dinner rush, this should not be the case. It took them almost 15-20 minutes to prepare the original order. Which, IMO, is not fast food.   The worst thing about this location was the fact that there are beggars (yes!) that roam freely and the management does nothing about it. I have rarely seen a beggar in Toronto or Canada and yet they found a way to make it here. Not acceptable!  I will go here for convenience and take out as the worst case scenario. Otherwise, me thinks not!"}
{"text":"Manager was disrespectful, I ordered my food and didn't accept my money because the twenty looked fake ! How is this possible!? So rude never coming back to this location EVER"}
{"text":"I always get the same thing when I go there Veggie Burger with Fries and Lrg sprite It's always made fresh and I get it piping hot. The employees have almost always been friendly too! My tip would be go after 4 when the Hs kids clock in"}
{"text":"Well just got here and the drive thru is blocked off. Called the store and they just told me they had to close. The \"main cook walked out just a little bit ago\". Really? And there 2 people in the store. I'm one of 4 vehicles that pulled up on the 10 min it took me time call and write this review. LAME. Sounds fishy."}
{"text":"This particular location is more SLOW & WRONG food than fast food...  I've uploaded two pics that show the issues... We came back to this location to give them another chance, but this just sealed the deal for us... For the prices, the lack of quality of the food and the mistakes done, we will not be going back to this location... If I could give this place no stars I would!!!"}
{"text":"Best BK there is!  Super fast, friendly staff, very clean, hot & fresh food every time.  Haven't done the drive through, so can't review that."}
{"text":"After having the chicken sandwich and nuggets at 6pm I became  incredibly ill with food poisoning at 2am."}
{"text":"The service that we received at this fast food restaurant was quite bad! Want to get cheated out of food and have horrible customer service to boot? This is your place! Drove through the drive through on this lovely November 2nd evening at 6:30pm and was met with an obviously very unhappy person who should not be interfacing with people AT ALL to be quite honest. She was very short for absolutely no reason from the get go. I continued to be courteous and her disposition never changed.   Ordered a Whopper with Bacon & Cheese (hold the tomato) meal, Homestyle cheeseburger with only ketchup meal, Nuggets, Fries and a drink.  Went home to find that although we checked and had 2 burgers, 3 fries and 3 drinks, that what should have been the Bacon Cheeseburger w/ no tomato was in fact a plain burger with tomato, mustard and ketchup. Really!? So 2 people couldn't manage to get 2 burgers properly put together and packaged with the 3 fries, nuggets and 3 drinks? Wow! And no, it was NOT busy at the time so there is not even that excuse to use (and I now know why.) The parking lot was next to empty, we drove right up to the ordering speaker and then immediately up to the window to pay and proceeded to sit there and watch the lady on the headset help her co-worker get the food ready. Thinking the days are numbered one his place.   Management really needs to think twice about the type of service they are offering, better training and oversight   and maybe even consider mystery \"shoppers\" like other businesses do. It is needed desperately to help turn things around.  Don't waste your money here for fast food y'all. Take a few extra minutes and head over to Cook Out and enjoy their burgers and fries for a MUCH better meal for your dollar!! Went through there just last week and ordered 3 meals in the drive through, with no problems!   You're welcome!"}
{"text":"Since opening, we have been to this Burger King 5 times. I will not be back for a couple months... That should give them time to figure everything out.  We have encountered issues with orders, prices, and wait times, despite visiting at various times of day. The staff appears to be new, not just to Burger King, but to speaking with people who are paying for products.  On my most recent stop, around 7am on a weekday, there was only one other car in the drive through. I ordered a breakfast combo with a large coffee. The items did not come on the screen. I was instructed to pull around to the window. When I got there, the price was more than $1 over what it should have been. I asked way, and this is where it got bad...  The attendant told me \"it just is, that's what it costs. What, you wanna look at the receipt?\" I said yes, \"I am going to look at the receipt.\" I was given  bag of food, then, he handed me the small receipt, without saying a word. I saw what it was, and decided not to make any more of an issue... BUT then, he gave me a cup of coffee that was not filled, followed by a handful of cream and sugar packets... Not in a bag, not in the bag with the food, just dumped them in my hand and closed the window again...  So, what was the problem with my order??  He rang each item in individually, resulting in a higher price. AND did not include the potatoes in the bag.   I stop for breakfast or coffee only once ever few weeks as a treat. $5 every day adds up, so my family avoids wasteful daily stops. This was my first \"treat\" in about 3 weeks and it was terrible. It was a waste of my time and my money AND cost me more off both than it should have."}
{"text":"Burger King is what it is. This location, however, has apparently decided to double as a halfway house for prostitutes and meth heads. In the morning, you'll find people sleeping on the tables. Throughout the day, you'll see a parade of people getting \"water cups\" and using the bathroom, who obviously are simply street trash. So, next time you're in there, keep in mind, ladies, the restroom was probably just used by a meth whore sprucing up after a \"date\". The employees apparently allow panhandling and loitering for hours at a time, by bums who wander in off the street. Today, a couple of guys were having a picnic with food they'd gotten, no doubt, with food stamps, from the grocery store. Last time I was in there, a couple of guys were bothering everyone in the dining room, selling perfume. The employees, including the manager, don't even raise an eyebrow to this behavior."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent the Burger King on Warm Springs in Henderson normally with satisfaction. A few days ago, we had an issue with the meat being dry and when we called to speak with a manager, Phillipe was very quick to handle the matter to our satisfaction. The restaurant is clean. We will continue our patronage."}
{"text":"For as slow as it was when I came in, it sure was dirty. From all the tables to the drink station.. even the ketchup packets I grabbed were sticky. The whole place made me feel gross. Why isn't anyone cleaning and wiping down tables since no one else was in the building? I probably won't be back again. I don't even wanna eat my food now. I'm disgusted."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's a burger king. You cant expect much. However, at the leat I would expect to be treated as an adult human being when talked to by another human being. My example started out simple enough. They got my order wrong. No huge deal. I asked for no onion and no mayo on my burger, which happened to be a double whopper. I had ordered through the drive through with my wife because we were pressed for time before a movie started. We started eating in the movie theatre parking lot, and I noticed that my burger had the two things that I asked not to be on it, after the drive thru repeated it back to me \"double whopper, no onion no mayo\". Again, not a deal breaker. I called and informed them that my burger was wrong. The guy who answered put who I could only assume was his manager, She Satan. She answered the phone and said, \"Yeah, you got a problem with your burger?\" No hello, nothing. I said,\"Yeah I ordered my burger with no mayo and no onion.\" She said, \"I find that hard to believe since our burgers don't come with onion or mayo.\" Now I am getting a little perturbed. You start off the phone call rudely, then you accuse your customer of lying. I said, \"I am looking at it right now, and it has both on my Double Whopper.\" She said, \"Oh, Double Whopper? That isn't a burger. \" Get the hell over yourself lady. After that, she was just playing with me. I said, \"Nevermond, I am never returning to this place again.\"   If you want to be treated like trash, go to this place."}
{"text":"I like their efficiency,  they are corteuos. 8 Use It Daily I think there is a good variety of food. I like their overall service.  Right on guys!"}
{"text":"I went in to get a chicken sandwich and get the person at the register was fine bit he kept looking at the lady to his left. I wanted a well done ch8cken sandwich I thought it was have it your way but the lady who's name was Patricia  who Is the manager said by health reg. You can't get it that way I stated well I don't want nothing  she continued to talk  disrespectful  I stated you are dealing with a customer please tend to the customer she stated I know him you can't get your sandwich how you want . She came around the counter and attempted to get verbally aggressive  the cops came and talked to me and said they been having issues with the her Patricia  the manager she is a bad rep for the BUSINESS  and her attitude is nasty"}
{"text":"Not much to say about the food because it your typical BK, however staff is awesome at this location! Every time I've gone, I've been greeted with employees who are happy and have a great contagious attitude!"}
{"text":"Don't come here often but whenever I do horrible service. Never a hello or how can I help you. You just get a \"what do you want?\". I actually don't blame the workers at all seeing how it's all kids working there. All the issues this place has is management and the owners. If they don't care then obviously the kids working there aren't gonna care. This is really pitiful BK and only come here cause it's not very far from me. I only recommend coming here if you absolutely want too."}
{"text":"They recently reconstructed this Burger King, making it the nicest upscale BK I've ever been inside! Two BIG flat screen TV's are up now!!! Really clean inside and quality, fresh food. The people working are also helpful and kind."}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by saying I know it's weird to write a review about a chain restaurant- we all know what to expect. BUT I just went through the drive through and the gentlemen at the window (Gilbert) had absolutely EXCEPTIONAL customer service skills. VERY polite and friendly. I'm gonna be honest... My order was wrong... But I feel so good about the experience that I'm eating it, enjoying it, and still writing a 5 star review. That's how great he was. (It's my fault for not checking the order screen, also. Whoops...)"}
{"text":"I go to BK when McD has a line around the building. Never a line at BK that I have seen. Their breakfast is especially good. Ham egg and cheese croissanwich. Yum! Delivery is quick. The team is nice. Out and on with your life!"}
{"text":"Since I missed the Mac Attack last time, I tried the Mac and Cheetos this go around. Turns out that I didn't miss much. The cheetoh concoction tasted burnt on the outside and very dry on the inside, unlike the commercial version. Perhaps got a bad batch, but this wasn't a great invention. Have not had a burger at BK in awhile and they don't compare to the basic McD's burger, way more bun than meat. The bite I took of the new Crispy Chicken sandwich tasted fine though."}
{"text":"Horrible. Only been there once since it opened and they completely screwed up half my order. I asked for a hamburger with ketchup only and when I received it, you guessed it, it had mustard and pickles on it as well. I also ordered 2 orders of onion rings but only got one. UGH, seriously folks, it's not that hard. I was the only one in the drive thru, so they weren't very busy. Another question is, why is it so small? I have kids that I take out to lunch once in a while and WON'T be taking them here. It's not \"inviting\". McDonalds, Wendy's and even Arby's are large and open. Plenty of seating. Eating at this BK feels like you're in a prison. It was super busy for the first month, mainly because of the coupons they sent out to people who live in the area. Sadly, this BK won't be around long. I guarantee it. Which stinks, because typically I like BK's food. Honestly? Go to Brighton Hot Dogs right across the street. You'll be greeted with a smile there. That's where I'll be."}
{"text":"I usually come here after work(because i work at the mall and it's right beside it)and every time i go here I'm just so disappointed. They are either \"closed\"(at 5pm on a Saturday!!!!) or the line takes forever. The food is subpar, but I'm just tired of it. I will definitely be finding a new go to for food when i get off work. I've left many complaints online and nothing has happened. I wish they would get their act together......."}
{"text":"I'm currently in the drive thru lane waiting, 10 minutes now and counting. Horrible. I should have settled for McDonald's across the street. -.-"}
{"text":"This is my worst Burger King  experience ever!  My chicken sandwich was so old it was like cardboard. After 15 mins waiting in drive Thur I had to go inside where I watched the \"cook\" taking burgers off the counter to take ingredients off to make custom orders.  And what is with all the street people. DO NOT EAT HERE they need to close I eat at all the surrounding restaurants and they are fine"}
{"text":"horrible horrible horrible...so i walk in...a mexican lady an her child were catered to...however yadira igroed me walking away without even acknowledging my presence...after 3 more passes finally she says what can i get you...how about a new attitude for yourself...plenty of ppl wolud love your job an do it 10x better with a smile...so i order fries...no w yadira was a chubby chic so i can only assume she eats fast food often...so why did i have to ask her would she eat the fries she wanted me to eat that i paid damn near $3 for...someone remind yadira how she gets paid...better yet give her more training or just get rid of her...she seems rude an racist...no wonder she wasn't wearing a name tag...smh...i will be sure to let the king know you guys suck...horrible job...please don't keep it up"}
{"text":"Partiendo que prefiero a la competencia...  Tiene mesas al aire libre, y si no te importa compartirla con la horda de palomas hambrientas durante el día y con los adolescentes de noche, es una buena opción para épocas primaverales.  Adentro es grande y siempre hay lugar para sentarse.  La atención, la limpieza y la sensación de seguridad no es el fuerte de esta sucursal.  Lo recomendable: Comprar para llevar... eso si, conviene estacionar, bajar, pedir, chequear e irse... el servicio para pedir con el auto es igual de pésimo que en la competencia.  Tiene buenas promociones, las hamburguesas, papas, aros de cebolla, son siempre bien recibidos por mi estomago... no así el sector cafetería.  Ahora que su gran competidor, abrió una sucursal enfrente podrían ponerse las pilas y mejorar en todos los aspectos... aunque sea por orgullo.  A favor: Estacionamiento enorme para este tipo de lugares, cubierto y descubierto, con acceso por 2 calles."}
{"text":"Will not stop here again. Went through the drive-thru and was told to wait for my order. Which is all fine, glad things were fresh... but didn't realize it would take 20 minuets to complete. When going inside was totally ignored by the uncaring staff. Just glad that this is not in my normal commute any longer."}
{"text":"Poor customer service and horrible food preparation.  Everyone has a bad day and I get that.  But time and time again this restaurant fails to perform basic fundamentals like making a simple cheeseburger.  I would be ashamed if I owned this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here after going to the outlet mall since there's not much of a selection of places to eat there. Just an average fast food burger joint. The service was good. But it was kinda dirty. The tables were filthy. Trash and crumbs. We had to tell the staff to if they could wipe the table we wanted to sit at. And the girl started wiping other tables before ours. Common sense would tell someone to clean the table that the person complained about first. Not last. And they were out of napkins. Bk needs to step it up. Oh yea, I ordered a bk bacon burger. And it had one tiny piece of bacon. No more than a inch long. One bite and there was no more bacon. I guess I'll keep avoiding bk. I should have stuck with my instinct."}
{"text":"I wish I can give a 0 star rating!  They have the worst service ever!  They got my order wrong, barely any of them speak English, and the manager was rude!  Workers like these give burger king a bad rep! Tsk tsk tsk!"}
{"text":"Here's a quick one.  Burger King? Ok.. Drive-thru? A little slow. Flame-broiled? Sometimes. Microwaved? Right in front of you. Napkins? Just one. Anything special? Yeah, its on Cheyenne & Rainbow.  Here's some advice, to avoid the microwave effect and get actual flame-broiled meat, ask for no cheese. On the buck doubles at least. Works everytime for me!"}
{"text":"Go somewhere else.  We order a sour dough meal. We got something totally different. Gave it back told them what and how we wanted the sourdough. We got something else again. Do yourself a favor go somewhere else. This place is run by people who don't know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Let me start with I have seen cleaner homicides than their bathroom /: I should've left but I was starving. Place not even busy stood there for 5 minutes to get ask \"what you want?\" I ordered sausage croissant meal w coffee to go.  The sandwich cold, the hash browns hard enough to break a tooth.I know its fast food but come on. Now sitting at dr office starving.  NEVER AGAIN BK"}
{"text":"When you buy 4 Whopper meals you expect when you drive home to have 4 whoppers in the bag. NO not this time we got 3 Whoppers. But the girl at the window winked and assured us it was all here. Guess i wont be eating lunch today."}
{"text":"First the good about the Establishment.  Great Location, Most of the time clean, except the fly's. Now for what needs to be looked into besides the fly's that you have to keep off your food.  There were 2 girls working the drive through.  Snippy over the speaker while receiving order.  Finished the order with asking \"is THAT ALL.\" Talked to fast with the due amount along with letting the speaker cut off mid talk.  Arrived at the window and with the sun shining directly on the drive through window in the PM, showed how dirty her long finger nails were.  YUCK those dirty finger nails were touching my food. Sure the top was all acrylic, but at eye level with the sun just right... crud and a touch of red from long term crud under the nails.  Isn't there something about no finger nail polish or long nails in the health code for food handlers?"}
{"text":"Twice I've gone to this Burger King and twice the workers are rude.  Whatever you do, don't ask Bianca for a take out bag for your food.  Her eyes roll up so high that I thought she might be having a medical issue."}
{"text":"Worse BK ever. We decided to come here off the hwy but of course it's very far off the hwy. Customer service was horrible. We waited in line for 20 minutes before they even came to take our order. Keep in mind there was about 6 people in front of us also waiting. Not only that after they took our order we had to wait another 20 minutes to get our food. They had nothing made or prepared. Looks like the may have been short staffed as well. Either that or they just don't care and is goofing around. But now I know why they have such bad reviews and little stars."}
{"text":"Every single time we go to this location they screw up our order. Just yesterday they forgot our chicken sandwich. We went back today because we couldn't go back yesterday to get the sandwich they missed. Also bought a whopper and we asked for no onion. They gave us a whopper with just ketchup. Seriously?! If you come to this location check your order before you leave!!! Make sure they make your order the right way too."}
{"text":"I come here all the time with my son who loves the chicken tenders.  Food is 'OK' although my favorite is the BK stacker which seems to have gotten smaller and smaller over the past few years and the price is probably higher.  Well overall the price is still pretty cheap depending on what you go for so I will always consider BK when I need a cheap meal."}
{"text":"This was the worst BK experience I can remember ever having.  It was just me and my 5yr old son.  I ordered a Bk stacker combo meal with no sauce, and a 4 piece chicken nugget kids meal for my kid.  After waiting for about 10 minutes I walked back towards the counter assuming my food should be done any second.  While standing there they called out 2 order #'s that were after mine.  I seen several kids meals going out the drive through window also.  So I stand all the way by the pickup counter waiting for someone to come by so I can ask, and I get ignored for several minutes.  Finally a supervisor person tells me my order is coming up next, so of course I wait a few minutes when they place a tray of food out and call out the #.  Guess what, not my order either.  So the supervisor asks what my order was and I hand him my reciept.  He does not apologize for the wait or anything but turns and yells my order to some cooks.  He then asks me what sauce we want for the kids nuggets, I ask for Ranch and he hands me like 6 ranches, like that will make up for now having to wait like 20 minutes.  Again no apology for the long wait and basically them losing or forgetting my order.  Than when I get the food, it was sloppy, burger patties hanging half way out the side of the bun...just a mess."}
{"text":"Best customer service I've ever had!!! Brandon who took my order had so much enthusiasm and passion for what he does. He was cracking jokes the whole time and totally made me laugh even during such a brief encounter.  The food is fast food what do you expect, but I'd totally eat here a million more times to receive such great customer service.  Brandon needs a promotion!!!"}
{"text":"Okay if you're a burger joint you need to have burgers. Fix your broiler get the beef and get right!    Where's the beef????  Not at BK in Boulder! Get it together man!!!"}
{"text":"The employees here are so kind, sort of reminds me of Chick-fil-A service. I've never had any problems with my food, I love this Burger King :)"}
{"text":"This BK is the only BK on the Strip.  Well, bully for them!  It's located way in the back of O'Shea's casino and looks runned down.  We were forwarned that they could not get a shipment of tomatoes due to inclement weather in Utah, where their tomatoes come from. So, I was stuck with a \"salad\" that was basically lettuce and cheese.  Yup, that's their today's version of salad.   The Jr. Yelpers ended up with burgers (including a Jr. Whopper) without tomato.  They have dine-in seats but the atmosphere was unappetitizing.  Even the onion rings which I generally like at most BKs, didn't taste as good at this place.  While leaving the casino, Jr. Yelpers spotted a leprechaun walking about the casino.  In other words, a small person in a green costume.  OK, entertainment for the kids is included here."}
{"text":"Service is really shoddy here. I dunno why they even bother employing people that don't give a damn about serving others. I have seen many customers walk in and out simply because of the service alone.   The only thing worth coming here for is Monday & Wednesday Whopper Days. Surprising enough this is the only thing they can make here that actually is good.   Come here if you really don't have any other eating options."}
{"text":"This burger king was the absolute best... Lol just kidding it fucking sucks ass, and they always get order wrong!"}
{"text":"As far as food quality goes BK is a BK... I have always gotten friendly service here and in the many times I have been there they have never gotten my order wrong, which is what makes it 3 stars when most fast food has to fight for 2 stars from me. My bun has never been crusty and my food has never been cold. It's my go-to stop on overslept school days for a dependably fast breakfast. (No one likes a hungry first grader.)  I often stop just for fountain pop (I love fountain pop) and it has never had too much syrup or soda water. The staff does not take offense or act unconvinced by my small order, which is a reaction I have gotten at many other fast food places.  Fast food isn't my favorite,  but in a pinch it does the trick. I know I will stop here again. Most likely the next time I hit snooze too many times."}
{"text":"25 Nov 2015 - Food was disgusting but not as bad as the manners of the staff.  They obviously think they are there to have fun, and don't care if the fun interferes with good service.  Be prepared to wait while they chat or goof around, don't say anything cause you don't know what they'll do to the food.  Their chatter is vulgar. On a subsequent visit, because I was in desperate need of a washroom (thought maybe a coffee would be safe) the ladies room was filthy.  Someone had deposited their waste in the toilet and not flushed and the whole ladies room stank.  I had to hold on till I could find another washroom, because the stench made me want to vomit."}
{"text":"I went to this Burger King via drive-thru yesterday. I ordered 2 Bacon DOUBLE Cheeseburgers plain. I paid for 2 Bacon DOUBLE Cheeseburgers plain. I received 2 Bacon cheeseburgers plain. Since it was drive thru I didn't discover this until I was all the way back at my office.   I filled out the online survey and stated I wanted to have someone contact me. It has been 24 hrs and  I  have had no contact. This seems about on par with Burger King. In the past there were a couple locations I filled out the survey, asked for someone to contact me, and heard nothing.   I think it is about time I take them off my list of acceptable dining locations."}
{"text":"BK used to be better, but lately the quality has gone down a lot.  For whatever reason the old burgers I used to get served hot are now coming out with cold cheese on them.  I am pretty sure they used to throw them in some type of steamer to melt the cheese and make the burger hot, but now it's always cold.  Also, the burgers have gotten smaller and the fries are usually just luke warm.  For fast food, I used to like BK a little more, but now they rate near the bottom of my fast food burger preferences."}
{"text":"This is fast food so it's obviously nothing too special.  You get exactly what you would expect.  I mostly enjoy coming to BK because of the cheap menu items.  A simple BK Stacker/Fries/Drink/ and a sundae will cost me less than $6.  This specific place is usually fairly clean and the service has been good."}
{"text":"We used the drive through and ordered two Whoppers and a fry.  The fries were limp.  The buns were coming apart/flaking off and the meat tasted like \"nothing\".  Suspect they had been cooked  a along time ago,  Definetly not even warm..  Best part of the meal was the catsup and napkins."}
{"text":"This is the WORST experience I've encountered at a fast food place. Placed my order through the drive thru. The cashier was in a hurry and had my receipt crumbled with my change and handing to me fell on the ground. While I was putting the receipt in my purse she handed me my food and closed the window. I got out the car grabbed my change on the floor and said how rude. She opened the window when I told her ik she's in a hurry but at least apologize she shut the door while I was talking!! Then the manager came and apologized and the cashier in the background said, \" you dropped it I didn't.\" When you work in customer service this is NOT how you treat your customers. I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN AND WOULD RECOMMEND NO ONE HERE EITHER!! Worst customer service ever!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband always buy here after doing groceries at Wal-Mart. They have the best customer service and the store is very clean. I love their poutine so much.!"}
{"text":"I stopped by their drive through to pick up a Whopper Jr. and a coffee on the way back from a teeth cleaning. I was in and out in about 30 seconds.   Me: Wow, you guys were fast! Her: We try, it's what keeps our customers happy. :D  No other fast food joint builds burgers like BK - charbroiled taste and generous with the toppings. I went to McD's once and asked for extra lettuce - they charged me $0.25. Do you know what $0.25 will get you at BK? A small coffee*.  Their hot drinks come with lids that let you seal the opening so if you're on a bumpy road you won't get coffee all over your dash. Also, free WiFi and half price on the flavor of the month shake, this friendly BK location is on my short list.  *25-cent coffee was a special for the month of March."}
{"text":"Went through the Drive-Thru and was waiting for the food.  Looking through the window I saw and heard an employee coughing and he coughed on the food. He didn't bother to cover his mouth or anything.  I became very disgusted and will not return to this location."}
{"text":"I do not frequent Burger Kings because their food just isn't my favorite, but this one is not even a minute away from my apartment, so I've stopped here twice & both times the employees are what made me reconsider this fast food chain. They seem to really enjoy their jobs & I don't think there's anything better than someone who is happy while at work."}
{"text":"This Burger King is on a very busy street and by comparisons to other Burger Kings is relatively small but the service is really quick.  It is very clean and the attendants were very professional and helpful."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, I could literally hear the customer service representative huffing and puffing over the intercom, I get someone has to work at fast food places but if you have a problem with it do not choose that establishment as your place of work."}
{"text":"I haven't stopped by a Burger King in awhile so decided that's exactly for an evening snack. What a mistake! I placed my order in the drive thru and proceeded to the second window. I waited patiently for over five minutes for the single car ahead of me to receive its order. I then received my order and headed out on my way home. I reached into the bag and pulled out a burger, and took a bite. I hot a mouthful of saliva sucking bun, burger, pickle and cheese; nothing else. This was a dry burger. I switched to the second burger and experienced the same thing; a dry burger. Sooooo looong Burger King; you don't satisfy me!"}
{"text":"TRUST ME, SAVE YOUR MONEY.  I know, I said I wouldn't but like a fool I tried again, and again I am sorry!! As crap as BK is normally, this location sets new standards for crap! DO NOT EAT HERE!! YOU WILL BE SORRY!!"}
{"text":"Literally waited in the drive through 10+ minutes. No response. Guy in the car behind me got out and asked me if I was going to order it was taking so long. Waited another 5 min. Drove to first window sat another few mins waiting for someone no one came. Went to the next window. No one there either. Left went across the street to McDonald's as I should have originally."}
{"text":"I'm here on Saturday at noon the place is busy but not crazy busy the girl with the short pink hair took my order and it's messed up. Not sure exactly how you mess up a large number 1 with cheese but she achieved it. Staff here is not very attentive & seem frustrated and overwhelmed, well the one person I dealt with anyways. I eat fast food all the time and never come to Burger King for this reason. They've never gotten their staff training correct. Hopefully someday they can fix this issue because I actually really enjoy the food."}
{"text":"This location is ok if you don't mind seeing the manager sitting in the middle of the dining area on her computer and PLUCKING THE HAIR FROM HER CHIN.  WT."}
{"text":"This place should be closed. A young black girl attempted to overcharge me at the counter for a whopper and when I questioned the amount and asked to speak to a MANAGER a very LARGE Black woman with a serious attitude came to the counter and claimed the POSTED menu price was not the correct price but she would give me a discount. The ground beef patty was cold and sandwich was the sloppiest mess (2 tomatoes on top of one another, rubber pickles, brown lettuce and a smashed bun inside of crumpled paper) I have ever been served. The fries were HEAVILY SALTED. The ICE machine was empty and the ketchup dispenser was empty. The MENS restroom trash can was overflowing and smelled bad. The receipt with my survey code on it was NOT LEGIBLE so I could not report this to their customer service area. I am a former Burger King customer and will never visit this location again while the current workers are allowed to continue working there. These young girls working here think it is cute to giggle and laugh about a service problem instead of taking care of their business and serving the customer good food."}
{"text":"Ok so normally I don't do reviews on the typical everyday quick fast stop places like Walmart or CVS, Albertson, Mc Donald's, the Gas Station or \"Burger King\" but since they brought out this Black Halloween Burger I thought you guys might be a little interested in hearing about it.   So here it is, It's weird! LOL there's nothing wrong with the burger itself it's the typical Whooper and I love me some whooper sometimes very yummy blah blah blah everyone knows how a Whooper taste like but it's got a little bit of a kick with the hint of A1 sauce which is a nicely welcome taste I think not too overwhelming but the bun yet yummy and fun it was just the weirdest thing to bit into a super Black bun and have it play a mind trick in your brain.   All in all you gotta try it once it's good and you have to experience it for yourself to know what I'm talking about and how triply it is. Have fun an Happy Halloween oh and yes if you've heard the rumor about the after math it's true, not to be gross or anything but it is greener in the other side, Yikes hope that doesn't ruin you appetite."}
{"text":"very friendly staffs, we come here quite a lot when in a rush before work. They are usually quick and on top of our order, just so happen today wasnt a good day. Didnt get our order corret and were really rushing."}
{"text":"After you finish your whopper, smell your hands. They will smell like B.O., no joke. When a burger makes your hands smell like human body odor, it makes you wonder what exactly is in the meat?"}
{"text":"Came here at 10:30 pm and they were closed. Site says 11:00 pm. Someone is simply not doing their job. I'm saddened.  Damn. I was drunk. But still, very saddened..."}
{"text":"Took my 3 year old son for a quick dinner and play. Staff was friendly food was good. Restaurant was clean. Play area was clean which was nice. Bathrooms were clean too. Was excited to see hand sanitizer. Play land was small and for toddlers. Not good for a child who does not climb.  Perfect for dinner and a little play time."}
{"text":"If it's lunchtime, you're hungry, and you have a boarding time that's coming up soon, I would maybe skip coming here.  The line at this Burger King gets pretty long during lunch hours, and the employees haven't figured out a way to process their many customers in a more expedient manner. It took about 20 - 25 minutes for me to get in line, order my food, and sit down with my meal.  One perk of there being so many customers though is that everything has to be made fresh. Those were some of the hottest fries I've ever had!  Other than that, the food here is pretty standard for a Burger King."}
{"text":"The dude that drives a orange impala will tell you they're doing a daily close no matter what time it is on Friday. He's a joke"}
{"text":"Wow! Not a single popular soda available inside. No coke, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, sprite, diet sprite.. really? My burger also sitting for 10 minutes before they finally gave it to me."}
{"text":"I am so disgusted with this place. This morning I ordered breakfast. I order oatmeal with NO FRUIT. I order 2 Cinnamon rolls and a 3 piece French toast sticks. I received Oatmeal with fruit and 2 Cinnamon rolls that were hard a rock. How hard can it possible be to microwave some food."}
{"text":"No flame-broiled \"have it your way\" goodness here.  The burgers are microwaved, the fries are right next to the line of customers waiting to order. Nothing to stop greasy kids from reaching in and touching them, or from Suzie Sicky from sneezing all over them.   I had a late landing here and wanted to grab something to eat before heading to my hotel. Burger King was one of the few options available (if not the only one).  The cashier was filthy (hands/shirt), and could barely understand my order. He got it wrong and proceeded to argue with me until I said I wasn't paying $4.00 for a plain cheeseburger (it was $2.50). Finally, he called his supervisor who sorted it out (he thought I had ordered a double).  Ugh. Frustration after a flight is the last thing you need.   Skip this place.  It would be better to go hungry than to eat here."}
{"text":"It is a convenient for my lunch when I am at work, it just about few minutes drive from my work to pick up my lunch. The price is very average, the hamburgers is okay including fries and drinks that for me no complaints about it! I only work here about two weeks and pick up my lunch here about five or six times already. I truly recommended!"}
{"text":"I totally agree with zero stars! I went to this location  last night 1/24/17. I order burger and onion rings. The burger bun was cold and hard, onion rings barely warm and overcooked! I didn't  know this place had previously burned down and I wouldn't be sad if it did again. They Need a whole new staff who understands customer service, cleanliness, and food quality because the staff that I encountered last night doesn't! I noticed the black girl that made my order put her Nasty unloved hand on top of my onion rings! She definitely Needs a class in food handling. Next time I will share my reviews with State Health department :("}
{"text":"For me this location is off the beaten path. I am in here once every 6 months or so. When I do go here the food and service are what I expect from Burger King. I don't see any particular issues or problems here."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter if the drive thru screen is correct & you're the only one there, they'll still screw up your order."}
{"text":"I just went thru the drive thru and had the nicest man suggest what I get, got it ready in a timely manner, and took my payment with a smile. I've never had someone be so kind and thankful in a drive thru. My food was hot and fresh at 10PM, which is rare at a fast food place, usually the food at the end of the night isn't up to par but both the food and service were excellent and I hope the employees working tonight (Jan 17) get credit for their hard work"}
{"text":"This might be the worst burger king on the whole planet! Took them 12 minutes to make 2 hot dogs, I came inside the ALL the tables were filthy I had to clean it myself, the girls behind the counter were rude! And to add insult to injury they burnt the hot dogs. When I call to tell them what happened I just keep getting a busy signal. Laveen needs to step it's game up, next time I'm going to the McDonald's up the street."}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero I would. None of these people know how to do their job. They always tell me to pull upfront. Why the fuck do I need to pull up for 3 ice creams & these people want $15 an hour. Smh."}
{"text":"I really hate giving bad reviews...but this place was terrible! Lazy service, sticky tables and floors, garbage cans half emptied and sitting out of their bins, stale food, puddles of ketchup on the floor, a chicken bone on the floor in front of the register (which we mentioned and watched them walk passed several times while never picking up) and there weren't even any customers to give them the excuse of being super busy. There have been 4 smoke breaks at the front door in the 30 minutes we've been here. Twice by the manager. It's a shame because the place is somewhat pretty, but the manager is letting it die! Serious problem with work ethics. Sad really."}
{"text":"I am not a fast food person but there are times that I need to have my fix right away.  It's close to where I live and very convenient the location.  The staffs are friendly but SLOW!  It's fast food NOT fast service.  So it's really testing my patience at times.  Other than that,  I've been here several times."}
{"text":"This was as bad as it gets.  I waited in the drive through that evening for 5 minutes before driving up to the window.  I assumed there was something wrong with the speaker or mike.  When I got to the window there was 2 guys chatting with each other and very loud music playing inside.  I sat there for about 3 minutes while being completely ignored.  I finally left.  I promise I will never go through that drive through again."}
{"text":"Slowest BK ever? Quite possibly. It's a new-ish looking and pretty BK. Always very clean inside. But it takes forever to get through the drive-thru, even when you are literally the only customer. And you have to repeat your order numerous times. And then the chances are it is still probably incorrect. And this seems to happen no matter when you go. The food tastes the same as any other BK. And at least the food is always hot. It's definitely not the greatest of BK locations. But hey, it's fast food. So you need to have low expectations."}
{"text":"Worst BK I've ever been to! Every time I give this place a try it's the same story. Should take 5 minutes to get a nice cream cone. Shouldn't take 10 for a whopper jr and a chicken sandwich. DO NOT COME HERE!"}
{"text":"Three stars for the food and no stars for the employees. The entire staff is hard to understand due to their accents and they don't understand special orders. They are rude and sloppy. They never thank you for your order."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. They were out of fresh catchup. I asked them if they had anymore or if they could fill the container back up. A mgr behind the table offered me package catchup. I informed her that I would rather have fresh catchup. She rolled her eyes and as someone to go fill it. When employee said are we out she reply \"I guess\". At no point after employee fill the container the mgr come to tell me or offer to bring some to the table.  Keep your money and go to Mc Donald where your business is appreciated.   This place is inside of a gas station with very poor attitude."}
{"text":"Ordered a fish sandwich. Not edible! Looked like it was deep fried 3 times. Brought it to the counter and asked if this was the way a fish sandwich should look. Employee said, \"yeah, that's the way they look. I left it on the counter and went next door to McDonalds. How can Berger King stay in business???"}
{"text":"We are not fast-foodies but decided to grab a bite.  Unimpressed!! A double cheeseburger, fish sandwich, chicken sandwich Jr, fries, onion rings and the chicken fries we wanted to try -- all were terrible, meaning they must have sat a good hour before I drove up. I only live in the next block and everything was cold and hard when I put it on the table. Onion rings were good though.   Owners/Franchisees listen up.  Your employees are not doing your business justice.  Would I go there again? Not even if it's the only place left in the world!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of fast food chains but the Big Breakfast here at Burger King or whatever the meal that comes with scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and pancakes is called is amazing! Better than Denny's even and cheaper. I can eat breakfast here everyday for the rest of my life. I'm a vegetarian so I ask them to replace the saugage with an extra hashbrowns. Mcdonalds always refuses to replace the saugage for something else so Burger King beats them automaticay. I will never go to Mickey D's for breakfast if there is a Burger King around."}
{"text":"My experiece with them is a so so to below average. Not too long ago, I had purchased a meal deal through drive through one morning. I was told to park in the front and wait for my food, I noticed two customers after me was told to park in the front as well. after 5 minutes of waiting I noticed one of the employees had a meal, she denied it was mine. Patience was not a virtue with me that day. The Second customer after me got his meal. Noticing that I was first and had not yet gotten my food was not right. So I walked in and asked whats goin on with my order, the employee asked for the second time what I had ordered *the order she denied it was my order was really mine*.  I did call the manager that morning and expressed my dismay for a lack of communcation and slow food. He did the right thing and gave me a complementary meal and he had let me know what went wrong that morning (the cook was MIA). when I had showed up at the store, he had personally came from his office and apologized for the mess up.    I thought all was well until I had ordered my comp meal that the employees may have been messing with me? (its just a theory). Three other customers after me got their meal before I did. So I had walked over to the shift manager and asked if my meal was ready, his stupid ass response was \"I was wondering why that sandwich was sitting there\". I got my food and left.  I would travel a distance in the other direciton to another burger king that has excellent speedy service vs this one.  I'm glad that I dont have stock in this company.  One star:  For the store Manager (my cost management professor would be proud for his actions, doing everything in his power to make the guest happy; giving me a comp meal). Two Star: free meal"}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst burger king i have been to. Managers are very rude card readers are always down cash only. Probably trying to make up for lost or stolen money. I will be calling corporate on this matter. Horrible place go to mc donalds across the street instead always busy but way nicer and helpful no problems there"}
{"text":"Discovered a few decent cheap items while working nearby for a month.  $1 the Chicken JR. - mini crispy chicken patty with cool mayo and fresh lettuce.  $1: French toast sticks...3....soft and crunchy with enough syrup for all three.  Anything else is a gamble."}
{"text":"Meh. Just like any other Burger King ... I can never figure out if they are planning to shut down soon because everything looks so outdated. Maybe they are going for the old school look .. I'm not too sure.  Got 10 chicken nuggets for $2  For some reason once I made me order I had to wait a good 5-10 minutes even though it was around 9pm and the place was close to empty. The person after me got their burgers first and also had a huge mix up with their order aswell.   I really didn't see how they can get so confused over nothing but whatever."}
{"text":"I arrived at this particular location at 1602 on  6/11. Apparently they were in the midst of dinner rush. 3 customers were served in the drive through before anyone even greated me at the counter. My order was placed at 1606. I wasn't given my large drink cup yet... between 1606 and 1622, 3 employees came out from behind the counter to get drinks for themselves.... no cup yet. My order was given to me at 1622, 16 minutes after placing the order. In the mean time 7 customers were served in the drive through.   I guess I'll just keep my lazy butt in my car and be served faster than someone who actually comes inside.  Lake Mead and Rampart.... NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"They forgot my bbq sauce. Cause nuggets taste sooooooo good without sauce. *sarcasm* They were also super rude, and basically threw the bag at me. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"While I typically like Burger King's burgers, the customer service at this location is a nightmare. I rarely frequent this location just because of their awful attitudes. I don't need to pay people to treat me like I'm bothering them to do their jobs."}
{"text":"Oh Burger King, you had your friends going for you and then you went and changed them thus forsaking my love.  This particular location is right in the middle of the action in East Carson Street (mostly 'cus I don't think SSW is action-able, haha).  It's grungy.  It can be dirty.  On a good day service is average, the rest of the time you wonder why you even bothered to show up.  BUT ... once in a while you just get a craving for some artery clogging red meat product patty, greasy fries, and pop and that's what BK is there for!"}
{"text":"Every single time I try to eat here for breakfast, they are out of most of the items on the menu.  Today they were out of biscuits and muffins. I asked why they don't prepare for people and make more. They said they only make 7 muffins in the morning. It's pretty simple, if it's on your menu, you need to serve it. If you are running low, then make some more. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"My last meal in vegas.  Who doesn't like a whopper with all the fixings?  Sure it's like 3 bux overpriced, but it's a whopper.  Have it your way!"}
{"text":"Best Burger king ever! The only thing missing would be for them to serve beer. Super clean, new looking and just the best burger kind I've been too. The menus are electronic screens which makes it look modern and classic. I'm dying to try this picture I saw of a ice cream sundae with bacon! They even have things like sweet potatoes fries which is different. They have a cool vending machine for soda the one where you can mix the sodas. Free wifi, but no outlets. Nice and cool inside, and lots of parking, its right next to barnes and noble and bank of america next to the metro mall.   *also they have this amazing deal going on BK happy hour $1 small fraps and smoothies yum!! 3-5pm everyday, I go here for a mid afternoon coffee break!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give it 0 stars!!!!! We have been here numerous times and every time it worst than the last. This last time was the last straw. We WILL NOT be eating there anymore!  The play place room is RIDICULOUSLY scorching hot! I am in a wheelchair and have health issues. So a hot room like this makes me sick! Also my daughter almost threw up her food. So we had to pack up our food and leave earlier than we wanted to. We asked the staff if they could turn on the A/C, and their response was that they tried to tell the owners the AC was broken and they wouldn't fix it... Um okay. Not a good business move when you have a business in Las Vegas!!!  Every time I get a breakfast sandwich from here it is burnt! So annoying! There is no excuse for the cooks to deliberately wrap up a Burt sandwich and send it out. PA-Lease! Obviously you don't give a crap!   Also every time we went through the drive thru, the person taking the order did to know the menu and didn't know how to take an order. We had to repeat ourselves countless times, and not only did we wait in the drive thru for over 20 min, when we got our order it was wrong.   PLEASE, If you're wanting a whopper go to a different BK! This place sucks!"}
{"text":"Playground would have been fun IF the room it was in wasn't an OVEN!!!!!!! Absolutely NO A/C!!! The food was ok, but it's not a good business move to not have the. A/C blasting in the summer in Las Vegas! Everyone in there was sweating and it smelled like BO! Not a fun place to eat. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"REALLY NO burgers at BURGER KING!!  I can not believe a manager would let this happen!! If I wanted chicken I would go to KFC. The French fries were COLD too. How does McCarren keep them here. Get rid of them and bring in Steak n Shake or In n Out!!!!"}
{"text":"Got my order wrong, rushed me through my order didn't even offer me a drink or the meal, horrible service. I didn't pay $6.37 for a hamburger. It's not hard to get things right that are that simple. I don't get it."}
{"text":"2 stars for free wifi that works & one outlet yay!! Place is dirty and your older burger king when given a choice I'd go to the one on Peoria ave next to metro center mall and barnes and noble, love that one clean, new looking, free wifi. I just love their cleanliness I feel like a clean service area = a clean kitchen! This location was dirty, I washed my hands in the bathroom and it was not very clean. They do however have this deal going on pretty amazing! $1 for a small caramel frap, mocha frap and smoothies for $1 dollar yes!! beat the summer heat with a refreshing ice cold drink from BK! lots of parking"}
{"text":"Tried the new carolina bbq whopper jr., I can't really taste a big difference from a regular whopper. Almost the same sauce, exactly the same one-touch-falls-apart ingredients.  The place seems to be a little bit dark, the line up area has the metal railing, which would be a good thing, only if they can speed up the service.  I saw a guy waiting for his food before I order, and after I got mine (which is like 5 minutes later), he is still waiting..."}
{"text":"This burger king was sooooo nice. Cassidy was the cashier and while i looked up at the board deciding what we wanted, she did not give me any impression she was irritated as what I normally feel at fast food places. In fact she was the opposite. She asked me to take my time. She offered me coupons. She even waited for me to finish getting my drink to let me know my food was ready. I felt very welcomed here and would definately come back and recommend this burger king for everyone! Cassidy deserves a raise or sometype of mini award, because these kinds of employees you want to keep!"}
{"text":"So I got chicken nuggets at this location and I live across town and I got home to eat them and I found a hair in the chicken nugget! It was so disgusting that I called and I think the manager talked to me and he was rude about it so I hung up. Plus when I was ordering it in the drive threw they were rude when taking my card so I recommend not to go to this location!"}
{"text":"Either my English muffin sandwich sat under a hot lamp all morning OR Burger King's kitchen staff just decided to deep fry the whole damn thing.  If that's not enough, the sausage smelled of animal decay.  Just awful."}
{"text":"Service is garbage. The workers will literally ignore you in the drive through. I went there and the gal in the window hid until they closed. I complained to corporate as well and they dont care. Nothing came of it. Dont waste your time. Their food is not worth the frustration. Id recommend the jack in the box across the street instead."}
{"text":"Bring back the chicken fries! Pretty please? Those were the greatest thing to happen at a BK. But alas, they are gone. The Icee Coke still exists, though. And hey, those chicken nuggets aren't too shabby. If I close my eyes, it's almost like a chicken fry. Get the buffalo AND ranch dipping sauces. Makes for a tasty treat. This particular location is fresh and new feeling. The drive-thru always moves quickly. The staff aren't exactly perky and friendly, but who can really blame them. A correct order is all I'm after."}
{"text":"Have been there several times and it's always super slow. It had been months since we had gone there so today we went there and the girl at the counter just finished a counter order, saw us, and went to drive through. We stood there for 15 minutes waiting for somebody to take our order. Fed up, we left and went to Culver's."}
{"text":"I went to this location and there was hair in me and my friends food and not just one piece of hair there was 5 pieces of hair in my tater tots. I brought it back in and she corrected it but at that point it made me not hungry because it was disgusting. None of the employees wear hair nets when they are making food."}
{"text":"I had been craving turkey burgers in a big way, saw the add for Burger King & thought pehaps it would be a good idea to give it a try, wrong! The turkey burger was bland, and it was covered in ketchup, gross, got about 5 fries and a cup low on soda and full of ice,7 bucks of so not worth the money! Good thing the sign said it's only around for a limited time! You have been demoted to Burger Prince, I'll stick to buying and making them at home!"}
{"text":"Girl who took my order which was surprisingly happy with her voice. Love seeing happy nice people. Was busy when I went hot food"}
{"text":"This is got to be the worst fast food restaurant I've ever been to. The last time I was there I ordered a whopper with cheese and They forgot to put cheese on the whopper. Also my fries were cold actually every time I've ever been there The fries have been cold. I'm not a shrinking violet so I took my order back to the counter. I asked for to be remade, telling them what the problems were. The guy making the sandwiches took the one I had and slung around.  throwing part of it on the floor. That's when I decided I had enough I told them I didn't need slop and demanded money back. Burger King is horrible don't go there to try to keep adding menu items and they can't get their basics right. They should concentrate on having the best burgers and fries master that then add a chicken sandwich. And then whoever said they had Ghetto staff I don't know about that but I do know they don't have good manners. Just don't go it's horrible."}
{"text":"It is about the same as the others.  A little hard to get in and out of the parking lot.  At the top of the hill on Pearl road."}
{"text":"You get what you expect.  Inexpensive but pretty good fast food.  They do have a value menu."}
{"text":"About the same as other locations for food.  Location is not direct on main street and in and out can be congesting.  Drive-thou moves quickly."}
{"text":"There are four fast food restaurants in town and this is by far the dirtiest. Went here this morning and the coffee was cold and the hash browns were a day old."}
{"text":"I love the chicken sandwich there, but everytime I get it's very dry and when you go thru the drive thru they are extremely slow."}
{"text":"I love you, Burger King. Fast food and I have a love-hate relationship. However, today, Burger is the love of my life because I could feed my children on the fly. After chowing down on a lunch date with hubby and daughter number two, I was stumped on what to feed son and daughter number one plus boyfriend. Burger King to the rescue. Driving on our way home, we picked up 3 orders of $1.49 for 10 nuggets with barbecue, ranch and honey mustard sauces plus 2 hamburgers with only ketchup. Our grand bill of $7 plus change. Thanks for being there for me, Burger King. Love, Kemlyn."}
{"text":"Bungle King!! C'mon people, you're not even trying.  Last 2 times we went they messed up our order multiple times each! There's too many goof ups too even remember, if we weren't all over them it'd been worse!Plus my wife orders no-meat Whopper w/ extra veggies & it was absurd - more like no veggies."}
{"text":"If I could give Burger King no stars I would. I used to love BK but they are skimping so bad now on the quality of there food it tastes like complete crap. I used to stop here on the way home from work and have a double whopper and frys. I really looked forward to it but not anymore. There food went from juicy and good to dried out garbage. I kept going thinking maybe it was just a fluke but it wasnt. It never got back to being what it used to be. Its just disgusting. The flavor has changed, the texture has changed, everything else good has changed. I am done with BK for good. Jack in the Box is always good and you they have a great selection of food. I think I will stick to Jacks from now on."}
{"text":"After ordering my food we sat down and waited for our number to be called. When the the order was ready the girl behind the counter started calling the number. As i started walking up to the counter she rapidly called our number 3 times in a row before i reached the counter. As i was standing there the very rude girl behind the counter turned to the other employees behind her and said out loud ( THIS GUY MUST BE HARD OF HEARING ) in a very rude matter. This girl is nothing but a punk and should be put in the back to flip burgers or wash dishes."}
{"text":"Terrible location! The employees that work there are rude, and do not have any common courtesy when handling your food! Went through the drive thru at 6:30 pm, not anywhere near closing time, and was treated terrible by one particular employee. When he handed me a soft drink which I had not ordered, I kindly told him I had not ordered a Coke, but a vanilla shake. Instead of apologizing or going to remake the drink, he simply said \"I heard Coke.\" Then he proceeded to rip the drink from my hands, throw it in the garbage, and rush to make my shake. When he came back, he handed me the shake. As I went to thank him, he slammed the door on my face. Absolutely terrible customer service! I will not be returning! Management needs a better look into who they are hiring.  Update: just got home to find they had forgotten my extra fries, and the cheese on my burger. I even called and they had nothing to say. TERRIBLE LOCATION AND SERVICE. Working at a Burger King is not that hard!!!!!"}
{"text":"This BK should have no stars! Several months ago they served me a raw chicken sandwich (drive-thru). Management never responded to the picture I emailed. Irresponsible and downright horrifying!"}
{"text":"Fast food in general isn't good or healthy for you at all. I'm sure folks turn to fast food just for the fact that it's fast and easy to get something when you're on the go, but I would honestly drink a gallon of water before I scarf down fast food. But when I don't have that gallon of water handy, I succumb to the temptation :/  I'm a Whopper fan. I don't what's in it that draws me to it, but I like it. I don't know if folks remember the Rodeo Burger, but I took a liking to that too. And then, the inevitable happens to the not-so-popular burger ideas-- they kick the can and disappear from the menu. I like the Chicken Sandwich also. NO MAYO! I like how they decided to not charge you extra when you want onion rings instead of fries.  This Burger King is open early and I snagged breakfast before heading off to work a few times. Try the Sausage Biscuit (Do not call them McAnything. They hate that! Hahaha!) with strawberry jam on it! Taste like a sweet hearty grease ball! :P  I'll come back when I feel like a cheat day or something. Or feeling lazy to get anything better."}
{"text":"Meh. It's Burger King. The kids think the hanging airplane in the middle of the restaurant is cool."}
{"text":"How does it happen that Burger King is out of nuggets? I mean let's be real - fast food - burgers fries and nuggets - that's your schtick.  It's your go to especially for screaming toddlers so imagine our shock when told we are out of nuggets...out.of.nuggets.  Who does the ordering? And I mean isn't that tracked by some inventory control? What happens tomorrow out of cheese, fries or gasp \"burgers\" themselves..."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through and their service was cordial and professional. The burger was exactly as I order - I just waited a little longer for my food than I expected I would have to wait. No real complaints here though!"}
{"text":"Rushed through order at drive-thru. Total told to me before I'm even done ordering. Said please and thank you at window to pay and get no response as if I'm being rushed or wasting this employee's time. Will drive across town from now on to eat at Burger King."}
{"text":"My daughter bought a chicken sandwich yesterday and it was soaking and soggy.  Like it was dipped in grease.  When she went to return my daughter was told it was fresh!   My wife had to go in and argue with the manager that a soaked bun is NOT fresh.  Horrible service and food.  Be careful if you buy something there.  Store is going down hill."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is the right Burger King, but if it is across from gate e28, just keep walking.  Food takes a while and definitely don't tell them there's no ice.  You will be ignored."}
{"text":"About 95% of the time going through the drivethru, this location will have you pull around and wait next to the door. I now have to ask if there is a wait time when it comes to paying for my food before hand. I do not want to pay for my food and then you tell me that there is going to be a way to pull around if I don't have time to wait, I certainly don't want to be sitting around trying to get a refund or pick something else."}
{"text":"I purchased 2 Chicken Parmesans, and went home, apx .5 mi from store. I added a liberal amount of refrigerator ketchup, my wife a ranch from the store. About 1/3 in I realized it was raw, not a little pink but mostly. I went back to the store and spoke with manager Armando and showed him the sandwich. He said he would make two more and disappeared, no apology, nothing. Another worker dealt with us and was courteous but again not even an apology"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of this Burger King Location. Donna (the General Manager) And her people are always super friendly and prompt. The Restraunt is always clean, and the food is exactly what one could and should expect from Burger King"}
{"text":"Really great experience... on the occasion that I was in the restaurant was busy but the line moved fast and the service was fast."}
{"text":"After roaming the airport for a decent breakfast sandwich, I finally found the fast food comfort of Burger King. Typical airport protocol had then prepare numerous breakfasts items and place them out for quick service. Made me a little bummed. But it was still warm and pretty good. Thanks airport Burger King."}
{"text":"My office is right off of vía de Ventura and the 101 so I've been coming to this Burger King for a good 4-5 years. Without a doubt 2/3 times i have an issue here, but it's the only fast food place with a veggie burger! Although one time i did come in with a co worker and we did order 2 veggie burgers where they gave us lettuce tomatoes and onions in a bun ?. Manager is horrible, customer service is only good from the lady who takes orders (you're a rockstar btw). They charge for their ranches .... never had that happen at any other Burger King.... and the other closest one is on thunderbird and Scottsdale road? So sad."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and each time it feels like they are rushing to make my order because of how sloppy the food is put together. Food always tastes alright but it looks like a child made it. Always too much mustard or burnt bacon or even half the cheese is falling off of the bun. Very poor food service."}
{"text":"So yummy! Went through the drive-thru so not sure how clean the establishment was on the inside but was very well maintained on the out. No trash thrown anywhere around. The food was delicious as always. The service was fast and friendly. The only complaint I have, is the same complaint I have with all other fast food, the fries need a little more salt and they get cold too fast so by the time I get home, my fries are cold and the salt does no good as it doesn't stick to anything."}
{"text":"I went in hurr and i was like, i am going ti get myself some nuggets. Ya girl gotta have nuggets and fries. The service was slow because there be a lotta people. The lady gave asked me what kinda sauce i wanted and i say \"sweet & sour\" snd she say \"k\". So i went in mah car and i ate. And i say that the nuggets were soggy and bland , the sauce tastes bad and the fries were nashty because they were also soggy and bland."}
{"text":"I hate leaving reviews because I dont want to be annoying like the baby boomers, but I have come to this Bk so many times in the AM for my coffee and pancakes. I have given this location so many chances but it's just so irritating. These people DO NOT know how to make a coffee. Everytime I go, my coffee is not even coffee, its just plain coffee creamer. I spend my money here for a reason and it's just not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"Tried to get breakfast when they opened at 7 but they still said they won't be ready for 10-15 min. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Went to this location ..  they have a dual drive thru like a lot of modern fast food locations.. they skipped me for 5 other cars,  it's almost as if they didn't know I was there. Anyways I ordered something really simple.. Chicken Jr. only Lettuce, Tomato and onion .. it took them 3 times to correct.  Location just doesn't seem organized. Sad because it just opened not too long ago."}
{"text":"My brother ordered from taco time next door, got his food, ate All his food, and then waited 10 more minutes to get my chicken tenders. Worst service ever. Almost 30 min for \"fast\" food."}
{"text":"Come on now what do you want me to say in regards to burger king.  I will keep it plain and simple is a place where I come to get a quick bite to eat when im hungry that is all lol.  I approve this message"}
{"text":"Sorry but this place use to be great but ghetto people started working there now my orders are messed up and they always have some hood attitudes... if you want good ratings then fire that crew!! Asap!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! Every time I come here their soda machine is empty of most of the flavors. And no ice tonight. Their service is poor and I've never seen them flame broiling burgers..... So after waiting 20 minutes and still didn't have our burgers, I asked for my money back. The kid at the register went back to I guess the manager and told her a guy wants his money back. I hear her say \"I don't have time for that!\" The kid gets the override card from her and proceeds to try and figure out how to return my money. My bill was $20.09 and the kid hands me a $20 bill and closes the drawer. I let him know it was $20.09 and he starts going through the refund process again.  Frustrated I tell him never mind and leave. 25 minutes total time spent and I left losing $.09 and didn't get dinner.  This is the worst Burger King. I'll never be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Nothing is ever good here. While I don't frequent BK, I wonder why I stop that 1 time each year. Cold hamburgers made up sloppy and over salted cold fries have been the norm here.   Unfortunately, even with the renovation, it's just not worth the stop."}
{"text":"Edited 3/26/18: I originally said the food was good here yet the inside of the restaurant was disgusting. Let me amend that as of today and another visit by saying the food has reached the distinction of being terrible to my taste buds as well. This place will be lucky to exist next year if it doesn't get shut down this year. It seriously needs an entirely new crew to come in and rescue it.  I live less than a mile for this location and was thrilled when I heard last year that we were getting a new Burger King so close. Ironically, it's right across the street where the former Burger King (now Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe) was. For the first couple of weeks that it was open, it was impossible to get near. The drive-thru lanes were always backed up and the rest of the traffic for the restaurant literally went into main road. I know, it's Burger King. Not worth that much fuss.  Yesterday (1/6/18) was my first visit. I went through the drive-thru and apart from them putting onions on my Whopper when I asked them not to, the order was fine and the burger and fries were as good as any other BK I've visited. So far, so good.  However, I returned today (1/7/18) and went inside at 2:41 PM. The place was an absolute disaster. It's a smaller location, so there's not as much room as all the other BKs I've been to. But there was one cashier with a line of people already five or six deep, an unruly manager yelling at the crew constantly, and all the other staff just seemingly confused, not listening, or not bothered enough to do their jobs.  Orders in front of mine were filled wrong multiple times. The cashier kept punching in orders incorrectly and had to be corrected by the customers. The manager was too busy yelling at everyone and getting in a hurry that he wasn't even paying attention to what was going on and just throwing orders out to the counter, one of which wasn't even completely filled. He wound up bagging mine as a take out order even though it clearly stated that it was for dine in.   It shouldn't have been that unruly. It was a regular after lunch crowd on a Sunday with nowhere near a crazy drive-thru line. Once I finally got my order, I went back and sat down all the way in the back of the dining room because it was literally one of the few tables that was clean. 95% of the other tables had sticky stuff on them, or hadn't been wiped down in general. There was one table that had a cup on it that whole time I was there and remained there when I left. Whomever's it was had left long before I arrived.  The floor near me had a huge half wet-half dried soda spill on the floor under the table. The walls were filthy with black, brown, and white smudges. The men's bathroom had a leftover ketchup cup on the soap dispenser, white streaked residue on the walls, a dirty floor and a urinal with old toilet paper in it. To top it off there are two already broken stools in the dining area.  THIS PLACE HASN'T EVEN BEEN OPEN A MONTH.  Pics are included of all the offenses. The kitchen was no better, with knocked over bun trays near the back, with bun halves and other debris on the floor, along with some brooms. I wasn't able to get a picture of that, but you can see how the front end cup service next to the soda fountain looked.  It's a shame. This place is brand new and already neglected. The staff are obviously not trained well and not trained enough. The manager on duty needed to learn to catch his breath and not create more confusion and getting orders wrong on top of orders that were already wrong. Until this place gets its act together, I won't be going back in. They had a full staff and not one crew member was even looking to clean up the place. It wasn't that busy that this should have happened."}
{"text":"Horrible service  At 5pm the cashier was mopping the front floor with smelly dirty mop water. I stood at the front counter where cash register was waiting to order the employee continues to mop up to and around a circle of my feet.  Wet floors at dinner time that smelled horrible.  Then as I placed my order one of the cooks burned some food and I thought just leave.  Omg when only the manager could validate my coupon he told me \"I got ya don't worry\". I thought what is he talking about?? Sick.  Overall a terrible meal. Go to any other burger joint!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fast food eater and I'm not a big fan of Burger King because I worked there during my senior year in high school.  I have to give this location 3 stars because of the following:   The food is cooked and made to order.  It's fresh! !!  Fresh food at a fast food restaurant is like an urban legend these days but I've visited this establishment twice and each time my order was made to order."}
{"text":"This place wasn't too busy during lunch hours today. Came in for some onion rings & a drink. The onion rings were good, basically the same as every other location.  Things i liked about this place: 1. Clean dining area & restrooms  2. Manager was on it(He needed better staff though) 3. Parking is plentiful  Things that need work: 1. Staff training  2. Wi-fi (I've experienced faster on 4g)  Have it your way or not."}
{"text":"Wow been eating here since opening never had service like today. Waited in line for at least 5 mins while the passenger in the car in front of me jumped out and started hugging one of the employees. After about 10 I started to backing out then the same guy must have circled around me and was telling someone on his cell that I was BACKING OUT!  I wished someone would have been that concerned while I was waiting!!"}
{"text":"We went to this Burger King for supper on Saturday night before we went grocery shopping... My husband ordered the new bacon cheddar stuffed burger meal and I ordered a whopper with cheese. We also ordered a 10pc chicken nuggets.  My husbands burger was sooo burned it was actually black!! and much smaller than the bun was.  The chicken nuggets had obviously been sitting for quite some time..they were shriveled up and dried out looking and they tasted quite nasty!! We had them at a different BK a couple of weeks ago and they were hot and fresh and very tasty there when they were fresh!!! These ones were awful!!!   We thru them out!! At one point as we were eating, my husband told me to look towards the kitchen area, so I did... What we assumed to be the manager, was standing by the fryer, picking his nose!!!!!  This is not something you want to see right after your food just came from there!!  They had some kind of Jazz music playing that was not relaxing or enjoyable... after my husband took the three what was suppose to be onion rings off of his very burned burger, he tried to eat it but could not finish it, it just wasn't edible... the onion rings were either very old and hard or fried waaaaay too long because he could not even bite into them... This meal was just not a good experience at all... I don't think we will be going back to this BK!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband went through the drive thru the other night to pick us up a late dinner. Might I add that I have not eaten at Burger King in years because I have always had bad experiences and believe they don't have good tasting fast food. I decided to give them one more chance after seeing the commercial for the new sourdough king! I was like well that looks tasty and I have always liked jack in the boxes sourdough Jack so maybe this will pleasantly surprise my tastebuds... it DIDN'T. Instead what I got was old meat, a poorly toasted sourdough bun, and some funky tasting cheese sauce with old white onions... I couldn't even bring myself to finish more than half of it. It was awful. I will continue abstaining from Burger King."}
{"text":"Because I'm sure people only write on here when service is bad... I'm writing to say I really enjoyed the food. I had a long day & just wanted a quick bite with my nephew, so we dined in & filled up! I will say this, don't get the whopperito unless you like spice, I expected more of a burger then burrito"}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time in several years. The service was OK. The fries were incredibly salty and both of the ice dispensers were empty. The ketchup seemed watery. During the 15 minutes that I was there, (from about 11:45 to 12:00) , there was only one other customer."}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the first time in several years. It has been completely remodeled since my last visit. Service was quick. I ordered the new chicken parmesan sandwich as a meal. The price was right in line with comparable meals available elsewhere. While it could have been better I did get the occasional bite that definitely reminded me of chicken parmesan. The fries were a bit too salty but were served warm and overall are a bit above average for the industry."}
{"text":"I haven't had Burger King in 2 yrs and today I wanted some, I can't find my receipt to shot out the girl who took care of me in drive thru but I went in around 3pm and ordered 2 whopper Jrs no mayo and a small fry, even thou she forgot my fry n I had to go back around she didn't give me an attitude once so ever, apologized and gave me fresh fries, perfect amount of salt today everything was just great! And I was so sure my day would have been ruined by coming here but to my surprise it was perfect lol I even told my friend God must have made my meal lol!!!! But I'm definitely glad I stopped in today."}
{"text":"Thiswas the second  restaurant that I have Been to tonight and I'm having an issue.  with my order NOW my Nuggets Are Burnt Just Sad |"}
{"text":"So I didn't know when I walked in That not only was I paying for cold food but I was also paying for a cheep knock off of Ghetto fight! As I was walking to a place to sit while I was going to consume my cold meal, I witnessed a young woman haul off and punch a man sitting next to her. He was caught texting another girl in front of her (it's not eavesdropping if she is screaming it) she continued to hit him and sling chairs around. The whole time a manager sat eating subway with his wife, even his wife said he should have shut the shit down. While I fished my meal in what I guess you could describe as unique ambiance every car that went through the drive through had to have there food brought out to them. I guess the manager was once again too busy with his sub to bother. Than to top it all of cause really this place can't get any better there was gum all over my seat. I guess the boxing match must have distracted me. And through all this someone was sleeping through everything in the high top booth across from me. I'm not saying this place sucks but...."}
{"text":"Not closed but ungodly slow. Skip this one. It would be faster to drive to a different one."}
{"text":"I wish i could give ZERO stars. I came thru the drive thru this morning and ordered (2 for $4) Two Sausage Egg and Cheese Biscuits and a medium hash brown. Got on the road and opened the bag to see two biscuits with cold, old, rubbery sausage patties. Called and told the manager the issue. She told me to come back and they would replace my order.  Since i haven't eaten all day, i came back and asked if they could just change the order and i would pay the difference.  The night manager told me my sandwiches were $3 credit.  Not to split hairs, but i told her- \"the two breakfast sandwiches were 2 for $4\" she shrugged her shoulders and said,  \"I never work mornings\" So i ordered two chicken sandwiches (2 for $6) and a medium fry and the total came out to $4 and change. I  Checked my bag, no fries, checked the receipt and she didn't even ring them up. HOW THE FUCK DID THAT HAPPEN?! Maybe next time I'll text them my order. Maybe they could get it right.  Very upset. Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the importance of good service. This location of Burger King is so sorely lacking in this aspect. If it was just once then I would just dismiss it as a one off bad day, but my last visit was just the final straw.   Among the things that have happened are missing items, wrong size, overcharged, and getting the wrong customization of my food order.  On my last visit I asked for a burger with no tomato, and what do I find when I get home but a burger with NOTHING on it except two ugly tomatoes. It was also smashed like a pancake and did not taste fresh and the fries were cold.  So I resolved that I just will not ever go back there. I don't think as a consumer I should pay for bad service and a bad product, so I will go out of my way to go somewhere else rather than come here ever again."}
{"text":"Last night I was driving home at approximately 1:30 AM- being tired, hungry and having just had a confusing conversation with a girl (but hey, what conversation with a girl isn't confusing), so clearly my judgement was a little clouded.  But I decided to stop in to put $1.50 of my hard-earned skrilla to good use to the tune of 10 chicken nuggets with some bbq sauce.  When I arrived home, I threw on The Amazing Race Season 5 and resumed watching where I had left off while double (hell sometimes even TRIPLE) dipping my nuggs in the aforementioned sauce.  All was well.  Or so I thought...  I then woke up disoriented on the couch about 6 AM, feeling like my stomach had suddenly reached the furthermost depths of pain and discomfort.  I felt sick.  I was sure I was food-poisoned.  All I could taste was the nugget remnants mixed with the taste of the vomit I was sure I was about to spew everywhere.  Although I stayed by the toilet feeling miserable for over half an hour, I somehow made a miraculous recovery and avoided puking and was able to fall back asleep.  It was like a sign from God; a warning.  No more BK.  So next time you get the craving to \"have it your way\"- unless \"your way\" is lying on a bathroom floor at 6 AM with your head on the toilet asking the good Lord to just take you, remember this tale and heed my warning.  It's never worth it."}
{"text":"Get price gouged for one thing. Receive something completely different... and of lesser value of course. Just tried to grab a quick bite before my flight, was charged $16 for a sandwich, only to get back to my gate to see they didn't put ANYTHING on the sandwich that was supposed to be there. Good work. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since it's close to my job. It's a typical fast food place. The food is OK but the service is awful. Doesn't seem like anyone here likes their job. Most of the employees here have attitudes and it shows.. I continue to go here only because they don't mess up my order that often and I don't really expect much from Burger King anyway."}
{"text":"Great new staff.  Really turning this place around.  Friendly and consistent!  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Went to the drive-through at 5:00 a.m. for breakfast. The manager proceeded to educate me on why it was important for his staff not to sell breakfast before 530. He can't get breakfast ready by 5:00 a.m. Therefore they are doing the wrong thing. It sounds to me as though he is the incompetent one and cannot keep up with his staff. 5:00 a.m. is definitely breakfast time.  how rude."}
{"text":"This is the worst BK in the valley. Seriously, drive two miles over to go to the Charleston/215 one or the Town Center/Summerlin Parkway location.   I went to this location 4 times before giving up and driving farther. Cold fries (that you wait 10 minutes for), wrong items (twice we received either two Cokes or two Diet Cokes when we order one of each), items incorrectly made, missing items, and what was best, was when they didn't even know what went into the Family Meal when it was out for a limited time. The cashier did not believe me when I said it was supposed to come with a toy, nor did the other cashier, until they finally got a manager out of t he back who laughed and said she guesses she better train out on the new menu item.   Drive the extra 5 minutes, you'll make it up in speed of service and not having to go back to get it fixed."}
{"text":"Well, my order was wrong...but what I received was pretty darn tasty, so I can't complain too much. Fries were hot, and so was my sandwich.  That's about all I can ask for in a BK."}
{"text":"The guy his name is haizy idiot! He forgot his brain somewhere. Who let you work in restaurant???? Go to clean restrooms in Harlem such a trash!!!!  Ben shel zona sharmuta!!!!"}
{"text":"Slowest Burger King in the city. People that work there seem a bit \"special\" if you get my meaning. I ordered three items and the cashier got stumped. The two groups of people who ordered before me all looked settled in for a good min. The cashier and his co-worker began to tease and play with one another to the point of where it felt uncomfortable for me and frustrating as well because I had to repeat the same three items twice while dude laughed and hollered \"Stop PLAYING, girl...\" Food was freshly made tho. Though one item tasted a little suspect. Finger nail polishy."}
{"text":"Sometimes they get it right most The Times They don't but it's fast food and its Burger King your expectations shouldn't be too high. But when you're in the mood for fast food Burger King is okay just wish they can get the order right more often."}
{"text":"I'm just trying to eat and you guys were very rude and also you messed up my order which we had to repeat to you twice!"}
{"text":"After a night out on the town, Ubered to the only place still open, the BK Lounge.  My squished cadaver of a Whopper sapped the warmth from my tastebuds, while my twice cremated fries hardened into potato diamonds right before my eyes... If the food tastes that bad when it's Uber o'clock, you know someone effed up royally.   Definitely didn't get it my way. Definitely don't recommend. Definitely not going back.   You should probably do the same."}
{"text":"Please check your order before you leave the driver through window. You may well find they have charged you for warmed over garbage. When I called to complain the staff was playing the \"I can't hear you\" game. Called the \"franchise\" number given and they demonstrated indifference to the concerns of food quality. This is a outright scrub organization."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, when you come in they tell you what they do not have. Very efficient on low inventory of supplies, they don't have them. Nice play ground and it is not crowded. Pancakes were terrible!"}
{"text":"It's a good business and does well. Though this is newer building, it looks much older, which gives it a bit more appeal to older customers. As for, I've always had a fine experience. Very few issues, if any. The staff works hard, though you may roll your eyes at these kinds of people- and I wouldn't blame ya. It's location is great and is easy to reach. If you don't wanna travel too far, this BK might just be up your ally. Also, avoid the teens- they swarm this place like bees. Just a warning for potential readers."}
{"text":"Went in tonight. Tried to order a large plain iced coffee (among other things). She asked me if I wanted the coffee with mocha or vanilla flavoring. I told her that I wanted it plain. She told me that wasn't an option. I pointed right up to the big menu on the wall that listed plain-mocha-vanilla under the iced coffee, and she just looked at me like I was stupid. Then another worker came over and told me that she didn't know why it says that. Then she said that it must be a mistake. But they both insisted that there was no such thing as plain iced coffee, even though it's clearly posted right there on the menu. It was really bizarre, I took my upset 3 year old and went across the street to McDonalds. It wasn't that serious, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We come here once in a while, mostly because they're open 24 hours and have a drive through. Every visit is always seasoned with greasy, salty shame.  The drive through runs quickly enough, particularly at 3am. We came inside ONCE to take advantage of the cheap chicken nuggets deal. The burgers and fries are quite good, by fast food standards. The chicken nuggets are just awful. They are exactly like the kind you can get in 5 pound, unmarked plastic bags at Costco, and rather than cooking them in the oven like a normal human being, you microwave them so they are soggy and tasteless.   This location also has that neat coke machine that lets you make a variety of pops. It's pretty neat. The restaurant itself is clean with a good variety of tables, booths and individual seats."}
{"text":"Give me a minute to read the menu. No one behind me. Never been here for breakfast and she wouldn't give my twelve year old a chance to read the menu. If I wasn't needed somewhere within a short time I would have left. Relax a bit lady!"}
{"text":"They can make a good sandwich.  The service is ok.  I like the new menu.  They have wifi but it doesn't work.  You can charge your laptop there tho.  If urban sounds are your flavor, you'll enjoy the loud music, but unfort for me, it's not my bag."}
{"text":"Just your average, typical Burger King. I would say the service is mediocre- nothing to rave about, but not necessarily rude. milkshakes are great, and the burgers and chicken nuggets are just as good. But on one negative, they forgot to ask my friend if she wanted whipped cream, but remembered to ask me. She was disappointed because she really enjoys their whipped cream, so in my opinion the stuff should be more knowledgable with the questions they are supposed to ask. But besides that abandoned whipped cream, it's a cheap and good place for good!"}
{"text":"Worst service. Guy at the drive through window asked my husband to go forward and back up the vehicle to which my husband complied, and they laughed! Very unprofessional. Very unprofessional. Never going back to this Burger King store ever. Beware the night shift people here. They're crazy."}
{"text":"Out of the major fast-food restaurants, Burger King is my preferred breakfast spot.  The main reason I prefer Burger King over say McDonald's or Bojangles, is the Croissandwich.  I am not a biscuit guy, as I find them usually too dry and they tend to dry out my mouth and throat.   I also like their style of hash browns as opposed to the one, big hash brown you get from McDonald's.  Another hidden gem on the Burger King Breakfast menu is the French Toast Sticks which are always hot and great with syrup (i find I need two syrups).   Since this is the closest Burger King to me, I often go here for breakfast, I usually go through the drive-thru and my order is USUALLY correct.  However, I must say, that to my extreme disappointment, my order has been incorrect here on more than one occasion.  The main problem is that I order a BACON, egg and cheese Croissandwich and instead I get a SAUSAGE, egg and cheese Croissandwich.  At the end of the day, its not that big of a deal, and I usually end up eating it either way, its just the principal of the matter, than I paid for something I did not order nor want.  Of course, I could return it, but its simply not worth the gas or the effort.  WHY CAN'T THEY JUST GET MY ORDER RIGHT???  Its very disheartening to get home and open the bag only to find something you did not order!!!!  My advice is to check your order before driving off, because though the staff and service are usually good, they WILL MESS UP YOUR ORDER!!!  Otherwise, if you've had Burger King breakfast before, you should be fairly familiar with the menu options and offerings."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service during non peak hours. As we waited for our food, the drive thru attendant informed us there was only one cook and one food prep working. She then asked us to pull around to the front of the building to wait for our food. After about 10 minutes, my husband went in the restaurant to find our food had been sitting on the counter. Irritated, we left; only to find that we had been given the wrong drinks and a wrong side item."}
{"text":"So very rude interrupts you and doesn't even let you finish your sentences. Mumbles there words and acts like an asshole."}
{"text":"this particular location is 24 hrs...I ended leaving bc service took more than 20 mins. This isn't the first time either. Will NEVER go back! Horrible!  BK don't stay open 24 hrs if you can't staff the place properly."}
{"text":"This is the worst location. Always understaffed and the one or two employees who are here are having a contest to see who can move slower..."}
{"text":"It's Burger King, there's not much to say, but this is a nice, clean location. Good service, 24 hours and they have my favorite drink of all time... VAULT soda on tap lol."}
{"text":"VERY displeased with the service. The chicken fries are back, and I was very overjoyed. I was on a STRICT schedule and made sure to get here as early as possible. I ordered two orders of chicken fries with a Hershey pie with sweet and sour sauce. I waited, and I waited some more. My order number was 294 and I started hearing them call numbers after mine, so I went up and asked, \"Yo, where's my food?\" They said somebody else took my order. So I walked around and looked for somebody with my order. NOBODY had it! I went back up and asked for my order. They gave it to me, but with Barbecue sauce! I asked for sweet and sour! Overall 2 out of 10, just because the chicken fries are back."}
{"text":"Sometimes they get it right and most the times they don't. But it's burger king fast food it taste good and cheap."}
{"text":"Best BK ever. Everyone is so friendly and it is the best whopper jr in Cleveland. Everything is fresh"}
{"text":"Food came in quick. The cashier did mess up my dates order. He specifically told her no pickles nor unions 3xs before paying. They did not execute his order right ."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!  I usually don't post reviews about fast food restaurants because they are fast food restaurants, I get that and don't expect much from them but this place is horrible!   I've been there a few times, it's always been slower than other places.  I decided to stop by yesterday afternoon, about 1 pm, they have two drive thru lanes, I pulled into the first one there was one car in front of me and another in the other lane ahead of me.  It took them forever to take the order of the car in lane next to me, then the car in front of me.  I wait, nobody takes my order, I'm speaking into the speaker but no answer.  Then a car pulls up in the lane next to me and they friggin take his order!  I'm pissed off now, and of course there is now a car behind me so I can't back out.  I'm still talking into the speaker but nothing.  Then another car pulls up in the lane next to me and they begin taking her order!!   I get out of my car, walk up to the window and start going off.  I placed my order there but when I got back into my car I decided I probably shouldn't eat there, remembered the movie \"Waiting\", if you haven't seen it, check it out, it will change how you deal with restaurants.  So I get to the window, give them another piece of my mind and leave, they claimed they were having some issue with their \"system\", whatever that means.  Never going there again.  Worst BK ever."}
{"text":"This is literally the worst, slowest most disorganized restaurant ever. You get faster service and better food at any of the competitors in the area.  Never go here."}
{"text":"Brooklyn fast food joints need to get their shit together. (See my McDonald's review on my thrilling experience of getting a half eaten sandwich in my takeout order.) Asked to add mustard to my whopper, came with literally a bite size wilted single square of iceberg lettuce (approximately an inch and a half by an inch and a half) with literally a few drops of mustard and ketchup and mayonnaise directly in the center of my whopper with a tiny tomato slice. Had one decent bite of my whopper once I ate around it and got into the center for said bite. Sad and slightly laughable."}
{"text":"I just went thru the drive thru.  The food is good, and the service is fast.  It is truly fast food.  Which for a fast food restaurant is ironically rare"}
{"text":"Work close by so I come by quite a bit. Siera is what makes this burger king the best one! Her customer service skills are amazing and it is almost shocking that she is not working in a five star restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went there a couple days ago, through the drive-thru.  What a mistake.  The food was stone cold, not even luke warm, it has similarities of food that was frozen and thawed out, that's out cold it was.  The food (chicken nuggets) were unedible, I threw them away, to far to go back and get fresh ones.  I can't believe they would even serve that sort of food to customers.  I will never go back to this location, I'd rather go hungry."}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered the Extra long BBQ Cheeseburger and the Original Chicken Sandwich. Both of them were good andthey satifiyed my hunger."}
{"text":"All I wanted was breakfast. Looked online and saw it opens at 6 AM on weekdays. I get there at 6:15 doors locked. Oh well they're running behind so I go for a walk and come back, still locked. I got fed up and spent double I planned at the Mc Donalds next door. They should close it down at this point. Who ever manages it is not very good."}
{"text":"I guess I have to give it one just to say something.  These employees receive no behind the scenes training and are forced to learn as they go and get admonished in front of customers instead of being helped.  Myra, the supervisor, needs some training herself in customer service! I don't recommend this Burger King to anyone and I might never shop at one again!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru today for a 10 piece nuggets, large fries & 2 cheeseburgers.  I waited 10 minutes for them to serve the car in front of me and over 10 minutes at the window waiting for my order...! I could see in the window and they weren't busy...  The bag with nuggets & fries was sitting there the whole time but the burgers weren't done.  I heard the guy ask for them 3 times...!  How can they call this fast food?  Got home (5 mins away) and the burgers were still warm but the fries & nuggets were cold.  Im only giving them 2 stars because the guy working the window was very polite."}
{"text":"Burger King is Burger King, the food is good, but the difference is service (or lack thereof).  When you go through the drive-through to get food for several, there's not really a practical way to open and check every item for accuracy.  So you drive away and you don't know it's screwed up until you get there.  Most fast food sends you with a receipt with a website you can visit to make a compliment or complaint, but we have no receipt.  So I go on BK's website to report the problem (like you can for EVERY fast food restaurant in the world), but my only option is to make a phone call to FLORIDA (toll call, no 800 number).  Seriously?  Also, and this is important...  If you're at the drive-through and they tell you to \"pull around to the front\" because your order is taking a long time, DO NOT do it.  There is no \"up front,\" there's just the exit and the street.  Most awkward, I blocked the entire world for the 10 minutes it took to get my food.  The 2-stars are because the food that *was* right was pretty yummy."}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday, July 5th around noon. The place and the restrooms were so dirty, I walked out."}
{"text":"Just bought 2 egg breakfast sandwiches, when we got home to eat, our eggs tasted spoiled. Of course threw them out. Then call BK on Boulder Hwy. I just thought it was the right thing to do. (No one gets sick, no one sues). Instead of a \"thank you\", manager called me a liar. Said their good.  I hope your right...."}
{"text":"Rude lady in drive thru my girl ordered to drinks one coke zero and one coke girl tried to give us one coke zero and one diet and when we tried to tell her the right one nicely the drive thru girl got a attitude we are never go back to this location ever again"}
{"text":"All I'm gonna say is I was solicited twice to buy drugs within a 5 minute window. Someone needs to clean up this place."}
{"text":"In my 89103 zip code, this was the highest rated Burger King.  It was a long day at work and all I wanted was a Burger. I had a couple for free satisfries with a purchase of a regular whopper. I was like, DEAL! I'm doing this.   Located in an old stripmall, you can't miss this building. Went through the drive thru and ordered my food. When I paid, the guy just takes my card without acknowledging me. I said, \"thanks.\" I got no response back. I thought he was dead.  My fries were stale! Gross. But other than, the burger was alright. But the service ruined it.Oh well."}
{"text":"This was the worst BK I have ever been too!  I was ignored and the food sat for a long while before the counter person put it on the tray and then had to pack it in a bag because I ordered it to go!  I was so disappointed!"}
{"text":"The rudest people I've ever encountered. I asked for no onions or pickles and the rude assistant manager told me I should've bought the food back in although my husband and daughters picked up the food and were long gone by the time I realized my order was incorrect. So instead of going back I asked if my burger could be replaced and she snatched my receipt and replaced it but had the worst attitude ever!!!!! She shouldn't be in customer service at all."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean,  that's important,  and I appreciate that it is updated and that the play area is also clean for the kids.    I was greeted,  and the people were friendly,  they weren't busy,  and only two of us were in line.  That's important to this review because they got the order wrong.   The kids meal didn't have the food they asked me to decide on even after we decided on applesauce.    They also got the sandwich wrong,  which is odd since all we ordered was bread and cheese.  Nothing else.    I have a burger king north of me,  I'll be going there from now on.  This store is fine. But I don't ask for much,  so when I ask I'd like it to be right.    Especially when they put it on the receipt correctly as I ordered it,  and still got it wrong.   Oh well."}
{"text":"My fiancé went here and ordered two burgers plain and they gave him two burgers with everything on them. I don't understand how hard it is to make two burgers without any condiments. It's less work for you if someone orders something plain so pay attention and just do your job. It's not that hard."}
{"text":"Sour dough king not toasted and gave us the c heel. No ketchup for  it fries. Ice tea with like ice. On a 103 degree day. Fries not fresh. All 4 orders barely warm"}
{"text":"Some mornings, I just can't pass up on a $3.99 value breakfast just to save the 8% PST or a whole $0.32 more in my pocket!  With a coupon, I ordered the double Croissan'wich sandwich which has bacon, egg & processed cheese.  Deal included small hash browns and a small coffee.  I don't want to know the total breakfast calorie count but the sandwich is already 480 and the art of the deal is the focus.  Service was very good and this location is clean and quiet at this time of day.  Off to a good start with my morning meal for $4.20 total!"}
{"text":"I have coupon for a junior whopper, medium fries, and a medium fountain drink (free refills) for $3.99.  Service was very quick and I was seated eating my meal within 8 minutes.  This is a busy location and lots of free parking.  It has a seating area for about 80 people with quiet top 40 music playing.  My food was hot and freshly prepared.  A quick light meal while I'm out and about."}
{"text":"It's Burger King. You come here out of necessity, not by choice. Good quick service though."}
{"text":"Today while in getting lunch around 330 the employees of the store chased off a homeless man for trying to get a drink. From what I understand denying an individual water in Arizona is against the law. I am considering calling corporate headquarters and bringing this to their attention.   Seeing your employees corner the individual and using harsh tones with the person isn't called for, he is already down on his luck and doesn't need someone yelling at him for a $2.50 drink. I'm pretty sure your employees have been in his shoes at one point wondering where their next meal will come from.   I'm pretty sure the late/closing crew takes all that pre made food home to their families."}
{"text":"We just arrived in Fountain Hills, after a long days drive of 11 hours.  Naturally, we were starving, and needed something quick and filling to eat.  This Burger King is very dumpy, and looks like it needs an upgrade.  The guy who waited on me was very sullen, and didn't seem to care that customers pay his salary and keep the economy moving.  He just pushed the bag of food at me, and grunted \"here you go\" like I was a horse, or dog.  Anyways, at least the food was hot, otherwise, they would lose a star."}
{"text":"Love coming here after work with my coupon deals, when you guys mail me. now I have there app just incase I don't have a coupon on me. I always get my food hot and fresh. Manger is always nice to me. They never mess out my order. Every time I come in, they remember there regular customers name and Order. That's Service right there!!! When your sitting down they would check on you if everything is ok or do you need catch up or other condiments.... I felt like I was dining in and a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Had to come in, cause they re-model the whole place ...I also used my app for coupon. Food came out fast ... The whole place looks clean"}
{"text":"I was trying to bring up my app from Burger King and it was thinking really slow, but the girl who was taking my order took care of my order. That was trying to get on my app. When I got my good it was fast service"}
{"text":"I should have left when I walked in the door and the employees were playing catch with something by the grill. About an hour after I ate a burger I got really sick. This happened on July 3rd about 1:30 pm."}
{"text":"Listen...its the little things that matter.  When going through a drive thru you EXPECT napkins and at least ketchup. Nothing and the chicken was sitting there for a while and a little hard.  Get it together guys. You just lost a customer."}
{"text":"Amazing service from the gentleman with the pony tail.  We always prefer to bring our business to this Burger King because of him. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Terrible service worst customer service and food service they don't even take orders right you ask for a kids meal and they don't even ask what to drink it's not worth even going to They don't even have toys for kids meals it's just toddler ones"}
{"text":"I got caught in the drive through lane for 13 minutes today waiting for my food.      There's no way out of he lane after entering, or I would have gone somewhere else that cares about customer wait time."}
{"text":"Loved my bacon whopper. Nice and fresh. Well prepared. I wish the fries were a bit more fresh though. They tasted a bit old. I ordered a Dr Pepper and I'm pretty sure I got a root beer. The place could be a bit cleaner. The bathroom needed more paper towels and toilet paper when I was there."}
{"text":"This is a Burger King that you will not find on the Burger King web site. No idea why since it has been here for maybe a year.   Well anyway I was driving back from a listing and for some reason pulled in here, I am not one to patronize Burger King, but I did.  I ordered the Steak House Burger combo. They were very quick in getting this out the drive through window. Oh and yes the window person was polite.  The burger is an odd looking thing, very flat and wide, larger than the bun oh and also quite thin. It is piled high with fried onions, lettus, tomato, sauce and cheese. It has a decent taste but for some reason it felt as if I were eating a mutant burger. The fries were fine I guess. I am not much for fries so not an expert.  For me this burger is too much food, a good one to share. Hmm why do I order a combo if do not like fries, I will have to remember not too next time."}
{"text":"Ugh. I feel bad having to pan a Burger King, I mean I should have known better.   The cashier up sold me for cheese on my chicken sandwich, which when I checked my receipt was $1.69!! Hey guess what- that cheese costs about $0.03 a slice!   And then the cheese wasn't there when I opened the damn sandwich!   The disinterested and confused cashier handed it over to someone in the kitchen who put the cheese under my pile of wet lettuce and nuked it.   The onion rings were old and lukewarm.   I know Burger King isn't haute cuisine, but every one around here has been phoning it in for a while. Yuck. Get it together Burger King!"}
{"text":"Absolutely no customer service. Stood at the register for 15 min. . The rude worker asked if I wanted a glass of water. I left"}
{"text":"But they are improving and the rodeo burger is back. Even with that though it is still the worst fast food around."}
{"text":"The coke machine was out.  The people at the counter are so unorganized.  I had to go to counter to get a refill neither one of the guys would make any eye contact and I finally after 5 mins sat there I said excuse me can I get a refill on diet coke.  Before going in the resturaunt I sat in my car for 5 mins.  I finally went inside there had been a car with 2 people sitting in it because drive thru had them park until food was ready.  I went in ordered with my husband and 2 grandkids food ate it when I went up to get refill the people in the red car were just getting their food.  How does this burger King stay in business.  I've been in food service as a manager.  And this kind of service would have never happened."}
{"text":"Just proving I'm not a foodie snob ;) well it's cheap, effective and comes with free packets of ketchup. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I typically won't bother reviewing a mass chain since most would generally know what to expect. That said, I feel I should give this location an honourable mention since it's very well run. Customer service is always friendly and timely, and the place is always clean. Most importantly the food is fresh and prepared as close as you'd find in the advertising. No  excessive mayo, or having half a salad fall out of your burger wrapper, or whatever else you may expect half the time at other locations. That they've been consistent is where the real credit is due. Having worked at BK half a lifetime ago, i'd know from experience, and this place is better than my location ever was."}
{"text":"Ordered a Whopper meal and she tells me they are out of Whoppers. Uhhhhh, whoever does your ordering needs to be fired. How do you run out of your staple item?!?!?! She offered me a chicken sandwhich. I had to make sure i wasnt at chick-fil-a. Lol. We left..."}
{"text":"I love Burger King (even though I probably shouldn't because it's not healthy) but when I recently went through the drive thru I had to wait almost 30 minutes. When I got to the window the cashier was extremely nice and apologetic which I appreciated. He explained that they were short staffed which made the wait understandable. But after he stepped away another worker came to the window to give me my food and I almost didn't take it. I feel terrible saying this but instead of wearing a uniform he was wearing a stained sweater and looked very unkept. He also got my order wrong and when I asked him to switch it he did so without using gloves. So I ended up not eating what I ordered. I imagine this was someone they had come in last minute because they were short staffed, but I basically lost my appetite because of their unprofessional appearance and behavior. I also think he may have been high, not that I care, but that probably didn't help the situation. Needless to say I won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"This locations service is shockingly bad. The location was dirty and not kept up. You can tell the employees don't care. It is clear the owner of this franchise has given up and there can't be any managers on duty.  There is a reason I saw few customers.  I know I will not be back and will help spread the word."}
{"text":"I think the photo says it all, but Yelp keeps encouraging me to review this business, so here it goes. I wanted ice cream after eating some awesome Venezuelan street food, and it was too late for Luv-It. Burger King's gingerbread sundae sounded good, so I ordered one and an order of the new sweet potato curly fries to try. The gingerbread syrup was too thin, and not as satisfying as the caramel sundae. When I checked the fries before leaving the drive thru, the container was barely half full of sweet potato... nubs? Stumps? Not a curl in sight. My husband showed this to the cashier, who briskly replied, \"yeah, they're supposed to be like that, all chopped up\"... and with that, we drove away."}
{"text":"Brought the kids here to play and enjoy some lunch. There is no changing table in the bathroom which made changing my son's diaper very difficult. It was either put him on the floor or change a very stinky diaper in a booth in front of everyone else. I will probably not come here again just for that reason."}
{"text":"I normally don't have such high expectations when i go to burger king but this is too much. Worst drive thru ever! Employees were loud and smoking cigarettes right in front of the drive thru and their speaker wasn't working, all i could hear while the server was taking my order once they fixed the speaker all i heard was the staff talking and playing around, this place is a joke and the food was bad too."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service and everytime I eat there I get sick. The hotdogs now too? They need to perfect the original menu before adding new items!"}
{"text":"Same food as any other Burger King, but way way overpriced here. Not worth it unless you're super hungry for a $10.99 mediocre burger meal, but still there were crowds of people ordering food. I grabbed an over priced cheeseburger to hold me over until my flight and that was it."}
{"text":"The cashier was high as f*ck today. I mean, they always get the order right, but the people who work here are weird."}
{"text":"It smells really bad I came in to place an order & nobody was at cashier. The place is a mess & the workers are bad at communicating with each other. I love eating Burgerking but this location is bad."}
{"text":"Took my daughter here because it's close to the house and she likes to visit the  pet store located in the same shopping center.   This is a typical Burger King without much to set it apart from others. The kids' play area is fairly small with little seating for the adults, but it's always clean and doesn't get too crowded."}
{"text":"Just ordered 60 chicken nuggets at 2:30am in the morning at the drive-thru. Service was quick and the nuggets were crisp and hot. Overall, pretty good. Not too oily and for $1.99 per 10 piece, it was definitely a solid choice for a late night snack in Markham. Only complaint is that 2/6 of the 10-piece packets were a little too crispy and slightly tougher than the rest. Still a reasonable texture though so I wouldn't mind coming back again."}
{"text":"Yo, everyone knows about BK.....   but this one was a great experience.  I am not sure if the lady behind the counter was a DRILL SGT.  She ran such a tight ship... there was virtually no wait on a busy lunch hour visit and she made everyone laugh.... very impressive....."}
{"text":"I've tried really hard to like this location since it is close to work, but everything about it is just no.  First off, it's BK so the quality of food is not great anyway, but this location tends to be more on the weak side.  Secondly, the staff consistently make errors on orders, wasting food and customers' time when they have to remake something. What's worse is they're usually rude about it. It's like hey you didn't type it into the register correctly, that's not really my fault. They will argue with you and make sure you know you can't have it your way, no matter what their slogan is.  Lastly, they don't honor coupons the correct way. I just went there with a buy-one-get-one-free coupon that blatantly says I would get a free Whopper sandwich of equal or lesser value with the purchase of one. NOWHERE does it say that it excludes special Whoppers like the Angry Whopper, etc. So when I asked if I could get an Angry Whopper and the free one be a regular Whopper, the Hispanic, older (maybe 40s) woman with long, painted nails (describing her so you know to stay away from her - she is referred to as the \"Latina hussie\" in the other post) asked me passive aggressively if I wanted an Angry Whopper and two regular Whoppers.  No, that is EXACTLY why I was asking if I could get that deal because other BKs actually honor the coupon and its ambiguity. I said the coupon didn't specify but she handed me the coupon, roller her eyes like she had something better to do, and said it only applied to REGULAR Whoppers. Okay, so never going back to your sh*thole because other BKs actually take the coupon and apply it to any Whopper, thanks."}
{"text":"Why can't I get cheesy tots instead of fries? It's a side , but I was told no by the rude manager that works most evenings that I've come in. She has short hair, maybe in her late 40's early 50's. She has no business talking to customers and is extremely disrespectful to the employees every time."}
{"text":"Number 15 Burger King Foot Lettuce. The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: \"This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King.\" Admittedly, he had shoes on but that's even worse.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azSYefZhv1s"}
{"text":"Food was fine, what u would expect from Burger King, but the service is sooooooo slow! Every time I go there, it takes forever and I swear I will never go to that location again, and then I find myself there again cursing the same complaints!"}
{"text":"Went here at noon on Sunday. There were 2 cars in the lot and none in drive thru. Not a good omen for getting hot fresh food. And boy was I right. I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich meal and drove about one mile back home. The chicken sandwich was barely warm and the fries were almost stone cold.I would not order another crispy chicken sandwich even though they probably taste much better when hot and fresh. When Chick-fil- A opens @ Sahara and I-15 there won't be any need to order chicken anywhere else. On the plus side the young lady at the drive through window was polite,friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Yep. Screwed up my order, too. Ordered and paid for a triple and got a double. I think they count on you being in a hurry so you don't complain. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I rarely eat major fast food chains, and it's for reasons like this.... my husband were on our way home, and baby was sleeping in the back. I had a craving for a cheeseburger and he wanted ice cream. We stopped here and they had already cleaned and closed the ice cream machines. WHY DO YOU DO THAT BEFORE ITS EVEN TIME TO CLOSE!!! Ugh!!!"}
{"text":"Recently renovated this is my favorite Bk. Love the pub style seating and the large booths that are modern looking. The two big tvs keep me entertained while eating, which means I can enjoy my soccer game while my little one plays in the play area.  Customer service is really good. They are fast and have never made a mistaken on my order.   Love their whopper, Cinnabon bites and the chicken nuggets (which right now are 10 for $1.50)   When crowns are available they give them with the kids meal. Which my daughter likes more than a toy. Princess in the making."}
{"text":"For a Burger King it was pretty good the customer service was great in the drive thru will def come back"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst location!!! I have given them many try's because my kids like chicken fries and breakfast sandwiches.  If i could give it a 1/2 Star i would! DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION! I have never gotten one order correct.  They have items on their menu that they do not serve.  Awful, Awful service! Went through the drive through, paid and was told to pull forward  I was then was told I owed the amount of my change 12.87 for two breakfast sandwiches and a water????. They argued with me that i didn't pay and I did! That was the last straw for me. Never again!"}
{"text":"This place seriously needs to be remodeled.   The seats are torn.  And could use a very cleaning.  Plus there prices are higher than other Burger King restaurants.  Much better to walk across the road and go to In and Out or McDonald's."}
{"text":"Food is always good, and served hot.  Staff does a fine job.  I knocked off a star because their Coke Freestyle machine is out of various flavors too often."}
{"text":"I used to eat here every now and then.  I would wait and wait for my food along with a bunch of other angry customers.  I don't know how the place isn't boarded up by now.  I just don't want to wait for something that is supposed to be called \"fast food.\"  It is ashame because burger king had a good name and reputation at one point.  I would like to have a good one located somewhat close by, but this one is just not good."}
{"text":"Drunk munchies at 4am? I'm not about to throw down some double digit dough on food I'll probably vomit later. Imagine my surprise to literally stumble upon the only Burger King on the strip being called out by a \"little person\" announcing beer pong at O'Shea's. Beer pong was our first thought, but after realizing just how intoxicated we were figured some alcohol absorption was a better bet. Sure it's expensive for a fast food joint, but when you have to have it, cost really isn't an issue. An oasis in an overpriced food market and literally in the middle of the desert, this location gets 4 stars just for being what it is, where it is, when you need it."}
{"text":"Came today for breakfast & it was 10:26am and I wanted a breakfast sandwhich and they said they aren't serving breakfast anymore. Breakfast ends at 10:30 though. Not a great Burger King location or service."}
{"text":"Since the minimum wage increased, my wife and I have been to this location 3 times. All 3 times our order was incorrect. Today, the expensive rodeo king didn't have the onion rings on it. The floor was sticky all around the soda fountain and the front counter. Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Do not stop at this Burger King unless your looking for... No common sense, slow service and a good 25-30 minutes to get your food."}
{"text":"Poor service at this location.  Bummer I actuality like Carl's jr. Drive  thru didn't put in all the hamburgers. Didn't realize it until i got home.  I had to go back mt receipt shows 1236pm i didn't get all my food until 120pm. The manager on duty during this ordeal was sad to say incompetent of handling a simple order."}
{"text":"im not sure why your online site says open until 10pm but consistantly closed at 901pm on a friday night?  i would expect that with the costly remodel your ownership has bills to pay and should be open at least for the hours your web site says.   i think the evening manager closes whenever he or she thinks its \"slow\".    i noticed that mcdonalds up the street has done well with its later hours, as we have to go there when your store is closed at 9pm.  what gives?"}
{"text":"Workers stood around talking instead of helping customers. When I finally got my order it was wrong. Definitely avoid this place."}
{"text":"Ordered a Whopper Combo with Cheese @11:33am, 30 mins later....nothing. So I went up to the counter with my receipt. Seems they were too overwhelmed and lost track of my order. The manager upgraded my order to Large fry instead of a medium."}
{"text":"Closest fast food to us, not a lot out as far as we are, so thought Burger King would be great. Now hubby does not like Burger King but I do, living in Colorado one close to our house I went quite often it was always good, hot food is my priority. Went to have a chicken sandwich recently it was so hot and juicy. So went back and tried the chicken with ham and cheese, oh wow what a disappointment, chicken dried and old, so I don't send anything back but knowing I had a better chicken sandwich there already, I took it up to the counter. The man took one look and said, you are right, this is terrible, I wouldn't eat that so they made me a new one, it was very good but without the amount of ham the first one had. Now I'm wondering why this happened. Do the employees not care what goes out and don't even try very hard. So I say if it's not to your liking give it back and ask for fresh. They lose business if you don't go back, so make the manager aware of what you are getting. The employees don't care apparently, I'm hoping to try the new sourdough burger today, after reading one review not sure that's a good idea. I like the ones at Jack in the Box so have to give this one a try!"}
{"text":"This place is a train wreck. So much disorganization, I felt like I was at an Alzheimer's support group, except, it's mostly kids. Everyone pointing the finger at each other instead of mashing the gas and getting work done. I feel bad for the manager because I can see she's trying but the kids are not helpful whatsoever. Then, to make things worse, there's customers grabbing whatever food they put on the counter. This place is busy but the employees are lazy and rude.   Stay away"}
{"text":"Worse than any other burger King in every way but hey, you gotta eat and it's the cheapest around, relatively speaking *sigh*"}
{"text":"The jerk staff always mess up the order, I asked for spicy chicken and they load it with sweet and sour sauce...I ask for large fries they give me small. Worst most dumbest ppl on earth live in this area....double check ur order...take a bite infront of them to make sure they don't mess with the proper ingrediance....to hell with this BK location I hope they hire less retarded staff who follow direction and don't mess with orders for the fun of it."}
{"text":"Worst BK Ever!! Management doesn't know what kind of food that there staff is serving. My recommendation is Do Not Eat Here At This Location!"}
{"text":"When I fall off the wagon it usually isn't just a morsel of regret.  It's more like, I can't believe I ate the whole thing. Boy, am I going to have to run a few extra miles to make sure I don't have to pull out my fatty pants again.  I succumbed to the power of the coupon.  Not just any coupon, it was like a Golden Ticket from Wonka Land.  Better than a two for one of one of my favorites, Breakfast Croissanwich from Burger King.  Two sandwiches, a coffee and little greasy-golden rounds of hash brown goodness-for only $4.  It's always great to have a coupon like this so I can share with the Princess. Unfortunately, the P was nowhere to be found and I found myself alone with a bag of morning satisfaction which has, on the outside, a ten-minute shelf life.  Waste not, want not.  I ate everything.  It was delicious.  I was extremely satisfied.  I purred like a cat on farm land filled with field mice . Regret, yeah, so much for self-control-check my Strava page to see my penance- (or the notch on my belt I'm no longer using).  Seriously, the reason for the review was the excellent service I received at the drive-though.  Courteous, prompt, and friendly.  But the thing that got my attention was when I asked for cream and sugar for my coffee, they offered to do it for me.  Most fast food places will simply give you the sugar packets and cream and you can do the doctoring yourself, which is fine with me.  However, this little nicety really made my day, saved me a minute in the parking lot and got me back on the road to work.  I know a Burger King review might seem a little low brow but great service and quality food when you're on the way to work is super way to start the day.  Well done BK."}
{"text":"I normally stay away from fast food lunches if I can help it, but I had a coupon for a free sandwich, so I thought I'd indulge.  Nope, not this one. The guy at the counter says the code on my coupon was not the right one, like I had gotten the bonus question wrong on the big test. I wrote down the code I was given. He was very unclear on the specifics. It was like he just didn't want to honor it. He said they do honor them, but the code I had didn't have the date. The date was on the front. He then said it was the wrong code. OK, I'm in the wrong place, see ya!  This BK is always smelly and there always transients loitering and smoking just outside anyway.  The bad thing is that often this is the only place open to eat early in the morning or late at night.  Bad service and smelly restaurant equals disaster."}
{"text":"I come here a couple of times. Usually they get my order right but sometimes they don't, so I always got to check before I leave the parking lot.   It's a normal Burger King place but this one does have a tv inside.   When I order breakfast my favorite is the croissant sausage, egg, & cheese. Super good with hash browns. Breakfast ends at 10:30am. Also I like their whoppers & original chicken sandwich (add cheese to both of these sandwiches to taste way better it is extra though, but so worth it!) also their onion rings are delicious. Also ask for zesty sauce, taste good to dip your onion rings.   Download the Burger King app to get coupons to save some money. Also you don't have to carry all those paper coupons with you."}
{"text":"When we used to visit AZ we always came to this Burger King cause it was the closest to my cousins house. They did upgrade. I can't believe they still have a play place for the kids. Most burger kings took it out. There's also a tv inside this one. It's more modern looking inside. Also they have a soda machine that has a ton of flavors.   I love their breakfast sandwhich, the sausage egg & cheese croissant & hash browns.  The workers are really nice as well. Also it's nice & clean inside.   Make sure you download the Burger King app to save some money. There's coupons to use."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!  Order was wrong and burger was not wrapped properly so ingredients of burger fell out in bag.  Went back through drive through and still got order wrong.  They also threw in a chicken sandwich (I didn't order) that obviously had been premade and had been sitting around for awhile.  Employees were rude and not willing to help.  Ended up accepting what they gave me because they apparently had no idea what they were doing!  Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"I was almost sent away without them giving me my change paid with a twenty on four dollar bill was handed my food and the girl shut the window in drive through. Had to honk to get their attention to get my change. They'll try to short change you so make sure you get your change first. Sad very Sad!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 2 and a half, but the workers were sweet and smiled, so I'll round up.  Restrooms were cleaner than a gas station and had locking doors, be aware ladies that there is no mirror in the restrooms for a pit stop touch up.   The food was hot and to standard, though shortly after leaving I came to find that my order was not to my specifications.   I will say that the design and ambiance of this Burger King is like none other. In a pit stop area surrounded by sand, they took the initiative to make what could be an eye sore into a shining gem in the city of Buckeye."}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars I would. This is the closest Burger King to me and it's frustrating every damn time I get food, it's either cold or smashed. Today it was smashed. When they ask me if I need ketchup or napkins I tell them no and ask if I can have some ranch instead and they respond with a yes you can and when I get my food I don't have any ranch but a shit ton of ketchup. Every. Time. And I'll even ask them if there's ranch in the bag and they say yes but it's not. There's another review here and the guy mentioned he stopped to fuel up on food one morning and the workers were partying and messing around and had the bathrooms lock and I can confirm that. Many many times I've gone into the restaurant and all of the workers are laughing and messing around by the cash registers. I hate coming to this restaurant but I'm forced to unless I want to drive further from my home/ route to work."}
{"text":"I love the whopper, but I haven't able to eat one in about 2 months at this location. Why? Allow me to elaborate. I work nights down the street, I have gone on my lunch time & they claim not to have any tomatoes or letting. What kind of crap is that. Luckily McDonalds is across the street. Shame on you BK!!!"}
{"text":"They advertise macaroni and cheese and apple fries but they don't have that and they didn't even tell me. When I ordered apple fries I go through and I get apple slices with peels. For my child who is a year old that's not going to cut it with the peels. When I asked them about it they said sorry that they no longer sell it. I asked them why they advertise it and they said that it was because of corporate and not their particular facility. Not cool. And not customer friendly."}
{"text":"the old building was torn down and new one built, I liked the old one"}
{"text":"Yesterday at 5pm I order a whopper with no onion, not only that it came with onions the meat was dry, not warm and the cheese wasn't even melted all the way.  I was the only one in the drive thru so they weren't even busy.  Horrible experience"}
{"text":"Pretty good location. Didn't take long to get the food we ordered. We even got a milkshake which is obviously not their main menu item, but it was really good. Had to wait a little longer than usual but that was because of the customers in front of us. Cashier was nice and no complaints with the quality of our food. Overall good experience! Will return again."}
{"text":"I usually would think one Burger King is the same as the next but....wow....this place was terrible! I got a coupon in the mail and saw they have a new chicken parm sandwich and I was in a hurry so I decided what the hell. After I ordered and I got to the window, the woman at the window didn't even acknowledge me. After a few minutes, she told me my total, I paid, she gave me my food and closed the window. Never heard another word after my total. That should have been an indication of what my food was going to be like. When I pulled up to the end of the drive thru, I opened my bag, unwrapped my sandwich and thought the bread was a bit cold. I took a bite into my sandwich only to find that bun was slightly frozen, the marinara sauce cold, the cheese frozen and the chicken lukewarm at best!  I put the car in reverse, went to the window and waited. The same woman opened the window, didn't say anything to me so I told her about the sandwich. I explained that the sandwich was cold and the cheese was frozen. Her reply?  Well after what seemed like an eternity of silence, her reply was \"no it's not. The cheese is cold though\". I said \"noooo...the sandwich is cold and the bun is a bit frozen still\". After snatching the sandwich out of my hand, she closed the window. A couple minutes later a guy handed me a bag with a new sandwich. Again, no words. Just window opened and then closed. I was afraid to open the bag but I was brave. This time the chicken was hot and everything was cold.  I couldn't even eat it. I just ended up throwing it away. They have lost my business."}
{"text":"I agree with the other posts on here. This is the slowest Burger King with the rudest people at the drive-through. But today was different. There was a girl named Sabrina at the drive-through who was absolutely the nicest person that I've seen work there. Kudos to you Sabrina you make that place look good. Tell your manager to give you a raise or at least let him allow you to train the other employees on what good customer service should be like."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a fast food veggie burger option!! Please keep it on your menu. It was delicious!   I can't say much about the inside of this establishment since I went through the drive thru.   The drive thru service was fast!"}
{"text":"Fast food is fast food, but this location has had good customer service every time I go there. Drive thru and in the lobby. I just have to cross my fingers each day in hope of getting hash browns when they are freshly made lol."}
{"text":"Microwaved Meals!  So i ended up at this terminal during a morning flight and was starving. Found the burgerking and was ready to have a biscuit, egg, sausage muffin with hash and orange juice. This BK was strange in that you picked up your selected sandwich through a window-ish thing on the counter.   This particular visit revealed:  1) No Biscuits!! Everything is in a croissant... sadface 2) Nothing was hot and ready 3) Burger King employee was putting things in the microwave, heating them up, and then sliding the sandwiches through the window. Gross. 4) Hash browns were a greasy, NOT CRISPY, mess! 5) Orange juice couldnt be messed up (it came out a tropicana mini box) 5) Service - Terrible!   And how much did I spend to have this experience $8!... Yes, I got ripped a new one at the airport yet again!"}
{"text":"Is is possible to give a negative star rating? I go through drive thru and order bacon croissant meal no cheese with Dr pepper.  I pay I get me order no hash rounds.  He said I didn't order but will give then anyway.  I drive off.  Have to go back because the croissant itself is cold like out if the frig cold. I drive back and tell them.  The guy his back and pulls and box of bacon.  Says... \"Not to be funny but this was just cooked\"  I said in an not taking about the ingredients inside. I am talking about the croissant itself it's ice cold! I don't think it's supposed to be served cold. I told him he could keep the damn sandwich and I would be contacting the corporate offices, but there is no number. Maybe I will get lucky and they will read this review!! Will never go back to that one!!!!"}
{"text":"I live right down the way, this place is consistently this worst fast food restaurant that I have ever been to. Every.Single.Time. If it's not me sitting and waiting 5 minutes for someone just to take my order, it's the next 10 minutes I sit in line and no one moves. I have no idea what the people inside this building are doing, but it sure isn't making food. Every single person in this restaurant needs fired. EVERY ONE OF YOU. You are a terrible team. Cold fries, messed up orders, TERRIBLE!!! I can't over emphasise how much I hate every single one of you for messing up my favorite fast food chain. I'm just astonished that I've never seen such a large group of completely talentless, unmotivated human beings in my entire life. I hope you are all unemployed come next year."}
{"text":"Good place to eat & it's clean.    They have a tv. My favorite is the whopper with cheese (yes cheese is extra), original chicken sandwich with cheese & onion rings are bomb. I'm not to crazy about their fries.  Breakfast hours end at 10:30am.  Download the app for coupons."}
{"text":"This place looks like the old Burger King . It's old fashion decor. Definitely needs some improvements. They even have the mic to speak to the back of the kitchen! Reminds me of the YouTube girl bon qui qui.   Get the app to save you some money. They have deals/ coupon codes for you to use.   Came in today to get me some breakfast. Got sausage, egg & cheese croissant & hash browns with apple juice. I think they burnt my sausage."}
{"text":"New Grilled Chicken sandwich was great! Fast Friendly service.... clean"}
{"text":"The manager Ruthie is great! Fast friendly service. Good job I will be back Thanks to the new remodel"}
{"text":"Over $23 dollars for 2 \"value\" meals and both my husband and I got sick. Don't waste your money or ruin your health."}
{"text":"Didn't even want to give a 1 star this is the most disgusting place I have ever seen I'm appalled at the conditions of the play land.  All the tables were dirty when we arrived they came back to clean and left all this nasty food on the ground for the kids to play around"}
{"text":"Avoid this location.  Despite having a \"DRIVE THRU\"... they will ALWAYS make you pull around to the front and wait.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of driving through.  And 9 times out of 10, your order will be wrong and you'll have to go in to have it corrected.  Again - defeats the purpose of driving through.  Well this evening I very carefully gave my order.  Had to correct it twice as the guy taking the order (who I later learned is a manager) sounded distracted and wasn't getting it right.  Not confident in his order taking, I ask the girl at the window to read the order back.  Sounded good.  Then, as expected, she asked me to pull around front.  I declined.  I told her it was nothing against her but every time I pull around, my order is wrong.  She said okay but appeared annoyed.  At this point I am thinking they're probably going to spit in my food.  So I get my order and they shut the window.  Checking the bags, and guess what?  It's wrong.  So I wait.  I see the manager look at me several times but ignore the fact I'm still sitting at the window.  Finally he comes up and I tell him I'm missing a fry.  He asks for my bags.  So I give him back our bags and he starts going through them.  Now I'm grossed out.  I say, \"hey, you're putting your hands all over our food now!!  What the heck!?!?\"  He gives me the bags back, but now I'm just done.  I tell him I want a full refund and start to hand the bags back, and he refuses to take the bags.  I literally had to tell him \"take the bags, I want a refund\".  Then he says he can't give a refund without a receipt.  I'm like I never got the receipt!!!  He says again, \"no refund without a receipt\".  There's now about 5 cars behind me and I'm prepared to sit there until I get my refund.  I try handing him back our drinks and again, he won't take them.  Again I snap, \"take back the drinks!\"  Oh and he finally found the receipt IN THE BAGS.  Finally issued a refund.  I ask for the managers name, he tells me, and then I asked when she would be him.  He lies and says he doesn't know.  So I'm like, ok, I'll call the number on the window.  He lies again and says \"go ahead, it just calls the store.\"  Funny because I called the number and it goes to corporate.  Oh, and then he slammed the window.  Great manager!!!  Marc should be fired.  He is terrible, which is why this location is often terrible.    Done with this location."}
{"text":"Brand new today in Las Vegas, this Burger King is located on the south west corner of the Mountain's Edge Marketplace near Albertsons. It has two drive-thru lanes, a kids play area, a new Freestyle Coke fountain drink machine, several TVs, power ports to charge devices, Wi-Fi, high top and lower tables, a table with lights embedded and a new building smell."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO to this restaurant!  George the so-called manager should not be in customer service let alone be an example of customer service. After not having my order complete in the drive thru I was asked to move forward to wait so I asked for a courtesy beverage and George the so-called manager immediately became hostile, yelling, and slammed the drive thru window closed but not before yelling \"stay right there LADY!\".  After receiving the food I had paid for prior to them asking me to move without it,  I parked and returned the food.   The first thing George the so called manager does is threaten to call the police while at the same time checking the bag for missing food like I didn't just leave the drive thru unhappy.   I did get a refund but store number 16506 is joke with George the so-called manager"}
{"text":"Well this sad!! I ordered the new Sourdough with bacon egg and cheese. It took almost 8 minutes to get served my order after I ordered it. Then I drove home and found that they gave me a sourdough with sausage egg and bacon. The sandwich I ordered was supposed to have sourdough with double bacon double egg and Double cheese. So I'm not sure what to think. It was a ok sandwich but if I wanted one thing and paid for something else I don't think that is right. I would like to get what I ordered not what someone decided they would give me. I also can't figure out what took so long to fill my order there was no one inside waiting to order. Two employees were standing at the counter waiting for my sandwich a guy took my order a woman delivered my order. What is that about?"}
{"text":"Good place to pickup fast food on the way some place. Good fast service friendly! Food is hot and fresh! A nice change from my Wednesday location before I go to my cigar shop! Every place has its time and place I life today! This how my life works today being Wednesday and all a drink a sandwich something quick and easy!"}
{"text":"We rarely go to BK but today.. we ordered cheetos fries. Get tot the window and they didn't put it in the bag and the lady says it's in there and asks for the bag back to \"double check.\" OF COURSE it's not in there. So we waited for them to make it and then they give us cheesy tots. Went in to the store to say it's not what we orders and then she says they are out of the Cheetos fries. Like wtf? Just left out of frustration and started to eat it and it's NOT COOKED all the way!! The center of the cheesy tots was still cold. Will not be back to that location ever. Rude lady working and it wasn't even busy! There was 1 car behind us and 1 car in the parking lot."}
{"text":"We were craving for original chicken sandwich. So we ordered 2. My husband's sandwich was good. I took a couple of bites on mine and it tasted weird. When i opened it... here's what it looks like. Why would you serve a burnt bun??.... so disappointed!!!! If i could post my review with ZERO stars i definitely would!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, you don't go to an airport and expect to get a 5 star meal.  It's where you buy food when you have no other options or need to get something quick.  If you've already past thru security then your options are limited.  This is the same greasy junk that you would get at any other Burger King- don't expect so much as a smile from the employees.  Sticky floors, messy counters, but you get what you would expect.  If you've got some extra time- head to Paradise Bakery in the main area of the airport- outside of the security lines.  Much better quality food."}
{"text":"There must have been a change In management since either one of the last two reviews were posted, every time i get Burger King here my food is almost always fresh and even if it isn't it's still kept warm and isn't very bad at all. Whenever you order an actual sandwich that isn't just a cheap dollar one they usually ask you to pull ahead and wait, I know it's fast food but at least now you know they're making your food fresh, so this is actually a good thing. The food I get from here is also not very sloppy, the burgers and sandwiches are not crushed they look similar to what you would see on the commercial. Overall a 4 star because it's not a perfect burger king but it is a very good one, at least now it is if it wasn't back in 2012 like the other reviews are dated."}
{"text":"Had the 89 cent large pancakes.  HaHa  I guess I shouldn't have expected much for 89 cents but don't advertise how big they are supposed to be when they clearly aren't.  You get 3 pancakes that fit into a sandwich box.  That's how \"Giant\" they are.  LOL  Also there was a slice in the one syrup packet that leaked all over the bag.   Drive thru employee not friendly at all"}
{"text":"I couldn't check in because there was no business listing.  Is everybody who comes here so ashamed as this place has never had a review?  I mean this place has been here for as long as I can remember and yes we're talking multiple decades.  Out of the big 3 (or big 5 if you include Harvey's and A&W) BK is probably my least favorite of the chains.  Their food is really the epitome of unhealthy sub-par fast food.  If I am eating here it's because it's open, I'm hungry or I had no other choice.  I came here because my nephew said he wanted a Whopper for dinner.  I wasn't going to try to persuade him to go else where like Wendy's or McDonald's.  I see him so infrequently I wanted him to have want he wanted.  I could eat at BK it's not great food but it's passable.    Well we ordered our food and it's a good thing I had coupons because this is the place I wouldn't want to eat at and pay full price.  Their quality has gone WAY down from what I remember and this particular location is not very clean, the service is slow and the place is overall downright depressing.  There is no real way to properly explain that except to see it for yourself.  You have to ask for ketchup as there isn't a dispenser to serve yourself.  I'm surprised they actually let you help yourself to the napkins and that those aren't controlled as well.  You know when a place starts to \"control\" things like the condiments or the napkins (Taco Bell at Dufferin and King circa 1994) that the place is worried about patrons taking more than what is considered a fair share.  Far be it from me to take extra ketchup home or napkins or salt or pepper.    You know why you can refill your drink a million times?  Because that stuff is worthless.  Water, CO2, syrup.  Yes the lid, the cup and straw are worth more than the liquid inside.    BK still has daily deals.  You can replace your fries for onion rings instead for your combo.  Recently trips to either Wendy's or McDonald's allowed me to swap out my soft drink for a bottle of water (Dasani).  I didn't even ask at BK if I could do that.  I should have but I had a feeling the answer would have been no.    While BK doesn't fry their burgers they are still reheated (microwaved) and overall the veggies and everything else seems so artificial and not fresh.  Maybe other locations are actually better or higher quality or perhaps all BK's have gone downhill?  I was wary of buying 10 chicken \"pieces\" for 1.79.  Honestly something that cheap I simply can't trust.  It's bad enough I'm venturing into this place but I'm going to try chicken parts that are that cheap?  Safe to say this isn't real chicken pieces but rather reconstituted pieces of chicken.    Don't get me wrong I'm not a snob when it comes to fast food in fact I consider myself an expert when it comes to it because I've had just about everything from chains coast to coast north and south and BK is or has fallen so far down my priority list it's a wonder that I even went here.    2* = I've had better?  So have you, believe me."}
{"text":"Tried Burger King a few times with mixed results. Finally a visit worthy of a review.   I was greeted cheerily and he efficiently took my order. I got the Four Cheese Whopper, fries and a drink for $7.90. A better price than nearby Carl's Jr. so here's hoping it's still good quality!  To my delight, it was excellent. I don't mean to gush over a burger and fries but, as fast food goes, it was really good. The bun was fresh, the patty was flame-broiled tasty, the veggies were crisp and just the right amount of sauce. The fries were fluffy and crisp with salt just right. You couldn't improve upon it. The service was outstanding as well.   I don't know if I've been missing out on a good restaurant or just a good sandwich, so stay tuned for an update: I work a 1/2 mile away."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru here just now took about 20 minutes just to get through to my order and there was only two cars in front of me and on top of that while waiting for my food I can see that the lobby was empty"}
{"text":"I popped into the drive-thru for lunch one day when I was short on time. This is the perfect place when you're in a hurry!   The drive-thru was totally full, but it took me less than 5 minutes to get through it with my food. The employees were all polite, but businesslike.   While I don't resort to fast food often, I'll be back here next time the situation calls for it!"}
{"text":"Wow are they bad here.  Front counter woman was clueless.  I had to point out on the menu what I want because she didn't understand \"kid's meal\" or \"king jr meal\".  She eventually thought she had it but rang it up wrong.  Finally the manager had to help her.    Food was quick but they forgot the spoon for her apple sauce, her toy, her drink and my dipping sauce.  Seriously, it's not rocket science.  I can understand the new woman in the workforce but a manager messing up this badly?!  We'll never be back to this BK even though I go to the car wash next door frequently.  EDIT: As we were leaving they were serving a lady with a non-service dog in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Newest Burger King in Las Vegas and it features a completely redesigned decor, it's very bright plus it has entertainment technology throughout. There are several flat screen televisions and they allow you to change the channels.  There is free WiFi, but I wasn't able to get it to work on several devices. Hopefully, that's a minor issue that will be fixed soon. The most exciting part of the visit was the, \"make it your way\" Coke machine. There are 100's of possible drink combinations with this device. Everyone had a great time making mixed drinks.   Getting to this location is easy, but not to leave. If you need to go South on the Las Vegas Strip, you need to go North for a few blocks in order to do a uturn. This can be a problem for this location in terms of sales."}
{"text":"The king is really doing it big. It's fun new casual look is so cool. Also it has a indoor playground very nice staff and to top it all lots of new things on the menu. The food is hot the store is super clean. Try the new peach tea its a personal favorite of mine."}
{"text":"This location is just gross. My husband found TWO hairs in his burger. The person preparing our food had no gloves on. Just because you have 1 hour left til closing doesn't mean that all the rules and health codes go out the window and don't apply! NEVER AGAIN will we be back here. I wish there were negative stars. They don't even deserve one."}
{"text":"As fast food burger places go, this BK location isn't too bad.   For a long time BK was a one trick pony, with their Charbroiled Whopper sandwiches. But now,  you see Chicken, Breakfast, 60% healthier fries, Big King, a Big Mac like double burger, and the not too healthy cinnamon buns have all been added. LOL.   Still... they are no competition for the Oakbrook, IL folk, but BK is getting their corporate act together. Some might say finally.   The employees all seem nice and helpful; while not looking too close at those just expired coupons. LOL I agree with fellow Yelp'ers Andrew and Javier in their assessment and call your attention to their Reviews.   So Three and a Half Stars, and A-Ok in my book."}
{"text":"Burger King tries really hard to be as good as McDonald's!  I received a coupon from one of the Phoenix area coupons books that all school kids seem to sell these days.  The expiration was at the end of the month, so I decided to give them a try.  Wow, the menu has gone upscale!    Now, we have good looking salads, wrap sandwiches, smoothie drinks and even Cinnabons.  Also, Burger King has this new TV ads featuring celebrities like David Beckham, Jay Leno, Salma Hayek and R&B singer Mary J. Blige.  Who sings about the ingredients of their snack wraps.  Sad.  Read more: http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2012/04/03/burger-king-new-menu-looks-lot-like-mcdonald/#ixzz2E7SB7fqW  The one problem I see is their need to upgrade the taste of the older food items.  Their Classic Chicken Sandwich is still a piece of process meat, and the Whopper still has those little pieces of brown substance on one side of their burger.    My last rant will be the taste of their onions, which still tastes as if they've left them out too long and have oxidized.  I know I'm going to regret it in several hours."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service (if you can call it that). Incompetent staff and manager who could not even process a refund (Order 53 at about 9pm on 09/25/15). Please, I insist that you change the money I paid where my order was not fulfilled or refunded ($9.52), change it to pennies, get some lubricant and shove each and every penny up your asses.  Don't plan to purchase any more food from BK, they just don't care......"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Burger King to come to because the employees are always so friendly and kind! Today, I went through the drive thru and got two bacon cheeseburgers and a double cheeseburger plain. None of them were plan (it could've easily been my fault) and I went inside to have them fixed. The manager was so kind about it as were the ladies behind the desk!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Burger King ever. If you're cool with attitude, slow service, and poorly presented food, it's your place! They'll mess up orders. Ask for everyone's tickets and then challenge what you ordered - with major attitude and flair. If you are what you eat, you'll be burping up negative attitude for hours. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you like being ignored and finally being served cold food.  Service is slow -- very slow.  Place is dirty.  Counter employees act like they are doing you a favor by taking an order.  Notice I did not say \"workers\" as that surely does not apply.  By the time the food arrives it is cold.  There are many fast food outlets near this place, even the worst of them is better than this one."}
{"text":"Just visited this BK today because their slogan \"Have it your way\" really enticed me to get a ice cream cone. Well I completely forgot that they don't abide by their slogan. It really should be called \"We screw up your order our way!\" I got charged $18 for my ice cream cone and was also handed just a large drink. So I told them I ordered ice cream and the cashier looked at me like he was so confused. So about 10 minutes of figuring out how to give me my money back he just told me ok the money is back on the card. So I said ok I need the receipt that states that and he said he can't give it to me there is only one.  so please BK, can you either fix your machine so it prints copies of receipts or at least fix your employees brains! thanks!"}
{"text":"We love coming here especially for breakfast. Aimme who took our orders was super nice and efficient."}
{"text":"Just picked up a bite to eat after work through drive through. I was given total then handed food without a word, comment or thank you! She (Monique) appeared to be bothered to be working and would be concerned if I was the owner about customer experience."}
{"text":"Food is the standard fast-food. Store is clean. Staff always seems extremely bored and lifeless when I go. No smiles. More like \"Here's you food, now go!\" The fact they do not take BK coupons miffs me too."}
{"text":"Worst Burger King ever love bk but not this one.its ghetto the people yell at you when you ask if they have coke freestyle abs forget to mute their headset and say \"why can't white people just drink regular soda\" they never can get organized enough to get the orders ready and when you go in it's a chaotic mess and this is breakfast food people and when you go back to tell them about the missing order they say \"you are just going to have to wait we have no egg\" so if want to waste 20 min of your morning and start it pissed of go here."}
{"text":"I usually stay away from fast food, but I happened to be working in the area and was too lazy to drive further away for lunch.  Upon entry there was a BK employee on break eating BK food, always an encouraging sign when employees eat company food. Customer service was friendly, unfortunately that was about all that was good. $7.80 on two chicken sandwiches plus value onion rings. Food was below average although not terrible. What really brought this rating down was cleanliness, it seemed as though no matter where I sat a group of nats or a fly or two were sure to follow! That and the seats looked like they haven't been wiped down in days.  Now that I think about it, the last time I enjoyed BK was when I was a kid and my friends and I were in San Diego staying by the beach, we'd grab the original chicken sandwiches at night.   Bottom line: Don't bother with this place, if you're in the area just go a bit further east and you will find much better places in Chinatown.  Customer service = 4 stars. Food =2 stars. Atmosphere = N/A Cleanliness = 1 star. Final = 2/5 stars. (based on a fast food place)  Total cost of experience = $7.80 What it felt like it should cost = $2.50"}
{"text":"Only ever get the whopper, and all the burger kings make them the same... so I'm pretty happy.  Nuff said"}
{"text":"This place should be shut down by the health department.  low standards well it is Las Vegas what do you expect?  Microwaved bk veggie served hard as a rock.  Pathetic service careless about food quality.  Could not eat the food, it was the worst thing I have ever tasted.  They were too stupid to know how to cook it properly. Had to toss it in the trash  store #14498"}
{"text":"It's too bad I have to give this even 1 star.  It deserves none.  I found myself at this location twice.  The first was on Mother's Day.   We wanted a quick breakfast and try the pancakes without having to wait. We planned on having a large meal later in the day by trying a Japanese restaurant.  Anyway, we stopped at this BK Sunday morning about 10:30 am, but it was closed.  Apparently, management wasn't interested in catching any customers.    This past week, during our travels, we had a coupon and stopped at the first BK we hit, which just happened to be this place.  I recognized the place, so we went in.  When I presented the coupon, I was told management didn't honor them.  I remember asking \"Are you kidding me\".  He explained they weren't involved in any regular BK advertising.  I looked around at a completely empty dining area (it was at 5:00 pm) and stated \"Now I see why your place is empty\".  The employee stated, \"if you are dead set on using that coupon, there is another BK down the road.\"    I decided we did not want to stay there, so we went down the road, found another BK and had a completely different & pleasant experience.  I don't know what this owner is thinking, but BK should step in and terminate his rights to the BK name.  He doesn't deserve it."}
{"text":"We go to this one a lot. Great deal for the kids meal's. Playland was clean and fun. The food has always been better than any other locations."}
{"text":"I will never visit Burger King again. Just drove thru this location's drive thru. The woman was so rude to us in the drive thru. My nine year old daughter even noticed. The burger was cold, too.  2nd time at this location. Never again."}
{"text":"This is not a good location. I've gone twice. Once, I was the only person in line at drive thru. Nobody inside either. I still had to pull around and wait 10 minutes for my food. Tonight, very similar. We ordered, we were the only ones in the drive thru and nobody inside. We were handed our drinks, and then told to pull up to the trash can and then back our car back to the window. We asked why. The girl at the drive thru said it was to keep her window times good. She just kept telling us we needed to pull forward and then back up. Frankly if you can't handle one customer, you don't deserve good window times or whatever. Not gonna jump through hoops for you. Still took too long to get our food. It's quite ridiculous we've been twice and had bad experiences."}
{"text":"I waited in line 20 minutes (3 cars ahead only), at the register they did not have my order, that was the longest fast food wait ever for a soda (80% ice) and a cone!  Now it will be another 10 years before through a drive through again."}
{"text":"This BK closed for good on Dec 31st 2014. Which sucks since the next closet one is at 48th and Warner.  This location was way better.  Why did you do this to me BK?"}
{"text":"I still enjoy a whopper once in a while so I can say I am a fan of Burger King; however, I try to avoid some fast food joints on a daily basis so I don't make my stomach too big. I also still enjoy their chicken nuggets and chocolate shakes"}
{"text":"Everytime I'm here they mess up my orders, give me cold ass food, and fries that are gross! You got one job BK, so do the ONLY job you have right"}
{"text":"Not bad, decent prices and relatively fast service. I would always come here instead of McDonald's because it's closer. It also looks really nice after the renovations."}
{"text":"Normally I dont expect much at a fast food joint but last night I went and the serives was way above par. Food was nice and fresh and I didnt have to get them to make my food over for my special burger. Was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Dropped in to use the bathroom (sadly Shock G was not getting busy with a ticklish fat girl in there) and saw menses on the toilet seats. Full on blood clot menses...and this was in the men's room.  My sister reported that someone left a nice pile of semi-solid feces in the middle of the ladies room floor."}
{"text":"I work nearby and have nothing negative to say about this location. They don't screw up your order which is always nice (ordering in or at the drive-thru). The staff is polite and unlike a lot of places no one is yelling or cursing at each other. Loses a star because it could you use a little facelift."}

{"text":"7/31/2015 615pm This store was mostly clean as we entered, the counter person was in the lobby area cleaning but quickly came around the counter to wait on us. My wife ordered a sandwich without onions, Medium onion rings and a medium drink. I ordered a double whopper no cheese with extra onions, medium onion rings and medium drink. As we ordered, the manager told the kitchen to pitch the old onion rings and put down a new batch. The person on the fryer, cooked new onion rings and then ate a part of one to see if they were done. He then proceeded to put the new onion rings on top of the old rings.  Got our order and my wife asks me to see if the counter person rung us up with medium combos or small as for her meal was small size and not medium like she asked for. We were charged for one small and one medium combo. Then my wife got her sandwich but with onions, she took it back and the manager on duty apologized and had the kitchen make her a new correct sandwich. I took my sandwich home for later only to discover that it was wrong also. It was a triple whopper with cheese instead of what I ordered.  Two sandwiches, two orders of onion rings and two drinks and this store messed up both sandwiches and got the size wrong on one of the combo's. But at least the on duty manager was very nice. If it wasn't for the manager, I probably would have only given one star."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Burger King to go to. They almost always get our orders right and sometimes it's slow because it extremely busy but besides that we always get good service and good food."}
{"text":"Unlike that last reviewer said it's a very good location to go to. We never had anything bad happen to us there and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Order a whopper meal and chicken sandwich. The sandwiches were extremely greasy, the bottom buns were soggy as hell! My fries were burnt, no soft texture at all. You would think having to pull up front to wait for your food it would be prepared well but nope! Over did it on the mayo as well, mayo was dripping from the sides. I tried calling the store 3 times and no answer! $15 of waste!"}
{"text":"While not 24 hours or open late (past last call) the drive through here is open until 1am.  The Wendy's across the street closes at midnight.    Honestly out of all the fast food burger chains I know BK is my least favorite but when it's after midnight and before 1am this place can perhaps be your best friend.    When I went it was a short line (one car in front of me) and waiting for the food took less than 5 minutes.  When you need a double Whopper and poutine... ya sometimes you just do.    BK is still not great but hey I needed them and they were there.  Other fast food options in the area include Burger's Priest, California Sandwiches, Wendy's, KFC/Taco Bell however none are open past midnight."}
{"text":"I have been working thru this airport since the mid 90's and I don't know how this place has stayed in business. I have had a couple of employees over the years literally can count on one hand that are nice do a good job and seem to care. That's the reason for the 1 star, BK is one of my fav's when in a hurry or crave fast food but this one needs a major overhaul. Food most of the time is so so, when the order is actually right. Customer service is pathetic so anyway, that's what to expect if your in a hurry and choose to stop by this one. I do hope the place improves."}
{"text":"Ive been eating the big fish sandwich for years and it's never come with pickles on it. I got about 10 pickles on it this time (i can't stand them) and so even after taking them off, the whole thing tasted like pickles. I ate a few bites and tossed it. Lettuce was also soggy and gross and the fish patty tasted old.  They get 2 stars instead of 1 because I've ordered other things at this location and they've been fine. Next time I'm craving fish I'll go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I am beyond disgusted with this location. One of the managers (Neftaly) should not be in a manager position. He is rude, crude and the way he speaks to his female employee while customers are around is horrible. I realize maybe this employee likes to be spoken to like that but they should do it on their own time. I am even more disgusted with the way their \"customer support\" person handled things. I was told by Elizabeth the day manager to call the the number at the bottom of the receipt so I did. I haven't heard one thing about my complaint but they were sure to call Elizabeth to ask her about my complaint. I don't know who does the hiring for these positions but their customer service skills are horrible. It's been a few weeks now of me waiting to hear back from someone and nothing. If Burger King does business like this I want nothing to do with their company. I may be just one person but keep up the horrible job and you will lose more. Neftaly can't even get a simple order right to save his life and I know this because he has failed on my orders at least 3 different occasions. I hope this location closes so another restaurant can take its place. That would be amazing. The one star is only because I am force to give it by the way. Steer clear of this location if you want your correct order."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Im eating here as i write this. There are 0 customers here and the lobby has food everywhere! Tables are gross and the employees are standing around talking to each other. My whopper was thrown together. This place is nasty as hell!!! Im done eating burger king. Never again"}
{"text":"Just went to the drive thru. It was painless fast and very accurate. So I give them four stars. The lady who helped me was sweet and very professional.  I will stop in often to eat inside and wow my food is so hot and yummy!"}
{"text":"this place is a disgusting.. i saw a mouse run across the floor of these place.. dirty everywhere i see why there rating is a  89%.. bewear of eating here i dont know how there still open for business if you want stomach poison give it a try"}
{"text":"Was in drive thru for 25 min...terrible service..no discount..7 drivers behind me. Needs new management..food was cold icee melted."}
{"text":"This Burger King has consistently made errors with my orders. I don't always have time to go through my bag and pull everything out and check. Also they will serve you food that has been sitting out that is room temperature such as burgers. Depends on who is serving you is the type of service you'll receive. I wish management took pride in running this restaurant, I'm starting to see this more often than not. This sucks because I like BK, and the other well kept/great service BK is not near me so I have to always eat in when I go there. If I decide to go back to this one I'll update post with experience."}
{"text":"Ok, so it's a fast food joint?  How wrong can they really go?  I went in here on a Tuesday afternoon around 1:00.  There was no lunch rush happening.  Apparently this location has problems with people stealing napkins and ketchup, because there were none of the self service stations where you can load up.    The person who took my order was incredibly rude.  There was no one in line behind me, and she kept trying to make me leave her counter while I was still putting my credit card away.  She told me where I could stand and wait 5 times.    They pour the soda there, and she had managed to cover the outside of the cup with as much liquid as was inside.  Oh, and asking for a napkin to clean up her mess....that's a big no no too.  As I walked away, she proceeded to have a conversation with another employee about what a bitch I was for mentioning the sticky cup situation.  In Spanish.  I speak Spanish.   When they did toss my food at me, I had to ask for ketchup and napkins.  They asked how many napkins I needed. I would have asked for more if I had known that EVERY table in their lobby would be filthy.  Honestly, I probably would have felt better about eating out back by their dumpster.  Finally someone did come out to clean the lobby.  Instead of wiping the table, she simply swept up a cloud, right next to me.    Needless to say, this had to be one of the worst Burger Kings I have ever been too."}
{"text":"The kids and I went there to get a snack. The girl taking the order seemed like she didn't want to even be at work. She was rude even when  we pulled up to the window. You are in customer service idiot. If you hate your job then QUIT,!. I will never go there again. Rude service . Whopper was bland fries were cold."}
{"text":"Usually service here is a little better than most BKs I've been to.  But service has gone downhill.  Tonight had two issues.  1- At drivethru was asked to pull forward even though noone was behind me.  When I asked why, even though I already knew the answer, I was told \"because the food will take a few minutes to prepare and it's eating up our drivethru time.\"  The while purpose of the clock and goals is to identify times where they're not meeting expectations and customer satisfaction.  Just a pet peeve.  Oh byvthe way, we ordered absolutely from the menu.  No additions, subtractions or special requests.  2- One of the meals we ordered was a Whopper with cheese.  Got home and tha's what we got, a Whopper patty with cheese.  No ketchup, no lettuce, tomato or onion.  Just a burger, piece of cheese on a smashed bun.  In conclusion, I am deeply disappointed.  We all see the BKs are struggling and one of the only fast food chains that is closing more stores than they're opening.  They need to get back to the basics if they want to be successful.  Chic-fil-A has set the standard, at least the ones I've been to, for excellent and quick customer service with a smile.  That model is one to emulate, but BK is headed in the wrong direction."}
{"text":"I really don't even like Burger King to begin with, but when I need something for breakfast I'll go there (ultimately I'll regret it ... yuck). Anyway, there always seems to be an issue with every order. Recently I got the Ultimate Platter which is supposed to include hash browns. Well, there were none. I decided to try it on another occasion and the pancakes were fused together (see photo). I've also received the wrong size of different items or I've asked for coffee with cream and sugar and they gave me black coffee. The workers there are very nice (usually...there's one \"girl\" there who's grumpy) but otherwise they are quite nice."}
{"text":"This location is sad. It honestly seems like no one really cares. My order is always wrong, every time. I was super excited about this location opening up near me because every BK in the city is like this but it only took a few tries for this location to prove it to me that they're just like the rest of them."}
{"text":"Eat somewhere else.  Whopper Jr sub par - hot but not good.  Bun must have been 10 weeks old.  Two stars for good fries & fast, courteous service."}
{"text":"terrible, forgot half my order and barely said a word to me the whole time. Total lack of service. Don't go here"}
{"text":"Extremely dirty restaurant, especially the play area tables. Drink station was a complete disaster. I'm afraid to know what the kitchen looks like, as we go through the drive thru once in a while. Always have enjoyed the food, but hesitant to come back after seeing the inside."}
{"text":"This place is crap the employees are rude and the food is just nasty. Every single time its cold and they put the sandwiches together lackadaisical it is sad and hugely disappointing! They truly need to get it together!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Shouldn't even be considered as \"fast\" food if they are going to take more than half an hour just to give me my food. They are out of place. Can't keep it in order. They hop from ticket 359 to 370  to 365. This restuarant is pathetic."}
{"text":"Burger King works hard to compete with the likes of McDonald's, Wendy's , Carl, Jr, etc, but never seems to get it quite right. Regrettably I might add since their burgers have a unique taste because of the broiling of their meat patties.   As for this location, the chain tries hard and seems to execute. The employees are happy and helpful, more concerned with the customer experience which is great.  Recently they were running a buy one, get one free campaign on their Wopper, which they were willing to exchange for a Classic Chicken sandwich.   Nice job!"}
{"text":"I came to this location to enjoy a meal. The cashier was friendly and Happy to take your order. I saw my order up and I walked up to the front. I watched my food sit there for 5 minutes.  When I asked the manager if it was done he said not yet and turned his back to me. He then placed my food on a tray left it on the counter and turned around again. Even when I asked for ranch he would not acknowledge me and had someone else give me the ranch. This is not how you treat a guest to your location. Bad service from the manager. Sacha is amazing she was happy and helpful that is the type of person I would like to see running the place."}
{"text":"The staff here is very indifferent and uncaring.  They do not seem to care at all what the customer needs or thinks.  I know that 0.81¢ is not much for a cup of ice cream, but this is ridiculous.  She could have filled it to the line.  I have seen these filled above the rim...hence the domed lid..."}
{"text":"This is about the worst burger king. There is no customer service. Went through the drive-up. They almost made my order wrong. I caught their mistake. Then I had to drive to the front to wait for my food.  Sucks!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I ate at a BK. I know that it's just fast-food so my expectations are not very high, but sheesh... this place was terrible! It's fairly new and reasonably neat building and that's about the best thing I can say. Very uninterested staff. No ice tea today as the Asst. Manager said that he tried to make some earlier but it didn't turn out. The ketchup dispenser was broken and he said he tried to fix it yesterday but couldn't. I ordered  a Sourdough King. The bun was toasted golden brown (probably hours earlier) and was microwaved to a soggy but rubbery mass that held some hocky-puck-like dried-out pseudo-meat. Inedible! The Frys were cold. My partner ordered a Spicy chicken sandwich and it also  was nasty. The really telling thing we should have paid attention to was the fact that we were the only patrons except one other guy at 6:30 pm on a Thursday evening. I don't understand  how a big franchise like this can be in such disarray.  I'm sure I won't bother with any other Burger King again and absolutely not this one. I predict this one will not survive for long. 1 star is too much. TERRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"Just got a microwave double cheeseburger...bag was on fire, touched the pickles Yep even hotter I didn't get it I'm sorry or I'll make you a new one it was just quietly trying to figure out how to use the cash register while I stood there awkward awkward awkward"}
{"text":"The overall order process and repetition of my order was fine. I paid and received my change with no issue. After I received my food in the drive-thru I went home with confidence in what I had received because I had never had a problem with this certain store or food chain. I paid for 2 20 piece orders of chicken nuggets and two chicken sandwiches. Even though it was less Han 20 I expected to be at least fulfilled completely. When I got home I realized i only had only received 20 chicken nuggets but had been charged for 40 and the chicken sandwiches, which were under cooked. It was really disappointing. I was never asked if I wanted sauces for my chicken nuggets and didn't receive any offer of them. It was my mistake for not saying anything at the time but it's still a rob of my money. I didn't even eat anything."}
{"text":"Drive thru order: Girl says, \"Go ahead with your order.\" Right away I figure she doesn't want to be there.  I ordered a cheeseburger, a 6 piece nugget, and a small root beer.  After an almost 10 minute wait (3 cars in front of me), I got to the window and handed the girl my card to pay.  She gave my card back, with a MASSIVE cup of root beer.  (I only wanted small because it was for my son.) I didn't say anything about it.  Then, 3 minutes later, she comes to the window and hands me a large bag FULL of food.  I explain this isn't my food & that I just wanted a cheeseburger & nuggets for my kid.  The girl yells at the other girl standing in the front, \"Man, this ain't even her order!!!!\" Then they fuss back and forth, trying to figure out what I ordered.  I showed her MY receipt, just so she could understand what I was telling her.  My kid is a picky eater (as most kids are) & we were coming back from basketball practice.  He was hungry.  Chicken nuggets....not difficult to understand.  A few minutes later I get a bag with 10 nuggets & a cheeseburger.  Finally! I figured the extra nuggets were for my time, then I looked back at the receipt and saw that she rang me up for 10.  All that and the cheeseburger bun was STALE!!!! I'll never go back here."}
{"text":"I don't eat that much fast food anymore.  I certainly don't eat at burger \"joints\" anymore, but when I found myself in the drive through with my expecting daughter I decided to check the chicken nuggets.   I ordered the chicken fries.  My granddaughter had the whole chicken nuggets.  My chicken fries were too spicy and very greasy.  I did not find them appetizing at all.  My granddaughter started to feed me her nuggets and I thought \"What the heck,\" and nibbled.  They were vastly better but still a bit greasy.   If I need a chicken nugget fix I will not go here.  I think there is somewhere else I would rather go."}
{"text":"By far the worst Burger King I've ever been to! I went through the drive-thur to grab some lunch and have never been treated so rude! Was told to wait five times and sat there for 5 mins (which I'm fine with waiting) but the rudeness is outstanding! I ended up telling the girl to cancel my order and I will take my money elsewhere. I don't know who manages or owns this Burger King, but they need to fire everyone and start from scratch. I will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"Service is slower than any other fast food place I've ever tried. Waited at drive through window for at least 10 minutes, they came to the window 3 times apologizing for the delay, finally got the food. Didn't order much, burger, wrap sand onion rings so not sure what took so long? Food was ok at best but the onion rings were way too salty."}
{"text":"Poor service slow staff and they want u to pay for sauce! Don't recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"Where to start cold hard nuggets and cumin filled bbq sauce?  hard bun lukewarm patty stale soda and an attitude to boot this was my 3rd try and fail this was lunch time so why is it not fresh i thank you for your try but failed me sorry to say."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting!!!  Tried to re-serve food that was incorrectly served to, and touched by, another patron, and was then subsequently rifled through by the employee that mis-served it.   After being called out, the employee tried to deny that she had done it, and management refunded the money, and SWORE, that nothing like that would ever happen again.   When asked how he could insure that, he shrugged his shoulders, told me that the money had been returned, and that I could have a good day...knowing too well that no reprimand, training, or further influence would be put upon the offending employee.   I know it's fast food, and that you get what you pay for, but I grew up working in a similar restaurant to earn money when I was a kid.  We took pride back then. I actually think this is a comment about the nature of the new work force.  Quite shocking and disappointing, even for a low level fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was alright, its Burger king so you should know what you are getting, nothing bad it was decent. On the plus side this location is large and pretty clean,  staff could use a bit work in customer service but it was alright  Took the guy at cash a bit of time to notice me but other then that no issue with my order  Also, 10 nuggets for 1.99 is back"}
{"text":"As a fast food joint my expectations are not high, but when you give me cool, somewhat soggy onion rings and a cold whopper dang!  I love the onion ring sauce and am convinced they put cocaine in it.  That saved my otherwise lackluster meal.  Also, the drive through was fast.  There, I said something nice."}
{"text":"Standard Burger King really. Has a nice drive thru and large parking lot. I also like that the entrance is at a traffic light so you never have to wait forever to make a left turn."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BURGER KING FOOT LETTUCE ACTUAL LOCATION. This is where the burger foot lettuce meme originated. Here at this Burger King the picture was taken of a man standing on lettuce that is served to people."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible place I ordered a medium hash brown the lady sounded like I was bothering her when I went through the drive thru second they gave me a small hashbrown third I asked for ketchup they gave me one and my hashbrown had dog/ cat hair on it wtf I'm livid with the poor customer service"}
{"text":"Reina (not sure on the spelling of her name), gave excellent customer service through the drive thru. Great, lasting, professional customer service."}
{"text":"Every time I write a Fast Food review an Angel cries. LOL  The food here is typical BK faire. But BK has upped their game with better offering and have even added Hot Dogs. Venture Capital firm 3G of Brazil and Warren Buffett have brought in some smart people to improve the business.   What I found to be hilarious while I was munching down my lunch, was their multiple TVs were tuned to Dr Oz's \"Total 10 Rapid Weight Loss Plan\" on Fox10 AZ. What message were they sending I wonder?  LOL  The food, the service and the employees here are all great. However, local Fox TV and Dr. Oz. LOL.   I did not experience any of the short comings that others experienced. Lunch ran me $6.26."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and the customer service is top notch. Very nice to have a place to stop by on the way home and have such courteous people to help me satisfy my stomachs desires."}
{"text":"I went there to get dinner for the family. The girl at the drive thru window gave me the order and 1 was missing. She said I didn't order 4 meals, so I ordered another one. Got home and saw that she did charge me for 4 meals and I had now paid for 5. Went back to talk to a manager, he came up to register as if I was an inconvenience, explained the story. Showed him my bank statement showing charges and receipts. The girl is standing there laughing. The manager does not say sorry. He goes to drive thru register and the girl is whispering and laughing even more now. He hands me cash, which I would've rather had it back on my card, still no sorry. I've emailed this location and the main cooperation and have never gotten a response. I refuse to spend a dime there. As an owner I'd be upset with the lack of customer service and that's all I wanted to tell them is they should retrain on customer service and how to give excellent service."}
{"text":"Typical Burger King stuff ~  Workers are decent and friendly enough, though could use more smiles.  Hits and misses with the orders since I customize my orders and they sometimes don't end up customizing it.  Drinks are okay, never asked for a refill before though.. does it apply to BK? Hmmm.  Decor could use some upgrading since this place has been here for quite some time and the colours are starting to wear out. As well as the work place itself. Everything seems very old and dull. The walking space is pretty tight too and not fit for baby carriages or strollers or old folks with walking aids.   Never used the washrooms here but you need an employee to unlock it for you before you use it. It is kind of a hassle and they dont notify that to customers so some customers are actually left confused because they think its for employees or something...  Overall; just a typical BK with decent food. I always get onion rings from BK, love them! Instead of a Whopper, you can probably get away with a Whopper Jr by paying less. :)"}
{"text":"The worst BK ever. Never not once have I got what I ordered at the drive up, wrong stuff missing stuff I ordered a double cheese burger plain what I got was two burger patties no cheese no bun got charged for a double cheese burger that was the never ever again trip. Go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Just came by rn for lunch the drive thru clerk was so rude didnt let us finish when we where ordering and scolded us like little kids for using a coupon !  If your employee is getting upset cause people are going to use them dont send them out and my husband was still apologizing to the man as if my husband did something wrong! And then to give us our food wrong! Yeah gave yall a third chance now we will no longer come here. Its worth to drive 5 more minutes and get better service on 35 ave  good luck to whoever owns this establishment"}
{"text":"I would normally never write a review on a burger king, i rarely ever even go to a burger king, but i went last night after work, just after midnight, i ordered a 10 piece nuggets and some bacon cheese burger off the value menu, the nuggets of corse, were as expected for just over 1$, mediocre, thin, but filled me up, BUT the burger, upon opening the wrapper, it looked as if a 5 star chef had crafted it, picture perfect in every way, like you would see on TV or on a picture poster, i was shocked that a burger, from burger king, at almost 1 AM looked like this, i sat there in awe at this amazing piece of art, then taking a bite, it tasted perfect, onion, pickle bacon and lettuce, all crisp, burger warm and char broiled, bun just soft enough, blown away, by a value meal burger, it goes to show, someone that night, making my burger, actually gave a shit about the costumer, without even seeing my face, my thanks to the person who crafted such a beautiful burger."}
{"text":"This rating is specific to lunch.  Yes, this is fast food.  Yes, it's downtown.  So the experience is what you would expect in a big city, downtown, fast food location.  But the reason I rate this two stars is they can't seem to handle a lunch rush with good speed."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place, but they are slooooooooow. The food is adequate (please don't lecture me about fast food, why are you even reading this review?), but sitting at the drive-in will shorten your life. Or maybe just feel like it.   I prefer some of their stuff to McDonald's (yes, I'm very discerning) but just cannot abide the wait."}
{"text":"Food took forever to come out; even though I was in the drive through.  Had it been the chicken I would have understood....it was the fries!  After all of the suspense, it tasted horrible.  Ended up tossing it and grabbing Jack in the Box instead."}
{"text":"Since their redo, I have been loving this place.  I noticed their staff has improved and with their awesome pricing, for get about it!!!  Not normally a BK kind of a guy but this location has began to sway me."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give less than 1 star, I would do it. I ordered carry-out, 2 double cheeseburgers plain. The lady at the register repeated my order back to me and I paid and received my receipt.   i stood back and waited for 12 minutes, ( I timed this with my cell phone ) and still had no order yet. Finally after taking care of 2 more customers who came in after I did, she handed me a bag and told me that my order was ready.  I sat down at a table to look at the burgers and instead of my order, I received 2 double hamburgers with everything.  I took the burgers back to the counter and told her that she gave me the wrong items. She looked confused and took the burgers and threw them in the trash and asked me what my original order was. I told her 2 double cheeseburgers plain!!! And asked if she needed to see my receipt.  At this time, a male employee who was working the drive-thru came over and yelled my order to the staff in the back.  This time, I did receive the requested burgers, but upon checking again to make sure the order was correct, the patties were noticeably smaller than the original burgers that I had been given by mistake in the first place. If management cares about this store, they really need to do some serious training!  Btw, I managed a store for 8 years back in the 80's so I know how things are supposed to go! I have contacted the customer response site and am awaiting a reply from the manager, after which I want a face-to-face meeting with management to discuss this and other improper actions that I observed going on!"}
{"text":"My bbq bacon king burger was dry, tasted burnt and the soda machine stinks soooooo bad.  I waited $2.29 On a drink.  My friends bacon is waaayyy over cooked. It was like eating tree bark. I don't even trust the burger, but I'm not wasting all the money I spent on food.  I will not ever come back."}
{"text":"Lady operating the drive through at 2:41P.m 5/6/17 was very impatient. I had a suv full of people and im doing one at a time. I got 2 items and before i can get tge third item she states \"that\" completes your order. X number of dollars at tge window.  I refuse to so buisness anywhere where i cant complete my order......."}
{"text":"I happen to live near this Burger King. I never hesitate to go this location because employees are super nice. The lady I see in the morning almost always is kind and provide a good customer service. :)"}
{"text":"I go to this location before I head to work. People are nice here. Coffee is not great but then it's fast food so. I'm pretty satisfied!"}
{"text":"Visited on 04/19/16 at 12pm. Management and staff are VERY accommodating.  Upbeat, clean and friendly atmosphere.  Witnessed the manager on duty defusing an angry customer and she was calm and professional.  The result was that the customer left happy.  This location should be the the company standard when it comes to customer care and service.  Great job team!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest fast food places I have ever experienced.  There was no one in line behind me or ahead of me.  No one was going through the drive through and the one guy that wasn't in the back or using the bathroom, literally walked in as if he was in slow motion to do everything!  For some reason he was picking out individual fries from the fryer and laying them down ( in slow motion mind you) one by one on the side of the fryer I guess to check if they were done.  There were like ten fries laying on the fryer.  So weird! I would not come back here."}
{"text":"Customer service was pretty bad. Staff was too loud to make an order and the food was sub par. I was hoping for a nice fresh lunch and was very disappointed. The lettuce was brown, patties were rubbery and cold. ."}
{"text":"I have not been to Burger King, McDonald or any place like this in YEARS, but we had a short window to eat before a movie and my husband was HUNGRY!!  We both ordered a whopper combo.  Service was prompt (thus the fast food) and there was a large variety of drink options. Surprisingly, the food taste was better than anticipated but everything was COLD. The cheese didn't even begin to melt, the burger was cold, fries were cold...  Also, there was a closed for cleaning sign on the women's restroom the entire time we were there, with no one actually cleaning the restroom."}
{"text":"Well this location got a bit of a face lift since I was last there but overall the design still look the same.  This BK is at corner of birchmount and ellesmere with it own drive through it is pretty convient location to hit.  Its not a small store so seating is plenty if you sit down to eat.  Food is pretty standard as you would expect. It is Burger King and there food is decent, i havent found anything too offensive with there food.  Service was fairly quick and didnt wait long for my food so that a plus.  They also have wifi which is a nice plus and the various deals that Bk has going on is nice like 2 for 5 buck sandwich or 10 nuggets for 2 dollars. All and all its good"}
{"text":"Right on the corner of Front and George street, this location is fairly new, only being open in last year and its across from a Mcds that has been there forever so I dont know how wise it was to open there but I think Mcds has some competiton  This BK still has whooper wednesday deals that I havent seen around in a few other location topped with 10 chicken nugget for 2 buck, I think BK has overall the edge price wise, but I usually hit BK because I like their breakfast sandwiches more then Mcds and if im around on wednesday.  Thou it seem interesting to note that this place recently added a make shift ramp since prior to it, the building had this issue. Guess enough complaints for this change but i think it fault of designer for not having one as well as diagonal door entrance, just looks odd."}
{"text":"Burger King is a good alternative for.... (fill in the blank).     Their broiling of burgers offers a distinctive taste and for the most part the food and service is good.  This particular location is convenient to FLW and Shea Blvd and we have found their employees to be very nice."}
{"text":"Alright! I can hear the groans but give me a second. I have Burger King app & I got the dble cheeseburger, hold the catsup, add mayo. I love this sandwich. The French fries are great. $3.00 is a super deal."}
{"text":"While I typically enjoy going to Burger King in general, this location seems to not have their act together as much as I would typically want.  I went to this location's drive through one day and requested 2 cheeseburgers plain and a regular coke.  When I drove around to the window to pay and pickup my food, I was given 2 cheeseburgers with onions and other items on it and the coke ended up being a cherry coke.  When I drove back around to the speaker to tell the lady what happened, instead of fixing my order through the drive through, I was asked to come inside to have the order fixed.  So I parked my car and went inside the restaurant only to have to wait in line again to speak with someone.  My order was eventually fixed, but I have experienced numerous times with this location problems with order accuracy.  The quality of the food however does meet my expectations for a fast food establishment and is quite enjoyable when the order is right."}
{"text":"This place lately does not have large lids for drinks that get annoying they keep telling us they will get them they will it has been like 4 weeks"}
{"text":"It's BK... Nothing special.   Most times there are cranky teenagers working. I will say they do forget things or when asked a question the return is usually with an eye roll."}
{"text":"They have the best service, my order took only 2 mins to be prepared. Usually a chicken sandwich takes more than 4 mins to be prepared."}
{"text":"It took over 30 minutes to get my order. I went in and ordered,maybe that was my mistake, maybe the drive thru would have been more efficient.  My order number was never called. I went to the counter twice to check  and finally got my order. Like they completely forgot my order or me. So frustrating, it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero if I could.  Disgusting and ridiculous.  We went through the drive thru and had to pull to the side and wait 10 minutes for our food.  They brought our food out and it was wrong.  I went in to fix it (you don't know me but I am really nice and will not bring food back or complain)  she off the bat was super rude.  She took our bag of food, started going through it with no gloves on and  asked  \"what's wrong?\"  I told her \"we ordered original chicken sandwiches and they gave us the chicken sandwiches off of the dollar menu\" and I continued listing everything else the kids ordered and she said \"so you only need the chicken sandwiches fixed\".  I said \"yes but we didn't order fries and there are fries in there and an extra burger etc\".  She pulled up our order on their screen and continued to look through the bag and what we ordered. She set our bag down by the drive-through window and then they gave it to somebody going through the drive-through after I had already gone through it and she went through it also (remind you with no gloves on). Then she came over to me seconds later and gives me just two original chicken sandwiches, nothing else that was in our order.  Knowing our bag went out the drive thru window to someone else, I asked \"where is the rest?\" She said \"you said you only need the chicken sandwiches\". I laughed and said \"you pulled up our order on the screen, so why are there only two chicken sandwiches?\" She said \"you said you only need the two chicken sandwiches\""}
{"text":"I confess, of all the fast food burger joints. The Whopper at Burger King is my favorite. Sue me :-) So they're running this 2 for $6 special. I ordered 1 Whopper, the High School dropout behind the counter told me that would be $4.59. Say what? If 2 are $6...Shouldn't 1 be $3? Sounds like a Seinfeld episode."}
{"text":"This is by far the worsest Burger King I ever been  The staff is horrible management I don't see anybody the same person that takes your order and your money  Is the same person that put your food in the back and handed to you without washing his hands if there is less than one star I would give it to them do not go there this will be my last time"}
{"text":"If you come here to dine in close to closing time DO NOT sit in the back section or you will get scolded by the Latina hussie behind the counter."}
{"text":"I was here and I ordered a large drink and a large strawberry smoothie. I got my cup right away but it literally took them 30 minutes to get my smoothie. My girlfriend said she'd wait for me so I can go eat and my food so it wouldn't get cold. The staff was working hard but they were so slow. A man came charging in from outside saying he was in his truck for an hour waiting and then another man started complaining saying he waited over 45 minutes for his burger and fries. I don't write reviews unless they're exceptionally great or really really bad and I'm so pissed with Burger King right now that id rather just eat at McDonald's for the rest of my life whenever I want fast food."}
{"text":"This location is understaffed, under-trained, mis-managed if not completely neglected, unreasonably slow, and over-priced!  Avoid this location.   Example of price differences:  Large Onion Rings @ this location: $ 3.29 + tax  Large Onion Rings at the BK @ 7th Street & Bell Road: $ 2.49 + tax"}
{"text":"This is the worst place you could possibly go to get food. Place is run by convicts who were placed here to have a job. You can tell they really don't care how fast they get your food out.  They are constantly out of Whoppers especially on SUNDAYS AT LUNCHTIME. Part of me thinks they just don't want to serve people. Whoever is in change of this place needs to be fired. They don't even clean the place."}
{"text":"Ate here two nights ago. I got food poisoning from the value double cheeseburgers . Literally have been throwing up paired with diarrhea for two days.. Never coming here again. Food quality has really gone downhill. Train your workers to label food and not cross contaminate . Thank you"}
{"text":"Worst Burger King experience at this location. Waited over 20 minutes for our food and it wasn't even hot or fresh. Tried to give them our food back but was given a small refund cause we ate some fries. Customer service needs a lot of attention and they need to learn to clean the dinning area. Wish I could give zero stars."}
{"text":"LAS has quite a few restaurants to choose from however, if you are looking for something quick, this is for you. It is a Burger King, so they have the regular menu offered by your local BK restaurant.  The service was quick, and there was enough seating for us to enjoy our meal without having to eat in the terminal. It is located across from gate E 10 in terminal 3.  The food was hot, and they have a small self serve beverage station featuring Coke products. The only thing different than the other Burger Kings is the price. Expect to pay $12 for a whopper value meal which is very high, but then again you are in the Las Vegas airport. Decent food, high prices. Three stars"}
{"text":"I hate to give this BK a 2-star review - I really, really do, because the folks I have encountered in the drive-thru and dine-in have been exceptionally friendly.  However, the food is definitely meh.  For a drive-thru dinner, the chicken sandwich was fair - a little light on the mayo and heavy on the lettuce.  Fries were a little soggy.  For a dine-in breakfast, the young lady assisting was very, very nice, but my 2 for $3 ham and cheese crossanwiches were YUCK.  The ham was burned around the edges, so it tasted like coal.  The cheese was super melty, so the sandwich pretty much fell apart the minute I bit into it.  I ate one but could not force myself to eat even part of the second.  I was in a crunch for time, so just went on my way and struck BK off of my list for fast food breakfast stops near home.  Breakfast gets a 1, dinner gets a 2."}
{"text":"This Burger King has been in Agincourt Mall as long as I can remember and honestly it hasnt really changed, well maybe ownship. The older chinese guy who I think was the manager or owner is gone and I think it a Black lady who is manager but I remember her from past she has been there a while so maybe it hasnt  The  appearance is the same, the service is fairly quick  even with a long line especially one wednesday but we know all BK location mass premake there whoopers as you can usually see 4-5 waiting to be order which is why I either get cheese or scratch the tomatoes for a fresh burger.   Washroom use to be open but I guess too many people from mall coming to use their washroom? I dont know, so staff have to open it as well they have crack down on food from outside. I was once in line to order food and i have Tim Horton coffee in my hand and told me that I couldnt bring that in here. I  explained that im not taking a table to drink it or eating pizza here but it didnt matter. I ended up leaving while in line.   That was one odd and stupid experience but it been decent for most of time. Its BK so i think we know to expect someone good food and semi quick service and bam that it."}
{"text":"I have not been a fan of BK for many years, but I had not been to one in a few years so because they sent out some BYGO coupons I decided to give them a try again. The Whoppers my friend and I got were both burnt to a crisp. Both the meat and the buns were blackened. The fries tasted very strange, and were not hot at all.    Never again."}
{"text":"It's a Burger King...enough said?   Decor: out dated, was clearly built and designed in the early 90s   Cleanliness: this is where they gotta improve...all the tables have some sort of crap on them. Ketchup drops or salt and pickles -- something or the other. Get out there and clean your tables and seats more often.   Staff: adequate? They take your order and then give it you.  Food: the whopper juniors were tasty enough (7/10). Fries tasted a by cold/stale (4/10)."}
{"text":"My greeting \"what can I get you?\" After paying \"do you want your change?\" Someone in the back screaming \"O' shit!\" Cold fries and watered down ketchup...really? Lookout 'JACK' here I come."}
{"text":"Give me all my food in 1 bag, get home step out the car and the bag falls apart, all my food on the ground. Awesome... thanks for filling up the 1 bag with everything and ruining my night. That's why you just put it in 2 bags instead of stuffing one and the photo below doesn't even show the other half of the food on the ground"}
{"text":"Gross. Terrible service. Untrained and lazy employees. Someone call the owners on this location. Wack as hell experience. Couldn't eat the food. Inedible."}
{"text":"Bring back the whopper!!!!  Kiding . Alway`s good."}
{"text":"I was flying out of Charlotte and I decided I wanted a proper burger. So I make my way over to Burger King. Order my self a whopper meal. Medium and a diet soda to wash it all down.  The pretty lady at the counter tells me how much I owe her. I hand her my credit card, she swipes and hands me a receipt with my order number on it. I grab myself a soda and proceeded to the waiting section. A few minutes after, they call my number, I pick up my food and off to my gate we go.  My experience was actually very pleasant. I came for food, I got food, I ate and I was satisfied. No bad experiences, no drama, no violent reactions. I would buy my whopper sandwiches here again and again and again and again.  Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after work and ordered a veggie burger and large fry without mayo. Then I pulled up to pay. The girl who took my order and the married employee she was working with were flirting the whole time on her phone and barely said a word to me when I pulled up. After about a five minute wait, I received my burger. I did not receive the toppings I ordered on my burger so pulled  BACK around to tell the girl at the window. She didn't even so much as apologize and asked what I ordered again, so they could correct my already-made burger, rather than prepare me a new one. After they fixed my burger and I checked for spit, I became infuriated at the service and meal I just pid $6.40 for.   So I called in and spoke with the manager, John, who apologized tremendously, told me he would talk to his employee, and assured me a free meal for the inconvenience. If it weren't for him, this review would easily have one star. Step up ya game, Lincoln BK!"}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this place a star.. Worst customer service ever..  The girl at the drive thru was extremely rude.. When I pulled up she was shaking her head as if I was bothering her. I never come to fast food places and this is just another reason why.. Food is shit and customer service blows."}
{"text":"I hate when anyone lies to your face..I ordered a double whopper with cheese off the broiler because I want my food fresh, not sitting in a steamer pan..I stood and watched him for about 5 mins pulling the meat out of the pan for all the orders...He didn't take mine off the broiler like I asked. When I told the crew leader, he ask the guy if it was off the broiler and he said they all come off the broiler...???? I told him I watched him take it out of the pan...I don't like soggy meat..."}
{"text":"Improvement on customer service and order accuracy asked for ranch didn't get any. Waiting for our food for the drive through, didn't get a receipt for our sale. Just got home and my son ordered bacon king junior got home and he got double cheeseburgers."}
{"text":"I live only a couple blocks away and have enjoyed going to this burger king since 2009 it was Sad when it burnt down but they rebuild it...only took them a year to finally do anything with the destroyed building. now I come here about once a month, It has been consistently good for me."}
{"text":"I like to recognize a company when they take action to improve their customer service and I must say ~This Burger King has changed my mind! I went back a month ago and then again last week and the service was so much better, very big improvement! So kudos to you all~ I will be eating here more often!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty average BK, in a great neighborhood with a decent staff.  In the burger wars, I think both BK and McD's lose out to Wendy's for sure! But, this BK's inside isn't nearly as nice as their McD's down the street.  Today I didn't want to triple Whopper it, so I got their classic \"crispy\" chicken sandwich. Only problem it wasn't crispy....but still tasty, and not as heavy as a Whopper.   Staff is always friendly here.....smiling, calling me hon, sweetie and sugar. LOL.  Overall not a bad fast food option when you're needing that gut grenade at 2am!"}
{"text":"Bathrooms are always dirty and there is no changing pad. Last time I went there, the bathroom was out of hand soap and they refused to get me more. Seriously. The guy behind the register said he couldn't leave the register if he had customers (because I wasn't one), and he couldn't ask anyone else to get some hand soap, because he couldn't leave the register. And I had three small children with me too. Beyond comprehension. Needless to say, we will never be back."}
{"text":"Horrific experience, I ordered a chicken sandwich and literally got a sandwich with a piece of chicken in it and nothing else. This place needs to shut down immediately, I have never seen worst customer service"}
{"text":"Came ehre cause I was craving a whopper and with their 2/5$ whopper deal, how can you turn that down.  Easily located right off Rainbow, however in an empty deserted shopping center, this location is usually very consistent and quick with their service. I would agree, the food is pretty typical fast food Burger King and they dont put a lot of effort when they make the items. Why is it that all the items at any fast food (not just here) looks like it was just thrown together in the most haphazard way. Makes the food non appetizing. But hey when you are craving something, you gotta hit the craving no matter how the food looks.  Really good customer service here though. Angeee really helped me out when I went through drive-through and I noticed my order was wrong. I ended up having to go back through the drive through one more time as she told me to wait in the parking lot while she brought out my order. She walked the food pipping hot to my car and was so nice and apologetic about it. Couldnt have been happier!"}
{"text":"The person that waited on me tonight acted as if waiting on me was putting her out.  If BK keeps this person on they may lose customers. Tonight wasn't the first time she had an attitude."}
{"text":"Slow!  Breakfast on a Saturday was very slow. Drive through line was huge. Nice clean BK"}
{"text":"Oh where can I start... ( you know it's bad when a review starts like that) well first of all drive thru is horrible and disgusting! A lady by the name Sonia was very rude when I brought up that the drive thru was dirty. She said she has to wait for a manager to clean it up! Really?? Why don't you get you go outside and clean it yourself to make your manger proud! Will never go here again and will be sending a letter to the corporate store #16422"}
{"text":"As fast food and BKs go, this is a great one. Very friendly staff and the food is typical BK which, although horrible for the health is, I believe, delicious."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars, me and my boyfriend just came to this location and I'll never go back. When we pulled up to the drive thru speaker we waited way to long for someone to greet us and even after we were greeted we had to say hello several times to get someone to respond to us (mind you there was no customers in the building or other cars in the parking lot so...? He ordered onion rings instead of fries with his food because he does not like Burger King fries at all. We were asked to pull around and once she brings us our food we look in the bag and notice that they had put 4 cold and old onion rings on top of a order fries and I can only assume to hope we didn't notice til we would return home and by that time we wouldn't care bc they were to lazy to drop some onion rings in a fryer and cook them. Well we noticed, and also his burger was the wrong burger with no sauce on it at all. And when we asked her about the onion rings and fries she tried to lie and say \"yeah they're mixed in together\" ??? Why would you mix fries and onion rings in someone's order when they didn't even ask for them, no you were fucking lazy and put 4 old onion rings on top of a order and fries and hoped we didn't notice. And then she said \"what? You want more onion rings?\" With a attitude. Like yes?! Because that's what we ordered.... I've never seen such stupidity in my life, so rude, lied to our face, and gave us the wrong food on purpose to save her from doing minute more work. God forbid right? Like I said they weren't busy it wasn't 10 minutes to close I've worked in fast food before it's not rocket science... will never return to this Burger King again. It was almost comical how bad the whole situation was. Do better."}
{"text":"I wanted a quick breakfast item this particular morning ... And since it'd been longer than a year since I'd had breakfast at BK I decided to run through the drive-thru.  I chose a double croissanwich. I took a picture of it on my dashboard and uploaded to yelp. The croissant was somewhere between average and slightly better than average. The scrambled egg I thought was pretty good. The sausage wasn't marvelous as it seemed as if it was nuked. Which I think a lot of the BK menu is comprised of pre-cooked component pieces that are quickly nuked to give some heat to it. And bacon.. to me .. everything is better with bacon. This bacon was pretty crispy. I prefer mine just a little chewy. Tasty bacon ... but more crunchy than I'd like for a sandwich.   Sooooo ... in general ... Not the way above average food I'm accustomed to. Not the worst. Somewhere around average. The price of this sandwich was more than normal for what I'd expect for a premium breakfast sandwich .. It wasn't as good as the price.  2 stars."}
{"text":"This place is ran by methheads. I had to pull forward  for a basic order of 3 meals. After a 13min wait outside I got down only to find 3 employees outrageously laughing by the register counter. The manager was out the back door smoking and my food was just sitting there on the warmer. When I asked for my order one meth head responded with \"its not ready\", but all it needs were the 3 drinks. Then the toothless broad yells at the manager to come pour drinks,  As if she was the bully in the building. What a depressing situation for these employees who are incompetent and have no aspirations to grow into a better quality of life. Save yourself the time and hassle"}
{"text":"It started pretty good - the order taker was friendly and fast, I paid and was asked to pull around to the front because my food was being prepared. I went to the drive through - so came home before eating (to the apartments less than a block from the store - so not far).    First, the burgers were barely room temperature. They were crusty and crunchy on the outside and so not fresh or warm that the cheese didn't melt. There was kind of a smear of mayo on less than half of the sandwich - the rest was bone dry.  I requested heavy pickle (it was on the screen and on the ticket) but there were no pickles on the sandwich at all.  It was absolutely horrible.  My nuggets were fresh and hot, but had an off-putting smell. I originally thought they'd accidentally given me onion rings - but it was just the chicken that smelled like onion rings.   Overall terrible experience. Second time at this store (usually I don't even get a receipt to submit the survey!) so I doubt I'll be back to this location. Maybe there's a Burger King near work where I can get my flame broiled cravings satisfied, but I don't think I'll be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Is there any rating less then 1 available?  Stopped in about 215 ish through the drive thru. I started my order by saying I have a coupon for a whopper meal for 2 for 8.99. The person proceeded to ask for size and what to drink. I gave her my answer. I had started the order by saying I have a coupon because of how rude they were last time I used a coupon and didn't say anything prior to getting to the window and this time I did. So I get to the window and the girl says next time say you have a coupon and I told her I did. She gets mad and has someone else hand the order out the window and gets mad when she sends me on my way without my drinks. Horrible customer service. Only reason I stop here because it's closest to my house and convenient. Not the first time this happens really want to contact the store owner I'm sure they don't know how their employees are acting."}
{"text":"Ordered a double whooper with cheese which is my usual when I rarely eat at Burger King. The food was good but the ambience was quite ghetto. I walked in to an old man in a wheelchair asking people for change as they came in. While I was waiting on line to order my food some 13 year old giant decided to play jungle gym on the line queue cattle guards. It was very annoying considering he was less than 2 feet away from me. The cashier was very friendly and took my order promptly, my food was ready within 5 minutes. Overall the food was good but the location as said earlier was ghetto. Undesirables shuffling in and out that weren't customers, not to mention the 300+ pound female sitting at the table directly across from me with her asscrack showing."}
{"text":"I love BK, but this particular one is not very good service-wise. Almost every time I'm there I have to wait for nearly 15-20 minutes for my food! It's ridiculous"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD.  The quality of the food isn't like any other burger king.  There doing something wrong and they don't care.   Do yourself a favor people, read everyone else's post ' pretty similar."}
{"text":"Okay i was super hungry when i walked in, so i expected like the usual, 5, 6min wait on my order, but the princesses in the front were to busy making their orders from del taco and writing them to one of the coworkers who was going to get it for them, they LITERALLY forgot to serve the food to 3 of the order which one of them was mine, then after 15 min ridiculous wait i asked if my order was ready they were like: what did u get? \" seriously???? They looked into my ticket and were like ohh okay, then i asked for a sauce,  she throws it in the platter!!! The worst costumer service ever, they messed orders and ppl started to get angry, these girls should not do costumer service."}
{"text":"Wish I could leave zero stars, I want to specifically mention the manager MARTHA. I come to this Burger King very very often but now I'm going to find somewhere else to eat because when I was inside the resteraunt ordering food today, the manager was extremely rude shouting across the store (making all the customers uncomfortable) at a homeless man for filling up a cup he brought in himself saying she would call metro and even turned off the soda machine so all the CUSTOMERS had to ask in order to get a drink. Then about 10 minutes later another homeless man that she seemed to know came in and she turned on the fountain for him and let him fill his own cup. Not only did I see horrible worth ethic but but almost every single table was dirty and the place just looked trashed on the inside. Now that I know the morals of the people who work here I won't even be going through the drive again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I was so hungry that I still ate the poorly served food I received. I ordered the Whopper combo with no onion. Both my sandwich and fries were served barely warm. The cashier staff was very friendly. The seating area was not clean, a liquid spill was on the floor with no sign, several tables were not wiped down. I was very disappointed in the quality of food I received but I will give them another chance."}
{"text":"The absolute worst ! 10 min in the drive thru, then they take 2 others before me and then the worst attitudes at the window and to top it off I had pull around in front and wait another 10 for the Food! That store needs new management and crew they suck! We will never go back to that one. It's a shame because it's right in my neighborhood. Terrible place and worst experience at any burger king."}
{"text":"Staff here is always cheerful, food is always decent and usually fresh. I don't frequent fast food, but it's good here."}
{"text":"Out of BUFFALO SAUCE for the chicken melt BUFFALO Sandwhich WHAAAAAA this Sandwhich is what I crave when aunt flow comes to visit!"}
{"text":"They only gave me 1 bbq and the buffalo sauce had a hole in it. Wtf bruh but the nuggets are bomb"}
{"text":"GROSS!!!DON'T EAT HERE!!! UNLESS YOU WANT FOOD POISONING!!! Sarah and Dave think it's ok to have food sitting on the counter for long periods of time and serve it to customers!!! NOT ONE thing they gave me was warm!!! It's been on the counter for how long before I got here???NOT even under the heat lamps...jus on counter...see pictures. Yes they offered to remake it but only with a attitude. (Sarah) Sarah goes on to tell me that corp.want them to have par levels of certain products. Then I just asked for my money back...again got that with attitude  (Sarah) I started to take pictures of the food just sitting there and she started to yell at me that I can't take pictures. Know the law!!! :)  I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!!!! WORST SERVICE!!!! SARAH AND DAVE TERRIBLE FOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"Waited at the counter for 15 minutes for someone to take my order and ended up just walking out. Very unorganized and a very bad example of customer service. Definitely will not be back to this location"}
{"text":"By far the worst burger king ever. It's always a long wait in line or something is broken or ran out! The food is always cold! There is nothing worst than eating a cold burger when BK is known for broiling. I no longer come here."}
{"text":"Notice: Your workers are closing the burger King over 30 minutes early. I get off work late. I always get into town 30 min before you close so I try and get a bite to eat. They repeatedly close over 30 min early."}
{"text":"This burger King has its good days and bad days, however I've definitely seen more bad. The employees aren't the nicest. In fact I've been made fun of before through the drive thru. The food isn't always hot either. This store did just get remodeled and replaced their drink machine with one of those that can fuse flavors into sodas so hopefully it will improve further."}
{"text":"Omg!!! Everything so slow. There were about 7 ppl working... but 3 people wait in line forever.   I ordered the big fish combo. The fries was cold and the fish was burned. Also there was no lettuces in side.   I talked to one of the employee. He was nice and offered me a new order. But it ended up taking me another 10 mins to wait for. Nobody make it when he asked two times... finally he just went in and had it on his hand. Maybe he just went in and made it by himself."}
{"text":"I had horrible service here. There used to be a manager named Anita who was disrespectful repeatedly. She charged me .25 cents for a grape jelly. Every time I went there, Anita was rude and nasty. I haven't ever gone back since."}
{"text":"I was here today.... lots of parking out front.  Inside it was standard BK fare, key differences here though.... great friendly service, FAST, and very clean dining room.  It was quite busy over the lunch hour, but it didnt affect the speed of service. Only downside... the drink and condiment station was somewhat small and did get a bit backed up. Other than that, it was a good cheap and cheerful lunch. Long live the king! LOL"}
{"text":"Yeahhhhh, this location needs some customer service overhaul. Corporate should spend more money on training and quality hires then fancy building improvements. You can shine an old penny but guess what... It's still only worth one cent. #burgerking"}
{"text":"The customer service was awesome.. But the burger was luke warm almost cold. Why is it that most if not all Burger King burgers are this way. I was fooled thinking that since the airport is busy and lots of people purchasing. The burger would at least be hot. Thank god my onion rings where hot, because This whooper meal was $13.09...a waste of money."}
{"text":"It's a Burger King. So, nothing really stands out. The staff was friendly and fast, but the restaurant was pretty much empty. It's not usually my first place when I want fast food, but this Burger King is right next to La Baie. Whenever I go shopping, it's easier to stop here. I don't always like to eat at the mall food courts.   This place does serve some really cheap ice cream though, and it's pretty good. If anything, for the summer it'll be a nice spot to stop for ice cream."}
{"text":"ordered 3 orders nuggets , 2 whopper meals . asked for fresh frys, receipt states off broiler and they are cold and soggy, both of them. whopper I asked for both to have cheese, well I got charged for one burger to get 2 slices. called manager , now I gotta drive this crap back to them after im home cause they cant simply read the screen? Seems they don't pay attention to your order and have no care. another place that wasted my money and time. Can't even eat the whoppers cause they not even fresh."}
{"text":"asked for fresh frys get old frys, 2md Time this happen. and didn't give a receipt.lets hope my burger eatable cause the frys are NOT. Edit this cause I just had a bite of my burger. horrible .. threw the whole meal away. wasted $8 thanks burger king"}
{"text":"Yikes!  Perhaps the soggiest, worst onion rings on the planet.  Otherwise a simply meh experience.  There's a little seating area on one side of the place.  There are many good options at the airport, and this Burger King is among the poorest choices imoho."}
{"text":"Hours online said they where opened til 11 but when we arrived at 9:58 they promptly turned off the drive thru lights without any explanation of why they closed. Also an employee saw us in the drive thru and did not tell us they where closed. overall a very negative experience and will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"this is the best Burger King I have gone to. I visit this location once every couple months."}
{"text":"this is the best Burger King I have gone to. I visit this location once every couple months."}
{"text":"The bun on my whopper jr was hard as rock. Chicken fries were also dry and hard. Service was good and the restaurant was clean. Sad the food was so bad."}
{"text":"For those of you who did not think that the westside could not exist in Rhodes Ranch, then you clearly have not been to this burger king location. Right off the bat walking in you could see that coke, Dr pepper, hi-c, and zesty sauce were all out.  Not a good sign but we took the gamble anyway. The onion rings were cold and had more leather than an old boot. The whopper was not our way!! It was their way and looked like it had been dragged through a cat's litterbox!! The chicken sandwich looked like it belonged on dirty dining. But hey, it probably tastes like chicken. Meanwhile both on and off the clock employees continued social media hour at the front counter taking selfies and shucking and jiving for all those to see and hear. The only bright spot at this location is Latonya who is a 50 something year old women trying to do the job the correct way. She was nice enough to remake the order and get the food right. However it's unfortunate that she spends most of the shift babysitting teens than customer service. We choked down what we could of the meal and then to put the cherry on top of the miserable evening, we had to race home because Montezuma's revenge set in. And that's nothing but the truth... so help me.. you know the rest..."}
{"text":"Burger was cold as ice people don't bother coming in here at least not at night it was so awful I puked these people don't know how to take your order my husband had to tell the girl getting the order 5 times and when we got our order it was so cold not even the cheese would melt on the patty and the bread ohhhh myyyy God it was cold and hard as a rock the cook was on her cell phone while making the burger and the girl taking the order look like Medusa with her  hair all the way to the ceiling and I all wanted was a good quality hot mustard cheese burger Bk on Durango and Sahara Las Vegas Nevada you need to get your employees in check please and I am glad Medusa was not handling food because she kept picking her nose that was gross after that I puked. SO PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION IT IS TERRIBLE BUT IF YOU WANT COLD ASS BURGERS SERVED BY SOMETHING FROM CLASH OF THE TITANS THEN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone else's expectations for this place are way too high. They've never gotten my order wrong and they've always been fast. Besides. Who even looks at a Yelp review for a fucking fast food place? You're gonna eat there anyway because you know what you're buying.   Bonus points to them for the cute girl always working the drive thru"}
{"text":"This Burger King has the slowest service that I have ever experienced and the most inadequate human beings that I have ever dealt with.  Perhaps, this is mean, but I am only speaking the truth.  It is probably the smokey environment that is rotting their brain cells.    I step up and give him my order, \"#4 with medium onion rings and a diet coke.\"  He slowly repeats after me while pushing some buttons on his register.  So, I move on, \"yeah, and a whopper junior, no mayo please.\"  But, he slowly repeats my first order another 2 times.  OK fine, not everyone is as quick on the ball.  So, after he gets the second part of my order, he asks me if it's eat in or take out.  I told him, \"to go please\" and he responds with, \"OK, for here.\"  I seriously thought he was kidding so we just stared at each other and I didn't say anything.    After what was nearly a 10 minute wait, our food comes out and I have fries instead of onion rings!  And the food is on a tray!  Ugh.  I did not have the patience to wait another 10 minutes to get the order right, so we just asked for a bag and bagged our order and left.  Now, I slightly feel like a jackass for writing such a mean review but I guess I need to work on my anger management issues first."}
{"text":"Drive through was nasty. Drive through window was dirty. Lady taking my order was slow, hands were ashy and belly hanging out of shirt. Looked like she was high or hasn't slept in days. I should of driven away at this point. The food was cold and iced coffee was way too sweet. Food went to the trash."}
{"text":"Extremely rude and unprofessional lady taking orders at the drive thru this morning! First she rushes you throughout your order and then she makes comments like \"uh uh we don't need all dat\" like HELLO your mic is still on lady! If you're going to talk crap about customers, then at least make sure your mic is off ? That was just one of the rude comments of the morning, she ended with \"check if your order is right on the screen, I need to know now.\" Wth? Oh HELL NO! Pat needs to go! If you don't like your job, keep it movin! We don't need that type of negativity servicing our military and their families!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a 1 star because zero isn't an option. I have received poor service here on several occasions and didn't want to visit tonight but I was out voted by the rest of the family and didn't want to make a separate stop. I ordered the Tendercrisp. It was cold and hard, the breading was tough and dry. My husband ordered the BBQ Bacon Whopper. Laughable. The meat was the same temperature as the lettuce and about as thick as a piece of paper. I now have the family's backing that we will not return. Thank God."}
{"text":"Burger King is a rare thing for me since I don't eat fast food very often, but after taking my family down to Searchlight, we were all hungry and decided to stop here. The drink machine was...weird. There's a little touch screen and you select which drink you want from the screen, which is something that I've never seen before. Service was slow -- there were only about three people working there at the time we were there, but they ended up getting all of our food orders right. Again, it's rare for me to eat at BK, so it'll be a while before I return."}
{"text":"This review relates only to Burger King's currently advertised chicken burger.   I needed a quick bite and thought of the King with its various chicken sandwiches and bevy of soft drinks. They were advertising a lovely looking chicken burger sandwich so I ordered it. Looked scrumptious. It isn't. Don't do it. Put it down and slowly step away from the sandwich.   Even with lettuce, tomato, and cheese, it is barely palatable (and I was raised by wolves and born in a barn, so my standards are not so high).  The chicken patty is difficult to describe. The texture is like a soft undercooked McDonald's sausage McMuffin patty and a little larger.  It is not breaded and was in my sandwich pretty warm.  It is a white patty with a few charbroiling marks. Because the taste is so weird, I subjected myself to a third bite only for purpose of trying to describe the flavor for you.  It took me a few minutes to look at it and marvel at its curiosity so by then it was lukewarm.   On my third bite, I nailed it!  It tastes like a McDonald's Mc rib patty without the barbecue sauce.  The fact that it is white and softish but tastes like a brown McRib patty really throws me off.  I've put a lot of weird things in my mouth in my time, but this is the strangest and worst thing yet.  (As a barometer for my fellow Yelpers, know that I enjoy raw fish, sushi, poi, spam, cold tofu, brussel sprouts, mushrooms, onions, octopus, and runny eggs, among other things. My stomach is no shrinking violet.. some would say \"expanding\" though).   I don't like harshing on places or their food. But this is a weird one. Wow.   But, to be short, the restaurant itself is quite pleasant. Well lit, clean and nice courteous people.  Long live the King.  Death to the chicken burger!"}
{"text":"This location is terrible. It is the first and only time I will come here. I decided to dine in. Mistake. The girl who took my order was CLUELESS. I wanted an original chicken sandwich and a drink. In the window is a large promo poster offering Frozen Coke or Fanta for 1.00. I get to the register and order one and she says, they are actually 2.00\". No explanation as to why. I order my sandwich and tell her I want a 16 oz drink(1.29). She rings my order in and gives me a high total. I question it. She rang in the wrong type of drink. We finally agree on the more reasonable total of 5.56. I give her 6.00 cash and she looks at me and says, \"do you want your pennies?\" WTH? I say yes and I am pondering this as she puts change in my hand. It was supposed to be .44 cents and she gives me .08. Over it.     ***Update before I leave. Another lady came in and ordered/got the 1.00 Frozen Fanta. I walked up to the counter and explained my poor customer service experience to another employee. She gave me a comp drink to make up for the hassle. They are quite yummy.*******"}
{"text":"I don't hold any fast food joint to a high standard at all but c'mon, my entire order was wrong!  I don't eat fast food often for many reasons, now I am reminded yet again, one of the reasons why.  I did a visual inspection before leaving the drive thru and it all looked correct. But, when I got home, it was a different story. Of course, it is a gamble when ordering at any drive thru and since this is a gambling town, I will probably go back. Put it all on black and let it ride!! :)"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, Been there a couple of times and nothing changes, you ask for no onions in your burger and that's what you get. Gave them a coupon today for a special and still charged me full price and even gave me an attitude for letting them know."}
{"text":"My husband & I have used the same Burger King for years, but it has gone down hill.  We don't go as frequently as we use to as they can not seem to get the order right!  Last night we came in with coupons (no problem) and ordered a total of 3 burgers (1 DBL CHS & 2 BAC CHS [1 w/no cheese] 2 SM FRYS, and 2 SM SODAS.  This order was a TO-GO order.  We got home and (as usual) cheese was in ALL 3 burgers!  I do not like cheese in my burger but I love to have the bacon!  Someone in the production area is NOT reading the order slip as everything was correct on the slip.  The rest of the order was okay but certainly nothing special or exciting enough for a quick return.  It will be another several months before I will be willing to try again.  Survey Code: 94282-27011-03902-150152."}
{"text":"Very bad experience using the drive-thru this morning!! I used the drive-thru since I was in a hurry to get home and wanted a quick breakfast. I wanted scrambled eggs and pancakes. I was confused with the menu and was not sure how they classified this combination on the menu. I asked the host that I wanted an order which includes pancakes and scrambled eggs. She could not take the order unless I used the specific name for the breakfast as it is shown on the menu. She just said that she could not understand which item I was asking for. Well, I realized that the \"Ultimate Breakfast Platter\" is the choice that includes pancakes and scrambled eggs among other things, so I said that I wanted the \"Ultimate Breakfast Platter\". And here I am, at home eating my pancakes with no biscuit and NO scrambled eggs whatsoever. What is wrong with this people?? Lesson learned! There is other places around, why did I stop here?? Not any more!!"}

{"text":"First thing we do when we get to az for the winter is go to bk we had whoppers and thought they were awfully dry hardly any mayo and the meat was dry but we will go back love bk"}
{"text":"Ripoff. I travel a lot and usually fast food prices inside airports are the same as standard. I was trying to save money, thats why I went here. They have no prices listed. When it rang up it was over 2x more than excpected. B.S."}
{"text":"I'm seeing a lot of complaints about service, but my experience with the drive-thru here has just about always been efficient and pleasant. (Of course, any task that ends in eating a hamburger probably gets graded on a curve for me.)  This is a good spot to pick up a quick lunch as you pass through the South Side...even if the dark pass-through where you grab your food kind of makes it feel like you're en route to a drug deal."}
{"text":"The food at this location is average on a good day and the service is awful. It nearly always takes forever to get your order and half the time part of it is incorrect. There is a reason it is always empty while the McDs is always busy."}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace! I understand flies are everywhere but there shouldn't be this many inside a food joint! I ordered their new lucky charms shake for my son and sent him to get our order when our number was called and they refused to give him his shake, only gave the food. I sent him back with the receipt and told him not to come back without his shake, teaching him how to handle these situations without getting out of character. He showed it to prove we paid for it but didn't get it and they made it for him. But what was terrible was when I got back in line to order myself an ice cream cone I had to wait 10 minutes, then they asked me what I was waiting for. I gave them my receipt so they made my cone, but the girl that handed me my cone had filthy hands like she was outside playing in the dirt. I told her that her hands are filthy while she touched all on my cone, she didn't care just turned around and kept handling food."}
{"text":"How a while the music wasn't working, but now they got it fixed. Not the best Burger King ever but far from the worst in town. They never have made my order wrong so extra  for that!"}
{"text":"My last purchase ever at Burger King. Is it too much to ask for them to offer aspartame sweetener for a fairly lousy $3 cup of coffee?"}
{"text":"This place sucks! The food sucks the people suck and the prices are way to high for fiod that tastes like ass"}
{"text":"I usually get breakfast from here and it's always been hot and good but this day I decided to grab lunch. BK you can have this sandwich back. The whopper is the king of bk and it looks like a peasant on my plate. Try again. If nothing else is made fresh, the whopper should be."}
{"text":"I think they clean with dirty towels, this place is filthy not a clean spot in eye sight! Looking into the kitchen where my food being made, and it's no better."}
{"text":"They always mess up my order. One time mid summer they made me pull around to wait on fried and forgot I was out there. Ten mins went by when I drove back in and she tried to lie and say the fries were still cooking. I emailed corporate and never got a response. They have horrible turnover. Every time something goes wrong they say it's because they're training people. The only reason why I continue going back is because it's near by. But if you decide to go make sure you have an extra thirty minutes to fix their mess ups."}
{"text":"The assistant manager Ralph understood our problem and replaced our missing whopper, thank you so much!!! im always looking forward to eat at this location."}
{"text":"Good food  Always fresh and spectacular customer service  Food is awesome  Order is always correct  Drive through fast service and always fresh to order  Great job"}
{"text":"Once again got the order wrong. Couldn't hear the lady through the ordering speaker and even had her repeat the order back. How hard is it to get 3 plain cheeseburgers and two small fries correct? Lady in purple hair is just awful. Need to take a lesson from Chick Fil A and the training they give staff members!"}
{"text":"For some reason I had a craving for a bk cheeseburger. Maybe it was all the Eclipse commercials. (Team Edward!/team Taylor!)   Either way I entered here on the wrong side and followed the rat maze to the counter. Whopper meals are almost $8! I ordered a cheeseburger for me and chicken tenders and fries for my son plus drinks for a total of almost $16!!!  The burger was fine but the fries were disgusting. I wish they had a USO here."}
{"text":"I don't expect much service from a fast food place but when it happens I appreciate it. The reason for this review wasn't for bad service it was ok-ish. They were busy and I did appreciate the speed they were working at in checkout. The problem is they were going so fast they got my order wrong. I ordered a number 3 and got a coffee- easy fix though! The one hung that was annoying was the place to sit was trashed! It was so dirty and mess everywhere! While I do get it is the customer that made this crazy mess it was just really gross! It made me wonder what behind the scenes looked like!"}
{"text":"Whoever owns/runs this restaurant should fire themselves. Whatever Coke Rep is over servicing this restaurant should be fired as well. Shame on both of you. Replace the old nasty machine now. Gross gross gross.  Half Star. The half is for the nice manager and clean dinner area only."}
{"text":"I hate to admit that I come here often but it's soooo close to work and I find their onion rings  irresistible despite the fact I don't care much for onions. If I'm getting fast food, chances are I'm not getting out of my car - this place is no exception, so I can't say much about the cleanliness of the restaurant or bathrooms.   There is one lady who is ALWAYS working, it never fails. She is awesome, always smiling, super friendly and never forgets to hook me up with ketchup and anything else I may require.  My order is always the way I ordered it, hot and quick."}
{"text":"Came here because I had a free meal.  It is a little out of the way for me, but I was pleased to find out that the service was super fast and the staff was very friendly!  If I am near this BK again and am feeling hungry, well I know where I'm going!"}
{"text":"This BK is right around the corner from my house and job, so I frequent it quite often.  I have never had more than a 5 minute wait from time of pulling into line, very important for when I am on lunch!  The staff has always been friendly and always responsive.  Although, evertime I go they have this generic message asking how my day is and I always respond like a tard- so to save yourself, dont worry about responding! :)"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and practically had our food thrown at us as the drive thru lady was in such a hurry to rush is off. In fact she was in such a hurry she forgot to give us our drinks, and when she realized we were still sitting there she opened the window and said \"what do you need?\"  Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"This Burger King has always done a great job when it comes to accuracy in orders. The staff is generally friendly and I haven't come across any rude staff members, yet.  I wish that Burger King (as a company) would work on reducing their prices. I just don't feel like the food is on par for the prices you pay. $7.00 for a Whopper combo? That seems high, the burgers are good but there not anything to write home about. In the meantime I continue to utilize this Burger King."}
{"text":"I'm supposed to be able to \"have it your way\" but there's no burger menu in the morning, and they can't change the menu until lunch time! And the kids are playing in the play place and the hand sanitizer is empty.  You would think with all the news stories about how filthy these play places are they would at least keep the hand sanitizer dispenser full."}
{"text":"The order taker did not look me in the eye.  She did not smile. She did not welcome me to Burger King.  She gave me a new name \"order number 121.\"  Some other girl shouts about three times \"Order no 121,\" slams my bag down on the counter.  No thank you or any thing. Calls me \"order number 121.\"  I have a name. My mother and father gave me a nice name and it is not order number 121!"}
{"text":"I really love Burger King and never had a issue til the last couple days ago. One I had ordered meal under $15 and I had got asked to see ID, seriously ID?? I would expect to see ID if I order maybe over $50 but really. When I asked why they need it all I got was because I need it.  Next I had ordered food from the place and gAve them a $10 bill and the guy literally took 5 min looking at it. I promise it was not fake. Very rude customer service."}
{"text":"poor quality food excellent friendly staff overpriced junk food dirty seating area cold fries soggy buns English and French speaking cashiers  they greet you in French first"}
{"text":"Everything on my double meat whopper for the 3rd time, sucks scraping all that stuff off. Called them but nobody picked up"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru early one morning on my way to L.A. I ordered a bacon, egg & cheese biscuit and headed out to the Freeway.  I went to eat my breakfast biscuit as I was driving and it was so gross!! The bacon was like rubber and greasy. You couldn't even chew it. The egg was all watery, nothing like I've ever had before!! Too bad I didn't check it before I headed out! I should have gone to Sonic to get a bacon, egg & cheese burrito instead as the Burger King one was very gross!!"}
{"text":"Don't really eat here but have stopped in a few times for something quick or to quench that craving for some fries. Holy heck, the saltiest fries ever. I don't mind having to shake some salt off because well, you're at Burger King. I don't expect perfection. However, it usually takes quite a while. As in 20+ minutes to get whatever I order and the fries are unbearable. I'd give the benefit of the doubt and say that I've just been that unlucky person, but oh man!"}
{"text":"This Burger King is a bit sweeter then the other burger kings in the valley. There is a specific manager that is super nice and polite, always prompt with saying hello, taking the orders, and helping you out. But without her here, the service seems slow, unfriendly, and the poor employees just seem tired and worn out.  The food though is mostly fresh. One thing you have to ask for fresh is the mac and cheetos, and anything chicken.  One complaint is that I ordered chicken rings, when they had them, and they instead gave me chicken fries. It took ten minutes to get new ones, and for anyone to even help me none the less. But this place is an overall improvement of other burger kings. If you want to take your kids somewhere to play and eat, this could be one spot to come too."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my whopper that I was craving. The food was about the only thing good here, the burger was good and the fries were actually hot.  But the service in here was really slow. Came in there was two people in front of us in line and two people behind us. The guy in the drive-through kept taking orders nobody said hello to us when we walked in and nobody told us we were going to wait. About 6 minutes went byand then all of a sudden three people walk in and start working. Finally got our order taken, but then we had to pick out a table and all the tables were dirty. Decided to come into the Playland for my kids, and the tables are still dirty. As a matter fact it was freezing in there.  When I received our food there was mayonnaise all over the chicken sandwiches that we ordered. Needed to go get napkins and there were no napkins buy the drink station, had to get them from the front counter. The drink station was dirty you husband wanted water, but it was yellow, so Jewett for the Sprite. He took a drink and it was only carbonated water. So we all had to drink Coke, but only from the second fountain, the first fountain's Coke was yellow as well, well at least it wasn't soda. If I go back to burger king it won't be to this location."}
{"text":"I once chided people on reviewing chains...though, it was at a time where there was some type of drive to review a shiz-ton of places, and everyone began banging out reviews of Subways.  I have since recinded that belief, as I think that giving props to a chain that goes a bit above and beyond can be just as valuable as turning in a 25th review of a place that everyone already goes to.  So my lovely companion and I were on the way to check out Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Musical at the new Blank Canvas Theatre. We were running kind of late, but were both starving. Right at the corner to turn toward the theater, we see the Burger King standing there. Sheepishly, I said something like \"...wanna just get Burger King...?\" She agreed, and started confessing her addiction to their chocolate shakes.  I have to say, I stopped going to the BK a while back, as I had thought they went way downhill, across the board. However, I got two cheeseburgers, she got a double, and all three were incredibly tasty. I had been a bit nervous as after-rush fast food burgs sometimes tend to sit a while, but all had clearly been made right then. The shakes were awesome, a bit thicker than McD's standard shakes.  The gal at the drive-through was remarkably pleasant. I wanted to tell her to hang in there, and in 15-20 years she'd be a district manager of BK making twice what most people with master's degrees make, but the show was starting soon and we had to demolish our food. Hopefully she already understands that.  So, a pretty solid BK. Don't be afraid to hit it up."}
{"text":"Since the whoopers are made to order, I wonder how the two served to me we're both cold, dryed out and. Just plain bad."}
{"text":"Good service,food lived up to my expectations from Burger King."}
{"text":"This used to be a good Burger King. Long lines of people at the counter returning food. Wrong food given to the wrong customers. Management needs to address the poor customer service. Several times found people practically bathing in the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Simply the Best....everyone is so nice, the food is always hot, like the gorgeous latina that works there, and its fast, polite, and always better than all the rest."}
{"text":"The food here is just as good as any other Burger King, but a warning for those looking to dine in.  The parking lot is behind the restaurant and the entrance is near the front.  Also, the drive through wraps around the building, so if you come here to dine-in at a busy time, such as lunch, then expect to have to walk and go past all the cars in the drive-through."}
{"text":"Terrible. Over priced, the foods always cold. I'm not going to ask for fresh fries ever visit. Lobby is gross. Didn't dare venture into the restrooms."}
{"text":"This BK always, and i mean ALWAYS messes up my order. Like its on purpose. I even called & got a manager to correct it, came back. Pulled off to the SAME FREAKING MESSED UP ORDER!!! Thanks to this place, i always check my food now before I pull off. The pretty much make up their own hours vs whats on the door. I showed up once and they we're closed before its time and it wasn't even an holiday! Avoid at all cost, rather drive to the BK off of Sharon Amity."}
{"text":"Our neighborhood Burger King. Food is fast food restaurant quality obviously. Service is pretty good. We've been here quite a few times mostly for a quick dinner but sometimes for a quick lunch on the go. I like using their coupons, I mostly use their app for that. My favorite sandwiches are the original chicken sandwich and the whopper."}
{"text":"Normally, I don't have much to say about fast food chains but the reason this is actually special is how fresh and delicious the food we ordered was at this particular branch!!   My husband wanted to get a quick bite while we were in the area so we passed by the drive through and he ordered the 2 for $6. He picked a whopper and the chicken sandwich. I decided to try a couple of bites each and it was just delicious!! I can't tell what the difference is. We have a Burger King branch close to our house in Mesa and it cannot compare to this one! It was hot and fresh and tasted great!  Although I am not a big fan of fast food, I think this branch just ruined me! Lol. Stay tuned for more check ins at this location!"}
{"text":"All of us know Burger King and Macdonalds  But I just love Burger King  I try not to eat it much and we all know why , but ones a month my body tell me Burger King  Not Macdonald not wendes not in and out just Burger King  I think there food is the best for this industry"}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life! I pull up to the drive thru and was told to please hold a min. Ok that's fine! 5 mins go by and i say \"hello?\" The lady inside responds back with please hold a min. What? I've been holding. They were not busy! 1 car at window,  me at speaker and then someone behind me. I pulled off because my kids are getting hungry and I'm not going to sit at a drive thru waiting like that. I'm not sure if they only had one person working but my goodness that was horrible! I will never go there again!!!"}
{"text":"Dora helped us Today, great customer service. Just fast service location looked clean."}
{"text":"The most NON-fast food, going on 11 min waiting for chicken fries & fries, and impossible traffic from all sides. Terrible, worst BK I have ever been to!"}
{"text":"I would give A 0 if I could , my kids and I walked there from our house to get out for awhile and enjoy  the evening, So of course we get in there and it's 110 in the lobby .When I told them. lol Get said yes , we have no AC like it's nothing !!! Then we get our 21$ order our shakes out melted ,they were getting ice from the sofas machine in the lobby because they had none behind counter , Bathrooms were disgusted others refused to go inside them , and when I got my food omg!!! The. Chicken sandwich was rubber and old , lettuce was hot and soggy, I had to get my money back , of course I only got back 4.86$ because she only refunded my sandwich... and the manager was yelling at her cooks in front of everyone so sad"}
{"text":"I was there last night and they were horrible I felt like a chimpanzee could have got my order with out complication 2 #1s one of them w no onions. I get to the window and they say we can't get satisfrys on one it has to be both and they wouldn't accept my cupon for 2 whopper meals because I asked for satisfrys on one. And then he said we had 4 whoppers and 2 fries wtf I asked for my card back and cancel my order. Screw this place not even recommended to my enemy's. My order shouldn't have been that complicated or taking that long. 10 minutes to figure out my order of 2 number 1s one of those w satisfrys and no onion. Smh"}
{"text":"I'm SO sad they closed it.  I used to go to this BK because it's close to my work.  The staff is pretty bored but they are cool though.  I'm usually blasting them out with music so when I don't have it on they ask where the music is at.  They have gotten all my orders correct for the most part.  They could use some help at making sure the hamburgers are hotter because I would think they let the patties sit in the trays too long sometimes.  I'd like to see BK bring the debit card pin pads back at least inside because they accepted Android/Apple Pay previously."}
{"text":"Never been a big fan of Burger King anyway but was especially soured by one of the worst tasting burgers I have ever had the displeasure of tasting in my entire life.  Pretty sure the mushrooms were stale, sadly if I were hungry enough I might go here again..."}
{"text":"This is the best Burger King I have ever been to my whole life. The staff in the drive through is so nice and pleasant, every single morning that I go here. My order is always correct and I have not had one single complaint, problem or negative experience here, with the people, the food or anything else."}
{"text":"I had been in meetings all day so having a healthy lunch went out the door due to the intense hunger pangs.  I decided I'd might as well go big or go home and just get a whopper slathered in mayo and ketchup. Figured it would be quick since there was one person in front of me and no one in the parking lot dining in....WRONG.  After 22 minutes, I finally pulled up to the window to give the person my debit card.  I waited some more and finally got my meal 10 minutes later.  Only saving grace was the whopper and fries were piping hot; however it should not have taken over half an hour.  This is not what I call \"fast\" food."}
{"text":"So far we've only eaten inside. The staff has always been friendly, sometimes super friendly and they've actually gone out of their way to make sure we're happy. (Yeah, \"Mom fail\" on ordering the cheeseburger regular instead of plain - they insisted on making a new one when it was totally my mistake.   They seem to always have clean tables too, at least on Friday nights. We also like the fact that they have condiment pumps available at the counter. Pretty nice one for a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"It's a Burger King. The building is pretty cool looking and the interior has a nice setup, but it's still Burger King. That fake grill flavor is rancid. Service isn't great, but it's Burger King."}
{"text":"My order was very fast, even though i felt a bit rushed lol I got my order quick. As for dining in it was a bit messy..tables were a bit dirty where it needed to be wiped down..but other then that I'd dine here in the future."}
{"text":"The food was ok but, would it kill the cashier to say, \"hello?\"  I guess the manager of this place doesn't care about customer service because they deal with a captive customer base.  People would probably tell me that I'm expecting too much."}
{"text":"Fast food+inside airport terminal= One OVERPRICE Meal!  Got the whopper JR meal. I ask to sub the fries for onion rings. Was told they was out of rings. Total was $8.09 + tax. Almost 9 bucks for a whopper jr meal. Shame! Atleast the fries came out piping hot. For some reason the sprite taste extra deliciousness. Maybe I was extra thirsty. Ha.  2 star for outrageous price. 3 star for food quality."}
{"text":"Embarrassing confession: I used to Love BK, and this is the worst of over 30 I have frequented in my life.  Before they infested the neighborhood with Rats, for real, this place was best known for mean service, prostitutes in the drive through, inexact change, and long waits and food in a high crime area. My food often didn't resemble what was ordered, or anything else on the menu.  Haven't been at this location since.  Time to shut it down for health reasons"}
{"text":"Ordered a Whopper in the drive thru . I asked for it to be wrapped in lettuce and to add ketchup. No ketchup, not wrapped in lettuce. They just threw some shredded lettuce on it. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Do you want a surprise bag of food full of absolutely nothing that you ordered? Would you like to be treated like $#!+ when you drive back toget what you paid for instead of a bag full of random burgers with obvious week old hard buns? My names Jimmy and id like to tell you about this Burger King! DONT! Just dont. You know its nasty to begin with. You know for an extra dollar you can get a togo burger from Red Robin across the street? You can, you should,  you are welcome!"}
{"text":"On the hunt to find the best fast-food fish sandwich and I can now eliminate Burger King from the hunt as their fish sandwich is terrible. It's over cooked, crispy on the outside. It has far too many pickles on it. It does have lettuce and some kind of tarter sauce. Overall, it smelled of old grease and tasted awful. After two bites I threw it away. The search continues. This store is always clean and the drive through is quick. I'll continue to stop by for my monthly burger fix, but won't be ordering fish again."}
{"text":"I would usually give a good review. Tonight is not the case. I went to get my family food and not only do I ask if its all there I didnt check. The girl told Me it was so I believed her. Wrong choice. I got home and I was missing not 1 but 2 of my burgers. So I tried to call and that got me no where. No one answered the 6 time I called on my way back. When I get there they are like ok gives me the 2 burgers and says there you go. I feel for them missing my burgers they could have given me a pie or a shake something for the fact I had to drive back."}
{"text":"Seems like a very well managed restaurant.  Been here many times.  Good food that always tastes fresh.  Clean dining area and the restrooms are always very clean!  Kudos to the management."}
{"text":"I use to love Burger King but these one really killed it for me order a whopper and smelled n tasted like it was burned was nasty"}
{"text":"This place is so sloppy and a waste of money.  I've always loved burger king until Sunday morning when I had to park to wait for my food and just about everything was wrong or uncooked"}
{"text":"I know this is only a Burger King but it's by far the worst one in the area. The few times I've been here I needed something quick, which this was not. They aren't very accurate either. They are batting zeros on my few orders. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have never had a complaint about this place, I always use the drive thew and it's fast, my food is always prepared right and my whopper is always stacked perfectly:) and never messy. Maybe I'm just lucky.:D"}
{"text":"They got the order wrong after making ten trips back and forth, they still managed to give me a cold egg sandwich, skip this place wait for next service stop, restrooms were nasty, tables were sticky, it was just nasty"}
{"text":"Came here for a late snack with my husband and it was somewhat satisfying. My food was hot which is good and the cashier was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed as far as napkins/ketchup etc."}
{"text":"I'd just like to know who just throws a breakfast burrito half wrapped in the bag. Ohhhh yeah that's right this Burger King. Also you may want to tell the drivethru chick to smile."}
{"text":"Super fresh and fast. Living up to the name fast food. The drive threw clerk wasn't too welcoming. Smile a little"}
{"text":"I come here every time I crave cardboard or food poisoning. It's close to Sheridan, so if I ever feel miserable in school, it's there to remind me that there are worse things out in the world. Also, they only give you one pack of sauce instead of two when you get the 10 piece nugget deal, making it hard to mask the taste of recycled newspaper. At least it's cheap though so I can clog my arteries and waste away while still having enough to pay for rent."}
{"text":"$5 for a freaking croissanwhich.   I hate airport food, and this was absurd. Some of the breakfast meals were almost $13. $13 for a freaking bacon egg and cheese biscuit!   I justified this stop by telling myself that everywhere else was going to be way more expensive, and at least I knew what to expect from BK. I knew to expect crap food but usually the prices are more palatable. If you happen to be navigating the LV airport, do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere. It might be $20 for a bagel at Einstein Bros, but at least there you can pretend it's not just the same garbage you can buy at ANY OTHER LOCATION for $2."}
{"text":"Worse. BK. Ever. Slow and filthy. Stopped in hoping to save $$ over eating in the mall. We had a FIFTEEN MINUTE WAIT after we ordered or food. Fifteen minutes for a whopper and kids meal with nuggets? Ridiculous. And it wasn't just us. About 12 people were huddled around the drink dispenser, all waiting for food.   Empty tables were dirty. No one was cleaning tables. A spilled drink was on the floor with no one making an effort to clean it up.   I asked for barbecue sauce for my daughter's kids meal and all 3 packs they gave us had been compromised. It looked like they had been cut with a knife. The cashier just shrugged at me when I questioned it. (We did not eat the sauce.)  We will NOT be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This location needs a little help. The drive through light was not on. Maybe it was broken but it appeared close at 7pm at night. There was a delay in anyone to take my order which was disappointing because when I pulled through the drive through no customers were placing orders inside or in the drive through. My food was cold including my frozen in the middle apple pie which I did have to drive back to the Resturant to have them fix it. The manager was nice and fixed my order right away."}
{"text":"1st experience was not the best but I will give them another shot another time. I went through the drive-thru only to pull up to a screen that did not have lights on. No big deal as I knew what I wanted but someone with bad eyes it would be a pain. I had one customer in front of me and they got their food right away. All I ordered was a small Icee and Apple Pie. Well I had a slight wait for some odd reason but the manager who rang me up and served my food was friendly and apologetic. However, I pulled off drove away to find that my pie was warm on the outside and frozen in the middle. Yuck! I did go back through the drive-thru and got a fresh extremely hot replacement. I believe their pies are frozen and the microwave them. Not sure if I will have that again?"}
{"text":"I am giving this location a 1 star because of the awesome nite crew they have. I am here during lunch at the moment, and as usual the staff here are incompetent and straight rude. None of them know the menu and they dropped a stack of cups on the floor ... And still served it to the customers. They rolled their eyes at me when i told them i dont want the dirty cups out loud. Hmmm... I should call the BBB and Health Inspectors on them."}
{"text":"It's burger king! If you don't know about it....try it. Their Burgers are good but their milkshakes are better! Try a milkshake! Then go play slot machines!"}
{"text":"I decided to give them a second chance. Everyone deserves it. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!  I ordered my food to come off the broiler. It was old and burnt and not edible at all. We ordered and paid for cheese on these crispy chicken. Sandwiches. Half the order had cheese. The other sandwiches had none. The first bite I took of the chicken sandwich was like biting into breaded cardboard. When I called the manager seemed not to care one bit. He seemed uninterested in the issue. I wasn't calling to return the food or get free food. But he didn't care regardless. I will never go back or even recommend that anyone go there."}
{"text":"I was surprised on how clean this place was! The bathrooms were very clean and didn't smell bad at all, though they were a little small. All the tables were set up nearly and the whole area was free of liter. Very nice!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the Drive Thru Only. All my experiences have been through the drive thru. The customer service at the driver through has always been superior. Friendly service with a smile. Orders were repeated. Cash handling has been accurate. All my orders have been correct. All my food has hot and fresh."}
{"text":"My experience was for the drive thru....  The exterior of this location was nice and neat which includes the drive thru area. Yesterday, I had to make a quick run before a meeting. I drove up and was able to place my order right away. The gentleman working the cashier area was friendly as he repeated my order back to me. When I drove up my food was hot and ready. Everything was great. Matter of fact I will return when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Long long line. Easy to get in and out due to a stop light. Today my fries were extra fresh. If you want sauce (like BBQ, ranch and etc) they will charge you $25 per sauce"}
{"text":"When you go to Burger King you have to know what to get! I come to this place for one thing & one thing alone.....the whopper with cheese. Fries and onion rings are okay. I do like their mocha frappe better than McDonald's."}
{"text":"This weeks award for the least amount of stars goes to this location. 3 whoppers w/cheese ordered - 2 no onions and the other no ketchup. Should be simple...... Pleasant girl at the drive-through window. Pulled out onto the road and when I open the bosses whopper it was all wrong. The boss is me of course. No mayonnaise, it's got ketchup and no cheese. Did a little U-turn and drove back to the location to get this catastrophe fixed. The nice guy that I am, i gave the girl at the counter my receipt and kindly explained to her I had no cheese no mayonnaise the plenty of ketchup that I didn't want. The order was initially taken correctly so cooks mistake here. Girl at the counter had to explain my order twice to the cook so I'm not sure their level of education but they didn't graduate from Burger King university yet I can guarantee that! Jumped in the van and started heading towards my job, grabbed out that fresh, hopefully made to order whopper and found myself sadly disappointed. Still missing the cheese! Grrrrr  I wish I had time to go back for a third hello but time is money so I must enjoy my cheeseless whopper. Sad is me"}
{"text":"Wow,  I'm really surprised that this location has yet to be Yelped.  This particular BK Lounge is located inside Las Vegas Premium South Outlets (better known as the Belz Outlet to those who've lived in Vegas for awhile).  There isn't much to be said about Burger King.  We are all familiar with its' offerings and prices.  I don't really venture to Burger King for killer food, its more of a convenience factor.  Anyhow. . . A- Okay on this BK.   Pros:   *  They have the Whopper on the Breakfast menu. I thought there was breakfast whopper, but no.  Just the regular whopper on the breakfast menu.  Strange, but cool!   *  open a little earlier than the mall.  If you find yourself needing to be one of the first consumers at a store in this mall, you can come here to grub prior to getting your shop on.   *  I got a 10% discount.  I've been here enough (sad but true).  Cons:   *  No Drive Thru window (obviously ... it's in the mall)   *  Super loud in the food court especially during lunch hours.  Don't expect to be able to talk to the rest of your party without having to yell across the unbalanced table.    Overall:   Again, this is Burger King.  If you don't know, now you know.  Tips:   *  You can request your favorite music video while you eat in the food court ( regular texting fees apply)   *  If you are going to eat there with someone and you want to converse while eating, avoid sitting under the flat screens that are suspended 12 ft. in the air blasting music videos.   *  Bring cash.  Yes they take plastic, but there have been numerous times that their credit card machine goes on strike.  I speak from experience."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Burger King in Las Vegas. Every time I come to this location my order is wrong. I would say over 20 times I have had to drive back to exchange my food. It's to the point where I have to open my food in my car to make sure it's correct. The only reason I return is because I love burger kings food. However the accuracy is NOT THERE."}
{"text":"Had my ups and downs with this location.  As far as getting mixed old and fresh nuggets or fries.  But today I got  really hot and fresh  on both  so I gave the 3 stars. Stinks now that I can only get 2 sauces instead of 4 for 10 nuggets and large fry just bc I don't like ketchup...don't they balance out?"}
{"text":"I end up going to this location once in a while because of where it is.  In the last week I have been here twice and I will never go back. Both times I was served by the same woman.  Each time she was polite to me.  But rude to every customer of colour. Next, the washroom is never available when I am there."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! The workers didn't know how to do anything. I never had problems before. The staff didn't even know how to place another order! Insane!"}
{"text":"Oh well. Very simple order so I thought. Two regular hot dogs to go and a medium frys. What do you think are my 2 least favorite items on a hot dog. Onions and relish. Why would they even consider putting those on. I like only ketchup and mustard but I guess they can't tell the difference between plain and... The medium frys were the smallest amount of frys I ever had. I guess I should have ordered a small because that's what I got but paid for a medium. Can you guess if I will ever go back there?? I know it's fast food and they are not very educated but how hard is it to fill an order. Can't wait until robots replace them."}
{"text":"okay I'm a fan of the BK Lounge, but wow... not at this price.  PROS- * BK in the airport... awesome! * super fast speedy service * crispy hash brown... mmm. * condiments and plastic-ware station for customers * cooler with orange juice/ milk/ chocolate milk * clean    CONS- * PRICE !! * No value items  TIPS- *  If you can avoid eating at the airport, do it because the prices are ridiculous.  I ordered a breakfast combo and an extra orange juice.  The total came up to right under $13.00! * order your fries without salt to assure you get piping hot fries (or hashbrowns) then you can add your own salt at the condiment counter. * if you are at the airport waiting... keep your cup and you can take advantage of their beverage station (free refills) *"}
{"text":"Always friendly staff from my experience at this location. Plus burgers for breakfast is the best. Supremely fresh in the early morning."}
{"text":"This location has to be one of the worst locations I have been to. The customer service was horrible. The girl in the drive thru couldn't take orders and take payments at the same time. She held up the drive thru. People were backing up and leaving. When I got my food the person that gave it to me was rude. Wish I got home the food was cold and tasted horrible. I will never comeback here again!"}
{"text":"Typical Airport location, in Terminal 3.  The food was ok, Service pretty quick, but prices were excessively high,  $22 for two breakfast combos."}
{"text":"Bought the $5 deal which included 2 Jr. Whoppers, 2 fries and 2 drinks for two of us. Asked for burgers from the grill. Fries were very fresh and delicious. Burgers did taste like they were off the grill. Woman at the counter was extremely nice.      Woman's restroom was extremely clean, toilet paper was stocked and on the rollers. Paper towels were also available in the restroom. Tables were clean.     Only complaint would be it was too cold inside. May 28, 2017."}
{"text":"Hits the spot when you need a quick snack or something quick.  Similar quality to all the other chains - nothing special but it's at a convenient location for me  Staff is friendly and professional based on my numerous visits."}
{"text":"OMG!!  I went in to this Burger King thinking I was going to enjoy a quick bite.  Instead, I was ripped off.  I had chosen my meal from the menu and ordered it.  Silly me I thought the price on the menu board was the price I would be charged.  No!  Apparently you need to specify what size meal you want or the employees of this place are instructed to automatically charge you for the biggest size they offer!! outrageous!!!!  Stay away from any and all Burger King's, especially this one!!!"}
{"text":"my husband and I don't do fast food for this reason it's a Sunday afternoon and we give burger King a try our mistake. was not greeted by either of the two employees at the counter when we did go to order one of them walked away as if it was a inconvenience. the place was dirty and the service was horrible. if there's a manager there they surely are not doing your job."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst burger king I have ever been to. Has terrible terrible service. Not only rude, but slow....soooooooooooooo slow. Any time I have gone I've had to wait drive thru a minimum of 10min. Even if its one item. Absolute minimum wait time. And then when you do get your order...chances are its wrong. Its wrong or so sloppy and such a lazy job putting together-all the guts of the burger are no longer on the bun, but loaded on the wrapper. Fast food is for...fast food. They are neither fast nor are they providing the food you request. I thought it was just a particular shift there...its not. Its any time of day. Its the only business left open in the shopping center. Employees should shape up or prepare to be shut down. I'm sure someone is just waiting to wipe out that entire center and start over."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on a snowy morning. As I have mobility issues, I pulled into reserve handicap parking as my license allows. Opening the door to egress the vehicle, I had to get support from another. Lot was covered in ice, and part of the walkway was not shoveled. I was fortunate to not fall. Counter personnel were very worried about how busy they were with 3 people waiting in line. Seemed very distracted. Food was good, but pop machine was not prepared for opening and was missing many varieties as a result."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and food was ready promptly. I can usually finish a whole mcchicken meal from mcdonald but I ordered the tendercrispy chicken meal and was only able to finish the burger itself. I LOVE FRIES but couldnt finish it.   One downside to it , is the fruitopia came out as pure syrup. The soda dispencer needs a little fixing up but overall experience isn't bad. They also need a upgrade in the washroom hand dryer."}
{"text":"I probably shouldn't have high expectations from a fast food chain, but I went to this BK at 11 pm, knowing that the drive thru is opened till midnight. When I got to there, the screen that confirms your purchase for drive thru orders was turned off, and even though I sat in my car with the windows down for a good 5 minutes, no one was taking my order. Naturally, I drove up to the pickup window, thinking maybe the speakers aren't working. When I pulled up to the window, I saw three employees inside, cleaning and turning off the lights of the main restaurant. I had made eye contact with one of the employees so I thought he was going to come take my order. Wrong. He just kept cleaning. So I knocked on the window a few times; then started banging when no one was answering. I honked my horn to no avail, and when I called them, no one picked up. (I obviously worked really hard to try to get my whopper) I know I'm writing this out of hanger, but to be closed an hour earlier than advertised and to ignore a customer who clearly made eye contact with you really blows. If I could, I wouldn't even give them a star. Bye Burger King~~"}
{"text":"Lots of attitude from the woman working at the drive through on Thursday march 23rd. Don't like your job? Get another one. The miserable attitude carries out."}
{"text":"If I absolutely MUST eat fast food, I choose BK because they carry a veggie burger (vegan if you hold the mayo). Their fries are also vegan and fried separately from the meat products :)"}
{"text":"I have had better service here, but this time is was terrible. They kept getting my order wrong. Then they gave me the wrong order, so I took it. Food is typically overcooked and missing condiments all the time."}
{"text":"I've never seen a fast food place throw a burger together like this one.  And I'm not paying a compliment.  Been through several times but this last time was the worst.  Was trying the fry burger and it looked nothing like the commercial.  In fact, the meat was tiny, they globbed some condiments and threw like 4 fries in the burger and called it a night.   I could have ordered a whopper meal and made the damn thing myself better.  Understandably, it is a fast food place but perhaps it's just me.  I expect more from these joints due to their location and I've had better service at their sister places in ghettos.    Which makes you wonder how they stay afloat at all sometimes."}
{"text":"Wow.  I was the only one in line, and there were 5 people (all co-workers) sitting there chatting.  After I was ready to go at the register, it took another 3-4 minutes of waiting for them to finish chatting before I could get service.  There are way too many people that work here for the service.   At least the food was okay, although I have to say that it's not exactly \"fast food\".  You might get better service at the Chilis Too in the same airport."}
{"text":"**Breakfast Review**  I got the Bacon, Egg & Cheese Croissan'wich® with orange juice for under 5 bucks. The egg is more like the folded scrambled eggs from McDonald's (not the McMuffin) and actually softer. It's your basic breakfast sandwich and the croissant gives it a buttery fluffy texture that was ok. The orange juice comes in a Minute Maid carton which reminded me of elementary school cafeteria days... sigh. I didn't get the hash browns this time. Those are quite commuter friendly as they are served in bit sized portions.  Still, the location is a bit sleepy, with not many employees at 7am. That's not a bad thing, it just doesn't exude the kind of energy that I'm used to with Sbucks or McD's. The cashier also had a pretty bad cough and didn't look happy. Regardless, if you like Burger King, here ya go! On the NE corner of Dobson/Ray."}
{"text":"I had no clue that they opened a Burger King downtown, but of course I'm not always looking for fast food when I'm in the downtown area.  Looking for a quick bite to eat and this being the closest thing around, we decided to give it a go.  It's a rather small area when you walk in.  You can tell this is setup to be a quick format, quick turnaround location.  Not much of a seating area, it actually looks like a quarter of what you are use to.  However they do have a high bar type table that makes it easy if you want to eat your meal quickly and be on your way.  Another thing I like about this location is that they have two self serve checkout machines.  Bypassing the counter all together making for an easy transition to your food.  The food is basic, same as you can get at any Burger King in the area.  However, you may have to repeat yourself several times over to get the right order.  And from my experience, it still doesn't come out right.  Did I miss my onion rings I specifically asked for?  Of course, but I wasn't going to wait any longer for my food."}
{"text":"For a quick meal it's alright.  Right off busy Ohio River Blvd. makes for an interesting entrance/exit from this place.  At least they have ample parking available and kind of like this section where if you are making a mad dash down the boulevard you won't hit anything when you enter.  Inside is clean and somewhat quiet.  There is a television within the dining area, but it seems to be on mute the whole time.    The need to work on better training for the staff which leads to ignoring the customers.  The gentleman behind the register took forever and struggled with the menu screen.  All his coworkers could see this and instead of helping decided to continue their personal conversations.  This included what I assume to be the manager since he was wearing a different shirt than the other employees.  Some items ended up just a bit wrong, but not wrong enough to go ask for another."}
{"text":"There's something scary about going through a drive-thru that's dark.  Come around the bend from ordering at the sign and you may think you are about to be the first victim in a new horror flick.  The bushes are overgrown, weeds popping up around them.  Then you pull around and see you have to go through a dark tunnel.  A dim light flickers overhead, you hear the hum of your car engine and smell the exhaust.  You pull up to the rickety window and as it opens you almost expect an axe wielding murderer to be on the other side.  You silently pay for your food in fear that you may say the wrong thing to bring on the wrath of the employee.  As you quietly pull away, you think you're almost free until you hear the *ding ding* of the bell that reminds you of pulling up to the gas pumps.  As you pull back into the light of daylight you think to yourself, 'I survived!'  Well almost, that is until you discover now you have to dodge pedestrians on the sidewalk and then pray to god that you can get back onto Carson St.  Good luck with that.  I wouldn't step foot in this place.  Yes, it looks all nostalgic from the outside, but once you get inside it just looks rundown.  As far as Burger King goes, take the time to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"How can you knock the BK Lounge!  I just wish I lived closer to this Burger King.  I will always pick Burger King over most fast food joints.  My first job was at a burger king.  You can't beat char broiled hamburgers that are fast.  I like to get my whopper with mustard instead of mayonnaise and ketchup.  I don't understand why this confuses the employees so much.  I will ask for a mustard Whopper and I will get bread, mustard, and meat.  What the heck is that?  So I always have to carefully explain that I wanted everything except the mayo and ketchup.  Sounds like a no brainer, right?  When I don't get the juicy Whopper I like the double cheeseburger.  There is something about these little burgers that have just the right amount of meat, cheese, pickle, and mustard/ketchup.  I don't even care that they used to be $1.  I'll pay the extra .40 cents.  So if you are in the area and craving a burger fast.  Then Burger King is your place.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"With my recent experiences with Burger Kings, I thought that the third time would have been strike three with my luck.  However, I must have been lucky this day.  I pull up to the drive thru and place my order making it my way.  I watch it all come up on the screen and it matches what I requested.  I proceed around the bend and proceed to pay.  Before leaving I make sure to stop in the parking lot, which I must say is way too big for a fast food place, and make sure my order was correct.  To my surprise it was.  For once I truly got it my way."}
{"text":"Where to start.  I swear all Burger Kings are going downhill in the customer service area.  After getting my feet back on the ground and settled at a nearby hotel I decided the next thing I needed was some quick food.  I wasn't particular as to what to have, I just needed to eat something.  I should have had a better approach to this than just that thought.  This Burger King was actually really close to where I was staying for the night so I figured I would just come here quickly and be back in my room in no time.  Instead of going through the drive thru I took my chances by going inside and placing my to go order.  When I went in there was a young kid working the register and was attentive to me.  I had ordered a Whopper meal with onion rings and a bottle of water.  I had also decided to get a cheeseburger and chicken sandwich.  I had asked that the Whopper and cheeseburger not have ketchup or tomato on them.  Service was a bit slow, but I wasn't worried.  I knew that I would have my food and I could eat and go to sleep.  The one thing that we all should learn before we order to go food, check your order prior to leaving the premise.  I knew I should have, but I did not.  When I got back to my room and decided to start digging into my food shamelessly everything seemed fine.  The cheeseburger was made the way I ordered it.  I was like, alright, we got this.  Then I bit into the chicken sandwich and thought I was biting into a dog's chew toy.  This thing was either overcooked or left in a warmer far longer than it should have been.  I had thought, well, it's nothing big, I got my Whopper still.  When I opened that up, it was a disappointment.  The Whopper was not made the way I had asked for it.  Definitely not me having it my way.  Both the ketchup and tomato were on the sandwich.  I thought maybe the kid at the register put it in wrong, checked the receipt, nope that wasn't the problem as the receipt read correctly.  So the kitchen either gave me someone else's Whopper or they had one sitting there made already and gave it to me without thinking.  So the moral of the story: check your food before you leave or pay for something you are not going to eat."}
{"text":"Why am I writing a review for a fast food joint?  Especially since I have discovered Yelp, I've been going to more and more local places.  In fact this is the first time I have sat down in a fast food place and ate.  Usually it's just when I'm running late on my way to work and I need something quick to eat.  Anyway, on with it.  I was just getting over a sickness and got my appetite back and with it, I had a craving.  A craving for onion rings.  Not just any onion rings, but ones from Burger King.  Unfortunately there aren't very many left in the city, and you have to drive to find one.  This one is one of the nicer ones.  Big and spacious on the inside complete with an indoor play area.  And amazingly this location is spotless.  Clean from top to bottom.  The staff were pleasant and helpful.  The food...average at best.  But what can you say about fast food.  I was able to satisfy my craving, that's what counts.  The most interesting thing about the place is the fancy soda machine.  All touchscreen with everything in it from sparkling water to Powerade.  With a tap of the screen you can add a flavoring.  All in all, I was happy I stopped here.  Will I come back?  Eventually, but it's not going to be a daily thing."}
{"text":"There is nothing spectacular about this place.  I think that Burger King could use one of those remodels that Wendys is going through.  I don't think I have been to a Burger King that doesn't look like the late 90s or early 2000s.  The one good thing about this location is that it is right off of Rt. 30, an easy place to pull off, pick up some food and continue on your way.  Albeit there is another one up the road about two miles, but that one is further off the road.  Food is the norm, and as they say, you can have it your way."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger. Normally at other locations I'm ok with their food. This time my bun was stale and falling apart. Wtf you go though so many buns how could my be so stale. I had to. Throw it away it was so bad. I'll never go to this location again!! I live 2 min from it too!!"}
{"text":"As a Clevelander, just the word \"Steelyard\" can leave an awful taste in your mouth. Luckily, this Burger King can ease your troubles and is one of the best around from my experienced BK tour. Surely it is royalty, perhaps not the King, but the Empress of fast food joints on this horrifying stretch of road. A true diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"This is a stand alone BK in front of the Home Depot that is part of the massive WalMart/Home Depot compound just south of the 215 and Eastern.  I find it hard to give high ratings to most fast food places, since it is just that...a fast food establishment. I don't come here too often but I've always gotten solid, friendly service here. In the over 7 months I've been coming here on and off, I can't say I've had a bad experience yet(*knocks on wood*)  Aside from that, it is your standard BK location. The building is a bit newer and a bit cleaner than some others, but nothing extraordinary to set it apart from others like it.  But still, when I get that occaisional jones for some tatsy chicken nuggets, they will see me again! lol  4 stars."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever. I went thru the drive thru at about 9pm and the woman taking my order was rude and pretty much rushing me. Drive thru wasn't even busy. Like really? If you hate your job that much then leave, otherwise do your job. The lady pissed me off so much that I backed out and left. Mcd's across the street......way better. My review on social media is next."}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would this place is clean but they no nothing of my favorite fast food burger king corporate needs to send some down and train these people on how to make the sandwiches they messed my order up once I took it back then they messed it up again who knows they probably blamed me for they're mistake that's why they put halpanos on my sandwich good thing I'm not allergic or burger King would have been sued"}
{"text":"I have had a problem with my order many times. I talked to the manager last time our order was wrong. Then was told how I felt did not matter. I asked for his regional manager and was hung up on. Our food was cold and order was wrong. We did not return for a while. I called BK customer service to no avail. So we saw the 2 for Special and the nugget special and went back hoping for a better experience. When we go to the window we were asked \"what did you order again?\"OMG! Really? Then got home and our order was wrong! We ordered 2 meals for 10 and 2 10pc nuggets. Asked for nuggets fresh and yes they were cold!!!! I did not order a double wopper with cheese and thats what I got. The nuggets were cold. Again at the BK near my work the food is always hot and when I ask for fresh its made fresh! I think this stems from the manager thinking his customers are crazy. I will never ever go to this location ever again!"}
{"text":"I guess a plain Cheeseburger means absolutely nothing since we are only customers in an airport. We have to get our flight and can't return the wrong order....sigh.....  That's ALL I ordered too so....must've been too difficult for them to figure out unless they just don't give a damn.  Couldnt give them ZERO stars."}
{"text":"Usually when there's some minor problem at a restaurant,  I think \"eh, maybe the employee is having a bad day or something\" and don't take the time to write a bad review.    Especially when it's a restaurant in the quick-serve market.    Well,  this BK location could probably use some shaping up at a holistic level."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed in BK today. The manager on was very unprofessional yelling at her staff, it took a long time before anyone came out of the kitchen to help us, and my husband actually saw the manager rush into the bathroom and start dropping her drawers before the br door was even shut. It will be a long time before I go back."}
{"text":"After servicing my car and waited 2 hours. I stopped by Burger King drive thru to grab a bite to eat before work. To my luck they had 2 open drive thru lanes. Yes!! Then wth....another car pulled up on the other lane and here I am waiting for someone to take my order but they got their orders first and then the car in back of me decided to switch lane thinking maybe the first lane speaker was not working. Well, this was a one time deal so I know I won't be back here for sure. Happy eats!!"}
{"text":"It's BK. Fairly cheap and tasty. This location annoys me for a couple reasons, though. The last three times I've gone in and the coffee hasn't been ready at breakfast time. They pour people the first few drops that brew which generally ends up tasting vile. I don't know why they can't brew a pot of coffee on time. Additionally, at lunch I'll be standing and waiting for five minutes after placing my order and I'll see it get flung down the heater tray and I'll think \"Hey, at least it's fresh\". Then I'll bite into it and it's room temperature. What exactly are they doing back there to take five minutes if everything is already cooked?"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast one Sunday morning. I walked to the counter and waited five minutes. Nobody was around. I heard voices in the back so I peaked around the corner and the employees were all sat down having a kiki. I said hello and someone finally came out. I ordered the angry breakfast sandwich. The employee rang it in two dollars over the price on the menu. I told her it was too much and she told me she didn't know how to ring it in. Mmm hmm... Three or four minutes later she rang in something different than happened to be the right price and just told the kitchen to make the right sandwich. When I got the sandwich it was gross. Stale, untoasted english muffin. The cheese wasn't on the sandwich. The sauce they put on it was nasty super sweet. I would have taken it back to have it remade but I had to be somewhere in ten minutes. On the upside the coffee was pretty darn good for BK."}
{"text":"this location of burger king got me disappointed & angry today, i ordered the crispy chicken meal for $5.00 because they are sending these several coupons in the mail so i thought i enjoy a meal on my way to work, my sandwich was not eatable ! the chicken was hard like rubber, 1st bite in my mouth & i spitted out ! i think they microwaved it for too long !  because i was hungry i went for the fries, they were extra salty which i never asked for extra salt on my food, less salt is always better, so really my meal was just the drink :( burger king lost my trust as a customer, i rather stay hungry than buying from them !  i took pictures of my sandwich & my receipt , too bad yelp has no option to post pix in here !"}
{"text":"Nothing but positive for this bk. It is fast food so I can't give it a 5, but I usually typically come late at night. They haven't messed my order up once surprisingly in 5+years.   Sometimes the order might take awhile but it's to make it fresh. I love the new big Mac knock off, but my favorite is the crispy chicken salad with Ranch then asking for Buffalo sauce"}
{"text":"Before it is good but now looks and test old chicken and fries if you told them make fresh steel there are give you old"}
{"text":"Well I should've gone with their strength and had a burger but I chose an Italian chicken sandwich,  onion rings & some french fries. The fries were the best part of the meal. Everything else was so soft it could be served by a nursing home. I hope my next post has restaurants that have real food. (March 1st, 2013)"}
{"text":"Never have I had such a rude and unprofessional person at the drive thru window.  This was the most obnoxious man that should in no way be dealing with people.  He literally kept yelling at other people in the middle of taking our order with his mic open and then would come back and say \"Yo dude, is that all you need\". Then go back and scream at other employees again. Then came back again... \"dude, is that all you want\".  After ordering a burger with no tomatoes that obviously annoyed he began to ask with every item \"do you need anything special on that item\".  No ass hole my fries can be just regular as well as every other item.  Guess what, yep.  Went to complain and this jack A is the manager.  Yep, fries were cold and he put tomato on the burger"}
{"text":"Totally f'd up my order.  Drive thru is a cluster!  I couldn't figure out what language she spoke.  Food was stale and cold.  Milk shake was horrible and thin like milk.   There was so much chocolate syrup I just threw it away with the rest of the order."}
{"text":"They always want you to pull around to the front so they can bring the order out. Takes forever and it's supposed to be drive thru which means quick. This place sucks."}
{"text":"Never too long of a wait. Staff is always talk-a-tive & smiling!  Not much to say. It's a typical fast food joint."}
{"text":"It may have been the time that I visited that caused my distaste for this location but the behavior of an employee in particular left a bad taste in my mouth. I had to kill time and came to Burger King for a soda and a snack. I don't expect much when coming to a fast food joint, near a high school and on a busy street. I forgave the messy floor because there were many high schoolers there and it may have been the timing issue. Before I continue my review, I'd like to comment on the cashier who was phenomenal. She was patient, happy and attentive. I wish i caught her name, my apologies. The gentleman who was mopping the floors literally boxed us in while mopping and asked us to lift our feet while we were sitting there. While he was mopping under our feet a man walked in and asked us for money for the bus. The bk employee mopping under our feet(with headphones on) didn't even notice. We notified the employee that someone came in asking for money and the employee gestured as if he didn't care. We asked him if there was something he could do to stop the man from interrupting customers, he said no without a care. We asked the cashier who was more than happy to help and let her know of the employee who was no help. Unfortunately I don't have a name for the gentlemen mopping. I don't expect much but in one fail swoop it turned unpleasant. I greatly appreciate the young lady who helped though."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I waited at the drive thu box for around 10 minutes with no answer to me asking \"is anyone there?\" until my boyfriend had to get out of the car, go inside, and tell the worker (who was just standing around bull shitting with another worker) that there were people sitting in line waiting."}
{"text":"I'm 1000% contradicting myself reviewing a fast food restaurant but this Burger King being new looks fancy and according to recent new articles may start selling beer which I approve of.  Also honestly a whopper Jr is amazing for $1.00 + w/o cheese and mayo (I use w/o which my mom taught me from secretary school in like 68' that's shorthand also to clarify she didn't teach me in 68 she probably learned it then because I did not exist) is only like 260 calories so it's a quick, delicious, drive through option that saves me from hunger in transit, thank you Burger King. Go the hell Culvers oh yeah i said it!"}
{"text":"This location is generally not the cleanest--tables and floors are always dirty, napkins and pop lids all over the place, etc.  Veggie burger is decent, not the worst I've had but definitely not the best. Fries were stale and dry as ever! Haven't had BK in years so while it was a nice treat, I probably won't be back for another ten years.   I would've given this location 2 stars but the cashier was nice so 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"all I wanted was a hot dog. watched the young lady make it, make a mistake and drop it on the counter as she was putting it in the little box.  her co-worker laughed and they scooped up the chili and dog and put it back in the bun and tried to sell it to me. wow really. nope. staff don't care :("}
{"text":"The worst burger king ive ever seen. Service and quality are terrible. The only reason its in business is because people have few options in the airport."}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you wanna pay 3.69 for a simple double cheeseburger.  Crazy prices."}
{"text":"Fountain drink machine is down, no big deal. The problem with that is nobody in the back can make a drink order. They give us the wrong drinks then never put ice in them. Who serves soda with no ice??? We tell them the correct drinks and ask them for ice in each. Lady returns with one with ice and one with no ice. So basically she poored one out and refilled it for no reason since she put the same soda right back in it without ice. How hard is it???!!!"}
{"text":"This Burger King will serve you a whopper jr at 7am and they will not complain about it! This is a night shift workers dream!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's going on lately but for most of the fast food places near me they've all been hiring exceptionally happy people for their drive thrus. My receipt says my cashier's name was Dolores so I hope that's the right person ( I stopped by today at around 11:00 am). Bright, cheery, and all smiles; it really says a lot about a person who tries so hard to be happy when dealing with customers, especially in a drive thru. It's probably one of the hardest jobs you can have in the fast food industry, so when I come across someone who is obviously trying then I can't help but want to say thank you. I hope the lady (Dolores hopefully) who served me this morning sees this and knows that her smile makes all the difference in the world!  P.S.: food was good too, thank you, no complaints at all!"}
{"text":"I came through the drive through thinking it was past time for them to be serving breakfast, but the menu still showed only breakfast. Thinking I was still a little ahead I just decided to order breakfast and ordered a number seven. Got home and found a whopper jr. in the bag. Guess they were done serving breakfast even though the drive thru menu begged to differ. Fries were lukewarm at best. I don't know why they offer the Whopper Jr. on something other than the kid's menu; it's so tiny, but that's not this location's fault."}
{"text":"Awful awful customer service. Aside from not being able to hear your order they constantly repeat back the wrong order. When asked a simple question they pause as if your speaking a foreign language then ask you to repeat it. This situation happen to me twice in one day and 1x today."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it zero stars! Ordered food and my husband gave them a debit card to pay. They asked for ID. My husband stated that his picture was on the card and the guy still said he needed to see ID before he would sell us food. When has anyone carded for a whopper? And even though the picture was clearly on the card? The person in the drivethru was rude and looked dirty anyway. So we declined and drove off. This is why I hate Burger King. Go above and beyond for the unnecessary but can never get your order correct..."}
{"text":"I came through the drive through quickly on my way home. I ordered two sandwiches and a small fry. I live two blocks away. When I got home my mother opened her fish sandwich (cold) and it had grey flakes in it. The fries were cold and the other sandwich was not included. I went back to the store and relayed my problem to \"Brandon\" and asked him for a refund for the missing sandwich only. He asked where the rest of the food was. I reiterated that he didn't give me the sandwich to return. He refused to refund my money or replace the missing sandwich. I called corporate with no response. This is the first and last time I will be visiting this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat ashamed to have duchess status here, but sometimes, clean eating goes out the window and I just want onion rings with zesty sauce.  Clean. Friendly staff. Not always quick service."}
{"text":"Living literally next door to this place I tend to frequent it. It's about as good as you'd expect a major fast food chain to be. I've never had a problem with the food I order, it's always great. The people who take my order are just fine and the dining room itself seems clean. Depending on the time of day they do get weirdos in there but you can't blame them for that. They don't bother you. But they do a good job and I have no problem coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"I guess they don't make very many veggie burgers here. The lady looked at me crazy when I asked for one. I should have taken that as a hint. Worst burger ever. It tasted like dry hard cardboard. It tasted like they got a freezer burned patty and over microwaved it.  Don't do it guys go to the cpk next door. On the upside the French fries were pretty good but the burgers will make u sick."}
{"text":"I've been to this Burger King several times for lunch and dinner, mostly because it's the closest one to my house. Today I went for lunch, and the food was better than normal for this location.   Many times I've gone in the past I've gotten food that seems to have been sitting out for most of the day. The workers today we're also friendly. Wait time in the drive thru was also quicker than normal. If my experience every time was like my experience today, this would probably have been a 4-star rating. Whoever was on staff today, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Good service and amazing workers but they definitely need more then two workers. The girl taking the orders is also making a lot of the food which is making a three people line feel like a 15 people line up.   On a side note when you ask for something fresh don't accept it.   But they were definitely friendly which was nice."}
{"text":"I had an awful experience at this location last year and haven't been back. It's been about a year so I thought I would give them another chance. I went last Sunday for breakfast because I like the lunch for breakfast promotion that BK has. I walked in at 9:30 and visited the bathroom first thing. When I got to the sink to wash my hands, there was no soap in the dispenser. Really? I just used the bathroom and have no soap to wash up with?        I got to the front counter and ordered A chicken sandwich and onion rings. The register lady informed me that their fryer is broken and they can't make any fries or onion rings. Great! When did it stop working? Yesterday she explained. I told her just to bring out the sandwich. She took off to go do something and I was standing there, I realized that if the fryer is down, there was zero chance that they can make a fried chicken sandwich either. When she reappeared I asked her about that and she had a deer in the headlights look. That was enough to tell me I wouldn't be getting a chicken sandwich today either. I got my money back and got out of there.       When a patron can't get soap in the bathroom just minutes after the place has opened, that tells me that the manager is not completing their opening check list correctly. Any manager worth their own salt would at least stick their head in the bathrooms to see if it is stocked before they open the restaurant.      The other major issue is that the fryer at this location was broke down on Saturday and Sunday. The weekends are the biggest sales days for restaurants. Management cannot allow the fryer to be down all weekend. You have to get someone in there to get it fixed.       There are serious management issue at this location. I've been burned twice at this location and won't be back anymore, which is a shame; because I live just two blocks away."}
{"text":"Lack luster staff serving franchised food, incorrect more often then not.   Mistakes happen, but when you have staff that cares less it's a joke.   Have to check my order when I do sacrifice a good customer service experience to satisfy the craving for some BK.   Would give zero stars if possible, in my experiences you can find better food and service anywhere else."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through, with about 4 cars ahead of me. After placing my order, it took about 15 minutes just to get to the window, where I then waited 28 minutes being ignored! I know the exact time because I looked at the time stamp on my receipt! There were at least three cars waiting behind me too! I finally got the attention of the lady inside to see what the problem was, and I was just told that they are \"short staffed\" and they make the food fresh to order, Which I guess means they go out back and wait for the chickens to mature, slaughter them, and THEN make the nuggets! I asked for a manager, when she finally showed up, I was not given an apology, just the same story of being short staffed. At this point I had asked to just have my money back so that I could go elsewhere (still no food) and I was told by said manager that she doesn't know how to do that....so I waited....and finally (28 minutes later) got my food, which was cold, and my milkshake had long since melted. Waste of my time and money!  I did get a phone number also for what I was told the general manager, called, it was a cell phone with no name on the voicemail, left a message anyway, no return call.  I won't ever be back, and I don't think they even care!"}
{"text":"Apparently las Vegas does not have tacos at there burger king. I stood in line and when it was my turned I ordered 4 tacos and the girl looked at me as though I was crazy. She did not know what I was talking about, I told her tacos, you know like in jack in the box and she responded \" we don't have tacos, try a Mexican restaurant\". I couldn't believe she was so rude. However, I notice that las Vegas restaurants don't carry alto of the stuff restaurants in California do."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I get the urge for a Whopper.  I went to the counter and the manager was on the phone.  Nobody else tried to take my order.  The manager gets off the phone, walks right by me and starts yelling in Spanish to somebody or somebodies in the back.  This goes on for two or three minutes.  She then takes my order.  I ordered a Whopper with no tomato.  While she was getting my change she started yelling again.  When I got my order I got a Whopper with only two tomato's.  She is still yelling at someone.  I ate it and now am leaving.  One star is too many."}
{"text":"Best Whopper I've had in awhile. Great quality for a fast food place. .it seem to be going down hill everywhere else ..but not here everything was hot and fresh and the cashier was very welcoming she greeted us with a nice smile and a hello. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Wow this girl in the drive thru was so rude !! I don't know what her problem was  .. And to top it off the food didn't taste fresh at all..rrrrrr  I'll never come back to this location"}
{"text":"Should be less then 1 star the place is horrible  and the staff are assholes just rude and  sloppy avoid at all costs !!!!!"}
{"text":"Been a while since we had Burger King, now if it was my daughters choice. This place would have a five star rating! Burger king is her favorite place to eat. But she has no choice on this! You get exactly what you expect. Fast food chain, with medicore food! Service was actually five stars, kind of hard to believe huh! But I have never been impressed with their food. Since we have moved to Arizona, wife and I have made it a point of not eating at fast food chains. And after eating here, that just reassures us of why!"}
{"text":"WARNING!!!! DO NOT GO THROUGH THE DRIVE THROUGH.  Went there last Saturday and waited 20 minutes in line at the drive through.  Thought it was an isolated incident so went back Sunday afternoon, waited 15 minutes.  When I finally got to the window I saw a manager wearing a white button down shirt and black jeans wearing glasses, I told him my complaint and he mumbled something and turned away.  Never any apologies and what's worst no one seemed to care.  I will never go there!"}
{"text":"Not super fast wait but nothing to complain about food was fresh tasting and service was friendly"}
{"text":"I literally waited 20 minutes at the drive thru for my order. Gosh I finished my tea 5 minutes in waiting and at least offer to refill it lol. I'm not sure if the long wait was because it was short staff. I only saw two humans in there. Besides the ridiculous wait, I'm giving it a three stars because I LOVE their veggie burgers:). If I was in a rush I wouldn't even bother with this location."}
{"text":"All 5 starts for 'Angel'. Excellent customer service. We didn't have to try and guess what he was saying on the speaker. Which most humans sound like they spitting a rap lyrics on the microphone."}
{"text":"On our way to an early foster care training. Since it would be an few hours until we get out. I wanted to throw something down my throat!  We stopped off at this location since it wasn't that far from our designation. We decided to use the drive through since our time was short. Everything was very fast. Ordered, drove up, paid, got our food and gone. There is a nice section of parking spots under the trees if you decide to eat in your vehicle. Everything else is nothing different from any other franchise. Try not to eat fast food, but when you are on the go, and what to just hold you over for a later meal. It works."}
{"text":"On my way home, getting late, girls are hungry again, already in trouble since it's past their bed time! So what the hell!  The six year old, had a six piece chicken nugget meal, and ice cream. The seven year old had the spicy chicken sandwich meal and ice cream. Now I had the Angry Whopper! Time to start sounding like a commercial! The Angry Whopper has: Sandwich is 1?4 lb of savory fire-grilled beef, topped with thick-cut smoked bacon, melted Pepper Jack Cheese, freshly cut iceberg lettuce, spicy onion petals, ripe tomatoes, spicy jalapenos, and smothered with a spicy angry sauce, all on a warm, toasted, sesame seed bun. Pretty Crazy! And you know what? It was good, liked it very much. Would I have it again? Probably not, only because I am afraid to look up the calories and fat on this beast!  But seriously, I try to stay away from fast food. But they are always there when you need them.   Note# Since the seven year old did not order on the kids menu, the manager was still nice enough to give her a toy with the meal. Very nice of him."}
{"text":"Mercedes and Felicia have THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICS SKILLS. That is all I'm gonna say, avoid them at all cost. Jeanie however is ABSOLUTELY amazing one of the friendliest workers there."}
{"text":"When I went to school back in the 80's. This was my source of meals! Had a very tight budget, hardly had any money. But on my way home I would stop off here and buy two whoppers for 99 cents! That's right only 99 cents. I probably ate there 5 days a week. So I'm just rating this place for keeping me full!"}
{"text":"Who reviews fast food restaurants? And who cares? You got ketchup on your hamburger and didn't want that? Boo hoo!! I stop by here once a week for my treat of a double whopper (without ketchup) because no self respecting human being would ever put ketchup on anything.  If they fail, and screw that one task up? I should probably call the manager, leave them a crappy review, sulk and lose some sleep about it, tell my friends what a horrible experience I had and swear off whoppers for a whole month!   If I was really perturbed (and I thought it was really worth the time and extra effort to complain) I could probably get some free stuff in exchange for my phone number, address, and email?  But I eat it anyway, grin and bear it and tell myself maybe ketchup isn't so bad after all...  (For the record, they get it right 9/10 here in my experience.)"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but both times I've been served by the Manager.  I've never seen someone so nice to literally everyone who comes in the doors.  Saw an elderly couple come in and he took everything to them and got them condiments and everything!  The way he speaks to everyone is ridiculously polite.  Establishments need more Managers like this gentleman!  Great job on getting him on board Burger King!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible customer service, the fries tasted horrible like if they were just preheated in the microwave and they had black spots like from old oil. This is the last time I will ever go there."}
{"text":"Really fast service. Ordered two batches of nuggets for a $1.49 each. Came out within 30 seconds--now that's cool."}
{"text":"I went to the drive through and had the most wonderful encounter w a young man named James . He is so sweet and funny and he had really great customer service . Will be coming here again just to talk to him again ."}
{"text":"The managers are toxic children. Been here a half dozen times, have always been asked to park and wait. Oftentimes without anyone even behind me in the drive thru. A move typically reserved for heavy traffic situations at other locations are their standard operating procedure. I've written this review as I wait alongside 5 other customers.  The drive thru is currently empty and shockingly the order they delivered is incorrect. The worker has to go back to give the customer next to me sauces and drinks. BK, reassess your management team at this location. It's FUBAR."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! After repeating our order three times because she just couldn't seem to get anything past \"large water\", we pulled up only to have something missing from our order and told to pull up so they can bring it out to us. As we were waiting apparently for them to make the chicken sandwich from scratch (including butchering the chicken from how long it took), we noticed other cars were also pulling ahead to wait for food. Definitely not anything fast about this fast food joint."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! this the first time in my life that I would say I had a decent meal at a fast food restaurant. We're traveling across America and  on our stop in Boulder City Nevada we grabbed a Burger King breakfast. When asked what I wanted  I said  \" any poison it's all the same\" but I was wrong. I got the breakfast burrito and it had  sausage bacon rice and eggs .....oh my goodness hit the spot and it came with fried potatoes I think they call them hash browns. Not too appealing the dogWouldn't even eat them. Lol"}
{"text":"The grossest grilled chicken salad EVER! Slimy chicken that is NOT hot and yellow lettuce!!! At least I have the croutons to eat.  I should have known better :("}
{"text":"Food was cold! Waited in drive-thru 15 min you think they would be making your food fresh instead it tasted old. Ordered no pickles and got pickles! Chicken fries tasted old as well. Looks like they were all too lazy to make a fresh batch of fries and a fresh warm burger. Never again BK. Very disappointed. Hopefully I dont get food poisoning."}
{"text":"i was at Phoenix airport and hungry for quick bites while on transit to Newark. I decided to try the Fish burger and fries. I prefer Mac donald fish fillet over BK and these are over price fish sandwich. Expect long line and slow service during lunch hours but the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Poor Poor Poor Service, ran out to this place for a quick bit its super close to my office, went through the drive thru for an icee and chicken nuggets, I am denied my order saying it's their policy to only service icee as a fine in item..... your a fast food joint?! are you kidding me?? more over then why is it on the drive thru menu?? waste of time on my lunch break, thanks"}
{"text":"Had I read the yelp reviews before I would not have chose this place to spend my money, paid for cheese to be on my whopper and didn't receive any cheese, now I bought a few to bring home and only half had cheese, and I paid for all four... will never come back to this place, terrible food as it was dry and didn't taste like other burger kings.  My guess is it's fanchised and owner is not aware of the service.  May be they could check yelp reviews and see it has the worst ratings compared to other surrounding burger kings"}
{"text":"This BK is quite possibly staffed by the most incompetent and lazy halfwits in the world.  Yes, this place is that bad.  All the reviews written prior to mine are all true.  Saying the staff is lazy and rude is a understatement, in fact, I don't think there are words that can accurately describe the utter laziness and rudeness displayed by these employees.  I've had the drive-thru cashier drop money on the ground instead of in my hand on several occasions without even a small apology.  Orders are ALWAYS wrong.  How incompetent can someone be?  If the manager hired a group of monkeys the place would run better."}
{"text":"The food is always luke warm at this location.  If you bring it to management's attention they act as if they could care less. This location is definitely not held to the same standards as other BKs.  If you're looking for hot fresh food and staff that take pride in what they serve you,  don't go to this place!"}
{"text":"Worst fast food place I have ever visited. The onion rings were cold and tasted like burnt, rancid grease. The fish sandwich was dried out around the edges but cold and almost inedible. All four of the beef patties came from a plastic container with grease floating in it, not off the grill (this was almost 7 pm and I was the only customer, so I can't believe that they were being held for some kind of a customer rush hour). This is not food \"my way.\""}
{"text":"Beware! I ate lunch here today and have been sick all day! It tasted fine, but it's killing me now. Should have known better."}
{"text":"Enjoying a delicious chicken salad! The flamed broiled chicken is amazing! The service was prompt and very courteous!"}
{"text":"Went to buy 16 oz fountain drink from their dollar menu and was given a small cup less than 16 oz, I asked if I could get a 16oz cup instead, they refused. Told her it was false advertising, nothing happened. Apparently everyone there can't count oz's. Workers there could care less. Taking my business somewhere else. Poor management."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow slow. I hope your not in a hurry when you stop. Today I was third in line. Meal took 14 minutes to get. Unacceptable. This is a chronic problem at this particular location."}
{"text":"I'm a McDonalds person usually so I know how high standards in service go, but my co workers and I refuse to keep coming here because the drive thru service is super rude. One of the first times I came here, I tried and ordered off the value menu for lunch but I ended up making my meal a combo suggested by the drive thru operator, and it actually made my meal more expensive, it wasn't helpful at all. Will not visit again unless I'm super desperately hungry."}
{"text":"I have found the worst Burger place.When you drive up the outside is dirty and smelly ,service is sad  you get wrong order and have to wait for one simple thing.If your that hungry go to Walgreens and get a frozen microwave meal or fixing for peanut butter and jelly sandwich.A better choice and quicker.I have never gotten a hot Burger and I only live a half block from the place."}
{"text":"Why is it that I can never get a burger that even remotely resembles the item on the menu.  I decided to order something different. They had a burger called the \"A1 Ultimate bacon Cheese burger\". So I ordered it. The girl read back my order and said \"Bacon double cheese burger?\" No, \"A1 Ultimate bacon Cheese burger\". \"Do you want that as a meal\", no. \"anything else\" no. \"that will be $1.60\"..... You got my order wrong. \"you ordered a cheese burger?\", no. I ordered an \"A1 Ultimate bacon Cheese burger\", \"oh ok\".......... I guess I will get the total at the window.  Now I did get the correct \"burger\", but mine did not look like the one on the menu. In fact it was about half the height, there were 3 partial strips of bacon on it 3 pieces of onion, and it looked like a bookcase fell on it.  People wonder why I hate eating at fast food joints."}
{"text":"Look, I get that it's Burger King. I know I'm not getting a 5 Star Burger but can you at least get my order correct? That's all I ask for. I pay for cheese, I expect cheese. I ask for no mayo, don't put it all over the bun.   Incompetence at its finest."}
{"text":"on Thursday the 15th of August at approximately 8:30 pm I placed an order of about a dozen burgers for my pee wee football team and I was short on my order, ..I guess counting burgers isn't a part of customer service now at days, maybe a little basic math course should be included in the hiring process?"}
{"text":"Absolutely unacceptable. I am currently sitting out front waiting for my food, it's been 15 minutes. I went through the drive thru and was advised to pull up to wait. There are 6 yes SIX other cars that were behind my now waiting as well."}
{"text":"Just an update. Driving past, I saw the ad for the chicken nugget deal. It's $1.79 for 10."}
{"text":"We usually get pretty decent service and they have a playground. Most of the time the food is as expected.  Restaurant is usually pretty clean. Overall it's a typical fast food place."}
{"text":"Ghetto. But they do have wifi although it sucks, it's extremely slow. And lots of homeless looking for money."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning  here. Am I the only one? Fairly  gutter as I  watched a worker come out to tell his kid to sit down and be quiet. Onions on my burger were thin and slimy. Never ever again! Fuck this place with a space dick!"}
{"text":"I just started a yelp just for the poor attitude that the hoodrat with the glasses working the drive thru at 5:30 pm on saturday 3/21/15 had the whole time while taking my order and while giving my food. Did not welcome or greet me, did not give me a total or look at me while talking to me and then did not thank me. Don't be mad at the world because your hoodrat self is stucc working at Burger King. I don't know If any of you have seen those videos of people throwing their drinks at cashiers at drive thrus but if she has the same piss poor attitude, you soon will see her on youtube or wshh soon. I am only giving them a star because my food was basically ready by the time I paid."}
{"text":"Today I got my egg and cheese burritos and they sucked. I opened one of them and it spilled right out of the  wrapper and on to my clothes."}
{"text":"The young boy over the drive through intercom got extremely rude with me extremely fast. I won't be coming to this location anymore. Manager obviously needs to provide a course on customer service."}
{"text":"Unless you like being ignored, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid! Stopped in for lunch today and the place was pretty much empty. There was a lady waiting at the counter for her order, two gentlemen who already had their order and were seated and eating. There was one worker for the front counter and the drive thru and 2 or 3 workers in the back. Waited over 10 minutes for someone to take my order and wasn't even acknowledged in that time. One of the guys came up front to bag drive thru orders, wiped the sweat off his face with a napkin, crumpled it up, tossed it in the trash and then scooped up fries without washing his hands. At that point I walked out and went to Culvers where I ordered and got my food in less time than I spent waiting to order here.  Not even worth one star!"}
{"text":"It seems fast foods places get my order wrong more than they get it right. After being told they were out of onion rings and tarter sauce, they offered to substitute of mayo for tarter; I said no thank you. The receipt stated that request correctly. But the manager filled the order incorrectly not once but twice. First time I received a chicken sandwich instead of the fish I ordered. Second time I got the fish, which was good so I'll bump from 1 to 2 stars for that, but it had mayo on it. I choose BK for their onion rings which they failed to provide. Heads up Airport BK, failure to provide all menu items regularly is a violation of your franchise agreement so don't be surprised when you lose it."}
{"text":"Horrible! I ordered 2 flaming chicken burgers through drive through, got home and had a sad looking ground chicken patty between buns with no mayo, no lettuce NOTHING. I live too far to drive back so tried to call to complain, called 3x and nobody ever answered."}
{"text":"Burger King in the C-Concourse food court of McCarran Airport in Vegas.  Straight away I'd suggest you avoid this place.  There are other options in the area, including a Wendy's back towards security a bit.  The service was rude and thoughtless.  The food took 5 full minutes to come out and was COLD.  You'd think that a wait like that means they are making hot, fresh food.  The area around BK was not kept clean and the condiments were low.  The soda machine was out of a couple flavors.  Overall, this place is a disaster and if you're fortunate enough to check Yelp before eating here, I have one piece of advice:  RUN AWAY!"}
{"text":"Okay, the whole reason you ask me what my order is because you do not know what it is! Seriously!? You cannot just make up what you want and put it in a bag and hand it to me! WTH?"}
{"text":"This Burger King is in McCarran, after you pass through security. It's my default meal choice when I'm stranded here.  It's tradition for me to have a light lunch or dinner here before flying out (I even impulsively got onion rings here once after arriving in Vegas). Yes, this Burger King is reliable, but the sad truth is that airline food sucks a big fat one. Anyone else notice that this Burger King always seems to be expensive, and it's not just the sales tax talking? (It's not quite price gouging, but it comes close for fast food.) Thank goodness they take credit cards.  For many, it's easy to succumb to Burger King's greasy goodness - the other businesses in this terminal don't offer much, anyway - TCBY's, I'm looking at you!"}
{"text":"I would have given only 1 star, but gave 2 stars because of the new remodel.   It doesn't matter how nice you make it look, if the employees aren't to par.  Employees - SLOW and didn't see friendliness. Just 'I'm here because I                                 have to work'                       Loud talking to each other                       Too busy talking to each other (non English) Music         -  TOO LOUD, especially for breakfast time  Even tho' the food was as expected (although we removed the Chicken Fries from our order, not wanting to wait the 12 minutes preparation time stated by the employee) we did not enjoy the breakfast and left"}
{"text":"Burger King.. While I love Yelp, there are just some places that you go that really need no reviews. Or if they do, a small one.  Now if I were going to a 5 star resort, sure I am going to take note of everything from driving up to driving away.  But I digress..   Fast drive thru service. Food was hot, drink was cold. The soda to ice ratio was spot on... Come on, really.. Are you going to decide to not eat here based on a Yelp review?! Nope! Its fast food. Unless there is a bug crawling out of my fries, I ain't going to bitch! Put on your Kings crown and dive in the ball pit!"}
{"text":"I placed an order through the drive thru and it got totally screwed up, so i called reported it to a manager who claims he was going to write my name in book. So i return for my meal and manager David very rude decides not to honor their word so i left. Why would anybody expect me to pay twice for a meal, that manager needs to be fired. End up calling the managing company who made it better, but to have a manager as rude no company should allow this behavior."}
{"text":"There was no line when I went but I was disappointed with their Chicken Fries. But to each their own. Lots of people love the fries and hype them up but t was like more bread than chicken.  I'll stick to the tenders next time  Also the male cashier who's from LA was very nice :) short convo but he made the airport less boring!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for over a year and while it does need improvements, it has never messed up my order and the orders are usually large for a family of four.   The wait sometimes is long and the general look of the building could use some sprucing but we have never had a problem here. I feel like lately, they are trying to improve."}
{"text":"Bought an original chicken sandwich was so gross burned I went at dinner and I swear the chicken was from the day before."}
{"text":"Seriously?!?! Seriously?!?! My husband wanted an original chicken sandwich with cheese on it. When I asked for cheese to be added the lady at the register ROLLED HER EYES, SIGHED AND SLAMMED HER HAND ON THE COUNTER!!!! What happened to \"Have it your way\"???? Isn't that their slogan? Awful customer service and extremely over priced. Get me out of this city!!!!"}
{"text":"We like this location, especially since it's so close to Nellis AFB.  Come here about once or twice a month. It's always been clean, servers are friendly.  Whoppers are always freshly made and taste what you'd expect from a whopper."}
{"text":"I have to say i been coming here for months!! At least three times a month for breakfast in the drive thru !! I must say what polite efficient workers !! Always so pleasant what a great team !!! I think when you have great customer service it needs to be known !!  Thank you !!!"}
{"text":"This Burger King is located on the North side of Las Vegas, near the Decatur Ramp for the I-215. I went to this establishment during the evening on a Friday.  Atmosphere: Flashy and Modern! I'm not even kidding, this is one of the nicest Burger Kings I've ever been to. I've only seen these types of Burger Kings on YouTube that are located in other countries. There are many places to sit, and it looks like there is new furniture around the restaurant. There are two touch screens installed next to two tables that let patrons play games as they enjoy their meal, both of which look totally cool.  Service: Polite and Quick I got my food within a reasonable amount of time. The cashiers were nice to me when I ordered my food and called my number out clearly.  Food: Not as bad as I thought it would be I had a chicken sandwich combo, which included a small drink and a small order of French fries. The chicken in my sandwich was nice and crunchy, but had a slight taste of grease on it. The fries were pretty good and it's always cool to use the Coca Cola Machine.  Overall: Good time! I would come back here just to hang out on the slick new furniture and technology. I have to remember that Burger King is a family place. There were several children present when I entered this Burger King, and if it wasn't for their parents nagging at them, my dining experience might have been a little more peaceful. For a Friday night, it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be."}
{"text":"Great location fast and friendly service Thanks for making my day Charity. The best manager around what a DOLL!!!!!      all the haters out there can get a life."}
{"text":"3 out of the 3 times I've been to this location they've forgotten something out of the order. How hard is it to put what the customer PAID FOR in the bag???? It's ridiculous! And they never seem phased by the fact that they forget items. It's like they expect it when you walk in from going through the drive through. So frustrating!!! I'm sending in a corporate complaint after this."}
{"text":"Slow. This is not fast food. Why are the drinks going back and forth from the service window to the car in front of me? Drinks should only go out. And why, after an interminable wait, is my food not ready and the guy at the window is disin the middle of the afternoon when there is no one behind me?"}
{"text":"Went because I had some bogo coupons. Get there at 1030, all the lights were on including the drive thru menu. Someone finally got on the speaker and said they were closed. I thought it was odd to close at 1030 so I googled their hours. Says they closed at 12 that night. Awesome service.."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Burger King, I have ever been to. This was our third trip, I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt that maybe the crew was just having an off day.   Consistency is the only word to describe this establishment. Consistently bad!  The crew is unfriendly, and always barking at one another. The order never comes out the way you request it. Is it not the burger joint that advertise \" have it your way \"   The playground was closed twice at the last two visits. They made no effort to repair what was wrong with from out first visit. The only reason for coming to this Burger King was to let the kids play and make sure they had lunch.   Twice I was disappointed with my meal I didn't finish it.   NO I DO NOT RECOMMEND and would not return !"}
{"text":"We went through the drive thru of this location. Unfortunately my wife order onion rings instead of fries, but they gave her fries anyways. She wound up having to go back inside to switch them out."}
{"text":"I got kinda hooked on this location for two reasons: 1) their only a block away from my house and often on my way in and out, and 2) during last summer and their promotion of $0.50 ice cream, I became a fan.  The staff is helpful, and I've seen them go out of their way to provide excellence in customer care.  The food that I have tried has always been piping hot or in the case of ice creams and shakes, delightful.  It is a rather new location, only a few years old and well maintained and very inviting environment to sit and indulge..."}
{"text":"Order is always correct ( it's a fast food joint, that got them the one star ). Service ALWAYS blows. Order more than one item and you'll sit in the parking lot waiting. \"Have it your way\" does not apply to this location. Have ordered 4 menu items, waited 30 minutes, and then had to walk in to check on my order. Food--- fine, standard, it's fast food. Service--- so sub-par I cannot call it service. They treat you like it's your fault because you ordered anything."}
{"text":"Fast service there today. I was in and out in no time through their drive up. Food was fresh and hot and very good."}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars and that is solely based on convenience and the fact that I like the food to begin with. When my family and I entered this location a couple girls entered after us that apparently knew one of the workers. While we were ordering the girl working behind the counter screams, runs, knocks over equipment behind the counter slams into the door and runs out to hug and greet her friends. She stayed out of the kitchen for a few minutes one manager watched her run out and went to get a second manager. The both of them proceeded to stare at the girl as she was with her friends but no one asked her to come back in. It wasn't until she went back behind the counter that one manager told her that she knocked over some equipment and all she had to say \"oh well it's just ten dollars to replace.\" After this she went back into the kitchen with gloves on and ate some ice cream and without changing her gloves, started preparing food. Aside from the cashier, who was friendly and professional, the whole experience was just ridiculous and unnecessary. These people could learn some professionalism and proper work etiquette."}
{"text":"This location has been great and I have never had any issue. However, over the last two to three months service has sadly  declined. I decided to give it another try despite have issue during our last two visits.   I thought cool bring the kids let them play then have lunch. I placed the order which I had to repeat  several times and waited.  The play area and seating areas were very visibly not clean. So the kids could not play.15 minutes passed and they were still 3 orders away from mines plus a line in the drive thru. Very frustrating. I asked for a refund and left. Even the refund process was problematic.  It was lunchtime, which gets packed really quickly. I hope they are are able to hire more workers, because  customer service is seriously lacking right now."}
{"text":"All of my order was cold. Ordered 2 meals and 2 orders of chicken fries . They tasted as if they were cooked hours ago in old grease. Ask for fresh food, worth the wait."}
{"text":"I work right by this Burger King , good service , food is always hot . This is my go too BK! Always fast , always friendly . This BK takes care of you !!"}
{"text":"It's a Burger King so the food is standard Burger King (good bk). But what's best is the service everyone is on board doing what they are supposed to be doing. Good leadership at this location."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this ZERO stars!  I enjoy Burger King to an extent and when my family and I stopped at this location before visiting my Grandma I was very disappointed.  We got in line and there were 2 gentlemen before us who were waiting for which appeared at least 5 minutes.  It took another 5 minutes before the first guy ordered, another 5 for the next guy and at least 10 minutes for us.  We just ordered 3 bacon cheeseburgers, one large fry and 3 iced teas..  Well, I sat down waiting for my family while they waited for the food.. Wasn't done for another 10 minutes or so.  Mind you it was after 1:30 and was not busy AT ALL!  The workers were rude, not professional at all and the only thing they even cared about was which coworkers pants they were going to get into that night.  When my mom came to the table I took a sip of my \"iced tea\".. It was completely hot, tasted disgusting and had no ice whatsoever.  The burgers were completely cold, barely a half of a piece of bacon!  The fries were overcooked, hard and tasted stale.    It's safe to say I will NEVER return to this Burger King and probably will NEVER return to Steelyard and this is how I've noticed MOST of the service to be like around there.  If I need any of these stores/restaurants I will stay in my neighborhood.  Do yourself a favor and skip this place.. Unless you enjoy wasting your money!"}
{"text":"I gave this Burger King 5 stars, because they earned it. I am 15 weeks pregnant and I walked to BK because I was craving a croissantwich. When I got there, my card was saying that it was invalid. The cashier made a mistake and rung me up as if I paid 100$ cash and had to re-do the entire order. My card was still invalid. I left to call my card and was told that they would save my order until I came back. I found out that my card had a hold on it for fraud detection. It took almost 30 minutes to get it taken care of and walk back to BK before they stopped serving breakfast. When I got there, they were no longer serving breakfast but still had me a fresh order of croissantwiches. I am extremely satisfied. Because I would have been depressed until I finally fulfilled that craving. Everyone was extremely courteous and even though they had system issues, and my card had issues, they still did everything in their power to satisfy a customer. Plus I did not disclose with them that I was pregnant, so I didn't receive any special treatment because of it. GO BK MORNING SHIFT."}
{"text":"This is some place you only want to go to if you have to. The atmosphere sucks, the food always seems bland, the building feels like it's in disrepair, and the staff are lifers and kids passing through. There are few places which can make you feel even worse about grabbing fast food and unfortunately, this is one of them.   The BK on Broadway near Hardy is a million times better."}
{"text":"Okay, I get it. It's just Burger King. If they are going to keep taking customers money for a service they really need to get a clue. All around horrible service. They got our order wrong twice and never even apologize for it. Bad customer service is becoming the norm. What would happen if someone put the customer first and provided an outstanding experience all of the time? They would get my business I can tell you that. If you in Vegas and looking for a quick bite to eat, I recommend that you find another place."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good for BK.  The service was fast and the value menu has decent deals.  However my past two visits had errors though.  Fries rather than onion  rings last time, despite being clear.  I also asked ranch to go with my onion rings this time and they forgot that.  They'd have gotten 3 or 4 stars if they'd not left stuff out twice in a row."}
{"text":"Edit to add: I've had one pick up here since my review and things went a bit smoother. The employees were a bit more friendly and didn't seem to put the food courier order on the backburner like during previous visits. It might just have been that it wasn't as busy and it was during my other visits. For this reason I am changing my score to 2/5 and will try to give them the benefit of the doubt for now.  Old Review: I've never picked up from this location and left with the food in under 10 minutes. Unlike other burger kings that have the order ready when you arrive, or are working on it, this store doesn't put food courier orders in until after you arrive.  Even then, they'll take care of an entire line of 7+ people who come in after you arrived while you wait 5+ minutes for a manager to confirm the order, all the while they aren't making your order despite them saying they are (the reason you know this isn't true is because all the people who arrived after you and placed orders are getting their food while you wait and wait).  Bad location that I will avoid from now on. They need better training on for to deal with food courier orders. They cheat also by marking the food ready to pickup as soon as you arrive even though they still make you wait 10+ minutes every time."}
{"text":"I went yesterday through the drive thru and got the flaming hot Mac n Cheetos. Idk if there was mold inside or if they were just super burnt but I threw them out immediately. Waste of money!!!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst Burger King I've ever been to, no one can comp a coupon, they don't ask if you want fries or anything. They think she you order a sandwiche with a coupon that's all you want is a sandwiche. The manager was just as attenitive as the crew."}
{"text":"WoW HOT food for a change. I'm really surprised since it's 2:49 pm. I'm really liking my late lunch. Whenever I eat at a fast food restaurant which isn't often I always get cold food. Not at this location. The only shitty thing was there was ketchup all over the floor next to the soda machine. Walk carefully. Ok."}
{"text":"I rushed to get here for a bacon croissanwich this morning.  I ordered at 10:28 and was told breakfast was over. I said, \"but I thought it was served till 10:30.\" She said, \"but we don't have any made up.\"   In my mind, if it's not 1030 then you make them up. Am I wrong? What kind of business is this?  This is the only thing I eat at Burger King."}
{"text":"Five stars for a fast food joint?  Let me just say that the few minutes I went through the drive-thru were more enjoyable than the last 100 fast food visits...at LEAST. (Geez, do I eat that much fast food?)  I ordered some chicken strips and a coffee for my drive home after a few days in CLT. The lady was very Southern and polite and called me \"baby\" which never gets old for me. Then I pull up to the first window, and this young man with freckles takes one look at my Volvo V60 station wagon and asks, \"Is that you and your wife's car?\" I chuckle and say yes. He pauses, looks at the car again, and asks, \"Did she pick it out?\" I laugh again at this kid's cheekiness.  The woman behind the next window (the one who calls you \"baby\") assures me that she wants to brew me a fresh pot of coffee, because, after all, it is the afternoon, and the rest of that stuff isn't very good anymore. I wait an extra 3 minutes, house the chicken strips, and set off on a 2 hour 15 min drive home purty darn happy. Some good people work here, and they show it! (How often do you say that about your average BK?)"}
{"text":"Their fries are about a dollar more than the BK at 59th and Thunderbird. 1 large fry was $3.46 (give or take a nickel). And then they don't fill it all the way, even though they're giving out stale, old, tear-with-your-teeth fries. And when you go back in to say \"uhhh...\" they give you more gross, old fries to shut you up. Oh, and you can't do the bk review website thing because the center of the receipt, top to bottom, is missing a lot of digits. So no complete store number/transaction number, etc. I should've known it was bad when it's about 4:30pm on a Monday and only one other person was in the drive thru. I worked fast food for years and management tends to get stuck in their own, gross little world. Dude needs to snap out of it."}
{"text":"The experience my daughter and I had at this location was terrible! It was a Friday evening and our plan was to order in and enjoy our meals inside. Once we walked in, we were not greeted or acknowledged. We stood at the counter reviewing the menu as most do, and waited for someone to greet and ask if we were ready. We even walked up to the register and looked at two men, who didn't care if we were there or not. We finally order and got our drinks.  Once we actually stopped to get a good look around, all the tables were dirty, the drink and ketchup area was disgusting. I watched a customer spill a drink near the drink fountain, while a worker overlooked and did NOTHING. He did not clean it up or bother to put up a sign. We waited over 10 minutes, which is fine, but there were workers standing around in the back, so we didnt understand that. I told my daughter I could not eat inside, so once our order was called, I asked to have it to go instead. We live a mile away from the store, so the food should have still been hot. Nope! The food was horrible and we will NOT be back. Management really needs to take ownership or the health inspection!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while since I'm on a diet, but the service at this particular location has always been amazing. Multiple employees doing an excellent job makes me think they must have a good manager or something. Regardless, they're doing something right."}
{"text":"Stay Away from the Gilbert Burger King on Friday Nights! I am so upset with Burger King.  Last Friday, Aug 11 at 8:15 pm   my friend and I, both Mature Women went to the Burger King #5974- 450 North Gilbert Road, Gilbert AZ 85234. Our order was place at 8:17 order#17.   At that time, there was a group of kids obviously not old enough to drive. There were loud and horsing around. While we were in line one boy came up and asked for \"More Water Cups\".  Our server, Geraldo, gave him some and told him he could not give him any more cups. While were playing, we heard the sound of Ping Pong Balls bouncing around the restaurant, The Kids were play a form of \"pong\". They began to rough house physically began to the push each other into the booths.  More kids arrived and chaos erupted.  The ping pong balls even bounced in out booth.  Out booth was a curved one facing the Drink dispenser and we were able to observe one boy with a \"Burger King Cup\" filling his and pouring it into the \"Water Cups\".  It was so loud we never heard them call our number. Janet went up to check on our order and it was just sitting there and it was COLD.  Just as Janet picked up our food a boy on a White BMX style bike came cursing in and rode his bike around inside the Burger King. Along with him a few more kids came it and the noise, routines and inappropriate behavior.  At one point- about 30 minutes a few of the group left and we decided to leave. Just as we place out garbage in the cans, the group came back.  I need to use a White Cane for Mobility- I have Low Vision.  We were blocked in and had to ask the kids to make space so we could leave.  They made some rude comments as I was trying to navigate to the exit. On Monday Aug 14 at 2:00 PM, I called the Burger King and asked to speak to the Manager.  Someone name \"Giovani\" (spelling) who REFUSED to state his last name or spell his name, claimed to be the General Minter, say he was working on that Friday and that he did not remember it being loud or anyone riding a bike in the dining area. Well he boldly LIED to Me.  He stated it felt it was okay for the kids hang-out. He didn't even address the Cold Food!  When I mention the liability if someone got hurt, he just laughed!  I asked him what was Burger King's policy for Loitering. He said he didn't know. I was shocked when he stated, he has only been the General Manager for a few weeks and did not know of any rules! I than called Burger King's Customer Relations Number - 1-866394-5493. I got someone named Lordes. She was not very sympathetic and never Apologized for the horrific experience and/or Cold Food.   I asked her who was the Franchise Owner. She stated she was not allowed to tell me but she would contact him and have him contact me in the next 24-48 hours. She never gave a Case Number.   I waited until 2:30 PM today, Friday Aug 18 to re-contact the Customer Relations Department.   This time a got Shereca. She looked up my complaint. She put me on hold to read it. She came back on the line and stated she would re-contact the Franchisee Owner. She did not feel it was unreasonable that I had not been contacted in 5 Days.   I asked to speak with a supervisor. She put me on hold and came back and said there was NONE AVAILIBLE! I stated I would hold until one was. She stated a supervisor would call me back but she did not know when. I told her was NOT acceptable and I would blast Facebook,Twitter, Yelp, and ,Rip Off,  and I will contact the Heath Department about the Cold Food.   I persisted and about 3-5 minutes later a supervisor named Dennis came on line.  He was the FIRST Person to Apologize. He stated he was Emailing the Owner, the District Manager and the General Manager... Obliviously, it is NOT \"Giovani\".  1. Unexpectedly drop in your Berger King at 8:30 PM  on a Friday Night....  2. Return Customers Calls  3. Install Security Cameras 4. Comply with the Health Department Correct Temperature for Serving Food! 5.Keep HOT foods HOT! Hold hot cooked foods between 140°F and 165°F until serving time."}
{"text":"Let me start but saying customer service was great the young lady this am was wonderful but I couldn't help but notice the \"PROSTITUTION \" surrounding . Prostitutes came in and out the restrooms as me and my child ate breakfast inside this location . Made me feel so uncomfortable that guys was hanging inside that didn't buy anything . I say unless your going through the drive threw stay clear of this location . It's prostitution in the parking lot and on each surrounding corner of this Burger King not a good look or feels to say especially if you're a women . I literally rushes and ate and left once I payed clear attention to what was going on ."}
{"text":"I hate that this is the closest Burger King to my house! Only in the matter that yes they have to be one of the slowest drive thru's I've been thru! Unlike the Burger King in tropicana and fort Apache they don't park you to get the fresh food cooked! Now I don't mind when they do that because let's be honest we all would love to wait for FRESH fast food! Especially when it comes to the nuggets and chicken sandwiches hehe! All jokes aside I really need them to get it together and stop letting these little boys run the place after hours! I thought there was a curfew for children..."}
{"text":"Ugh it's pretty damn hard to earn five whole stars from a fast food joint because lets be honest..the service is most likely sub par. The attitudes of fast food workers can sometimes be questioned. Anyways I came here because a little birdy told me that the French toast sticks are only a dollar?! Say what?? Fat kid at heart I really do try to stay away from all fast food however I am a sucker for breakfast items smh. The French toast sticks here are very good! The morning I came I lucked out and had nobody ahead of me in the drive thru! Score! Pulled on through and got my hot and fresh French Toast. The fact that I didn't get any kind of warm greeting or thank you for your business was expected, and in return you get 3 whole stars :-)"}
{"text":"Some people might look at my review and wonder how on earth is he ranking a fast food place 5 stars! Well.. let's start with the fact that each and every time I visit this particular location the wait time is never more than 5 minutes!  The drive thru moves pretty quick and if need be they actually will have you park if your food is going to be more than a few minutes. Who doesn't mind fresh food? I know I don't! Customer service here is CONSISTENTLY great! All the workers I have encountered have always be very pleasant to deal with. I couldn't ask for more! Needless to say that this Burger King will remain my GO TO location whenever I'm in the mood for some extra calories :-)"}
{"text":"Burger King just needs to take a look at what other fast food places are doing with breakfast and incorporate some of the same practices! One of the most frustrating things is that they stop serving breakfast at such an odd time of 10:30 AM and when people like me who would enjoy French toast sticks at a later time can't get them it's annoying. My most recent experience at this particular location was what even inspired me to do a review. I was in the drive thru line at approximately 10:18 AM and of course sat there for about 7-10 minutes which put us super close to the ending of breakfast. When I finally was able to order the woman who was taking the drive thru orders tried to tell me no more breakfast when in fact it wasn't even 10:30 AM. The last thing I want to do is sit up and argue with somebody this early in the morning about some damn French toast sticks so that was really annoying. Anyways the manager end up having the kitchen drop a fresh batch of French toast sticks for me because technically I was correct I got in that line prior to 10:30 AM and even placed my order BEFORE the time that they claim breakfast stops. All this could've and SHOULD'VE been avoided by simply doing like McDonalds, Jack In The Box and the others and offer ALL DAY BREAKFAST.. Period!"}
{"text":"It's one of those reviews you have to question whether or not it's even worth taking the time but because I'm such a loyal and helpful YELPER haha I'll go ahead and share my experience! I had an early morning flight last week and of course didn't have enough time to stop for breakfast! After getting to the airport this Burger King was calling my name even more since it was local led directly across from my gate in the C concourse.. Here's the thing we all know airport food is extremely overpriced because of the convenience I'm sure but I was definitely reminded of actually how expensive it was after ordering my double sausage and egg croissant value meal.. Was it worth the $11 and some change? Absolutely not but what else are you going to do starve? I'd say this is marketing and price inflation at its finest! Thanks Burger King :-)"}
{"text":"Yikes! I am so glad I didn't experience the kind of service that my fellow Yelper's have had here. I visited this location last week and had a very simple order of the chicken nuggets and a chicken sand which. During my order I asked for everything to be prepared freshly and the gentleman taking my order assured me that he would make that happen. When I pulled to the front of the window I was greeted right away and was informed that there was a little over 2 minutes left for my food to be done in the fryer! Of course I had no problem waiting a little extra time for some fresh food! Solid visit! I'm sorry everybody else didn't get the service I did :-/"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible  The service is horrible 2/8/18   8:30 pm  Person in charge is epically clueless"}
{"text":"I live here, and the workers at this location are the rudest I have come across. I have worked in the service industry my whole life so not only do I treat others that do with respect, but I also know they do not give the same in return. The food is fine - employees are terrible."}
{"text":"Super chill after hike hot messy grubbin. I ordered 2  veggie burgers, which took a while to make so the cashier had us drive to the front double doors. Hunger is the best spice."}
{"text":"It's 5:21am, their menu is all lunch/dinner stuff. Ok maybe they forgot to flip it, NOPE. They aren't doing breakfast right now. IT'S 5:21AM!! How are you not doing breakfast?!? Get it together people!"}
{"text":"Cold burgers cheese not melted cold nuggets missing food from drive thru this place sucks"}
{"text":"I usually love bk, this one is sub-par. I'm pretty sure they don't change their oil enough. I also received a much smaller double cheeseburger than I expected. The thing was kids sized. Bad value overall. They also shorted us on the cold-fries."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst onion rings I have ever tasted !  And my Whopper ended up in the trash, too!  I don't know what happened to Burger King but it's definitely not what it use to be!"}
{"text":"Asked for no sauce and no mayo on my sandwich. Waited extra long for them to ensure this and I get home to a crap load of mayo on my sandwich. Very disappointing to not be able to eat what you order. The frys were hot and fresh."}
{"text":"The drive-thru staff is no longer friendly and, even if they take your order correctly, they frequently omit items from your bag. It is such a chronic problem that I won't go there anymore."}
{"text":"This is my least favorite Burger King in the entire world. I ate there once a year ago, and the fries were old and cold, and tasted like an entire bag of salt was dumped on them. The burger was bland, except for the taste of salt. Even in a small town (Sun Prairie), the parking lot somehow manages to get swamped with diesel fumes--must be the wind blowing off Highway 151.  I decided to try it again today, wondering if it was just a random bad experience. No. They made fresh fries, and so I didn't mind waiting 15 minutes at the window. The guy behind me in the drive through looked like he minded. I had the opportunity during the extended wait to notice that all of the cars behind me were driven by the truly obese--with fat billowing out of their shirts, with faces that became chins that became torsos, without a clear definition of where one stopped, and the next began--extreme, even for Wisconsin.  The fries were fresh, and salty to the point that my gums hurt. The burger completely fell apart, and was bland, except for the overwhelming taste of salt. The bread was stale. I guess that was a second flavor, that I could taste through the salt. So the Whopper tasted like salty, stale bread, which disintegrated, somehow appropriately.  I realize I'm being a drama queen, but I drove home and took a shower."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Burger King anywhere. The staff is friendly and fast. The food is always fresh and good. It is in a mildly bad neighborhood, which makes it stand out even more. I don't know what it is--the owner, the manager, the staff? Probably all three. Great place."}
{"text":"Workers are polite. Order is pretty fast. Place seems clean but I never eat there. I always order take out and does not take more than 5 minutes wait. Also, I like their fries as they never put salt."}
{"text":"Fast food is rarely review worthy, however, if no one reviews it then what is the point?!   What I like best about this place is that it's open late, of all the fast food hamburgers the one I hate the least and I can actually stomach is the Whopper! Even thought the quality of it has come down significantly from when I was a kid, its still the better burger in the fast food industry.   The service at this place is like any other, something it's slow and sometimes its slower! They get your order wrong most of the time, they miss something on your order, or they forget to add something. But you get what you play for!"}
{"text":"clean, fast, and efficient. not so sure about the access back to vegas blvd, but hey, can't have it all for a bargain price. far cheaper than anything on or near the strip and worth the drive."}
{"text":"No matter if I visit in the morning, afternoon or evening this Burger King is excellent in their display of professionalism, customer service and courtesy. It seems they have a very good management team here.  Their local burger competition has a thing or two to learn. Stand back, Ronald!!!There's a new king in town!!!"}
{"text":"Just to give a star to do a review .... Now this is interesting but hey ... shyt happens ... So we requested a Double Whopper with cheese n got a single whopper ---- Easy fix right?? Nope this time it indeed is a double whopper w/pinchie jalapeños. Daymn a double whammy .. Now onto the next - we tried the Cheetos Chicken fries. Ummmm there were only 6 fries in the container --- Shit a small order of fries have more in their packages!!!  Now while eating still the girl  cleaning n sweeping is doing it at my table while I'm eating AND final another worker is up on the ladder cleaning the vents while customers are eating."}
{"text":"Great, I am robbed again here at burger king. I never though I would back here at Burger King after a few months. Well, I assumed they improved a bit, but to my dismay, the food is still the same. Low portion, they didnt even gave me water while I was waiting. Staff were absent minded. This is a bit obvious on almost every employee here. Not gonna come back again."}
{"text":"Always dependable. Hot and fresh breakfast, made to order burgers."}
{"text":"Always a good breakfast. Whopper is always a good charbroiled burger. New drinks and desserts are a plus."}
{"text":"If you like to venture into a dirty hellhole restaurant, be waited on by rude employees who can barely speak English, \"enjoy\" undercooked burgers, and sit in a filthy lobby surrounded by fine 1991 works of \"art\" on the walls, this is your place!!!!  Seriously, whoever is in charge of interior decorating must have died in 1992, because no one has touched the place since then. Remember the early 1990's, people? The t-shirts of the Disney characters (ie Bugs Bunny, Tasmanian Devil, etc) that had on baggy, rapper-style clothing with their hats on backwards? They literally have pictures of those hanging on the wall, that are so faded out that theyre almost hard to make out. I mean.... wow. Just.... wow."}
{"text":"There are no good Burger King's in AZ, I swear. This one, and the one on Scottsdale Rd and Thunderbird, are equally atrocious. This particular one is filthy, never has ketchup, and the burgers are always cold in the middle, like they haven't figured out their flame-broiler machine yet or something. And half the time I go in there, the employees are out in the lobby, sitting at tables (not on break) with friends of family. They walk back to the counter to help us, then go back out there and chit chat, super loud, in Spanish. This has happened the last 2 times Ive been in there. I wont be back. Ever."}
{"text":"Just left there and the manager was incredibly rude to me.  She rolled her eyes at me when my card could not be read, not because I don't have money but because it is a old card. I would have paid cash but at this point she had been so rude I didn't even want my food.  Then when I asked to speak with a different manager she argued with me. I will never be going there ever again."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is slow, and the attitudes of the employees even the managers is very poor. With not much choice around for cheaper alternatives to the hospital cafeteria this is one of two options both poor."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the flame broiled whopper, and I am a fan of Burger Kings coupons but I typically don't eat fast food. But I happen to get some coupons in the mail and Saturday is my \"cheat\" day so I said why not. I could go on my lunch break I work on Saturday's and this location is right down the street from my office.   So on 3/14/15 12:43pm I get a 30 minute lunch break and I tell myself me and another co-worker will go. To say the least I was not happy with most of this experience. Let me go over the negatives, because the positives are listed above.   1. The restaurant was dirty. The counter was dirty, tables were dirty, the soda machine was dirty, the condiment area was dirty. I don' know what drive thru looked like because I went inside, but I will say there was only one group of people sitting down and only about 6 people in line in front of me...dirty is gross.  2. It took forever for the check out girl to ring every one up, she kept asking for assistance, or was just generally joking with her coworkers...took me 5 minutes to get there, stood in line for 10 minutes...I finally get to order. MY BREAK IS HALF OVER.   3. I order. I had a coupon for two original chicken sandwiches and two small fry for $4.99, not a bad deal, didn't feel like a burger that day. I wait. I get it for there...I figure I can get it and sit and eat real fast and wont have to go back to work and eat at my desk.  I watch as my order clock goes up to 9 minutes. FML. Then when my order is up I spend another three minutes looking at it sit under the heat lamps while the staff talks amongst themselves and works on drive thru orders that came in after mine. Finally its put on a tray and given to me. I ask for a cup for water, the girl didn't hear me because she is not paying attention, I ask again, she looks it me like its a hassle to hand me a clear plastic cup for water...I am getting extremely frustrated.   My break is effectively over.   4. I finally get my food. The french fries were good. But how can you fuck up french fries??? The chicken tasted like it was freezer burnt, it was gross.   So after effectively wasting a good 25 minutes I actually get my food after walking in the front door of this Burger King.  I used my entire break and went back to work extremely late.   Worst so called FAST FOOD experience ever.   I will never go back to this location. And I threw out the rest of the coupons I had."}
{"text":"So I want to be a fan of Burger King I really do..this use to be one of my favorite burger places growing up...it seems now when ever I go, I am just not happy. Let's start by my arrival, I got a good parking spot up front, it's in a unique type of building and parking lot so the entrance is almost facing the road...as I walked in I noticed there was no one behind the counter as I looked around, I see this women Maria(name tag) in the back talking to a couple with a baby at the back table, she shyly greats me and says hey...as she goes behind the counter she asks to take my order, not very friendly to say the least.   So I ordered the double whopper combo medium with cheese and bacon, I asked if could substitute my fries out for chicken fries and she says this is not possible, I would have to get the chicken fries as a separate order....so I do...total comes out to $12.30 seems like a lot for burger combo with just chicken fries...but it is what it is...fast food isn't even cheap anymore.   So the restaurant is pretty clean for the most part and besides the couple Maria was talking to no one else was in there.  Let's talk about my food, I got it for there, I always do this now, because I have given up on drive-thru's getting my order right, most of the time they fuck it up even if the screen is correct.  The burger...no taste at all...like eating some moist cardboard, the bacon was stiff and even thou I got a double whopper, they only put one slice of cheese on it. the tomato's used were a bit green, and were the top of the tomato by the stem, so it was like a tomato wheel with no center and in general it was not that good. The chicken  fries, were sitting on the counter when I placed my order, they were definitely old...they were a dark brown a sign that the fryer grease need to be changed and extremely chewy and not warm at all...I will never eat these again if this is what they are suppose to taste like. The french fries were the only thing that was good.  How can you fuck up fries thou...seriously. this place should get 1 and a half stars at best.  As I am finishing up I see the women Maria was talking motion to Maria and she motions back to go up to the counter after I had been there about 15 minutes, I saw no money exchanged but Maria provided this women with a pretty hefty tray of food. I did not see any money exchanged so I assume she gave it away...at least someone got hooked up here...as far as my food and service experience goes I didn't."}
{"text":"I went here tonight because I had a coupon for buy one Whopper get one free...the time was 10:35 when I pulled up to the drive thru menu, and the girl on the other end is obviously laughing and giggling over the intercom with a co worker...so finally she is like \"Can I take you order?\" I tell her what I want...and that I have the coupon for the two whoppers BOGO. She says \"What's the coupon #, anything else?\" I say I would like cheese on that and she then gives me my total. Not asking if I wanted anything else, I didn't. But she still didn't ask. So she is like \"please drive around.\" So as I round the corner of the drive thru there is two cars in front of me and the first car is pulling out. So I am thinking, great I will have my food soon. I had worked a 13 hour shift so I was really hungry.   15 minutes later I am still sitting in my truck waiting I have not moved nor is the car in front of me...I can see the people in front of me are as just as frustrated. I finally am like screw this and proceed to back out of the drive thru no easy feet in a big truck. It is 10:50. As I am backing out they shut off all the lights to the drive thru and all the building signs...ridiculous. Worst experience ever at a Burger King,  I will be calling to speak to the owner or franchise manager tomm.   Will never come here again."}
{"text":"It's been a couple years since I got a whopper at BK... And it was horrible.. I remember I used to get these on base all the time and the burgers were flame broiled and pretty damn good. These burgers taste like frozen AM PM PATTIES.. Just gross.. The franchise must be under a new CEO  or owner but I will not come back..  I didn't want a .50 cent burger for $6 Where we check the box where it says \"Good For\" there should be a \"nothing\" box"}
{"text":"If you don't want to get sick I wouldn't recommend to go here I eat two burgers and it tasted delicious at the time but after that all night and all morning I barf them back up was not a good experience I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Burger King is Burger King. But the service was phenomenal Beatriz talked to us and was really nice! Best fast food experience I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This BK sucks.  I sometimes have to desperately go there after the bars starving because it is the only thing open.  Cold cold cold! The food is always cold, hard and flavorless."}
{"text":"I gave them a star because they eventually served something (horrible) resembling fast food and because I actually think they were trying (and failing oh so badly).  Eventually there will be a horrible tour of the worst restaurants.  The Taco Bell across the street couldn't even serve food (\"not taking any more orders\". !!  Seriously!).  First, I had to repeat order 2 times.  That isn't too bad, really.   The wait to get to window to pay was 10 min however this is only because two cars in front of me left.  When I got to window she was confused.  Kept trying to confirm other orders.  OK, the people left so understandable.  Eventually I got her to just listen as I repeated order.  Three times.  She got it wrong three times.  Eventually she found it.  Even had correct total.  Then I made a mistake.  She asked me to pull ahead.  The guy in front of me had been waiting for his order all this time and finally went into the place and came out upset... twice!    Sadly I pulled forward and waited... and waited.  My daughter was such a trooper.  After 20 min when everyone behind was gone, I backed up.  The woman was still there.  Looked surprised.  I asked \"Anytime soon?\"  She was confused.  I said \"when am I going to get my order?\"  Repeated that two more times and she got another person who asked me to repeat.  I said \"Seriously?!?\"  He said \"Yes seriously.\"  5 more minutes got truly terrible cold food.  Yep.  Epic!"}
{"text":"Clean, sells 20 pounds of ice for only $2 for when you need ice, nice workers, fast service, quick drive-thru, separated kids' area, and the whopper tastes great!"}
{"text":"Went in today on a paid mystery shop.  There was nobody in line ahead of me and I ordered a simple Whopper with NO cheese.  Literally waited over 15 minutes before asking the cashier lady if I could have a drink since I was STILL waiting for my food.  She totally ignored me so I asked again and again she ignored me.  I then caught the drive thru guy walking by and asked him to get me the manager.  After another 5 minutes or so the manager comes out and I tell him what was going on.  He apologizes and gives me a drink and I wait some more.  Finally get my Whopper and sit down to eat it and it has friggin cheese on it after I explicitly asked for NO CHEESE.  So I take it back to the counter and the same black cashier woman makes me stand there for another 5 minutes before she finally comes over and rudely says ' What's your problem now?\"  Had I not been there on a mystery shop and need to finish the job I would have thrown that Whopper in that woman's face and walked out.  Also note that people had come in behind me and were also getting angry at how long it was taking to get food.  They were NOT understaffed as there were 5 or 6 people lagging around in the kitchen and working at a SNAIL'S PACE!  Yes they were ALL black....not a white person in sight.  Looked a lot like racial discrimination to me.  Anyway, I will NEVER step foot in that place again and considering even calling the labor board."}
{"text":"This place is slow beyond belief. How do they stay in business? I waited 15 min for my order which was wrong and cold. I got the excuse \"were short staffed\". There were two cars in line and no one in the dining area. How much staff do you need for two customers? I think they laugh about how bad they are as workers. Because they could care less...."}
{"text":"really their new burger combos are over 12 dollars? complete trash!! and they arent even good!! stick with the whopper deals!!"}
{"text":"What a disappointing visit.  What does it take to get a fast food order right???? Stopped to get a breakfast sandwich on my way to Home Depot, clerk is not paying any attention to the counter, after a few minutes I leaned over the counter to see if some else was paying attention to the waiting customers, clerk finally looked up and asked for my order, he kept staring at the floor. I ordered a breakfast  sandwich meal, after about 10 minutes, up comes this pancake platter.   \"I ordered a Croissant Sandwich\", \"No you didn't, you ordered a breakfast platter \". He obviously wasn't listening when I ordered.  But, then he started to argue with me,  I asked for the Manager, Ahh, HE WAS THE MANAGER!  That tore it. . .  If the owner wanted this incompetent to run the store, then I'll eat somewhere else.  Asked for money back, took the 'manager' ten minutes to figure out how to run a credit through the register.   Why do you almost always know when they are going to screw the order up?  If you walk in and no one pays attention, leave.  If you get a cheery      greeting, and one person waits on you, your order will be right and they appreciate your business.   Vote with your wallet and feet, crappy service, get your money back and leave."}
{"text":"Fuel stop at BK on my way home.  Hmmm, seems there is no manager in the morning.  Crew is having a party and they have the restroom closed so they don't have to clean them.  OK clean and food is acceptable.  Management needs to manage. . ."}
{"text":"New trainee greeted us very politely, took our order, read it back to us in it's entirety (not \"combo #5, etc).  Then who I presume to be the manager, or at the very least his trainer, asked if our order was correct.  My boyfriend said, \"We'll find out when we get it.\" The trainer/mngr laughed.  I said, \"He took our order correctly.  We'll see what we actually get.\" When we received our tray, which was expedited by an older, not so friendly employee, with a long braid, she did not give us our large hash browns.  When my bf questioned it, she annoyingly looked at our receipt and saw that we did indeed order the large.  She took off the hash browns and returned with the two larges that we paid for.  No apology, just an attitude.  The trainee apologized for the mistake.  And fast food employees want $15/hr when repeatedly in that industry, orders are not expedited correctly?  Work on giving excellent customer service and making sure orders are expedited perfectly every single time THEN work on a higher hourly pay.  Until then, you're out of your mind.  BTW, the trainer/mngr was very professional and praised her trainee!!  Kudos to her AND the trainee!!"}
{"text":"i've gone here numerous times since my initial review, and only one time could've redeemed the initial low rating.  was here again and gave the woman 2.22 for my 2.17 bill and after she left and did something else for about 2 minutes despite the fact that i was otherwise all set, I finally got 3 pennies back.  2 cents isn't a huge deal, but it just is indicative of this BK's service"}
{"text":"This location needs serious help. Middle aged guy that takes orders has to be on drugs. I've never seen such crazy frantic behavior from someone who is in charge of handling cash!  Then there is the older guy who is an absolute dear but I don't know if he can't hear or what but I always have to repeat my order a hundred times. The only reason I go back is because I like croissants and they are close to my house.  Another place, like Wendy's,  that even though I always order the same thing it is somehow always a different price (maybe the tweaker is supporting his habit, IDK). I've never been inside and I'm betting if I did I would probably never go back.  Ignorance is bliss."}
{"text":"It's good greasy food for 4am - it's what I need before going to sleep on weekend nights (i goto gym, don't worry) lol. It's just basic fast food and that's all I can say."}
{"text":"Completely messed up my meal.. bad services incompetent employees as well as management"}
{"text":"I have been in the drive-through, two cars back for almost 10 minutes. I appreciate the fact that Burger King is fresh, but they don't really need to go out and kill the Cal and then slowly grind the meet. I would actually like my food in a expedient manner.  Slow"}
{"text":"i  am very disappointed.  i brought in a coupon for $3 for double cheeseburger, small fry, small drink and all i got was single cheeseburger, half a box of small frys and no drink.  michael who took my coupon would not give me my drink despite what the coupon said.  i asked him to relook at the coupon and he said he didnt need to and that he knows his coupons.  obviously he doesnt.  he was also rude about it.  when i got home with my to go order, i was right since i have duplicate coupons and i wont go back.  i will drive extra to grand ave since they know how to treat customers."}
{"text":"This Burger King drive through is always so damn slow even with the simplest orders it's about 10-15min wait 9/10 and always forgetting something and never gives you your receipts..."}
{"text":"went Fri.nite at about 10:30 guy at the window sounded like lurch thru the intercom, very extremely dis-interested, being a medical worker, once I got up to the window noticed he was either high as a kite on downers, or coming down with a bad case of the flu,hoing for the latter, got home 5 mins. later had to sling eveything in the garbage, fries were stale, whopper was gross, fish sandwich was hard as a rock, I think they micro-waved everything I ordered. never again, I am contacting the company"}
{"text":"Ok now- I don't know what happened, or if it's just a different crew, but something happened here and the service has been outstanding. I've had to come here to use the internet for the last week, and they are SO incredibly nice, and always hustling. I can't vouch for the food still, because I'm gluten-free, but smelling everyone else's food is driving me crazy- it smells delicious.   So as far as Burger Kings go, this one is pretty cool, and the improved staff has really turned things around."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were cold the meat inside the Whopper was burnt to a crisp I sit there and watched the person at the counter talk to a relative while my food was getting cold I finally asked him to please put my food on a tray so I could eat it before it was Stone Cold the bathroom had no towels and the place was filthy will not be back."}
{"text":"Worst drive through service I've ever had ordering. Told me I forgot to tell him what size yet he never asked. No please no thank you, just mindlessly going through the motions."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times. (Honestly because it's very near my house) on 2 or 3 occasions,  they've left something out of my order or had me drive up and wait. They're usually pretty slow.in the drive thru. Lesson:: triple check the order while still at the window and don't go here in a hurry. (More than 1 car can't be dealt with at a time)"}
{"text":"Seriously the slowest service ever. After waiting in drive through line for a rediculas amount of time they tell us to pull foraesrd, others didn't and our order was not large. No apology or anything, not \"fast food\""}
{"text":"THE WORSE BURGER KING EVER!! Not only do they randomly close early sometimes (went by at 11:15 pm and they were closed even thought their website says they're open til midnight), the service is awful and the food is barely edible.  Seriously, I shouldn't be amazed if I get hot food but I am. Oh and don't assume they have the whole menu there, there's always something they \"just ran out of\" or \"the machine is broken\" (like ICEEs).  I could maybe understand if this hadn't been the story for over a year.  Sucks that this is the only one this far south in Chandler but next time I'll just drive extra to go to the one on Alma School/Queen Creek."}
{"text":"Rachel was amazing!! She turned our average Sunday lunch into a fun outing.  Her customer service was outstanding.  I recommend everyone to go out of their way to go to her restaurant. Way to go Rachel!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst food ever!! Cold and old doesn't even cover it!!! They know they got you when you use the drive though!!!"}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from me. It shares a parking lot with a 99 cent store and there's a grocery store across the street and a Mexican restaurant a couple buildings down.  The dining area is clean and yes, there are many homeless people that come and frequent here and hang out...That doesn't really bother me like it would others, to me they're still people and I've never seen them pan handle or harass me for money. If anything, I've offered to buy food in the past for others.  The workers are not very engaging and lack wearing a smile.They look like drones who are there too \"do time\" and serve food.  The rest rooms are locked and offered to \"customers only\", but if you ever get to use it - the staff don't bother to keep it clean. It's locked and kept dirty other than the opposite where it should be clean, why even bother locking it in the first place - it's redundant.  I still enjoy my burgers, I've never had a bad experience where my order was wrong...the drones get it right for me every time.  It's amazing this place is still operating knowing that it lacks customer service and employees who are not passionate. If you just want to eat and leave....this is the place to go...if you want good customer experience...shop at Zappos or go to another burger place that you like...  :]"}
{"text":"I went to the BK in the Virgin America terminal.  They switched from breakfast to lunch and were busy pretty quickly.  I went to wait for my order with at least 6-8 others.  A woman yells from the back that they have no fries because the fryer is broken.  My $12 Whopper meal just became a nightmare!  They offered onion rings (I was confused how that was working in the fryer but okay) but no one wanted it.  Your other option was to wait in line again, take your receipt (the cashier never gave) and have them refund and re ring your sandwich.  Hey... No worries, I'm not trying to catch a flight or anything!  Worst service, long wait times, and incompetent. I would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"Waited in drive thru from 9:42 am till 10:05 I finally got my breakfast! Wow! This is ridiculous, hire more people or close"}
{"text":"This Burger King is wonderful!!!! On our way to Tiger World from Charlotte, we stopped here to grab food. They took our order very accurately, everyone was SO very polite from the very beginning at the drive thru, to the first window where they take your money, to the service menu - everyone was so polite. We came during the lunch hour so we knew it may be a little slow but we didn't mind the wait. We were a group of 3 hungry adults and 1 child, so we ordered quite a lot of food. We understood if it took a little longer, because it would probably be totally correct. And just as I suspected, our order was 100% correct! Anyone who frequents fast food places, know how rare this is! When the manager brought the food out to us, she apologized that it took a long time and we said we completely understand. She asked us if we would like a free Icee since we had to wait. Such wonderful customer service! We told her that wasn't necessary but she insisted we have a choice of free Icee. Would return to this BK if I'm ever in the area. BK's in Charlotte could learn a thing or two from this BK."}
{"text":"Whaaaat... There's a lounge corner and free Wi-Fi!  Hey can I just use YOUR Wi-Fi Mr. B King? I sat at their tall cafe tables. Very nice! You can watch the mounted flat screen TV perfectly. They play cool music. There's an indoor kids playground.   The employees are cool. They all seem to get along and laugh together. Quick customer service indoor and drive thru.  Great value menu. I'll have one of each item :P for my slight fast food binge. Would you care for some brain freeze? There's frosted Coca Cola flavors! Yet another bonus, their soda fountain is a fun touch screen that dispenses a large fruit variety of Sprite! I tried peach! Yaaaaheheeyyyyy!  And the best part of your BK experience shall be...Chocolate candy themed pies! GET. IT."}
{"text":"Came through the drive through last night. after taking my order we drove up to the window where they were BLARRING music and wouldn't even shut the window the entire 6 minutes we sat waiting for our fries. totally unprofessional and especially the music they were listening to. N***** this and that every 5 seconds. they didn't even turn it down when someone walked into the dining room."}
{"text":"So not only did they forget the first thing I ordered and had to run my card again after I checked the bag and realized I didn't have it but this is what they advertise as a sausage egg and hashbrown burrito. And they want 15.00 dollars and hour. What a joke"}
{"text":"Standard BK fare, nothing spesh or out of the ordinary.   Corporate initiative to serve food hot is a good thing and is alive here.  Sometimes items are so fresh out of the fryer that it burns the palette, like hash browns and original chicken sandwich patties.  Customer service here is the varying characteristic for this restaurant - it's hit or miss.  Speed of service is the same way.  You can access this Burger King via both Rockside and Aurora/43 Roads."}
{"text":"First of all, the whopper had a few shreds of lettuce and too much mayonnaise. How much could they save by putting a decent piece of lettuce on your sandwich? They had 2 whoppers for $6, by the time we added one order of fries and 2 drinks, we paid as much as 2 value meals with 2 orders of fries and 2 drinks.  The kid at the counter should have suggested that. So now I feel I didn't get a good sandwich or a good value.  Guess what? In-n-Out Burger, McDonalds, Smashburger, Red Robin, Fatburger, Five Guys, Shake Shack all have decent hamburgers. Too bad this place is convenient but I won't be stopping there anymore. You can go anywhere and buy what they sell, in a clean store with a smiling employee and feel like you got a good value."}
{"text":"This is not gonna be a long review but, this Burger king on Boulder Hwy.  never has ice cream cones / shakes half of the  time.  The last couple of times I went through the drive-thru they always say: \"our machine is down\"  Yea, only when I come in right??  The last time I went they were running a special if you buy a certain burger combo you get a free ice cream cone. So, I asked them about that and they told me \"yes you get a free cone\"...Ok, I said \"if your machine is down, do I get an IOU??\" Then there was complete silence...Maybe they didn't know what IOU stands for.  Once again.....good ole  NON CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!   They never respond to complaints or emails.  Thanks for NOTHING Burger queen. ( Sure glad Wendy's is just right down the street!! )"}
{"text":"There was no greeting or how are you, just burger king what do you want.  Ordered one of two meals and after.about two minutes, \"Burger King, how can I help you\". So I ordered again and after seeing one medium and one small meal (I ordered two large meals), I was told the she would have my total at the second window. After waiting for way to long in a line that I couldn't get out of, I got to the second window. Where I was asked, \"you had a whopper and bacon/cheese whopper\". I.said yes, even thought that wasn't a question, and she turned to her manager and said \"that's the one he wouldn't make\". The manager looked at her and said, \"you mean the order you just gave to the car in front of her?\"  all she said was Oh. I should have just driven off then.  So the manager told the cook that she needed another whopper and whopper with bacon and cheese.  She was obviously annoyed but the cashier looked at me and said $17.05. So I handed her cash, got my change and then she tried to hand me two large drinks at the same time. I'm sorry but I can't grab two large drinks and the straws at the same time. But I did because she just stuck them out the window. A couple of minutes later, the manager hands me my bag of burgers and fries and says sorry about the wait.  WTF I will never go to this burger king ever again"}
{"text":"not much to say.location is great now make this business thrive! get an upgraded drink machine and signs. the drive through was so slow some disgusting  customer  pissed in a bottle while waiting (see pics)"}
{"text":"Old shriveled fries !!! Bought unsweetened ice tea, gave me sweetened !!! Not good for a newly opened location."}
{"text":"Okay. My first trip here in a while was breakfast time. They asked me to pull in front to wait on my hash browns. 6 minutes later I had my food. Usually when fast good places make you wait too long, they give you bigger fries. But not this place. My second trip there (the next day) I had to wait 10 minutes for my food which was also at breakfast time. Despite how delicious their breakfast menu is, I won't be back here for a while."}
{"text":"Kudos to this location for pulling of a great fundraising event for my sons elementary school. I only attended this location because my son's school used them for a fundraiser. 10% of the sales were being donated to an elementary school. I opted to park and dine in because it has an indoor play ground. The parking lot is pretty small. They share a lot with a plaza which has at least 2-3 more stores. The drive through access is a little awkward, but what fast food place isn't now-a-days.   Anyway, upon entering I initially thought long line, long wait. Well, they had workers stationed all throughout the restaurant to offer assistance which was very helpful. I was able to find a table for my family and the manager made sure to bring my food which is not usual for a fast food place. I was impressed. There was not much moving space in the dining area. I am not sure if they added more tables because of the event or not. There was staff always visible cleaning and assisting the guests which was great. The food quality was good. They got my order correct and it was still hot when I was eating it."}
{"text":"Our family used to love this Burger King, now after an apparent manager change, the only reason we go is because it's the closest. Every Time we go through the drive thru it's seems as though they just want us to hurry up and leave. There's no greeting, just shove the bags into our hands and close the window. Food is fine, service is awful."}
{"text":"THE WORST customer service I have ever had. Ive never been talked to and disrespected at any place like this burger king location. I go to this burger king because its the closet to me. EVERY single time I go through the drive thru there is someone with an attitude. I kid you not! They must have a high turn over for employees because theres always new people. Im sure they hire anyone because they need the help but my god, there needs to be some reprecussion for the way employees talk to the customers. They need a slap in the face, literally. I know they hear it too because they have those ear pieces in. One time it was this chic named 'POOH'. Who I heard say through the speaker as Im ordering \"damn, she ordering the whole menu\"! I was ordering for 4 people stupid woman! This past time I asked for extra cheese on my burger and the dude acted like I didnt ask. Twice I asked and he snapped at me \"Anything else!\" Still didnt get the extra cheese. I'm not arguing over a slice of cheese so I let it go. These are only 2 occasions. Theres been many more. Just examples of the poor customer service Ive experienced. Not to mention the food is mediocre warm. Ive stopped going there and take my business somewhere else. Stay away from this location if you can help it!"}
{"text":"This Burger King is on my way home from work, so most of the time I just give in and stop there hoping for the best.  I am always disappointed.  9 times out of 10 my order is wrong on top of waiting insanely long amounts of time at the drive thru.  I feel like this Burger King is one of Gods Cruel jokes."}
{"text":"Took the kids here for lunch while we were on our way to the Touch A Truck event a few months ago.  It's your standard franchise restaurant which seemed to be running smoothly, despite being opened recently.  One note is that the person at the counter taking the orders struggled to take the order, but that is to be expected with a newly opened store."}
{"text":"It's a Burger King.  Standard Formula, standard food.  One thing that bugs me about this location is that they ALWAYS ask me to pull forward (not to the parking lot) but just forward to get my food.  I think it's because they don't want their drive through times to go through the roof.  That being said, the food production here is slower than others I've visited and the employees at times are hit and miss.  Teenagers that give no smile, don't even say a word to you (just put your hand out for payment) and in general don't give you the satisfaction of good service while spending your money.  The food is fine, the employees here need to work on their happy faces."}
{"text":"NOTE: When I give Burger King four stars it is because I am comparing it to other fast food establishments. I want everyone to understand that it is not a rating of the food/experience as compared to all other dining establishments.  This Burger King has a lovely ambience. The exterior of the building is light grey brick, with the design suggesting a more upscale establishment. The pretty landscaping adds to this impression. The tables and floors are spick-and-span and there is a vase of Gerber daisies carefully placed on each table, giving the restaurant a friendly and festive vibe.  Burger King has several good breakfast options. The croissanwich can be bacon, ham or sausage. There are pancakes (3 for 89 cents!) and pancake platters. French toast sticks are a personal guilty pleasure. They also serve a breakfast burrito, biscuit sandwiches, and off course hashbrowns (which closely resemble tater tots).  For fast food breakfast, Burger King is definitely under appreciated. It's cheap and yummy, and fast, hence the name \"fast\" food. My biggest complaint, and its a big one, is that BK does not offer espresso drinks. It is just straight up coffee, hot or iced. And this girl NEEDS her latte in the morning!!"}
{"text":"The food is stale here...enough said don't come to this location.. Wasted my money on this place two stars cause the place is clean and has free wifi"}
{"text":"I order onion rings with my food. There was a hair on the, a long hair about 4-5 inches. It was no big, I went to the counter to have them switched out, I showed them to the cashier who obviously didn't take notice. She grabbed the tray with the onion rings on them and common sence; the hair will fly off while your move the try across the front counter area. When I told the manager Lucia , I wasn't rude at all, I just wanted the onion rings repced because Cleary saw the hair. She said in Spanish no one here has long hair. I'm bilingual, she didn't know that. The ladies there have long hair. She was rude and defensive so I gave up and just said I'd like my money back. She of course kept her attitude the whole time. Burger king needs to retrain this manager Lucia to have customer service skills not just pushing paper and flipping burgers."}
{"text":"That ole time Burger King smell brought back memories of when I used to eat in the fast food chain.  It's been a very long time.  Thought I'd try the $1.29 special and perused the menu while there was 1 customer in front of me and 1 waiting inside the restaurant.  There were not many people inside eating as well.  I ordered a Whopper Jr without mayo and pickles to go.  On my way out, I prepared my sandwich to eat, took one bite and found 1 flat hamburger, onions (not strips) 3/4 wide and ketchup.  What, no tomato at least?  Believe me, it's not that hard, trust me, to take orders and make a simple ole whopper jr.   I practically threw away the sandwich...it was only $1.29.  I might add, the entrance floor inside was grimey and noticed it upon leaving.  Will not return."}
{"text":"It's ok, it's fast food a little better than Mc Donald's, but they have wifi, that is a plus."}
{"text":"This is called no mayo.  Looks like the licked it off.  And took the toppings.  Last call for \"not so king\"."}
{"text":"TLDR; this place suck and smells bad. Wouldn't even sit in the booths and the floors are sticky.  I've been to this location twice. The first time no one said anything to us for 5 minutes so we left. Fast forward 6 months and we're back, hoping for a difference. This time it only took a minute for acknowledgment of existence but as soon as the guy walked up to the register he turned around and walked to the back. Then, who I'm assuming is, the manager walked up to take our order. After waiting for about 15 minutes for our food we walked up to see what was taking so long. Mind you there were 2 other kids in the restaurant besides us. The manager asked where our burgers were and the dude in the back said \"oh, I didn't know I had to make those.\" There was one guy in the back that was actually working at a normal persons speed; doing the dishes then helped with our food when he saw what was happening.  This place sucks but kudos to that guy."}
{"text":"I thought this burger king had closed down. Last time I went it looked like it had closed"}
{"text":"Customer service here is terrible they're very rude!! I will be calling corporate I think the outcome of tonight's shows that the employees have no respect for their consumers who are actually making the business stay open I'm a customer service representative in the way that we were treated tonight is absolutely not acceptable"}
{"text":"Updating my review.  The service and food quality seem to have improved greatly since I wrote my initial review.  The fries and onion rings are fried better than most other fast food places...not soggy and not greasy.  The people working here now seem a lot friendlier than when they first opened.  This location is right by the M Casino."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went there this morning, only customer in the restaurant, one vehicle at drive thru. Waited 5 minutes at counter to wait on me, was acknowledged twice as being there but no one ever took my order."}
{"text":"The worst service and staff on the planet.    The manager was an idiot, just yelling at the clueless staff who all seemed like this was their first day on the job.  The restaurant was filthy inside  and the poor people on the drive thru line were in for an hour wait or longer.      Will never ever return to this location.  Terrible ,terrible"}
{"text":"The food is what you would expect from a fast food establishment, however.. There were more flies in the lobby than people.. Take the food to go.."}
{"text":"Staff is always nice but they can never get an order right. Asked for a whopper with cheese, no mayo, extra pickles and onions.  They had it correct on the screen.  What I got was a whopper with cheese, no pickles or onions, and about half a cup of mayo. Threw it away."}
{"text":"We called this location to see if they were open. Their website stated that they were open until 12 am but at 11:13, they yelled \"we're f**king closed\" and when we tried to go in, they turned their backs to us. Their customer service was awful and rude. DO NOT RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"Can I give zero stars? Every. Single. Time. We go here (whether it's drive thru or walk in) ...they get my order wrong. I hate mustard and I hate pickles. Guess what? My burger is slopped with both things each time. The service is typically rude, like I'm bothering them. There is one tall, thin brunette guy (looks 17-19) that is always very nice. But that's about it."}
{"text":"3 stars for having the ketchup pump instead of the tiny packets"}
{"text":"I should not expect too much from a airport restaurant.  That being said we got to the airport straight from the hotel so we all wanted something to eat and drink.  Walked up to the counter and telling the lady several times how I wanted my burger and she did repeat it back to me wrong every time.  Nearly had a attack when I got the total due, which was several dollars higher than most of the local places.  Sitting down and opening the burger it was wrong, surprise.  Head back to the counter and try to explain to the cook that it was wrong, in which she promptly got mad at me for questioning her burger making skills.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Summary: Excellent service and surprisingly good food.  Craving some fast food one evening before a Walmart trip, I stopped by this Burger King at around 10 pm. I wasn't confident about the hours found on Google Places, which listed a closing time of 11 pm, but I assumed that the drive-thru would at least still be open. (Burger King's website, unfortunately, doesn't list hours for its restaurants, so customers need to either call or guess.)  I first pulled into the drive-thru and rolled down my window. After a few seconds of looking at the menu board, I decided to back out. Since I had an old receipt with a survey code, I decided I'd rather first check to see if the dining room were open to make it easier to place an order with the survey receipt. The promotion allowed for either a free Whopper or a free Original Chicken sandwich with the purchase of any size drink and fries.  When I pulled out of the drive-thru lane and into the parking area, the front door of the restaurant swung open, where the manager and one of his employees stood looking out at me. I parked in a space and as my window was down already, I asked them if the restaurant was still open. The manager said with a smile that the drive-thru was open till midnight. He seemed relieved that I had asked, since he and the employee had probably watched me on video backing away from the drive-thru and were understandably suspicious of my awkward back-up job.  I told them thank you and pulled into the drive-thru, ordering a Whopper, an Original Chicken Sandwich, a medium drink, and a large fries, which came out to be $9.52. Once I pulled up to the second window, a friendly employee handed me my drink. I then gave him my receipt with the survey discount code. He plugged in some numbers in the POS screen but had to ask the manager for help, since he had probably already put in my original order. The manager gave me back my receipt and told me that he had given me the 2 for $5 Whopper and Chicken Sandwich deal, explaining that it would come out to be cheaper than if I had used the survey code to get an extra sandwich.  I hesitated, reconfirming the price of $9.52. The manager noticed my trepidation and asked me how much had I been looking to spend, telling me that he could adjust my order according to my budget. I told him around $7.00. I asked him to maybe take off the Whopper. He said it might work out to keep both sandwiches with a medium fries instead of a large. He did some plugging around on the POS screen, while I added that I could downgrade to a small fries if I needed to.  He ended up getting my order down to a value fries and a small drink, without having to take away any of the sandwiches, for $7.15, asking if that were okay with me. I responded that they had already given me a medium drink, and he said, \"Don't worry about it. It's on us.\" He then confirmed that I had been given a straw.  The employee took my credit card, and about 10 seconds after giving it back to me, handed me my bag of food, told me there was ketchup in the bag, thanked me with a smile, and wished me a good evening.  After opening my bag in the Walmart parking lot, I discovered that along with my two sandwiches there was a large fries inside. (Recall that they had cut my order down to a value size.) That was certainly a bonus, having only paid for the value size. The fries were a bit on the salty side but definitely tasted better than the limited-edition crinkle-cut Satisfries that I had at another Burger King location.  On opening my Whopper box, I discovered that my sandwich was surprisingly well-made, presented very neatly in one of those origami-looking half-wrappers and as thick and tidy-looking as a Whopper would look in a promotional photo). My first bite was excellent, as I could immediately taste the onion and the charbroiled taste of the beef. From start to finish, this Whopper didn't disappoint, and while eating it I was reminded of why I've always found the Whopper to be better-tasting and of better value than its counterparts at McDonald's and Wendy's.  My Original Chicken Sandwich was the same as it's always been since my childhood. Since it's presented in a full wrapper rather than a box and doesn't have as many toppings (only shredded iceberg lettuce and mayonnaise), it didn't have the chance to shine like the Whopper in its presentation, but it still tasted just as I would expect it to--satisfying.  Overall, I was extremely pleased with my visit to this Burger King. Most people don't expect great service and food from a fast food restaurant, but sometimes there are surprises out there. This Burger King location is one of those surprises, and I'll definitely be back when I'm out that way on Route 30 and craving some BK."}
{"text":"I've had breakfast at a lot of Burger King stores and this one in rantoul has the worst biscuits of them all. I don't if they're just shit biscuits or if it's because the dipshit millennials who just don't give a shit. Maybe they're too busy holding their phone to their faces to pay attention to their job."}
{"text":"This place.. When to eat .. And i ask to use the restroom.. They ask me if i bought anything.. Asshole... I know ur in the ghetto area. Does not mean all are ghetto that eat there.. Chubby white hair latina  u know who u are.. Ohh before i ask to use the restroom. She rolled her eyes and said wait.. Lol.... That why u work there.. No where else will hire u"}
{"text":"This is the worst Burger King in Arizona thanks to Maria the night shift drive-through operator. Has the nerve to tell me I cannot have my burger the way I want it that's what Burger King is all about have it your way never again will I spend my money with this place. I am very disappointed in this franchise"}
{"text":"I have visited this location multiple times, and there is always something wrong with my order!!! ALWAYS!! Also, don't try to substitute onion rings for fries, forget about it!! You will get fries rather you like them or not!!"}
{"text":"Quickly placed an order and received just what we ordered in record time.  Very friendly cashier too."}
{"text":"I totally agree with the other comments as far as at the speaker they do not seem to be listening. When he repeated my order he left out that I wanted cheese on my burger and when I asked if he got it with cheese I got no reply, I have worked fast food and so I know he was able to hear me ask. However when I got to the window the order was correct. He seemed rushed and like he had way too much to do, I did not really enjoy the salt with fried potatoe or what they referd to as \"french fries\" WAYYY too much salt I could not even eat them, my burger was not hot either, it was warm though. I do not expect much from fast food places however you have to try to not be good and this was by far my worst Burger King experiance. I may try them again maybe it was just a bad night but seeing the other reviews maybe this is the best this establishment is going to do. I am giving  1 star only because my order was actually correct and you cant give any less than one star lol."}
{"text":"Little rant !  Can't believe it, one of the things that we were really looking for was to taste one of those Halloween Whoppers, When we arrived and went through the drive thru the lady reply in a rude tone \"Sorry but that was a limited time only\" OMG ! It's  not even Halloween yet! That sucks!"}
{"text":"Good locations. They have a cool play area for kids. Place is pretty clean looks like a well operated Burger King. Good Job!"}
{"text":"Terrible service Waited 15 minutes in-store becuase of the four drive thru orders that was already ordered wrecking chaos over the crew...and then the food me and other in party ordered was cold? Girl at the counter asks us if we gotten our food yet before giving it to us?(you mean to tell me you don't know?!?!?)"}
{"text":"My God. I don't know how you can screw up BURGER KING but this joint \"does it there way\". 3 times now I've gone here and they've been out of stock on the items I've wanted. How is that allowed?!?!  F' this joint!!"}
{"text":"Worst burger king ever! First when I tried to order my combo meal the cashier laughed at me and said she didnt want to take my order. Then after finally taking my order I had to wait around half an hour for my food. Their were a couple other people waiting too while the employees gossiped and joked amongst themselves. Eventually I got my chicken nugget combo meal which was very dry. It seemed like the chicken sat out for hours plus they refused to give me my drink because they thought I already got it. Do not go to this place unless you want a terrible fast food experience!"}
{"text":"The binch working the night shift tonight closed the register 30 minutes early and told me she was done taking orders. They close at 12! AGH"}
{"text":"$13 for a Whopper combo.. It's Vegas, it's the airport, it's expected. The hilarious thing here is BK prides itself on flame broiled burgers.. I took one bite and it tasted different than usual. Then it dawned on me.. You can't have an open flame grill in an airport.  Go if you're desperate."}
{"text":"BK isn't on the top of my list for fast food... but once in a while I want a bacon, egg, and cheese croissanwich. This place is okay, even though one time I got an icee that was kind of yucky so I had to throw it away - I don't even want to know what happened to it. I'll still come back for my croissanwich though."}
{"text":"I eat at Burger Kings across the valley a lot. Because if my work schedule I like to order lunch during typical breakfast hours. Every BK ive been to in Las Vegas serves burgers during breakfast. Not this one.  I'll hit up CJ  burgers for now on. They seem to understand it's a 24 hour town and sometimes people want burgers for breakfast. Oh yeah, Jack in the box also offers burgers. No wonder this place has a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Looooooooove burger King, BUT.... The only thing that sucks is that they make there burgers so messy like they don't care who it is, on the bright side there very fast at making yummy food, me & my family come here alot because we all love the food so much lol. The manager is a very nice young lady and is very respectful, she's not rude at all, and also my son loves eating the fries here that's another reason why we come alot, but I would deffinently recommend to anyone if there looking for a fast bite to eat to deffinently fly this way down here, good quality, and very tasteful food."}
{"text":"I went to this location 2 nights in a row 40 minutes before closing to get a quick bite and they would not give me services because for whatever reason.  Not happy about that.  They close at midnight but stopped acknowledging customers in the drive thru."}
{"text":"If you guys can even put the \"spicy sauce\" on a spicy chicken jr. why would you expect $15 a hour.  Even asked twice to make sure to add sauce. Too hard handle though."}
{"text":"Disgusting! I had to order my Whopper twice as the bun was burnt completely black! Why would anyone serve that? The chicken fries I order I threw them in the trash because we're so old and I could not eat. I just left...do not eat here."}
{"text":"This BK has only been open for a couple of weeks. BRAND NEW - how? HOW? Can the service and food be this bad ALREADY?  The first time we stopped by the week they opened, the food was...meh, at best. Burger was smashed and not even warm, much less hot.   I decided to stop by again yesterday on my way home from the airport. I went inside to place my order. My order was taken at 5:59pm.. 1 Original chicken sandwich combo, that's it - no extras, nothing special, no \"hold the onions, extra ketchup\" nonsense. I had just gotten off a flight and fought traffic from the airport, I wanted quick and easy and home.  At 6:29 ( yes, you read that right) I finally asked for a refund, this is a burger joint, not Ruth's Christs.. Never - and I mean NEVER should it take a Burger King over 30 minutes to make and package 1 standard combo meal..the manager asked no questions, apologized, and refunded my money..I counted at least 12 people behind the counter last night working for over 30 minutes to try and get a combo chicken meal in a bag..  Well, my husband thought he'd give it a try tonight (not knowing what I'd gone through the night before). He went through the drive thru , and was home in a reasonable amount of time - with COLD (not warm) fries, COLD (not warm, and DEFINITELY NOT HOT) burger, and FLAT coke.  What the HE*£, Burger King?  Tonight? Last straw!   This place sucks!  I tried to call the store to find out what is up with this new store.. And got an answering machine telling me that they are all busy serving customers. Really?   Staff have just been trained, quality control should be utmost importance, manager should be on her toes making sure this grand opening knocks it out of the park! Complete failure on ALL counts! Don't take my money and hand me sh*+ in return! thinking I'll not take the time to notice, nothing pisses me off more than restaurants who do things halfway thinking they will get away with it.  Stay far away from this new Burger King. I gave them three chances, and way to much money for the crap they are serving!"}
{"text":"Went to the BK lounge to try try the heralded Yumbo sandwich with ham & cheese.  Quite disappointing in overall flavor and contents.  The advertisements def depict the ham piled higher than my 2 slices thick. Also, they messed up/forgot my order but did attempt to make good with free stuff after a 15+ minute wait.. Interior is newer but just not enough to bring me back anytime soon....if ever."}
{"text":"I realize it's completely pointless to review an airport Burger King, but seriously this was the worst cheeseburger I've had at a BK. I know that customer traffic is spotty so they keep a bunch of burgers in the warmer, but throwing a warmed over hamburger onto a cold bun, plus a slice of cold cheese, plus cold condiments does not make a cheeseburger. And adding french fries that have clearly been sitting around for ages does not sweeten the deal. I will gladly wait for a fresh meal without complaining. Bad Burger King."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed in this place. If cancer was a place this would be it. I ordered and was told to move up to a parking spot and wait for my order to be brought out to me. I waited for honestly 15 minutes (keep in mind I decided to go here before work so I was on a time schedule) I decide to go in and ask about my order.. And to find out no one had any knowledge of my order. It was a simple fry sandwich and drink. I would rate this lower but Yelp requires you too at least rate one star. I received my order and it was made extremely poor and no one apologized; not even the manager who handed me my food for my wait outside. If I hadn't come in I would not have received my order. I'm sad to say this is a place I will warn my peers about."}
{"text":"Grabbed a sausage croissant breakfast meal for a nearby event going on... This BK is undergoing a major dining room renovation... But the drive thru is still open. The lady who took my order and handed me my food was very nice, considering the time of hour :)  I normally don't drink coffee but I did this morning and it was surprisingly good Decaf with cream and sugar  It was yummy"}
{"text":"This place sucks customer service sucks all of it sucks. Sucks! And it's slow! Obviously math skills are not a requirement for a position here....."}
{"text":"If you like the smell of weed and burgers then go here and the drive thru window was trash the lady that took my order was great the lady that gave me my food wreaked of marijuana and she was rude no hello How are you welcome to BK nothing terrible customer service and the meal was wrong no tomatoes is pretty straight forward both burgers had tomatoes never coming back here again  2 stars because the woman who took my order was professional and courteous"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. Trip 1: cold food. Trip 2: cold food. Trip 3: wrong food.  Seriously this is by far the worst fast food place on Earth. Is it really a coincidence that it is across the street from the worst Wal-mart on Earth?"}
{"text":"Filthy. And I know it's a Burger King... But filth is filth. The food isn't any better. There are many other interesting options in that neighborhood, you should avoid this place. Especially if you're tourist!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about, but worth a shout out on yelp. I went through the drive-thru during the height of lunch hour and was impressed with the expeditious service. The food was on-par with other BK's I've visited. I will return, as this location is conveniently located for a quick jaunt from work. The fries weren't as hot and fresh as I would have liked, but good enough to eat every last one of them."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh:(  This morning I didn't get a breakfast so stopped at this BK for breakfast sandwich and coffee.  I told her no cheese on my sandwich.  She asked me again to confirm no cheese which I said \"yes, no cheese please\".  She said \"okay no cheese\".  No cheese was said by her twice and by me twice.  So guess what I got??? Huge cheese all over my sandwich.  I love cheese but this morning I didn't want any.  So I had to take off the top and the ham which was drowning in cheese.  Had half of a sandwich with just egg and bottom biscuit.  Today my morning started off sucky!  Thanks BK in 2024 E Southern Ave, Mesa.  Last time going to this location.  I can't imagine how horrible they would be if they were busy.  This morning at 9:50am the place was semi empty."}
{"text":"They serve burned bun and saggy fries. Even the onion rings are not fresh. Their fish filet sandwich taste nasty and it smells burned. So disappointed with the quality and cleanliness. Staff strongly needs a lot of training."}
{"text":"Just watched a lady spill half my fries on the ground and put them in the bag. I paid 6.00 for 2 DBL cheese and a medium fries. No thank you or have a nice day. Employees were very rude"}
{"text":"I had the standard 'two can dine for $9.48' coupons (oh how I would gladly pay the extra penny just to have it rhyme again!) so I headed off to the Sheppard Centre with a coworker for lunch!  This location is definitely one of the busier places in the food court but they really know how to manage crowd control and hustled us through surprisingly fast.  Now, I like my Whopper as much as the next guy but yesterday I thought I would be adventurous and try their chicken sandwich. I think I was hoping that it would be reminiscent of the ever-delicious KFC chicken sandwich but sadly, this was not the case.  The chicken was breaded and deep fried like KFC's but for whatever reason, this chicken came out greasy and heavy tasting. It wasn't enjoyable at all and I was left feeling gross and wishing I had stuck with the Whopper.  Why have I been having such horrible experiences at Burger Kings lately? Maybe I should pay attention to that."}
{"text":"The wonderful thing about places like Burger King is, you always know what you're going to get... or do you?  This has got to be the first time I've sat in a Burger King and thought... what the ....?  Why am I tasting salt in my Whopper Jr.? (I know, again with the salt thing, right?) But seriously, I didn't expect my burger to be coated in it. I've never experienced that before, granted, I've never ordered a Whopper Jr. before either, but that shouldn't make a difference!  This was the strangest experience I've ever had at a Burger King. The booth we sat at appeared to be clean enough but once we sat down, I noticed that the back rest was so dirty, it was actually sticky... okay, so I just won't lean back... then, when I opened the wrapping for my burger, it was like a Jack in the Box and I was left with a deconstructed burger sprawled out in front of me. Oh for F* sake, I'm in a hurry - I don't have time for this!  I slapped it together, scarfed it down and we were on our way... feeling dirty and unsatisfied.  *sigh* I should have gone for a Happy Meal."}
{"text":"This is one of my breakfast stops. Rosie and her crew are great. Always get great customer service with a smile. The restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"This is the worst service in the world. This place is for people that enjoy dingleberries. Everyone that works here should die, all you do is mess up orders. I ordered a bbq bacon whopper and you give me a \"rodeo burger\" ?! I didnt know deaf people are allowed to work there. If you wanted sign language i wouldve told Stone Cold Steve Austin to give you some. I hope a disturbed child craps in your deepfryer therefore giving you the slightest edge because your food is complete garbage. I am going to eat this trash burger you call \"food\" because you guys are bunch of wastemans that can get boxed."}
{"text":"NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER AGAIN~~~~~~  It has to be the WORST BK EVER!!!! Why do I do this to myself? I RARELY eat FF so it comes as no shock that I was radically disappointed with this visit, and yet I still went. I tried to go through the drive through and of course time stood still as the line was NOT MOVING AT ALL!!!! Other cars started to peel off and leave the drive through and I moved up to what was the hold up...Some dude was passed out in his car at the menu board...SERIOUSLY!!! half hanging out his window with the door slightly ajar.... Never again I tell you... Never again..."}
{"text":"Ordered a Whopper. The meat had no beef taste and the texture was like mush. Whoppers used to be the best fast food burgers but, and this is a problem with all Burger King locations, it has quickly gone downhill. With the competition between fast food restaurants this makes no sense. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"What a piece of shit Burger King. I went through the drive thru and ordered a chicken sandwich with extra lettuce. Do you think I got that? No I got an old ass chicken patty slapped between a brunt ass bun, no lettuce, and no mayo.  Everyone just had a big old scall on their face. She basically just threw the bag through the window and didn't say anything. I didn't check my sandwich till I was already home, then when I called 2 times one answered. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Burger King in a while. Now I know why. I can understand if they can't add stacker sauce because they no longer have that sandwich, that's fine. There used to be a time that I could get more than a few sauces for my chicken frys. Now I know if I want like 10 sauces I would expect a charge, but if I only want an extra 2 or 3 sauces you are gonna charge me 15 cents each?!? . I ain't lookin to get rung up for 45 cents just for a few sauces. I like their sauce but that price is too damn high."}
{"text":"Sucks sucks sucks here  Rude manager slammed the drive thru window in my face as I was talking!!! She was trying to act like I didn't know what I ordered  I'm in the wrong business ... if I had known I could get paid for being a self righteous asshole ... HEY bk are you hiring????"}
{"text":"Clean and comfortable; however, some of the worst BK food I have received in a long while. Chicken nugget breading  was still raw on some parts. Pretty gross. Next time choosing another location.  The Internet was also very unpredictable here"}
{"text":"This Burger King is the worst fast food place I have ever eaten at. After several mix ups and the Manager being so rude each time. She always makes you feel like it is your fault. She's really unbelievable. I haven't been there for months. I decided to go thru the drive thru tonight. Well, big mistake!! Got my order wrong, shorted me food I paid for. And when I called, once again this manager was extremely rude. I wish I had recorded the conversation. I would have blasted it on social media. I will NEVER EVER go back!!"}
{"text":"3 times in a couple of weeks I work late they claim to be open till a certain time and I get their a good 30 min before closing time and they say they are closed what a joke."}
{"text":"My daughter in law and granddaughter received the worst service today and from the manager in charge \"Mike\" no less. He argued with my daughter in law over French fries instead of just making it right. He also chose to diminish my 4 year old granddaughters experience also just to try and prove his position as the ultimate decision maker \"manager in charge\". She ordered a meal for her and her daughter and was missing the fries that come with the meal. When asked to produce the fries he went on a tirade instead of just simply replacing them. Burger King needs to reposition this person to a non customer facing position or simply eliminate someone who turns off your paying customer with a large family and friends that will no longer visit this location. Peoria and 91st ave bad service and even worse leadership. Disappointed in Peoria."}
{"text":"In between flights I was looking for something quick and cheap, well BurgerKing fit the bill. The line is kinda weird and starts to the left side looking at the menu. So there were people who realized this then others who just walked straight up to the cashregister unaware of those inline. Ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. Custom ordered with extra lettuce and pickles. Came out quick and correct. Wouldn't say the sandwich was mindblowing just ok for $4."}
{"text":"I don't know why I bother. After a log day at the park and really no urge to cook I figured why not and have some fast food. Being vegetarian really the only place to go is Burger King. When ordering my childrens meals I specifically asked for no pickles and no mustard and not to any surprise when we got home of course there was pickles and mustard. For my vegetarian sandwich I asked for mayo (which they charged me .75 for) and yup that wasn't on there either. The person taking our order must have been doing something else brig the fact that I had to repeat myself 6 times and then drive thru girl well let's just say her attitude wasn't any better. No smile, no hello, and no here's your food. Needles to say I've been staying away from fast food for a reason and Burger King you pretty much proved my point."}
{"text":"I wish it were possible to give them less than one star.....worst burger I've ever had in my life...save your money and your life...do not eat here.  Eat at Panda Express right next to it.  I should have known when all the airport employees were in The Panda Express line, that BK sucked.....but I was hungry and after waiting 4 hours for a delayed flight I had no patience to wait for dinner......"}
{"text":"Messed up my order again! Never going to this location again.  And it's workers like this that want to be paid more than minimum wage? Gimme a break.  You can't even get a burger order right!"}
{"text":"Waited and waited for someone to take my order and I was ignored as if I was invisible....when I finally asked, Is anyone taking orders? I got a rude response.... the only reason I didn't ask for my money back was because I was in a rush and hungry. obviously these people hate their job. sad!"}
{"text":"This is a great Burger King with a really nice fresh remodel. Extremely friendly servers always. Food is always good hot and consistent!"}
{"text":"3.5 ez stars  They have a meal that is over 11 bucks...lol  We had a nice quick simple dinner here. The staff was underdressed and a little unattentive but i do not go here for wait service.   We had 9 of us and 5 were kids. They made the food to perfection and nothing was old, cold, or bad.   I was impressed."}
{"text":"Rude mouthy manager taking orders and refusing to give food useless I give him a tip and can't get a simple order current.... 1st,  off this dude should a manager if he can't even have proper customers service. 2nd, sense when does Burger King ask there customers for tips let alone with hold a customer food after already paying for and demanding a tip not only once but twice cause I was only given half my food. Seriously this dude needs to be fired..."}
{"text":"My son wanted his Burger King so we stopped by this location. We were greeted with a sign on the door that the all soda machines are all out of order. They had other beverages to offer but a little disappointing that the portions of the substitutions were very small. In the long run a healthier choice...I guess. Place was dead yet I counted 7 tables that needed a good wipe down."}
{"text":"I just don't understand why ever time I order they tell me to pull up front to give me my order! Even if there's no one behind me! If I wanted to park in the parking lot I would have walked in!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. A kid at the counter put a used cup back into the ice machine and did not dump out all the ice and refill it. Also, my daughter got an ice cream cone and there was a hair in it. Overall just not impressed."}
{"text":"This Burger King is very new and clean. They have the same digital signboards for the menus as the other Burger Kings I have been to.  They have a barbecue sauce dispenser, which was different. I like barbecue sauce.  Since there was almost no one else in the store the food came out rather quickly and it tasted good.  The restrooms were nice."}
{"text":"Unique menu! Authentic 1950s feel in the sense that you get a burger with a side of cigarette smoke. Convenient opening times. Staff is alright. My favorite burger maker is Alexis. She is the only one I trust to make my burgers. Pro tip: Mac n cheetos will make you regret life itself."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. Left out fries and salad dressing from drive thru order. Was made to come back to restaurant. In order to have meal credited which was getting cold in my hotel room they would not replace the food. Amazing and manager insisted on calling me sweetheart after I insisted she stop.  Worst customer service I have ever had!!! Can't wait to fill out BK survey."}
{"text":"Wow the manager is worthless and when I complained about hair in my food (legit, I have $1500 in my pocket right now) they treated me like I was lying. Since they had at this time just stopped serving breakfast, I opted for a burger instead. They then tried to charge me the difference, and then hand me a burger with uncooked bacon and so cold the cheese didn't melt one bit!!! I brought the burger back, didn't ask for a penny back, left.... I refuse to ever visit this burger king again, and if this is a representation of the value the corporation has in its customers, I will definitely be advising my stock broker to sell my shares!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Are homeless people really sitting in here sleeping all day? What the fuck is this shit."}
{"text":"Service here was just terrible. I ordered 3 whoppers. 1 as a combo and the cashier made a mistake of punching in as 3 combos. He then rolled his eyes and talked to his manager. Not once have I felt so offended just to order at bk. He then felt the need to lecture me about the proper way of ordering my food. Don't get mad at the customers just because you punched the bill wrong."}
{"text":"Don't do it to yourself.   Burger Kings are generally bad but this location actually fails to meet the low standard one would hold this type of place to. I'm struggling to determine what is worse, the food or the service.   There are a lot of food options at CLT, if you need something fast grab a smoothie at Starbucks, you'll be glad you avoided this place and so will the passengers seated near the bathrooms on your flight."}
{"text":"Love this place. Chicken nuggets 1.99 and great onion rings, employees are very nice and polite."}
{"text":"Seems everything i go in there its dirty! food everywhere trash overflowing, some of the younger people are rude and when he went to clean the lobby he stop and said i ain't doing this , in front of a couple of people told the girl that she needed to do it. Took forever to order cause he wanted to stand and talk with the people in front waiting for their food.  The bathrooms are weird, only one seat in there?! Also the door was hard to lock, idk who though about this idea but it was horrible!  The food was OK it could of been better it was sloppy and only had a very small tomato on the whopper. If i didn't work close to this one and other people didn't want it i wouldn't be going back there!  They had the game on when we went and it was SO LOUD so the people in back could hear the game it was just horrible!"}
{"text":"This place should be slated to close ASAP ! !  The Assist. Mgr. waited on me and was very friendly. I had the pulled pork sandwich, which was very good. My problem is that for someone meeting the public, it looked as if her white blouse/uniform had been put on a little over six months ago and never removed and never washed. I've seen grease mechanics clothing cleaner after a long day of changing oil on cars. The beverage machines several of the buttons were missing, and the labels were all grimy and several were missing leaving you to guess what they would dispense. I opted for the fruit punch and was given plain water. Again the sandwich was excellent and I like the standard type of French fry over shoe-strings. As for cleanliness... not on your life!!"}
{"text":"If you come here during lunch, plan to spend at least 30 minutes waiting in line to order  Update:  Had another situation...I gave them another chance, ordered a whopper...cut it in half, it was pink inside....took it to the counter, the rep, brought out a new one and had me cut it...it too was pink....I switched to a whopper jr, finally no pink...she apologized, was empathetic and her manager never charged my card for our dinner, as I left I thanked her for the excellent service we received.  What could have been another negative experience moved my rating from a one star to a three based on service...well done."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick bite before work.  Burger meal was $8.63 and sandwich was as small as I've ever seen. Rip off. ZERO STARS."}
{"text":"Terrible... Made the mistake of driving through here to grab a convenient lunch for my kids & I.  When we got home to eat,  all of our meals were incorrect,  mine even came with the wrong kind of meat. Tried calling the phone number listed on the receipt three different times with no success.  Frustrating experience."}
{"text":"Drive-Thru service at this BK is totally unacceptable. My last 2 visits in the drive thru after paying for the food I was advised to go park at the front door to get my food (observed this same behavior with other vehicles as well).  The first visit was a single item and the 2nd visit was a 2 items (nothing special needed to be done).  Unless there is a trend I'm not aware of isn't it logical to wait for your non-special request food at the drive thru window?? If not BK Corp needs to visit this location stat!"}
{"text":"Travis wasn't very friendly to me behind the register. My food arrived fresh, and warm which was really nice though. The bathrooms were dirty but the inside was mostly clean. Right now BK has a couple of very good deals on their food so give them a try but don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"Wish i could give 0 stars!  Waited 42 minutes in the drive thru. There were only 6 cars ahead of me!  Completely rude when I got to the window. No apology no explanation!  Then opened up my sandwich and it was ice cold. Went in and got laughed at by a young girl who was on her cell phone at the counter."}
{"text":"6 cheeseburgers, 3 sodas, 3 small fries.  Service: We pull up and young lady says, \"uhmmm, it's gonna be a while..... can you pull forward? \" She sounded very confused and interuppted from a previous conversation to help the drive through, but she was nice enough. We pulled forward to wait and it was brought out by a girl, Yanna, who seemed tired and put out of her way to deliver the bag with nothing to say except, \"Here.\"  We smiled and said thank you and she replied,  \"sure\" pretty blandly.. I do not think they were trying to be rude but they did not seem to handle their jobs with much maturity or care.  Food: The Sprite soda tasted like chlorine and was undrinkable even by my 2 year old standards (which is hard to do)  Each burger was immedietly opened, but not warm.  Definately tasted pretty gross to me.  The cheese was not melted on a single one.  Fries were good and hot at least.  Cheap meal but over the top poor quality or presentation.  It looks like a district manager should spend some time with this store to help get the standards retrained as well or they ought to rethink who they schedule together.   Sad face."}
{"text":"I would typically not post review for fast food but staff member at this establishment deserves praise. I believe his name is Devonte and that man deserves a promotion. I walked in and he was super friendly, helpful, and full of energy. That young man has a bright future somewhere."}
{"text":"This place so nasty and dirty. We walked in to have lunch and we had to walk out. It smells like bathroom, went to the bathroom even more disgusting. I wonder in what conditions they prepare their food. Do not even bother to eat in here. Go some place else."}
{"text":"I've passed by this location many a times and finally decided to check it out. Wow! Very impressed with the look of this branch: lots of seating, bright beautiful decor, clean and roomy.   Burger King has a decent menu and very reasonable prices. They often have specials and coupons (mailer/app/online): $1.99 for 10 chicken nuggets, parents pay attention!  Our go tos are: any breakfast sandwich combo, French toast sticks (they taste like delicious fried doughnuts), whopper and their bacon cheeseburger.   For a Monday morning it was nice and quiet with only a few customers. Our order came out fast and our food was hot and delicious, no probs with the staff or our orders.   Large playroom with cubbies for little ones to put their shoes in, bad part is the room smells like feet.  It's located on the corner of Lawrence and Markham on the same lot as the Cedarbrae Mall. I'm sure it gets crazy during peak hours especially since the bus stop is right outside their doors."}
{"text":"The staff are always friendly, the food is bad. I mean it's fast food, so you don't expect it to be insanely delicious but even this is pretty bad. Been here a couple of times since it's super close but won't return. The food is always old and the buns stale. Fries are always obviously old ones that got thrown in the fryer to heat them up. I hardly ever see vehicles here so I feel like it's never busy and the food just sits for too long and isn't fresh."}
{"text":"I'm going to agree with other reviews that state that THIS particular Burger King stands above the rest. Yes, the food is as you'd expect and (the consistency is there in a big way) but more than that is the exceptionally friendly and frankly surprisingly caring service from staff. Kudos to them and to management for obviously fostering a very positive work environment.  Want Burger King? Encourage strong management and great customer service and patronize this Burger King location."}
{"text":"This Burger King is the worst of them all however this isn't the only one that I've had issues at. About 6 months ago I decided to personally to boycott all Burger kings due to finding hair in my food. I've found hair in my food 4 different times at Burger King within 2 months time. Recently I decided to give them a second chance, I ordered a number 6 at this Burger King on 1/24/2018 after opening up the wrapper I took a bite and it was cold. Then I decided to put it in the microwave to heat it up. Before I put it in the microwave I looked down at the Burger I just bit into to find a LONG BLACK HAIR stringed around the cold cheese and bacon that was on the Burger.. nearly vomited. Next, I went back to explain the issue and no sorry for your experience what can I do to fix this from the employee. Finally I asked for a refund which was granted, then was given back the disgusting food I had ordered to throw away.  I Will not be going here again.. Ever! All Burger Kings for that matter. Way too over priced for disturbing experiences like this."}
{"text":"Food was as expected. The service was awful though. Not a single please or thank you. I felt as if being a customer was a bother. Judging by the consistently low rating that seems to be how they operate here. Until management indicates that they care about customer service at all I won't be back."}
{"text":"Visited today, 11/29 at 8:30am. Walked in and the.manager?, was at the front counter doing paperwork. My wife and I stood at the counter for two full minutes with the manager less than three feet away, and she ignored us. After those two minutes my wife and I turned to leave. Only then did the manager walk over to take our order. Even if she wasn't ignoring us, maybe she shouldn't do work at the counter that requires so much concentration that one doesn't notice customers come in. Terrible service. No apology from manager before we left. Will never be back"}
{"text":"Nastiest window staff... No napkins... Had to ask for my drink.... Can't believe I stopped and and was blown away about the teams lethargic attitude.... You guys definitely made an impression on me!!"}
{"text":"Really bad experience today! Had to wait 15 minutes outside for our drive-through meal. Then I went in, and everyone was working at literally half-speed. I wondered if they were protesting something! Finally, NO apology! We have been good customers, but we are doubtful about returning. ever. Train your people!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews for fast food establishments. However, when I wanted a juicy post mismosa drinking hamburger this was nearby and wow just wow! Great staff, yes ma'am thank you sir all kinds of wonderful customer service. Our order was made exactly as we wanted it. It wasn't a slopped together burger with the pickles half hanging out or large ugly stump pieces of lettuce. I am very impressed. Whoever the manger is, great job in motivating your employees and having such a positive team and successful store."}
{"text":"Not a franchise Burger King. They don't have specials and charge you twice as much as the one half a mile away. They are constantly out of stock of something every time I go. They don't take any Burger King coupons.  Besides not being able to stick their food they sell, the burgers taste like crap and the fries taste like tacos because they share with a taco time restaurant. Oh and can someone tell me why the hell I have to pull forward to receive my order when there's no one behind me. Oh that's right because they want their drive thru times to not be crap. NEVER go here unless you want shit food and crap service.   Update: Month later, went to purchase a whopper meal, price on the drive thru menu showed one price but when I pulled up to window they said it was .30 more. I told them the board said this price and they looked at their inside board and disagreed. I told them they could get out and look at their drive thru board as it was listed at not the price your stating.  The attendant looked at me blankly and asked what she should do. I said to not steal from people would be great.  So watch out for these scumbags! Now they steal."}
{"text":"I ordered a whopper dog and got the classic dog. I told I told the manager I wanted the Whopper dog but you had said they don't make them anymore. I I had asked the manager if they could put tomatoes and onions 2 make a Whopper dog but he only said no. I said doesn't Burger King supposed to do it your way and he said f*** no"}
{"text":"This location continues to provide cold food and bad service.  I placed my order and requested hot fries as I never get fresh hot fries.  Guess what, they were cold as usual.  Last time I came they had my order wrong.  Maybe they should take a lesson from Whataburger in customer service and quality food. They won't last long if they continue to fiction this way.  I live near by and I even took time today to let the Manager know that their building signs are not lite up at night.  She acted like it was no big deal and blamed Fry's for it.  I guess they don't mind that the building looks like it is closed at night when they are actually open."}
{"text":"This BK has the awesomest customer service and has for years. Even though this isn't the closest location to my home, I drive here because I know I'm going to get hot, fresh food and have a great interaction with the staff. The service is quick even though this location can get quite busy."}
{"text":"This Burger King is okay. I had no problem with my chicken fries but I did have a problem with the energy in the room. Definitely ruined my morning. I felt really bad when the manangers, a woman with long black hair & a man with tattoos were raising their voices & being super rude at their coworkers about the hashbrowns that were made. I understand that whatever the problem was with the hashbrowns shouldn't be served to the customers & I'm well aware just like any other restaurant you don't want to serve customers anything bad. However, I'm sure there's a better way to tell a coworker how to do their job or what they can improve on without raising your voices. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru service ever! Had to wait while two cars were taken on the second intercom. Finally backed out of the drive thru to go inside and it was locked during regular dining room hours! Tried drive thru again to get up to the window (only car in the drive thru) and told to wait to pay. Manager at window didn't even acknowledge us when handing food and drinks to us. Zero customer service at this location!"}
{"text":"They need loads of improvements super slow for fast food. Sitting in no line but put on hold 2 time while ordering from the drive through. I don't think they know what's going on yet it's a fairly new location. It have not had a good visit yet 0-3 if it wasn't so close to home I wouldn't go. I would recommend McDonald's in Walmart across the street."}
{"text":"Nothing great. No greeting when finally talked to at the counter basically just what can I get you. There were dirty cleaning products next to where you fill your drinks and a step stool as well as wet floor signs. The tone is depressing news for background noise instead of music. Have not had any great experiences from Burger King ever so I wouldn't expect it. But the chicken nugget deal is great"}
{"text":"Very rude customer service! A lady in the drive thru was very snotty and rolled her eyes at me when I asked kindly for a ice water. Considering my order only consisted of 3 things and there was no one in line but me. I will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Came here for cheap and fast food. And that's what I got and I am content with that. Food was good and service was ok. Not bad or great. Oh well, it's a Burger King; didn't expect much lol. Overall I'm satisfied. And to one of the reviewers (Eron A) It's a damn Burger King and you paid $1.49 for your 10 piece.. What did you expect? Lmao. Your review is laughable. Called the store for over 20 minutes over some $1.49 nuggets. Good job."}
{"text":"After a long day or walking around the strip a long long airport check point line and way too many drinks.. i found this holy place next to my gate. Literally they were the nicest people . The register lady was so polite and cheery and it was like 10pm she had a huge line but was happy to answer my very obvious questions. the food was fast and boy was that whopper amazing... and chicken fries. The place was SUPER CLEAN i than went back and asked for sauces... nobody gave me dirty looks .. the guy bagging the food gave me my sauces smiled and said \"mypleasure\" . Either im used to really crappy service at burger king back home or they really go above and beyond here. After all everyone is exhausted and quite cranky leaving vegas but these people continue to have a smile on their faces. Anyway great experience  here."}
{"text":"Dirty, unkept, messy dining area, windows, bathroom, dirty floors, counters. No team pride here and this is Goodyear a nice neighborhood . Where is the pride? Been here before and was just as dirty.  Look at the pictures."}
{"text":"Breanna is the best ! She helped me above and beyond ! Hooking me up by helping me with my bags (Target didn't double bag heavy items) and she helped me out with that. She was great/ fun / friendly l. The rest of the staff were great to. I don't normally say this about a fast food place but they definitely went above and buying customer service ! Thank you :) I'll be back for the Oreo cheesecake and Hershey pie !!"}
{"text":"I first came after they opened and almost wrote a different review, but glad I waited.  I will just say they must have had a problem person working there who seems to not be there any more, so I won't dwell on that person.  Attitude is so much better, friendly and upbeat service.   Everything is clean and new and staff seems to keep on top of things.  So far, I like that they seem to only have paying customers eating meals in the dining room.  Unfortunately, too many north Phoenix fast food places seem to let those with substance abuse problems have the run of the dining room.  Not to come off as a snob, but if you've eaten at other places in a five mile radius, you probably know what I mean.       Keep up what you're doing, good crew working for you!"}
{"text":"Best vanilla iced coffee out of all the burger kings I went to!!!!! I only go to this location!! Great service never had an issue there!"}
{"text":"I only at this location b/c there is nothing close by.  I try not to eat there at all really.  I've filled out numerous surveys from their reciepts and tried to explain to who ever reads them that this location is pretty bad.  Below are pictures of the Whopper Jr. I got.    I had to drive back from work and get a new one made.    Don't eat here.  #burgerking @burgerking"}
{"text":"One thing about Burger King that is great is that they serve \"Veggie Burgers\" that are actually quite tasty. They sometimes have you pull over in order for them to actually cook said burger but in the end it's worth it. Their whopper jr's are good and their fries aren't too shabby either. I feel they excel in burgers. Their chicken tenders/nuggets and sandwiches could be better but are edible to satisfy a hunger.  I was once given free cinnamon rolls (or something like it) because I was in a drive-thru for longer than expected. That was a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"(I would have given zero stars if I could have. ) Our visit took place August 17, 2015, 3:35pm.  First off the employees manning the counter seemed less than thrilled to greet us. The worn out, middle aged woman behind the counter begrudgingly took our order. I am so used to emphasizing the fact that I do not want ketchup or mayonnaise on my veggie burger. She stopped me several times to tell me that she basically didn't need to hear that I wanted mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, onion or pickle on my sandwich.  The other Burger King locations don't rebuke me so why should she?  There was a note stating that the broiler was out so she rudely stated that fact several times.  So the only options for my husband was to order chicken or fish. She made it quite obvious that we were a burden however we were very tired after a trying test.  We received our order and it wasn't at all appetizing. My side salad was wilted and my husband's sandwich was soggy. Well after our counter reception we were less than motivated to alert the employees.  Why should they be bothered to redo food when they were busy gossiping and having fun? These were older employees too. They were in their late 30s-early 50s. The woman that took our order was in her mid-forties, thin and about 5'3\" wearing a Burger King tshirt with gold medallion printed on the front.  David H was signed on the register but since she wasn't wearing a name tag I don't know what her name was. I definitely wasn't going to ask.  I swear that she probably saves on gas by taking a broom parked out back.   In conclusion my husband and I wholeheartedly agreed that we will wait to eat at McDonald's or In  'N Out. We love In 'N Out but we really needed to eat and felt that we wasted money eating here."}
{"text":"Drive Through is incredibly slow. My last drive through visit took 18 minutes with only 3 cars in line. I complained through corporate website and received free whopper coupons. Oh joy.  Tonight I thought I would try again... Asked for a whopper w/no tomato, add cheese and bacon which was repeated back to me, on the the receipt and charged for. I get home, guess what?  No cheese, no bacon but I did get those tomatoes!    Don't ever plan on going back there."}
{"text":"New fast food addition to downtown. The workers were all really friendly. We only ordered a drink and cookies. The dining room is small but a good use of space. Hopefully the small space will stop teens from loitering (like wood st McDonald's for example)."}
{"text":"I thought after the remodel it would've better because it honestly couldn't have gotten worse... it's the same though.   Same cold fries, overdone chicken sandwiches, same annoying kids still loitering and hanging inside without buying food.   On a positive note, the workers are nice and they have that futurerama Coke machine ;)  Please do something about the loitering. Alot of business is getting lost because you let 14-17 year olds chill, talk loud and reckles... cursing up a storm. No employee says anything.. Yet they didn't spend $1 to contribute to your sales :/"}
{"text":"Service is always good when I come but the food is hit or miss. Today was a miss everything was cold."}
{"text":"My family does not do a lot of fast food, so when we do it is a treat and a big deal. We planned ahead what we were going to get like we always do. My kids had their list ready. When we began to order at the drive thru it was one let down after another. We asked for an icee but the machine was broken. We then asked for root beer and they were out. We got home and they completely forgot a whole meal, which was on the receipt and paid for. So we had to go back. At the end of the meal my daughter went to open her toy which was supposed to be Garfield, but it was a Dolphin Tale 2 toy, which came out two years ago, and the toy was a marker, so since it had been sitting for 2 years it was dry and unusable. What a waste. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Food is generally cold. On the off chance you do get fresh food it will be about as tasty as you'd expect burger king to be."}
{"text":"Over the last 22 years we have watched this Burger King go thru many changes. When we first moved into our house 21+ years ago this was our first meal in our new neighborhood. Our girls were very young and we had no other places to eat around. We ate here quite a bit over the next few years.   More businesses moved in along with a few more eating places in the area. However the one thing that never changed was this Burger King. Sure there are good days and bad days but overall this place is the best.  They added the computerized drink machine so the sodas have a gray variety and something for everyone every caffeine free diet sodas. The last couple of times we have eaten her the fries have come out so hot I can't eat them.   This is a fast food restaurant and they all make mistakes. Give this place a break and try."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would.  My husband and I ordered 2 very simple sandwiches and they managed to mess up both of them unfortunately we didn't realize one of them was wrong until we were already too far away to go back.  I don't expect much when it comes to crap fast food but when I'm paying $25 for 2 sandwiches I expect it to be right."}
{"text":"Couldn't even bother to fill the coffee I paid for up all the way? I feel like they gave me someone's leftovers since it wasn't even hot."}
{"text":"Obviously it's a Burger King so there's not much to expect, but of the many times I've been here it has never really let me down. Food is almost always hot and the line is never held up. Pretty good as far as fast food goes."}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm admitting to going to this place but need to forewarn others. I was desperate w a sleeping kid in the car after a long hike and was ready to eat the arse out of a yak. Wish I'd gone that route.  DON'T go here. Keep driving until you hit another place. Ordered a cheeseburger and chix sandwich which was burnt but cold, an interesting combination. Absolutely disgusting. Clearly these had been overcooked, sat around for awhile, and then somewhat reheated.  If i could have gone back, i would have. The customer service was as good as the food.  Bleck!"}
{"text":"You never want to start my day off with an argument, when Im in a rush AND on an empty stomach.....oh AND on a Saturday morning. Unfortunately that's exactly what happened this past Saturday. We live about a mile from here, and in the 5 years of living in this neighborhood Ive probably stopped here twice. Perhaps for an unknown reason...until now. I of course got their big ol' coupon page in the mail, and after not having time to eat before a car appointment decided to get me and the kid some breakfast sandwiches and a coffee. Sounds simple, right???!!! For anyone with brains it is at least. I specifically ordered what the coupon referenced, the two sandwiches, hashbrown, and coffee. I pulled up to the window, gave him my coupon, and simply asked, can I substitute the hot coffee for a cold one, if not no biggie. Apparently that threw the kid totally off. I was handed not only the hot coffee, but a cold one as well. After pulling past the window to avoid holding up the line, I looked at the receipt and realized I was charged for both coffees, not only that but they gave us no napkins or straws. This set me off. Unfortunately the 6 year old had to witness it. We pulled back in, got out of the car, and asked for the manager (who was NOT the one at the drive thru window. As nicely as possible, I explained to him what happened, and he had the nerve to tell me it was MY fault. Sir, I speak English, and clearly. I know what I said, and what I asked for. Give me my correct change, and I will get my own damn napkins. Never again. Incompetent rude employees will keep me away from any place, regardless of what they are selling. Perhaps Burger King should pay their employees more than minimum wage and we can deal with people who actually give a s**t about the people who are paying for their services."}
{"text":"There is nothing outstanding about the food at this location. They are Burger King. Isn't that the point of fast food?  Continuity. What I really like? They are right off the belt line so they are fast. This is outstanding. Even when the line is out of the parking lot, they get you through quickly."}
{"text":"Guving 4 stars to the manager Miss. Dottie.  Very friendly when in one day did not receive all of our order called and miss dotty made everything right in our next visit very satisfied she even upgraded everything when we went back to end very pleasant to work with and very clean restaurant"}
{"text":"I come to this specific location every friday, there are always junkies pan handling inside and outside the establishment.  Currently at 8:13 pm there is someone with a computer no food just lingering around he reaks and looks like a bum.  This is very surprising for boulder city, also resteraunt is understaffed and needs to be cleaned"}
{"text":"Food is almost always old and cold here. The people that run the place must not care as long as its turning a profit. I stopped going here for years and tried it again to see if it had changed. Nope. Don't go here"}
{"text":"Me and my family went here for a snack we love the place coz our kids enjoyed their play area the place is not crowded the ambience is nice plus the customer service is excellent especially meckel so polite and very helpful, so I ordered a bk Joe ice coffee vanilla i thought it was the regular ice coffee that i usually order but it wasn't it was my fault so I order a new one and she said nevermind she's will just replace it with the new one i was impressed that's a top box customer service right there..well definitely go back to this place...."}
{"text":"If you get your order to go, check it before you leave.  I ordered the two crispy chicken sandwich for $6 (the one advertised on TV).  When I got home I got the processed chicken patty sandwiches.  I checked other reviews and it's obvious that staff gets the orders wrong pretty frequently.  I don't like the bait and switch scam.  I won't be back for a few years, that will be enough time to fire the present staff and management, maybe the new employees will have better training."}
{"text":"Burger King is now open.  Be careful if you order take out.  I ordered take out of the 2 for $6 crispy chicken.  When I got home, it was the processed chicken patty, not the crispy chicken they show on the TV advertisement.  They did a bait and switch.  It's no wonder why they get such poor ratings.  I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Been there three times in the past year and got the samr results on a clasic chicken sandwitch, ordered it with cheese and extra mayo, we got no cheese no mayo and why over cooked. Angie the manger did not seem to care"}
{"text":"They sold me still icy cold crispy chicken fresh from the freezer! Ugh, never again!  Out of all the burger kings - this one had to meet below standards"}
{"text":"Waste of $$ & TIME. \"COLD FOOD , with Nonchalant, K.M.A. Served up regardless of Customer requests!! Asked for my Whopper Jr. Combo , 2 -Cheeseburgers to be \"Remade \". Oh No, excuses of You were called 5 Minutes Ago. I got 3 Drinks & returned to counter. Who's paying WHO??   Keep driving. I know you won't get it Your Way at Burger King!! Piss & Poor wanted to give ZERO!!"}
{"text":"I was in a hurry and BK was close by. I was so surprised to see that they had brought the \"Rodeo Cheeseburger\" back! I have been still ordering it after all these years since the \"Little Soldiers\" gem disappeared from the menu I just had to customize a regular Cheeseburger to do so. It was cheap yummy!  The store was clean inside and I did use the restroom to wash my hands and it was clean too. The cashier was friendly."}
{"text":"The absolute worst Burger King in Merica! Since day one, they've screwed-up every order. I gave them a couple of months to get their act together and went back last night (out of desperation). They still manage to be idiots. It's mostly young 20 something's who run the place at night. They look like they're just there to collect a check. The place looks desolate most days, so I'm thinking other people have gotten screwed over too. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"HOLY TOLEDO batman!  I just went through the drive thru and they got my order RIGHT and it tasted GOOD!  This is a first for this location!  I only got a rodeo cheeseburger so maybe it was because I didn't make it too hard on them ?!?! ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped in around 8am this morning to get breakfast and head to work I ordered 2 breakfast sandwiches which came to approx $7 I asked if I can get a large ice water as I do not drink coffee and it was too early for soda. The lady tells me no I can only give you a clear 8oz cup. My response to the rude employee in the drive thru was \"what am I 5 years old?\" I mean in buying food I just wanted a large ice water with a lid not a shot glass for of water that will more than likely spill all over my car by the time I get to work. So I just left telling her she could keep my food as I will go elsewhere which is exactly what I did. I mean I get it if they want to charge me the cost of the cup 5 cents that's fine but don't be ridiculous. I will never come back so I hope that 5 cent cup was worth it. Shame on you Burger King get it together."}
{"text":"Okay so this is a fast food chain restaurant but I've always liked BK more than McD...but it seems to have gone down hill.  Can a fast food place go further down a hill?   Yes they can.  See why:  Every time I mistakenly decided to come here cause it's close to home I regretted it.  First time the drive thru person was just not very friendly.  When I pull up to the window I see why...a cholita with a painted on eye liner face.  Her poor make up choice doesn't mean she needs to be rude but she was. Yikes!  Next time...took f...o...r...e...v...e...r.  BK has always not been the fastest in/put drive thru but this time I thought I was at Carl's Jr with that wait time.  And last time...(my last time) I decided to give this place one last chance and try out their highly advertised chicken nugget deal to rival McD's deal. THEY WERE OUT!  Who runs out of nuggets you advertise for a billion times a day...now of course it could have been the case that this deal was so popular that they simply could not meet the demand...that was not the case.  Poor ordering by the management.  Done with this place. Which my thighs will be happy about anyway."}
{"text":"This place will kill someone. The graveyard shift is slow and doesn't know how to cook chicken. They gave me an order of chicken nuggets that was still raw on the inside. I don't even want my money back I just want them to learn how to properly cook food before they kill someone."}
{"text":"This place is utter garbage. The burger patties themselves actually have good flavor but everything else is terrible. My whopper with cheese literally had two pieces of unmelted kraft singles thrown on there and the fries had zero salt. A child could make a better presented burger."}
{"text":"The night manager needs to greet guests or say thank you at least. No personality and should not be the role model of the restaurant. The stale fries didn't even bother me as much as his interaction with us at the register."}
{"text":"Extremely shocked by the rude treatment from an employee named Tao. I will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"Terrible. So slow. Waited over 25 mins in drive thu.  Got our order wrong on top of it too. And the workers kept coming outside looking at the menu. Didn't have a clue what was going on. Even a cook came out with his gloves on and went back inside. Who even knows if he changed them. Won't be back here. Oh and David if the drive though you have terrible customer services skills. No smile. Didn't apologize for wait."}
{"text":"Rudest experience I've ever had at a Burger King. They don't even take coupons. Who doesn't even take coupons. Cheap."}
{"text":"I usually get friendly service here. There is often at least one error in my orders, however. This is ok as long as i eat in, which i often do since theres a HUGE, really nice indoor kids play area (which gets them an extra star!) However , when going thru the drivethru, expect a wait, and CHECK YOUR ORDER! Preferably before leaving the drivethru!"}
{"text":"Burger king is Burger king ....Food is fast food and is what it is . It's a big cheesy burger a big old whopper !  The location is a bit Dingy ...bit dirty and well not the best but if u feel like a whopper a greasy burger Come get one !"}
{"text":"From all the fast food burger places Burger King is my favorite.  Some BK are just horrible.  This one is very nice.  It is clean.  Most of the employees are nice.    There is one young gentleman who is the sweetest cashier.  He always has a very sweet smile and treats everybody with kindness and respect.  I was there today and as usual - he was very professional and smiling away.  He is very attentive to everyone.  He always smiles and leans in to the customer while making direct eye contact.  I hope that I remembered his name correctly.  It was Darby, or Derby, Daney.  He is going to be a successful young man someday."}
{"text":"I dont understand why Boulder City burger king sucks so bad. 15 minutes minimum waiting to order. Crappie service with inexperienced workers. It's finally my turn to order and the girl says \" your gonna have to wait at least 15 minutes to order because they are under staffed. If You want food, wait!  The worst...."}
{"text":"I don't normally yelp fast food places. When I ordered a crispy tender chicken sandwich it came out cold. I asked if I could have a hot chicken sandwich. When I received it back, the tomato & lettuce was completely wilted from the \"warm-up\" & the crispy tender was now soggy, steamy. People, take some pride in your job! Everyone works hard for the money!"}
{"text":"We needed a place to get a cold drink, let the two year old kiddo play and work off some energy after a shopping trip, and give Mommy the chance to relax and feed the tiny munchkin.  This place was perfect.  The room with the toddler play area was closed off from the rest of the restaurant so our little Banshee could let off steam without disturbing unsuspecting customers, there was no one else in the playground area so Mommy had lots of privacy for her first nursing in public attempt (under cover of course), we were in air conditioned comfort while it was in the high nineties outside, the area was clean, so it was a win-win situation for all.  Thank you for accommodating us Burger King!"}
{"text":"The establishment was up to standards of any other Burger King. It was clean, well kept, and seemed to have had a recent remodel. The bathroom was slightly dirty but nothing terrible. Service was quick, the food was extremely fresh, and the value was great. I would recommend this location and I am very likely to return when I want some fresh chicken fries."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru on a Wednesday evening, only 2 cars ahead of us, and it took them 15 mins just to take our order, another 10 minutes to get our food. After we drove back home, realised they fucked up the order. Worst customer service, 0/5."}
{"text":"This Burger King lives in the food court underneath the monstrosity known as the Sheppard Centre. It's the most popular restaurant in the underground, sadly. I go on occasion when I'm visiting what's left of the stores here (the Coles closed recently). The most recent time I went, the cashier took one order at a time and waited until it was packed in the bag before taking the next order. Another staff member stood beside him and made change, then disappeared into the back. People dropped out of line and went elsewhere. The food was okay--what you'd expect from Burger King."}
{"text":"Refuses to get order right. You orser a whopper with no onions.....how hard is that to accomplish.  Be ready for them to mess up a simple order."}
{"text":"I get that this location is in an airport and it's busy but they are very unorganized calling numbers regardless of sequence by the time I got my food it was cold and the people behind the counter were rude and had an attitude... there was one lady that was trying to help and get the food out quickly but still had an attitude... they need to come up with a better system to make sure that customers get their food before it gets cold"}
{"text":"I stop in at this location a couple times a month as I work nearby.  I have never gone inside but the drive through is always speedy.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  My order is always accurate.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Tonight the girl at the drive through window (shawni?) actually rolled her eyes at my boyfriend when he asked for bbq and ranch.. then she gave us ONE ranch and ONE bbq for our TWO sandwiches and order of chicken fries lol. Food sucked and service sucked smh"}
{"text":"So we order 2 sandwiches and 2 ten piece nuggets. Nobody behind us in drive thru and once again  they ask me to pull up.why??? Only on the ford smh...then we waited for 15 mins wow"}
{"text":"I rate this burger king as a 5 star for ONE REASON...every time I come here they have me pull forward and wait for my chicken sandwich. Most people would typically get frustrated with these actions, but I appreciate the fresh chicken and not giving me a reheated patty.   I don't mind waiting two min for fresh food...instead of choking down a dried out microwaved chicken sandwich.   Either way...I rarely eat fast food, but this location is bearable."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but the service is a little slow. This is my little sister's favorite place to eat and we try and come by at least once a week. It's always clean and everyone's nice I just wish the service were faster. For fast food, it's definitely not fast. But it's definitely better than McDonald's in my opinion."}
{"text":"SupppppperSlow with bad service. Snotty lady at dive up and the person taking the order should not be taking to customers!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the most slowest place I have ever been to. McDonald's is quicker than they are I will never go back to Burger King again it has taken me 20 minutes to get my order and get back to work and that's going through the drive-thru that's ridiculous that's not the first time it's done that to people."}
{"text":"The place is great and the stuff is so friendly and very nice,my daughter love to go this place!! She like it and they have nice playground area!!!"}
{"text":"This Burger King location tries really hard to provide good service.  It is obvious they have issues with employees.  I have heard arguments between employees that lead to me getting the wrong order because they are distracted.  Management is always apologetic, but it is an uphill battle.  That being said, the food is generally well served, fresh and warm.  If you are in the neighborhood it is convenient, but don't be surprised at the service."}
{"text":"Convenient location to shopping.  In general, Burger King has an acceptable menu.  This location suffers from inconsistent service and quality of food.  If you get there on a good day, you will be happy, otherwise, not so much."}
{"text":"Ordering the breakfast platter first thing in the morning and they're already out of butter. Assuming the food is old or reheated because it's really chewy and the biscuits are just crumbling apart. Please stop being so lazy about your job."}
{"text":"Good stop for breakfast.  Food always hot and ready to go.  OK service.  BK is always trying to change their menu to handle changing tastes.  OK to stop here."}
{"text":"This location had a major makeover in 2012.  The facility is nicer, the service and food seem better as well.  Typical BK menu.  Food is fresh, served warm.  Convenient location to the Clinic.  Good choice for fast food in the area."}
{"text":"Hit & miss. Sometimes the folks are nice, but most of the time, the employees are rude & slow. On my last visit, I just ordered a burger, no ketchup. What did I get? Extra ketchup. My friend ordered a chicken sandwich without tomato. What did he get? Tomatoes on his sandwich.  They tend to get my order wrong every time, so I just stopped going there."}
{"text":"Always clean, friendly staff. Take my child to play-place here now & then."}
{"text":"No complaints here.   They always get my order correct, they have always had fresh onion rings for me, the drive thru window people have always been polite and good listeners (if there is a misunderstanding, they ask follow up questions instead of just throwing whatever in the bag).   For instance:  Me: I'd like a sweet tea Them: A peach tea? Me: No, a sweet tea Them: An unsweet tea? Me: Huh? No. A sweet tea. Te dulce con azucar sin melocotones.  Them: Te sin azucar? Me: lol stop it! You're just messing with me.  Them: hahahaha! We'll get you a sweet tea. No peaches.   I'll be back to this one when it's time to get my car washed again (even though it's in a sketchy-ish part of the 'hood).   I really enjoy these little chats."}
{"text":"Food was great but the attitude of Jose was terrible needs to taught how to respect customers not just ignore them... At least say respectfully \"I'm sorry but we are currently out of lemonade\""}
{"text":"Drive through order...nothing was repeated back to me, and I was not asked what drink I wanted with my meal. Only thing girl said to me was \"here\" when she handed me the food. 5/10/16@ 8pm."}
{"text":"Today was the second time in the past three weeks that my husband attempted to purchase pancakes after 10:30 but before 10:45 and was told that they don't have any more batter for them. It stinks that their advertising says ALL DAY breakfast available and you still can't get it before 11 a.m."}
{"text":"The cleanest BK I've ever been to. Nice employees. Kids area clean, too. (Didn't smell like dirty feet!) only thing is, there wasn't anything ground level for smaller kids to play with."}
{"text":"Yes I love Burger King. Yes I know its terrible for me. No I will not stop coming here.   I love this location, even though someone was shot in the face here not too long ago, I still can not stay away. I love the fact that I can go through the drive-thru and not have to worry about checking my bag for the right items because they have never messed up one order of mine. And that is pretty damn rare for fast food.  Other than that typical BK fare."}
{"text":"I have to defend this local BK as it has gotten of a lot of bad reviews.(not saying they were not called for) But as of moving to Stallings and having this as the closest quick fast food they are not bad at all. We have gotten to know the crew, don't know if that helps, but everything is fresh, hot, and never a messed up order.  The burger buns even look like the commercial and not squished!! Overall good experience, will return for sure."}
{"text":"This location can never get my order right. I asked for chicken fries and got chicken nuggets once. I didn't realize until I left.   I got cheetohs chicken fries and onion rings this time. I really couldn't tell if the cheetohs chicken fries sucked or if they messed up and gave me regular chicken fries. And I don't think their onion rings are actual onions. They taste like they use onion flavored batter."}
{"text":"Not bad...normal burger king....descent food and service but the soda machine was broken.  Not cool."}
{"text":"How can I even start this??? I was really hungry, so I pulled into my local BK. I would of usually just gone though the drive-thru, but the    line was way backed up. As I walked in they were speaking the  Mexican.  So I stood there for like 3 minutes before I was even acknowledged. I ordered the chicken fry meal with a rodeo burger. The food was average, and the rodeo burger didn't have any sauce. I sat down to a filthy table, keep in mind I was the only one there. I ate my food and ordered a milkshake on my way out. They were out of the milkshake cups and just gave it to me in a non milkshake up. Which really offset the mood of drinking a milkshake. I will probably go back to the BK. Just because I'll be able 5o write another review. I have attached pictures of the rodeo burger and the disgusting table I sat at."}
{"text":"You had one job!!!!  ONE !!! Put the damn food I paid for in the bag!!!! Is it really that hard!!!! It was 3 things!!! You managed to get two in the bag, but adding the third item was just too hard!"}
{"text":"Got to be the worst location in Las Vegas. How can you screw up multiple things after having to have things repeated twice and then having a Manager double-check it? Ordered 4 orders of chicken nuggets, only got 2 but got sauces for 4. Ordered 4 Whoppers, got 2 and 2 Big Kings. How in the hell do you Multi-Screw like that?"}
{"text":"Worst location in entire country. A Dbl Whopper Meal & 3-pc Chicken Strips, $17.50  2 people in line and it takes 12 minutes to get an order?  Chicken Strips had been re-heated at least 3 times. Asked for sauce to smother the leather, was told Id have to pay extra. Threw one on the floor and it sounded like a golf ball bouncing."}
{"text":"Rude ass mouthy ass manager messed up my order and when I called to complain she had so much attitude. I'm a person of action so I went back to get my correct order and to make sure this bitch wanted to say all the slick shit she had to say on the phone, to my face. She had nothing but stank ass attitude no edges and a flat ass. Never coming here again. Worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"Zero stars if I could. I used to work here. Management is terrible. I was never once given a break when I deserved one, the so called \"team leaders\" are unbelievably disrespectful and inconsiderate. I'm naming names. \"Ari\" is by no means a team leader. She'd roll her eyes at me, belittle me, and criticize everything I do. The head manager is very unprofessional. Every time I needed something she'd always be out back smoking and joking with her favorite employees. They're all grouchy, low life 30+ year olds who never made anything of their lives and they're mad because they're stuck here. Other customers, I'm sorry you have to read all my ranting, but I just want you to get to know the people you're giving your hard earned money to. Not to mention the food is DISGUSTING. I suggest you take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst burger king in the contiguous United States. There is nothing more frustrating when the employees cannot comprehend a computer screen!  I place my order with a super nice and friendly MJ. Then i get to the window to get my order. No hi, No smile, just \"whats your order\". I tell the miserable Juan that i ordered a chicken sandwich and a diet coke. She gives me a Dr Pepper?  Wtf?  You just asked me!   Her DGAF attitude continues while they are trying to figure out my order. The order was then completed by a guy who at least said thanks!  Shame on Burger King for having this girl represent them. Either no comprehension of customer service or zero training. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I've tried to call this location many times but the phones always busy. Food is not good. Employees refuse to do simple tasks that I ask. The new manager ever slacks."}
{"text":"Went through drive through at 250 pm today.  The guy at the window  never spoke just mouthed words !?  .  He could talk heard him talk to his co worker.  Never told me how much I owed just grabbed my 20.  No receipt either.  Poor customer service.  We just got cokes so can't say anything about the food"}
{"text":"This place is a joke... sitting in the drive through for 30 min for a burger is ridiculous.. I wish I would have read the previous poor reviews before coming here.. no Diet Coke.. drive through service is terrible and embarrassing... finally got food and the fries were old and inedible.. burgers seem to be hours old."}
{"text":"Over the years I have stopped by this location a few times.  This time I was hungry and drawn in by the buy one get one free offer on the original chicken sandwich, which I think is one of their better staple items, at $3.99.  I did check out the restrooms this trip and found them to be clean and stocked."}
{"text":"Yeah, I should know better.  But they were close and easy to get in and out of and I forgot to bring the lunch I was planning on so I was hungry.  I should also stick to a couple of things they do reasonably well like Whoppers and the original chicken sandwich.  I got the mushroom Steakhouse burger and for a premium $4.99 burger I was unimpressed.  I have been going to this location on occasion for the last 16 years.  A few years back they tore it down and rebuilt it from the ground up to match their newer offerings.  They have managed to keep it in pretty good shape.  Shortly before the rebuild the building to the East got a facelift and more recently Circle K built a new gas/mini mart on the corner.  They always seem to have a minimal staff but the line moves fairly quickly even at lunch."}
{"text":"Driving down Central the other day I got the munchies mid morning.  I got a croissant sandwich.  The palce was clean, the service was pleasant, and my sandwich was cooked fresh."}
{"text":"I found myself near this BK outpost  the other day and hungry.  I knew they were again running their buy one, get one free offer on the original chicken sandwich so that is what I got.  I got them to go. The order came up quick and was correct.  The way this older unit was built the dining area is sort of around the corner from the order window so I cannot comment on it."}
{"text":"This place sucks! They got my order wrong 4 times and told me to go to McDonald's for a double cheese burger. The manager could have added an extra cheese and I would have gladly paid for it. I'm only giving a star because I have too. They got our hot dogs wrong and my burger wrong 4 times. I will never come back here again! As I walked away they were taking and laughing at me l, the manager could use a bit more training and so could the staff! This place is a JOKE! He was also speaking Spanish and I understood every word be said."}
{"text":"Once again Burger King is screwing up DoorDash drivers!!! Each restaurant that has a tablet has ten minutes to prepare an order before a dasher is given an assignment. Then it takes dashers time to get to the restaurant. You would think these orders would be done but no. I was just informed by the manager that they will not make an order until a dasher arrives which contradicts the use of the tablet. DoorDash only gives dashers 5-9 mins to pick up tablet orders. Not only that but they make dashers wait in line to order the food. They don't allow us to go through the drive thru. Due to all of these factors they cause dashers to deliver food to customers very late making it look like drivers are the problem. Educate yourselves. Tablet orders are supposed to be made before we arrive!!! If you want to do orders like jack and Taco Bell then make it to where we can go through the drive thru and order the food and pay with our red card and get rid of the tablet so DoorDash gives us the appropriate time to wait for these orders. Your screwing with peoples lively hood!!"}
{"text":"I work for Doordash and I normally go through the drive thru for fast food orders as it's faster to get customers their food in a timely manor and to meet my delivery time. This was my first experience with this store. I went to the drive up speaker when I was greeted with laugher from a girl inside. My husband tells her we're here for a doordash order as we normally do for any other drive thru. She rudely tells us we have to go inside because the order isn't ready. About 5-7 min before our arrival we get a text that tells us that our order is ready for pick up. The restaurant is responsible for that text therefore implying the text was a lie. We arrived right at our pick up time on the nose when this happened. So my husband tells her it's weird we normally get our food in the drive thru is there anyway to get it this way because we had a car behind us and in front of us and had no way to park and go inside. She said nothing so we pulled up to the window. This girl literally ignored us at the window. She gave us dirty looks acknowledging we were there but wouldn't say a word. So he goes in because at this point he doesn't have a choice and the bag is completely sealed with stickers making it impossible to tell whether or not the order is correct. It is part of our checklist on our app to check off that every item is inside before we leave with it. He doesn't argue with them because it would make us later than we were. Of course all of these antics make us late for our delivery and we get blamed for being late. I hope someone higher up sees this and deals with these child like employees. If not I will be calling myself as this is effecting my way of living."}
{"text":"Love the grilled chicken sandwich, place is very clean and staff members very friendly."}
{"text":"The original chicken sandwich is still super, it's gotten a little smaller over the years. It's not on my regular diet anymore but for this occasion it met all my demands."}
{"text":"Thank heavens for your drive thru. Thank heavens for the ability to keep my children in the car to get their dinner. Why, you may ask, is the drive thru so important? Because as I drove by the main entrance to this Burger King, there were FIVE Burger King employees  standing no more than 2 feet away from the front door, ALL smoking cigarettes. These were not ecigs,  these were cancer causing, polluting cigarettes filling the air and no doubt entering the air within the restaurant, as the door was wide open.  Had I been trying to enter the actual restaurant with my small children, I would have turned around and left, choosing to protect my off spring from your 2nd hand smoke.   Please add a little more professionalism, consideration for others, and class to your business."}
{"text":"absolute waste of money. got chicken fingers it was dry and COLD... went down the garbage disposal would not give it to my dog."}
{"text":"Burger King scews themself again!  Who is running this franchise?  They don't know what they are doing.  What I am referring to is that they took their best new burgers off their menu and went back to the old Whopper and basic blah.  What the heck!?  They got us back with their angus and Texas burgers and now they don't carry those anymore.   Staff is good and the store is clean and the fries are good.   This place is only good for some fries so why go here.  I suggest Wendy's or for something different Popeye's if you want fast food."}
{"text":"I must say with the amount of business this Burger King does it has always been accurate, fast and declicious.  They have the best chicken sandwich (The Original) in town.  I would have given 5 stars but, the trash can in the drive thru when you are exiting is always full and overflowing.  Who wants to drive over trash?  Not me....."}
{"text":"My visit was on 12/14/15 I have to say, fast food usually has a bad rep when it comes to customer service.  This place is an exception to that.  The staff and the atmosphere is friendly and inviting.  I actually came in to get my meal to go and ended staying because the folks behind the counter were so upbeat and happy.  Customer service at its best.  The lady who helped me, Jenny, was so informative about the menu.  I came in for a drink and a cheeseburger, but Jenny let me know about all the specials they were offering and I ended getting something new for a change and it was a good call.  This place is more then a fast food joint, the employees take pride in the service they provide and have fun while doing so."}
{"text":"Clean environment with kind employees, unfortunately food was lukewarm. I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Burger King I've been to in Vegas! The service was horrible. It's your job to be patient and polite especially when people are trying to decide what they want in the drive through. After being rushed to order, they got my order COMPLETLY wrong and charged me for extra food that I didn't even order?! This was such a horrible experience to start off my day. If I could have gave 0 stars I would have."}
{"text":"This is the most nastiest Burger King I ever went to. They always get orders wrong. Their food is cold is disgusting. They never give you the condiments you ask for. It's literally a trash bag of a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Terrible service from rude, disrespectful, inattentive employee. My fiancé and I had a very small order at a slow time of the day. The employee was clearly agitated that she had to make any effort at all. She rushed through giving us or drink, asked if we wanted a receipt, to which we said yes and then she closed the window and went back to her distasteful conversation with a coworker. We waited and tried to get her attention for some time before she could finally be bothered to open the window and then was snotty about being asked to print the piece of paper she had asked if we wanted. We are very frustrated and disappointed that we spent any money at a place whose employees can't even follow through with simple requests."}
{"text":"No STARS!!! This place parks cars, like there's no tomorrow! The car in front of me pulled up, I pulled up, the 3 cars behind me pulled up. Apparently, they aren't equipped to handle the business, they are in! I watched everyone get their order, so I gone in, a little upset, and ask how long it takes for a chicken sandwich and onion rings? \"Oh, sorry, they forgot to drop the rings, would you like something else?\" No, I've waited 15 minutes, just give me my money back! That place was not worth my 15 minutes!"}
{"text":"For being a fast food restaurant the service here was really slow. I got a chicken sandwich and the chicken was surprisingly dried out. The only thing that is really good here is the chocolate pie dessert."}
{"text":"Horrible service... I felt rushed and the food was basically thrown at me even though there weren't any other customers around."}
{"text":"I stopped here after working late. There was a car in front of me and service was taking awhile. I just figured the car had a large order. However, my service was also slow. I have been here before and had quicker service so I won't hold it against them.   The chicken nuggets and fries were hot and the taste was as expected.    The everyday meals are priced well and maybe the most reasonable out of the big 3."}
{"text":"Closest Burger King to my house, this place is really bad. The food is atrocious, never correct, stay away from this establishment."}
{"text":"Charges more than listed price - be careful!  Ordered the Combo 6 - Egg Normous Burrito - is priced at $6.19 on the sign where you place your order at the drive-thru.  However, as shown on my receipt, I was charged $6.98 - a $.79 difference.  I drove back thru the drive-thru and discussed this with Billy (the MOD).  He initially stated that it was because I got a medium soda instead of coffee.  When I pointed out that I paid an additional $.70 for the soda, he then stated it was because I got a medium hash brown vs. the small hash brown.   I told Billy that I found it hard to believe that the difference between a small and a medium hash brown was $.79 and wanted to know the prices of a small and a medium hash brown.  Billy simply stated that the $.79 price difference WAS because I asked for a medium hash brown.  Note: I ordered by the # and stated I wanted coke to drink.  The person taking my order stated 'do you want medium or large' - I said medium as I thought those were my only choices.  It appears they use this verbiage to trick the consumer and increase sales.  Wording should be that this includes a small xxx, would you like to upgrade to a medium or large.   This is about principle and honesty.  Bait and switch scenario."}
{"text":"Showed up at 8p on a Tuesday (drove out of our way) only to find out they closed and hour early!  Us and four other customers stood outside trying to find out what the hell happened and the manager just peeked his head out and then hid like a scared child!  Horrible service!  Horrible!"}
{"text":"Don't bother spending your money here. They forget orders, give you nasty old fries, and blame you for them not getting the food. You are better off somewhere else."}
{"text":"Bathrooms are locked have to ask manager to get in which I understand but if they lock them why don't they clean them? So disgusting  Second the onionrings were cooked to long they were like rubber and when I told the lady she said that's how we make them. She"}
{"text":"No one needs a review of the food at Burger King, right?  No one is going there for their culinary masterpieces.  But no judgment, obviously I went there and we all need that grease bomb sometimes, right?   There's a 75% chance it's because you're hungover.    But I came here to review the service.  Today I went through the drive thru for lunch - right in the middle of the lunch rush, about 12:15.  I placed my order and at the window and they asked me to pull around because they were making fresh fries.  No problem!  Love it when the fries are freshly saturated in hot transfatty oils... mmmm...   ANYWAY... I pulled around, and I listened to the radio and played on my phone for awhile and then I realized a few other customers had come and gone since I parked and I figured they'd probably ordered fries, too, so someone forgot to bring my food out.  I got out of the car pretty annoyed - I mean, I'm not a crazy person (not in that way) so I wasn't ready to blow up or anything, just peeved off.  Then I went in the store, told them what happened and the entire crew, I kid you not, stopped for a beat and all looked so horrified.  And there were a lot of crew members on because of the lunch rush.  My heart went out to them so much, we all make mistakes at work, right?  Especially when we're busy.  Took them about 29 seconds to get my order in my hands and I received a thousand apologies.    I was so impressed, I wish I had said something then and I hope my tone was polite when I told them what the situation was.  I also hope that this is a reflection of good management and the employees are taken care of and valued.    To be honest, I hope I don't visit your establishment often but thank you for your prompt response and I promise to make you my hangover stop from now on... ok, maybe that will be fairly often........ ;-)"}

He told us we could go some where else so we said fine we will . He refunded or money and left.  He also threw his employees under the bus saying he was busy at drive thru and if they rang it up wrong it was not his fault!! Wow that's pretty bad management."}

{"text":"When did the Burger Kings of Toronto get so ghetto? At one time Burger King, or BK as the hipsters started to call it, was the virtuous alternative to McDonald's. BK didn't fry its meat. It flame broiled it. You could eat your Whopper with some degree of smug self-satisfaction knowing flame broiled meant better. You weren't sure why it was better. Probably because Emmanuel Lewis vouchsafed for the preparation method. And his eternal youth was assured. So why not you too?  And any true Star Wars fan will know, BK, not McDonald's, was the only fast food joint allowed to carry Star Wars, Empire, and Jedi themed merch. George Lucas allowed the BK tie in as, apparently, he grew up eating BK. So you should too. Not like he ever got fat. Or became a hated asshole.  BK was also a fast food joint that understood YOUR lifestyle. First, you could get a paper crown on demand. Second, most restaurants were open late. It was a place you could chill out after a bar or night club and analyze with your friends exactly why you were in a BK after a night at a club and not in the back seat of your car with one of the hundreds of drunk and \"looking\" women you watched bump and grind on the dance floor from the safety of that dark wall in the back of the club. You kept the beer warm, so there's that. If only you remembered to get the paper crown BEFORE going to the club and whipping that out at 1 am and charging out onto the dance floor and doing the white guy stomp with your best buddies , maybe the night would have turned out differently. Well, note to self.  These days, alas, BKs have grown dingy, indistinguishable from a bus station waiting room for patrons with no where really to go except here. On a Saturday night.   Oh, BK. Why? Why did you stop being a place of hopes and dreams for the youth, a place where you could rock teal mesh in any form. Was it switching from Pepsi? Introducing the 99 cent value menu? I came calling. White shirt. Skinny tie. You answered in sweat pants with socks and sandals.   And what did you do to your fries? Bleck!"}
{"text":"Great and upgraded establishment and facilities.glad Burger King is trying to up the anti since McDs started adding a contemporary feel to their establishment.  However, the current manager here is EXTREMELY RUDE. Treats \"his employees\" like poorly abused worker bees. After speaking to him kindly and nicely requesting service he got really rude and irate with me like I was some poor criminal trying to steal his hamburgers. I mean I can go to other local establishments to get good and better service but a small suggestion to this manager would be to provide better service and get an attitude check because with all the high competition of local businesses all they really have to show for is their service. Without it, they'd be nothing more than low quality food hidden behind a highly expensive yet worthless face lift."}
{"text":"Oh. Burger King (BK). How I've grown up with you. In high school we discovered the miracle of BK's \"perpetual pop\". They had moved the beverage works from behind the counter to the customer side. You could now operate the soda fountain yourself! It was like the elimination of the Latin mass in favor of plain English. Pay for one cup and we could sit in BK all Saturday afternoon drinking coke. You have to understand this was before Cott cola broke the price barrier and forced Coke and Pepsi to lower prices. Coke was a rare, rare treat.  Then came 1984. I had won a Reach for the Top Scholarship (my team came in second place in our regional finals). The scholarship turned out to be just cash that went right into my bank. And it went from my bank to Burger King over the course of a semester or two. How it sustained me.  And then came the Where's Herb campaign. One of Burger King's biggest and least successful ad campaigns was launched in 1985. For weeks via in-store ads, billboards, and television commercials, it teased its customers with the enigmatic \"Where's Herb?\" slogan. Eventually it clued its customers in to be on the look out for someone named Herb. If you spotted Herb, you would win $5,000. Alas, Burger King failed to tell its customers what Herb actually looked like. That was the other part of the gimmick, see. Keep 'em guessing. Create \"buzz\" by having people debate each other what Herb actually looks like.   None of that happened.  The net effect of asking its customers to find Herb -- but not telling anyone what Herb looked like -- was that Burger King caused its own customers to harass each other in its stores.  Mercifully for those who liked to enjoy their fast food in peace, Burger King finally revealed on Superbowl night Herb to be this geeky looking fellow in a too-tight, loud suit.  By this time, no one really cared.  Lost on the vast majority of fast food consumers was the message that Herb had never actually tried a Whopper, hence he was a geek, hence you were a geek too if you've not actually bit into one of Burger King's moist, juicy flame-broiled patties.  It was too much of a leap in logic for most burger consumers to grasp. Since the ads were telling customers that Herb was spending all his time in Burger Kings, what the fuck was he doing there if he wasn't eating burgers? Most assumed Burger King was trying to tell us Whoppers are the burger of choice by geeks everywhere.  Burger King blew $40 million on an ad campaign that only managed to drive off customers. The burger company's sales plummeted during the campaign. Advertising Age magazine labeled the \"Where's Herb?\" campaign the \"most elaborate advertising flop of the decade\". Other advertising insiders have more charitably called it \"simply one of the greatest fiascoes in the history of advertising.\"   Eventually I moved to Korea. A white man, such as I am, in McDonald's in Korea is a pernicious stereotype if there ever was one. But it seemed okay to be in Burger King. I could never figure out the economics of BK (or any burger place). If you went to the grocery store to buy ground beef, it would cost you more to make  a simple burger.   Upon returning to Canada, what with Harveys and Wendy's, BK was on the outs. I had my fill.   Then I heard about their new fries. I had to see. I just had to.  Oh BK. How could you."}

{"text":"I don't go here often because of bad experiences I've had with customers in the past but even when I did and parts of my extended family did it's been an up and down inconsistent service experience.  At times they do everything fine, other times the food treated like it say too long, the last visit they had no chicken strips which is ridiculous for a Burger King imo.  Basically going here means taking chances."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken fry combo. Came home and noticed there was only 3 fried in a box. Called a store, no answer. Never going back."}
{"text":"The reason they are so expensive is because this location is a franchise. It's always been on the high side in terms of prices. Food is kind of on the average ground, and while convenient for a location, they should realize their high prices won't help them whatsoever. Haven't gone to this location in years, but I'm not surprised they haven't lowered their prices."}

But this time was just ridiculous ordered our food at 4:05pm and got our Cup of coffee at 4:54pm 49min for a cup of coffee!!! Just ridiculous!

{"text":"These people are terrible with ordering through drive thru. They messed up my order and didn't give me the correct sandwiches and on top of that I was missing another sandwich. I had to drive all the way back to get it and still had to talk to 3 different people just to get my correct order fixed. I probably won't come back to this location. It's too bad because we order a lot for the office on a weekly basis and just lost a regular business customer."}

The funny thing was.. the lady at the second window who gave me my food even asked me if i wanted sauce for my chicken fries.. and i get home and it's not even in the bag.. I assumed that it's in there especially if they are asking you if you want any sauce.. well me assuming that they could do their job correctly was incorrect... I just don't know how difficult their jobs could be.. so i called.. the manager was nice enough to put my name down so next time when I come back.. I would get free chicken fries (it's not free.. I've already paid for it and they forgot to put it with my order). So I'm on my way back to work.. so i stopped back to get the chicken fries so my co worker would have something to eat for lunch.. and i went through the drive thru again.. no cars in front of me or next to me or behind me.. I had to say hello hello hello for someone to say something.. I'm just so confused to how difficult it is to have any customer service.. and if its not a job they dont want to do.. they shouldn't be there.."}

The food was awesome (5/5) and the workers were very friendly and actually smiled (5/5).  Restuarant itself was clean and each table had a nice rose on it (5/5).  Great instance of the chain!!"}
{"text":"Well it's a good thing that I only eat here 2-3 times a year! How do you mess up a kids hamburger? Just ask Burger King! The top part of the bun was nearly as hard as a rock. And they messed up the customer's order in front of me and the manager or person in charge started to argue with the poor guy. Now that's great customer service! NOT. The only people that I see in this location are older people from Sun City that most likely have lost their gustatory sense. Skip BK totally!"}

I've worked in the area for almost 5 years and gone to this place 2 times. Now I remember why. I''ll avoid this stop like the plague from now on. At least until the staff is entirely replaced or retrained. Rude, disengaged, curt, and bitter. To the customers and very obviously to each other too. Most unimpressive cashiers ever. Some of the worst customer service in Charlotte NC. Period."}

Awesome!"}

There's a completely new renovated McDonald's directly across the street from them. I recommend you try there.  If you want to feel belittled by a hoodrat go there and try your luck. I hope they lose their franchise licensing"}
{"text":"I typically like Burger King and decided to try the new one downtown. never again. service was blah...food wasn't good. onion rings were hard and whopper was not as good as normally have had at Burger King. I tried to get a straw and one of the workers was leaning up against the counter on his phone...and did not move when I was reaching for the straw."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru with 2 cars ahead of me and waited 15 minutes for a large fry. Outrageous. 9:45 am, not even a prime time."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru sat there for about 5 minutes no response asked if there was anybody there no response drove around looked in the window they were all just standing around horrible."}
{"text":"This location is not new, but the building is so thought I would check it out and grab something quick for breakfast. Very clean as you would expect with something that is only two weeks old. The food is the standard BK food and taste just like any other.  I would recommend this location if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"So after that tragedy of a burger I had earlier from Carl's Jr., I felt a redemption could be made if I just ordered two cheeseburgers at BK.  How hard can it be to make two plain cheeseburgers?  So I waited, and waited, and waited, while other people were getting their chicken nuggets, Whopper Jr's, and Extra Long BBQ Cheeseburgers.  While all that was happening I was staring at their order board and saw my order was in red letters and was passing 5 minutes while all the others were in green letters and most were finished in under a minute.  For two plain cheeseburgers?  C'mon, now!!  Well I finally got my cheeseburgers and they definitely made up for that hot mess I had earlier from Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"I love me a whopper but I don't love me a Burger King franchise. It's so hard to find a Burger King that can do things right. The girl that took my order through the drive-through window misquoted my bill. No big deal, she was new, so I let that slide. They asked me to pull around to the front to wait for my food so I did. The girl was sweet, passed me my food and I hit the road to my next job. Opened up the bag and to my surprise I was shorted a patty. Well, that's definitely worth going back for but it's Friday at 4:30 PM, I have one more job to do and I really need to get back to the east side of town so I suffered. Is it just me or is Burger King purposely trying to mess up our meals, the last couple of visits have been just that. I know, 2 stars would be generous but the girl at the window was new and she was pleasant to deal with."}
{"text":"Today was an unimpressive day for BK. I was really feeling a whopper. Waited all day, starved myself until the timing/location was right. I've stopped at this location before for a mocha frappe and have always got good service & exactly what I wanted. Today however, it was a different story. Follow me back in time (bout an hour) with an empty stomach and hungry eyes........  Older gentleman at the counter greeted me and put the decision immediately in my hands with a friendly \"what can I get for you?\" Without skipping a beat, Double whopper with queso, hold the cat sauce (AKA ketchup) & dab a little extra mayo on that masterpiece. Since I'm starved but not willing to give up quality for quantity go ahead and enlarge my meal and replace those boring 1945 fries for some SATISFRIES wouldja! \"What to drink sir?\" Nothing made me happier than letting Mocha Frappe roll of the tip of my tongue & nothing blanketed my party like a snappy comeback from this older gentleman about the mix not being ready. Devastation! But, not all is lost. I attempted to trick my tastebuds into happiness by ordering the mocha iced coffee and I tried to keep my spirits high by remembering the very reason I stopped in here today. My infatuation for a whopper!   Well, about 10 minutes later (think they forgot about me, no honestly!) my meal was ready. I proudly marched back to the only clean table I could find and opened the white box of happiness to find a single patty of beef. Alone in a sea of salad. Tried a couple fries on the way up to the counter, and they were cold. The drive thru operator was quick to get the problem for me. That older gentleman quickly moved on scene to see what was shaking. I love older people because they have no filter. Quietly to the burger prepper guy he asks him \"what the hell is wrong with you?\" Now I'm not the the guy who's gonna complain about a little ass chew'n, especially since I come from a military background. Thats just an everyday thing in my book when you fall short at a simple task. Why do I bring it up then you say, because it was hilarious to hear this older gentlemen in action! I've got mad respect for this guy now and I'm certain if I get out of line he'll call 2 big guys from the back to help adjust my attitude, hahaha!  A couple minutes go by & the older gentleman brings out round 2. I duck, I weave and I cautiously open the little white box and POW! A double whopper with cheese, hold the ketchup & add sum mayo. Finally, I've gotten what I've been waiting for all day. Was it a home run, no more like an intentional walk but hey it's what I wanted so I dug in. Those satisfies on round 2-still cold. Well, I wasn't gonna cry wolf twice because the first time went so well. so I chalked it up as a loss. Iced coffee was pretty good tho.... tasted like chocolate milk-YUM! Just getting ready to leave and that older gentleman graced us with his presence from the shadows and offered us 2 complimentary breakfast sammiches for the inconvenience. A nice gesture for an unsatisfying meal.   Now that you & I have taken a trip down memory lane I leave you with this little JM fortune cookie. Never trust meal to be what you want when reviews from YELP say you better choose another idea......"}
{"text":"2 words: WHOPPER WEDNESDAY.  For 3.99, you get a huge honkin' Whopper (cheese, is extra, no big whoop), a medium fries & a medium drink.  What a deal - and I\"m tellin' you, this burger is huge. And if you're like me, this is 'bad for you' comfort food.  This is our Wednesday ritual: My boyfriend and I call each other at work to  remind each other it's 'Whopper Wednesday Night!'.  It's *that* exciting in my household!   The area is totally shady, and I'm not sure I'd ever do the 'walk-in' thing, but I feel safe enough in a car with my huge boyfriend."}
{"text":"Unless you are ready for being chastised for ordering breakfast, after you have to pull up to the drive-thru window because no one would take your order at the speaker where the wrong menu was displayed, don't fool yourself in thinking this is even a restaurant.   This beautiful Monday morning, a lady (who I thought was suppose to be the manager), who was taking my order, rudely instructed that I have to call ahead with a large order. There were't any other customers in line or in the restaurant. When I asked for her name, she covered her badge and stormed off. This encouraged another employee to be disrespectful, who looked like he just rolled out of bed with no uniform.   I asked if I needed to call ahead the last time I came through with the same order. They said no and were so fast that I didn't have to wait long, that time. It's why I went back today.   I have to give credit where it's due. The gentlemen who I assumed was a cook, immediately fixed the menu sign and tried to take my order. The district manager will be informed about him, as well as the other two employees."}
{"text":"I ordered a combo meal at lunch and opted for Onion Rings instead of Fries.   I paid for the order and left.  When I went to eat my order, the Onion Rings ere only partially filled - maybe 6 or 7 rings. ' They tasted OK, but not very satisfying at all.  Always remember to check your order after you leave to ensure that you get what you paid for! !! !!!"}
{"text":"As everyone in the world knows, BK is the best fast food place in merica. Bringing the chicken fries back was a great idea and they are very delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered kids meal, jr whopper, whopper & chicken club. We had to park? K? Food was fresh but I know what they were doing, they are trying to trick the timer and speed of service. We were the ONLY car. Annoying."}
{"text":"Can only hope that the \"remodel\" will bring about a better experience. Food at this location is always terrible and the place is always filthy."}
{"text":"Horrible! I went through the drive thru. The person taking my order was prompt and when I got to the window he took my money quickly and gave me the straw and my drink. It took 10 minutes to get one small Whopper jr. I could see from the window that people inside the restaurant were getting their food. I also heard someone yelling hurry up, hurry up in Spanish to someone and telling them that you're fired after this and then laughing. I sure hope this gets red and that management is aware of the unprofessional behavior that happened to me at least."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying that I do understand that Burger King is considered fast food, but I was heading through the LV airport on the way home and decided to grab a quick breakfast sandwich.  I was promptly greeted and placed my order for a muffin breakfast sandwich with just egg and cheese and received it within 3 minutes.  Once I got to the gate, I sat down and took a bite.  What I was presented with was a bite of pure grease, which overpowered the egg flavor.  I guess this is what I get for grabbing something quick."}
{"text":"This location is Open and recently underwent a complete remodel. Seems the new remodel has made some serious changes to production. Every vehicle in the drive through was asked to pull up and park after paying for their food, we waited 10 minutes for our drive thru order. When they finally brought it out the they brought out all three vehicles orders at the same time, and of course, our order was missing items but I was to frustrated to go in and correct it. Why would you make all the customers in the drive thru pull up and park only to wait for everyone's order to be ready to bring them out? This place needs a complete remodel of the business plan and employee training if they place to recoup there investment anytime soon. We also miss the old staff, they where friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I love the BK Fish Sandwich, Fries and a small Coke, and I have ordered it from many different BKs over the years. And while there has usually be some variation, overall, the sandwich has usually been very good. However, this BK was one of the times where I had a very different out come.   The sandwich had pickles on it (while I like pickles, I don't remember having them on the sandwich in the past since the tarter sauce has pickles in it already; so I removed them) and, like the fries, they were slightly above a warm temperature.   However, the filet looked a bit darker than normal, but the sandwich tasted rancid, like the oil hadn't been changed in a while.   So, I doubt if I'll stop by this BK again. But, if I do, I'll order something else."}
{"text":"This might be the best Burger King I've ever eaten at. I don't tend to like them. But this place is good"}
{"text":"I like it here. It's a nice, open restaurant, clean bathrooms, and the food was cooked well and as I ordered. What else can you ask for in a fast food place?"}
{"text":"Food came out quick and fast and good! Satisfied with overall experience. If your hungry it's a good place to go for quick food"}
{"text":"Good location, one drive thru and not kind to larger pick-up's. This BK I have to walk into to order which I do not like."}
{"text":"Very good and quick service employees came to ask if everything was ok never have I had that thanks"}
{"text":"False advertising here. I downloaded their app and was offered a variety of coupons, just like their brown bags say. However, at this location they decide what the coupon value will be, not their app. I ask the guy why the price difference, and he just says \"Not here!!\". That's fine I will do the McDonald's app from now on, since the price is the same regardless of the store. My burgers were cold, which wasn't surprising since they had the order done so fast. Poor quality food, poor customer service, and the not so busy store was dirty. Like the super sticky drink station. For a new location, they should be winning customers, not pushing them away. I'll for sure pass this one by going forward."}
{"text":"I had been given a Burger king gift card and since i hadnt been to one on over a year, i decided to go on the way home from work. No issues ordering. The fries were bland with no salt but still crunchy. The burger itself was average. The meat didnt taste like meat. It was weird. While i was eating it, i thought to myself \"should have just made a burger here at home\" at least it would have had flavor.   The reason i gave 2 stars is basically the soda and no hassle of getting my food. I use to love burger king back when i was in Cali. But i guess my love for BK is done.....ill stick to Carls Jr."}
{"text":"Went to Burger King try to get some cheese fries they were not cheesy they were cold tasted like there were three days old got me a Sunday told me it was extra for chocolate and Lady was rude at the drive-through I mean we all have bad days but it wasn't mine"}
{"text":"EVERY table was dirty. EVERY SINGLE ONE. Yea, homeless people are wandering about. Food was 'normal' and the cashier was friendly.   If you're really hungry and ask them to clean your table, you could eat here. That is all."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 burger fries and drinks through the drive thru. Took about twenty minutes to get my food which i wouldn't mind but when I got home half way through the meal i realized the burger was red in the center also my kids burgers were red as well. Threw it away and threw up on top of it. Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"I only go here because I only get a 30 min. Lunch break and it's close by. But they ALWAYS get my order wrong. Once I ordered 2 whopper meals for my coworker and i and when I got back to the office, our whoppers had no lettuce,tomatoes,pickles,etc, NOTHING but the floppy patty and a soggy bun. I was so embarrassed. And today, I ordered fries and onion rings with NO SALT. No salt due to a religious observant., when I get back to the office in a rush. My fries and onion rings are covered in salt. How hard is it to work at burger King and they want 15.00 an hour. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ,DON'T GO HERE."}
{"text":"I know it's fast food but these folks need some training on customer service.  The cashier was actually complaining to customers about how much of a bad mood he was in because his boss didn't let him go home when he wanted.  He should be counseled on maintaining professionalism regardless of circumstance before your store loses more customers.    I don't come here a lot and now I remember why."}
{"text":"First and only time I'll ever go to this location. The guy at the window was straight up tweaking! I'm talking legit meth head, paranoid schizo status, scratching left and right and extremely jittery. I'm surprised he even managed to get my drinks out the window into my hand without spilling them! Yikes...    Say no to meth and Burger King for that matter, kids."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Burger King for the past few years and they get my order wrong a lot.  I don't eat cheese, and I can't even count how many times my sandwich has had cheese on it.  The good thing is that they always replace it when I call them and explain.  The bad thing is, I really just wanted my food right the first time.  When you are hungry and on the go, it's nice to get what you were expecting.  It's such an inconvenience to deal with this, I rarely go to this location anymore.  If I have time, I will go inside and that usually works out better than going in the drive-thru."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I LOVE Burger King! But this particular location isn't the best. I don't know if it's cause I go through drive thru, but they always get my order wrong and their drive thru is never busy!!!   I gave in a fairly normal sized order and the person who took the order seemed to understand with no problems. I had asked for onions rings instead of fries in which I got fries. I has also asked for the zesty sauce and they failed to put that in. Completely dissatisfied and this happened to me twice!! I would have complained if I didn't go through drive thru cause I checked when I got home!   STAFF: Always seem to be in a rush with taking the order and giving the food even when there isn't a line up. They are friendly and nice but could be quick yet also efficient.   FOOD: Great, but never has enough sauce on my burgers even when I ask with extra sauce."}
{"text":"I ordered two ten piece chicken nuggets and a small order of fries. When she read the order back she got it back wards........but that's not why I'm leaving this review. When I paid, I paid with my debit card. She gave me back a card wrapped in the receipt. When I unwrapped it it was not my debit card it was a BK card, when I called her on it she said oh I'm sorry I gave you back the wrong card. Beware."}
{"text":"Ordered the A1 bacon cheese burger. So not worth it! It was average and of course it looked like the picture just smaller and smashed. Not worth paying 8 dollars for."}
{"text":"They started to give us attitude once we said it was two orders and they were unbelievably RUDE with the amount of sauce they give. I'm pretty sure it was the person in charge that was being the rude one too."}
{"text":"I'm waiting in line.  It's so backed up I'm sitting half on the main road !   Awesome"}
{"text":"I drove thru and bought a sunday and it wasn't even ice cream.I will never go to a burger King again, it was so discussing. There hamburgers are kept in water and just taste terrible .Quit trying to save money by serving bad food."}
{"text":"Fair warning, you're a gonna do some waitin'.  Food quality sure seems to be on the up tick since the remodel. But wow the wait times have become long. Do not be surprised if you are asked to pull around the front of the store while your drive-through order is prepared. I'm writing this following the second occurrence, within a week, of greater than 10 minutes of waiting on drive-through orders. We tend to hit this BK following visits to Cosmo Dog Park. New dog Dasher gets a plain burger after K9 social hour.  Anyway, I'm not really certain what's driving the wait times. The customer service is very pleasant. The wait is just long. Maybe there's a lot of turnover in personnel or frequent short staffing. But there seems to be a pattern. Last night our wait was about 13 minutes. And that's after I thought to run the stop watch on my phone.  There were 5 other cars waiting around front. The poor manager was walking from car to car asking names and whether the order was right for the car he'd walked to. It was bad. Felt for him.  But, if you're cool with a bit of a wait, the quality does seem better these days.  Good luck BK, Dale"}
{"text":"Had a late flight out of Phoenix and was hungry, so I grabbed a quick bite here.  Ordered a Whopper Jr & a BK Double Stacker. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tHaySMUc5u2a_71vfZG-0A?select=Wro1kGuK8MBgJzBUblMFUA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tHaySMUc5u2a_71vfZG-0A?select=KzXGNWDAtP6W4f8Ezty3Fg  The Burgers came out hot, but they were very average.  They lacked any real flavor.  I don't know why I eat a joints like this anymore.....will have to try and break that habit.  Return Factor - 3%"}
{"text":"Having a 14 year old Son means a lot of trips to Fast Food joints and this one is in our neighborhood.  This one is not one of our favorite joints.  The food quality here is sub-par....even by fast food standards.  The Beef never tastes fresh and the Bread seems a little old at times.  We decided we wouldn't eat here anymore because it's that bad.  There are 1000's of other fast food joints to choose from."}
{"text":"Late night out, needed some post-bar help, ordered 2 Double Stackers in the drive thru......quick and accurate order.  That's all I ask for from a fast food joint.  The Burgers were just OK, it's Burger King for crying out loud.  Return Factor - 60%"}
{"text":"There are two Burger King's that I generally visit when I'm at the Airport in Vegas.....one in the C Gates area and the other is in the A/B Gate area.  This review is for both of them......  They're always busy, so it's not always guaranteed that you can \"grab n go\" with the food.  The seating area in the C Gate area can also get very busy.....the seating at the other location is usually open because the customers at the A/B Gate location usually get their food and go to their gate since it's at a fork between the 2 gate areas and there's still a 2-3 minute walk to the actual gate.  Keep that in mind if you're planning to grab a bite before your flight.  The food is.....well, it's fast food and doesn't taste any different than the locations outside of the airport, just realize the cost is 50% higher.  The service level is decent, not great.  Overall, it's a solid place to grab a quick bite and deserves the 3 Star rating in my book.  Return Factor - 70%"}
{"text":"Place is clean cousin services great got my food. When I took a bite out of my burger wasn't even hot and it tasted too salty."}
{"text":"I don't know about other people's experiences, but every time I've visited this location the staff has been friendly, professional and helpful. Even when I've had expired coupons they've never given me a hard time about it and the service is quick, food fresh and they have specials clearly marked and they look as though they're enjoying themselves.   This is a food court chain restaurant, but for me that gives them a chance to stand out if they go above and beyond and I feel they do.  It's Burger King, so I can't say 'try this or this!' because if you're going there...then you've already been before, but this one is really good!"}
{"text":"This place is always clean order is always on point service is great!!!  Just wish the play house was open later than 8:30PM..."}
{"text":"I went to this location at about 9:30 at night. It was one of those double drive thru's and I pulled in the first one, noticing that there was a red mustang in the next order menu, waiting to order. After a full minute (literally, not exaggerrating) I finally said \"Hello?\" A lady replied \"I'll be right with you.\" I noticed the red car guy still at the next menu board. I waited for five minutes, still, no one took my order.  My patience were gone and I left to the McDonalds two miles down the road. On my way home, from my ten min. trip to McDs. I passed Burger King and spotted the red car guy still waiting to order. This was crazy. They didn't offer and explanation or apology,  just silence.   Despite this occasion, previous trips to this location always rendered me unhappy, and this time I decided I'm not ever going back to that location."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great, but it's cheap and works in a pinch.  Of course there are the upfront price you pay for at the counter and then the back home price you pay for eating it =\  So there's all these optional questions to fill out along with the written interview saying things like, \"Good for this\" and \"Good for that,\" well it's really not good for anything except filling you up with stuff that resembles food while you're on a budget.  If you can avoid it, do so.  Today just happened to be one of those unavoidable days for me."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I had a breakfast sandwich, and half of the croissant was hard and the sandwich was cold. The drink station was a mess, liquid all over the floor in the front of the drink station, is nobody picking it up at mopping. No catchup in the catchup pumps. Horrible experience altogether. I do not suggest going here to eat"}
{"text":"Gonna name names--Dallas needs to be retrained. He rarely speaks, just holds his hand out the window. No thanks, no have a good day, no kiss my a**, nothing. Permanent scowl on his face. Hair always looks dirty. Yuck."}
{"text":"Third time's a charm right? Well I've given this BK a ton of chances, but no more. My last three visits have ended up leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Cold food, missing items, and bad attitudes is what I've now come to expect from my visits here. The old \"Have It Your Way\" slogan no longer applies here. No tomatoes? Extra pickles? Slice of cheese? Add bacon? Sure as hell they'll charge you for it, but what you get in return is a sloppy mess made up by an even sloppier staff."}
{"text":"Had parked the car in front of me, parked me. This took forever. I spent 4 bucks and waited fifteen minutes. Got an expired coupon for waiting. Thanks."}
{"text":"Burger King has finished its' remodel...and it appears to have gone high-tech.  The big display menu boards are easy to read, and the building looks to be refreshed both inside and out.  The food...it's Burger King, folks...fast and moderately priced, intended to be consumed with a carbonated beverage, and don't forget fries with that.  My experiences both pre- and post-remodel are the same.  If you are going to custom-order your food, you are better served to park the car and walk in.  Placing a custom order at the drive through, like most fast-food restaurants, is an exercise in futility.  Most who custom order do not check their order when it comes to 'em in a bag until they get to their destination...and that generally means no turning around to get the order corrected.  I have not had any significantly negative experiences here."}
{"text":"When I went to this Burger King, they weren't all that busy, but then again it was like in the evening when I went. No one was in line and I didn't have to wait long for someone to take my order. The service was fast, I enjoyed my meal, and I got to stay for a little while for what was like an hour. Since I sat down in the restaurant and ate my food, I also got free refills for my drink, and I love their new frozen drinks!"}
{"text":"This is one of our family's favorite Tuesday night value menu splurges. Tonight, however, the experience was HORRIFIC!  There were a pair of young women vaping, clouds of vape, in the restaurant... and instead of addressing it, the employees either ignored it or socialized with the girls. When I came to the counter, I was told \"I know, they've been here a long time, maybe they'll be done soon.\"  MANAGEMENT: Please have employees keep the dining facility a clean healthy enjoyable place to eat!"}
{"text":"As far as my expectations for a fast food burger place go, this location isn't that bad. I needed a place to let the kids let out some energy so the playground was it.  I was pretty happy with the cleanliness of the playground and there is a hand sanitizer dispenser right by the playground door. This, I appreciate.  It's a burger king, so really if it isn't a filthy mess it's pretty difficult to call it a disappointment unless something is really wrong. They got my order right (ordering for myself and 4 kids so it wasn't a simple one).  I am curious though when burger king's prices began to creep up. Their marketing and decor seems to be trying to send me a message that they're a casual restaurant now instead of fast food. I appreciate the effort to elevate their image, but the food doesn't reflect that yet so let's put the whopper somewhere further below 4 bucks again, please? (I remember when they were a buck.)  But, yeah, I can imagine that most fast food places only get reviewed when a customer is upset. I don't think this location deserves such a bad rap."}
{"text":"Two times now I've been to this location and they were not participating in advertised specials, and frankly I am just tired of it.  It would be nice if the corporate franchise would make franchisees post clearly if they are not participating in wide-range advertisements, but I've learned my lesson about this location. I won't be stuck in their drive through trying to get dinner for my kids again.  I recommend any of the other locations in the area, I have never had this kind of difficulty anywhere else."}
{"text":"I have never been to any burger king (or any other major fast food chain) like this- and that is not a compliment. Tonight was my 3rd time coming here, and there's been a problem every single time! Where can i even start? They are the only BK I've EVER heard of that does not honor BURGER KING coupons! Then, even knowing this,  I was crazy enough to try this location again. At the time of this writing, its being widely advertised that 10 pc nuggets are 1.50$, so imagine my surprise when my total came to almost 9$ for two orders that should have been less than 4$!! Some manager suddenly and rudely interjected when I asked why it was so overpriced, saying this location does not do promos or sales prices! So in addition to not accepting coupons any other location would honor, they also do not participate in any kind of sales AND they actually have almost every item on their menu raised by about a dollar or more. We said cancel our order and pulled out, went to the one two miles down (on thunderbird) and paid only 3.50$ for the exact order they were trying to charge us 9$ for! Oh, and what everyone else says about how long they take is also true! On multiple occasions, we have waited 10-20 minutes, even when no one else was in the drive thru and only ordered one item some of those times! It doesnt matter if they are busy or empty, you order a lot of things or one thing- expect to wait! I am going to contact the owner (hope they see this review!) and tell them how penny wise and pound foolish they are- dont they know sales and coupons is a tried and true, proven marketing tactic that drives sales?! HELLO?!!! Avoid this location, go to any of the ones in surrounding areas and pay about half the price for the exact same meal!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. The quality of the food seems to be going down, fast. The service is ok, but definitely not great. The wait for food in the drive through is pretty bad, for fast food drive thru. Won't be going here very often. Too bad, cause I used to like their breakfast."}
{"text":"Not too happy.  The server was friendly, but took my order wrong.  Ended up with a few wrong items.  It was already paid for and on the tray before we figured it out, so we just said whatever.  The cheeseburger (which we did not order) was cold and not so good, even for BK.  The onion rings were also not so hot.  The whole experience kind of reminded me why I don't go to BK anymore."}
{"text":"McDonalds is somehow WAY better than Burger King. I ordered a whopper and the thing instantly started falling apart as I tried to eat it. Got halfway through before I decided the mess and taste wasn't worth it, and just threw it out. The fries are too thick for my liking, ate a couple of those and also let the trash enjoy the rest. Ordered Diet Coke and all I could taste was carbonation with some syrup in it, didn't even taste like soda. This place is a dump."}
{"text":"They don't even have the king hats out. ? Only reason why I came for lunch.   Otherwise why would anyone come to Burger King?"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken sandwich lettuce was moldy and wilted. I don't know if chicken had been under headlamp all day or if it was just extremely overlooked.  The fries were also stale.  Service was slow!!!"}
{"text":"This review is based totally on one thing and one thing only. OK. Maybe two things. When you go to Burger King, you know what's coming. I got a Whopper combo. And decided to give the new Chicken Parm a shot. I don't know what they are trying to pass off as marinara, but its not even close to being good. Now for the next complaint. The lady at the window asked if I needed ketchup. Good job on that. Usually you aren't even asked if you want it. My response was yes. A LOT OF KETCHUP, please! So how many do I get? Four. Four! You have to be kidding me! For a Whopper and an order of fries? Tsk tsk tsk."}
{"text":"Came here to get some nuggets for my kids before their flight. BK right now is advertising 10 nuggets for $1.49. I know that would not be the price in the airport. I was expecting a mark up, but almost had a heart attack when I saw it. I joked around with my boys that watch it be like $5 an order. I was stunned when I saw the menu board said $5.99! So with tax 2 orders came to $12.95! On top of that, I had to beg for two things of dipping sauce. They weren't going to give me any when it's BK policy to give two per 10 order, and got an attitude to go with it. I know when you're stuck at an airport, there isn't much you can do, but try to stay away from here. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great little stop to pick up some breakfast before heading to our flight....the food was hot and cooked to order....love the little hash brown minis....also changed my coffee to a diet soda so I could take it on the plane. The service was given with a smile"}
{"text":"I've had good service here before but the ice machine had some kind of mold or green junk spilling out of the ice dispenser"}
{"text":"Visited this Burger King store around 845am Tuesday morning. The drive thru line wasn't long surprisingly, being around breakfast rush. We ordered 3 breakfast meal combos that come with hashbrowns and drinks. Unfortunately they forgot our hashbrown sides and we weren't going to turn back around.   The service is fast but you might not get all of your food. I suggest to double check while at the window at this location to risk having to come back for missed items."}
{"text":"The food is good and the lady at the register for the lunch crowd is delightful.   BUT THE MUSIC IS ATROCIOUS !     Sounds like a Black lady screaming at the top of her lungs behind a bad loud band.   Seems management, if they are going to have music, would want something pleasant to complement the BK dining experience."}
{"text":"Slow drive thru (waited at window for 20 minutes)  Ordered a whopper and two double cheeseburgers and a few other items. They didn't even make the whopper ($5 down the drain) and the double cheeseburgers were single ($4 more down the drain). Always fun to find out after driving home.   Too lazy to go back and get what I ordered in the first place so here is your generous 1 star review.   What can I really expect... it's a Burger King. Probably a sign that I should stop eating this trash in general anyways. Thanks for the motivation guys!"}
{"text":"This Burger King shows that it opens at 6am.  I have been there 3 times over the last two weeks past 6:10am and they still were not open.  I called the corp office to advise."}
{"text":"Besides missing my daughters kids meal , to open my salad and find this gross knotted hair! Gag!! Never again!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest fast food restaurant I've been to in recent memory.   it took 15 minutes to get a simple hamburger and fries.   My recommendation : get it together guys, it's a hamburger and fries."}
{"text":"We just stopped in to try the new fiery chicken fries but ended up really impressed with the service and the quality of food and the cleanest of the restaurant. My daughter thought the fiery chicken fries would be too hot for her now but ended up liking him more than the original ones. Once again the experience was great for a Burger King."}
{"text":"Okay, so i ordered at the drive thru there were no cars in front or behind me and parking lot wasn't full. I pulled up to the window, paid, received my drink and asked if i can have some ketchup.. mind you i have a large meal! He pulls out the ketchup and is just staring at it.. then hands me TWO ketchup packets with a side of eyeball rolling WITH syrup all over it! So that is obviously what he was staring at.. I get my food and ask for a little bit more ketchup as two packets is not enough for a large fry.. He then rolls his eyes and sighs.. I get home and all the ketchup packets were stuck together is one big ball... Never coming back here for the rude staff(also in the background) and was not clean. ewwwwwww"}
{"text":"Stopped here a few times for a late dinner.  Always satisfied with the service and food."}
{"text":"This is the most conveniently located Burger King to where I live. It's right next to the Lowe's plaza where I frequently go to shop for needed household items.  After stopping at Lowe's, this is a good place to pick up a quick bite to eat - currently the two for $6.00 special (chicken sandwich or Whopper) is a worthwhile option.  This Burger King used to have extremely slow and truly poor service not too long ago. However, my diligently filling out and complaining when submitting the provided online customer surveys at checkout appears to have worked wonders. Service is now first rate!  Regarding the question of which do you prefer - Burger King or McDonald's - I am much more a Whopper than a Big Mac person. I really can't remember the last time that I went to Mickey D's. It's been years baby."}
{"text":"Whiplash Whopper is a Whopper with extra onions.  I discovered the Iron Man 2 hype by ordering a Whiplash Whopper because I wanted the bold flavor.  It was extra onions.  I paid an extra 80 or so cents for something I could have had free if I ordered the Whopper.  Anyhow, I finished the burger in front of my gate seconds before boarding.   On a plus, the manager noticed the wave of hungry people and went down the line and took the customer's orders."}
{"text":"I don't go here often. Occasionally, I get a craving to go there, and am quickly reminded why. The crew is slow, surly, and rude. They frequently mess up my order, and the dining room is often an outright MESS!"}
{"text":"Order a double got a single I ask for no onions and there was onions and please tell me that this Burger King going to be fix"}
{"text":"Second try here and besides the nice person in driver through that's the only going for this place. Brand new and not holding up to the Burger King I grew up with. Regular and chicken fries tasted like oil was at the end of its usage. Spicy chicken sandwich was small, had sad tomato, and little to no lettuce at all."}
{"text":"Drive thru girl tonight was horrible had attitude and was rude. Food is good and they have good deals but the main thing is she was not happy to help us. Get another job if you don't like it  My boyfriend ask for ketchup and she said its in the bag and closed the window with attitude. My boyfriend waited at the window and when she open the window asked for more she wasn't happy we didn't even want to ask for anything else. Then we got home and they forgot straws no wonder they have one star the food is good that's the ONLY reason I'm giving 2 stars but guys have to really work on your customer service"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible customer service.  I didnt even want to continue to order. She wouldn't even listen to my question without assuming the answer. Sheesh and I'm not even that crazy about customet service  but definitely left a bad taste in my mouth about this location."}
{"text":"Honestly horrible service and my burger was a mess, the cashier basically showed he didn't care for anything and took his sweet time with everything. After my order was called, i asked him for buffalo sauce and he proceeded to take a while on a drink for a drive thru customer but he also was chatting it up with one of his buddies on the headset. So after waiting some time to get the sauce, finally sat down and me and my friends burgers looked liked everything was thrown on top while the cook was blindfolded. Probably the only Burger King I felt was really sh*tty."}
{"text":"By far the worst restaurant in the airport. The majority of the food service places at CLT are pretty good, if not very good. This one is terrible. Food is poorly made, employees are rude, and service is slow. It is almost like they are not expecting to be busy, but everyday they are busy. One person working the front counter taking orders and serving food. No idea how many are in the kitchen, but it is certainly not enough."}
{"text":"This BK is right near my house. I've been inside once and the establishment was well-kept. The drive-thru can be a bit slow but my food order is almost always accurate (I got a coke instead of tea once). Overall, the staff is always super friendly and I very rarely run into any issues with my order."}
{"text":"So I don't usually complain about fast food, but place is filthy, ice machine and soda machine down, have the ice tea pitches, cucustomer service was slow and messed up our orders. Bathroom had flies in it. Worst fast food I have ever had. Not only that but got food poisoning from it. Never again"}
{"text":"I love Burger King out of all fast good restaurants.  I always order the whopper, because of the charbroiled way they cook hamburgers.  My favorite drink used to be the lemonade icee, but now it's discontinued!!!  The spicy chicken sandwich is horrible with that special sauce they make.  Service is what it is for fast food."}
{"text":"This is not good even by Burger King standards.  Quick lines and fast service, but the food isn't good.  $14.50 for a combo meal!  I thought the crispy chicken advertised on the billboard looked good, but it is basically a slightly larger version of the $1 chicken sandwich on the menu at local locations. They do get 2 stars since you can refill your Coke there as much as you'd like.  But then you may run into an issue on your flight - so buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Dear Burger King, I have given you a try 3 separate times now, over the course of several months, because you are on my way home from work and sometimes I am hungry and make poor choices. I'm really not trying to be rude here, but after a seriously messed up order on all 3 occasions I am afraid we have to call it quits. Order 1: 2 BK Veggie burgers with cheese. What I got? 2 BK Fish. Let's try again. Order 2: 2 BK Veggie burgers with cheese. What I got? 1 BK Veggie, no cheese, 1 BK fish. Let's do this one more time. Order 3: 2 BK Veggie burgers with cheese. What I got? 2 cheeseburgers. I'm so over you."}
{"text":"On 1-22-08  I have been eating at Burger King almost my entire life!  I am really disappointed at many levels.  1.  The kitchen and food prep area was a filthy floor, food all over the floor and it as well as a serious safety hazard to the staff, and very unappealing to the customer as they stand at the order area at the front counter.  2.  When I approached Burger king at 9:10 pm it looked like it was closed because chairs were up on the tables.  This was 50 minutes before the dining in area was closed.  Yes, he \"Sam, asst. Manager\" had the excuse that she was cleaning, but the chairs never came down!  3.  I ordered my food and the chairs remained up on the table giving me a bad experience in the dining area because of the closeness of the tables.  4.  I went to get my drink and the ketchup dispenser was broke and no ketchup packs given to me, \"no sign stating that the dispenser was broke\" and when I got my food, I had to go back to the front counter and ask for ketchup because no ketchup packs where at the broken ketchup dispenser.  True inconvenience!   5.  I asked to the asst manager to have the District manager \"Chad King\" to call me, and to this day no call. 2-6-18  Very Disappointed at many levels, suggestion, eat some where else."}
{"text":"Worst burger king ever. Waited in line 10 minutes to be ignored really??. Once the associate finished with the person in front of me, she walked away and never came back to take our order. Management seriously needs work on their employees."}
{"text":"This is a terrible Burger King location. The drive-thru service is extremely slow and the staff may still have you park in the front to wait some more for your order. Last visit my order was wrong in almost every way. Received the wrong beverage, wrong side, and the burger was a mess."}
{"text":"So I'm starting my review while I wait in line for a fast food restaurant. You would think that if you have a line of more than a dozen customers you would open up more than 1 cash register. It only took 15 minutes and another dozen to show up before they decide to open up the 2nd register. Not to mention a homeless women decides to cut through the whole line and the staff seemed to be fine that it happened. The staff were unable to handle the situation as the homeless women decided to be messing around in the condiments area. Management was kinda unprofessional on how she was speaking to the homeless women. The nuggets that I ordered were kinda dry and small. I was not too impressed. Although they did have all selections of dipping sauces that another Burger King did not have as they were running out. Only thing that kept me coming back was the 10 nuggets for $1.79 deal. Jimstar Out!"}
{"text":"One star is too much! 3 people in line and it took 20 mins. The manager was polishing the sauce cups the entire time. Once the food came out I got a bag full of disappointment. I would have had it remade if it wouldn't take so long and I didn't have a flight. I posted some photos. The order was not made correctly, no cheese on the whopper with cheese, the fries were cold and soggy, and the chicken strips were most likely picked up from the floor. This has been the worst fast food experience of my life.  I contacted customer service online and they are sending me a coupon for a free whopper in 2-3 weeks. I think I'll pass. This was a complete fail by their store and their corporate office.  Bk I'm leaving you!"}
{"text":"I'd recommend this Burger King as simply put OK! Though the décor/atmosphere is extremely dated and a bit grungy, the food served is always fresh and quick. Staff friendliness is average. Would I come back? Yes."}
{"text":"Just a follow up in case anyone from burger king or their corp office reads these reviews.  I was suppose to be contacted by a rep for BK & it has been over a month & no contact.  Just to let you know I have not visited any BK's since nor do I plan to as your customer service is down right PATHETIC"}
{"text":"Service in the drive-thru was fast, but apparently these workers all speak limited English and cannot get the order right.  I asked for a 2-pc cinnabon meal. I got and paid for a 1-pc meal. Didnt notice until after we drove away,  because it was in a box and who pulls their stuff out while they are driving?"}
{"text":"They have new people with better attitudes. They now have cinnabons, a new interactive playplace for kids of all ages, and a new pop machine similar to the one at Firehouse subs. Keep it up, BK; great positive changes! This location is in the Frys plaza corner of Ray and Dobson in Chandler"}
{"text":"This Burger King is the nicest Burger King I have been too. The employees are very nice and the restaurant itself is very amazing. I honestly come here a lot when I am craving a midnight snack or want to splurge on some junk food. This Burger King is very yummy and I could recommend anyone to come here. Love the seating and the environment."}
{"text":"So I came in here to get the 5 for $4 deal for myself and my grandson. The burgers once again had the cheese on the bottom and the buns toasted all to hell! The manager came around and asked how the bacon cheeseburgers were. I asked why the cheese was on the bottom and was told this was his idea! He said he has the employees do that because the cheese won't melt everywhere like when its put on top..HUH??? I showed him my burger where about an inch of the cheese was hanging off the side, and he then says he has them put the cheese on the bread first so they don't forget it, lol! I let him know that is not the way to build a burger and he said he disagrees. I also let him know that his buns are coming out way too brown, I was informed I am wrong and they are coming as they should. NO CHEESE ON THE BOTTOM, STOP THIS MADNESS."}
{"text":"One of the only real fast food restaurant in this terminal. The food is fast food, so it is o.k. tasting. Great for the on the go traveler that needs something quick. Lots of fat calories that leaves one somewhat regretting the consumption choice afterwards. Really don't like how the area is set up because the traffic just doesn't seem to flow correctly. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Today's experience was the SECOND time that I have ordered food at this location, paid for it, and had something missing from the bag.  In today's case, it was my son's food, and we didn't notice until we were at a park for a picnic.  How do you tell a 5yo that everyone else's food is there, but his is not?  I also noticed today, that their health score is not that high (I don't remember the exact number) but we were driving through and hitting the park as a treat, and the kids were set on BK.  There are SO many other places to pick up food within a mile of this place that I don't think they will be getting a 3rd chance anytime soon."}
{"text":"Menu says chicken fries are $2.89. Got to the window and asked why the price was higher, he said it is the wrong price on the menu and no one has bothered to change it. WOW lazy much? Also that is false advertising. I only took them because I was in the line for so long."}
{"text":"Chicken Fries sucked big time and didn't give us ordered condiments as well as flat sodas"}
{"text":"Wow they don't know the word \" FRESH\"  went through drive thru and received old cold hard onion rings cold burger and old cold chicken sandwich!! Flipped around and went back to drive thru and gave it back n got our money back! Seems like they don't care and have been going down the drain! Save your money and go else where to spend your hard earned money!!"}
{"text":"This is the SLOWEST BK I have EVER been to! I take my breaks there once in a while but the wait is sooo long I always have to eat on the run! I ordered the new \"Turkey Burger\" and it was HORRIBLE!! Both my boyfriend and myself ordered them and BOTH of us about got sick with the smell! After taking one discusting bite (to give it a chance) we immediately told the manager it was awful. He told us they had not tried it....but never offered to exchange it! We needed to eat so we each got a chicken sandwich but we had to PAY FOR IT! I believe it should have been offered to us atleast with a discount! (we paid 3.99 for each turkey burger!). We left the turkey burgers on the counter and they threw them out, but we left discusted. I took the survey offered and told of our experience. I also wrote customer relations of BK but didn't even get a response.  I will never go back to this BK and warn all of you .... there are plenty of other BK's around the area where I am SURE they would offer you a cheeseburger if your food was unedible!!! The staff and managers are who make the \"chain stores\" so I will now visit the Elliott and Kyrene or Ray and Dobson store where you are treated like the \"Queen\" to BK's \"King\"!!! LOL! :)"}
{"text":"Worst Burger King I've ever been to. Severely understaffed, the food taste like it's been sitting there was a line inside and a line in the drive-through with nobody being served. I was headed my food and the employee just ran away and wouldn't even stay to see what else I needed. So I just left because obviously they didn't have time for me!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible I returned my food but it was cold and they re did my food to give me cold food again and there customer service is absolutely horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"... they don't listen to your order.. so, they get it wrong.. you get a few huh's...  The girl who was taking the order, kept saying huh. So you want a combo. No, Just the sandwich. One of the orders was a combo meal. we get to the window. we got charged for two combos. they gave us two fries but only one drink. Come on if your going to charge me extra give me everything I paid for.... we waited till they poked there head out the little window. let them know we didn't want two combos. The Young girl maybe 17 looked at the man, who seemed to be the manager.. He said well, and pointed to the receipt. we just asked for a portion of our $$ money back. She didn't seem to have much of an idea of what she was doing and he said to her Mija, and put his hand out like ill get this. he did give us our money back.   So we head out on the way to California. begin to eat our burgers.. SO SO Dry they fries we soggy. I was very disappointed.  we dont usually eat much fast food. but... get it together. I know its a new location but its not like your creating a plate.   will probably give it a second shot to see if maybe they were just having an off night."}
{"text":"Well, I have to say , even with the coupons, it cost me $8.00. ????  Didn't order but 2 of the $1.00 menu a drink and onion  rings. $8.00 . Got to start making better decisions"}
{"text":"Very disappointed  with our experience  today. My husband  had ordered our  food got home and  they messed up his sandwich . He went back to get his order  corrected. The. Girl looked at him like he was crazy. He also told her  he wanted new fries because they were  already cold. She took his fries and dumped them in there other  ones. He told her you can't do that,  she asked him why?????? Are you kidding me."}
{"text":"This is the best Berger King ever. 10 starsI lobe the food and service here"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would. This place is filthy! The only thing good about it was the fries because we asked for no salt which they had to make fresh batch. Our burgers were rare, and splashed with SO much mayonnaise. The food was one thing, the building was disgusting, flies came out of no where, and when I asked, who looked like the manager, to clean a table, he was annoyed. The ticket was 32.77, I took our burgers back and my nephews chicken nuggets (which were freezer burned) and told her about our situation so she (the assistant manager) gave me exactly $13.48 back in cash. SERIOUSLY!!!! I've never felt so Unwelcomed and disrespected in my life. This was last night by the way around 8pm. Horrible customer service, horrible good, and filthy place to eat."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and as long as I don't alter my order, it's fine. BUT if you ask them to leave something off, they'll put it on anyways. Like for some reason no mayo translates to extra mayo ?. Service is speedy and the ppl are nice just watch what you order. And check before you leave!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday morning as I was waaaaaay early for an interview in the area. Since it was 10am I ordered breakfast. I normally get an egg and cheese croissant, but I decided To try the sourdough breakfast king. I should've stuck to my original plan. The bread was dry and not very exciting or flavorful. The egg was hot but the cheese was not melted at all. See photos.  Glad I ate in as the sandwich desperately needed salt and pepper. Also, the hashbrowns tasted weird. I don't know how to describe it, but it wasn't like usual. I wound up throwing them away. The only positive note food wise, was That they had the new soda machine that has all the different flavors. The gentleman taking my order was quite nice and friendly and the place was clean and quiet. Unsure if I'd visit again."}
{"text":"I ordered the new Swiss, Bacon, Sourdough burger a couple days ago and it looked so good on the menu-board picture... it was awful!  It was totally cold. Couldn't have been colder if it was taken out of the cooler. Even the sourdough bread slices were ice cold. Oh well... my fries were hot and the service was fast and friendly. The burger sucked though."}
{"text":"Ok had to write a little something ... had the new grilled hotdogs ...and I've got to say they did fairly well... the buns were not quite as warm as needed ,but the chili was good and the grilled dog had good flavor.... pretty good for a chain place. I'll be back  it was quick, convienent  and tasty."}
{"text":"This location is a hit or miss.  Sometimes i get home with my order to discover that instead of marinara sauce, my mozza sticks came with some other kind (got bbq or zesty before). Its fine if you ran out- but they should tell you at the window and ask which sauce you want instead. Who wants mozza sticks with bbq sauce ??  Other times, i get the wrong order entirely - sometimes this gives me a chance to try menu items id never order, but thats not always for the best.  They are open all the time and the line moves fast at night- however, thats when the order usually comes wrong.  The staff isnt the best - not very friendly.  Love the oreo cheesecake!  Burgers.... usually just taste old."}
{"text":"I just ordered a Burger King stack and large fries and they gave me a bacon burger and small fries. Get your life together Burger King."}
{"text":"Fries were cold, and, the breading on the chicken for my sandwich seemed like it had been in the warmer for too long. The box to my pie was opened already?... Overall the staff were nice and the tables were clean, but, time-tags need to be utilized, and, as much as I love front-porch-sitting; the back doors need to have screens on them so not so many flys get in.... if they're going to be open all the time that is. Just sayin'"}
{"text":"I ordered classic dog  on driver thru, i got my food and found out it was still frozen , so i had to driver all over around the traffic to get another one, the lady at the window took then looked at it and threw it in trash can and said am getting another one. so few minutes later got my new Dog but it was dried cause it was overlooked in the microwave. I have the picture. the entire time i was there all the employees were talking in spanish so that didnt help either. NEVER, NEVER go there again.!!!"}
{"text":"1, speak english this is America 2.only one person cooking 3.driver thru gets fast service than counter orders, I waited 20 minutes for my food while they all serving the driver thru, I thought I was in mexico or something,I have nothing against spanish but no english word was used the entire time i was there, I know they deal with lots of homeless people due to the location but DONT TREAT EVERYONE LIKE THAT!!! I asked for my money back and took off."}
{"text":"-* I  agree with Brittany M she hit the nail on the head. never seen this before, very unprofessional and nonchalant. These are the people that want 15 bucks an hr ? YEA RIGHT"}
{"text":"Wow. They say you should wrap a bad review with the positive.  The positive part is they were open.  I can honestly say I will NOT return except to use the whopping 50% off card on DRINKS. Not food. I ordered a Chicken Fries meal, my (adult) grand-daughter ordered a burger meal. They parked us. NO cars in line behind us.  ZERO. We were parked for 15 or 20 minutes. They brought our 'food' out. Asked if it was okay that they subbed Chicken Rings since they didn't have chicken fries.... yeah, it's okay. We took our food and left. Had I known they apparently dug the chicken rings from the breakage bin and refried them, I would have opted for Jack-In-The-Box! They were as tough and dry as shoe leather! I'm sorry we bothered you to actually need to cook something at 11:15 in the evening. I worked at  McD's and Jack.  If I wouldn't eat it, I didn't serve it. Might be an attitude BK takes on? And you people want  $15 an hour for the garbage you pass off as food?"}
{"text":"I was running errands and was starving!!  I noticed a brand new Burger King on st. Rose parkway. I headed in to grab a quick lunch. I had the whopper jr and the Oreo shake. It was the same Burger King quality no complaints. They even had one of those fancy soda machines with the touch screen. I mean don't go expecting the quality of a fancy burger place. But if you are hungry and in the area it is worth it."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru at 10 pm on a Sunday website AND sign on the door says open till midnight....guess someone forgot to tell the employees...its cool tho McDonald's took my money!!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! Had to drive around twice waiting to get out on busy pearl rd traffic because there is no way around building except for out. They gave me diet coke instead of regular then messed up my chicken strip order, drowning it with BBQ sauce when I asked for plain! Don't waste your time here!!! Incompetent workers. Check your order before pulling away from drive thru!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. I went there today for an early lunch and I waited in the drive thru for 30 min with no one from management or inside to explain what the problem was. I had to back out of the drive thru. I can't comment on the food since I didn't get any. I won't ever go back. New management whatever"}
{"text":"Satisfactory burger king restaurant. Exactly what you would expect from a fast food chain restaurant."}
{"text":"An average burger king. I've never had any issues at this location.  Food is usually out pretty quick and haven't had them ness any orders up."}
{"text":"Husband stopped at the drive thru about 6pm and the food was practically cold 5 minutes later when he arrived home."}
{"text":"Poor Juan. He got chewed out by his boss while we were here. I'm guessing it was his first day on the job. Our order was taken correctly by the cashier, but Juan ended up getting a few things wrong. When we took the food back to the counter, the manager yelled at Juan for messing it up. My Bacon King was pretty good except the bacon tasted as if it had been sitting out for a while. I was going to take it back to the counter to ask for some better bacon, but I figured Juan had been through enough already."}
{"text":"Our experience here started off rough but ended up ok. It must have been the first day for the cashier we encountered here. I had to repeat myself a few times and request a few corrections to the order. Thankfully, the manager came over and fixed everything. The food ended up being very good!"}
{"text":"We had a good experience with this place. The guy taking our order was friendly, our order was processed quickly, and the Whopper combo I got was pretty good! They remembered the cheese I asked for."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this Burger King's drive through service is one of the slowest I've ever seen in the morning. Been stopping there regularly for the last couple of weeks at various time and found no change. Always seem to sit in line from 15 to 20 minutes every time."}
{"text":"Went to drive through. Food was mediocre but everyone was SO HUNGRY so we just wanted food. Their fries are awful"}
{"text":"Made 2 breaded chicken sandwiches that were delicious.  The fries at Burger King are a little thick and so good.    Service was extremely friendly and stayed open past 10 just to make us our order. (If I had known they were closing I wouldn't have pulled in, but they didn't turn the lights off in the lobby until after I paid) and they never mentioned anything about closing which I respect.  Staying open a few more minutes to make more money makes sense.  Also I came here after the McDonalds down the street told us they didn't make chicken past 10pm... After making us sit at the drive thru for 5 minutes.  This BK probably made me a BK better than McDonalds supporter."}
{"text":"The Worlds SLOWEST and worst run BK for miles. If you're not waiting inside for a while, you are PARKED in the drive thru for what seems to be forever! If you only have a few minutes to spare, go to Sonics - they have better service and much more appreciation for you lunch time."}
{"text":"I go through the drive thru 9 out of 10 times. I decided to eat inside because my car AC wasn't working right. As I go in I notice how nice this place looks inside. New soda despencer, looks remodled. Then I went to order.............k........so im waiting there for like 10 min. because they were under staffed. Finally the lady turns around. Not even asking, she helps this guy who just walked in. They both acted like I wasn't there. I confronted the guy and he made this shit eating grin saying he thought I was still trying to decide. The lady was like, don't worry about him sir. I walked the fuck out of there."}
{"text":"Drive thru....they ask for payment and then tell you to park out front because it will be a few minutes. Seriously?   Done with this place. I don't have time to wait for fast food."}
{"text":"Ordered a meal in the drive Thru and was told to pull up front to wait. After waiting a few minutes the order arrived and the employee left. When I got home my order was wrong. I was charged for a medium meal and only received a small onion ring with it."}
{"text":"I got French toast sticks and no syrup. All of my food was soggy and lukewarm at best. Admittedly Burger King is far from my favorite, but this one is the worst I've ever been to. The food always tastes like it was cooked in old oil hours before you even ordered it. I've tried this location a few times since it's the closest drive thru to my apartment, but today was bad enough that I will never come back to this location, and probably even this whole chain in general, again."}
{"text":"I was waiting for my drive thru order and two girls were arguing about their schedules with their shifts and my order was also incorrect  Just inconsiderate"}
{"text":"I like BK, but I was at the drive through window at lunch and the guy on the intercom called me boss a couple of times. Are we in the hood? To my surprise, I get to the window, expecting a 16 year old kid and the supervisor/manager hands me my change and says, \"Thanks Boss\".  Apparently, the guy didn't take the class on how to properly communicate with your customers. The ghetto is 20 miles east."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite for the kids.  They have ICEEs here! Only $1 for a small size in cherry or coke flavor.  My son loves plain cheeseburgers and they got the order wrong, he was not happy:(  10 percent off when you use your Military Star card or Exchange Gift Card. Another perk? No taxes!  So buy on base!  According to the base directory they are open M-F from 6 a.m. - 8 p.m. , Sat. 8-6 p.m. and Sunday 11 a.m. - 5 p.m.    No playland here.  Uses the same building as Popeye's Chicken located right in front of the BX."}
{"text":"This was the best fast food experience I've ever encountered. I honestly felt like I was in a 5 star restaurant. The customer service was impeccable. I felt cared about and important, something that I rarely feel in my life. My trip to Burger King tonight completely rejuvenated my spirits and re-energized me for the turmoils and stress that naturally come in life. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying our expectations were not high out of the gate however they still managed to disappoint us. I lost over a thousand dollars in vegas and this was still the worst part of my trip. My friend ordered chicken fries and a whopper and they gave her a fish sandwich and no chicken fries. Next they attempted to correct the order and by some mistake we ended up with a side of onion rings bonus.....? Wrong they were gross a lot. I suggest almost any other option in this terminal. This place is the king of nasty tasteless food and lame service."}
{"text":"Soda machine was broken, fries super cold, bathrooms closed, and good took forever. Employees were nice though...."}
{"text":"I LOATHE this location... Should've left it burnt to the ground.  Nothing makes you feel dumber than paying $17 for a bag of dog food. Thanks for the RAW fries.... I guess they're too busy fighting off tweaked couples showering in their bathroom to get the food right."}
{"text":"For a fast food restaurant this is one of the best Burger King stores I have been to. The Manager on duty was very friendly and kind. Very Clean store."}
{"text":"This is the burger king they forgot. Stepping into the place is like stepping into a time machine. I'm reminded of the burger king of my youth (early 90s) where the gang & I would go after school. I kid you not, the upholstery in the booths is the same. The food is just bleh. Also...10/10 smells like a gym locker. Can confirm because I've been back twice. (don't judge me, its the nearest BK to my place and I love my whoppers)"}
{"text":"They got our order wrong even though they asked us to pull up front and wait... We ordered a #7 without mustard including a small fry and a small coke, a veggie burger also with a small fry and a small coke, and a large fry. What we received was two burgers from the #7 WITH mustard, a regular burger, two small fries, and two small cokes. Did I mention I'm vegetarian so the burger I received, I won't even eat. Terrible service... We didn't pay money for food we didn't want."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today (through the drive thru) and it was pretty good the only bad things was that it took about ten minutes waiting at the window to get our food. which would have been fine if the food was hot like they said it was, and the other bad thing was that the lettuce was really old and gross, almost transparent. But the service was good and they were really polite."}
{"text":"Christmas day and I'm starving. (Don't ask lol) I end up in need of a coke. I don't want to get dressed from my cute Christmas PJs so I need a drive thru that understands haha. I notice burger king is open.  There is a sign at drive through saying the grill is out. I order chicken sandwich and fries and coke. I get to the window and peek through window. They are short staffed, working hard and have issues with things just going wrong.  BUT! The staff has an amazing attitude. They don't want to be there but are still professional and happy.  Christmas is still Christmas no matter where you go. Kudos to all those who had to work Christmas! And did so with a great attitude! PS the food was actually great :)"}
{"text":"So I have been hitting a lot of food on the go lately, mostly because we are finishing up building a house and moving so thing are a wreck in the kitchen, and we are in a hurry to eat and get back to moving/unpacking.  That being said this is a pretty good Burger King.   It was remodeled about a year ago and well hey it's not gourmet but it's fast, cheap, and you know what you are getting."}
{"text":"The woman Joana was so rude and when ordering our food she rudely just said \"what do you want.\" Not professional nor respectful under any circumstances, definitely needs a reevaluation on her job description."}
{"text":"We were shorted a breakfast sandwich and a order of hash browns. We ordered a large hash brown and got a small in a large container because they didn't fill it up all the way. My French toast sticks were just thrown into a bag and the female at the drive thru window was unprofessional, immature and rude. We waited 20 minutes for our order, meanwhile we could see her standing there laughing and talking with other employees. When she gave us our order she said \"here you go\", practically threw it at us and closed the window in our face. When we got home and noticed the order was wrong, I called the manager and he said to come in the next day and he would replace our order. Went in the next day and got our food, she put it on the tray as if I was dining in and I said it was supposed to be to go. She seemed pissed off she had to bag it for me because that's the way it was supposed to be anyways.. started driving off and noticed I was missing our milk and OJ. Had to go back in and get it. I WILL NEVER BE COMING HERE AGAIN!!! Every single time we come here they always screw up the order. How freaking hard is it to get the order right?? Obviously they are not capable of putting a few sandwiches into a bag. I've worked at a BK before and all you have to do is look at the screen, make the order correctly and put in the bag. It's not that difficult. They need to hire all new management and everybody needs to get a clue on how to treat their customers with respect."}
{"text":"All Burger Kings are not the same.  Only one in the area so I was dumb enough to go back again over the last 10 or 12 years.  Every bun has been stale.  When you open the wrapper, the sandwich looks like a toddler put it together.  EVERY TIME.  To top it off, I have never seen an employee be even close to pleasant. I blame myself for going back but Burger King corporate for not being aware of this horror for 10 years.  I don't usually write negative reviews either."}
{"text":"I don't eat fast food much but each time I go here I'm not disappointed . Friendly staff , sometimes there's a lot of cars but that's anywhere the food is better then Mickey ds , the fries are pretty good . It's fast food can't expect anything much ."}
{"text":"I had placed a order on yelp for delivery right across the parking lot. Order said it'd take 30min!? Then I tried calling the restaurant 14 times so I can ask if they could put extra ranch dressing and salt and pepper and they don't pick up their phone, after calling a million times I could hardly hear him and he hangs up and the phone goes straight to voicemail. Finally the manager picked up and he states that he has no clue about my order and that they only do GrubHub and obviously does it know about yelp goes threw GrubHub! Business needs new management ASAP and someone who speaks good English!!  Terrible service! Food isn't that great either."}
{"text":"On the way home decided that cooking is out of the question so stopped in at Burger King to get the twins dinner. The store was clean, but all the doors were open when I came up to the restaurant. I inquired with the cashier why this was happening and she informed me that there air conditioning is on the Frits. I feel for the staff here at the King. They all have such great attitudes and a friendly smile to greet the guest though.   They have fans blowing but with out hot desert air it is not the same as air, but at least they are trying to keep the atmosphere of the dining experience all good and well. Acts of god are not counted against anyone. This could happen to anyone. It is how they are working together as a collective and ensuring that the guests are comfortable and happy. So thanks to this Burger King crew I hope that your air gets fixed soon.   I ordered the food to go and decided on two orders of 10 pieces nuggets. That way the twins each have their own. Even at 15 they still fight. I also got them plain cheeseburgers too. Plus the puppy will need something from here too. One cannot bring cheeseburgers home without one for the furry baby. On my way thanks Burger King for having such superior attitudes and great team!!!"}
{"text":"Visited this Burger King the kids wanted some cheeseburgers and onion rings this is the place to go. The food was so so, not exciting for anything and a great value for the money. The staff was very friendly and welcoming to customers. The store was very clean and well maintained. The employees were even cleaning the lobby and the outside windows and doors as well."}
{"text":"I usually stop by at this location to get my coffee, breakfast sandwich or lunch salad but a few days ago I  received a very ugly surprise.  The manager in charge was very professional about the situation he offered and refund and a new salad (which I declined) since I lost my appetite.  Staff is always friendly here this was just a very incovenient thing that happened."}
{"text":"I don't know why this BK is next to empty every time I visit.  Maybe it is the location.  The truth is the burgers taste okay, the soda is all-you-can-drink, the store is clean and spacious, and the restroom is clean.  The only bad thing in the past is the coffee.  I visited yesterday, and the coffee was better, not good yet but better than before, kind of similar to A&W coffee."}
{"text":"Aweful service i am a regular customer i go almost every night after the gym and last night when i went i asked for a plain burger just meat and bun the lady said we dont have that, ( a burger joint that does have plain burgers what a joke ) sbe was very rude and yelling at me , then another lady came onto the intercom and it took 10 mins to take my order for a simple sandwhich , as i go up to the window to pay the lady says \"heres your fucking plain burger\" worst service ever very rude and disrepctful i am a regular customer and womt be back unless they are fired , i hope the manager of this establishment will email me to have this settle i recommend you dont come here , it was at 2 am on sunday , it was a older white lady with white hair and a middle aged black women with dark brown hair something must be done they are very rude disrepectful and scumfull employees"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru on this particular day. The staff and management got my food order really fast and the drive-thru waitress was very nice and courteous. My order was complete with no errors and food was hot to serve."}
{"text":"Holy crap! I think this is the worse service I've ever received, I can't believe it! The girl who served us was incredibly rude. First the drive thru speaker sounds is so low as it was then she tells us how they don't have long buns for the cheese burger! The Story Goes On It was just unbelievable how much crap we dealt with in just one trip. Just drive right by this place don't look back."}
{"text":"Awful everyone time we go. They ran out of fries and ketchup and the wait was really long. Second time they forgot part of our order. Get it together."}
{"text":"It's no different than any other Burger King I've been to except they can never seem to get my order right in the drive thru. I just don't bother with this location anymore.  The burgers are fine just probably not the burger you ordered, have the wrong size, wrong flavor of soda...you get the idea."}
{"text":"So there are literally 17 people that have ordered and are waiting for their food. Two had to leave while waiting because their flight is boarding.   Attitude of employees is so I DON'T CARE it's ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"Mookie  in the drive thru is very professional and kept saying huh after every item I ordered. To make it worst she got the order work. Someone in upper management needs to talk to her or do something about this."}
{"text":"Though a bit dirty. My order was correct, food was normal to BK's standards, they offered Jalapeños for my burger, which was cool!"}
{"text":"Went thru the drive Thru and there was a disabled vehicle in the lane and signs on the door that said closed. 8 pm."}
{"text":"I got a medium sized onion rings and a small soda. You pour your own soft drink so you could get refills. I saw a man bring his Starbucks cup to the Burger King coffee dispenesor. The onion rings were much smaller (both in size of each ring and overall quantity) than I expected them to be. I would have liked for them to be crispier.  They were freshly fried however. I asked for a zesty sauce but they forgot to give me one. I didn't have it my way. There's plenty of seating between Starbucks and Burger King. This place is located in the D terminal area. They don't have milkshakes, but they do sell pies. The workers here were quick."}
{"text":"This Burger King has the worst customer service, by far of any fast food restaurant I have ever been to.  The employees seem slow, stupid, and lazy.  Like they have no idea what they are doing.  I have been to this Burger King a number of times because it is close to where I live.  I will NEVER go to this Burger King again.  Do yourself a favor and go to Culvers instead."}
{"text":"Burger King..  You think 2 burger patties cheese and grilled onions is called a \" Philly Cheese steak sandwich\"  worst sandwich I've had in a long time..and should not be called a Philly Cheese steak.."}
{"text":"It was a Wednesday and I felt like having a fast food burger. Since the weather wasn't that great outside and I work in a building connected to the underground city (and I didn't want to go outside), I decided to eat something from one of the food courts. I decided to eat at Burger King since they had a promotion on Wednesdays for their Whopper Trio (Whopper burger, fries, and drink).  Service is typical of a fast food place at a food court in a shopping mall.  Nothing really stands out and nothing really to complain about in terms of food. The 2 benefits of eating here as opposed to walking a short distance and eating at the Burger King on Ste-Catherine Street across the street from The Bay is that you don't have to worry about the weather and you don't have to worry about vagrants. The only negative about eating here as opposed to eating at the Burger King near The Bay is that you can't get a refill on your drink which I like to do after I finish my food."}
{"text":"This Burger King restaurant is across the street from The Bay (La Baie).  I found myself at this place when one of my work colleagues told me about a special that Burger King was having on their chicken nuggets (10 pieces for $1.99). There are a few Burger Kings within the area where I work with one of the Burger Kings being within the \"underground city\" (at the Eaton Center food court) but I went to this Burger King mainly because I was going back to work after having done some shopping on Ste-Catherine Street.  This is a typical fast food (Burger King) restaurant. There is free WiFi in this Burger King. The line-up wasn't too long at the time that I went (close to the end of my lunch period). I purchased 20 chicken nuggets and a drink. This Burger King has a self-serve soft drink fountain.  The only complaint that I have is that like most of the fast food restaurants downtown which I've visited that aren't connected to the \"underground city\", there are sometimes vagrants that will show up. This is the unfortunate situation in downtown Montreal. During my visit there was someone who obviously had psychological issues mumbling to himself and kept repeating the same gibberish over and over again. In a fast food restaurant connected to the \"underground city\", you don't have these same issues since security in the mall/building will generally ask these people to leave immediately. The only two real benefits of eating at this Burger King as opposed to eating at a Burger King which is connected to the underground city (such as the one inside Eaton Center) is that this Burger King has a self-serve soft drink machine so it is easier to get a refill before leaving and the other reason is that it is open more hours (and later) than a Burger King inside the \"underground city\" because they aren't forced to close when the shopping mall closes.  I rate this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"Come to get some of there fire chicken Fries and she forgot to give me some ranch ._. The chicken fries where still gas but she hella slacked with that ranch:("}
{"text":"This Burger King is not too bad for a fast food chain; they are quick, food prep was good and friendly staff.  The girlfriend and myself got the 2 can dine whopper coupon, priced for $9.50. Good deal for 2 meals. The turnover was quick and we were in out of that place. They didn't cheap out on the ketchup and mayo packets and the fries was fresh from the fryer and salted to my liking.  It's not too often I'll see myself at a fast food chain. But if I need a lunch and coupon is available, Burger King will always be one of my choices."}
{"text":"Worst Burger King I have been to. This is the 3rd time I have went through the drive through and my order has not been right there. Drive Thru attendant was arguing with another employee about taking out trash while I was waiting for my order. Get home to eat my lunch and the lettuce was rotten looking, cheese forgotten on my burger and soft drink full of ice and hardly any drink. I could see Mishaps happening if they were slammed busy, but there were only 2 cars in line at the drive thru and inside was slow. I would advise going somewhere else for lunch or dinner. I will never be back."}
{"text":"I don't understand the prior Yelps. This is an extremely clean restaurant. Every time I come here the food comes out hot and fresh. The service staff is always attentive and so is the restaurant manager. If you are in the mood for quality food served fast, give this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"The customer service that i experienced here is one of the worst I've ever had. I have never left a restaurant in a furious mood so this is the first.   Food= gross.  Came to this restaurant for some simple breakfast before my flight came. Got two meals for me and my friend and forked out $24..most expensive burger king ive ever been to. The food came out very fast. Tater tots was extremely salty and sandwich was extremely oily. Me and my friend could not finish it in fear we would get sick during my flight.  Customer Service level = -1 They got one of my order wrong so i went up to the person serving the food to let her know the bacon was missing. I did it politely and was not mad at all. So I showed her but she then acted like i was lying so she rudely snatched the sandwich and completely opened it and checked around with her ungloved hand. She saw i was telling the truth and gave me another one with a rude attitude. B** i forked $24 when it should have only been $12-$13 and you gave me the wrong order and you have the nerve to be rude to me. Im still seething so if you see this Burger King and contemplating whether to eat here, best to avoid this place like the plague and eat somewhere else.  Never ever again will i come to this restaurant at the airport!!"}
{"text":"every time I come here I get the worst look from all the girls whether I walk in or go through the drive through and I hate to sound racist cuz I'm not but it's just the two Mexican girls there and when I get my Burger I always get a burnt Patty now I drive a few more miles to go to the next one"}
{"text":"The turnover rate at this business is very high. When they are fully staffed with people who can read their customer service is great, however; most of the time their staff consists of uneducated Illiterates who can't cook, let alone read the order screen.  The Sky might fall if they have to make change!  The new hot dogs are disgusting! They may have been good, but the night shift couldn't grasp the concept of what I ordered and I ended up with a gross mess of crap."}
{"text":"I frequently come to this one but usually through the drive thru but dine in too. It's 2pm and no one has cleaned the dining room or around the beverages. The one time I was here at lunch the manager was arguing with a coworker in front of customers. So unprofessional and the coworker ended up leaving."}
{"text":"Hash browns were freshly crispy and on point, the french  toast sticks on the other hand were noticeably over  cooked and very crunchy. I feel I get the best fast food when I request a \"fresh drop\" at the ordering window, I will keep this in mind when ordering the french toast sticks next time. I also got a egg, cheese and sausage croissant and I was grossed out by the egg (I'm pregnant so I get squeamish about foods easily lol) but the manager was nice enough to just swap it out for a sausage biscuit instead. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Pricey fast-crap served by rude people. The food was sub-par (even for Burger King) and cold when I received it. If it wasn't for the pure convenience, it would get a 1 star."}
{"text":"I don't normally review fast food places but I went through the drive thru and they didn't have my food ready do I waited out front...for 15 minutes. I went inside and it was pretty empty. I see the back was all hectic...didn't look like anyone knew what was going on. There were professor 10 tickets hanging, burgers and food stacked up at the pass, and no one bagging them. Needless to say...the organization of the place was pretty bad. Service was ok....just needs to have things run more smoothly."}
{"text":"Not happy with the service at all. Went in for a quick snack on lunch and was met by the rudest woman at the front desk who took my order. She told me to \"hurry up\" while I looked over the menu and kept rushing me to place my order meanwhile there was no one else in line. To top it off my burger was freezing cold and my fries were half full. Never going back."}
{"text":"Located conveniently on the intersection of Spadina and College, if you ever get the hankering for some cheap burgers and fries, with the threat of Toronto's finest psychotics in your presence, this is the place to go to.  Nothing really unique or special stands out in comparison to other Burger Kings.  I would recommend this place if you want a cheap meal or if you want to eat your feelings away"}
{"text":"Good place to have coffee and let the grand kids run wild on the slide and play area.  Sneak a Whopper while grandma is not looking, some fries and promise her I'm watching my diet... grab a shake to go!"}
{"text":"i ordered a whopper this morning. i heard the colored lady say to the cook  don't drop the meat to much. After i got my whopper, i went to work and trow my whopper away. i just could not bear the thought that my whopper could have been drop in the floor on purpose. i called the corporate office and relayed my complaint. i spoke to somebody in india. i been in this burger king so many times. i hope i had not been eating a burger that's been drop in the floor."}
{"text":"BK @ RT-82 and 480/14 Twinsburg.   I'm a sucker for cheap nuggets so I frequent this BK a few times a month while at work ......maybe more than I should but tats another story.     Lets start with for the most part everything is fine, I mean lets be realistic, its 10 nuggets for a buck 49 we're not talking \"life Styles of The Rich and Famous \" here !!   Sometimes the nuggets might be a bit cool but they do have you in and out pretty fast at lunch and that's important because I want to be back to work making my boss proud of me ASAP.     Now for what REALLY prompted me to risk carpel tunnel, the PARKING LOT LINES !!   WHO was the genius who thought it would be \"better\" to make the lines straight as opposed to the way they \"used\" to be for years !! ??   ITS COMPLETELY STUPID !!    The parking spots that run to the right as you pull in are perpendicular to the building, they used to be at about 30 degs that made it real simple to pull in and back out ...but NOW,  its like Austin Powers in the hallway trying to move around in the parking lot .  When you drive thru, look at the cars they are not in the lines and most are slightly skewed because you CAN't turn your car 90 degs in the driveway space !!   Another thing, someone is FOR SURE going to get backed into because the drive thru backs up at peak hrs so you know someone is going to get in their car get all situated then someone will pull in behind them in the drive thru and get backed into, its going to happen.      Time to get out the black seal-coat and start over !!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you like waiting.  Every time I have been here, they are almost empty, and I still have to wait 12+ minutes for food.  50% of the time, the order is wrong in bizarrely fantastic ways.  Worst BK ever.  Needs new management.  Avoid!"}
{"text":"When my family and I walked into the door the workers were laughing and talking loud while cursing. My 3 year old son is now saying, \"shit\" after one of the employees. Hopefully he doesn't start saying, \"bitch\" as well. My child never says bad words until now. The food was decent aside from a breakfast sandwich my husband had that was not freshly made. Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"It's a BK, so it is what it is. When I stop here it's usually on a Saturday afternoon and the service is acceptable or even good most of the time. I can't really complain, it's slightly above average."}
{"text":"For a fast food chain, cheap and Sometimes semi fast food, this particular BK isn't too shabby."}
{"text":"Service is slow food is cold alot of the staff member have poor attitudes.There are alot of people who are on drugs they come in and sit for  most of the day and make a commotion for no reason throw drinks in the floor because their so high a mess I tell you"}
{"text":"I know it's Burger king but still.  All I ask is that my food be hot. If not hot, at least warm.  Airport food is expensive and I realize that.   Don't eat here unless you like cold food and self service coffee that is warm."}
{"text":"Elizabeth was the nicest person ever!! I do not believe I have ever received such service from a FF restaurant.  Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"-This So-Called \"King\" Is Slacking-  I love Burger King, and I love fast food, but this location is not good. It may be good in a pinch, but there are many better fast food establishments nearby that would satisfy your craving. If you really feel like driving, the North Royalton location is 5x better.  Upon approaching the drive-thru, you will normally notice that it's empty. There might be a car in the drive-thru, but I never see anybody eating inside. It's pretty desolate, especially when Arby's and Sí Señor (locations nearby) are typically getting a regular flow of people. This should be a major tip-off that this place is not all that great. If you choose to continue, you will also realize that the plants are unkempt, almost reaching out to your car. Do not order by meal number, I learned the hard way that the menu board is in constant need of replacement. Of the few times I've been there, the meal number I ordered did not correspond to the meal number within their system, resulting in me getting a different sandwich.  The overall worst part of going to this location is the employees. 9 out of 10 times you will get an employee that is there to get a paycheck, nothing more. You won't get a \"Thank you\" or a \"You're welcome\", you won't get a smile, they will not even ask you if you want a Whopper with or without cheese (at other locations they will normally ask, but if you do not tell them at this Burger King, they will assume that you don't want cheese). You will get the bare minimum that the employee can get away with. A good employee is about as common as a unicorn there. If you're lucky enough to get a good employee, they seem to be polite, conversational, and care about their job. It's just highly unlikely. Customer service is, and has always been, a big deal for me. That's what irks me about this Burger King. When you're working at a drive-thru, you don't have to do a lot in order to provide a pleasurable experience. When it comes to fast food, I am willing to take even the slightest bit of courtesy.  The food is exactly as you'd expect. It's normally halfway decent, just like many other fast food restaurants and Burger King locations.  If you're planning on going here, I strongly suggest that you rethink your decision and give your hard earned money to a business that actually deserves it."}
{"text":"My husband went there for breakfast and had to go back 3 times because each time they got his order wrong. It's not hard to read the screen on an order. A few times I went there through the drive-thru the person could barely speak English, wow!!!!!!! I should have to speak another language other than English just to get my food order across and get it correct the first time."}
{"text":"You may want to let your employees know that when they work the window the customer in the car can hear everything you say. There were two younger girls working the drive thru window and for some reason we're candidly using unacceptable language like bitch in their conversation. I don't care how you talk in your free time but when I pull up to the window and I can hear bitch, among other things, loudly multiple times it's unprofessional and unacceptable. No plans on returning to any burger king because employees have no manners."}
{"text":"This place is literally a dumpster, garbage everywhere inside and outside. Stay far away from this place unless you like to see trash everywhere and the food tastes like trash as well. There's just trash everywhere. Never again Burger King. Scratch that your new name is ........... TRASH BURGER"}
{"text":"Slow as hell drive thru...I have tried to give them a chance but on 3 seperate occasions I have say in line waiting for 6-8 minutes...I. stop here bc it's on my way to work....why does it take so damn long? I finally got to the window and asked what was taking so long and the girl said she was the only one on staff...who ever is managing that place is doing a poor job at scheduling...morning, lunch and dinner hours are your peak times you should be fully staffed. I don't care if you just spent a ton of money to make your building look nice...if the service is slow people won't come. Oh and to top it off she charged my card the wrong amount, then gave me the money back for the mistake but then didn't charge the proper amount to my card....you are losing money and my business."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the workers at this location. Clorinda gave exceptional service and we left satisfied!"}
{"text":"this is the worst Burger King ever    ask for a sour dough  king with bacon, get a 1/4 pound burger, and watch what bill you give out and what change you get back.  and NO shakes \"today\""}
{"text":"This BK so far has been the only one I keep coming back to. Fast service with great customer service. My food is always still hot when I get home. Food is leads on top with flavors and done right ;)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day since it is close to work. I ordered a grilled chicken ranch wrap. Got a fried chicken wrap with honey mustard. Chicken was fatty and gross but I should have expected that I guess. Not trying that again"}
{"text":"So I ordered 4 whoppers from this location and the only special thing I asked was for extra pickles and onions on 2 of them. When we ate the whoppers the 2 that were special ONLY had pickles and onions. There weren't any tomatoes, lettuce, or mayo. The 2 that were plain had the smallest portion of lettuce. I know that people don't like lettuce. I don't either but there's too much lettuce and there's just enough. Well, let's just say that there wasn't even enough lettuce for one bite. This place was horrible. It's simple guys. How do you expect to succeed out there if you can't even get a freakin order right."}
{"text":"Me encanta la comida chatarra y Burguer King es parte de eso.  Lo especial de este local son las mesas al aire libre sobre la terracita a la entrada del lugar. Ideales para disfrutar en los días de primavera/verano aunque a la noche se llena de chicos haciendo la previa o la salida de sábado. Lo malo de esas mesas es que hay muchísimas palomas esperando para comerse tus sobras y puede ser molesto. El interior del lugar es amplio así que siempre vas a encontrar mesa para sentarte. El local tiene un estacionamiento mediano, muy cómodo porque tiene salida por la calle del fondo y podés evitar el tránsito de la avenida. Eso es un plus!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative star I would. Don't go here. Eat anywhere else. This Burger King location is slow, gets your order wrong, and the cashier never gave me my change back. I asked for a water and ended up getting a cup with blue liquid on the bottom. I ended up driving away since I ordered through the drive through. The workers kept complaining about leaving on time and they didn't get paid to put up with this \"shit\" while I was looking them in the eyes. Don't waste your money or your health here."}
{"text":"This is your typical Burger King. I was not impressed. My husband wanted to try the Angry whopper. I ordered the Chicken Sandwich. It was overcooked, and too salty. I felt the fries were over salted as well. The restaurant was dirty. The customer service was okay."}
{"text":"Ya esta todo dicho. Burger King es una cadena hermosa, a la que prefiero sobre Mcdonalds. El local es limpio, buena temperatura, música bajita. La comida, como en todas las sucursales. Me gusta mucho para desayunar (2 tostados y un café grande 50 pé is a good deal)"}
{"text":"We normally get great service when we go to this BK today they could not get a simple order correct. Even the second hamburger wasn't correct I decided to eat the second burger atleast was not bathed in mayonnaise."}
{"text":"Can anyone say, \"Hot Mess?\" This location is a disaster.  I'm not sure what was going on when we popped in for lunch.  I'm actually having a hard time thinking of nice stuff to say in this review, which is never a good thing.  Here are my notes on what needs some serious help at this location!  1. Get more staff! I was there shortly after the main lunch rush (12:45pm) and the place seemed really understaffed for the crowd.  There was only one person talking the in person orders and she was handling the drive thru and pick up window as well.  There was a lady in front of me when I walked in who had been waiting for who knows how long.  We waited for another 5 minutes before being acknowledged.   By this time, there was about 5 people in line behind me. I really only saw 4 people working while I waited.  2. Hire happier people.  I get it, you are at work and stressed out because it is busy, but you don't need to take it out on me! I didn't complain about the wait, I was polite, and i even tried to order something super easy.  Being snapped at is not pleasant, especially when I am being nice.  I felt bad for the employees until i got fussed at!  Geez Louise!  3. Clean up the place, will ya? The area where you get your soda was a mess.  There was spilled drinks and melting ice all over the place.  I know people are slobs, but that means you need to have someone clean up the area from time to time.  There was also straw wrappers all over the place and spilled ketchup near the ketchup pump area.  It was hard to find a clean place to put my tray down to get the items I needed.  4. The playground is super lacking.  First off, it is really small.  Second, it was like an oven in there.  It seemed like very little, if any air was being circulated around in there.  Third, it is definitely made for bigger kids.  The steps in the climbing area were too big for my super tall 2 year old to climb.  She was so sad in there because she couldn't play with the other kids, which is the whole reason we came here!  I can say that the food here was pretty much on par with other BKs, it just took FOREVER to come out.  Needless to say I won't be back to this Burger King any time too soon.  And please listen to my warning if you go during lunch time, otherwise you will be there a LOOOOONG time."}
{"text":"Ahhh, my local BK.  It is like every other BK around and is pretty consistent.  It gets the job done when you are in a rush and don't have time to cook.  I have to admit, I am here pretty regularly.  It is because:   1. I live around the corner and it is the closest place to my house. 2. It is cheap and has ok burgers and chicken sandwiches. 3. My kid loves the milkshakes and smoothies they have on the menu.  I love making her happy, so we visit pretty often. 4. The play place is pretty fun for the little ones.  It is especially nice when it is so hot in the summer.  It is nice and air conditioned, which us Las Vegans LOVE. 5. I may or may not be addicted to the new SatisFries.  This particular location has just gone through a remodel.  It is now more modern with a coffee house style to it.  The food is still the same, but it is now in a prettier locale.  So if you want a fast food joint, this one is pretty and pretty good at what they do."}
{"text":"This is a nice BK.  The building has been remodeled and looks great.  The inside is pretty and looks very modern.  They have the usual seating as well as a little cove with couches and cushy seats to sit and have a coffee.  The playground area is nice and big.  It is 2 stories with a lot of room for the kiddos to run around in.  There is pretty limited seating for adults though with only 3 tables available.  Another bonus was the new automated soda machine.  I love these machines and the abundance of soda choices.  Yummy!  Overall it was a nice BK as compared to the others I have visited."}
{"text":"I rarely feel strongly enough to write a review but I've had multiple bad experiences here. We all have off days every once in a while but this seems to be a pattern. The parking lot never looks clean and there is quite a wait to get service. This location actually isn't 24 hours either. I went there based on the hopes that it was. No answer at the drive thru so I pull around to go inside. The sign on the door says they close at 2. But as I'm walking in, an employee is coming out to tell me they're closed. A full 40 minutes before the posted closing sign. I won't be giving them another chance to turn me away."}
{"text":"I didn't walk up to Burger King with high expectations to begin with therefore this review is just going to focus on one menu item.    Side order of buffalo chicken strips.   Granted it's difficult to fully determine how an order is prepared based upon that little image of chicken strips stacked upon each other up there on top of the menu board, but what I could determine from that avatar of an image is that the stack of buffalo chicken parts isn't drenched, soaking, dripping and or otherwise smothered with buffalo sauce.   There's no way to eat this without a bib and and a spatula.  Not a good choice for running between flights. Good thing I didn't think I could just eat it on the plane.   The item should be called buffalo soup with chicken strips.   As to the flavor? If you can get past the gooey consistency it's a \"meh\"   Avoid the buffalo chicken, just get the plain. It's probably a better level of ordinary."}
{"text":"What a poor experience I had at the BK location.  I admit that I am not the biggest supporter of the King.  I am more of a McD's guy myself.  But when BK has something that catches my eye like a special sale or a new item, I check it out.  This is what happened the other day.  They were offering the Original Chicken Sandwich for just $1.04.  The price was right but the food was all wrong.  The chicken was over cooked and taste burnt.  It had become chewy after sitting under the heat lamps for a while.  The lettuce was barely there and very wilted.  The mayo was and the verge of being bad.  I had to add pickle relish to the sandwich to make it edible.  And my disapointment does not end there.  I also ordered the new sweet potato fries.  Horrible.  I only ate them becauase they cost $1.89 and I am not in the habit of throwing that down the drain.  The fries were over cooked, soggy, and chewey and rather tastless.  Just sort of starchy.  They could have used a little salt which, coming from me, says a lot.  I rarely require salt on anything.  I have been to this BK location before and I'll likely come back again based on nothing more than convenience.  It is close and sometimes a Whopper or a double cheese burger sounds good.  It is far from being my first choice."}
{"text":"My review is only on the drive thru as I didn't go inside. I had a very pleasant experience at this location. The service was exceptional and the food was delicious! The lady taking my order was so nice. She had to bring our food out front because they were waiting on fries. She chatted for a minute and was so kind. If any from this location sees this, please give props to the lady taking order. Not sure if her name but she said she has a son that also works for BK and she's been in the restaurant industry for 30 years. She was great and made our experience so nice! The fries were hot and the burgers were perfect. Will visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Definitely last time I will visit any BK. I like to watch my food being prepared, and what do I spot the worker in the kitchen not wearing gloves touching everything with her bare hands. I approach the shift manager who's watching her prepare everything and ask the manager \"excuse me have rules changed where staff in the kitchen don't have to work with gloves\"? And following that she finally told her to put on gloves.  Businesses like this should lose their licenses, disgusting."}
{"text":"Its fast food so manage your expectation. I generally eat healthy food and as a vegetarian its about the only fast food fast food burger joint I can go to. Burger King has a veggie burger. I'm sure they have to defrost the patty in the microwave when you order it, but good to have the option. Yesterday was my bad day and walked over there from home around 11:30 a.m. First, this location probably hasn't changed since it opened. Retro charming? Looney Tunes time warp. The place looked kept up. Staff seemed a little overwhelmed with the constant flow of orders. Food is what you can expect from a fast food place. The order was correct, and that is one thing you can be thankful for at any fast food place. After we ate, I wanted some dessert, and even though I had been in front of the cashier 15 minutes earlier, she showed 0% recognition. It took longer to get my vanilla cone and Reese's Pie than getting our lunch. In the big scheme of things, our lunch met fast food expectations."}
{"text":"Every once in a little while, I drive through somewhere and get some fast food breakfast on my day off. Hands down, this particular shop has always made really fresh food. The employees are very polite and put together. If they aren't busy (which they are rarely super busy thank goodness) they'll ask you to park in the front for two minutes or so and they will bring you out food that just finished being cooked. I appreciate there attention detail. You don't find that often at all in fast food chains."}
{"text":"Pros. Fast, efficient, friendly  Cons: I'm going to stop coming here. It's not really good for me and today they didn't even bother heating up my food. If I wanted a croissant with a cold cheese slice and chilled ham, I'd make my own at home. That's what I'm going to start doing. This has happened to me twice now."}
{"text":"If you're looking for cold French fries and a sandwich that's been sitting around for hours then I highly suggest this location. Best part of my entire meal was the ample supply of napkins I received."}
{"text":"I really don't write reviews that much about any fast food restaurants, unless it has a big impact on me the customer. Today was no exception, Richard took our order in the cashier section today, and my family and I were happy with the service. He treated us very well and I could not be more happy to see this type of great customer service, it's hard to find. Not only we were enjoying the food, but there were also times where he asked all the customers how they were doing. I honestly miss this type of service and glad that this is still around. Again this is not about the food they serve but more of their customer service."}
{"text":"Pros: consistent food. New and clean. Nothing tastes like the Whopper. Onion ring sauce.   Cons: waited in the drive thru for 15 minutes at 530pm. Way too early for dinner time crowds, right? Not fast food! Why can't I stay away from Burger Kings? I always give them negative reviews for service."}
{"text":"Came in last night around 9:45 pm. Waited longer than usual for my original chicken no lettuce  meal and when I finally got home fries were ice cold and sandwich was burnt.. called in to the manager Chris who was working the window said to come in and they have my name.. billy the GM gave me hell this morning when I came in laughed at me because he supposedly didn't write it .. then after someone in line behind me got their order taken. Then when I. Told him to call the manager Chris he looks at the book one more time and finds the note and again laughs at me .. SHITTY GM SHITTY SERVICE been in the GM position before my self if you can't deal with making up for mistakes quit your job before you get fired ass hole"}
{"text":"I'm so used to getting shitty half assed service when I get late night fast food, that I really don't know how to process this.  When I got to the drive thru order box, the clerk was polite and courteous, using customer service verbiage that I had just assumed went the way of the dinosaurs. When I pulled up to the window she asked if it was ok if I pulled up to the front and waited another 5 minutes for fresher food. Of course that's ok!  After only waiting about a minute up front, the clerk ran (RAN) to my car with my food. The entire order was correct and hot. As my mouth was hanging open in surprise, she wished me a good night.   The service was so good that I didn't even trust it. Seemed especially suspicious. If this was a bad sitcom, I'd be waking up out of a dream.  The clerk's name was Heather. Give her a raise."}
{"text":"Love the spicy chicken. Just tell them off the broiler and it will be fresh and juicy."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience at this location, I'm a loyal customers with burger King me and my wife came to this location placed an order and the employee Ginger gave me the cup for my drink, I went back and told her that the ice machine was out of ice, she gave me a bad look, I ask for the manager and this Yung lady name Bree came and ask her what's wrong she ask, Ginger said that the ice machine doesn't have any ice, so Bree went, to the back then Ginger started mumbling and ignoring me, I asked her what kind of service was that, Bree came to the front because she saw that I was upset, I told Ginger that I was going to make a complaint about this , she responded I don't give a shit she's my manager she's right there, and the manager said I'm the manager you could complain all you want,  I told the manager how hard is it to check out the ice machine it's not working there was at least 5 customers waiting for ice the machine wasn't working everything is on video, I think people like this shouldn't work at places like this, when I got my order my Ex cheese burgers didn't even look the where smash and had no lettuce, so I call the manager and this girl Ginger and told them this doesn't look like the picture and there smash I want my money I told Bree.  The worst experience and the worst place to go."}
{"text":"I've been writing up some fast-food joints lately.  But lately BK has put a couple of items into the \"pick 2 for $5\" promotion.  I have a better idea for less money.  Get a double cheeseburger, have them add pickles and onions.  One is $1.80, obviously 2 would be $3.60.  Delicious!  And less than the $5 they wanted when I drove up.  (P.S. and BTW: Burger King chicken sandwiches might be, no wait,  IS the worst chicken sandwich ever!  Tastes like, feels they pumped air into the chicken.)"}
{"text":"Workers here I just deaf dumb and blind I don't know how you can order a chicken sandwich meal ask for the sweet-and-sour sauce but yet somehow they take it down as a burger meal and instead of sweet-and-sour sauce did you ketchup"}
{"text":"I waited four minutes at the drive-thru window and they wouldn't even take my order at 11:05 on Monday September the 18th I would never return to this Burger King never even got my food"}
{"text":"That was the best Burger King meal we have ever had. The ladies working there were super friendly, and the food was made to order. Definitely worth the wait. I love the hot burger with cold veggies. Sweet potato fries were a great addition. Nicely done."}
{"text":"Someone should turn the fake char machine off,  my breakfast taste like burnt sausage.  Glad this isn't my nearest burger King or I'd be upset.  Also drive thru folks are incredibly rude.    Management should have some quality control when it comes to both.  You can hear the way they speak to people please do something about it.  There are plenty of other people that would be willing to do their job with a smile on their face."}
{"text":"When I go threw the drive threw they almost always make me wait in the parking area by their front doors, corporate should really know how long they actually make customers wait"}
{"text":"Every time I go through the drive thru I get finically raped!! I asked for a whopper jr no tomato heavy mayo and cheese plus an extra slice for .60 extra..also some onion rings...drove home sat down..opened my wrapper and low and behold it was a regular whopper jr and the onion rings were cold. I was pissed so I called to ask them ...WHY...WHY DO U GUYS KEEP JERKING ME OVER. The snotty manager said well bring me your receipt and I will remake it for u. I said listen my family is now sitting down for dinner and I don't feel like driving back to you, she said well call back Monday and speak with the GM. All I could do was take a deep breath and find something in the fridge. I don't want to blame the restaurant..I would rather blame the crew that works this shift. They are horrible irresponsible kids that don't give a damn. I hope Corp sees this and in order to gain me back as a customer I would like my money refunded as well as a few free whopper coupons. I am sick of having to call them 9 out of 10 times to have them correct an order. This is not that complex people..no tomato heavy mayo and extra cheese...is that too much to ask when I am paying for this? It's not like I'm eating here for free."}
{"text":"Terrible service went through drive through with my dad and he asked if we could order the french sticks (as they advertised ) it with a huge sign just before ordering and the guy in drive thru said, \"no.\" then began to giggle as we could hear him laughing through the mike, my dad said uh, OK? And the man kept laughing. When I told him hey it's advertised here he said we don't sell those. And kept laughing, I couldn't believe what just happened, my dad is not a confrontational guy and if he wasn't there I would have called for manager cause this was unacceptable and the jerk was still laughing when we came to window didn't know what he was doing thought his job was a joke who hires thugs like this who insults their customers and laughs at everything like beevis and butthead? Only this burger King! horrible service not going back!"}
{"text":"With limited time you hope to have something quick to eat. It was just that!   Pros - quick order and good food. Even when they said I needed to park to get my fries because they weren't ready yet. I waited just a couple minutes for that! For nice fresh and hot fries!!   Cons - customer service was a bit curt and didn't make me feel welcomed. I know it's fast food but if you want to move up in the business try being more courteous. Like smiling :)"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and ordered the old fashioned chicken sandwich meal, with NO LETTUCE AND EXTRA MAYO. WHEN WE GOT HOME THERE WAS LETTUCE AND NO EXTRA MAYO. THE GUY working the window was in a rush to get us through the line and we were the only car. Their service is usually good but this time they drunk up the place."}
{"text":"I hate to pile on, but this BK isn't well run. I think everyone in this hole of a shopping center might be recruiting help from a less than ideal labor pool. It shows in the customer relations and general cleanliness of the stores and restaurants."}
{"text":"I usually chop up fast food for being just that \"fast food\" and never review since you get what you get. I simply have to because I'm sick of it.  First off I understand we are dealing with young kids working for the first time but what I don't understand that why isn't there someone there managing these people. I went through the drive thru at 7:35pm on 8-29-2017.  Ordering was fine. Got to window and they are so fast to get my money and shut the door to run back to hang out with the boys that were there. As they gave me my order it seemed to be correct. I get it home and I ate an onion ring and it was hard and chew and tasted like cleaner. I began to eat a speciality burger. When I opened it up it was squished to about 3/4 of an inch high.it was supposed to be two patties, bacon and onion rings and BBQ sauce and I opened it up to ketchup, no onion rings and and one strip of bacon. It was so dry that I literally choked on it.  Only thing that was great and I gave it one start is I couldn't do zero starts and my Coke was good. I understand that omg get a life, you get what you get when you go to places like this. Totally understand but I have had great tasting BK and I'm so sick of wasting my money and just saying that you get what you get.  So I guess another BK that I won't go to ever.  Why doesn't there corporate offices read these and address the matter.  I might not go to another BK in my entire life now."}
{"text":"Was decent friendly people. Didn't care for being rushed with the order there wasn't anyone behind us in drive thru.  We ordered for one and just came up with the total when we weren't even done ordering. How about is that going to be all for you? Or how about a simple thank you at the end. Don't think im going to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"If your passing by and thinking about stopping at this burger king KEEP DRIVING!! Their food is nasty(and I like burger king food)but this one's food taste old and cold sometimes. I have tried it more times than I should have, luckily didn't get sick. Their customer service is not the best either but the worst part is the food."}
{"text":"My cashier today seemed to care and she acted like she liked her job.  She was even persistent on me allowing her to pay the change amount out of her penny basket. The other employees also acted like they cared.  They have a posted sanitation grade of 98.0.  The area behind the counter appeared to be clean.  The restroom was clean.  There were some areas of the floor in the dining room that needed to be swept but nothing major.  Our orders came out correctly.  The food was good and warm.  This location exceeded my expectations for a Burger King."}
{"text":"Once again I went to this place expecting to have it my way, and once again I was disappointed! They have NEVER gotten my order right, and it's so frustrating returning to argue the point! Skip this one if at all possible!!"}
{"text":"Talk about the worst customer service on the planet. Walked up to the window three different times by three different people even one was a manager. Never said hi never said wait a second nothing I've been sitting here for about 15 mins now. Terrible fast food, not fast at all! !"}
{"text":"I asked for a number 8 plain with bacon on it and they messed up the order so I kindly asked them if I could get another one...and you can kind of hear the employees in the background talking about my order. So they made me another one and I checked it again and this time the bacon just looked like the grabbed it from the waste bucket. It looked gross. Waste of my money and my time, I won't be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"We are coming from jax Florida and visiting Carolina because of the hurricane We were very hungry and decided to stop at this BK. Let me tell me it was the absolute worst where should I start? the fries were cardboard fries and half full (ordered a medium) even heating it up it was awful and very very hard. The burgers first off it smelled bad it smelled like ass straight ass like it was rotten. The beef was like rubber like it's been sitting all night. I'm upset and not satisfied at all it was a waste really no one ate that crap and it smell sooooo bad. What is going on I was scared to even touch it who knows what they did to it. This is just a disgrace they disrespected me by giving me that crap  and that's what it smell like crap"}

{"text":"I wish I could leave negative stars. This establishment is by far the worst fast food restaurant I've ever been in - and I've been in a lot.  The employees here clearly hate their jobs. I always hope it would change, because let's face it, sometimes you want a dang Whopper. That was the case for me tonight. I walk in - hear the door chime to alert people I was there. I stood at the empty counter and waited. No one shows up. So I shift a little bit since there's an employee there washing trays. She makes eye contact with me then quickly looks away. I wait a few minutes longer. So after more than 5 minutes of waiting to have my order taken... I just decided to leave.  This is not the first bad experience I've had here. It's gone through a few management changes over the past few years, I always thought the service would change... but it never has. Their slogan is \"have it your way\", so why is that me, as a customer, asking for the fries to be cooked longer is mocked by the manager? DO YOU THINK WE CAN'T HEAR YOU? Additionally, please know that just because a person looks a certain ethnicity doesn't mean we don't understand Spanish ;)   The floors are almost always sticky. The trash usually overflows. It's just horribly ran."}
{"text":"CHICKEN KNUCKLES aka CHICKEN FINGERS are always burnt or cold. The first week advertised was the only time the order was right. The food always taste like it's sitting underneath a hot lamp. Their buffalo chicken tenders are never prepared the same way whenever you order. No continuity of service. Piss-poor!!!"}
{"text":"I always used to love this place because it was fast and good but today I ordered 2 croissants and one of them had a long black hair in it. I'm disappointed because I liked going here but I defiantly won't go back now. Disgusting"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly but they are not that helpful. Wanted 2 for 5 deal they had on the window. Couldn't order what I wanted because the cashier couldn't find it. Was told by the cashier it's not available as the deal even though there are pictures of it on the window.    What!! No napkins in my bag!!!"}
{"text":"Worst ever!   Went at 7:30 on Saturday night.  Fries were completely stale and over salted.  Whopper was dry and had chunks of lettuce.  $18 for  one whopper, one chicken sandwich and 2 large fries.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the dumbest humans on the face of the earth. Ordered 2 whopper jr. And a chicken crisp jr.  Waited 7 minutes in drive thru considering the terrible decision I made to go here.  Get. To the window and the dimwit begins to play 20 questions with me. \"You had a whopper jr. And onion rings.\"  Nope, try again. \"You had the drink.\" Nope. \"What did you have?\" I repeat my order and she confers with the wizard behind the curtain. The brain trust comes to the conclusion that they didn't enter my order in the register.  So big dummy asks me again what I ordered. By this time I said forget it and drove off. I did not hold high hopes that they would have even had my order correct had I waited.  On top of that, it had been another 2 minutes at the window while the dolts tried to figure out the impossible algorithm of fast food drive thru."}
{"text":"Thier burgers are really good here, prices are reasonable for what you get. Sure sometimes they are slow, but that's only due to the fact that they serve a large area and cannot keep up with the intense demand, especially in the evening. Nonetheless, I regularly come here and bring my family for some good food."}
{"text":"BK has some of the best fast food onion rings."}
{"text":"I accidentally ordered more food then I felt like paying for and they were very accommodating for me at the window. They were all super polite about it and got my order right.:)"}
{"text":"The food here is always disgusting. I keep trying to go there and like their food and it's always nasty. I've tried them a handful of times over the last few years and each time I'm disappointed. If I go for breakfast, the croissant sandwich is burned. If I go for lunch, the burger is messy and cold. Fries are mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This is probably the third time that they have forgotten to put something in my bag. The first time I didn't check and I drove all the way home and found out that I was missing a burger. Today I went and I went through the drive thru to order food for my brothers and sister and I had to wait in front of the restaurant....which was just fine. However, I checked the bags when I got them and I did a double check and a triple check. Yep, I was missing a burger....and then I checked my receipt to make sure it was on there. Yep, still missing a burger. I had to get my lazy butt out of the car (hence that is why I was going through the drive thru) and walk inside the store. They were very accommodating and I needed that burger with 3 teenage boys and a growing girl....I needed all the food that I ordered. Overall, food is ok for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Awesome for train enthusiasts. Important - there is NO changing station in the bathroom for infants. There's a train that goes round and round in the center of the room and kids get to push the button to make the train go, however the button is close to the register so kids tend to get in the way of customers who are paying. The seats look brand new and have a train print. There is an outdoor playground, it was raining when we went so I didn't look to see if there was outdoor seating for parents. The food was so so."}
{"text":"Awful awful.  3rd time I've come here and I am done giving chances at this location. Slow wait time and horrible food quality."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would, this place ridiculous.! I have waited a good 30 min for two meals. Their excuse? Understaffed. But I have managed a fast good chain as well with less crew as they have an a busier city and I managed. Guess why they are slow? Because they are all standing around doing nothing.! Rather than doing double the work. They complain that they are understaffed it's bs because of the fact that been there done that. Ur getting paid. There's 4 order that has been waiting for more than 30 min!!! Also when I asked how much longer they ignored me... it's annoying and the place is filthy!"}
{"text":"Unless you order everything \"as is\" and don't make any special requests, your order is bound to get screwed up. The most recent fiasco was when I ordered two bacon cheeseburgers with lettuce and onion only. I received two hamburgers with lettuce and onion...no cheese or bacon. Why would I pay extra for those things just to ask them to remove them? I don't know why I keep giving them chances to redeem themselves because they always let me down."}
{"text":"They get 5 stars for excellent service from Andrew!  Fries were hot and fresh, chicken sandwich was ok...a BK sandwich."}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations wanting late night ice cream.  They had closed the lobby early  to the drive thru we go buy guess what?  They have already broken down the ice cream machine to clean it.  Why not wait the last hour the restaurant is open."}
{"text":"This your typical Burger King fast food joint with their regular brand menu and special offerings. As an occasional junk food eater I've over the years dutifully tried everything on their menu at least once. This is one location that stands out in the general area of very good - in general.  So as to make it easy to gauge each of these eateries, when I do try them, I've devised a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being outright down and dirty nasty, and 5 being the best a fast food joint can be! I gage: cleanliness; service; product quality and consistency; convenience; accessibility; taste and the personnel's attitude and customer service level. This place scores 4.0 of 5. I may come back here and do recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was getting my car serviced on Saturday morning at Ideal Auto so we decided to head on over to Burger King for breakfast.  It was almost 10:30 AM so they were going to stop serving breakfast.  I entered the joint and there were no cashiers to take my order.  I looked to the back of the place and I could see all the workers there talking and working.  I called out \"hello?\" and no one came to the front.  I waited for a minute or two and the manager and cashier arrived with no apology to me waiting.  No smiles or enthusiasm.  What kind of customer service was this?  One that I was not fond of.  I was not impressed.  I ordered a Combo # 5 which was an English Muffin with Egg, Cheese and Sausage along with a small order of hashbrowns and a medium black tea.  Food was ready quite quickly.  Went to my seat and started to eat.  It was not too bad but could have been better.  I found that the sausage meat taste reminded me of the USA McDonald's breakfast sausage meat.  How specific, eh?  Unfortunately, the whole sandwich was really dry.  The hashbrowns were crispy but mega oily and salty which was expected.  I checked the nutritional value of the sandwich and hashbrowns and it came up to a whopping 1480 mg of sodium.  Good God!  Almost at my maximum salt intake in just one sitting.  Thank you BK!  If the customer service and taste of the sandwich was a little bit better I would give this place a higher rating but no this is going to have to do."}
{"text":"Took forever to get my order and then they mess it up. It's fastfood...really?"}
{"text":"don't bother with this place customer service is just like the food all trash. save the frustration and time. (fair warning!!!!!!!)"}
{"text":"OMG.  First of all the place was dirty.  Got our cups to get the drinks and there was no ice and also there was no catsup in the dispenser.  I told the person behind the counter and he didn't seem to be in any hurry to fill the ice dispenser.  Still waiting on our food, I asked the girl working behind the counter how much longer on our food.  All she said was I don't know.  Not helpful at all.  Finally the guy behind the counter got us ice from the drive through. It seemed the two employees seem not be care at all."}
{"text":"This place is the worst place to stop. I advise you to eat at your own risk. And everyone that works there have the worst attitude ever. Other people will gladly take that job off your hands. People don't realize them homeless people that's around that store probably can do the job better. Smh corporate should do a pop up and see this place."}
{"text":"This BK is located over in Terminal E of Charlotte-Douglas International Airport - not to be confused with the BK located in the Main Atrium.  I ordered a sausage, egg, and cheese Croissan'wich® and medium hash browns.  Food came up quickly - I sat in the seating area adjacent to the BK - the sandwich was disappointingly luke warm - the hash browns were crispy and hot.  C'mon guys - how hard is it to make your food hot! The hash browns rescued this from being a one or two star review."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner earlier this week. Ordered the classic chicken sandwich - add onions and cheese, extra mayo, an order of onion rings, and a bottle of water.  Sandwich was made to order. I asked to have them make sure the cheese was melted on the sammich - which they did. Sandwich and onion rings were hot and tasty - rings were nice and crispy.  Service was good!  #BurgerKing #BK"}
{"text":"Driving up I-71 North from Hebron, KY to Cleveland, OH - you don't have many options for food along the interstate. Lots of repeats of fast food joints.  Hunger finally overcame us and we opted for BK over McDonald's, DQ, and a couple of others.  I ordered a Double Whopper with Cheese (no bun) add mustard, and a medium order of onion rings and a bottle of water.  Burger was served in a small plastic tray. Was decent enough. Rings were hot and crispy. Food came up reasonably fast. Service was friendly. Dining area was clean."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner one evening.  Ordered a Double Whopper with Cheese, an order of onion rings, and a bottle of water.  Food was made to order and came up hot and tasty! I devoured the whole shebang in minutes!  #BurgerKing #BK #HaveItYourWay"}
{"text":"BK is always my favorite fast food joint. Had lunch here before catching my flight to Denver.  I ordered the BK Big Fish sandwich - with cheese and onions added. For some reason the BK Big Fish was not listed on the menu - so I asked first.  They had three cashiers working the line and they were moving it quickly. And the expediter was cranking out the food to hungry customers rapid-fire.  The sandwich must have just come out of the fryer, Hot, crisp, cheese was melted, and oh so damn tasty!"}
{"text":"I've tried this location a few times, but have never gone inside until tonight.   Upon arriving, the drive thru wasn't open, so looking like a hobo inside will do. The service was great actually and the food was yummy as always.   I took a star off because of the inconvenience of the drive thru being closed, their receipt machine being down, and their ketchup dispenser being out of order. Why isn't anything working tonight?! Lol"}
{"text":"I arrive at the stores Drive Thru at 5:55am call the store and immediately I feel like I'm at Rocky Point or something, I don't speak Spanish. That alone kinda threw me for a loop, they finally took my order at 6:01am and the only good thing that happened on this breakfast run was they knew what a Loaded Croissanwich was. I was surprised, when I got to work and opened it I was surprised again that any employee of Burger King would serve this to a customer, TWO THUMBS DOWN Burger King!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had great service here today. I stopped in for a snack before I went to the grocery store and the cashier was very attentive. She noticed me waiting for the bathroom as another employee cleaned it, and she paged in and let him know. He held the door for me. I appreciate that both employees went above and beyond in the little things. After, I got my onion ring snack and they were crispy and hot."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off. I got the number 1 with cheese. I asked for extra pickles. There were 2. I paid the dollar for large. The frys box was only about half full. So I really got the amount of a small. All this was $8.42. It made me remember why I go to 5 Guys. I mean if I am going to spend that much for crap I rather spend a few more for good. Add the amazingly long wait stuck in the drive thru and you have the perfect experience of a company that gave up caring a long time ago! Pathetic is the only word that came to mind."}
{"text":"Not big on flame broiled but we were in the area and needed something to hold us until dinner time. The food is pretty consistent, dry patties, soggy lettuce... My favorite part is the little bit of onion that they have in it lol.  For the most part, it was pretty clean. It's a pretty small dining area but if you're in and out, I guess it's ok :)"}
{"text":"I will not return to this burger king Ever! Being new you would think they would have a higher standard. The forgot the fries with the meal order. When the fries did come they tasted like they were cooked the day before, luke warm  stale and card board texture! The two sandwiches I ordered were not much better, they tasted as if they cam from a am pm connivence store! Very disappointed with this location. I wont be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped over here to get burgers to take over to 16 Bit across the street.  Peeps working were nice.  They took coupon no problem. Didn't give me the runs so I have that goin' for me.  Place is a little worn and old school.  Reminds me of junior high and mackin chicks at the one in Parma.  Now I cant get the De la Soul song of of my head \"Baby's in the BK Louge\"...."}
{"text":"Slowwwwww as hell.  Seems somwhat clean.  Get my order right most of the time..lol.  Staff seems like they are never in a rush..and with only a half hr for lunch..I AM!"}
{"text":"Have gone to this BK many times over the years and only minor issues. The last month or so nothing but issues. Can't get the correct food. When you approach them about it you get attitude. Just not friendly at all. Even filled out the survey and requested a call back about 3 weeks ago and nothing to this day. Terrible!"}
{"text":"Don't think I'll be going here again. My fries were soggy and almost raw and my \"premium\" chicken sandwich (#6) was disgusting. I took two bites and trashed it. I don't expect much from fast food but this was just gross."}
{"text":"Yuck! I hate fast food chains. My boss was craving fries and this was the closest stop. We ordered to-go for 12 people, so we knew it was going to be a little bit of a wait. The employees were very friendly and patient with our large order, so kudos to them! Within 10 minutes, our food was ready. I was actually surprised that they got our $90 order all correct. Only thing missing was ketchup. Everyone enjoyed their food, but then again, they weren't picky eaters. As for myself, I struggled to finish my grilled chicken sandwich. The chicken was rubbery and the whole sandwich was so bland. I had to pour honey mustard over it just to make it edible. Ugh, can't believe I ate this garbage when I was younger."}
{"text":"I was there was a zero rating because this location is TRASH!! Today I ordered some French toast sticks and they were gawd awful hard like they were sat out all day and reheated. Every time I ordered a burger it was cold, cheese wasn't melted. I love BK but definitely not this location."}
{"text":"It's Burger King. Slooooow service. Cheese burger  ( CHEESE NOT MELTED). I do like the soda machine and the tv's. But if you have to use the bathroom forget it it seems like someone is always in there.."}
{"text":"I am so glad this location closed. Worst burger King I ever went to. Always ALWAYS got our order wrong, even the 2nd time.  Managers were always douches."}
{"text":"I went there today and the play area was a lot cooler and I did sit in there with my kids.  The biggest plus for me was all the condiments that were out in the area where customers could freely take what they wanted and that included ranch dressing.  I was disappointed that they took the couches out of the back area next to the kids play room.  The food was good, the water must have been filtered because it was good as well!  I do miss the jungle gym for my kids that used to be at this burger king which they took out a couple of years ago.  For that reason, I do not go here very often."}
{"text":"Tried this place a handful of times  and each time was disappointing. The burgers are dry barely any  ketchup or mayo. Frys on the cold side! I have been to multiple locations and never had this problem."}
{"text":"very bad service. since no other fast food center near, forcefully we have went there,  pls pls avoid."}
{"text":"i'm giving 3 stars because while they are friendly, i Always have to pull around and wait for my order no matter what it is. and usually there is someone waiting by the trash can in their car and holding up the line, because they didn't understand they need to pull around to wait. anyway, my order is always wrong as well, even when they repeat it back correctly. you ask for cheese, you'll get no cheese, you ask to only have certain veggies on your burger, they put everything on it. i only go to this bk because it's real close to the house. and what's with only putting 5 pieces of ice in the pop??? i should deduct a star just for that because when pop starts to warm up it's nasty, but i won't."}
{"text":"Its BK, what can I say?!  My son and I love coming here on a hot day after the library!! Here its a little hidden, but once you get here its super nice and air conditioned! We've been here a few times and each time its been pretty swell!   The wait is usually short bc its not always busy, the cashiers are pretty nice also, except one of the weirdos who told the manager she wasnt going to refill the ice in the machine.  The prices here are comparable, although I dont usually eat the burgers I do sometimes like the onion rings. What I really come here for, in addition to the kids meals, are the fruit smoothies and sundaes! The ice cream here is seriously sooooooooo yummy! And its only 1$ for a sundae! The mango smoothies are also super yummy and are 2$ and change!  My son loves the kids meals here, they include your entree but what he loves most is the paper crown attached.  They also usually have some pretty neat childrens toys.  So we will def continue coming here for the cheap eats, and nice cooled play area!"}
{"text":"Ahh BK, how lovely.  This BK is pretty close to my apartment. Its kinda hidden behind trees and such, but its next to Outback Steak House. My son had been asking for one of their crowns so on our way home from the library we stopped in.  Walking in its nice, it has one of then things to follow so you can stand in a formed line, the menu is big... but the value menu is to the left and a lil small.... great marketing BK! Lol. Today we got a chicken tenders kids meal and a double cheeseburger combo.  The kids meal was cute, it comes in a box with a crown attached and your choice of chicken tenders, cheeseburger, or regular burger. Plus you get the standard fries and a drink. I got the double cheeseburger meal with the ice cream sundae. At first I was like a little iffy, Im not super into fast food but this one was yummy! The new fries they have are thick and crispy and have a good amount of salt. Now I usually like my stuff salted and this was perfect! I really like the self serve drinks and ketchup, I feel like Im not wasting when I use the ketchup dispenser. I tried all my food and it was delish! I then tried my ice cream and was in love!! ITS SOOO RICH AND CREAMY! For BK this is awesome! I loved it!   We found a seat in the play place which was pretty large and had a ton of seats... most of all it was CLEAN! Yay! My son enjoyed himself very much in there! It doesnt get too crowded when theres a lot of children and its temp is cool in there!  The only gripe I had is one of the workers was being a beezy bc the manager asked her to refill the ice machine... she was totally not having it! All in all this place is A-OK with me!"}
{"text":"Ok, BK, really? Now Im not one of those little food snobs, and Im a cheap beezy so after paying outta my butt for my car here is where I came for a little treat!  I only came for a ice cream sundae after Savers, and I went through the drive through. Now they recently remodeled this place, and its like stupid the way they put the exit right by the exit onto Lake Mead. You would think they wouldve made the opening big enough to enter AND exit, alas there is a sign to not turn into the drive thru... OK? SOOOOO if youre going to try and enter after leaving Chase, Savers, or any of those places you technically are supposed to go all the way around to enter. I was like wtf? and just went through anyway bc I had already pulled half way in. So I proceed to order my ice creams and the guy was ok, not amazing or super nice just ok. Service was quick but he gave me a dumb look when I asked him for a cup holder for 3 sundaes and a cup of water... hello bro! I dont have 4 cup holders!   Anywho ice cream was yummy as usual and service was semi quick, not bad, just a weird drive thru entrance, and a huge slope going down the drive thru.. haha. Ill probs come back, I do love their 1$ sundaes!"}
{"text":"Beware of the mouth breather at the drive-through! I've never seen someone mess up an order so many times in my life in the matter of minutes!"}
{"text":"Yuk. not very tasty at all. only good point was that the counter guy caught that they had missed the bacon (if you can call it that) on hubby's burger."}
{"text":"I go there only cause of Mary. She always says hi to my children and makes us feel welcome every time."}
{"text":"Worst BK I've ever been to. That may not sound so serious considering its a fast food place but its terrible even by fast food standards. Orders take at least 10 minutes to complete and 25 percent of the time they come out wrong. I don't know how but their burgers are the worst, dry and tasteless. Aren't these food products supposed to be foolproof? I thought the renovation would've brought new employees and better service but this shiny apple is rotten inside. Never again."}
{"text":"They remodeled this location.  The inside is big, clean and cool.  Really like the tall seating, although I know others disagree. Food was fast and service was friendly.  The drive thru is also normally pretty quick.  Love the door handles, which are grill tools!  You can always smell the food on the grill and you can taste it in the food."}
{"text":"Way too pricey for the chain. I realize I'm stuck at the airport, but the combos are $1-2 more expensive than anywhere else. I'd hate to wait in line if they were very busy aswell. Otherwise, the food is what you expect."}
{"text":"I originally went through the drive thru, but saw that there were coupon deals if I sownloaded the BK app.  I drove around and came in while I waited for it to finish installing in my phone, and then I had to register on the App... (annoyed, but whatever!)  \"Felipe\" was kind enough to help my husband and I find a deal for two Whopper meals, which was not in the app.  But after, I paid I realized that he did NOT upsell us anything, ask which sides we wanted, or even offer desserts.  I actually hate that at fast food places, but I know its their job to do, so I still expect it.  We got stale fries, and had to pay seperately for an order of Satisfries because he said that there would have been a difference in price on our other order and since the transaction was completed he could just make the substitution.  Wasn't he supposed to ask us about that before??    I could go on, but my husband is just ready to get out of here, but saved yourself DO NOT try the 4 cheese whopper!!!  Tasted like canned cheese from a ball park snack shack!!"}
{"text":"MOOKIE, if that's even her legitimate name, she's an assistant manager here. Was extremely unprofessional & rude. 8/16/17 5:30pm.  We reached the second window to collect our order when we decided to add to our order. The employee was understanding & rang us up right away. The assistant manager opened the window and proceeded to yell at us telling us that next time we need to order from the speaker box. We had no problem jumping back in line but her approach was highly unacceptable. We stayed at the window to ask for cooperates number, with her demeanor we started recording, she continued to be rude and say she didn't have cooperates number, she got off at midnight if we wanted to handle this a diff way. Tried saying she was trying to explain the ordering process once she saw us recording but that is definitely NOT what she was doing. We ended up looking up cooperates number and filing a formal complaint. But this is beyond a negative review for this place.  On top of the \"assistant manager and her professionalism\" she was very disrespectful to the employee at the window, yelling at him with her hands flying everywhere and neck rolling in front of customers.  Just looked at other reviews for this location and it's hard to see why they haven't terminated such a person working in customer service. Something she lacks 100%."}
{"text":"I have been sitting in the drive thru for over 10 minutes. I sat at the order menu for 5 minutes until I had my order taken ( that should have been my clue).  I have never waited this long in a \"fast food\" line. Sooo terrible! Do not come here!! Unless you want to have your patience tested. Why? Who runs this POS Burger King? I ordered my food at 2:53 and i am still in line and it's 3:23!? No lie!! Is there a point when food is free? Or at least discounted? If I owned this franchise I would be ashamed and embarrassed. I have to meditate not to start screaming."}
{"text":"Service was ok, but food was lousy. The breakfast sandwich was cold so I took it back, they gave me another one that was lukewarm. I took two bites and threw it away and left."}
{"text":"A year ago I had 6 bristles on my burger - got some lame standard apologetic email from them. Waited 9 months and went to give them another chance - meat was burned, sandwich was cold and to top it off there was plastic in my ice cream... I will never eat anything from here again !!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly server/manager. They didn't have fresh coffee so he gave me a free drink. It's not that I like the free drink so much but just feel happy when he offered."}
{"text":"military discount keeps me coming back...superb service, internet, power plugs at window tables."}
{"text":"Meh meh.  No senior or military discount.  Messed up order, but fixed it right away.  Had to pester drive in crew person for ice tea. I even moved the tea jug to the counter, they didn't notice.   Food was standard, fries were hot.   Clean floors and sketchy parking lot people."}
{"text":"Drive thru closed but nothing to indicate that.  Then staff says not to yell about it.  Absolutely disgusting place.  Needs to have franchise yanked."}
{"text":"Just arrive at the airport and went to burger king. Got yell at for server mistake. Very Bad and rude customer service.... First time at burger king and last!...."}
{"text":"I was looking around for a fast place to get a bit to eat so I saw burger king... Plus I had a coupon for 2 whoopers and 2 small fries for $4.99 so I decided to give it a try. I enter to find no one at the counter I stood there for about 5 minutes before anyone came to wait on me... Someone finally came to the front and said how can I help you? I handed her the coupon and said I will have this... Ok cheese is extra I said that's fine that will be $14.27 I was like what that must be some expensive cheese. She says opps forgot to use the coupon I will give you cash back I said cool... So now I have to wait till she trys to figure out how much money to give me back with a super puzzled look she hands me back 1 dollar and 5 dimes... That his point I think I am in another world lol... I said you charged me $14.27 she says oh yeah at this point I am watching mind shut down the manager comes over at this point and try's to fix it I had keep the $1.50 on the counter I slid it back and said you take this money back and just redo it. So after all that she hands me back $7.10 I not even sure if that right lol... Plus there was a random hamburger in my bag looks like another fun Burger King adventure... I will not be back anytime soon or maybe I will your now entering the \"Burger Zone\" where people are over charged and random burgers appear in your bag."}
{"text":"1 Star  I've got some good news, and some bad news. The bad news is that the soda fountain was broken (so I couldnt get my cup of water), the service was the slowest I've seen at a BK, and the Jr. Whopper tasted like sh**. The good news is that it'll probably be a long time before I go back to BK so I won't get fat as fast."}
{"text":"1 Star  Most of the employees had a great attitude.......not the one that was taking my order though. She wasn't bad, just not friendly. Ordered my food.......really overpriced. Got my whopper jr. and it was tiny!!! it was more like a whopper preemee. smaller than a mcdonald's burger! Patty was a lot thinner than usual, and it tasted bad......next time i'm flying on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Very poor experience tonight. Thought I'd stop in and try the grill dogs they've been hyping on tv. My classic hot dog was cold. I returned my chilli cheese dog as it was also cold. The cheese wasn't even melted. I spoke with the manager, get this, they aren't grilled. Neither of mine had grill marks. The manager said they are broiled and the microwaved (not too carefully, apparently) before serving. Can you say meat thermometer? Hoping I don't get ill. Pass this one by."}
{"text":"This place has terrible service and worse food. Complain about anything and you don't get a receipt so you can't complain. On a previous visit they were out of French fries and day before yesterday they were out of patties for all the large beef sandwiches, you know, like a Whopper? Don't know who owns this place but your employees don't give a darn and your managers are covering up. I've never used this word before in a review, but sux is not too strong."}
{"text":"This is literally the worse burgerking in the valley. i've recieved 1 good tasting order from here over the last two years. This place is reserved for i have no time at work to get something real to eat or i don't have time to drive to another burgerking. everything is usually sloppily prepared. Almost all my orders are messed up. ( my reason for finally posting today) and the place has a dirty kitchen with a team that looks like they hate their lives. (i don't blame them).   This burger king is the absolute worse. If you're in the area, keep driving and visit a different location. I promise the food will taste better also."}
{"text":"Went here at 1130am, so I figured they would be prepared for lunch time. I was literally the only person in the drive-thru, and it still took ten minutes to get my food. Half my fries tasted fresh and half were extremely stale. My burger was good and the woman working apologized for my wait, but definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"There's only two Burger King locations I go to often, this one and the one on West Springfield in Champaign. This one is slower than the Champaign location but the food comes out much better. I've had both good and bad experiences here so it's hit or miss on the service and quality."}
{"text":"The food at this Burger King is better than most of the fast food locations in the area. The workers are very friendly and fast but they need to focus on cleaning. The floor could have used a good mopping when we came in, not a very warm welcome when you walk into a dirty place."}
{"text":"After a very bad visit at the McDonald's down the street, this Burger King location was great!  We were greeted when we entered. An employee said she was new and it was her 3rd day so she hadn't learned the entire computer yet when we asked to make some changes or our order. She was very sweet and knew how to move quickly in this type of situation.  While we waited for our order we noticed a lot of drinks we out of order in the soda machine. We decided on another choice but a lady who was in the area immediately went and added more.  Our food was done fast, hot and tasted fresh. We've had a few bad experiences with other locations in FL which stopped us from eating at Burger King for a long time. We were so impressed with the food at this location, we went back for breakfast the next day!"}
{"text":"I always come early morning around 2-3am, and the drive thru clerk, JUDE always gets our order correct and is fast and efficient. Keep up the great work! Us customers appreciate your great service and we will continue to give this location our business :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this location few times, and 1/3 of the times they forget something. Ive had it at this location. Might just stop B.K. entirely. Not only did the rep had to repeat the order 3 or 4 times on the microphone, messed it up at the window, waited 10 mins before being asked to park at the front. Waiting another 10 minutes, no apologies for major delay. Then I get home to realize order on onion rings missing after repeating it 3x, then to open Whopper w/ Cheese, but no cheese and double side same bun. So I tried to called the location 3x, no pick up, no manager. Contacted the Burger King Corporate, still nothing 48 hrs later. I wont worry about horrible service, sad case of people that can't take a simple order and have it delivered in timely fashion.. Guess Fast Food isn't so fast any more.  This place has officially lost all my business."}
{"text":"This place does not even deserve 1 star. The spicy crispy chicken sandwich I ordered looked like it was a week old. The chicken was 2 different colors, dark brown on the outer part and light brown in the middle, WTF? The lettuce was green/brown and the tomato looked dehydrated, again like it was left out for days. So I attempted to call the store, and the option 4 to speak to a manager is completely useless just like this whole entire place. I got a busy signal every time I called!! Not sure why that option is even available when you can't even speak to a live person. I am so upset, not because of the money I wasted, but because this establishment and their employees think it is ok to serve people food of this quality. I am pregnant and I ordered food for my husband and children here.... BURGER KING, you are providing potentially hazardous food to your customers; babies, children, pregnant women, the elderly, EVERYONE that goes to your restaurant. Seems like the franchise owners don't give a damn otherwise this never would have happened in the first place. And yes, you get what you pay for, but this is an embarrassment and a joke at its finest. Obviously, I did not eat my burger and it is sitting in the trash where it belongs."}
{"text":"This Burger King is the worst BK I have ever encountered, unfortunately it is the one near my house. When they first opened it was a disaster, and there has been no improvement yet!  When you walk in, there may or may not be anyone at the counter, the old gal that is normally working is more likely to argue with you than take your order.   They seem to have no training when compared to the local McDonalds."}
{"text":"I went through drive thru today and omg I was mad my bf ordered there double whopper and fries and all meal was straight I went to order lady didn't acknowledge me until he said u get that she's like ya pull around ..so we pull around ..they gave us our shakes didn't think to look thought I give the benefit of doubt ..I'm in a cab to so I wait til I get home open the bag...to see all his meal and mine just the onion rings and a chili dog that I never ordered .I ordered a Philly steak sandwich meal  ...I'm like seriously and we already home...to..omg this to much and it don't even look appealing...never again"}
{"text":"I came here to eat lunch. Afterward I went in the bathroom to wash my hands. There was no soap. I told them about it. Came back the next day and was shocked to see that there still was no soap. GROSS!!!"}
{"text":"The D terminal at McCarran Interanational airport is pretty new. You have to take the little shuttle train to get out there, and after that, you have to walk out toward a big atrium and go up a 2 story escalator..  Of course you have to pass some ubiquitous slot machines on the way to your gate. This is mostly a United Airlines terminal.   It isn't a shopping mall like the main terminal is, but it is less crowded and congested, wnd clean.   This Burger King is one of the choices you have to eat out here. There are the usual fast food airport  suspects serving, well, fast food, so  this is as good as any.   We have over the past 10 years  traded in airline food for terminal fast food, what with the airlines competing on price and still losing money. And we are spending more time in the terminal than in the plane. Not sure which is better or worse. At least in the terminal, you have a choice of more than chicken or pasta."}
{"text":"Ok, I don't normally review fast food places cause they are typically sad & u expect the worst but this location really stood out as possibly the worst in the country. Sadly twice within the past week or so I tried to order 2 hotdogs w/mustard & onions only, seems simple enough right? Yeah, that's what I thought but the 1st time I got just ketchup n mustard only. The 2nd time never happened. Why u ask? Well because after waitin for about 10 min after I paid I was asked to pull out front and wait longer cause they just \"dropped\" my hotdogs(whatever that means). How long or how hard is it to make a hot dog to order?!?!?!?!. Here it's apparently pretty difficult. Sure hope the owner reads these cause this is pathetic"}
{"text":"Well, pretty bad!! Fries oversalted and weirdly warm almost cold. They had us drive around the front to have us wait for our food, but tried to give us our pies which are supposed to stay cold! After discovering that the other four cars out front were waiting as well, I decided to go in and get mine to discover about 6 employees doing, well, nothing. Won't be going back, peace out!"}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible! Three employees standing there looking at me as I'm waiting for one of them to take my order. Another employee is engaged in a conversation with a customer instead of working. The lady mopping the floor isn't doing anything but spreading a sticky mess across the floor.  An off duty employee comes in and orders the same exact thing I did 10 minutes after me. 2 minutes later she has her food while I'm still waiting. Customer after customer come in and order food after me, some orders even bigger and more complicated than mine who received their order well before me. 15 minutes later I received my small order of hash browns and croissant. Smh...."}
{"text":"This location is always out of of stuff! They put up a sign saying they only have certain things available. When we ordered off that menu, all we got was just more bullshit of what they don't have! We get to the window to see all kinds of things they allegedly didn't have being made! Lazy ass workers who are just cutting corners. Whatever we won't come back here again. 3 times now these fools have pulled this stunt!"}
{"text":"The way they run this burger king is so inefficient with the cafeteria line style of getting your food. With having to carry your bags with you everywhere, it made it very difficult. Can ya'll just do it the normal way?"}
{"text":"Very good food. However needs a better smelling area. Whenever I go here it smells of chemicals. And smelling that and trying to eat a nice juicy burger isn't very pleasant. Either wait till the end of the day to clean or get better cleaning supplies. It's a good place to eat if your in the area and need food at that very second. Fries are very good however the burgers are not so much. They do make pretty good milkshakes. So really this place should just turn into a fries and milkshake kind of diner. It'd be better than what they have now."}
{"text":"I have only used the drive-thru  but love this Burger king the staff are alway fast and friendly"}
{"text":"I don't go to BK that much,  but I've never had an issue with the service at this location.  No one has ever forgotten my food at the drive thru,  and all the employees seem competent and nice enough.     On this trip,  I didn't order my usual Whopper with cheese,  I decided to branch out and try the Big King.   I know it's BK's attempt to copy the Big Mac,  but eating it just left me wanting a Big Mac.   Oh,  I'm sure if you had never tried a Big Mac before,  it would probably taste perfectly fine, it was a decent fast food  burger.   But for someone like me who loved them as a kid,  it just wasn't the same.   Next time,  I'm sticking with the Whopper with cheese... Then I won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Fred is gonna go far that man has amazing and I mean amazing customer service skills you forget your at a Burger King he makes this place seem like a five star restaurant"}
{"text":"This \"restaurant\" never gets my order correct.  This morning, I ordered two bacon croissantwiches and got one bacon and one sausage.  What a load of shit!"}
{"text":"I ordered a fried chicken sandwich and the meat in the center of the patty was pink and slimy, as in raw.  DANGEROUS"}
{"text":"Ok so it's a Burger King, so you know what you are getting. This one is clean and has a great staff. So if you are in the strip mall shopping, stop on in for a snack or meal. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"I asked them to warm up my burger, because they are always cold. She said it was made fresh because they are slow. The burgers were still cold. Yuk"}
{"text":"Daughter decided to get the French toast sticks for breakfast when we were returning back from New Orleans to L.A. Lines were long but moved fast. The manager serving the food bags was nice and smiling all the time. Since it was breakfast hours they did not serve any lunch or dinner menu items which is what I wanted for my tummy. Lots of seating outside. Prices as in most airports were exhorbitant."}
{"text":"The food is always stale and old never good quality or fresh. Unnecessary attitude because they can't understand a simple request. So much for \"have it your way\" right. Just save your money and use it to feed you and your family somewhere more worthy."}
{"text":"The one star is for the fact that person working drive thru is always friendly. HOWEVER every single time I go and order a chicken club salad it NEVER has bacon in it. These salads are pre packaged so either someone don't know wtf they're doing or this location is purposely ripping ppl off. Paying almost $7 for a half a** salad is not ok."}
{"text":"Ate inside for the first time in a long while. Usually, it's To Go.   Ordered the Whopper combo, no upsizing. The cashier was friendly, paid him and he noticed I had a coin, which looked like a quarter, but was from United Arab Republic. He asked if I had another coin, I didn't so I was going to take my change back and give him a dollar. But he said 'Don't worry about it and took the coins.  The Whopper was hot off the grill and so was the french fries. I wish the fries were a bit thinner like In & Out's. But, I have to remember we are at Burger King. My meal was satisfying and I'll be back."}
{"text":"This location has been around for a long time and when it comes to fast food chains I've liked Burger King over other chains, but it seems like things are going down as they try to \"keep up\" with competing chains. I tried the new \"king\" I guess it is their big mac, but the middle piece of bread was hard and chewy...and I think still slightly frozen, it was discussing. Other than that everything is average. I used to like their chicken tenders, but they changed those to mock McDonald's as well and I'm just not a fan any more. But the staff here is always friendly!"}
{"text":"We really like the two for $6 deal. Whoppers are some of the best. Can't beat flame broiled. Well, you can but not 2 for $6."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!!   We just went to the drive-thru at this Burger King and the girl (Ashley) was so rude. We started to place our order and immediately she cuts us off and doesn't listen. We had to pull up to the window to place the order. Once we got to the window, she huffed and puffed the whole time and threw us attitude. Our order was thrown into the bag, the burgers were spilled out of the wrappers and the onion rings weren't even full. Both orders were half empty. Once we got home, we called back and asked for a manager. Whoever answered the phone wouldn't tell us who they were and hung up on us. They then called us back to harass us and blame us for the hang up.   I will never go back to this location. Calls have been put into the corporate office. Will update once we see what they are going to do."}
{"text":"Usually fast food franchises take great care to make sure their locations all offer the same value and service.  This location however slips through the cracks.  In three tries, the same lady has messed up my order.  In each visit she blamed being new.  Perhaps staff should be fully trained in their duties before jockeying the register.  In terms of speed, you will not find it here.  Expect a long wait inside or at the window.  I could could go on about the cleanliness, but why bother.  They aren't the most accurate, fastest or cleanest, but they can take your money!"}
{"text":"By far the worst fast food service I have ever received... They were extremely slow and got my order all wrong. My husband and I have been coming for years. I was shocked to see one of the managers named Lauren  wrote her number on one of the receipts when my husband took our kids to eat. I hope they find better employees."}
{"text":"The customer service at the front was VERY polite, I think her name was Gina. Would visit just to speak with her again. Food was retarded, but hey it's Burger King what did you expect."}
{"text":"I like BK, but this one was gross!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped going to this Burger King cause of the rude, ghetto, unbelievably bad customer service at drive thru... gave them 3 chances and stopped going.  Tonight decided to try again due to a craving of their original chicken sandwich.  The lady working drive thru was great.  Her voice itself was like no other I've ever come across at this location... you could hear the smile in her voice, she was very polite and patient.  Even when i pulled up to the window, she greeted me with a huge smile and warm hello.  My order was going to take a few minute so she politely asked me to pull up front and my food would be out shortly.  Not even 5 minutes later, a gentleman came out with my food, thanked me for waiting and wished me a great evening.  While checking my order, i overheard him go to a lther car and explain their food will be out shortly cause one of their items takes a little bit to prepare and he thanked them for being patient.  I wish i got both their names so i could send a message to their corporate offices... maybe I'll go back one day and get it.  5 stars for the great customer service..."}
{"text":"Decent Burger King, no better, nor worse than 90% of BK's.  Clean bathrooms and well placed on our LV-PHX route."}
{"text":"The one in Terminal 2 is your regular burger king with regular prices.  Pretty much the only choice in T-2 with attached Pizza Hut.  Have tried the T1 BK in the Delta gate area.  All in all better than average BK's with normal prices.  Good Veggie burger is a plus too.  5 visits and all good items at T2 anyway.  1 visit at T1 and if was ok."}
{"text":"shitty. I went here on my break and they said \"we aren't taking orders right now, because we have to finish a big order.\" I used manage a restaurant, and I've cooked for 4 years, that's ridiculous. manage your team and don't be lazt"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Waited in drive thru line for 19 mins and you can't even leave the line, I also called to see if there was a reason we were waiting so long in the drive thru and the manager that answered laughed at me! I was only ordering a drink because I would never order food there, EVERYTIME I have in the past it's been incorrectly prepared. I don't think it's strictly the employees problem I think they need better management! And they want $15 Hahahhahahah"}
{"text":"The Manager was nice. The WHOPPERS I had fresher than usual. However very poor cost value ratio. The food is overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Will not be coming back to this location. I have visited this location about 3 times over the past several months and every single time the service has been unprofessional. Customer service is nonexistent at this location. The staff is always irritated at the drive thru window and you wait forever for your food. I have arrived home to find food I paid for missing in 2 of the 3 occasions I visited and on our most recent visit we had to throw all the food we bought away because it was absolutely disgusting (cold fries even though it takes less than 5 minutes to drive home and burgers with mushy tomatoes like paste and wilted, slimy lettuce). Not to mention I ordered chicken nuggets and they first said no sauce comes with the chicken nuggets ... Huh? When I called to politely explain that my order had been incorrect, the manager Tiffany was unhelpful and even questioned my integrity. Hope this dump gets closed down!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to get a bite to eat.  I chose this place because there weren't any other fast food places around for miles.   Hot and fresh fast food.  This Burger King is attached to a gas station and it does have ample seating. They have some current deals of getting two burgers for five dollars. Price is good.  Food was not too fast. I was not in a hurry and didn't mind. As my sandwiches were fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Very rude when it's gets close to closing time. They yelled at customers who tried to get in line after they announced they were closing. Service was very slow. Poor attitudes all around."}
{"text":"How has this place been re opened for less than 2 months and your shake machine is down? Is it just typical stupidity or laziness? What's the point in a restaurant serving something if they never have it? Worthless"}
{"text":"I got there a few minutes after they opened, and (after repeating myself 3 times) placed my order at the drive-thru. There were 2 cars ahead of me, but very little delay. You would think it's obvious that the food was fresh, but still, it was one of the best sausage-egg-cheese biscuits I'd ever had from a BK. Great goin', Sunday morning opening crew."}
{"text":"For some reason they put up offers that they do not have and be rude to you when you scramble to choose something else. Not to mention a double stack is 4x more than a McDouble and it tastes worse. NEVER EAT FOOD HERE, also the manager is a complete douche bag."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Stood at an empty counter for ten minutes while the girls chatted in the back ignoring us . Dinning room was a pig sty pancakes are smaller than any other Burger King I've been to.i will never come back here."}
{"text":"Update: went back again to give one more chance and literally my entire order was messed up and I got no receipt I will be giving corporate a call tonight   Never eat here the staff is extremely rude won't refund your money won't give you a receipt for anything the food is never made right and they barely clean the store"}
{"text":"1st to review? I guess thats really no surprise word gets around that this place is BAD!!  It's been quite awhile since I've been to Burger King mostly because they microwave everything right in front of you ans then tell you it was charbroiled. I was lured in by a co-worker willing to pay and wanting to try the NEW Funnel Cake sticks.  I stay away from the burgers since they are FROZEN patties semi-broiled then microwaved. Not my kind of burger. I do however enjoy an occassional chicken sandwich microwaved or not. I ordered it MY WAY-plain.  The chicken sandwich was ok but the funnel cake sticks were terrible-like a vanilla flavored straw made of straw. I couldnt eat them, neither could my son:(  A place I wont be back to for another long while and thats not even due to the terrible service we experienced taking more than 20 minutes for 3 chicken sandwiches + 2 funnel cake sticks."}
{"text":"The new high tech touch screen drink machine ran out of regular coke and dr. pepper.  Poor planning."}
{"text":"Heard this was one of the best burger king's in the valley but when I ordered the A1 Ultima Bacon Cheeseburger in was very disappointed. It burger came with 3 small strip of \"bacon\", 2 partial pieces of onions and no A1 sauce. Wtf is that crap?"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever !!! The pm manager is the rudest one !! Can this location get 0 stars ?????"}
{"text":"Webt through drive thru for our order.  There was no one there as far as other customers.  We had to repeat our drink orders several times.  When we drive away I took a drink feom my Cherry Coke and about threw up.  It tasted moldy and disgusting.  I called and there was no answer so I left a message and never got a call back.  I believe the drink machine was NOT clean.  Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Witnessed manager demeaning GrubHub employee who had been waiting 15 minutes to pick up the food. She was extremely out of line, loud, and rude. Employees did not even say hello to me or look at me. I waited 15 minutes myself for an order, and struck up a conversation with another customer who had been waiting longer than me for one sandwich. When my food was ready, they didn't even call my number. They just threw it on the counter and walked away, so none of us knew whose it was. I had to dig through to find out it was mine. Asked for ranch, and it was very clear I was inconveniencing them. Never got a smile, \"you're welcome,\" or even a look acknowledging that I'm a human being with money to spend.  The entire staff needs to go through some sort of training and manager needs to be addressed by corporate. Myself, Grubhub guy, and other customer made it known we planned to complain to corporate about manager. I understand you need to wait for food now and then, but their attitude is inexcusable."}
{"text":"This Burger King is nearly right across the street. Since my husband prefers this fast food joint to McDonalds, we do stop here every once in a while. Their food seems consistent and sometimes you have to wait a long time for your stuff, but it's almost always hot and fresh (can fast food be fresh?)   I don't really eat here. I can't stomach most fast food. However, I like that I can get a 20 oz. Coke slushie here for just a buck. That makes me feel better when I have to make a special trip for one of the boys. My kids will eat anything you give them so I can't count on them for an accurate description of taste.   The major reason why I'm writing a review is because of the customer service. A lot of times our food is just plain wrong. A lot more times they make you pull around the front so they can bring it out to you when it's done. We've had to wait upwards of 20 minutes for food before. Granted, it was 10:30pm, so I'll not be taking it too hard on them. 3 Stars because I've not had anything go so wrong as to not be back."}
{"text":"So disappointed today! Usually come here for lunch since it's close to work and quick in the drive-thru. Today, my chicken sandwich was so dry and nasty. I didn't even get half of it down. The soda was also lacking some carbonation, too much syrup! I will be finding a new lunchtime drive-thru as I am not a fan of wasting money or throwing away food. See ya BK!"}
{"text":"Lady at the register wasn't too pleasant which i understand if you work all day and whatnot but what I've learned is you should ALWAYS have a smile on your face no matter what"}
{"text":"Allan at the drive thru was thorough and so friendly. I have a big family and ordered a lot. He repeated my order and double checked it right in front of me before handing it off. Great customer service and food was great as well."}
{"text":"I went to Burger King and I got like $30 worth of food and  when I ask for ranch they only gave me one and when I ask for another one she tried to charge me... like really I spend $30 for just one????  I understand if it was like 5 and one ranch but 30??? Not going to this location anymore.."}
{"text":"No line at the drive thru when I was there. Courteous employees and the food was really good!"}
{"text":"Ordered coke, got root beer. Went back to window and the apathetic, dirty looking woman replies with \"you're not getting anything through this window\". Then they closed 2 hours early. Never coming back."}
{"text":"This is the worst Burger King ever. They take 20 minutes for one burger. And the girl manger is is rude."}
{"text":"Clean place but the food is pretty crappy Ordered the chicken king combo at night and it was sooooooo dry just terrible....the middle bun was hard as rock I had to take it out Onion rings are over breaded and overfried I don't know how this BK is surviving with such terrible food"}
{"text":"Worst experience at any restaurant in CLT, as well as, any Burger King I've visited. Customer service is completely horrible. CLT should close this place up and open something else. That being said...  I travel through CLT almost weekly and have always grabbed lunch at other places, but I flew in on a Saturday morning (8:36 am on 1/20/18 to be exact) and needed breakfast so I decided to grab a sandwich meal at BK. I placed my order and waited for my food. The server yells out numbers but it is hard to understand her as she does it with her back turned in many cases. I did not hear her so my food sat on the counter for a minute. I finally went up and grabbed the bag and asked for ketchup. She looked at me as if I had 3 heads and pointed at the counter where the napkins were housed without one word. She then turned around and walked off.   The food: horrible. The sandwich was a complete mess (not put together well at all) and had no taste. The hash browns were so greasy, I could have strained the greased and put it in the deep fryer to make French fries.   Honestly, I've never been so discgusted with a fast food location; and, seeing the ratings, I'm surprised that BK corporate has not done something at this point. This may prompt me to send a letter to corporate before someone becomes ill from the food...or the bad attitude."}
{"text":"Ok food but terrible service. Earlier today, when we were in there around 5pm or so. The female manager on duty who was tiny and had black hair was very mouthy towards my mother and I. She didn't place any OUT OF ORDER sign on the defective soda fountain machine where the pop spewed out all over me. And then she proceeded to mouth off towards us when we asked for a simple refill and she professed that she fixed the nob the quality was bitter and flat. It took them 20 minutes to prepare our simple order and she didn't tell us that the order was ready. It shouldn't take Burger King 20 minutes to prepare a simple order. That female manager must be reminded of her place when she addresses the paying customer with courtesy and proper service."}
{"text":"One time while I was here while ordering inside, the cashier stopped taking my friends order while he was talking, just to answer her cell phone and spoke for a good 90 seconds.    Even after his jaw dropped, she didn't break character and acted like it wasn't a big deal.  Luckily I don't expect any customer service going here, I just thought that was hysterical when it happened.  Overall though, very consistent, I love the food (well, it's a good value), and they are fast.  No real problems here, A-OK in my book.  Just make sure none of the workers have to make a call or have a call coming in."}
{"text":"Food is fine, customer service at the drive thru was abysmal.  The teenage boy taking our order didn't ask if we were finished ordering after our first item and then just told us the total and asked us to drive to the second window.  When we asked to add more food on at the window, he claimed that he couldn't add on at the window with a snotty attitude.  When we explained that he hadn't given us a chance to finish our order, he begrudgingly did it (indicating he had lied when he told us he couldn't add on at the window).  I don't really expect much from a fast food place but some basic customer service is appreciated."}
{"text":"Service is fast, plus you want to get out of there quickly it's in a ruff part of town! directly across from the projects"}
{"text":"Not one of the better Burger Kings. I go here weekly during the warmer months because it is convenient only. The wait times are long and the food is never warm. Cheese is always cold. Orders are occassionally screwed up. BK is not what it used to be. Precooked and nuked meat not the flame broiled on order, they way it used to be."}
{"text":"I've never really regretted choosing to go to a fast food place, but this particular visit was definitely not the best.  I was actually circling South Park for a place to eat before heading to a meeting so it had to be quick... most of the places in this area are sit-down places and take a while so I stopped in here.  The people were friendly, but it took a long long time to get my food and then I decided to sit down and eat rather than stuff my face and run.  I did overhear a lot of employee conversations about going home and their feet hurting, etc.  I think they were in the middle of a shift change, but it's hard not to hear that stuff when it's being yelled from the cash register back to the kitchen.  Atmosphere aside... the sandwich was dosed in mayo like someone was trying to put out a fire with it.  The fries.... were scalding hot (that's what was the hold up with the food - and also the drive thru line).  They also ran out of ketchup containers so I had to be creative and put ketchup on a napkin in a big blob.  Oh well - get what you pay for though I guess....."}
{"text":"Just got my food at 1126pm even tho my receipt says I paid at 1106pm! This is fast food?! I have ice cream in my groceries that I just bought not realizing I would be sitting waiting for Burger King for 20min!  I am PISS'D! Didn't even get an apology  Also they weren't that busy for me to have to wait 20 minutes when the guy said he's only waiting on the fries- every fast food joint in Vegas sucks ass! I'm gonna tell my friends to quit eating this garbage!"}
{"text":"Aside from being sketchy, they ran out of all dipping sauces...  That level of poor planning is unacceptable at the best of times, but when you know a promotion is coming, come on.  That's amateur.  People don't come here for the charming atmosphere, they come here to have it their way, right away.  One star!"}
{"text":"Order a whooper meal and chicken sandwhich meal .... my chicken was literally a piece of leather and was dark as can be , like it was sitting for over 2 hours . it shouldn't have been served at all ... but fast food employees want a raise ? That's a joke . We tossed it cuz we didn't wanna get sick . Someone should be correcting this"}
{"text":"I can't imagine a fast food restaurant can be this bad.  I went through the drive through, was the only car in line, yet it took forever for the food to arrive.  The fries were cold, they left out the juice in the kids meal, and there was so much mustard slopped all over the burgers they had to be scraped to be edible.  And the woman in the drive through had as much charm as one of their cold fries.  I will gladly drive several more miles to go to Wendy's or Mickey Ds!  This BK is truly a dump!"}
{"text":"Standard greaser but now $10 plus for a breakfast meal.  Airport price gouging accomplishment, congratulations."}
{"text":"i went to burger king not because i am fan, but because when ur hungy, u need sustenance and the nearest food chain is like a taste of heaven. but heaven was not what i found in this place. first thing i did when i got to this place is to check the underside of the table for gum, and holy molly, i cant count how many pieces of gum were stuck in there!!! disgusting! from that moment, everything seems going downhill. i look at my burger, and it looks very delicious. and oh, boy, i was wrong. my burger was rubbery and over cooked!!! fries was oily as hell. and the soda was watered down!!! everything just totally went wrong, and i went home with an empty stomach. well, i guess, the world is conniving to make me go into some weight loss program."}
{"text":"HAHAHAHAHA!!! What a joke! Service was rude through drive thru, it took forever for the girl to get to the window to take payment, and our food was messed up once we arrived home. No employee bothered to answer the phone when we tried calling. The voice recording left information about contacting the district manager. Fries were burnt, onion rings had to have been sitting out for a while, my no pickle/extra onion whopper came out with no onion and a pile of pickles...I can't stand pickles so I couldn't eat it. What a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Ah, Burger King on the base - because there aren't many other options.  Stopped here on a few occassions, typically when I'm on base with family. BK is not high on my list of places I like to patron on the regular, but it will do in certain cases.  Perks - No tax. Shares dining room with Popeyes. Other customers are nice. Dining room well kept and clean.  Cons - Employees seem... A little out of it sometimes? On a recent trip the cheese on my Whopper wasn't even melted. Prep of food could use improvement.  Why go? You're on base and it's convenient. But honestly I'd pick getting sandwiches or sushi at the commissary over BK 99.9% of the time."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating in the dining room listening to a Burger King employee getting reprimanded by their manager. It's probably good etiquette NOT to discuss employee performance, pay, and hours around paying customers."}
{"text":"Burger King is gross. And the food is old and terrible. Close the place down and put in something decent. Summerlin allowed the worst possible choice in their limited fast food restrictions."}
{"text":"No self fill drink station? Shameful!  I know this is Las Vegas, but don't gamble on the power of filling up your own drinks!"}
{"text":"I have to start with admitting I am not a fan of Burger King. It just has never done it for me. My kids and hubby however hound me relentlessly (once in a while) to pick it up for them. I will admit I love their French toast sticks for breakfast. Yummy. I decided however tonight to give them a try since I'd never been to this location. I was pleasantly surprised at the great customer service in the drive thru tonight. I wish I would have gotten her name, but she was smiling and friendly. My experience at previous locations was not the case. I ordered a Bacon King hamburger and it was tasty. It's pretty basic with bacon, cheese, two patties, mustard, ketchup and mayonnaise. I hate mayonnaise but it works. My youngest ordered 10 piece nuggets for 1.49 which is an awesome deal. I also ordered an extra 10 piece because typically he eats a ton lol . Good thing I did because he ate them all. My older son had the 2 spicy chicken sandwiches for $6. My husband loves the double whopper with bacon and cheese. I don't know how he finishes all that. I barely was able to eat just the hamburger I got. Tonight's service and this burger makes me think I might come a bit more often. I'd love if they made something with bbq sauce on their burger....unless they have that and I didn't notice."}
{"text":"I don't usually make a point to yelp fast food places. But this burger Kings bathroom smells like a gas station. I just don't even understand. How can ur bathroom smell so bad that it hits u when u walk in the door. Like shit smells stronger than the food..... like how?  How? How can ur bathroom smell so damn bad that now not only do I not want fries, but I'm not even hungry. I'm just pissed. They could freebreeze or something. Maybe get some stickies. Possible a fan. Or just freakin mop. I'm so pissed."}
{"text":"i would give a no star if i could. they do not pay attention to detail. burgers came out cold after ordered off the broiler and was missing bacon and cheese that i added as exxtra and paid for. pay attention to detail people. is it that freaking hard to make a hamburger with a computer that tells you how to make it??? and your asking for $15 an hour. what a shame"}
{"text":"I think this one is under recent new management and have not quite got it right yet . Onion rings have been either over or under cooked and I just swiped my debit card for twenty something cents so I could get a second zesty sauce . Smh"}
{"text":"This BK is hands down the worst of the worst. The food is atrocious every single time without fail. I just  ordered a classic chicken sandwich meal. Got home, bit into it, and it was so hard I couldn't chew it. I wish I would have attempted to have eaten it while driving so I could have lobbed it right out my window. It doesn't even deserve the space in my trash can at home."}
{"text":"Staff is some what helpful. Food was made correctly and fresh. The soda dispenser needs to be repaired. It is missing some the flavors to make all the drinks. As a whole the resturant was clean but needs to be updated."}
{"text":"This Burger King should be closed down. Service is horrible, food is ALWAYS Awful. I have learned my lesson. McDonald's down the street will be getting my business."}
{"text":"When I looked up this Burger King I was surprised it only had 2 stars! I went to this particular location because they accepted some coupons I received in the mail.  There was a line but the cashier was already taking my order after a few minutes! He was polite and even let me keep the coupons so I could use them again. The food was just as great as the service definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This Burger King is about average, not the best not the worst. A real burger place is much better of course, and other fast food, isn't quite as good. The flame broiled burgers are better then what other fast food has. The dollar menu has a wide selection available, but if you want to fill up, you end up having to buy so many dollar items that you really might as well just buy the burger you wanted to begin with."}
{"text":"Friday January 5 at around 1p I went inside the restaurant to order the crispy chicken sandwich meal. What I got was a longer than expected wait, employees who weren't knowledgeable of their own menu and excuses. The woman in front of me ordered the Rodeo chicken sandwich, but was given a fish sandwich, she told Michelle, the cashier who took her order, Michelle tried to relay that to the cook who responded with he doesn't know how to make that. I watched as Michelle took the fish sandwich from the customer and place it back on the warmer to be served again (EW!) once the cook came out and talked to the customer directly he was able to understand exactly what the woman wanted (Michelle kept saying 'rodeo' in a way that made it hard to understand) I had to wait about 10 minutes to order while being told that they are short staffed and that I would get waited on when she gets to me. My order took about another 10 minutes to get. Food was about warm.  Definitely wont be returning after watching food get handled by a patron and then placed back to be served again instead of thrown away. I get you pay for what you get but geez!"}
{"text":"Burger King has one of the best french fries for fast food places if I do say so myself."}
{"text":"This location has the worst customer service.  I had went to get lunch for my employees and went thru the drive thru. I had ordered some chicken salads and girl at the window told me that they messed up my order and it would be a few. I said, \"no problem\", but she failed to mention they had made chicken wraps instead. I get my food I get back to the shop and the salads looked like left overs (Chicken Wraps thrown in salad bowl). I called them back and Jeremy the Manager was nice and said to hold on to receipt and come in and they will take care of us. I told him I could not go back now and he said that is fine just to let whoever is on shift know that I spoke to him. My wife and I close up shop (same day) and some lady manager seemed sincere, but refused to make things right.  We did not touch the salads and we brought them back in so they can see what was given to us. We all have to understand that these big chains are big enough not to care about their customers. It's sad because there are those stores that are pulling their own weight along with stores like these. Oh yah, that manager on duty did not want to give us our money back, but saw customers behind me and probably did not want to look like an ass."}
{"text":"Ok So I just went here and there was this guy who order no salt on his Fries and the guy in the back . Some guy kid with glasses said to another guy . You know who orders no salt on fries A Holes really dude, first if all I order no salt also , not because I want them like that but because I have high blood pressure and I'm on a low sodium diet.  Get your facts straight idiot."}
{"text":"Food is always hot. The staff are very friendly and service with a smile is a plus.   Drive thru is speedy fast."}
{"text":"Quick fuel picked by the supervisor. Ugh. Noticed there aren't any young teenage workers there, which is weird. Maybe they all are working Christmas who knows.  Well the wait on getting our order took forever.  We were kinda the only people in there. So again I have a problem with breakfast being served past breakfast time.  If you say we can still order hamburgers while the breakfast menu is up please put a full menu up of choices. I notice that Burger king does not have much of a good value menu either. After tasting real burgers at other burger joints a do leave a bit unhappy.  But sometimes you have to do what you have to do to survive, This was not my choice of fuel so it is what it is.  The fries were good though."}
{"text":"Pleasant staff, and for the most part good customer service . And not to mention they serve the regular menu all day. They are really good about getting you in and our and making sure your order is correct."}
{"text":"I just don't understand charging 8 or 9 dollars for a breakfast combo.   At least it's quick and consistent."}
{"text":"I love Burger King but this location always messes up orders. Make sure you double check it before getting home. Out of 5 trips, telling them no Cheese 4 times they put it on."}
{"text":"Service is super slow. Staff is rude. Food sucks. The shake machine is always down 3 or more hours before close. The orders are never right. The staff are always goofing around. They close the store all the time before their posted hours of operation. Getting a smile from soneone there is everything but short of a miracle. I always go to the mcdonalds in town."}
{"text":"I stopped eating at burger king a long time ago, because it seems every time I would eat there for some reason I would get sick.  So I cut ties, well last Thursday I was craving a bbq burger and I didn't want to call one in and wait so I heard that burger king had a new carolina whopper.  So I figured what the heck try it, maybe things are different now even the fries must be better.  So I went and got me a juicy bbq carolina whopper and some nice thick cut fries.  It was soo amazing oh my gosh I wanted to do it all over again.  So since this is what I wanted, I did that Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  So yes I have a stomach full of beef, and I know that's not good, but the burger was so good and the fries oh wow I'm really impressed by this whole meal.  The only thing I didn't like, even though I got it every time was the sprite, it's something about the sprite that was extra, I can't put my finger on it though but over all it was a great whopper experience."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I'd been to Burger King. Since I was hungry and waiting for my gf next door at the dental office anyways I thought I'd give it a shot again. I ordered a bacon egg and cheese croissanwich value meal.  1.  Croissanwich was flat and tiny 2. They forgot the hash browns originally, had to ask where they were. 3. The coffee wasn't ready, they said they'd bring it out. 4. Whole meal was overpriced. 5. No lids for water cup stocked.  6. Coffee took about 20 minutes to come out. Meal was finished-  employee told me he completely forgot.. Just like he forgot the hash browns.  7. No creamers for coffee available.  8. Coffee was the worst I've ever tasted in my life. I'm not exaggerating. Took one sip and was completely disgusted-  ended up throwing it out. 9. Service was very bad and they were apologetic.. But the overly fake, not genuine kind. 10.  Almost forgot, food took long to come out as well.  I'm not going to Burger King again in this lifetime."}
{"text":"Burger king is my old stand by and i live right next to this one. I have to drive 4 miles to the next closest one if i want a whopper. This location is abysmally bad. Fries are always stale and soggy with oil. Meat is undercooked. Lettuce is old. No carbonation in the soda, just flavored sugar water. I dont recall them ever getting my order right. EVERY SINGLE TIME. Friendly staff that couldnt care less about their jobs. Never again. Dirty dining area too."}
{"text":"Never want to burgers king and not have chicken strip but they have it on the menus  runout or they don't stock up on item the service could been better"}
{"text":"This is the worst fast food place I have ever visited. I waited upfront at the register for 5 minutes without any acknowledgement. There was one person in the kitchen during the breakfast rush. Two BK employees were in the lobby talking. One was complaining about being past over for a management role. The other seemed to be visiting from another store. Mary, the assistant manager, was rude, even though I gave her no reason to be so. When I said good morning, it seems you're very busy this morning, she waved her arms a bit and said I'm busy as if to say hurry up and order. Savannah was working the drive through and was rolling. I ended up waiting 10 minutes for 2 kid's meals. A guy named Silas strolled in without any serious desire to get things moving. Another customer had an identical experience. He turned to me and said this is ridiculous. The employee in the lobby eventually went to the back and started helping. Man, I advise you avoid this place! It's ridiculously slow. If you do visit, go through the drive through."}
{"text":"Standard BK shop at the airport but was really slow and it took over 15 minutes to complete our order."}
{"text":"This location is clean. Fast service, and the soft drinks are perfect. Generous on the fries. The burger was a bit weak. This location is NOT a franchise.  That's very important in the burger king world. The franchise locations are never as clean and priced higher."}
{"text":"We ordered November 26th at 330pm . It was empty so they had our food ready fast now I know why it was so fast it was very old . I placed a large order and we had to throw away the chicken fingers they were really old . They must of been low on ink at the register because I couldn't read my receipt . I would recommend driving out of your way to a different burgerking ."}
{"text":"Love Burger King, absolutely will not order from this location again. I've given multiple chances to this location thinking it was a busy day or they may have had staffing issues, but consistently they fail. Food is almost always cold and sloppily put together. We have to go in the opposite direction (further West) of our home if we ever need to order from this restaurant."}
{"text":"So we're bumming it at a friends house tonight cause our AC went out today.. Grabbed a quick dinner at Burger King - ordered three things, but the guy in the drive through just stopped talking. (Um hello?) finally he came back but the onion rings we ordered weren't on the screen. Pulled up to the window, asked about the onion rings, he said yes, PAID FOR MY GOSH DARN ONION RINGS, got back to said friends house - no onion rings. Oh, and no receipt.  Thanks."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would. Went to get breakfast this morning (6:25am) and the asshole on drive thru was completely rude. It doesn't cost a dime to be a nice person. Never coming back to this location. Snotty attitude and what not.  Don't come here!"}
{"text":"Very clean dining room. Did not see the bathroom. Lukewarm onion rings, but it may just be when I got them."}
{"text":"The only place I can think of that consistently gets my order wrong almost every time I choose to go there. Kind of ridiculous."}
{"text":"After I placed my order and pulled up, the girl had the windows open and was re-ringing in my food because she kept messing up. I listened to her loudly complain for a few minutes that it wasn't working right before she took my money. I told her I wanted to pay for the nuggets in cash and the rest on card and had to repeat this a few times, since she seemed confused and offended. I got the feeling after looking at my reciept that she forgot my chicken fries. I asked her about it, reminding her of the coupon I handed her, and got a non-answer. It took several minutes for a guy to trade her positions since she was struggling. He gave me the food. After I pulled out of the drive thru, I checked the bag, and they were in there. They were ice cold. It was like they had been thrown in as an afterthought and had been sitting out. Something like this happens every time I visit this location, which is why I rarely get Burger King. Between the unprofessional attitude and the fact that my food was cold, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I will say that I overall DETEST burger kings as I feel their burgers are filth and the rest of their food is too.  Then came the deep fried cheese ball.  I saw an image for Cheesy Tots and though that sounded amazing after a day of near starvation. I pull up, and a LOVELY guy named Jim came to the window.  We schmoozed and he told me about the Cheesy Tots and that they're made to order and never frozen (nice) and because they were made to order, \"IF I WANT TO EAT THEM IN THE CAR, I SHOULD WAIT A BIT FOR THEM TO COOL SO I DON'T BURN MYSELF\".... THANK YOU!!!!! I was so prepared to drive off and pop one in my mouth only to feel the volcano of heat within my mouth which could have caused me to do something REALLY stupid on the road.  Because he truly wanted to make sure that I did not hurt myself, or others, he took two seconds to tell me that and I greatly appreciate it.  If he's a window guy, he should be a manager... If he's already a manager, he should be a regional manager... and so on.  Jim, singlehandedly took someone who hadn't eaten Burger King in 10+ years to someone who is willing to try it out more so now.  Thanks a ton Jim! You earned it."}
{"text":"I haven't visited Burger King in years. I ordered the Chicken Parm sandwich Combo. Fries were gross, I didn't eat more than 5 of them. Maybe the temp changed the taste? The sandwich was dry...like the desert. A lot of cheese but needed a lot more sauce. Chicken was ok."}
{"text":"Hiiiigh priced disgusting food served up with terrible service al dente.  9.50$ for a burger? This isn't an Angus burger I'm paying for. 5.20$ for chicken fries isn't as offensive to my wallet. But 15$ plus for the combination seems obscene. You want fries and a drink with that? Add another 4$+ per order and that's probably for the smallest options. Don't even get me started on their bottled waters.  What really grinds my gears was the service. The cashier was fine, she got the job done and quite efficiently. She also was dealing with some customers who were asking her the prices on every item on the menu and did it without losing her mind which I commend. My issue and the reason I am giving 1 star is because of the other 2 out of 3 in the back.   Service is the biggest thing for me. I will tip extremely well if the service has earned it. This isn't one of those types of establishments but that's just an example. Anyways the hefty young kid decides to overlook my place in the chain and help two people behind me beforehand. I watched as the lady (the 3rd person) made the exact same sandwiches one after the other (3 in a row) and he (the hefty one) packaged each and gave it to people after me.  This seemed to be the theme for me today, terrible service.   So I see chicken fries I ordered sitting there, ready to go and just waiting to be paired with my burger. He continues to ignore it and give the matching burgers to numbers 87 and then 86 and then I asked (you have 85?) And without turning his generously proportioned body around, said yeah just a minute and continued to chitchat with his smaller counterpart. Ugh.   Without turning around he reaches his arm back and plops my order on the counter. Ugh. That coupled with the high prices, would have resulted in -3 stars but I can't go lower than 1."}
{"text":"SUPER SLOW!!!! I will be the only customer and it still takes at least 10 mins to get my food, and half the time it's stale and lukewarm. Also, I asked for a BK crown for my daughter, and when the lady handed it to me, the manager came over to her and said right in front of me and my kid, \"You do realize you just wasted 15 cents right? Don't just give those away to people anymore, make them order a kid's meal to get it.\" SERIOUSLY!!! Yeah, I don't go to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Burger King is fortunate that their food is so good because it's their only redeeming quality. This particular location is always SO SLOW on their drive thru times. We had 4 orders and had to repeat (and correct) each of them at least once. When we finally got to the second window (because, of course, the first one was not open), they staggered our order to us and the combos weren't even in the same bags. The drinks were mixed up and luckily, we checked before we pulled off and realized we were short an order of French fries. No napkins or straws were given to us, either. Will not go back. Oh, and got hit up by two homeless people for cigarettes. Bah!! But when we asked for salt, they did kindly give us about 20 packets."}
{"text":"This crew definitely needed more training before opening. There was 2 customers ahead of me and I waited 30 mins for a kids meal and a cheese burger.  I went up to ask about my food twice, only to find out my food had been sitting there the whole time. I got an \"oops\" and \"here you go\"   Also I am not exaggerating when I say that every table was dirty.  This crew looks lost in there."}
{"text":"I walked in and walked up to order food and the worker immediately said, \"You can order food here but you have to take it to go. We're about to lock the doors.\" I hadn't been looking at the time, but apparently it was five till 10 PM. I said, \"I can't eat here?\" Male worker looked at female manager and she said, \"No, you'd have to take it to go.\""}
{"text":"This Burger King was great. I ordered a Whopper meal with hash browns around 9:00 am two mornings in a row. It was delicious and the employees were great. The place looked good too. Clean. On the other hand, the men's restroom could be a bit cleaner. Looked like there was a broken urinal that didn't flush. Floor looked fairly clean but was sticky probably from a weird floor cleaner/mop mix. So bathroom could use a bit more attention. But again, main area and kitchen areas looked good. Also, when I first walked in there was a crown on every table. Looks good."}
{"text":"Worst Burger King I've visited. The employee at the counter acted as if I was an inconvenience to her day when I walked in to place my order. The food came up just to discover the chicken sandwich I had ordered was made with old and burnt chicken. When I took the order back to the counter and asked to have it made fresh, you would have thought I had asked for something horribly crazy. The order was remade fresh, but the chicken was still burnt...obviously the oil in their fryer is extremely old and needs to be changed out with new oil. Oh and let's not forget the girl working the counter was wearing yoga pants. Where has personal pride gone? I can't believe this restaurant. It's no wonder everytime I stop in I'm the only customer around. I don't even like fast food, but it's close to the motel where I stay for work when I'm here. I guess I'll be putting a little more effort in going out to eat, because I will never be back here."}
{"text":"Picked up a whopper tonight and I even had a coupon for \"buy one, get one\". The girl in the drive threw was very nice and took my coupon with no problem, she told me to pull up because the \"whopper meat wasn't ready\". I didn't fully understand what that meant but figured it was freshly being grilled, I was sadly mistaken. I waited roughly 4-5 mins in a parking spot which I didn't mind at all if that meant my food would be super fresh. When I got home, (I live across the street literally) all of the food was cold. I even heated it up in my microwave for 30 secs and that only made it luke warm. With that said I won't be back to BK any time soon."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came here today around 11 or so in the drive thru. I ordered my meal and she informed the guy taking our order (his name was Anthony) that she was going to make a separate order since we wanted to pay separately. Apparently it was a problem because there was someone behind us and he would not let us make that second order. I have NEVER had that kind of problem at any other drive thru, and he apologized over the intercom and my friend even told him \"i have worked at Burger King before and I was always able to do separate orders.\" We think he was too worried about his timing or whatever but either way it was bullshit how we had to go back around just to order her food. He didn't even bother acknowledging the fact that we had to come back around and didn't even say sorry again he just acted like we were a completely different customer not even 3 minutes later! What a joke."}
{"text":"Don't eat here!!!!! They have horrible service, the food is nasty, and they take forever to make one hamburger."}
{"text":"THE WORST.  Cold food....giant white hard chunk in my chicken sandwich and no idea what it was...nearly broke my tooth!!  The buns are always dry as a bone.  Never again will I make the mistake of eating here."}
{"text":"Okay so I came here last night, well actually this morning at 1:15 am. I was so dissatisfied with this Burger King!  first Of all, all I wanted was a whopper and a coke. They had no coke. Wait what?! Then when I asked for a coke icee they still wanted to charge me $1.25 for the upgrade. Another person in my party wanted a Cinnabon and nope, none of those either. Also they screwed up our order and charged us for two burgers instead of one. Then when i brought it up the guy at the window was so rude. As if he didn't make the mistake. Long story short, worst 1am food trip.."}
{"text":"Well you walk in and you are not even greeted. Time to place order and Elvira with all the piercings turns around. She is not friendly at all.. and she is very unhappy at her job. A corpse has more emotions then she showed.   We got our order and fries were about 2 hours old. Went to get our soda and it was out of about 85% of the selections.   Terrible place to eat  Stay away not recommended at all."}
{"text":"Stopped here to get to breakfast sandwiches just a little past 10:30 and you can't even get anything who the hell eats lunch at 10:30 ridiculous will ever come back to Burger King"}
{"text":"I asked if it had tomatoes. I said I was allergic to tomatoes. They said there are no tomatoes on that sandwich. Do I want tomatoes? I said no, please, no tomatoes. I get the sandwich, there are two tomatoes on there. So they put tomatoes on a sandwich that doesn't get tomatoes after we talked about how I can't have tomatoes.   I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 whopper meals and 1 chicken sandwich meal. They asked us to park in front. Got our food 20 minutes later. There was only 2 sandwiches in the bag. Went back inside, they gave us the sandwiches they forgot to pack. Went home. Got 4 whoppers, no chicken sandwich. Eff this place. It wasn't even busy AT ALL. Never coming to this location again."}
{"text":"This place needs new  management and new employees, we used to love burger king until we got food that was so cold you could have sworn they just got it out of a refrigerator. Now we are disgusted with burger king. Its a shame!"}
{"text":"This Burger King has the best BK food in the Cleveland area.  The burgers are always  hot and taste like they were just made.  The help is polite and efficient.   I always stop here when I shop at Sam's."}
{"text":"Food here is meh. Got the 5 for &4 deal... It's nothing special. You get a bacon cheeseburger, 4 nuggets, fries, a drink, and a cookie. The cookie is the 5th item Wendy's doesn't offer (they have 4 for $4). Wendy's definitely beats them in quality and flavor. My bacon cheeseburger was sloppy and dry tasting. Fries were good. Nuggets tasted like the big cheap bag you can get at Walmart and had soggy spots."}
{"text":"The best restaurant ever it has the best food ever also great service ever  I would recommend this for everyone  everywhere even worldwide"}
{"text":"This location is sketchy, it attracts the light rail traffic. Actually have a couple of complaints for different occasions. Once for breakfast, we drove up to the drive thru at 6:45 A.M. the manager came out the back door and shouted they were still closed. She then went on to shout 'my fault, I overslept' this was 45 mins after opening time. Lol. Also this place always forgets items from your order. So make sure you check your bag before zooming off. Overall the workers work hard and keeping it ghetto fabulous at this location!"}
{"text":"If you've ever said to yourself \"Hey I want to eat lunch in a dirty bus station in the south this place is for you!\"  Consistently the dirtiest restaurant in the city and I my visits are years apart.  The food is typical burger king fare but definately get a to go bag."}
{"text":"Since they have been rebuilding some of the Burger Kings I finally decide to go to one and see what is going on. I was impressed. Clean and that's including the staff. While I was waiting on my breakfast for my wife and i I noticed they had a little game kiosk which I must say was fun while i was waiting. I like how they had different variations of booths, some high and some average height. The food was fresh and hot and the assistant manager Fernando was on point in getting the order right the first time with a smile. I must say the big screen TV was an added on plus if i decided to eat there."}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest, most undesirable Burger King I have ever visited. The customer service level is the lowest level possible."}
{"text":"This is the worst Burger King I been to! They served old overcooked French fries and the fish burger was old, lettuce old!! Yuk!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a \"new chicken sandwich\" and a double cheeseburger.  The burger came out refrigerator-cold with two pieces of unmelted cheese sitting on top of dead, cold, and grey patties.  The chicken sandwich was greasy to the touch, so dark brown as to appear blackish, as it was so logged with grease.  The mayo underneath the chicken was curdled.  Obviously precooked, pre-assembled, and either microwaved or held under a heat lamp.    I take some blame for taking a chance on this 3rd rate fast food chain.  I had to walk back in and get a refund.  Fellow burger lovers, you've been warned!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the rudest employees. My order was all messed up. I will be taking my money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Asked for bacon and no pickles.... there pickles and no bacon..... I keep giving this place a chance, but they keep failing me.........don't come here they suck. If it's not getting attitude from their cashiers, it's getting the wrong order.  Do yourself a favor and just drive a little further and go to a different one."}
{"text":"THIS IS FOR THE BK ON THE CORNER OF BUCKEYE & AVONDALE IN THE FRY'S PARKING LOT--IT'S NOT LISTED ON YELP AND I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT ADDRESS TO ADD IT ON.  My husband and I hadn't eaten at a Burger King in the longest time, when we saw an ad for sweet potato fries.  We decided to try it, so he ran out to pick up drive-thru.  We both got the same thing, Whoppers and the sweet potato fries with Sprites.    First thing, \"have it your way\" seems to have run downhill.  We ordered the Whoppers with no pickles (neither of us like them), and it was listed on the container, but they had an abundance of pickles on them.  I counted 7 on mine...yech!  Plus, they're added right on the patty, so the ketchup was all over them.  When I took them off, the ketchup came with them...had to add my own.  Other than that, it was a decent Whopper, just like I remembered.  Second thing, with sweet potato fries, the point is to enjoy the sweetness of the potato (at least, that's how I feel).  These fries were so overly salted, they tasted like regular fries, which I didn't want.  I was honestly trying to wipe them off, so I could taste them.  The ones I did have were pretty good.  The rest, which ended up in the bottom of the bag, were drenched in salt.  I'm sorry to say, I was a bit disappointed in our trip down memory lane at Burger King.  Not sure if we'll give them another shot, or not.  But, if we do, we're gonna make sure to ask for no salt on the fries, I wonder if they can fulfill that order."}
{"text":"Had the New crispy sandwich supposed to be bigger and juicier it was thin and almost well done  also it had little tiny like three pieces of lettuce that were chopped up into little squares on it that was it! It was horrible nothing like advertised very disappointed !!!! :("}
{"text":"Was here on July 17, 2016 at around 1pm and absolutely worst BK experience ever. Place was dirty, took literally 25 minutes to get our food and still got our order wrong. Stated they were waiting on chicken nuggets but nuggets were not hot when we received. Husband had to go back in because they forgot fries, no apology from manager.  Overheard another customer state they had just watched a cockroach crawl across the counter."}
{"text":"Quick - friendly - accurate - priced right - clean place - better then your typical BK and it gets not only a quick review, but a quick 3 stars! Not a fan of asking me to donate!"}
{"text":"One of the worse locations I've ever been to and will make a note not to return - bad service and my food wasn't even cooked!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Ordered a double whopper which was inedible. I took about 4 bites cause I felt bad wasting it. But then I just had to throw it away cause I couldn't take it anymore. Don't bother visiting this location. Disgusting waste of money. Sad, cause I used to love the whopper."}
{"text":"I just have to say the drive thru is amazing. There's a very nice lady call Mary she was very helpful"}
{"text":"Had to argue with the cashier while ordering a kids meal. The menu clearly shows that with the kids meal you can choose apples slices instead of a toy. Instead of looking at the menu she asked another employee, who confirms what the menu shows. Instead of apologizing and making sure the change was made, she gave me a blank look and i had to make the request again. Too much to expect at a fast food joint."}
{"text":"It's very pitiful that I have to give a 1 star to any restaurant or business. But this place deserves it.  Burger King hasn't really been good for anything, really. The fries stink and are usually cold, and the burgers have spots with color. I really have no idea what it is.  The few times that I've been to this location, we've only gone through drive-thru. The dining room always looks closed. There was one instance when I pulled up to the speaker, and no one answered for about 2 minutes. I drove around to the window, and the lady didn't really apologize and just took my order.   I really didn't know what I was supposed to expect. The food always sucks, and so does the customer service. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"So slow it's ridiculous. Plus they got our order wrong. They fixed it, but it took 15 minutes for two shakes!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Burger King I have ever been to. The burger was thrown together very sloppy. Food was cold. Eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"So normally I wouldn't review a fast food chain, but this Burger King, is by far the worst of all chain restaurants in all of Las Vegas.  The drive through people are downright awful.  In the last four trips I have been here, three times was just to order iced coffee and milkshakes and have been turned away every time to either machines being off or coffee isn't ready yet, or they are cleaning and don't want to turn the machines back on.  On top of that, the drive through people don't even care or apologize.  The last time I ordered food here they shorted my order chicken nuggets.  I don't know what kind of business they are running but they obviously don't like making money and will hire anybody who has a pulse.  Upper level management or the ownership needs to step in and get this place in order.  I would give them 0 stars if I could but that is not an option.  Awful, downright awful."}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience with Catalina the supervisor  she needs to learn customer service and how to speak to people . when you go thru the drive thru make sure its not her so you dont lose your cool like i did . and i reported her. I hope she gets more training on how to be a boss ."}
{"text":"This place looks torn down! The menu cards were sticked to the island and you have to order them. The menu on the LCD screens wasn't there. Not sure why they turned them off.  I ordered 6 piece chicken nuggets, a glass for a soft drink and a chicken tender sandwich. It costed me 17 freaking dollars. They were guzzling money at this place. I would get that whole order under $10 in United States, considering the conversion rate, the cost should able atleast below $15.   Anyways, I enjoyed my ice tea and the chicken nuggets. Not sure why I didn't like the chicken sandwich. It tasted weird.   The person who was taking order was French and doesn't understand English. So, you have to show him the number on the paper to place the order. It was funny though!"}
{"text":"There are actually two different BKs at LAS, but this one is sure to have the same apathetic employees and the most overpriced fast food I have EVER purchased as the other location.  Realizing that BK can hit you up one last time, everything here is DOUBLE the normal retail price as back home--wherever your home is.  $9.89 for a regular Chicken combo?  $3.50 for an extra order of fries?  OK, so my butt didn't need the extra order of fries, but you guys!!!  I thought the whole point of eating at airport fast food places was so that we could avoid those strangely-named snack shops that used to be in airports 20 years ago.  Like, \"Karen's House of Nuts and Pies\" or \"Ye Olde Sausage Hut.\"  Anyone remember what it was like in those days before McDonald's was able to push its way in?  Well, thank you BK for showing me that $14.79 is never too much for an abysmal chicken sandwich, medium drink, and two medium fries."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here,  I decided to hop the bandwagon and tried the mac n' cheetos. I thought it was good. It was definitely shaped with a cheeto puff. The outside was crispy and the inside was filled with gooey mac n cheese. The portion (5 pieces) was perfect because the food can get taste greasy fast. I would recommend it with ketchup (I know weird, but really really good!). Also, I ordered the cheeseburger kids meal which came with a cheeseburger, small fries, apple juice caprisun, and a toy. I'm a little old for a kids meal, but the portion is great. When I went, the toys were characters from The Penguins of Madagascar! I'd rather get this meal with a variety of foods than a giant burger. Plus it was only $3.79! I was a little upset when I saw the portion of the meat in the burger. It was itty bitty and more like I was eating bread. But it wasn't bad. This meal was my childhood and it was great to reminisce the pit stops to my local Burger King. I would pick Burger King over McDonald any day (except the soft serve ice cream lol)!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 10 piece nugget and a sprite. Pulled up to the drive-through window and gave them my card. Gave me my card back Then they told me to pull around and wait in the parking lot. Took about 6 minutes before I gave up and left. I PAID and didn't get my food.  Starting to understand why they have 1.5 stars on yelp"}
{"text":"I would literally score this place NO STARS! First, the look is horrible and outdated. Second, the customer service is bad they make it hard for you to order what you want or they make a mistake OR they mix your order with another. HOW ANNOYING! Lastly,  they don't take care of their customer. They do not ask if i want condiments, gave me no straw and no napkins. I do love burger king but this one is terrible!! BEWARE!!"}
{"text":"This BK is a total joke. Just left and don't know if I should laugh or be irritated. The staff was rude and slow. And look at this burger I just got- no pickles mustard or ketchup. But I guess I can't blame them. They work at Burger King. Actually I can.... get a job you like so you don't impact my day. However, my experience here was laughable given I was one of two customers and my burger was pretty much plain. I also asked for a spicy chicken sandwich no meal. She says, what #? I said, spicy chicken sandwich no meal. She asks AGAIN what #. Did this a 3rd time................ So I pick a number and she asks me if I want the meal. Are you kidding me??!?!?btw, Just opened my second burger and it's got pickles this time still no ketchup or mustard. So one had pickles one didn't. Consistency is clearly a priority here........So why it took homie 10 min to make who knows. Total joke. Are you all saving on condiments?"}
{"text":"The bacon on my sandwich looked undercooked. I told the girl at the window but she said it was fine!!  I think this Burger King needs to hire some better employees. Haven't had any issues with any other Burger King."}
{"text":"I have given this location a try numerous times. It has been open for awhile now, so there really is no excuse for their business to be as inadequate as it is. There is never anybody in the drive thru, but every single time I've gone they have pulled me out of the line to park and wait for my order. This would be fine, although I don't understand why it always always happens, if my order had ever been correct. There is always something missing, and the items are never assembled or cooked properly. Today was my last try. I made a $37 lunch order, so it was understandable that I was pulled forward to wait. However, I waited there for them to bring out soggy fries, nearly uncooked chicken nuggets, and cold, hard chicken sandwiches made with an exponential amount of mayo on both pieces of bread when I asked for no mayo. I also specifically asked for a \"lot of ketchup\" in the bag, but received none, and no nugget sauce. I also did not receive any of the desserts I ordered. In conclusion, I spent $40 on fast food today and not a single bite of it was edible. I don't really understand how that works but thanks for the Sprite guys, it was nice and cold. They do not have an Icee machine as advertised, and are often out of things."}
{"text":"I'd  give them 0 stars if I can! No service and they saw me standing there and oh no one else was there and only one car in line.  They had about 5 employees working. The lady continued to talk and laugh with her manager while I stood there waiting and she saw me.  I ended up leaving after 5 min.  SMH all I wanted was breakfast before work."}
{"text":"Don't go here, I pay for a double whopper and got single one, I call back and they hangout on me!!!!"}
{"text":"MMMM i love BK! I thought that having this place in the airport was amazing! The prices seem a bit higher though which I really hate but the taste and stuffing was delish!! great time to eat while waiting to board."}
{"text":"Worst location ever. They fill our drinks halfway, food is either cold, burnt, or has hair in it. The customer service is deplorable. I hope they get shut down, or get new management. I usually brush it off and don't bother getting my money back.. not today. Today was the last straw with this crappy location."}
{"text":"Frequent order errors and often not the best service in the drive-through but for the most part it's exactly what you need for fast food which is something quick and easy when you're in a hurry and need some below average/average food. I do love their french fries & the hashbrowns that they have in the morning which are like mini tater tot discs. They also have Cinnabon cinnamon rolls. Also, about 2-years ago my kids and I got very sick and with food poisoning from there. But no issues since. Thankfully."}
{"text":"Drive thru open 24hrs. This location does their whoppers great. For a fast food burger, the onion topping is a nice touch and you can really taste the flame grill. If you just want a bite, get the whopper jr for $1.79! Wednesday whopper special is $2.99 for a regular sized whopper! Ask for angry sauce - it is sweet, sour and mildly spicy.. yummmyyy! I wouldn't recommend the fish burger (2 for $5 special)... it isn't as good as Mcdonald's imo. Friendly service, food quickly ready."}
{"text":"Dear Burger King,  Please fire the black drive thru woman.   Thank you, The yelp community"}
{"text":"Cheeseburgers, easy to eat and carry on a plane."}
{"text":"This is the dirtiest store I have ever been at, the sofa machine is gross and caked with syrup, full trash at the condiment stand, rude employees with no emotion or customer service skills. The cashier has to swipe my card 27 times and scratched the stop on my brand new card.... I will never eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"Nuggets weren't great and the fries weren't either. Wait time was longer than usual. The 2 cheeseburger deal is a little more than before at $3.49, still a good value. 10 piece  $1.49 as usual."}
{"text":"Slowest Burger King in the history of Burger King restaurants.  Seriously took 20 mins to get our food."}
{"text":"This is the closest Burger King to our house so we go there quite a bit.  It isn't always the neatest restaurant but they always get our order right & the drive thru moves really fast."}
{"text":"I waited over a year before trying this place again but it made no difference.  I just left this location, ordering two Whoppers with a coupon. What dis I get? Ice cold patties (yes, both of them) slapped halfway on a bun, with ketsup and mayo on half the bun area leaving plain bread without condiments on half the sandwich. What? Were the heat lamps broke? Can the staff not manage a dull \"bun swipe\" with the mayo spatula? I may have used a coupon but it was still MY money that you got. This is ridiculously lazy and so sub-standard to be disgraceful. It's apparent the franchise owner has zero respect for. Customers and that attirude trickled down."}
{"text":"If you have driven by this burger king and never noticed it, you are not alone. It is located in a super congested area with many stores right next to thrift shop. And they have a special right now that was only supposed to last for 1 weekend are you buy 1 whopper and get 1 free. Jema took my order and she was extremely sweet and pleasant. It was very nice of her to take the time to understand the order because the last time I went to Burger King what is a very unpleasant experience. Mind you, I haven't been to burger king in at least 6 years or more, so this is a very important trip.   Yeah, but my order still wasn't exactly right. So much for the \" have it your way\"  mantra. I suppose it has changed to \"you'll eat at I give you\""}
{"text":"When Spirit airlines is delayed for days, burger king is a savior. I got a whopper at 10:30 PM, and they loaded my bag with all sorts of sauces.  this kept me moderately happy for our 3 hour delay until 2AM.  a little pricey for a BK, but its the airport. you are trapped with airport prices"}
{"text":"Don't normally come to chain places, but had the craving. What can I say it's Burger King pretty consistent. But this place is clean and service is awesome. Friendly people always smiling. The Whopper is pretty good too"}
{"text":"I ordered TWO burgers. How do you fuck that up?!?!! They gave me completely wrong burgers. Wow"}
{"text":"Usually have great service here. Today service was good, but food  was crap. I got a whopper Junior meal, and the way home, as usual I  ate a few fries (which were fresh and good). I arrive at home to consume my overpriced whopper Jr and the top of the bun is so hard I can't even bite through it. The kicker is the tomatoes are green and I have an end. Needless to say that got thrown in the trash, and I made me a sandwich. Seven dollars down the drain."}
{"text":"Walking into this Burger King location, I noticed how clean and inviting it was on the outside! As I walked into the restaurant, it was the CLEANEST Bk that I'd ever been to. The staff is amazing and friendly as can be!! I ordered two whopper meals and a chocolate Oreo shake for my brother and me. The women working behind the counter were very welcoming, fast, and efficient!!!! I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"I've been here in before a few times.  Whenever i get a craving for the whopper, it usually hits the spot!!.  This place is renovated, i'm not sure how long ago, but, its sort of a McD's theme, with a sitting area in the corner with the tv above the area.  I do miss the corner bench that they had, but i bet it was a pita to keep clean when food falls in the cracks.  Anyhow, i decided to try the spicy BK fish, the girl at cash suggested the 2 for $5 Mix and Match.  Good deal !!  And she advised me that the spicy vs the non spicy is they just add jalapeno on top to make it spicy.  Spicy BK fish was a bit small looking in the packaging.  Its comparable to like a small single burger from Harveys. They put like 5 jalapenos ontop, i took 3 off. It wasnt really tasty.  Poutine was ok..  Next time,  i'm going to stick to my whopper!! And maybe take - out.  Service is good. Parking is ok, There are like 7 spots near the drive thru, and another area east that have a lot more parking. Bathroom was a bit messy, and one of the trash was overflowing.  This was at 7pm on a Monday.  3-4 stars for service!! 2 stars for the messy bathroom, and overflowing trash, and the spicy BK fish  I think this location is near a school so they get a lot of foot traffic from students, but no excuse for the mess.  Maybe next time, it will be a better experience."}
{"text":"This place made my day today !!!  This is by far THE BEST BURGER EVER !! I ordered the \"Halloween\" burger and it's delicious !!! I want to thank Susan who helped me with my order. This place is fast, friendly and very clean !  THIS PLACE ROCKS"}
{"text":"I love burger king and I went there today super excited because I was craving a chicken sandwich. I ordered two and get all the way back to my work when there was only one in the bag. Super upset because I can't drive back now."}
{"text":"Great experience !! Quick breakfast stop, met with smiles and great attitudes !! Dawn running around, with busy drive up and Antoinette was super fast in making my non breakfast items. Wish I could count on this at other establishments....Happy Camper, now I have to go to work"}
{"text":"Always liked this BK They do their job efficiently and courteously that's what matters. Trying to analyze a fast food chain is senseless. Bottom line, it's clean, the foods hot including fries when you get them. the staff courteous. Try and get that from Mc.D's!!!"}
{"text":"This location doesn't even deserve one star. I've given them plenty of chances but each time fails. Something is always wrong with anything I order. Today I paid 26$ for garbage and when I called the manager Dennis I believe was just a joke. They are way over priced, the customer service makes me sick. So now I have to go back out in 100+ degree weather with a toddler to get my money back because now they aren't answering the phone. Please everyone don't waste you time on this location. They are a serious waste of money."}
{"text":"Just got out of this place after a 25 minute wait for two whoppers and a large fry...by far the worst BK I've been too...!!!"}
{"text":"Service was slow employees were on their cell phones on personal calls manager asked him to get off their cell phones she laughed they laughed they continued on cell phones the restaurant or Burger King sitting area was dirty the floor out front was dirty and it took over 15 minutes to get a burger and fries"}
{"text":"This place always shorts you when you get carry out. Lots of attitude from most of the workers. They also get your sandwiches wrong. You should open the sandwiches right there to be sure you got what you paid for. Me, I'll try one of the other BKs in town, but this one is best avoided."}
{"text":"This is the worst Burger King location I've ever visited. After countless times of really bad service, I've been forced to make the first ever complaint. I just came back from a visit and the burger I ordered is dry as hell. The bread looks like it's been sitting out on the counter for days. The Coke Zero taste horrible.  Never ever ordering from this horrible location."}
{"text":"Lets say, I do not eat very much fast food but needed a quick bite and went to this Burger King.  Well I was sitting at the drive through for at least 2 minutes and heard no \"can I help you? or one moment please\".  When I was about to drive off, she took my order, after I placed a simple order \"medium french fries\" she said pull around.  I pulled around and nobody was at the window, then the lady came and starred at me asking why I was there.  I said I just ordered a medium french fries, she said... OH you did order that, I said forget it and drove off.  I was so disgusted I called the manager that same day March 19, 2013 at 7:54 PM and told her everything.   This place has to get it together no wonder why there is hardly anyone at this restaurant whenever I drive by."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken took awhile, it was cold on the inside!  Ordered meal but fries was missing.  I got to call!  Went through drive thru so I left and never check."}
{"text":"This Burger King sucks.ordered chicken fries. I waited for about 25 minutes only to discover the lady that took my order told the girl that she had already filled the order. They were cold and the fries were cold. Only passing through but won't come back to this one!"}
{"text":"Usually always good friendly attentive employees. James new to the front was friendly and it didn't take him long to ring up our big order. Timeliness with our order is always appreciated. Thanks"}
{"text":"First thing that I noticed walking in was the funky smell they had in the location. This is the only fast food I eat (at least try) because the standarts are usually higher.... Then the credit machine didn't print out my slip and the overall look and feel was pretty bad. A customer near me just complained on the taste..... Good thing I have a strong stomach,  so I'm ready for  an adventure. ... Won't be back 2 this location again....  Improvement is a must!"}
{"text":"manager is a a condescending loser.  had a $30 dollar order they completely botched. unfortunately this seems common place these days.  called to complain that he ruined my kids diner and the guy actually questioned me saying he made the burgers himself !  you had one job! you blew it, then you made it worse by suggested i am looking for a free hamburger and me calling a fast food place to complain is something i enjoy. booo burger king ! staff should be fired."}
{"text":"This particular Burger King does not allow service dogs to enter their fast food restaurant!! Service dogs are allowed everywhere!! The manager seemed not to care either way! So beware of this buyer king!! Apparently the manager does not follow the guidelines of the law!!!!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a negative star I could give this place. I'm so annoyed that Burger King allows management to treat their customers this way!! Unethical, rude and unprofessional in every aspect of each word.  Absolute worst place. I was behind a car in the drive thru and as the car pulled forward to the window and myself to the speaker, all the lights were shut off and a Spanish speaking lady said whhhhhhhhaaaaat??! What you say? Anyhow, I proceed to move forward and wait for the person in front of me to get his order. The \"manager\" sees that I'm behind the car. The car leaves and I pull up to the window which she has securely locked. I beep my horn, knock on the window and say hello? Miss? I even recorded her blatantly ignoring me. She looked like she was on something and feeling out. I will NEVER step foot in this establishment that employs trash to serve their customers. What's worst is that this was the second issue with two different Burger Kings in less than 3 hours and a mile apart. First BK didn't speak much English and charged me incorrectly."}
{"text":"Being the fast food fan that I am I am glad to see that Burger King opened a new Las Vegas restaurant. For awhile it looked like Burger King was making a slow disappearance from Las Vegas.    I am also a cola fan. The star of the newest Las Vegas Burger King is the computerized Coke machine. Normally I am impressed if a restaurant has strawberry soda. There are 105 flavors. What is also impressive is the amount of diet colas.    The restaurant itself is on the small side. The interior is modern. And it is clean.    The employees were friendly.     Despite its location on Las Vegas Boulevard, a couple of miles south of the Strip proper, it is difficult to find. It is just south of the outlet center, between Windmill and Warm Springs on the east side of the road.    My chances of returning are high. There are 95 flavors of soda that I would like to try."}
{"text":"This is currently the Burger King serving  Boulder City. It is convenient to anybody passing through or spending time in Boulder City. It sits at the intersection of US 93 and Nevada Way where the big horn sheep statues welcome you to Boulder City. It is nearly impossible to miss.    I have patronized the Boulder City Burger King when I wanted to eat something light and quench my thirst after hiking in the vicinity. Usually onion rings and cola.    In my case the Boulder City Burger King is a convenience because it is a coin toss away from my home away from home: a Starbuck's. This is the wild card that brings me in for a snack."}
{"text":"I love biting into a whopper with cheese, rodeo fries, or a Bk muffin. However, I do not like biting into human hair. When I ask for a breakfast sandwich, I want it with ham, egg, and cheese and no human hair. Today, when I was eating the BK breakfast sandwich and hash brown fries, I unintentionally bit into two pieces of human hair. That is disgusting and a red flag for quality control.     I am leaving this Burger King at 2 stars because my other 27 visits since joining Yelp in 2011 have been okay. Plus they have Seattle's Best.    Human hair in my food is a poor example of having it your way. I bestow this location with a minimum 6 month suspension. Today is April 6, 2015 making October 6th, the next time I can return if I do. In the meantime, this Burger King seriously needs to invest in hair nets."}
{"text":"Why review Burger King? The answer is that just as the Burger King commercial says, \"Have it your way,\" I say \"Yelp it your way.\" And I also say that money talks and where I spend my money, I talk about it on Yelp.\" Yelping it my way, I will talk about this very Burger King where I spent my money.       In recent times, Burger King has disappointed me. There was the late night visit at the Kingman location we immediately exited because it reminded  me of a scene out of Beavis & Butthead. There was a visit at the Serene Avenue location where a teen employee gave me a stinkeye and the whopper included pieces of human hair. And a visit to the Boulder City location where the employee went on break instead of completing my order. I could go on. It is understandable that I would return to Burger King with a cupoun and convenience. Let's face it, from my perception Burger King is free falling into the Kmart of fast food restaurants.       This Burger King in the shadow of Sunset Station is conveniently located between the parkland east of Boulder Highway and my residence. Last week following adventures out in the desert, I used a cupoun for $3 for 10 piece chicken nuggets and Large fries. I'd pay for the medium Coke. Today, I stopped here for breakfast on the way to The Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve.       This Burger King is up with the times. A recent remodel gave customers the Coke Freestyle machine, WiFi, outlets, and comfortable seating.      The staff here is allright. They are fast and you could say friendly. I'd even see the manager interacting with an elderly woman who was telling him that his employee should be promoted. The elderly woman and I give our votes that the customer service is allright. That includes the cleanliness of the restaurant.      Likewise the food is good but not Great. The 10 piece chicken nuggets with two units of honey mustard sauce was okay. The fries were okay. This morning the sausage, egg, & cheese biscuit was okay. The surprise is that their coffee is really good and strong. Then again it should not be a surprise because it is the Seattle's Best brew that I am familiar with from my Border's Books days. This cup of Joe really added some pep to my energy level.       When all is said and done, this Burger King is allright. This allright Burger King could be a role model for some of the locations that left me disappointed."}
{"text":"bring back the red velvet oreo shake!!!!!! :( can't find it anywhere else and it was seriously amazing!"}
{"text":"Great service! I ordered one of those new grilled hotdogs and I guess they messed the order up. One of the managers actually hunted me down in the airport to give me the right order...I wish they had burger kings like this around where I live!"}
{"text":"Walked in and stood at the counter for 6 minutes. No one ever came up, 2 people walked by the register.  No one said one word to me, so I walked out. Its 9:20. There was 2 cars total in the drive through and no one eating inside. No excuse for piss poor service. . I walked right next door and ate at Mcalisters."}
{"text":"Okay I'm headed there right now. let's see, I will give my full experience. Based upon these other reviews I'm not expecting much. I will be utilizing the drive thru for the duration of this visit and experimentation.  I will be ordering two whoppers and a Medium onion ring, not too much to ask right?  I have arrived to this destination, the current state of the drive thru is 0 other vehicles in front or in back of me. Here it goes.  Time of arrival is June 28th, 2015 6:55 p.m. The person on the microphone sounds upbeat and positive. Quick & responsive. Said \"Thank You Sir\" as I handed her payment via debit card. Then said: \"We'll have  it right out.\" While  returning my method of payment.  Asked if I wanted Ketchup, to which I  thought into deeply and replied \"Ranch please.\" Food was quickly administered as stated.   She said: \"Thank you, have a nice day.\" While handing me my bag. Time out of drive thru was 6:58 p.m. Order is accurate and looks promising.    Full experience: 10/10.  Complaints: None Would I return to this location again?: Most definitely.   In conclusion, I was very impressed by the speed, and courtesy shown by the drive thru attendant. Generally in any fast food drive-thru setting its either one or the other, hit or miss. In this case however I received both. Very rare these days, very rare. Thank you Burger King  at E. Mckellips, for being quite pleasant and positively  memorable. Two thumbs up. 5 star rating.   [Reader: Please add me as a friend!]"}
{"text":"Nine f'ing dollars for chicken nuggets, and cold ones at that.  That's a 600% markup over retail, for a dirty shared environment where none of the four 'restaurants' want to take responsibility for cleaning.  I'd say go elsewhere but hey, it's their airport, so that's why it is what it is and you can do nothing about it.  Can someone tell me how HMS Host operates every concession at every airport in every state?!?!"}
{"text":"You guys forget my fries! I always order an extra value fry and twice now it hasn't been put in my bag. I always get charged for it. Some of the staff needs to be better trained. I've been enjoying the coupons I've been getting but frustrated that the order isn't right."}
{"text":"My bf and I decided to get a BK breakfast this morning (only because I got an email that made it look so deceivingly good). I haven't had a BK breakfast in years because the last time I did it was a big let down- but I figured what the hell.  We went through the drive thru to save time and ordered a croissant sandwich meal, an order of cinnabons, French toast sticks and a burrito. We paid and drove home only to find that the French toast sticks and hash brown (from the meal) were nowhere to be found. My coffee was also cold which was a complete shame. It's not as though they were busy either- we were the only ones in the drive thru and no one was inside. That should have been a red flag but nooo, I didn't listen to my gut.   We called to let them know all that was missing and the manager was nice enough to say that when we DO come back that we would get all these items replaced. I don't know if I'll ever go back in to get all these because the food I did get was subpar. I think this is the end of my BK days."}
{"text":"Great service & food with the best part being the place was nearly spotless!"}
{"text":"Horrible service through drive thru. I pull up to the speaker and the lady yells \"what\". I replied with \"what\" and yelled \"what do you want\". I asked for a breakfast biscuit and she said they won't have any for at least 10 mins. I said \"that's fine and I'll wait\". She replied with \"so you still want one?\". I said \"yes\". She then told me my total and told me to pull up. I said I have other things I would like to order. Everytime I ordered one more item she would try to stop me from ordering more and rush me to the window. I had to repeat what I wanted 3 times. I paid and she handed us one drink but not my orange juice (which was the whole reason why I came). She said pull up front. I did that and waited. 15 mins later a staff member came out with our food. I asked if my orange juice was in there and it wasn't. I told him I ordered it. He went back in and came back out and said his boss said I didn't order it. I said just give me my money back then. His boss came out storming and said I didn't order it (even though I did 3 times). I just said please give me my money back. She then reached her arm in front of me in my car and pointed to the drink and said \"give me that\". I handed her the drink and she shoved the money at me and walked up to the trash can outside and threw the drink away and darted back in. I called the customer service number for this incident and I hope they do something about it"}
{"text":"This location is definitely better since they shut down and remodeled. There still are employees that ultimately seem like they only have one speed, but unfortunately you'll always have that in this industry.  There was one very friendly young woman during my last visit and that would surely make me want to come back in the near future.  Not much more to say. It's Burger King."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but it's a bunch of kids that are being unprofessional. When I came back to order something else, I apparently walked into a conversation and greatly disturbed them. They kind of looked at me like they didn't know why I came up to the counter.  I only come here when I have their coupons."}
{"text":"It was 11:40pm, there were two cars ahead of me. When we pulled the cars were being care of. We waited at the box for about 12 minutes until the person at the drive thru began our order.   I ordered a large #11 substitute for onion rings and nuggets and a extra drink. The total came out to $12.63. Mind you, that the #11 is the NEW spicy chicken sandwich.   We got in line for the second window to pay. And the first car in front of us got his food within 6-7 minutes. The car ahead of us pulled up. And literally took TWENTY MINUTES TO GET ONE FREAKING BAG!   At this point, I was already angry and just wanted to leave but the car in front of me sped off. So I thought when I pull and pay, my food would be ready.   I WAS WRONG!!!!!!  NOT ONLY DID WE NOT GET AN APOLOGY FOR THE LONG WAIT FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULDVE BEEN DONE WITHIN 10 MINUTES, BUT WE GOT A DRIVE THRU EMPLOYEE WHO STATED, \"Ugh, you got uhh large coke like ice and one with no ice? 12.63.\"   We waited 4 more minutes to get a bag that's completely wrong! First we got nuggets and fries. We told him that we wanted onion rings so he went to go get it. We noticed he gave us chicken fries and I said I wanted a spicy chicken. So he grabbed the bag out of my hand to replace it. It took another five minutes until he gave us a bag to replace our order.   WE CHECKED THE BAG, and it was stilll freaking wrong!  BY THE TIME WE LEFT THE DRIVE THRU, it was already 12:20am!!! THIS IS RIDICULOUS.   We ordered a Large Spicy Chicken combo w/ onion rings  and we received a large Chicken fries combo w/ fries.   We ordered 10 spicy nuggets and received COLD REGULAR NUGGETS   OUR SODAS WERE WATERED DOWN FOR WATING SO LONG.    ---------------------------------------------------  Peace of Advice from a former fast food Team Leader  If you have a car at the window and are fixing their order, please double check the next car's order to make sure it is right for having them wait so long.   Please have a friendlier drive thru employee that actually REPEATS THE ORDER TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND PLEASE GIVE THEM THEIR RECEIPTS.   If y'all are having a lot trouble getting orders out CORRECTLY then y'all need to re-evaluate your set up. Put your weakest employee on fryers and your strongest on grill. Make sure you have a friendly and bubbly employee at your drive thru. Especially someone who can handle the fast paced and demand of the drive thru.   Management, please make sure your employees are well trained before leaving them on their shifts by themselves. Some manager fail to realize that some people may need more time to be trained than other people.   You have one well deserved star. I came home unsatisfied with my meal and resulted into making more food at home.   Maybe y'all shouldn't be 24 hours when you can't handle the drive thru.   #SorryNotSorry"}
{"text":"Want bad service and cold food?  This is your place! My food sat in the window for at least 10 minutes while every employee just took more orders. Once they had my money, they didn't care."}
{"text":"This BK is perhaps not in the best area of town.  It is not the easiest for access - I think I have only been into it when I happen to stop at the Bargain Hunters or waiting on a repair at Mr. Inspection or something similar.  However, the actual location is not all that bad, it is just not made for easy access.  I think that may be the problem with many Burger King locations, as opposed to McDonald's nationwide, or even Bojangles in Charlotte (which you can find just a few hundred yards down the street).  Should you happen into this one, the location itself is generally kept decently clean, and the staff is usually friendly enough.  The place is almost always empty, perhaps because of the other issues."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this BK - it is, in fact a nice little place. It's barely larger than an express outlet, and they designed it to fit nicely into a small parcel of land in the parking lot, so it does what it is supposed to - supplies burgers (and associated fast food) just where you need them.  There are certainly a few other places to eat around the mall, and in fact if you drive just a bit further down the perimeter road you can get more fast food at Steak & Shake in one direction, or fancier foodstuffs and better views at Twin Peaks. But for a quick bite, BK does the trick."}
{"text":"Great service!! I've never had a problem at this location and I love that they have a small lounge area!!"}
{"text":"best. burger. king.  great made food (fish sandwich was tops!), funny and cheerful employees (i love you window guy!) and all around good vibes.  much love for this burger king."}
{"text":"Clean friendly nice interior basic fast food restaurant, fries were hot and crispy, coffee was dark and creamy, service friendly though I want her to speak to me in español but she replied in English must be a corporate thingy"}
{"text":"Decided to take advantage of Burger King 's 2/$6 chicken sandwich deal. I ordered at the drive thru and there was some confusion on the other end as I ordered but they got it right! The food was at a good temperature even after the drive home."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice to get breakfast. Service was very fast. Crossian-wiches were good ok."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would.  I lived around the corner from this place for 8 years.   It's consistently filthy.  The staff is typically rude.  The food is almost always disgusting (I DO like Burger King, but this restaurant is always gross)  There are a ton of other places to eat in the South Side... skip this place."}
{"text":"Employees and manager are very unprofessional.  I saw 2 on their phone and heard lots of profanity. Not a family friendly place. Food was slow to get. Tasted alright."}
{"text":"Third day trying to try your sausage and biscuits 9:45 am Once again told NO BISCUIT today sorry they say  Why do you promote something you don't have to sell? Okay we went to McDonalds they're we're so good as always"}
{"text":"Let me start off the fact that the service was excellent! However when we got home my kids and spent rest of the evening in the bathroom.  And we all went to bed with stomach pain! I don't think will be back for awhile.   Not trying to be funny the service was really good! It's a shame things turned out that way."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! We came here tonight and we were greeted with a terrible and disgruntled employee I ordered the #2, no sauce, extra pickles, on a seedless bun.i can't eat seeds! Guess what he says as he walked off \"dam I don't know why everybody has to order their food all special tonight\". I thought this was Burger King have it your way! I walked out without any words! Management needs to train their employees on customer service and etiquette before putting their employees in customer relations. I strongly advise you do not go to this Burger King location very rude, disrespectful employees. And may I add, unnecessary, extremely amount of smoke through out the whole building, like they have not changed their oil in the fryers for a good while.extremely disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I couldn't even finish my burger. It doesn't taste anything like the other BKs. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"This place used to be pretty awful. Then they got rid of the bitchy drive-through girl. Now, it's pretty decent. The staff is always friendly, and they've never, ever gotten my order wrong. Of course, I don't really ask for much...my diet consists of meat, cheese, and coffee these days. But most fast food joints still manage to screw that up, somehow. Not this BK. Which is nice, considering there aren't many other places to eat around here, so it's my favorite go-to on the days I'm too lazy (or sleep in too long) to pack my own lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered my fries with no salt and I got mushy ,salty fries. The guy told me to go eat somewhere else....gladly."}
{"text":"Went to the drive-thru food was cold. Service was good and fast as all drive-thrus no line"}
{"text":"Somehow this place screws up the franchised burger joint so badly that after experiencing the poor service and horribly prepared food, you'll wonder if you should drown yourself after you finish on the toilet. The elderly, very young, and clinically depressed should not eat at this Burger King."}
{"text":"The food is pricey but so is all the other food in any airport - whether it's a chain restaurant or one you have never heard of.  So I suggest you eat before heading to the airport, when you get to your destination, or you take snacks (just no liquids the airports will make you throw them away, even with an unbroken seal).  The location is big and shares it's space with other food vendors.  The burger king in terminal C is a little hidden, it's behind the restrooms, shoe shiner, starbucks, and at the very end of the boarded walkway - there's a lot of construction going on.  Absolutely no free refills as another yelper posted, there are 2 fountain drink dispensers in the lobby w/a big sticker stating refills $0.79 - maybe if it's crowded and the staff won't notice you but then again it's not worth it."}
{"text":"I will defintley be back the food came out fast the service was wonderfull ryan was a very nice and helping person and the inside pf the resturant was very very clean i wish i could give more then 5 stars for ryan s friendly customer service"}
{"text":"I hate Burger Kind in general so this might be a biased review, but I'm always disappointed at how much flavoring they must use on their meat and how many chemicals they mist put into their fries to make it seem like they have charbroiled burgers [because obviously they're not] and thick cut fries [because, obviously, they're not].   Their spicy chicken sandwich is pretty good but at what cost? I always wonder how much of their chicken is really chicken as well so I refrain to even indulge in that whether or not I'm in a hurry."}
{"text":"Newsflash Destiny. Customers dont want to hear about how you call your bf the mayor of pussy town. Or that you call him a MOFO. Or that you're so mean to him and \"he loves it\". Your managers should be ashamed to have you on their staff with a mouth like that. Maybe next time you want to talk to your co-workers about how awful you are to your bf you should close the drive through window."}
{"text":"99 cent burger for 3 dollars,  cold,  fries over Salted,  worst Bk ever.  Do not recommend it to anyone.  Edit manager was excellent and fixed situation."}
{"text":"Just like any other Burger King, except the cashier could have a bit nicer and maybe seem to enjoy her job... a smile goes a long way... I was standing in line and the gentleman ahead was ordering....he sounded like he was from Germany.... he asked for a sandwich and a drink, and the cashier seemed annoyed that he didn't know to say Combo... and when he asked for it to be put in a bag, she said in a cold voice \"we put everything in a bag as we don't have anything to put it on for dining in\".  Sometimes we need to remember we are ambassadors for people traveling from overseas...if this is their first impression of America, that is not good...if you don't like your job, find one you do like"}
{"text":"This location is very convenient. Their drive they is pretty speedy and I always get a great whopper here! The staff is kind. Bonus: if you take the survey on your receipt you can get a free whopper when you return. It's even easy because you can do it online."}
{"text":"THEY SUCK !!! Waited half an hour our fucking food wtf was that. Then the cashier asked my mom if she wanted the food back and the cashier said NO , idk what cashier was that but the employees there SUCK !!! Our food sat on the counter getting cold . Don't ask if somebody wants their food back if you ain't giving it back to them ! Negative stars !!"}
{"text":"This BK has been here for MANY years. It was old and run down. It looked dirty and became a hang out for questionable people. Recently they remodeled it. It is amazing!  Fresh and clean. They even added a huge TV. I went inside to eat to see the remodeling job. I ordered a whopper Jr meal. The Coke was mostly carbonation-yuck!  The whopper Jr. Looked smaller than the regular cheeseburger. It was good but tiny. The fries were good also.  I quit eating here for awhile but with the remodel I might go back."}
{"text":"I come here probably once a month or every other month. Service is kind of slow sometimes, but I'm take slow for fresh food. I really want to say, thank you, to Max. He was very nice to my outrageous sons, who were very loud & all over the place that day. As I was trying to hurry & leave, my baby had a mini meltdown down & her little foot kicked my newly refilled drink off the table. I would normal clean it myself, but my sons were just too much that day. Kids will be kids, but they were over doing it, I had to go. Max ended up cleaning it for me, which I totally appreciate. Some may feel its his job, but I'm an adult, plus I was taught growing up, you clean up what you mess up. Thank you, here's 5 stars for you!"}
{"text":"This is the Burger King that corporate forgot. The food is awful (which doesn't help because BK is generally nasty), service is slow, and the ice maker makes a weird slurping sound....like someones in there. This place has such a lousy reputation that the line around the half gas station McDonalds can be wrapped around twice and no one will wait at Burger King. King Nasty!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing first off on Google and on Burger King's website they are advertised to be open until midnight Monday thru Sunday but of course I get there at 11:05 p.m. at the drive-thru with the drive-through lights are completely lit up and myself and another customers sitting in the Drive-Thru waiting for assistance and all they do you say come on the microphone say sorry we're closed now. Lol epic fail. Otherwise every other time I have come to this restaurant has been awesome."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Very rude purple in there! They forgot to put something in my bag then have me an attitude when I went inside and asked for it. The last practically threw the bag at me. Never again."}
{"text":"food= same as others ketchup - spout napkins - 2 dispensers workers - greeted  this place has a kids playground. music - horrible xmas music - blah!"}
{"text":"Pulled up to drive thru, speaker not working well. I said one moment. When I said I was ready no reply- When I pulled up I was ignored until finally someone asks what I had. I said I havent even got a chance to order. I got parked."}
{"text":"The manager of this establishment should not be able to treat her employees the way she does. It's awful. She's embarrassing to herself and to BK. She went around yelling at and degrading every employee when I was in there. She's an awful evil person. The employees do not deserve that crap. I could barely order over this fat b word being rude to everyone... I'm also pretty sure the manager isn't supposed to walk around on the restaurant floor blabbering on her phone... She was making people scrub things on their hands and knees...  She's just a no. Don't keep. Don't subject people to her.   I was there sept 26 at 4pm"}
{"text":"Avoid this place in the airport. 20 minutes to wait for a standard order is not acceptable. I had to wolf down my food to make my flight when I should have had plenty of time. Epic fail BK, clean up your act."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. A worker named Alam (ew) tried to get with my boyfriend. He had extreme attitude when i announced out loud that he was straight. He messed up our order several times and smelled like uncooked Burger King fish sandwiches. Would not go again but would offer the man a mint."}
{"text":"Very disappointed and surprised at the level of service, communication and overall quality of food from this location. I visited Via the drive-through for one of BK's current promotions (Whopper and Chicken Sandwich; 2 for $5 deal) plus ketchup and a regular fry. Was told to pull around to the front of the establishment to park and wait; no prob.   Unfortunately, it took 16 minutes for the employee to finally bring my food out. And when I asked if the ketchup I ordered was in the bag, he confirmed it was.   When I checked the order upon arriving at my destination (less than a mile away), there was no ketchup, the Whopper was stone-cold and the Chicken Sammy was smashed like someone had sat on it. Not to mention, the Chicken Sandwich  included, literally, 4 small pieces of wilted lettuce; Lettuce was Brown. That sandwich was very stiff and seemed like it had been sitting out for some time. The only item that was hot was the regular fry; however, there were just a few fries in the carton and there was actually a mini onion ring included by mistake.  When I immediately called in to provide qualitative feedback on the food and order, I got voicemail. Left 5 or more messages over a period of several weeks and no response from Burger King. Also, just now called and a voicemail option is not even possible because \"Memory is full\". So there you go. Not cool.  Extremely poor service, food quality and dining experience."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible.   Slow and unable to complete a special order.  I waited forever for my chicken sandwich but they still got it wrong!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by here yesterday and wow what a change. Must be new management in charge. My food was fresh, I got it fast and the staff was super friendly. Such an improvement. I will be back and recommend to anyone needing a quick snack."}
{"text":"My experience at this Burger King was mediocre. I would have to say the best part of this visit was the convenience of being located inside the airport. The staff members were friendly when they spoke to me, but were very busy chatting with other members that worked there. I got the fish sandwich and it was so-so. It was not very hot, and neither were the french fries. But I guess what can you expect from a chain in an airport?"}
{"text":"Service was decent, and order is correct about 75% of the time, but the play place is always a mess. On this particular day there was a drink spilled inside & no one cleaned it up, they just left the wet, sticky mess for the kids to trample through. If you are stopping here because there's a play place-- DON'T."}
{"text":"This BK is a mile from my house and therefore more convenient than Mickey D's; however, I won't be going there any more because their service and food have gone downhill. For the last three times I went to get a sausage biscuit and each time the tasteless biscuit just fell apart. The sausage patty was burned near black and dry. There will be no more of that fare for me. I also wanted to get their 3-pancake order, which had been 89 cents. Not any more: they upped it, oh, just a tad to ... $2.79!!! SERIOUSLY???? And the girl at the register was a total sourpuss - didn't act polite or crack a smile even though I was the only customer they had at 7:30 (Gee, I wonder why ...). I'm done with this chain."}
{"text":"They had me waiting 15 mins for this!!! It literally looks like they threw it in the microwave? I just called and the manager and he wasn't even apologetic and seemed more annoyed. DONT COME HERE!"}
{"text":"3 times in a row:  One of the employees were nice but this is not benefiting the campaign for $15 an hour.  1: completely wrong sandwich 2: asked for a grilled chicken breast and somehow got crap chicken fries 3: asked for an ultimate breakfast platter and got 1 sausage, 3 pancakes with a piece of cheese melted to the top pancake.   My son is 8 and knows how to make food. Is yall hirig or is you employing?"}
{"text":"Stop here for a couple of times. Centi is very friendly,  she surprised me with her service for a fast food place.  Came back for the 2nd time because of her. Glad to see someone's happy with with what they do!!"}
{"text":"I'm good on this place. They gave me a small fry instead of a medium. But the kicker is when I asked for ketchup, the worker said, \"we are out of ketchup.\" *record scratch* huh?!?! Get it together. One star."}
{"text":"I am sad to say this went from my favorite BK to the worst! I don't go to the fast food drive thru very often, but when I do, I shoot for this place. In the recent past, I've had excellent service (during the weekday). Tonight and two Saturdays ago, horrible. I thought I'd give it another try tonight because I've had such great luck there. I ordered a Whopper with cheese with extra mayo and ketchup, doesn't seem too complex to me.. After waiting at the window a couple minutes, I was asked to pull around to the other side and they'd bring my food out. Not a big deal at this point. A different guy runs my food out. I drive away and then notice it's wrong. I go back to the window and waited a few more minutes. At this point I just want my money back. I've heard too many horror stories of what some people do when you return food. The guy manning the window was fine. The problem I have was the manager in duty. He handed me my money and said have a nice day. All I really wanted was a simple apology. I looked at him for a second and he ever so insincerely said sorry..he called me mean and shut the window as I started to pull away. I couldn't believe how rude this kid was. So I wasted 22 minutes, was still hungry, and now late for my appointment. In search of a new BK..."}
{"text":"Haven't had a WOOPER in a long time, and I tell my self, ''why not''? It's about time and the right place. Arrived there, 6/05/17 about 6:30 pm Ordered a wooper with cheese, (the meal) At first place look kinda crazy, wasn't sure what I was gonna get.... ...man!! THE WOOPER WAS DELICIOUS AND THE FF CRISPY. had it with a Vanilla Dr Pepper, I tell you what... NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL, THEY TOOK THE TIME TO MAKE IT RIGHT, I AM VERY SATISFIED! WILL GO BACK ANYTIME!!"}
{"text":"I like this Burger King the best out of all the BK's in the area. The interior is clean with employees actively maintaining it and the service is good, and the play area actually smells and looks CLEAN. The food quality is also better at this location. No complaints from me."}
{"text":"Needed to post something about this Burger King because of the service, not necessarily the food this time. Who do they hire at these places? Where do they find them? Don't put someone at the register that doesn't know what they're doing. The poor manager was running around like a chicken with its head cut off and the guy at the register was taking his sweet time. All I ordered was a whopper meal with cheese and ketchup only, this must have been too much to comprehend! It took 3 times asking me what I wanted before he punched it in correctly. It still didn't show right on the receipt so I told him to just change the order to Chicken Fries to be safe...I know there can't be any real chicken in those, but they're just soooo darn good! Get some new people working for you and you should be good to go!"}
{"text":"The service here is bad at best. The drive through attendant was unpleasant and I didn't even get a receipt."}
{"text":"How dare they not put cheese on my croissan'wich?"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!!! I ordered (and was charged for) an order of chicken fries with ranch sauce, a hamburger meal, and a vanilla ice coffee.   the hamburger was correct, I'll give them that. The fries were cold. I got an EMPTY chicken fry box, no ranch sauce, and the \"vanilla ice coffee\" was a chocolate milk.  I could understand if they were busy and messed the order up because of a rush, but I was the only one in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Wopperitto is nasty, my onion rings are hard old and chewey, didnt get my katsup or my onion ring sauce, surprising because the  drive thru lady OFFERED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!! Damnit now i cant even choke this crap down with anything."}
{"text":"Fried mac n cheese inside of a cheeto...amazeballs. i wish they could bring back the big king soon. I love there onion rings! I mean i know its just fast food but this location  is so fresh always."}
{"text":"Ate a Halloween whopper it was yummy except for the fact it's dripping in steak sauce? Also really you should not eat it because I pooped green for 2 days!! Iam sorry if that was too much info but seriously people that can't be good for you!! And Iam not the only one look it up it's on Google!!!!"}
{"text":"Arghhh, work dragged me up here and I had 10 minutes for lunch and had to grab something ASAP.  The \"healthy\" chicken sandwich I ordered might as well have been rubber and I couldn't stop thinking about how many chemicals they had to pump into that thing to preserve it and form it together.  I went home and juiced that night to apologize to my body....."}
{"text":"When in need of an ice cream cone and have no other nearby options this was a great, quick place to go. $1.00 for a cone (could have had a little more on the one). Tasted great, very creamy mix."}
{"text":"Typical Burger King, I usually only go for breakfast sandwiches if I'm running late to work."}
{"text":"This review is for the memorial location...but for some reason I can't find it on here.  Stopped by here while out for a ride on the motorcycle, ordered food sat down decided that after many hours riding that I would need to have a small stop at the little boys room...opened the door and it looked like a homeless person was living in the stall. Needless to say I left the bathroom and proceeded to tell my riding partner that I guess I would have to head home soon as the urge was very urgent.  a few minutes later I see a young man leave the bathroom...now the urge is REALLY urgent and I am resigned to using the bathroom...and behold used needle containers and medical wipes...yay. I came out of the bathroom mentioned that people were using the bathroom to do needle drugs and all I got were blank stares.  food was hot...not exactly what I ordered...but hot."}
{"text":"It blows my mind to experience the kind of incompetence that this Burger King location offers. After seeing the commercial about the new flame grilled hotdogs I had to try them...what a mistake. The hotdogs themselves were actually not bad but had they been hot, I might have been happier with them. Cold fries and lukewarm onion rings rounded out a thoroughly disgusting fast food meal. To top it all, they forgot my chicken fries. I should have checked the bag; oh well, live and learn. Bottom line, avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"The last time three times through the drive thru I've been asked to pull around front and have the food brought out, even when there was no one behind me.  The last time I went there (about four days ago) I was asked to pull around and after waiting fifteen minutes I gave up and went inside to find out where my order was. They had no idea.  I see no reason to tell people to pull around the building when there is no one behind them. And what really frosted me the last time was watching other people who came later through the drive thru get their orders at the window and drive away. I saw at least five that got their meals at the window without being asked to pull around."}
{"text":"My conscience has been bothering me about my original review, because a friend made me go here again and this time there were no flies. Also the gentleman behind the counter was super busy but took the time to explain that the reason we hadn't been able to find Spicy Chicken Nuggets was because that item had been discontinued and wasn't available anywhere."}
{"text":"I dont enjoy going to fast food restaurants for one reason only but i figure i try this place to puck up food for the grandpa. This Burger King has given me by far the worst customer service I have ever received.  They forgot to give us sauce so I kindly said hey can I can have some sauce you forgot the sauce... he rudely said \"so?what you want\"   I said wow...   If you work at a place that is about to great customer service and dont want to provide it then do not work there.  Customer service 1/5"}
{"text":"Beyond irritated with Fast Food. We came here thinking we would have a better experience than McDonalds. Nope just as bad. Had to go back for my sons ice cream cone and when we got home and checked our bag one of MY SONS 10 piece nuggets were NOT in the bag. Is it that hard to read the screen? No it is not. Now my 6 year old and 9 year sons are sharing ONE 10 piece nuggets. Ridiculous. Thanks Burger King. I guess we will stick with McDonald's."}
{"text":"Sloooooooooooooowwwwwwwww and dirty rather spend the extra bucks and have Carl's Jr. across the st."}
{"text":"Can I give no stars??? I'm sitting in here in the drive thru anticipating fast food and it seem to be only one person working in this whole establishment!!! Oh wait there's another person, wait there's another person. Let me correct myself there are three people total working here it seems.  This is the slowest drive thru experience ever.  I waited to place my order in drive thru. Waited while the other cars were serviced and waited while my simple order was completed. My order was simple -10 piece chicken nugget with ranch dipping sauce. Not sure why I had to wait 20 minute. If I wasn't locked in between cars I would have left. I will probably never stop here again."}
{"text":"Average location. Clean, drive thru is a little slow, but employees are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch because it looked fairly new and it was convenient. This was the first time I actually threw my food in the garbage rather than wait in line again to complain. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Tried these losers again, only because my son begged me. Maria rang up my egg & cheese croissant breakfast meal....$8.91.....really? When I questioned the amount, she told me it was right and showed me the cash register. Well, you can't fix STUPID! We left, unfed."}
{"text":"Average location. Only used drive thru. Speed was OK, order was right. In a strip mall close to other stores. Convenient."}
{"text":"Nothings changed here. Walked up to order breakfast, and the \"manager\" and crew members just ignored me. Guess why? They were discussing how to increase sales! Priceless."}
{"text":"Waited about 20 minutes...it's ok, I have time, no hurry at all.  For my order, a Bacon King, yes a 9.50 Burger King meal. Which is one of the most expensive things on the menu. Just one thing, there's no BACON. Not one piece on my burger. I feel like I got screwed because I literally got 2 patties, ketchup and mustard and a bun with fries for basically 10 bucks. Slow, inaccurate service that took advantage of me. The person taking my order handed me my order so quickly I should have known something was wrong with it. Hire different people to go with that remodel. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Just came here cause I was craving a burger, I was actually pretty stoked to be grabbing a whopper since I haven't had one in a while. I get it, It's Burger King. Who the hell hire these front cashier? The cashier behind the counter pretty much did not give me a second to look over the menu as I just arrived. Right off the bat the lady raised her voice stating the debit machine (all) is out and what do I want. I mentioned the special that is clearly plastered on the windows and mentioned the chicken nuggets that bk.ca have for sale, they said \"NO, it's 2.99 and not 1.99\".  I kind of lost it and told her if she couldn't handle the customer service it's advisable to not lash out on customers. Will not frequent this Burger King ever again. Harvey's and even McDonalds have way better service and will withhold their obligation of advertisement error."}
{"text":"This BK stinks like throw up and shit. Their burgers were bland and not so tasty at all."}
{"text":"It's burger King. That's it. A little more expensive than in the outside world but reasonable, under $5 for a burger. If you like burger King you'll like this."}
{"text":"Out of the last three times I have gone through the drive thru in the morning, my order has been wrong.  My order cannot be easier!  A junior bacon and egg burrito, no cheese, no sauce, only bacon, egg, and hashbrowns inside.  I order it just like that.  The first time, it had sauce in it and I had to go back.  The next time it was correct and this morning, it has sausage in it.  I go back, I tell them, please take out the sausage and put bacon in it.  Instead of just doing that they make me go park out front.  The girl finally brings it out and she tells me it is right.  I don't check it.  I get back to the office and it has bacon but no hashbrowns.  WTF???  How hard is it people??  I try to call and you don't answer your phone.   You guys SUCK!"}
{"text":"Getting better.  The food is finally served hot and only with an occasional mistake.  The employees are friendly but not overly so but they smile and thank you.  I really want to get this to a 4-star rating as this is my local place.  I hope they keep improving."}
{"text":"Very poor service! Inattentive and rude. They allowed two people to cut in front of me, the signage was misleading about what qualifies as a meal, and the clerk walked away for over a minute as soon as I reached the front. Find somewhere else to get breakfast."}
{"text":"Yummy food and great customer service I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family and yummy food"}
{"text":"Gross gross gross the burgers were so nasty and tasted like they were boiled. Its was so tasteless and had a weird texture. When I asked for a refund, the dude behind the counter was extremely rude. He just threw me a dollar and walked away!!! I will never go back."}
{"text":"The food ordered was ok...chicken fries.  The drive through experience and professionalism was horribly lacking.  This BK had two lines to order.  We waited in one line, but could not order   because the person taking the order had an open mic on their headset.  We tried yelling into the order box, but they could not hear us.  There were at least three people on the other side talking about a lot of \"non\" BK stuff.  Very unprofessional.    We moved to the other line and finally got to order.  The wait in the drive through line was 16 minutes...from 7:20pm placing my order to 7:36pm in finally getting to the window to get my order.  What's the back up folks?  So much for \"fast\" food.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Visited this location as it is conveniently located inside Square One.   The purpose of the visit was just to get the buffalo chicken fries. The fries took a couple minutes to serve.  Even after the wait the chicken fries were not fresh. It was old, stale and lukewarm. It was not crispy at all and tasted soggy. So disappointed. The chicken fries were so good at the other location.    Sigh. They serve old food.    Next time ask for \"fresh chicken fries\". This will allow you to get hot and freshly cooked chicken fries...."}
{"text":"Feel like this place makes better chicken fries than the square one location. Every time I order chicken fries from here, they are always fresh. So there's always a wait. They only fry the chicken fries when you order, which is good.   The burgers here are also pretty decent for a fast food restaurant. Not sure why there's so many bad reviews."}
{"text":"Driving down central about to head to another lunch location when the driver starts talking about Burger King and whoppers, so you know we had to find the nearest Bk. The taste of the whopper is so good and unique. Plus I haven't had one in a while.   Upon arriving to this location, it is not busy at all, and the parking lot is empty but that doesn't stop our Whopper journey. It is a dated Bk but playing some good tunage!  The man who took our order was very nice and seemed happy to have a customer We both got whoppers and I actually opted for the double whopper, don't judge me, haha  I didn't know that they got the new Coca Cola machines. I think they're like \"free style\" super cool and so many flavors. I was happy to see Cherry Coke.   Since the Bk isn't busy our good was made from scratch which is kinda neat The whopper is nice, fresh, and hot  Totally good The fries are super fresh which is very uncommon at any fast food joint :)  This was such a good last second choice and a total money saver :)"}
{"text":"Went in around 2 p.m. and not a soul in the place.  Waited at the counter for someone to acknowledge I was even in the store and, no one did.  While I stood stupidly, my wife tried to find a clean table to sit at and did not find any!  Place was filthy!  Then from somewhere, an uninterested young man, in the filthiest uniform, popped up to ask me\"do you need to order?\"  I looked around and decided, no, I do not need to order.  Went to Wendy's.  And, I ain't going to come back."}
{"text":"What can I say it's Burger King so pretty sure you know what to expect. Major plus is that its a pretty new location and the food is what you would expect. Happy that it's nearby and I don't have any complaints from my first visit."}
{"text":"What can I say it's Burger King so pretty sure you know what to expect. Major plus is that its a pretty new location and the food is what you would expect. Happy that it's nearby and I don't have any complaints from my first visit."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Burger King I have ever been to. They have never once had the milkshake machine up anytime of day i went there. The last time I was here they told me they were out of food I had already paid for and couldn't refund my money so I had choose something else that I didn't want. I am very disappointed in this place especially since they just remodeled...... what a waste of money"}
{"text":"Bunch of teenagers just messing around and cursing. A guy started taking my order by saying \"What do you want\".... I know that it's Burger King and not chick fila but really??? What do you want?? I want a nice person taking my order is what I want! On top of that, I waited a little over 15 minutes for my food. I figured I was waiting so long in the drive thru because I was going to get fresh food but nope  my chicken nuggets were so stale. Disappointed but not too surprised lol-- take your money else where."}
{"text":"Do not ever order delivery through grub hub from here.  It never gets delivered!! THIS IS THE 2ND TIME I HAVE CANCELLED.. I only gave it one star because I had to pick a star"}
{"text":"Good location with excellent staff! My daughters school does fundraiser nights here often. Always a great experience here!"}
{"text":"It's a burger king, but the serving station here is always a complete mess, can't say I expect too much from a Burger King, but get it together. There are only 2 steps down to the lowest of the established chains, and skates dangerously close to that. Shakes here are really good but the food is a different story, wilted lettuce, crushed buns and cold food. Just use the chain guidelines and you'll be fine"}
{"text":"The South Side Burger King--if you're hungry and you're in the South Side, chances are this Burger King is closed.  Decades ago, I'm sure this location flourished. Unfortunately, the outdated branding and incessant loitering has ripped this once King from his throne.  Dissatisfied with a $9 lunch that I bought at a local establishment, I thought I'd spend a few bucks on cheap grub at Burger King to satiate my need for quick, greasy, delicious fast food. The front door was closed, and there was a sign posted--\"Please Use Side Entanc.\" We entered using the side entrance, and were greeted by blacked out LCD screens. Only one of them seemed to be on, and it was adorned with a floating \"SOLD OUT\" screensaver.  The menu was printed and taped to the counter. It was heavily stained with grease and pop. \"Chicken nuggets and french fries,\" I thought to myself. \"Chicken nuggets and french fries,\" I repeated out loud.  Another customer ahead of me inquired about the french fries. \"That's all we have, they're not sending us the other kind anymore,\" the manager said. Steak cut. Obviously frozen. My mother used to get ones just like it at Costco. The chicken nuggets came out. They weren't the usual crowns--oh, no. They were nostalgic of my elementary school lunch chicken nuggets. I asked for barbeque sauce, and the manager rushed around back and grabbed a plastic high-ball glass before filling it up with Sweet Baby Ray's.  The radio blasted 80s dance music before shifting to Simon and Garfunkel. Hello, darkness, my old friend.  The solemn faces, crying children, and disgruntled coworkers around me validated my conclusion--Hell exists, and it is the South Side Burger King."}
{"text":"No custermor service, out of stuff and can't up grade to larger size, is what don't even want; why come here"}
{"text":"My children and I got three Whoppers only to find the cheese was not melted on the bun"}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero, if the option was available. Came here to try the Fruit Loop milkshake but didn't see the option on the menu at all. In the drive-thru my boyfriend asks, \"Do you have any new milkshakes?\" The answer we get back verbatim is, \"New milkshakes? ....(long pause)...vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, Oreo...oh yeah, Fruit Loop.\" We obviously order the Fruit Loop. He asks if we want whip cream & we say no. He reads back the order, \"Fruit Loop milkshake, no whip cream.\" Correct.   Drive up, pay & we get a Fruit Loop milkshake WITH whip cream, no customer service whatsoever & although the flavor of the shake is great, it is so thick you can't get any out of the straw. We needed a spoon, so basically we got ice cream...not a shake. Definitely never going back to this location again."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner because there were limited options during the holidays. It looks like a lot of people thought the same cuz this place was packed.    This bk is,huge!  The first floor was,packed so we went downstairs and found more tables. It's true they don't empty their garbage cans because it was overflowing upstairs.  However, it was cleaner downstairs.   They messed up our order so we had a bit of a wait. Food is what you get at a bk. No complaints here"}
{"text":"Burger King in the giant mall. We came in late so this was our only option unless we wanted food that's been sitting on a warmer for hours.  Asked for a kid burger. Nope they don't have any. Asked for milk, they don't have that either. My fish burger was lukewarm for some reason. Fries were hot and not overly salted. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 4 times and they got my order wrong 3 times AND made me late returning from lunch. I don't expect much, I mean it's not Le Cordon Bleu but it's not rocket science either. I go out of my way to avoid fast food but had time constraints on my visits so had no alternative.   The last guy at the window was in a spectacular mood. So much so that I was prompted to ask him if he was medicated and if so, to give me his doctor's phone number. He laughed and said he loves his job. Wrap your mind around that. He amused me for the rest of my time in the Gulag that pays my bills. He got my order right for a change so I was pleased."}
{"text":"To the morning crew today, I know. I'm not a morning person either. Just please don't make it worse for the both of us. I would've let this pass if the food was okay. Unfortunately for everyone, the food doesn't even pass for a food. Even my dog wouldn't eat it. Kudos to the lady who handed out the order though. She gave us the fakest thank you as she hurries back in. She's actually trying."}
{"text":"I rarely have fast food, but my daughter had to be at an early morning event and I was famished. I decided I'd come here because I DETEST McDonald's and I like their iced coffees (originally \"Mocha Joes\").  The bacon was burned on my breakfast sandwich and the iced coffee tasted like I made it myself (the reason I don't)  needless to say I was disappointed and like I said, I rarely do fast food, we're talking maybe 4 times a year."}
{"text":"If there was a no start rating I would give it. I didn't even order since the person in charge of the drive through was so rude. I didn't even get to completed my order when she was already talking over me. She didn't even greet us. I was not going to spend money I earn on a place that doesn't even greet me and make me feel welcome. It's sad ;I wonder how many people have not spend there hard earn money here just because they have people working that hate there job and take it out on there customers. If you want great customer service don't go here!!!"}
{"text":"If I could do no stars I would. This place has the worst service ever!! I literally pulled out of the drive thru mid ordering because the guy taking our order was extremely rude and laughing while not paying attention to what I was trying to order. Never will I come to this location again."}
{"text":"Airport food is airport food, not the best and kind of expensive. But when your here you have no choice. Went cause I was craving a whopper. But as soon as I got there I should have stopped and turned back around to look for something else. There was a man infront of me who had complained about his burger, I should have token that as a sign. But no. I ordered a whopper with extra onions (which is $1 extra)  and went my gate . Which was a pretty far walk from their only Burger King location. Take a bite of it and its cold and only find two slices of onion. I was really upset because I had to pay extra for it. And also, who doesn't put any pickles in a burger. If your burger on the screen is advertised with pickles, I'm sure it needed to have pickles. Never again will I go there. I will happily walk myself to the E gates to get Carl's jr."}
{"text":"Okay so I've been to plenty of Burger Kings over the years, as I am an avid fast food lover. But this one just didn't meet my standards. If you're wondering why, continue reading.  When I walked in, I smelt a distinct scent, and it was very unpleasant to say the least. It was none other than the smell of foot fungus. How I know what that smells like, do not ask. Anywho, I continue into the restaurant and walk up to the register, ready to order my favorite meal. (It's the number 15, if you were wondering. Best thing on the menu, from an avid burger king fan.) The cashier asked for my order, but I was caught off guard by what I had witnessed in the back of the establishment. There was a tall, weird man. Who. Had. His. Feet. In. The. Bins. Of. Lettuce. I was highly confused, but this may have been just an odd ritual that this establishment practiced in. So I ordered my #15 as usual.   Once I received my burger, ready to get nice and thick, I get ready to take my first bite. But a smell hits me very off guard. It was the horrid, horrendous smell of FOOT FUNGUS. IN MY BURGER KING BURGER. I screech in disappointment and run out as quick as possible. Had I been infected by foot fungus?"}
{"text":"1st location whos breakfast hours dont match with company policy. Reason why I go to Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"Not sure if they know that restaurants like this are called fast food for a reason.  They're not called \"hey my buddy is hungry again because by the time he got his food and ate it, he digested it and started to get hunger pains by the time my food was ready.\"  It's probably to long to fit in the title.  Once again I reiterate that the food service industry in the entirety of the Phoenix area is complete crap.  If it's not the horrible customer service it's staff's inability to get an order correct.  I am writing this no exaggeration, 20 minutes after my order and I just got my food.  I could have gone to a much nicer sit down restaurant and had been faster.  It was frustrating since some of my coworkers are on limited lunch times. Watching the three girls stare at the lack of food entering the hot window like watching snow on a TV set.  In the time they stood there watching, doing nothin, one or two of them could have gone and helped the single guy making the food which in itself was like water torture how slow and bumbling he was. No idea where the manager was or who it was. And yes they still screwed up the order.  Apparently bacon whoppers don't come with bacon anymore.  Never go here.  Burger King, have some pride in your brand for crying out loud.  Someone needs to be fired.  The crowd of pissed off customers alone was ridiculous."}
{"text":"So it is a Burger king, you can expect too much, but in my experience BK is usually a slightly better then other fast food options.  It is very very hard for me to find food I can eat at any restaurant much less a fast food place due to extreme dietary restrictions. I went to get dinner for my family which we do once a week or so when we are lazy and don't want to cook. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich for myself with no dressing or sauce or mayo, and the rest or my family's order. I get home and the sandwich did indeed have no dressing or mayo or sauce on it, but it was a fried crispy sandwich, which would be worse for me then the sauce. so I have to find other food at home."}
{"text":"I normally am not a lunch eater.  I usually just sit and read my book on lunch, and rarely dine on anything.  Lately though, I have been eating out a little bit more for some reason, and today was no exception.  When I got off the light rail this morning, I spotted this BK on the way into the office.  I was like OMG must go here for lunch!  Despite it being 112 outside today, I did the walk from the AZ center anyways.  The place is decent considering its a BK.  Food was fine, tasty as always.  BUT, what I did notice was that in order to use the bathroom, you had to have a token, which can be aquired from the staff behind the counter!  I assume its to keep homeless people out.  I can't blame them!  Interesting though.  Anyways, will probably be back in the future, after it stops being so hot outside."}
{"text":"This location is VERY hit or miss. Mostly miss. I stop here on occasion if I'm in a hurry because they're one of the few fast good places that has a veggie burger. Sometimes it's okay, but sometimes it's as hard as a hockey puck. I decided to stop by for breakfast, thinking, \"how can you mess up breakfast?\"... well the figured it out. My entire sandwich wad cold the whole way through, and my hashbrowns had so much salt that I couldn't eat them. By time I got to eating, I was too far away to turn back and complain to them."}
{"text":"Over priced but the croissants are great. The combo meal was almost $9 partially because they make you purchase the large drink. I guess overall it's cheaper and better than buying snacks, sandwich, etc on the plane."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru, ordered two 5 piece chicken strips. Drove away, got on freeway headed out of town. As my daughter opened box we discovered they gave us two orders of 10 piece chicken nuggets.   How can you confuse an order of 5 with an order of 10.....  I had to get off freeway and return them. As soon as she saw me she KNEW why I was there. I never had to say what was wrong.  She did agree to adding a order of fries free of charge.    There is a huge price difference between the two different orders."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly here , cashier very thoughtful we had the coupon for buy one get one free sandwich and we got a whopper and veggies. he did the most expensive one for free. Food is great and fast. Will come back Again !!"}
{"text":"Great update to your facility, it needed it. As I am used to only getting either my fries hot or my sandwich hot, generally neither at the same time. I was really dissatisfied that not one was hot enough to eat. I physically left my whole meal and tray on the table and walked out. No amount of ketchup could make me eat it.   Hope they find a great staff so they can warrant spending the money on the upgrade.   I will probably not go back to this location again."}
{"text":"It really feels like there should be a sub-category of fast food called Slow Food. STRUGGLE BUS. Guys, I'm STILL waiting here for my order...18 minutes after I pulled through the drive thru. When I finally got my order taken and pulled up to pay, homegirl was texting. I waited about 2 minutes for her to look up to take my credit card. Blood pressure. Rising.   Never, ever, again. Just say no to this place."}
{"text":"This place would have received a 4 star rating from me, but I have noticed a change in the way they service walk-in customers. I doesn't seem to matter if there are 5 people waiting in line, they will wait on drive-thru customers first. This was not the case a year ago.. not sure what changed??? As far as food, it's Burger King!... I personally have not received anything bad, given the menu choices.. remember, it's Burger King. The service priority is my only grumble. However, I will say the staff is very friendly. But go to the drive-thru if you want quick service!"}
{"text":"Was driving by and decided to stop in and get some French toast sticks and a sausage biscuit. Have always been a fan of their French toast sticks.  I should have known when I saw only one person sitting inside that it was a sign!  Not sure why I waited three minutes for my food! The French toast sticks were barely warm and the sausage biscuit had been sitting around so long under the heat lamp that the biscuit had gotten too hard. Too hard to even eat!   The only reason I left two stars instead of the one that they deserve is that they have a really cool plane hanging from the ceiling in the dining area. You don't see that every day! Very cool!"}
{"text":"Customer service is non existed in this location, not basing my rating on one visit but many many visits something will always be wrong either with your food the time it takes to get your food but the big one is customer service nonexistent and today will be my last day ever doing business with a Burger King. Order my food through the drive-thru i said can I get a number one with a coke she asked me what size in a very rude way and I said small even before I got done saying the word she gave me the total and to pull up to the window I was planning to order more items and I told her I'm not done here and she replied even more rude\" then why don't you order\"  at that point I was done just drove off the drive-thru I'll take my business and money elsewhere went to  Carl's jr. across the street they treated me with respect and courtesy and asked me if I wanted anything else with my order and thank me for my business I be going from now on to Carl's jr. i  will be telling my friends and family and co-workers not to ever visit  this location"}
{"text":"The workers here took over twenty minutes to take a simple drive-through order.  The girl was so rude and trashy acting that I actually left the drive-thru and called the restaurant and to let the manager know.  Ugh."}
{"text":"The food is usually great but today they barely put any egg on my egg and cheese croissants. The egg was thin and a tiny little flattened ball in the middle, it didn't even cover the whole croissant nor was the egg thick either. When I returned my egg and cheese croissants and asked for more egg (and showed the woman at the order window how lacking it was), all I got was an extreme amount of attitude. She tossed them in the trash and told us to pull forward as they needed to make more egg. She forgot my orange juice so I politely asked for it before pulling forward, and then I asked for a straw since she didn't give me one and she had an attitude the whole time. As we pulled away, I heard her blow a raspberry as a final act of annoyance with us. It was extremely childish.   We waited 10 minutes or more for the food to arrive again, only to see the extremely thin egg barely spread across the croissant all over again. The french toast sticks were disgusting and hard as a rock, as if they had been left in the fryer for hours. I ended up just giving up and leaving as I was over bothering with trying to get decent food. This was the second time the french toast sticks were hard as a rock in the span of a week or so and that coupled with the attitude today was enough for me. Avoid the drive thru if the latina lady with blonde-ish hair is working the window as she's the one with a terrible attitude. I'm over the poor service and the at times mediocre food so I'll be going back to the Burger King by my old house over this one."}
{"text":"Gross, dry food.. Tasted like it was sitting out all day. They were really fast on handing my order out too, less than a minute in the drive thru for a 4 for $4, a large fry, and chicken fries?? How could you make all of that fresh in less than a minute? Oh wait they just grab it off the counter where it's been sitting all day. Also asked for \"a lot\" of ranch and buffalo sauce and she gave me one of each!!! (One sauce for a 9 piece and a 4 piece?!) never coming here again!!!"}
{"text":"So yes, I only gave it 3 stars, but that has to do with the quality of the product. The quick and responsive employees displayed a level of professionalism that was rather on-point. However, the food at this particular Burger King, was sub-par. Idk if they got a bad batch of chicken or what, but holy cow it was bad. The lettuce was yellow, the tomato came in only one slim slice, and the breading was just...off. Honestly, it tasted like it was an old piece of meat that when fried, just became a really crumbly piece of supposed \"white meat.\" It was kinda gross, but unfortunately for me, I was terribly starved and had already spent the 6$.   Calories are calories, but holy cow, I don't think I'm going to ever order the fried chicken sandwich from this place again. If the team of peeps at this place weren't so diligent I'd lower my rating. In summary, great service, but unfortunately, well-below-average eats."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes in the drive thru nust to get fries. 8 of the the minutes had been spent waiting that my order taken."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Service is good with friendly employees. The food, although not the beat does taste good and is fresh.  While there I had the angry whopper. Im not a fan of thick french fries, but theirs was still good.   What I liked most was their choices of soda. They have \"orange coke\" flavored soda. I never even heard of it before, so I had to try and and wow. Was it good.    Sadly the whole time I was thinking there they never swept the floor that needed it. Yeah its a small thing and I am not going to eat off it, but visually it is not appealing. The same is true of their bathroom floor."}
{"text":"Digamos que antes de que aparezcan las otras cadenas de comida chatarra (Wendy's y Mostaza) ésta era mi preferida.  Fui la semana pasada y me sorprendí con la comida. Siempre me pido el stacker doble porque lo amo, me lo dan y no era como lo recordaba. Era mas chico de lo normal y encima la carne de la hamburguesa super finita. Burger SIEMPRE se destaco por tenes las hamburguesas mas gruesas pero ahora veo que se esta convirtiendo en Mc Donalds...  Y le pongo 2 estrellas porque el delivery que tienen no llega a mi casa POR MEDIO METRO, si como leyeron, no me entregan porque tienen que doblar a la esquina (ya que mi edificio tiene dos entradas) y no cubre su periodo de delivery..."}
{"text":"Went late for some food. Guys in the drive thru seemed uninterested that I was ordering. Forgot sauces that I had asked for, and were kind of rude when I was trying to order. Maybe just don't go there after all when they are slow."}
{"text":"Would've been ZERO.  Supposed to be open at 6am. Nobody responded at 6:30am when I arrived. So I left after waiting 10minutes. Bunch of lazy workers. Caught them All napping"}
{"text":"The customer service had declined over the past year on the late night shift.  Very disappointed in how customers ate treated.  I understand young ppl need jobs but you can't Forego common courtesy.  The young lady needs an attitude adjustment BAD!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of BK - I need a little more meat in my burgers than they like to give you. But this place is cool simply because of the soda machine is a freak of nature. Our hotel was not far away (outside the strip) so it was easy to get to. Food was good for BK food service was ok since the place was empty inside every time we went."}
{"text":"My first visit - the chicken nuggets were dry and they forgot the sauce. Sauce might have made them edible but without the sauce, they were so dry, they were inedible. My second visit a week later, the girl had a bad attitude and did not listen to my order. I specified no salt on the french fries and no ketchup on the burger. When I picked up my order, I asked her if there was no salt on the fries and no ketchup on the burger because it wasn't written on the receipt. She accused me of not saying I didn't want salt. I had to wait again for both items to be redone. Notice that there was nobody else in the restaurant. When the redo was done, I asked for the honey mustard sauce. She played games with me. She didn't want to give it to me. After practically arguing with her for several minutes and her attempts to give me plain mustard, that I do not like nor eat, she finally gave me what I asked for.  She was not pleasant about it.  She was also inappropriately dressed with tight leggings too long for her, all hiked up and no skirt, no long shirt, no tunic, nothing covering the leggings, just bare sloppy leggings.  She looked dreadful and her attitude sucked.  It was my second visit and I won't go back, except for freebies that come in the mail.  I don't care to be treated like that and when only one couple came in while I was waiting for my order, I would hate to think how she would handle herself in a busy restaurant. She had a long name that started with C.  I couldn't read it because she kept turning around. How this girl retains this job when she is so miserable to people, doesn't smile, doesn't say thank you - is beyond me. I let their head office know.  They care.  I was promptly emailed back and asked for more details.  I was told they want to fix the problem.  I suppose it takes a while to weed out bad employees.  I have no idea how long this girl worked there but, I am glad they plan on fixing the problem."}
{"text":"On the outside this might look like a trashy BK But I was impressed, they have great customer service and the bread on the burgers is always fresh. If you are looking for tacos they don't offer them at this BK -_-"}
{"text":"Straight up rude. Not the male workers but the female workers are so rude and so unpleasant to be \"helped\" by.. Sorry, but probably the worst BK experience I've experienced."}
{"text":"The manager, a blonde angry woman. Was screaming at the two people in the back over the head set about how she was going to fire them if she couldn't get three baskets of fries down.  She is the most unprofessional manager I have ever come across. She fired him over the intercom for the entire store to hear and when he threw his had on the ground and said it wasn't fair she called the police and tried to have him arrested. I feel sorry for the remaining employees.. What a miserable way to earn a living.. The dining room was packed and my order was completely wrong and made horribly so I just threw it away..  I drank my soda and went to steal and shake... This woman not only fired this man right before Christmas but is trying to have him arrested.. This woman is a first class Bitch...."}
{"text":"I've only been through the drive-thru and every freaking time they mess up my order and for the past two years they claim their Icee machine is broken.  I eventually got fed up by the lack of my son's favorite frozen beverage and consistently poor service that I wrote to the corporate office. That was a waste of time.  I guess broken equipment is acceptable and cheating customers out of food they pay for is okay."}
{"text":"As far as Burger Kings go, I've had much better.  Expensive (but that's normal for being in an airport), smaller menu (another airport ramification), and food wasn't as good as other BKs.  Service was fast and friendly, and there was plenty of seating."}
{"text":"BOOOOOOO!!!  So they went through all the trouble of installing electrical outlets at all the tables -- which is great for customers -- and then they cover them all up with outlet covers to block customers from using them.  Fantastic. I guess I won't be coming to this location again."}
{"text":"UPDATED: wow, no wonder your disgruntled employee walked in with a rifle last week threatening to shoot this place up. That sup/mgr is such a rude b*tch. Can't believe she talks to customers and employees like that.  NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through and got to the pay window only to have to place my order all over again. Nothing on the screen was right. Got the food home and still wasn't right. No work ethic these days. Double cheeseburger last time I knew had two patties. Nope neither one did. Called corporate they say they would forward to this store at Bullard and Cactus. Never heard anything."}
{"text":"This is a new burger king, and it shows. I ordered a double cheeseburger meal plain. Got a single burger. Brought it back they remade it with only one piece of cheese. Had the same problem at the one on Cactus and Bullard. I do the surveys usually not very good. The best one is at grand and Reems."}
{"text":"Took them 25 minutes to make a kids meal ready. There was only one customer ahead of me and the smell inside the store was awful, a guess they had burned the oil. On top of the the employee at the counter told me that he didn't want to be here.  No wonder why McDonald's is better by far. I'll never go back to this place"}
{"text":"Have been to this location on occasion, during my single escapade I have become very fond of the double cheeseburger, however at this location there seems to be an issue with the lettuce not being fresh, lines not be handled in the most efficient manner, and the staff being rude. Not sure what gives however I feel compelled to let the Northern Phoenix community know there are better places to \"have it your way.\""}
{"text":"One of the slowest Burger Kings ever. Sat in drive thru 3 minutes with only 2 cars in front of me. Never moved. Backed up and left. Was super ow lady time here when i went inside! Note to self... Don't go here if I've got a meeting to make."}
{"text":"I haven't been in since they've done the remodel, but my experiences here have been pretty average. Food was just like every other BK, the workers have generally been moderately helpful. The play area is great; my 3-year old loves it. I just went through the drive thru last night and got a brownie sundae. It was delicious, even though the brownie was hard- there was no way I could cut through it with my spoon. I ended up just picking the brownie up and chowing down. It's a good thing I was at home and not in public, because that was not an especially polite way to eat it."}
{"text":"The term \"fast food\" does not apply! Came in with my husband and 2 kids to get ice cream cones, there was 1 person in front of us and 1 person behind us and we waited over 15 minutes. For ice cream. With hardly anyone around. Seriously?"}
{"text":"Place is dirty, and I'm talking about behind the counter too. Looks like the employees don't know what they are doing! Horrible service and food was ok but took forever for a simple burger."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru for the husband once and he said he liked the way his Whopper was put together. Husband requested BK a few weeks later. We stopped in for a bite on our way back from the bank and decided to eat in. Ok, now I know places tend to get messy during rushes, but this place was FILTHY. When I say filthy, I mean FILTHY. The floor was sticky from the entrance all the way to the tables. It was as if someone mopped the floors with soda. The drink machine was covered in soda from top to bottom, trash on the tables from previous guests and the trashes were over flowing. There weren't any straws, ketchup or condiments of any sort in the dining room and there were flies buzzing around as if we were somewhere in the jungle. I thought about asking for a refund and eating elsewhere, but the kid that took our order was no where to be found and only came out after our number was being called. I will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"I had the 10 piece chicken nuggets and fries.  The nuggets taste like something I could do at home from Tyson. I had it with the sweet and sour sauce.  I didn't like the sauce too much but it did give the plain nuggets a bit of extra taste. I also had the fries and seems like they forgot to pour salt over it. I was starving and it still tasted bleh to me. I guess it is ok if you are lazy and don't want to take extra 36 steps down to Wendy's."}
{"text":"I try not to have high expectations for fast food joints, so I can only judge on the customer service experience and the price.  My cashier was rude and really made me feel like I was an idiot for requesting an ICEE instead of a fountain drink.  He kept saying, the fountain drink is included in the combo and I will have to charge you additionally for the the ICEE.   Sir, who cares? If I asked for an ICEE, give me my ICEE!! Why are you try to pinch my pennies??   In a state of confusion, I took the fountain drink cup and then realized that he really did NOT give me my ICEE! I went back to the counter to let him know that I still wanted my ICEE.  He said, \"Ma'am, I told you that was extra money, the fountain drink is already included.\"    Huh? Where is my ICEE?? Are you even going to ring it up?  In short, I ate my combo without an ICEE because my cashier refused to ring me up for it.  I guess, he just thought was would be a waste of my money to purchase an extra drink when one was already included.  Even for an airport, the prices are crazy.  You are looking at $10 for a combo meal.  Seriously?!?  I still want my ICEE!!!"}
{"text":"Waited in drive through for 10-15 mins just to get room temperature burgers and they didn't put extra things we asked and payed for the employee said idk what there doing in the back. \"Well maybe you should go back and find out\" is what I wanted to say. Worst Burger King I have ever been to....."}
{"text":"Worst service!!! Don't go here!! I've tried going here a few times when I'm in the need of something quick and convenient. I always get bad service, takes forever and the food isn't even worth the wait."}
{"text":"Just came to get an ice cream for my daughter while we waited for my car at one of the nearby dealerships. It was plain in flavour, even the chocolate syrup was watery and not very chocolatey tasting.   The texture of the ice cream was granular. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Burger King definitely ranks as one of the better fast food chains in the USA these days. This is the closest location to my house, and needless to say, the one I frequent the most.  I have never had any real problems with this particular location. They are usually very prompt, and take your order correctly. I don't recall any occasion in recent memory on which this particular location has messed up my order.   Burger King has a nice, diverse menu of items - chicken items, burgers (obviously), and even some other random, unexpected thing. This is one of the few fast food restaurants (if not the only one) that actually offers macaroni and cheese as a kids meal item!   At Major/Boulder, this is a convenient location for anyone who lives in the \"Old Henderson\" area.  If you like Burger King, I don't have any substantial complaints with this particular restaurant. The staff do a good job, and I haven't ever had any big problems worth reporting."}
{"text":"Love Burger King, though this particular location is far from my favorite. Still, I find myself frequenting this one since it is the closest one to my girlfriend's house.  This location usually takes your order and gives it to you promptly and accurately, but there have been a few times when the staff have been a bit absent-minded. On at least one occasion, I asked for onion rings in my meal instead of fries, and just ended up getting fries.   Another big complaint is that if you pay with a debit/credit card, they make you sign the receipt. This is the ONLY Burger King I know of that does this; I have been to at least a dozen other locations in the valley and none of them do this.  If you're in the neighborhood this place will probably take care of you well, just be sure to double-check your order."}
{"text":"i don't yelp but this burger king was terrible. EVERY machine was broke they had no straws??? i mean seriously what FAST FOOD doesn't have straws to drink out of. the only thing they had as far as drinks was coke. this place was ridiculous. terrible experience."}
{"text":"This is the closest Burger King to where I live and we go here because BK is the only fast food place around that has a veggie burger for my daughter.  The problem with this place is their drive-thru.  You gotta check carefully every time you get your food to make sure you get everything you ordered.  More than once, I've brought bags full of food home to find that one or more things either didn't get entered in right or weren't given to me right.  Some places are right on and always give me what I order first time, no repeats.  This is not one of those places.  Grumble."}
{"text":"My order was incorrect and then the young lady at the window acts disgusted with me. A little bit of courtesy goes a long way."}
{"text":"I came here 10 mins before 10pm on a weekday. I wanted to grab something quick to eat while I waited for my friend to drive by and pick me up. Needless to say, the staff had the doors LOCKED tight before 10pm even arrived. The only reason I came is because Yelp indicated they closed at 12 midnight, and who doesn't want a little fast food to kill the time, right? Anyways, all of a sudden the time on here has suddenly changed to 11pm.   I am so over it and will NEVER be coming here again! Employees that manage franchise locations need to pay attention to the hours posted on line. It is a waste of my time and everyone else to be misleading with store hours of operations!"}
{"text":"Just picked up lunch and this is my daughters chicken sandwich ?? The lettuce is BROWN and SOGGY and the chicken looks disgusting and broke up .... WTH?"}
{"text":"Service is sometimes slow but very quick the rest of the time; dining area is usually clean. The manager is always very friendly and helpful, and she demonstrates some of the best customer service I've seen in food service."}
{"text":"Ate here and got food poisoning I don't recommend eating here as they must not follow food health guidelines."}
{"text":"Anybody who writes a bad review on Burger King is a godamn idiot, it's Burger King bruh. It's not gonna be a damn Cheesecake Factory ! Why tf you guys writing reviews on a fast food restaurant ? You just showing me you poor af and you pissed your fries was cold cuz you spend your last 10 bucks on that meal and now you gotta wait till your next check come in to get another 2 things off the dollar menu, get your paper up and stop hating on Burger King it's actually delicious you assholes."}
{"text":"Solid example of fast food. Quick, friendly, clean and reasonable, IF you get an advertised special.  The sweet sour sauce for the nuggets is better than in many Chinese restaurants!"}
{"text":"Burger was squished and fries were not hot. I went through the drive through and didn't check my order until I had left. I will not go back to that location."}
{"text":"Food was great, the lady at the window was so rude and honestly acted like I was disturbing her. She clearly hated her job. I will not ever be back I actually said thank you and have a good day and she walked away. I asked her for more napkins for my kids trying to eat in the car and you would of thought I asked her to run a mile. Like I was holding up here line asking for a few more napkins!"}
{"text":"Stay away from the crappy McDonalds on Alta & Decatur and just come here..."}
{"text":"Female manager on staff as well as skinny teen who took my order were in the store at the time. I was inbetween jobs so I stopped in and got veggie burger meal. I was served right away, the food was just fine and so was service but Gurl let me tell you what I saw rolling out of the children's playground area...it was nasty...little kids barefoot scootin thru the resterant, there were 2 kids unsupervised, no parents around. Now if you are any type of smart parent you know better then to have your kids wonder thru a fast food joints nasty floors, if you don't then you were born in a barn raised by rejects with no social norms or skills...I am grading this place a 1 cus the front clerk nor the lazy manager said jack to the kiddie when the lazy mom drug herself from the children's cave of the resterant. Shame on employees not saying crap ...how's that next health Dept inspection Boo????"}
{"text":"Oh Burger King. How you did me wrong. It started out so promising. No line. Friendly. Quick service. But... then it happened. Hard, room temperature, chicken fries. Much to my dismay, my stomach continued to growl due to lack of food, as I couldn't eat them. I don't think I'll be returning to this location. Maybe the king is somewhere else....."}
{"text":"No motzerella cheese for italian chicken sandwiches? Come on! Order your product effectively for your specials."}
{"text":"The crispy chicken salad I ordered was ok. . The crispy chicken wasn't hot but the flavor and texture were good. I wouldn't order this salad again because there wasn't enough lettuce and tomato but a lot of bacon, which usually isn't a bad thing but more lettuce and tomato would have made it so much better. The honey balsamic dressing, I was dubious about and was pleasantly surprised at how good it went with the chicken. Very tasty! The server, Wendy, with her bubbly personality and all-around-helpfulness, was a welcome relief after a long night and day in an emergency room.  She's definitely a keeper !  The staff, in general, seemed interested in serving and had good attitudes. Also refreshing. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Shift manager was an asshole. I don't usually use profanity, but this defines him perfectly. His name is Dominic and I'm not sure if he was just having a bad day, but he should keep his problems outside work.   I tried paying with my debit card and unfortunately it was declined. I transferred the money, but the card still was declined (I'm unsure why). I wanted to apologize, but Dominic just slammed the window shut, clearly behaving with impatience and not being professional. I demanded he speak with me and he when he finally did, he basically whined about my card declining.   I work in the same type of industry and just like with any retail environment, sometimes cards get declined. It's already stressful enough trying to figure out why, so I don't need him to add to that. There is absolutely no reason to get upset at a customer when their card gets declined."}
{"text":"Had a childhood craving for a chicken sandwich... The old kind. Ordered through the drive through.  Sat at the quiet little ordering machine for 11 minutes exactly and I would've drove off except we were kinda stuck between a snow drift and the three cars now behind us. When they finally said \"how can I help you\", we ordered and then our total was given.  As we pulled up to the window to pay and get our food; we realized they gave us small everything ...fries, soda... What happened to having it MY WAY? payed and when we just about reached the capital, we looked in the bag only to find half our order missing. Darn it!!! It never fails ....if you're in a hurry enough tongi through BK drive through, you're not going t get what you ordered.  It's as if they know you're in a hurry, and won't come back.  Never again.  I'll fast for the day if I have to but I WONT go back to BK"}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking... Who leaves a review on a franchised fast food joint? This girl apparently.   If you happen to check in here and notice the reviews while waiting for your food, please double check to see if your order is right. There has been multiple times when a different burger from what I intentionally ordered ended up in my bag. And taste your soda! It might be flat.  Also, if you're mad about the situation and is the type of person to be proactive about it instead of complaining about it to the next person you encounter, call to speak with the manager since he/she will reimburse you for the same meal. The other reviews stand corrected on this specific location. I guess I was one of the unfortunates also. *face palm*  I'd still go back for their soft serve though."}
{"text":"My first visit inside. What a joke. My order was taken and then I received the wrong items. When I pointed that out to the kid behind the counter, who didn't seem to have a clue, he threw my order into a bag and pushed it toward me. The hash browns were just dumped into the bottom of the bag.  When I asked to speak to the manager, he told me he was the manager! Omg! It's better to go thru the drive thru so you don't have to deal with the staff at this Burger King.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I always come here and of course the food is as good as any other Burger King but there's some stuff about this place that kind of sucks :( :  - 3/10 times I'm here there's some smelly guy who's asking for change from people standing in line, and although the manager kicks him out he waits a while then just comes back in. - they no longer have the big ketchup dispensers, and if you want extra ketchup you're gonna have to bug the cashiers - the one time I used the washroom it was really dirty :( maybe that's more the people's fault than it is the burger kings...how can people be so nasty   if there was anywhere else I could get my whopper Wednesday's I definitely would go there :("}
{"text":"Like any other Burger King! I'd have to say that the service is a hit or miss...sometimes I feel like the manager is a little impatient or gives a bit of attitude. Not sure if I just take it the wrong way or if it's actually how it is.  Anyways. It's a clean place with cute tables and chairs which have the Burger King crown cut out on them."}
{"text":"There are few times when a meal is crafted so perfectly that you just have to to YELP! about it. THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE TIMES.   There was no customer service involved on my recent trip to this BK. I was given the greeting and then asked how I could be helped, a male attendant. To which I replied with my order. I then waited a minute for a response. No response. I asked if anybody was listening. Nothing for another minute. Then a female attendant asked for my order. I never got to confirm my order of two rodeo cheeseburgers and pie on the screen or given a total and was told that I'd get my total at the window. I pulled up to the window and again, no confirmation of my order. I gave my card as payment and received it back with no receipt, and was given my order. Upon inspection of my order it was wrong. Missing cheese on both rodeo cheeseburgers, a single napkin and no receipt.   I can get over not having cheese. It just comes down to asking your associates to spend the extra 10-15 seconds it may take to confirm the order for your customers the way other fast food chains have gone in order to give better customer service.   And give your customers the option to receive their receipt.   UPDATE 8/10/17 Decided I'd give them another shot at perfecting my $3 meal and they screwed the pooch again. This time I specifically verified TWO times with the girl working the drive thru that I wanted 2 Rodeo Cheeseburgers. She repeated my order back to me at the speaker box and I then verified that she heard me say Rodeo CHEESEburgers and she again verified before handing me my bag, this time with a receipt that said Rodeo Cheese Burgers on it. Gave them the benefit of the doubt and went back to my work. POOR DECISION! Again, NO CHEESE! Will not be returning to this location. Ill drive the extra 3 miles to go to the location at 35th and Thunderbird before I go to this location, which is within walking distance from my work."}
{"text":"I ask for my co worker to get me a burger and always no cheese since Im lactose and it was marked from my wrap no cheese amd when j opened why is there cheese? Never ever again will return at this place who can't read the food ticket smh"}
{"text":"Breakfast was poor at this newer location. Croissantwich was stale, bun was hard. Employee agrued with me versus just replacing it. No coffee, they had to make it, but it took 10 minutes. Employee said \"we have only one coffee maker and it is 30 years old\". Coffee was thick and gross. Service overall was slow. I can see why this Burger King was empty at 7:30-8:00 am. Go to another location."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  Employees are so grumpy!  We tried to go through the drive through to get our free satisfries. We were told we could only get one order per car do we had to park and go inside.  Kind of ridiculous.   Satisfries = meh."}
{"text":"The line was long tonight, but I had a friendly conversation with the lady at the first window and the man at the second window offered me a second free pie. Nothing to complain about, just thankful."}
{"text":"I love to eat at Burger king, but this location sucks, the line was so long and only one person taking orders and 3 others in the back. Please hire more people you are understaffed for a long time. ,Finally after 15 min another person appeared and it went fast. Took more than 20 min to get my food."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from Burger King and especially an airport Burger King. What minimum standards I have are based on good customer service and consistent food. It's like a branded hotel, where you know a Hampton is gonna be like any other Hampton. So what the heck am I talking about in regards to this Burger King? The cashier I dealt with last Friday needs to be fired. And in over 900 reviews so far, this is the first time I've said that. She literally (and TWICE mind you) talked back to me, made me feel like a liar, and was beyond rude.  All I did was order a veggie burger. When I saw she rang up a regular burger, I corrected her. She countered, \"No, you said Regular burger!!!!!\"  I stared and as she glared and yelled to cancel order number to the cook. Then when I paid, she repeated again that I didn't say a veggie burger. Seriously now. Then when I was waiting for the food, she could not stop glaring at me!!!!!! I was never rude. I just wanted what I ordered. I could also mention the fact that she refused to add extra mayo or leave off the ketchup. Seriously this all happened."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed.  They made at least 20 whoppers and just let them sit under the heater my burger was gross.  My husband doesn't like ketchup or mayo so his was fresh.     A group of women before me asked if they could have theirs fresh and the manager said it'd take 10 mins.  Did he try to shut down early?  Another guy behind me told him it was ridiculous what he was doing and stormed out after getting his money back.   The place is filthy.  The soda area smells like a washroom.  I didn't want to touch anything.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"22 minutes to get my order. Terrible service! I was the only one in the store when I placed my order although there were 3 cars in drivethru. Not acceptable! The only thing keeping this from getting a 1-star review is that (1) the restaurant was clean and newly remodeled, and (2) they did get the order accurate... again, after 22 minutes... not acceptable!"}
{"text":"Out of at least 30 drive-thru visits over the past year, I'd say 65% of the time, they mess-up my drive-they order, despite getting it right on the screen.  I'm sick & tired of it.  It's the most convenient BK location for me, and obviously if I'm hitting the drive-thru it is because I'm in somewhat of a hurry, so by the time I unwrap one of my burgers & start to eat it, I'm about to get on I-15 & no time to turn around & go back to complain.   Besides, at this point, if I did go back to complain, I'd create a scene by honestly calling them incompetent (due to the frequency they mess up my order).  Last week in the drive thru, I was at the window waiting for my food when the car that was in line ahead of me stopped & the woman got out & walked back to the window -- they messed her order up.  She apologized to me, and said that they usually do mess up her order, which is why she always pulls ahead a little then stops to check her food.  Yesterday, not only did they leave cheese off the burgers that I ordered & paid for cheese on (& confirmed that cheese was listed on the electronic display when I placed the order), but they didn't even include any napkins in the bag.  Usually they give me way too many napkins.  I was really fed-up that they screwed up my order again so I was going to call the store, however they didn't include a receipt (nor did they ask if I wanted one, so I assumed they'd put one on or in the bag.   This is yet another example of their $&%# inconsistency.  Usually when they mess up, it's not including cheese that I ordered & paid for, or I'll clearly say \"no tomato\" & they leave ketchup off instead, or there are still tomatoes on it.  These idiots want $15 an hour?!  Sure, at times they work hard, but they don't pay attention, and they get away with it because the manager(s) & owner(s) & corporate management seem complacent.  With them charging 25 cents for a slice of American cheese, I figure they owe me about $20 by now for all the times I paid for cheese, & they left it off.  I go to other BKs occasionally & occasionally have messed-up orders, but this BK in St Rose Parkway near Henderson airport is the worst by far & even though it'll be a big inconvenience, I'll start going to a different one."}
{"text":"Does $11 something for a Whopper with cheese, small fries, and a small Frozen Coke sound right to you?  Nor did it to me, and I spent (wasted) a couple minutes politely suggesting to the order-taker that the price couldn't be correct, repeating my order to ensure she got it right, etc. before I felt myself getting angry and decided that I needed to leave.    About 2:30PM on Thursday 15 June, I stopped by this Burger King, as I've done dozens of times before.   Despite being in a hurry, I decided that since two factors could complicate my order, I'd park & walk in, rather than hit the Drive-thru, though it's important to remember that I'd placed the exact same order there at their drive-thru DOZENS of times over the past couple years.    The place was pretty much empty -- just one other customer who was already sitting & eating his meal, and no customers at the counter.    My order-taker is a shorty, chubby white female, probably somewhere around her early 20s.  She had a lot of marks on at least one-arm, making me think she either recently had chicken-pox, used to 'cut' herself or put cigarettes out on her arm.    I had a coupon -- the one you that you get if your fill-out an on-line BK survey telling them how your last BK experience was.  It's ironic that I used to always give that BK high-marks, but it also reinforces to me how the negative incident was the purely the fault of the order taker.   The coupon gives you a free Whopper, *if* you buy a Whopper & at least a small drink & small order of fries.    Like I said, I've used that coupon for the same order many, many times before (I'd be embarrassed to admit how often I used to eat at BK...).  As a vegetarian, I usually get a Veggie Whopper (a regular Whopper, minus the meat -- not listed on the menu, but nonetheless a standard BK item that's not extremely rare) with cheese.  I'm always very polite to anyone & everyone who has*any* involvement with making my food, *and* because I know my order sounds a little complicated, I be sure to speak somewhat slowly & clearly (& I'm a native speaker of American English) to help the order taker get my order right...    So the first thing I do is hand her the coupon with the activation code completing the survey gives you on it, I give her time to read & comprehend the coupon, and then say \"Using this coupon, I would like to have a total of two veggie Whoppers, both with cheese, both minus tomatoes (giving her time to enter that into the computer before moving-on), and one order of small fries.  For the drink I also need to get in order to use this coupon, I'd like to get a small Frozen Coke.\"      The first sign that she couldn't comprehend things was when she asked me if I wanted both a small Coke & small frozen Coke, and I told her no, just one small, frozen Coke.        She still looks puzzled as she finishes with the order computer, and I know there's clearly a big problem when she says \"OK, that'll be $11 and ?? cents.\"     I look at her & say something like, \"You must have forgotten about that coupon for the free Whopper\" but she looks at her screen & then assures me that she didn't.    So now I repeat my order back to her, because clearly, there was some sort of miscommunication.   She sticks to that same price.  I tell her that I don't understand how the total can be so high, when one of the two Whoppers would be free (except for the cheese up-charge).   Without the coupon, & also without the drink, the usual price for two veggie Whoppers with cheese, minus tomatoes & a small order of fries is $6 something.    After 2 minutes of going back & forth with her, I decide it's futile to continue -- it's like we're in two different worlds.  My hunger & the insanity of the situation are starting to make me anxious & I decide it's in everyone's best interests if I just leave before I get angry.  I politely say \"You & I just aren't communicating, so I think I'll leave\" as I gently picked-up my coupon off the countertop.    As soon as I start walking away, back to my car, in a loud voice she says, apparently to workers in the kitchen area \"Did you hear that?  Did you hear that?!!  Can you believe it?!!\"      My first instinct was to turn around & run back to that counter, and even now, almost a week later as I think of the situation, I'm starting to get angry.   My rushing back to the counter would have resulted in some non-productive ugliness.    Instead, I am am posting this here, and will also make efforts to send all this to the franchise owner plus regional manager, in the hopes that she's either fired or undergoes major customer-service training.  I'm comforted again in the fact that I *know* from dozens of other times I've succesfuly placed the exact-same order there & at other BKs that the issue is solely with her, not me.  I ended up going to a different BK & placing the same order (minus drink) for $6 something, without even using the coupon!    I'll never return to that BK on Pecos Rd in Henderson."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Burger King that I've ever been to. It took them about 3 minutes to help me at the drive thru, I had to repeat my order multiple times because they kept getting it wrong, and to top it off, THEY GAVE ME MILK THAT EXPIRED 2 WEEKS AGO!!"}
{"text":"Like the rivalry between Coke and Pepsi there are pros and cons to choosing the number 1 or number 2 option. Number 1 will always be more consistent but once in a while number 2 will turn out a surprise.   McDonald's does the same as time wise in the drive through it seemed like it took ages to fulfill a 2 item order. They also put ranch into my not so-honey-mustarded chicken wrap.    However, I was quite  surprised ; this ain't the tasteless burger king I remember circa mid 2000's I haven't been to a burger king since they took away the angry tendercrisp and I was happy to have gone as the food was fried fresh and was much better then surrounding fast food in taste.   Then again they took a lot of time... DO I GIVE THEM  3 OR DO I GIVE EM 4  I went with the former"}
{"text":"They discriminate against people with disabilities. Never go here ever. The manager is very unprofessional. They need to get their act together. This is a business not a drama."}
{"text":"Good food but most the tables are really dirty. They need to be cleaned. Never seen a dirty table at Burger King so this is a let down for me."}
{"text":"This is my first and last time and this Burger King. I've waited 15 minutes at the drive thru to get my food while the cashier was texting the whole time.. worst service ever."}
{"text":"Now, don't think I haven't been anywhere. I have dined at elite restaurants as well as common places like this one. This location is very clean yet comes with a bit of a wait. The food is hot and fresh. The staff is very accommodating as well. They have not messed up my order."}
{"text":"Burger tasted like it had been zapped by a microwave. Fries were hard and over cooked. No problem with drive thru service. Just the food. Will not try again."}
{"text":"I am so grateful for the employees at this restaurant, especially Neal! Im from out of town and forgot my phone in the bathroom and they quickly got a hold of my emergency contact and reached out to let me know my phone was lost! Thank you for your honesty! Besides that it was a very clean restaurant with friendly employees! Again, thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Contents were COLD. My tots, my sandwiches.. terrible service and terrible food. By far the worst BK I've been to."}
{"text":"The service was super slow and bad. I have to charge extra money for refill on my drink. They even freakin closed early. I will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Man da fehlen einem die Worte. Unterirdisch ist noch fast zu Gut für den Laden. Geht da erst garnicht rein. nicht nur das Personal ist unhöflich, das essen ist kalt und der Laden ist Trecking. Man sollte kein Stern extra für Dolche Läden einführen."}
{"text":"Hands down best services just becuase its a fast food place doesnt mean they dont care. I have food allergies and the manger made them change there gloves to make sure i didnt get anything that im allergic to on my food. I wish more places would do this for us people with food allergies."}
{"text":"Third visit. Third problem. When I enunciate an order properly and it is repeated back to me properly... I expect it to be made to order correctly....MY WAY. This BK location has a problem with this philosophy. My largish order was half missing... and the half that was in the bag had 3 items that were not what I ordered. I worked in fast food at 14yrs of age...first thing I learned was expediting and how important putting out a correct product was."}
{"text":"Awful! Do yourself a favor and go down the street to McDonald's for a quick burger. Not only did they mess up our order twice, the food came out cold. Not just room temperature but actually cold. Never again."}
{"text":"At 9:00 am on a Wednesday had to tell the girl three times for a breakfast platter.  Three times for a simple breakfast platter.  Two cars in the line 14 minute wait. Did not say hello, thank you, how you doing, sorry about the wait nothing just hands me the bag. The breakfast sucked of course because it was ice cold and dried out.  Nice new building same crappy people."}
{"text":"Screw this place! I am so angry with them. I go through the drive thru and get greeted with \"what do you want?\" I wanted to leave right there but my boyfriend said no. Couldn't not take the order right, shake machine was down, got laughed at and heard someone call us fat! Wanted to try the angriest whopper and got a REGULAR WHOPPER!! Fries tasted like they were deep fried in spit! Didn't even get sauce for chicken fries, food taste so crappy. They don't deserve to be opened if you want burger King just go to columbus. And honestly if you have over 15 extremely bad reviews something needs to change!! Oh yeah, tried calling too to complain and line was busy. Nice right?"}
{"text":"On my way back from vegas, i thought of having a quick lunch at this burger king located within airport premises. I ordered a burger. First it around 20 minutes for them to serve it, ridiculously long for a fast food joint located at airport, with around 8 people staffsize, but to add to a misery, the burger served was with burned buns and yes!..the buns were charred black from inside!! Didnt get a chance to raise my concern with the outlet manager since i was running late to board my flight. But overall it was the worst possible burger experience i had till date. Would NOT recommend this place to anyone.."}
{"text":"Strictly comparing this to other burger places in the area, is highly rated by me. Considering I order special items and always have it my way they always get it right. I remember the first time they got my order wrong I called them right away and the lady I spoke to apologised instantly and profusely offering to make it right without doing what other places demand, like bring the food back. It's inconvenient and inconceivable to be expected to leave work and return from your break.   As for fish sandwiches everyone else offers a seasonal delight but that's it. Burger king has actually improved their fish sandwich into a long submarine like style that is phenomenal compared to the others.   For those that know my diet they offer a veggie burger and it has mayonnaise so I always order that without, otherwise it's perfect.   Obviously the fries are better than McDonald's."}
{"text":"They always forget my zesty sauce. I actually get legitimately upset because I look forward to it. This time I went all the way home before realizing.. I'm super bummed right now"}
{"text":"0 start. The place is dirty, filthy, full of garbages. The manager doesn't seems to care, or actually he does care about the pictures I am taking. The cashier couldn't take our order until the person in the kitchen was back from the \"toilet\"!!!!!  Oh well I guess this is Burger King's way to care for their customers."}
{"text":"It's Burger King with typical Burger King food. The staff is nice, but the building is in great need of repair."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location roughly 4-5 times in the past two years simply because they ALWAYS get orders wrong, the food is cold, or the customer service is completely horrible. Tonight I went with my sister to get some late night cravings and were very disappointed in the 'manager' on duty because she not only was texting in clear view rather than helping with the 3-4 cars behind us, but she went to the point of even leaning over to start texting. All we ordered was a small fry, 2 medium milkshakes, & a package of cookies. All which took well over 5 minutes to even get. Secondly, the 'manager' kept touching her clothes, face, the window seal, and her cell phone and assumed we'd still want our food. That's nasty and unsanitary. We were nice enough to just say we saw her texting even though there was more to the decision of wanting a refund for the food she specifically touched. Regardless of telling her we didn't want anything besides the milkshakes she still went to the back and handed the nice young lady with red hair (sorry don't remember her name) a bag of cookies and told her we didn't want them because we saw her texting. No sweetie, you kept touching your clothes, your face, your dirty phone, and the dirty window seal. I understand she is pregnant and may need to lean over sometimes, that's fine...just wash your hands if it's touching unsanitary locations. I can say the customer service has come a long way since the very first time of ever coming to this location...it's not perfect but definitely getting a little better. On the other hand the preparation of your food, the quality (hot when suppose to be hot and cold when needs to be cold) still has a long way to go and the sanitation of the employees as well. I don't expect fast food to be anywhere near perfect, but at least TRY! Seriously need to consider having mystery shops during the evening / night to see what really goes on in the business."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and they never get the order right. Missing food and then if you have to go back and get the food they don't do the typical fast food apology with a free side to make up for the error and inconvenience."}
{"text":"Hello friends,   This BK isn't the cleanest nor the fastest but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"Hello friends,  If slow & dirty was the goal to reach 1 star.  Well, they got that covered.  Find another location."}
{"text":"Garbage. I showed up at 9:45pm at the driver thru. Apparently they close at 10:00 according to their door hours and at 12:00 on the website. Anyways, all the lights were on and only one lane was coned off. The employees proceeded to ignore me despite my asking if they were open and, eventually honking to try and at least get some reply. My efforts were in vain. I called the store itself and asked if they were open and was told no. I would definitely recommend dining somewhere where the employees at least try to give a shit."}
{"text":"830 pm and not a car in the drive thru. I am craving a whopper so I whip into the drive thru. Order a #7 its late so I go with the whopper jr. As I salivate the whole way home nibbling on the fresh fries which tasted great, I am ready for the whopper! Open the wrapper and there is some sort of round chicken sandwich. How can nobody be in line and you screw up the 1 order you have. Keep smoking and listening to Khalid..young dumb broke high school kids."}
{"text":"I know it has been awhile since I patroned one, but I couldn't believe how expensive this BK was. We ordered two of the cheaper meals, no frills, and it was over $15.  Aside from the price, it took forever for someone to take our order even though we were the only customers in line.  The food came fairly fast and it was decent, but the prices alone will keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a go-to for me on days I can't get out of work on time to go home for lunch. The 2 stars are for the insta-shits I got after eating a mostly mediocre whopper with cheese today. In all seriousness, beware. It was no bueno."}
{"text":"Ordered five French toast sticks, got 2.5. Thanks for stealing my money scum bags."}
{"text":"Keep your receipts, this location makes repetitive mistakes and they will not replace or credit your order if you don't have a receipt. Management tries to be nice, but they nickel and dime you when they make the mistake. Keep receipts and make notes of the manager you talk to when they screw up your order because they will mess your order up.   Once against service sucks. More interested in drive thru than eat in customers. New manager needed at this location badly."}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru for over 5 minutes however the line never moved, so we went inside to order. Inside the manager was standing speaking to two workers and informed them to ignore the customers inside and only focus on the drive thru, I informed the manager I was in the drive thru waiting, her response was \"don't like it then leave\". So that's exactly what we did and we will never go back."}
{"text":"Catching up on reviews...Nothing good to say about this Burger King. I don't even think they deserve one star.  Always bad service, always slow service, always cold food, coke machine is always out of everything except coke and diet coke. Always needs tables cleaned. I've tried several times not going back for awhile. Always the same when you come back. I will never come to this location again. They need new management and just an over haul of the whole business."}
{"text":"Okay i don't normally rate a 1 star... but this location got me pissed.. literally waited over 20 min in the drive thru because the lady at the last window couldn't  figure out our order?!! Like Really??!!  By the time we got our food it was already cold and she even offered to make us a free shake or ice cream... (and apologized)  Like No! Im hungry and just give me my food so i can go! And to top it off. Its a new location and the line at the drive thru was long already! ?   Dear management: get your staff trained right!    Just because its a new location doesn't give an excuse to figure out an order especially when its numbered! Wow"}
{"text":"On Memorial  Day of 2014 around 3:30 pm before going to a baseball game we stopped to get something to eat (cheaper), upon walking into Burger King there was a homeless man sitting in a booth that kept passing out and waking up. The manager or shift leader did nothing. Setting aside that the manager or shift leader could not understand what I was requesting for a meal, there was something bigger. Now I am one not to give into things easily. I felt a strong feeling to buy this man a $1 hamburger. When I walked up to the counter, she looked at me with discussed as if I was ordering more food. I looked at her and said not it is not for me, on my own I would like to buy the man in the lobby a $1 hamburger. Again she looked at me with discussed, lip curled up and said no. I asked you so you are saying that I cannot buy this man food, something no one asked me to do that I am dong on my own free will. She still said no. She did not have a problem with him trying to talk to me and my friend while we were eating or that he had a really bad order. But has a problem with someone buying someone food when they are hungry. Shame on you, God moved me to feed someone and you stopped that from happening. SHAME SHAME! Will not ever go back! P.S. I forgive you, I just hope that the hungry man can do the same."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service, especially at the drive thru. The server: Roshay, was not friendly at all, has no sense of courtesy (no smiles or thank you's) and does not seem like she is enjoying her job. Along with her negative tone, I asked for ranch and napkins but she immediately closed the window and acted like she didn't hear me when I knew my voice was loud enough for her to hear. When I did get her attention 20 secs later to ask for ranch and napkins, in a very bad tone, Roshay explained and charged me an extra $0.27 cents. Because it's lunch time and I was very hungry, I took out my credit card, and paid $0.27 for one piece of ranch. This is the very very first time I've been charged for ranch and this is the very very first time I've gone through a drive thru without the server saying anything before I pressed the gas pedal, just silence. Very negative vibe. I understand that it may be very busy during lunch, but getting a negative vibe before eating should not happen to anyone, it makes the food taste bad and you lose most of your appetite."}
{"text":"I've ordered food from this location once too many times for the simple fact that is the one closest to my home. Unfortunately, is NEVER a good experience! Every single time there's a food item missing! Or we order thru the drive thru and they make us wait in front of the business which defeats the whole purpose of going thru the drive thru in the first place. I'm done with this location!! Moving forward i will make that extra drive to the Simmons and Ann location, to get the overall great service and experience they know to provide!"}
{"text":"This is the best Burger King location I've been to.  The service was very friendly and the food was great, especially the chicken fries.  I recommend this location to anyone who's a Burger King fan."}
{"text":"Make sure when you order you specify as a small or medium. If you say \"regular\" meaning the price listed on the board, they charge you for a medium. Also, double-check for straws.  Hope my lunch tastes better than the service."}
{"text":"We Went drive-thru and got 3 chicken sandwich, Big Fish sandwich and nuggets.  Everything was BURNT! Fish was hard as rock. All burgers looked like it's been sitting in the warmer. Everything Hard, Dry and burned! I hate this place."}
{"text":"Great service went in there for lunch and they were friendly and fast. The only thing I have to say bad about it, the restrooms were a little dirty but besides that great place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Burger King is sooooooo long until I went with my friend the other day.  He talked me into it.  I shouldn't have let him.  I got the \"veggie\" burger and it was gross.  They slathered it in some sort of mayo-ish concoction and it wasn't good at all.  Plus you know they cook it right next to all the meat, so it's probably not really a veggie burger at all.  Good thing I'm not a hardcore vegetarian or I would have freaked out!  My friend liked his hamburger, but I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time last weekend. Place is filthy...looked past the dirty tables to see a cockroach half way through my meal. Never gain will we eat this this disgusting place. All the staff could say was they were sorry and they recently had taken over the building and knew there had been this issue with the previous tenants. Nope, that place has been open for years. If I could upload pics/video I would."}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest \"fast\" food restaurant. Every time I have a craving for a whopper I soon remember why I never go there.  It smells going through the drive thru like sewage most of the time and it takes forever to get your food.  Most of the time I get the line \"waiting on fries.\"  The service is seriously terrible.  You could order, go to Safeway, buy the ingredients and make a whopper yourself by the time they have your order ready."}
{"text":"Filthy dirty, garbage cans over flowing. Floors are black with dirt tacles and chairs with left foid and crumbs. I walked in and walked out."}
{"text":"The snowbirds are back to the Sun Lakes area in force and the inept and overwhelmed staff at this Burger King couldn't handle it.  Not that they were that busy but these guys needed about 20 minutes per order and were only hitting accuracy at about 40% or so.  I haven't been to a BK in a long time so my FFF radar was down (Fast Food Fubar).  A buy one get one coupon lured us in.  I actually felt bad for one guy that seemed to be in charge.  My daughter and I stood back and watched the carnage for the first fifteen minutes waiting for our order.  Then we received our sandwiches that were not the right sandwiches.  Then we returned them and waited some more.  Then we just got a refund and left.  But during that time we watched the cashier wander around and attempt to help in a hesitant fashion as if she had never been behind the counter before.  The one guy in the kitchen seemed overwhelmed, easily confused and uncertain what the difference was between say bacon, sausage and eggs.  And the guy I felt bad for kept flitting from the drive up \"Oh my God that guy has been waiting 14 minutes!\" to the kitchen \"No, this goes here.  We're out of biscuits!  Totally!\" to bagging orders \"Sir, you still haven't gotten your food?  Really?\""}
{"text":"My basis for fast food reviews:  Every restaurant starts at 3 stars since, theoretically, they should be the same whichever location you go to.  Plus or minus stars for cleanliness, speed of service, and the quality of the food I'm eating that day.  Usually will order something new to the menu.  Reviews are only in comparison to other locations of the same chain.  More like 2.5 stars.  Went drive through and ordered two new menu item:  the classic hot dog and the Whopperitto.  Speed of service and everything non-food related was business as usual.  The hot dog was fine.  It's pretty big.  It's really nothing too much more than your average Ballpark frank.    The Whopperitto is a no.  Basically just everything in a Whopper rolled into a tortilla with a slightly spicy sauce.  The tortilla itself is flavorless, and the contents were totally overpowered by the pickles.  I didn't mind the texture with everything being in there, but it was all just pretty sloppy and salty.    So minus half a point for the Whopperitto, otherwise, just your run of the mill location."}
{"text":"Great fast service for someone leaving on a flight. Doing my mileage run for A-list status on Southwest. Didn't charge for sauces which I appreciated. I love the dining area how big and how much seating it has. Also you don't have to pay for refills. Really nice."}
{"text":"Okay for a quick meal. this place has a kid zone which keeps the noise down in the main restaurant...brilliant !"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and FYI every single time I go there none of my cards ( all of them work perfectly everywhere else ) \" read\" on their crappy machines SO inconvenient and incompetent.  Get machines that work and people who know how to use them.  Frankly any idiot can. And than they blame my card because it has scratches when it's brand new --what a joke and this has happened at multiple locations and nowhere else so it's their crappy machines for sure: zero compassion either like really were you not going to give me my $4 order for the kids in my car if my card didn't work? Losers ."}
{"text":"its burger king, but this location is much nicer then the one right next to my house."}
{"text":"Qué se puede decir de una de éstas hamburgueserías?... La comida ya la conocen todos, lo único que puede cambiar entre un local y otro, es la ubicación. Al estar sobre Av.Maipú, hay mucha tránsito de gente, lo bueno es que tiene una terraza que da a la avenida, ideal para aprovechar el solcito mientras comés. El local es bastante limpio y tiene buena atención."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Burger King in town. The service is fairly average, but the food is far below average. As soon as I got home and ate my food, it tasted stale and cold."}
{"text":"Been going here for more than 3 years, near my work.  Consistent, good service, clean and friendly.  Never had a wrong order and has always been fast.  Fast food though, so the 3 is for the food, i would give 5 for the service."}
{"text":"I know that life in the fast food chain should be.... faster....but please if you give the order and one order is missing.....it's not good. Try to be accurate because driving back and complain is a waste of gas even if the store would refund. Damage control doesn't work here."}
{"text":"Pull up to the drive-through for egg and cheese croissant this is what I get cold croissant non-melted cheese change fell on the ground in the drive-through for customer service"}
{"text":"Carl and I decided to try Burger King.  Exceptional service from the staff tonight. Also, a friendly patron helped me get our drinks and bring them to the table seeing that I am handicapped and having problems. So thankful for their help. The food was good, too."}
{"text":"Extremely expensive, even considering it is airport food. Quality also seems much lower than your neighborhood BK, & service was SLOW. I waited around 10 minutes for 1 veggie burger (which was dollars more than it normally is). Then, I had to get back in line to let the one worker know they had gotten my order wrong. As a vegetarian, my options for food were limited here during a delayed flight wait, & unfortunately this was the only source of veggie protein I could find."}
{"text":"This Burger King is on my way home from work. It's a convenient location.   This restaurant went through a recent renovation. I have yet to dine in here. I typically go through the drive-thru, often to get a snack or a drink because I'm thirsty.   Service is fast. The food is what you'd expect from Burger King.   You can get decent deals. Right now, you can get two original chicken sandwiches for $5. The downside of the original chicken sandwich is that it is so full of sodium that I instantly feel like I'm retaining water.   I like the occasional promotion of 10 chicken nuggets for $2. Again, I like snacking here.   You can pay by debit or cash. I have yet to try using a credit card.   There is plenty of parking here.

{"text":"I used to hang out around this area a ton a few years ago. Michael-Angelo's, a grocery store, was next door to Burger King. I would shop there, get my Portuguese egg tarts, and then grab a quick bite to eat at Burger King.  Since Michael-Angelo's moved from Markham to Aurora, and then got bought out and is no longer with us, I haven't visited this area. I decided to give Burger King another shot again.  In the past, I remember having a Whopper combo coupon. I ordered at the drive-thru speaker, and then presented my coupon at the window. I got chewed out by the woman for not saying that I had a coupon at the speaker. Wow, sorry. I thought that I could tell you when I am paying, so you can make the price adjustment.  The other day, I came after work and used the drive-thru. I had a coupon for a Whopper combo for $5.99 before taxes. I placed the order and indicated that I had a coupon. The man was polite and nice. Hey, I should come back here more often!  I paid. He was so kind. It was quite a different experience for me.  My food was decent. It hit the spot. My Whopper was yummy. The fries were okay, but I did eat them all (I'm not a huge fries person, but like them from time to time). I washed everything down with a Diet Coke.  I normally go to the Burger King closest to my work. I should stop here more often.  (218)"}
{"text":"Tried their \"new\" crispy chicken sandwich. Took 2 bites and threw it away. Has same breading taste as their original, however, the consistency was like a sponge! Terrible! Told whoever was behind counter and all he said was sorry about that. Did not offer a refund. Will not return."}
{"text":"No wonder you are only 1 star, I went thru drivethru , all I ordered was a fish sandwich, left n got on highway only to discover it was not even lukewarm, YUCk... please please don't serve cold fish to anyone, oh and by the way did I mention my spouse is a lawyer."}
{"text":"Understaffed, disorganized, long waits for your food, and the dining room was filthy, not a clean table in sight to eat at for lunch."}
{"text":"Every single time I come here no matter what time of day it is, when I go through the drive through I get told to park out front and wait for my food. I end up sitting there and waiting for around 10mins. What's the point of a drive through if it's faster to go through the lobby even at 10pm. And my order is wrong or they don't have the item I am asking for.  25 min wait time for a kids meal!!!!! What a joke And they forgot my cookies so I had to go back again rofl"}
{"text":"The interior design appears to be done by a blind person from the 80s. The store was clean however and the nice big bright screens in which the food items were displayed was a plus. The angry whopper I ordered had this disgusting sauce on it and the whopper my friend ordered made her sick. She couldn't even finish half of it. This Bk gets bonus points for the coke 360 machine or whatever it is called, but all the drinks we tried seemed off. Their fries were also a better than I remember, but that isn't saving much. With chick-fil-a, McDonald's, and Chipotle so close. Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"The combos were over priced as in are we in a foreign country which devalues the American Dollar? Oh no, we are in Vegas, and an airport nonetheless. The fries were fresh but tasteless cafeteria style and the dining areas were filthy.Burger was pretty standard."}
{"text":"Best Burger King in the valley 99 percent of the time they are spot on.   Last night forgot my wallet and I was three dollars short for my dt order I asked for them to take off the onion rings and they did but they still gave me the onion rings awesome job"}
{"text":"Pull everyone forward in the drive through and make them wait on their food.  Sitting here with three cats right now and non other vehicles in the drive thru.  I'm guessing to keep their stats up? Or avoid people passing by when they see a long line.  They have no business in the store leaving me to wonder what takes so long for them to fill orders.  Poorly run."}
{"text":"I think just about every time I have been here, they have screwed up my order, and every time they screw it up, they are missing something, this time they were missing a patty in my double whopper. I am beginning to think they do this on purpose!  Never use the drivethru for this reason!"}
{"text":"If it weren't for my most recent experience, I wouldn't write a review for this place.  So my family and I went through the drive-thru for what are \"normal\" items in the menu - whoppers, classic chicken sandwiches and chicken nuggets.  The three cars ahead of me went quickly only for me to realize that they were asked to park in the parking lot and wait.  Our wait was long enough that I had to bring my daughter in to use the bathroom.  Then when an employee finally brought our food out, they didn't take note of who out the order in and he had to walk to several other cars.  Customer service lacking.  If you ask patrons to wait, at least know who ordered what.  Then the order was wrong - wrong chicken sandwich and only one of two.  Nugget sauce was wrong.  Whoppers were sad looking.  I would have brought everything in and asked for money back if we weren't half way home and it was already late (in terms of my daughter's bed time).   We have been here before and it has been a little off the mark.  It's taken longer than \"normal\" fast food.  I've had to \"pull up\" before recently.  Orders had to be corrected.   I need to find another Burger King closer to our location.  It's just horrible that this BK is along the way to most of our activities.  I guess I'll visit PDQ and McDonalds more often."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with the family as the little one wanted burgers. Ordered two Mushroom Swiss Bacon Whopper combos and a kids cheeseburger meal.   The kids cheeseburger meal was normal. But our two MSB Whoppers were bad. After I ordered I saw the guy at the back scrapping the bottom of a plastic container with a long spoon. The contents of which he put onto two burgers, my burgers. Anyways took the food to the table to eat.   Opened the first burger and it was watery. Looked inside and the bacon was tiny little cut strips made for a baby burger. Then the source of the liquid... little shredded remains of what was once mushrooms. Same on the other burger.   Went to the counter to ask for more mushrooms as ours looked like a hamster took a poop in it. The manager asks to see the burgers. I took them back to the counter, she opens them both and manhandles them. Literally like tossing around road kill. I asked her kindly \"Please don't do that, we still have to eat them\". She tells me they are ok, Burger King puts one scoop of mushroom in each burger. I said HA! Impossible! I told her what I saw earlier with the guy scrapping the container. I asked again for more of something that looked like mushrooms and we'll garnish it ourselves.   The manager goes to the back in search of mushrooms. Finds the empty container, the guy shrugs at her. She goes further back and comes out with what looks like a plastic bag filled with a stool sample. Throws it into a special Burger King machine, possibly a microwave. She comes back to the counter and tells me it will be 5 minutes before the mushrooms ready.  I took my molested burgers back the the family and told them to just eat slowly as we're waiting on more mushrooms. Five minutes pass and the cashier brings us a cup with enough mushrooms that you would think it's a side dish.  I taste the mushrooms and realize canned food really isn't all that bad. Bagged Burger King mushrooms is bad. Not wanting to waste the food nor the effort to get it, we pile on the mushrooms into our MSB Whoppers.   Suffice to say, we're not going back."}
{"text":"Have been waiting for 20 minutes in the drive thru normally I would just leave but the lane doesn't have anywhere for me to go and so I'm stuck having to wait. Worst wait time I have ever had. And there's still 2 cars ahead of me. What is wrong with this place.  Update  just got to the window finally after 35 minutes waiting to find out they don't even have my order and she kept asking me what I ordered so I left and don't go here"}
{"text":"I didn't actually eat here... I was lured to the drive through by the heat outside and the giant .50 cent ice cream cone signs.  .56 cents later I parked in the shade and tried to extract flavor out of the cold swirl in my hand... didn't work.  What my favorite part about this whole deal was this- as I was sitting there a gal who works there (I could tell from the uniform she had on) pulls up into the spot next to me for her shift. She didn't see me sitting there as I imagined the flavor of vanilla or Tahiti. What struck me about this gal was that she spent about 6 minutes primping herself in her rear view mirror to go into work.  I liked the fact that even though it was Burger King in Happy Valley, AZ this gal wanted to make sure she looked good for her customers.  That's all. Now go home."}
{"text":"I normally do not eat fast food, but desperate times call for desperate measures.  I got my whopper with cheese and fries and took it back to my terminal.  The food was fast and hot when I got it.  Tasted pretty good going down, but then again I was starving!  Within 5 minutes of consumption I remembered why I don't eat fast food.  It had nothing to do with this location, fast food just hurts my tum tum.    Also have to mention that it was the only place open in the middle of the week at 8pm."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. I just went to the drive thru and got cut in line. And when I tried to confront the employee about it he just ignored me and told me to order. Place is trash don't go there."}
{"text":"I would probably give it about 2.5 stars, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.  I've been here numerous times over the years, and the entire experience - from food quality to customer service - is hit and miss. Some times I've gone here to find an empty lobby, perky employee, and quick service - while other occasions I've experienced slow service, sloppy food, or iffy employee attitudes.  The neighborhood along Boulder Highway can be sketchy in some patches, and that is reflected by some of the patrons I've seen here.   It's the closest Burger King to me, so it's where I go if I have a hankering for one of their chicken sandwiches, or if my kids want some cheap chicken nuggets.   If your expectations aren't too high, you'll probably find it to be an acceptable location."}
{"text":"Place is disgusting! More homeless people hanging out asking for change the the street corner! Sat down to enjoy my meal and three minutes into it I get asked for change by some nasty stank hobo!"}
{"text":"There was no flavor to my food!  How in the world can you mess up a BK original chicken sandwich or FF?  Temperature was fine but I've eaten a lot if those and never been tasteless.  For $7.33, I expect edible.  Never return to this one!"}
{"text":"this location has higher prices than any location i have been ! althought t.v advertises $1.00 menu....this location charges their own higher prices....  their reasoning is....hard to find employees?    i was there a couple weeks ago and got a simple ice cream cone and the man did not bother to hold the cone on the wrapper, but instead held the actual cone....i do not know this mans sanitary habits but i just couldnt get myself to eat the cone......thats what the paper wraps are for!!  i am often in this area and very seldom to i stop here....only when the other places have a long line do i come here, knowing there is never a line....because there are not a whole lot of customers!   there is a mcdonald up the street that has $1.00 drinks and a $1.00 menu...that is actually a dollar....  this is a lower income area , therefore one would think prices  would be more affordable than say...scottsdale!  wrong!  bon appetite!   it'll cost ya"}

{"text":"I don't want to waste too much time on this place, but since I mentioned it in another review I feel obligated to say a few words.  This is the worst Burger King in the world so far, and I have been to some bad ones. Everything manages to have a bitter taste that I just cannot explain. I seem to remember a time when BK did not nuke every single thing, but those days are a fading memory. Bitter taste plus microwaved texture equals food that hogs would turn up a nose at. Still the place is usually crowded.   The one redeeming quality is the staff. I've worked a block away for two and a half years and a lot of the crew have worked there that whole time. They're pretty friendly considering what they get paid. Still, the food is just so terrible I cannot bring myself to give it even two stars."}
{"text":"I do like burger king but I will never go to this one again. The lady in the drive thru taking my order had a terrible attitude. I told her that I had a coupon and when I came to the window she literally crinkled it up and threw it aside. I heard her tell one of the coworkers she was so irritated. Then I asked for ranch and she said they were all out. I ordered a Sprite and she gave me a fry and always charged me a couple extra dollars than the total should've been. I went in for a Sprite and gave back the fry, I showed the manager my receipt and they said it was that much because of tax... $4 in tax for less than $5 of food?"}
{"text":"Make sure your coffee lid is on tight... I ordered a coffee, just a coffee. One coffee... it's not like I had a big order or anything, just one cup of coffee. Took a sip and the lid wasn't on all the way so half of it leaked out and spilled all over and burned my lap and stomach. They had one job and couldn't even prepare a cup of coffee safely. Thanks Jackie."}
{"text":"Burger King is my kryptonite. I can avoid all other fast foods but this place is always hard to turn down. I love the food here. FLAME BROILED. Yum. I don't eat much fast food. Not that it is beneath me or anything but because it always gives me a really bad stomach ache when I do.   But not Burger King. I have always been able to eat here with no problems at all. So that is what keeps me coming back. Honestly, a nice Whopper Jr, or even the full Whopper Sr. ( my own name for it). Their fries are thick and crispy and not overly salty, and the Oreo milkshakes. Seriously guys! It cannot get any better.  This location is far enough away from me that I do not make a habit of coming here. But sometimes when coming back from a shopping trip at the Mills it is just too easy to come here. The staff is courteous and pleasant and always put up with me being like, way to excited than I should be for fast food. They answer questions that we have about the menu, I mean, tell me more about these hot spicy chicken tenders, and put up with my taking forever to order even though I know what I am going to get each time.   This place is my downfall, but if I am going down, I am doing it with some crispy fries and a nice Whopper Jr."}
{"text":"Closed the door on me right at they were closing, the women told me to go around to the drive thru and when I got there they told me \"I need to have a car\". Like...what the hell man.  So I got a cab and went through the drive thru and gave them crap for not letting me in. Cost me $8 for the cab and $11 for food. All that cause you lied to me, I'll never visit this place again."}
{"text":"I don't leave a lot of bad review but when a place has to be horrible 2 out of 2 times then it's time for a bad review.  I came here once about a year ago and the food was ok and the service was horrible.    Today I come and I try the drive thru.  They ya e a double drive thru.  One had a vehicle and the person was placing a order I went to the open spot.  I sat there easily 5 minutes and then I backed up and tried again. I finally decided to go to the other spot and I then sat there for another couple minutes.  Finally a guy comes and I can't here him and he can't here me so I finally just backed up and left.    I guess these service issues explain why this location had no customer except the 1 ahead of me (who some how got service).    NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"I can't believe it, I just paid almost $15 for a whopper meal? Really come on man, this isn't right. BK or the airport are making tons of money on this spot. Probably would never buy anything at the airport from now on. BK ripped off...."}
{"text":"Just opened in downtown Pittsburgh. As expected, hoards of people lined up during lunchtime.  Got the 2 for $5 deal where I chose the Big Fish Sandwich and Extra Long Cheeseburger.  Sandwiches were nothing to write home about but a different taste from McD's and Arby's.  Even with a somewhat organized manner where one person where shouting out orders and passing the brown bags, it took an extraordinarily long time before you got your food (20 mins for mine).  Of course, by the time you actually are able to eat it, it's cold (no tables to eat with small dining area and most of the space are filled with people waiting for their orders).  My colleagues waited for 25 minutes while everyone else got their order.  Finally, they went up to inquire about it and the employees realized those orders got \"lost in the mix\".  Wow, 30 minutes to get your lunch.  I am sure it will get better in time here but the initial layout and planning of space did not allow adequate  room to accommodate the lunch rush anticipated.  Probably would have been a good idea to utilize the second floor for dining like the former establishment."}
{"text":"8:30pm walked in. The girl mopping the floor ignored me. The rest of the crew was oblivious that someone was at the cash register. Yelled out anybody taking orders? Someone named Sharon came out and greeted me with they are out of hamburgers and whoppers. Easily the worst Burger King I ever been to. Should not be in business. Ended up going to the one on Cheyenne near Durango."}
{"text":"Maybe some of my surprise came from not having been to any new Burger Kings of late, but I was really surprised when my husband and I went in to this location yesterday morning (we had a craving for fast food breakfast) and saw that it was all decked out in a Hollywood theme. It had sleek colored booths, framed pictures of movie stars, and get this - pendant lighting! Granted, pendant lighting has become as ubiquitous in restaurants as jukeboxes used to be, but it's still strange that fast food franchises have even jumped on the decor bandwagon. Anyway, the people working at this location are super-friendly, although the staff does tend to be more motivated when a location is relatively new (this one is about a year old), and the food we got was to be expected. I do love BK's French Toast Sticks for a nutrition-less but delicious Saturday morning breakfast, and my husband's sausage muffin was good (although he ordered it with egg and cheese and didn't get them). To sum it up, this is a good location as far as Burger Kings go, but in the end, it's just Burger King, which is never really all that great."}
{"text":"This place has horrible Customer Service. They shorted us some food on our order in the drive thru. I called them to let them know that they left some of our food off the order and they swear up and down that they did not forget anything in the order. I told them that I am holding my order and there is food missing and they did nothing to rectify the situation. I will NEVER go to this location ever again."}
{"text":"They don't accept BK mobile app coupons. Both food and service are subpar for a BK and prices are about twive of a regular BK."}

I went through the drive thru... apparently there was a conversation going on and then he asked what my order was ...I ordered a whopper Jr combo with iced coffee ... he said do you want cheese I said no thank you ... he asked what flavored iced coffee I replied mocha ... at the window I received a watery chocolate milk ish drink it was awful ... i handed it immediately back to the girl at the window it was that disgusting ....then got my food .... in my bag I had a bun with lettuce tomato onion pickle but no burger... mediocre fries .... called Corp. .. they offered a whopper ... it was such a bad experience I declined ... no more whoppers for me ... and I would hate for anyone else to have to experience this... don't waste your $$$"}
{"text":"I just visited this BK about half an hour ago and we had a bad experience. First we ordered our food in the drive thru and when we pulled up the girl told us the total was $35 for 1 Bacon and Cheese Whopper, medium fries, Whopper Jr, and a shake. So we questioned her abt it being so much and she said she had entered 4 whoppers so she gave us our correct total. Then she gave us a Sprite and we told her that we didnt order that we ordered Medium fries. So she said she would change it since it was the same price. Then after waiting she told us to pull up front. We waited 5 mins and my husband got off and went inside to see what was taking so long. He came out to the cae confused and one of the employees came out to give food to other people who where waiting for their food as well but they got there after us. So I got down and went inside and the manager asked me what I was waiting for. I told her we had been waiting outside for our food and no one had brought it to us. So she gave me a \"free\"  chicken sandwich and gave me a whopper, fries, and the whopper Jr. I just got the food and left mad as we had been waiting for a while. Well when I got home they didnt not give me the hamburger as I had ordered it it didnt  bacon and my husbands whopper Jr didnt have what he ordered as extra. This was horrible service from the drive thru girl and it seemed other people there were having problems as well. The manager was scolding the drive thru girl so that let me know she had screwed up already with other orders. We will not be returning to this BK."}

{"text":"The East Carson Street Pizza Gauntlet Part 4.5: An Interlude  Kay and I had full bladders and couldn't stand Pi enough to want to relieve ourselves there. The 5th pizza place we wanted to try had become a full-on bar. I had seen another pizza parlor that I hadn't heard or read of before, so we made our way back up Carson to where we parked, in search of a bathroom and one more pizza place afterwards before ending our intensely chilled evening out on the tiles.   When we went back to the bathrooms, we found that both were locked.  Oh, you KNOW how this works: A few heroin junkies spoil it for the straight-edgers like me. Damn it.   We had to buy something before we'd be allowed to use the facilities.   I went through this before at a McDonald's last year on St. Paddy's Day. Hey, I was pressured into downing a yard of green beer.   Well, I orderd a Hi-C, and Kay had a Diet Coke. This was after waiting 20 minutes.   The gruff manager said \"I'll unlock the doors,\" with a smirk on his face. He had us. I smirked back since I knew what the racket was.   I urinated for what was seemingly an eternity, got back to our seat, and sipped on the Hi-C...with a pizza box in front of us. The gaggle of high-school kids across from us thought that was funny.  \"Do they eat Subway sandwiches at Wendys? Huh-huh-huh.\"  I felt like going over to explain our night to them but decided that it would be futile. What teenager even knows what Yelp is?   Alas BK, your burgers are dry, your onion rings bland, and you add/remove too many items from your menu. As Ronnie Dio used to sing...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZfrCPKEqM&feature=related  While we were here, we found someone to give our crappy Pi Coal Fired Pizza to.  P.S. My grandmother used to come to this BK when she was alive and living in South Side 2.5 decades ago. She would only come by to pilfer straws, sugar, plastic utensils, napkins, and coffee creamer. God Bless her. She may have been the subject of a certain Jane's Addiction song."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Ordered inside and waited on by a manager. He acted like he couldn't care less. Only ordered a Whopper Jr meal deal. Asked for cheese and paid for it, didn't get it. Manager told me I didn't order cheese. When when I showed him the receipt,  he swore and took the sandwich back. I got a a cold piece of cheese just thrown on thd sandwich. Sincd the sandwich was cold I request a replacement. He took the sandwich and threw it in the floor. He did replace it but it was cold. I just left rhe meal and wrote off the $5.00. Won't be back. Good luck getting their $15.00 per hour."}
{"text":"This location is absolutely horrible. The management is very unknowledgeable and unprofessional. They know nothing about the Shop Your Way program that Burger King now participates in. I would not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"This is the worst location by far! I called at 10:01 am and spoke with a gentlemen that informed me that breakfast was over at 11 am. I got to this location at 10:31 and was told that they had stopped serving breakfast at 10:30 am. There was nobody in line except for me and I had a screaming baby who was hungry and they would not serve me breakfast. Only lunch. So I left. I went to McDonald's. I was so upset that I called to talk to the manager and he was so unprofessional. He was the one who told me 11 but went back on his word and said no I told you 10:30. He never said I'm sorry or anything. Worst customer service ever. Not to mention they don't answer the phone at all. I called several times before anyone could answer. I even went as far as to call the corporate office but they don't answer either, nor did they even get back to me. Business establishments now a days are horrible. I will never eat at Burger King again in my life! Nobody cares anymore and these people who you have working have no understanding of what customer service is. Get it together. If I could give no stars I would."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning last night from a VEGGIE BURGER. Didn't know that was possible.  Time before that it took 21 minutes to get my food. I wrote to the company and didn't get a response. I am not returning to this location!"}
{"text":"Food wise? It's Burger King. It's not 5 star dining. Customer service wise? I've just had rude ladies each time I came here. I just stop going to this place just because of the service."}
{"text":"Ghetto. Dirty. Didn't have any soda because machine was broken so we had to get soda out a bottle. Sandwich looked like it was sat on. French fries COLD! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE, oh and they where out of bbq sauce. Keep in mind it's 5pm and they are out of everything. No discount NOTHING!"}
{"text":"Came here around 10pm on monday 10/16. The employee's, food, and service were awesome! Keep it up :)"}
{"text":"Every single time my family and I want to sit down and grab a bite at this burger king, the staff is always rushing us out the door and closing earlier than announced. I don't understand why. We came in tonight wanting try the mushroom king and grab some whopper's, but the staff said they weren't cooking anymore meat. On top of that, an employee was eating chicken nuggets in plain sight while handling customer food! This outrageous, I am disappointed and will be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS! This location is the worst fast food location I've been to in awhile. The only reason we have come back 2 or 3 times is because my daughter loves their rodeo burgers. Their drive through is ridiculous. No one knows how to handle a double lane drive through. There have been numerous times where I'll pull up to the mic and be waiting for someone to take my order when another car will pull up in the next lane and the drive-thru person will then start taking their order as if I hadn't been waiting for 3+ mins. They never get my order right. Every time we come here their shake/ice cream machines are always down. I'll order onion rings in place of regular fries and always get regular fries. This last time I ordered 3 meals and an extra burger. When I arrived home I realized I was missing a burger and one was incorrect. When I went back to express my concerns, a girl barked at me that I should have checked my bags before I drove off. I expect my bags to be correct. My job isn't to double check their work. Especially not after waiting in drive through for almost 10 mins."}
{"text":"Worst Burger King ever. They always forget to put your whole order in the bag. This time, the burger buns were old & dry.. bleh!"}
{"text":"In all fairness I am not a fan of fast food, but with 8 minutes to spare before my flight began boarding at gate C2 I figured this was my best bet to grab something quick...   I ordered a whopper junior without meat (literally just the bun and standard accoutrements), a large order of fries, and a bottle of water. The guy who took my order told me I could not have a large order of fries - only medium - since that's the way the meal came... I clarified and said I didn't order the meal - he said it didn't matter - this is what he rang up, and the meal comes with a medium order of fries... okay fine, whatever... He also asked me why I wanted a water since the meal came with a soda...........   The total for my \"meal\" was $13.85. For fast food that you can't customize - even at an airport - this is a rip-off. (The minimum wage in Nevada is $8.25/hour). Just to compare to another chain in a different state - at Wendy's at the Dallas Fort Worth airport in Texas you can get the same thing that I ordered here for $3.89... Lesson learned for me - I won't consider Burger King a worthy option for my hard earned money, no matter how rushed / hungry / desperate I am.   On a positive note, my \"meal\" was ready in 5 minutes and I made it to my gate with a minute to spare."}
{"text":"This has to be the most disgusting!  Burger King in NV! I ordered a cheeseburger and as I was eating it  I looked down and seen a weird long  String? Type looking thing? I still don't Know what! The hell! It was? It was really  Thin and sort of clear looking. I freaked  Out a little and hurried up and tossed it  In the trash, as I didn't want to scare my young children who was eating there chicken nuggets. I then grabbed the nuggets and tossed those also because I was scared that maybe someone working there either drop something in our food or the food itself was decomposing! Ecck!! It makes me want to vomit just thinking of  It. I wish I would have taken a picture of the unusual long string like particle in my food it was definitely something not normal and I should have made a complaint. The store is filthy inside and I will never go back in fact I might not ever go back to any fast food place again. Also the people who work there seem like they do not care about the customer or the food they almost always get the orders wrong and they themselves look filthy as well. their uniforms are covered in stains and they look very unsanitary."}
{"text":"I felt like having a burger so I ordered myself a whopper  with cheese well done no lettuce and extra pickles. Cashier was nice, and the manager was helpful. My burger could have been more well done, and less mayo and mustard, other than that the bread kept falling into pieces Really??? So I got myself a vanilla ice cream and by never again that ice cream sucked like spoiled milk!!anyhow place is what you pay."}
{"text":"Horrible service. My son went in with a whopper free meal coupon from school. I gave him a $20 in case he had to pay tax, he comes out with my change, $12.29. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. I went back in. You don't piss me off.  Cynthia took 10 minutes to do a refund. Poor customer service. Will NEVER be back. I'll see you soon Wendy's!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through and I was pleasantly suprised with the customer servive of an individual names Richard... Nice job management had great customer servive. He had great patience with my lovely wife who likes to changer her mind 5001 times."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been at this burger king and we will definitely come back! The food was hot and tasty,  they have fruit punch for my grand daughter, and the play ground is really clean and nice.  We had so much fun!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I went back here after the last issue I had here in the Fall.  Today I went in to get a Whopper Jr. value meal. The only soda they had  was a huge one in a non-Burger king foam cup. I was charged for a large, even though I only wanted a medium. The fries were not ready, so I had to wait about 6 minutes, meanwhile the Whopper Junior was getting cold.     I mentioned to an employee that there was a few slices of cheese on the floor behind the counter, I received no response.  I completed my Whopper Jr. and then went up to the counter to order a 4 piece Chicken Nugget. I paid and told the server that I wanted Sweet and Sour with those, he said \"we don't have sweet and sour\". I then requested Barbeque. He said they had no sauces..only Ketchup.   I asked why he didn't tell me that when I ordered and he said I didn't ask.  I requested a refund and was issued one. I also noticed that the cheese slices on the floor were still there. This place has terrible service, uneducated employees with no work ethic and no social skills. The work area looks very dirty."}
{"text":"I go through the drive thru at 9pm tonight and order two bacon double cheeseburgers with NO pickles and a large fry. I pull around and pay and the girl says \"if you want to pull around to the entrance I will bring it out when it is ready\" so I think ok cool I guess they are making it fresh. Man was I wrong! I waited a good 8-10 minutes for my food then drove home which is just down the road from the restaurant. I get my food out and am starving, my fries were soggy and Luke warm, both of my bacon double cheeseburgers with NO pickles were cold, the patties were burnt and dry, they each had only one piece of bacon (which I paid extra for) and they both had pickles. Well I am allergic to pickles so I unfortunately paid $8 and didn't eat a single bite of my food. This just goes to show how terrible Burger King has gotten and I won't be surprised if they all get shut down soon! Very disappointed I will never go back."}
{"text":"When you are in a hurry and a new BK opened up, you give it a try.  This is a small BK with about 7 tables and a few counter seats at the window by the entrance.  There was a short line but it moved fast and was surprised at how fast the food come out due to the number of people.  The soda machine is one of the newer style that you can pick about 100 options.  A nice new clean BK for a quick lunch.  Just right!"}
{"text":"No stars really, for this place. Mold, MOLD ON MY BREAD!!!! What the heck!?!? Please make sure to check your food before eating it. Didn't realize my chicken sandwich had mold until i bit into it and turned it upside down and noticed mold on the bottom slice of the bread. Called and spoke to the manager, took my food back and got my money back, but I will NEVER eat here again. I hope they are more careful with checking their food before passing it to the customer."}
{"text":"I understand that places like Burger King, Hardee's, or McDonalds just don't have high expectations. But the biscuit I just got from this Burger King is beyond the normal crap you get. The picture just shows what appears to be a scrap of biscuit pieces slapped together and held in place by cheese. But the picture can't display the rock hardness of said biscuit or the toughness of the sausage. No. Pictures can't do this hockey puck justice.  If you're thinking of stopping at this Burger King take this advice:  DON'T DO IT!!! Because one mistake is a mistake. But I opened my second biscuit to find it has a twin!!!!"}
{"text":"It's Burger King, so how do you review it?  This location probably isn't any better or worse than any other location.  I'm generally pleased when I walk over at lunch.  Chicken fries are awful, yes really awful.  But I don't order them after trying them once.  Anyway, my only complaint was a couple of weeks ago they had a worker who obviously had a cold or allergies going on and was coughing a lot.  It made me very uncomfortable eating there.  She was just working the cash register and not directly handling the food, but still, it's a food service place and she shouldn't have been at work that day.  I did get the flu with fever a week later."}
{"text":"Have not been to this Burger King since they remodeled. I have to say that I was very pleased with the service. The food was hot and delicious. My new favorite BK."}
{"text":"My friend and I went thru the drive thru after a day of shopping. I immediately see the huge sign on their menu board for chicken fries! Woohoo! When I tried to order them, I was promptly told they no longer had them....sooooo why are they still on the menu, with no sign saying they are no longer available? Anyway, we ordered something different and were on our way. Got home 45 minutes later and got out our sandwiches. The lettuce was really wilted and there were just a few small pieces on each sandwich. I get more lettuce on a McChicken from McDonald's!  The fries were hot and tasty. The sandwiches were good, but a lot smaller than the picture on the menu (go figure)."}
{"text":"0/10 would not recommend.  While the owner/manager dude was having a meeting with his employees in the dining area his other employees behind the counter were fumbling service and taking their sweet time.  It was as if they were moving through a pool of jello and they seemed confused like a child at a magicians show.  Meanwhile the owner barked at his employees who all had a glazed look of horror on their faces as they realized they had made a huge mistake by getting hired here.  As I left I turned my head towards the meeting and stated \"burger king sucks\".  I'm not sorry for it.  I meant it.  This place sucks. .  You might get your food faster if you dig in the trash.  This is a must avoid!  The king is dead the king is dead."}
{"text":"All the tables in the kids are were filthy, employees need more training for sure, maybe have at least one person with experience to teach them. And maybe teach them how to speak to customers. Hopefully it gets better with time, but for now 2 starts is all it gets."}
{"text":"So, my son and I wanted a bacon cheeseburger for lunch and BK was right there. We both orders a Double Bacon King Jr for $4.50 and this was just the sandwich. We got the burgers and they were exactly the same as the Double Bacon Jr for $2.19. I asked the manager what the difference was and why it was double the price. She claimed was supposed to get three two inch pieces of bacon, but we both got two. So, it was EXACTLY the same burger for double the price. She offered to put another slice of bacon on the burger, but we passed. I will add that the burger sucked and wasn't worth a penny over .99. Obviously, it's not her fault. I did call corporate and haven't received a call back yet."}
{"text":"I love Burger King and would prefer it over any other fast food restaurants but it is difficult to love the food here but strongly dislike the service. There are a lot of times when they have forgotten something in my order or was just plain rude. My last recent visit the guy gave me regular Coke when I specifically asked for Vanilla Coke then he sighs and in such an aggressive way empties my cup, and starts refilling it with Vanilla Coke. I am the type to apologize whenever I feel like an inconvenience so I said sorry to him but he ignored me and rolled his eyes. After getting my food he forgot my onion rings and my sauces I requested at the order box, he just gave it to me and closed his window without saying \"thanks for coming in.\" I hope they start changing up their employee's really quick, that guy seemed so rude and lazy! On top of that his hands were stink! Haha for real, my drink and the sauces/ bag he touched smelt disgusting. I only ate the food and touched the areas that did not smell bad. Yuck!"}
{"text":"745 pm Saturday night , family of 5 told play area was \"closed\" because they just mopped , we said we could wait and they said it was closed , 3 year old left crying actual dining room was open till 10 and the place was a ghost town , wonder why"}
{"text":"This review was originally started on the road about summer of 2014.  When you're on the road (long distance driving), eating options are few and far between them.  I kept hoping to find a Trader Joes or Whole Foods market but, no effing chance.  ------------------------------- Probably the worst \"fast food\" visit yet.  Not worst in the sense that I have a juicy story to share but that it took ever so long to get a small order fulfilled in comparison to their competitors next door.  Ya know, the motorist traveling the interstate is probably their most typical sort of consumer and their everyday challenge is to win some of that motorist business.   I would think that Burger King would staff only their best to support these needs of the weary traveler, yes? Maybe?  Absolutely not.   Their customer service is pretty good and their employees are able to converse appropriately but their turn around times in serving just plain STINK!.  In the not-so-recent past, upon visits to Chicago BK's I would remember staff asking drive-up customers to reverse or move forward so that they could fake out BK corporate about how quickly they could meet customer demand. (Faking out their drive-up window timers)  These kinds of requests were not made here.  Instead we waited and waited and waited, for typical, every-order, type BK items.  The wait was so long that we started taking note of how quickly their neighbor Arby's, were able to respond to their drive-up business in far more suitable times.  Originally we thought about hitting Arby's but they had a sizable line and for some reason we thought between the two fast food evils, this would be the better.  Wonk, wonk, wonk.."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Employees are rude when you ask them a simple question. Management needs to either train their employees on customer service or get new ones. Will never buy anything from here again."}
{"text":"Plain and simple, this location has never messed up my order.   They are quick, they are friendly, and they are clean.  This location is super close to work, so I'm here frequently.    they have a great selection on their \"value\" menu...  Oh and I LOVE the new fries!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, seriously I'm so over this location. I'm so sick of these employees and it's always the same bitch. If you don't like working with people then find a different job. It's a choice to work there, no one isn't forcing you to stay. I come to this location because it's close to my house but everytime the same bitch who takes my order in the drive thru is always rude. She practically threw my bag of food to me. She's always fucken rude. I'm so fucken done. If you guys aren't going to do anything about it, I'll take it to corporate and I'll make sure they will."}
{"text":"1 star, that's all i will give them. Why? Because i love Whopper's! Otherwise this place needs to be shut down. Dirty, outdated and 1 big hot mess inside this location. I was there just over a week ago and the play area (not a daycare people!) was so overpacked and nobody supervising - not even the parents. One of the kids got hit in the face and there was blood everywhere. None of the staff came to offer any help, just customers. It took forever for the \"manager\" to come out and say they were closing the play area. It took 10 minutes and nobody was even leaving!?! Such a shame and huge disappointed that there is no other Burger King nearby. They need a huge overhaul in customer service, cleanliness and maybe a reno because this place is an embarrassment to the Burger King brand. Head Office - get over there ASAP!"}
{"text":"From the time I ordered at 5:45, I did not get my burgers until 6:05. Twenty minutes in a drive-thru feels like two hours. When I reached the window, no apology, no acknowledgement of the wait. Just shoved the bag at me. Didn't even say \"thank you.\" Amazing. I'll drive farther from now on to go somewhere capable of executing the evidently challenging task of taking an order, taking payment for said order, and delivering fast food, you know, fast."}
{"text":"DO NOT EVEN THINK OF GOING TO A Burger King ISIDE THE AIRPORT IN CLT!!! First off the counter help are not very helpful. I'm almost sure that they couldn't pour piss out of a boot with the instructions on the bottom. The food is always cold and it takes forever to get it. Save yourself the aggravation and just don't do it!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst BK ever. The fries are either cold and hard as cardboard or soggy full grease and under cooked. The drinks taste like dish soap every time I go there. Just horrible all together."}
{"text":"This location has great service! Quick service and is always clean! Also employee DEANDRE is one of the best they got here 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, but the location wasn't listed - so now you know there is one here! Wanted to mention that unlike many of the other fast food places in the area, this one seems to be able to get orders right at the drive-thru - even special orders. Food is fast and correct, and if u ask me that is what counts at a drive-thru window."}
{"text":"I was going to log on and give them a good review. Order of 6 items was taken promptly and each of the bags handed to me at the DT Window had their contents inspected and read to me in a polite, efficient manner. Fries poking out of the bag were hot and fresh.  The Problem arose when I got home and unpacked 3 burgers, 1 fish and 1 fry. Again with the Drive-thru Curse. Why is it so hard for fast-food employees to count items and put them in a bag? I'm not spending two bucks in gas to go back for fries that cost them 15cents to make (including their labor and overhead)."}
{"text":"So I was in a hurry earlier today and was looking for something fast and stopped at Burger King. It has been over 10 years since I been there. My expectations were not very high. I figured a few bites of a whopper to hold me over for a few hours. Well, as I bit into the burger I was simply amazed at the taste of the whopper. Best fast food burger I have had, emphasize on fast food. If I knew that this would be the norm, I would go there more often. Service was average, which is ok. Ordered food, paid for food, got food.   Management team, figure out what you did today at about 330 pm and keep it up.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I thought I would give Burger King a try for breakfast. I was definitely not impressed. I used the drive thru, which was pretty fast service but they were not busy at all. My cashier was really friendly. Here's why I only gave this Burger King 2 stars. My food literally sucked. I ordered a croissant with bacon & cheese and a small order of hash browns. 1st my hash browns were not hot or fresh. They were cold & tasted like oil. As for my croissant??? Well the croissant itself seemed pretty soft & was fresh tasting. But the bacon was cold. There was nothing hot about it. It tasted room temperature. And my sandwich was really smashed. Why??? I don't know if you can tell from the picture that it was smashed, but it was. I've never seen a flat croissant before. I won't go to this Burger King again unless there is nothing else open & im starving!!"}
{"text":"We ordered breakfast here during a layover. My croissant was literally dripping cloudy looking water.  Since we plopped down almost 20 bucks, I tried forcing it down until I felt something odd in my mouth.,,  a hair that neither matched my hair's color or ethnicity.  This BK should be shut down!!!!"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience. Martha, the cashier, was very difficult to place an order with. I ordered a #2 breakfast, declined the coffee and asked for a cup or ice water. She states \"you don't want the combo then, just the sandwich.\" I said, \"No I want the combo which is sandwich and hash browns, no coffee, just water.\" I have previously ordered the exact order before and changed the coffee for a soda and never had this problem. After 3 minutes of bantering with Martha, with her saying \"some people\" with m right in front of her, I asked to speak to a supervisor. She said there was not one there, which was a lie, because I spoke with one later. She asked another employee, Laron, to help me and my order was placed in less than a minute. After this whole fiasco, the food croissant came out so hot I burned my mouth and the eggs an the bacon had a horrible overcooked taste to it. I frequently eat at Burger King for breakfast, but this location should be avoided at all costs. You have been warned!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited 12 minutes for a whopper junior without cheese. Gave me one with cheese. Asked for another. Place is ran by teenagers who don't care about anything but the 8 dollars at the end of the hour."}
{"text":"I eat at this place all the time when my family is hungry and for something fast.  I'm not going back and I don't recommend to anyone. We went there tonight with our kids for there .50 cent cones and play in there new play area. The kids ran into the play room to play while my husband and I went to the counter to order. Barely anyone inside and no one at counter by us. There was only one female in grey uniform who had head phones on came up to counter, my husband said hello and she did not give us the time of day, took a cookie and walked back to kitchen. We stood there for another 10 mins and no one came up to us and said anything! We took our kids out of play area and went to McDonalds down the street. I will never go back and I hope they fire the lady due to her poor customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent Burger King as far as speed and taste of food. Service could be better as the employees are not as friendly as a customer favoring employee should be."}
{"text":"Tried to overcharge me for a double cheeseburger and then when I tried to explain to the manager what happened they seemed to not have a clue how to fix (I had to explain it to them about 4 times for them to understand and then i pretty much had to spell out what they should do to make it right).  The place doesnt look very clean and I would consider this to be below the standards for most burger kings."}
{"text":"Food came out quick, was nice and hot and tasty.  The landscaping of the surrounding property could use some cleaning up, but the BK seems fine in general."}
{"text":"It's usually good food. The inside is clean and decent every time I have gone in. I mean it is just fast food, so temper your expectations, order a bacon double cheeseburger and some onion rings, and u will be good to go"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly!  I actually saw another patron introducing his family (he was an older gentleman with his wife and middle aged son and his family) to the staff of this BK.  I have never seen BK bring someone to tears, but that day it happened.  The man had genuine love for the staff of this place and they all knew him as well.  Fast food greatness."}
{"text":"Rude employees, they re cooked the fries and then I asked them to give me new ones but they took 20 minutes to give me fresh ones. It doesn't take more the 3 minutes. And when he gave them to me he gave me attitude as well but I just ignored him."}
{"text":"The worst BK! I hardly ever go but if I'm moving fast and don't have a chance to cook breakfast..this one is horrible. Drive through staff is never friendly. Food is always cold. They never give a receipt. Why keep going there? Hoping staff and management have been fired and new employees who care about the service they provide are in place. I know, I'm expecting too much...It's BK!"}
{"text":"Just another high priced fast food joint inside the casino.  Customer service was good.  Food was hot. They always have a line when I go tho. I just grabbed some nuggets because they are advertised at $1.49.  I'm surprised they honor the sales, usually they don't."}
{"text":"Curious about their heavily advertised reduced-fat french fries, \"satisfries.\" we stopped for a quick lunch.  Their regular fries are straight-cut and the satisfries are ridged. One pays a premium for the satisfry, so one kinda expects them to appear in one's little baggy.  There were maybe 5 satisfries, one onion ring and 25 or so regular fries in my bag. So I paid a premium and got whatever fell out of the fry baskets onto the catch-tray beneath. Everything in my bag was cold and not very good.   The lady, who's satisfries were more prevalent in her order than mine, tasted them and just set them aside. Neither of us are huge fans of cold fried stuff. The sandwiches were cold as well, so this visit was a total bust."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!  The expeditor was rude, they forgot my cheese and bacon, charged me $3.50 for a bottled soda.  Then, when I got back to my seat, they had forgotten the mayo and mustard.  Needless to say, I ate my dry burger with unmelted cheese because it was easier than throwing everything back in my bag and heading up to the counter.  The overall attitude of the staff was crappy - like they were bothered to fix my order.  Never again!"}
{"text":"This is a nice-looking building in a not-so-nice area. They have two Coca Cola Freestyle machines and a self-serve ICEE machine. Looked promising but we didn't see chicken fries on the menu, and never got a chance to ask because we stood there for about 5 minutes and no one bothered to greet us. So we left."}
{"text":"THEY DON'T WEAR GLOVES.  I watched a lanky kid behind the counter scratch his face then shove some stray fries into their container with the same bare face-scratching hands.  I was mildly grossed out.  Then I realized the fries belonged to me.  Now we're beyond mild.  This is ready-to-eat food.  Being exposed to all the face-scratching, sneezing, money-handling, and other random contaminants out there.   I wanted salt, not Hepatitis A seasoning my fries  So I did the unthinkable.  I brought it up.  And when I did, I was told glove-wearing is a manager's choice.  Well, going there is a customer's choice, so I'll definitely be finding my dinner elsewhere.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and they have two lanes like McDonald's! Never seen that at BK before. I didn't see the chicken parm sandwich on the menu so I asked if they still had it. The girl said yes and asked if I wanted the combo. I said yes. When I got to the window, the gal told me my total and I said, \"That's for the combo?\" She said, \"Oh you wanted the combo?\" and told the guy behind her to add an order of fries. Then I heard him say something about knowing it was a combo, so I guess he heard my order but she didn't ring it up correctly. No big deal. I got my food and went on my way. I noticed my receipt said \"crispy chicken\" so I wasn't sure if that was an indicator that they're doing away with the chicken parm? I hope not cuz it's a pretty tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"0 stars if i could!!!!...didn't think i would ever wait 5 minutes to be greeted in the drive thru of a fast food spot EVER!!and when they finally come on the speaker \"ok what can i get started?\" in THE MOST \"i hate my life\" voice ever..comical enough to write a review about it WOW..."}
{"text":"At the drive-thru I was handed a coke that over-flooded onto the lid.  It's spilled on me, and on my car.  Yes- my car is lower then the drive-Thur window and I could not see the top of the drink.  At home I discovered my two whoopers were mixed up.  I called at 10pm, Thursday night, July 27th, to rectify the issue.  The responses I received from the BK employee over the phone was, \" I know the order was right, I made myself.\"    I called her out for indirectly calling me a liar, then hangs up on me for being quote unquote rude.   If I had an allergy to onions or dairy, what would she have told me then?  Would she have continue to indirectly call me a liar?  Food order should be taken very seriously, and if incorrect, it should not be approached by placing accusations.  I had no clue who made the order, I just called in to say it was incorrect. She took it upon herself to take immediate offense and challenged the integrity of the caller.  She then say, \"let me take your name down, I'm assuming you JUST want a 'FREE' burger.\"  Free?! My order was incorrect and then she expected me to dive back tonight?  It's my time and money wasted for her incompetence and frankly rude attitude.  She hung up on me- twice.   I have been a loyal customer, and I am extremely disappointing to be treated as if I am some sort of scum bag trying to con BK out of some free whoppers.    The way I see it- this BK representative is attempting to con me out of my hard earned money and time for an incorrect order.  Her highly immature manner along with her poor customer service skills not a good combo.   She is truly a class act employee."}
{"text":"Normally, I enjoy coming here for a quick bite when I don't have time for a long sit down lunch.  I went there yesterday and ordered the Original Chicken Sandwich and a small drink.  When I took a bite of the sandwich, I noticed there was a long strand of hair in between the chicken and the bread.  After looking further, I found another strand.  To say the least, I was disgusted and simply left after throwing away the sandwich.  Again, normally they do a great job, but today wasn't one of them."}
{"text":"After being yelled at by 2 clerks for having a service dog (they wanted to see a card.  There are no 'cards'), I do believe that one of the cooks spit on my hamburger.  I saved the burger but I am too grossed out to look at it again.  I didn't even give it to my dog it was so disgusting!  I am not only going to Yelp this, I am going to write corporate and let them know.  I know it's only BK, but I'm spending my money there just like I would at Maggianos.  Customer service should be the same everywhere; GOOD!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from San Diego and staying at the Fairfield right next door and decided to go over and grab some food. Should have avoided and listed to the other reviews but we didn't feel like driving anywhere. We had a simple order of a whopper,chicken nuggets,and the whopper burrito thing. We stood at the register for a couple of minutes as employees just walked by saying nothing. Then the manager girl walks up complaining how they always seem to get busy when she's trying to take a break. So sorry to interrupt your break to make you do your JOB. Then watching the guy make our order was painful. Slow as hell and clearly just didn't care. He wrapped the burrito including lettuce and tomato and then preceded to microwave the whole thing. Then another 10 minutes goes by as people who came in well after us got their orders and we were still waiting 16 minutes for a simple order at a FAST food joint and my whopper was not even hot. All the reviews are similar to our experience,fire them and CHANGE something. This is why i rarely eat fast food."}
{"text":"Whopper was cold and sloppily made. Got sick. Health department needs to make a surprise visit."}
{"text":"This place is always dead. The restaurant is  dirty. The employees are rude. Go somewhere else. This place doesn't want your business."}
{"text":"Tried this Burger King again. I sat in line at the drive thru for 45 minutes while the three employees just stood around. I left without getting anything. I watched 4 other customers just give up and leave before I did."}
{"text":"The restaurant was dirty, the food was not cooked all the way. The staff was not paying attention to the customers. I always loved BK but it has gone down hill for a while. I won't be coming back to this location or any BK for that matter. Save your money and go someplace else instead."}
{"text":"Just visited this place yesterday with a friend and it was okay and decent but the food was good but the service could be much better to be honest. I paid almost seven dollars for just a Double Whooper. I felt ripped off and I think I will give them one more chance to make it up for this. The cashier was very nice but did not make eye contact with me while ordering either."}
{"text":"Stopped by Burger King for breakfast and ordered two sausage biscuits for $2.00. The server was fast and friendly. The biscuits were hot and the sausage was tasty, but the biscuits were falling apart. They were not made correctly. Hopefully, this doesn't keep happening because I grab this breakfast on the go often."}
{"text":"I'm writing about the new XT burgers.  Wow!  These are good.  I saw the picture and the advertising about 1/3 lb of beef so I thought I'd try one.  These are the best burgers Burger King has ever offered.  The XT burgers are about as big as a burger you would get at a sit-down restaurant.  And they only cost $3.99 each, which is about half of what you would pay at a sit-down restaurant, not to mention your tasty XT burger is ready in less than 5 minutes.  Way to go BK!"}
{"text":"The worst people I have seen in the business. I asked the hostess to substitute a veggie Patty in the 4 cheese burger and she her to make sure that there was no meat in it. She took like half an hour to check if they could even make it like that. I mean what the ****! And then when I get my Burger, there was no patty in it....! What the **** ! So, I go back to the hostess and I was like where is the patty...? She is like you said no meat. I was like yeah... That's why I asked you to sub a veggie patty. And her response was gold. She said that they consider ALL the patty to be meat. And the worst part is that they were all laughing at me for wanting a 4 cheese burger with veggie patty...!  I didn't want to create a scene... But these people need to respect the customers... The stupid ungrateful bunch of illiterate jerks....!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous.  I had just done some physically demanding work and needed something to hold me over till dinner, so I ordered a Whopper Jr. It was the size of a kids burger plus it was old and disgusting.(I have eaten at Burger King many times and it was the wrong sized burger) I ate it because I was starving. It was definitely one of the worst burgers I have ever ate. The child behind the register however was quite polite. There was no use complaining as I had many errands to run and even if they gave me something for free on the next visit I would not eat it. I will never eat at that location again.I try to find something good everywhere but if I could give it zero I would. In case the manager reads this it happened on 11/02/13 at around 3:45pm"}
{"text":"I went tonight thru the drive thru for some food. When I pulled up to the speaker I was told to order when I was ready. I said i needed a moment as i had no clue what i wanted. The lady taking my order then started to hum as i was trying to decide. You know like that impatiently waiting kind of hum. I've never been so disrespected in a fast food place as I was tonight. There was no cause for her to do that as i literally only took like 30 seconds. I got to the window and it was a different person i could tell by her voice. I asked her what the other girls name was and how to make a complaint. She told me the girls name was anita and to contact the exchange."}
{"text":"5 stars or 1 star?  Ok, let's be real, the only time in history any fast food restaurant ever got 5 stars is from Ronald McDonald's mom.  When all things are considered like friendliness, cleanliness and the quality of the food I have to honestly say that my experience eating at this location wasn't that bad.  The counter person was upbeat and helpful and didn't look bored. I know that's like telling your sister she's really not THAT ugly but it counts.  Service time was fast and the place is spotless, but again that's a qualified compliment because after all they are brand new.  I ordered the new Double Quarter Pounder King without thinking at the time, holy cow (um, sorry) that's a half pound of meat. If you, like me, prefer your hamburger to be meat, cheese, bun and maybe a pickle slice you will be in nirvana with this burger. There is absolute no frilly foo-foo half-wilted veggies or anything else to distract from the taste of meat and cheese, and yes there is enough of both that you can actually taste them. There was also  a smattering of chunks of raw onion and despite the horrified warnings of big city food critics that you NEVER put ketchup on a hamburger, the Double Quarter Pounder King was in your face with a huge dosage of tangy red good old American ketchup.  I would have been in ham(burger) heaven except when the clerk told me the price ... $8.39 for one burger and a small \"value\" drink, the burger alone is $6.29.  Are you kidding me, Burger King?  You actually think you can compete against Five Guys, Smashburger, Culvers, Fuddruckers and all of the other burger joints that are competing in that price range?  Answer: I don't think so.  I liked my burger but I will never buy one again at that price.  On the not-so-flip-side of this review are two things ... first is that the only place they tell you that price before you buy it is in lettering smaller than a cockroach riding a tricycle on their reader board.  That sort of rubs it in, doesn't it?  You've got a Godzilla-sized poster in the window publicizing this new burger, I think it borders on dishonesty to hide the price in such tiny text behind the counter.  The other questionable, if not weird, thing is after I got my drink I came back to the counter and found the counter clerk holding my burger in his bare hands ... just the burger, which he was handing to me and when I looked a little surprised he offered \" do you want me to just hand it to you\"?  I almost LOL'd and said \"no, I'll take a tray\"."}
{"text":"Since uniformity is probably the most important goal of fast-food restaurants, I usually see no reason to review them unless a particular location stands out and should be recognized for something.  I mean, a Big Mac technically should taste and look the same anywhere, and if there are slight variances that does not warrant writing a review for that particular location (again, unless that location offers something superior to other fast food restaurants of that brand).  So this review is a little shout out to the Burger King at Union Hills Drive and Cave Creek Road in Phoenix.  I was there on a Sunday evening and business was slow.  I saw 3 employees in the dining room area.  One of them was the cook and the other two were counter workers.  Both of the counter workers were a cut above compared to most fast food workers ... they really seemed to enjoy working with people.  I ordered the Whopper Barbecue Burger, which I had not tried before.  I was able to see the cook prepare the burger while I waited (I could only see hands, not a face, so I don't know which gender the cook was).  I have seen that sight many times before and it is obvious that fast food is fast because it is thrown together in the minimal amount of time ... and usually looks it.  The person making my burger was assembling it like it was being prepared for him/herself and his/her family.  He/She placed each piece carefully centered in place, finally topping it gently with the top bun and wrapping it with the care he/she would use for a wedding present.  When I opened the sandwich to eat it, it looked like a billboard ad for Burger King.  In addition to taste and smell, the way food looks is an important part of its sensory appeal.  In some small way I believe this sandwich actually tasted better just because it looked so good.  I didn't see a manager around, so extra kudos go to this young staff who took the responsibility to provide a quality product along with great customer service."}
{"text":"Writing a review about Burger King or any fast food place is futile. Most things that would normally be in a review like quality of food and prices are fixed anywhere you go. What varies is service and cleanliness, but those can vary at any particular location daily or even hourly.  So why is this review only 2-stars? Because it is the location I go to most often. I've never had a problem with the quality of food. And the service is okay. And other than they tend to be slow about getting around to cleaning the tables, it's reasonably clean.  What drags them down is their prices. I ordered a standard Whopper and a \"value\" drink (no fries) and my bill was almost $8.00. The so-called value drink was what I would consider a child's size.  I can name numerous places to get a burger in Phoenix where I can get a much better burger than a Whopper for the same price. I asked the counter person if that was a mistake and he said no they've raised their prices across the board. Isn't it a quite a coincidence that McDonalds raised their prices substantially as well.  I can get a MUCH better burger for the same price at Paradise Valley Burger, which is in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"It's really easy for everyone (me included) to beat up on fast food places, and they usually deserve it. After all, who's going to take the time to write a NICE review about these places?  That's why most of them rarely have more than one or two stars.  I rate fast food places using a little different standard than I do for real restaurants.  I start at zero instead of in the middle or at the top of the ratings and if they deserve zero I don't even bother wasting my time telling people to avoid the place ... everyone already knows that.  That being said, I am writing a review and you've already noticed that it's 4-stars. Why? Because this location earned it. Other than a wacky parking lot, which I'm sure wasn't their choice, the impressions are good and stay good during the entire visit ... except for one glaring problem that I'll get to in a minute.  I walked in close to noon on a weekday and, although there was a small crowd, I had my order taken immediately. The server was upbeat and friendly (when was the last time anyone said that about a server at a fast food place?) and he got my order right.  Since it was early lunchtime there wasn't a backlog of burgers going stale under a heatlamp so the one I got was made fresh for me.  The server actually thanked me when he handed it to me.  By the way, I had a Whopper, which is my favorite Burger King sandwich. The closest McD's ever got to making anything as good as a Whopper was their McD.L.T back in the 80's. They discontinued it because of some BS about the Styrofoam container ... typical of the way McDonald's thinks. They're the company with an executive who told me recently that they never listen to customer suggestions, that the only people who know what the customers want are their franchise owners. Huh?  Anyway, back to Burger King. Other than the burger my trip to this particular location was positive across the board. As others have mentioned it is MUCH cleaner than most and as I watched one young lady clean off the tables I could tell that she actually cared if they were clean.  So, what's my beef? (Yeech, sorry about the pun!!!)  The freakin' Whopper and the smallest drink size was $5.38.  If I had ordered the combo it would have been $6.49 PLUS TAX!  On what planet in what universe does Burger King think a fast food hamburger is worth that much?  Do they not have a clue what that much money can buy at pretty much every one of their competitors?  As I'm writing this I'm listening to news reports about Burger King's massively botched TV commercial in which a guy holding his huge whopper in his hand tells people to Google what's in a Whopper.  The results are one of the biggest PR blunders in advertising history.  I'm only taking one point away for the high price however; because I know pricing is a corporate decision and the local managers don't have anything to do with it. But nevertheless I am taking that star away so maybe the franchise owner reads this and calls HQ and asks them if they are purposely trying to put the company out of business.  It's important that the franchise owner does that because god knows that we mere customers don't know crap about anything.  [EDIT]  After I posted this review I tried to take the survey that's printed on the back of the receipt. The survey asks what the store # is. No problem with that. Then it asks for the \"survey code\" printed on the receipt. There isn't a survey code printed on the receipt so at that point the survey tells me to go away, they're not interested in my opinion. I tried to contact Burger King through the \"customer feedback\" form at their website to let them know all this. When I was done filling in the form I hit \"submit\" and it accepted my comments, but guess what?  Nowhere do they ask my name, email address, phone number or ANY other way of knowing who I am. So who (if anybody) reads our \"customer feedback\" and how can they possibly do anything about any issues like Speed of Service, Cleanliness, Taste of Food, Temperature of Food, Portion Size, Foreign Object in Food, Illness/Allergy, Undercooked Product, Food Related Injury, Nutritional Information and more if they won't accept feedback in any form from their customers?  So I guess they are just like McDonalds after all.  I'll keep my rating for THIS restaurant at 4-stars for cleanliness and friendly service but my rating of Burger King corporation is now 0-stars.  And attention BK executives, you promised me a free Whopper if I took your survey ... you owe me a free Whopper ... pay up!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a breakfast and requested for the upgrade to a large.  The meat was a little funky and the large coffee felt a little light. I removed the lid to find the cup was only 2/3's full.  I asked him to fill it up which he did.  Gotta watch this Location if you decide to support it.  I went there last night and tried the filet of fish---NASTY!"}
{"text":"Okay - if you're coming to Burger King, you know what you're getting yourself into. Typical fast food. And I will not lie - I've never had a burger from BK. Growing up, we didn't eat beef, so I never wanted to have one.   So this particular restaurant has its ups and downs. The drive through is really slow though, which is why I had to knock one star down. Even if there is nobody in line, they take forever to get your food out to you. And the sad thing is, it's usually cold and dry when you get it.   The inside is usually very sticky and not clean. I will not lie, I don't like going inside very much. I've done it maybe twice since I've been here.   And lastly, the service isn't the best. I've had some really rude employees but I've also had some nice ones. The managers are usually rude to you but I can't blame them - they are right across from a middle school so they have to run a tight ship.   Average food, okay service. Sorry BK - not my favorite place in the world. Only go there because of their onion rings."}
{"text":"What is this???? I want my burger made with love. Not hate. I know damn well I didn't waste my money on something so small."}
{"text":"Came here on a late Friday night with the goal of just getting some quick take-out. Not much to say about the actual food - it is what it is according to typical fast food standards. There was definitely something a bit \"off\" and depressing about this Burger King. The service itself was quick enough at the late hour (as there was just a handful of others in the place). Something about seeing multiple single men passed out (or nearly passed out) at their own tables that was off-putting..."}
{"text":"After finishing my meal, I visited the restroom.  As I finished washing my hands, a crew member who had finished defecating walked out of the stall and exited the restroom without washing his hands, and proceeded to walk through the kitchen area.  I will never set foot inside this BK franchise again.  If you want to risk food poisoning due to this particular crew member not giving a damn about following food safety rules and violating health codes, you've been warned."}
{"text":"This is the only BK in town. I go in the mornings, the drive thru girl is rude. Gave them a few chances, still rude. I go through drive through tonight, took a minute for them to say hello, which is fine. I ordered a large fry, 2 ranch sauces, and a original Oreo milkshake. I posted a pic of my fries which look more like a medium with as well as they filled it up, and my vanilla Oreo shake tasted like strawberry. Good thing I'm not allergic.  Lived in BC most of my life, come here often. This place is going down hill. I don't think i wanna come back."}
{"text":"I understand it's Burger King but I checked in here for the sole purpose of telling others how bad this location is! With at least 5 people on staff and an empty restaurant..... please tell me how the hell i am waiting 20 god damn minutes for a drive thru order that was two on the menu sandwiches with no changes? In addition, when the manager of the store delivered the order to the car not even a goddamn apology.  Shameful customer service! I don't even have to look to know that there's something screwed up with my order ....disgraceful I truly wish that yelp would let you rank negative stars"}
{"text":"I don't know what the girl at the drive thrus' problem is this morning 11/17 but she does not deserve to have a job. Pissed me right off this morning clearly has no idea what is going on and doesn't seem to care.  Never going back there and beware to everyone else!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the slowest and rudest fast food place I've ever been to. Got super sick last time I ate there. They will have you waiting 7 to 10 min for nuggets. No other cars around but they have you pull around and wait. For some reason this location can never get it together. Last 8 yrs that I've gone there. I only visit once or twice a year because I usually get taco bell for fast food."}
{"text":"I just want to give credit to the young lady who was working the drive thru cash window today, Fri. Aug 8, 2014 @ 11:49am.  I wish I got her name because I want her to be the one to get all the praise.  I was at the drive-up, waited a little bit, she came on, apologized for the wait and took my order.  When I drove up to pay, she greeted me with the warmest smile, handed back my change in the way all should...coins first, then paper money so I don't have to try to balance while getting it back into my car and then Thanked me, said have a great day....ALL WITH A SMILE.....I hope her supervisor or someone in the Burger King organization gives her the recognition she deserves!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Slowest Burger King E-V-E-R. Seriously, even the DMV is faster than this place. There were 9 people ahead of me in the queue. After 20 minutes there are still 7 people ahead of me. Hell, in the time it took them to make just one order, I've added this business to yelp, and wrote this review.  Oh my god... Finally ordered, now there 10 people ahead of me waiting for their order.  30 minutes (for now) and counting to get just a whopper.  (In case you're wondering, the only reason that I'm waiting this long for a mediocre burger is that my flight is delayed and I have nothing better to do.)"}
{"text":"Not good to be mopping the floors at 1pm, lunch time especially with handicapped person with cane coming in.  Cold in dining room. Need more 4 seat low tables for handicapped persons. Didn't get order correct,  but husband won't let me correct situation, ordered onion rings,  got fries"}
{"text":"Stopped by here yesterday because we were famished with hunger. The cashier was extremely friendly, the food was fresh, and the dinning room clean. It seemed like an older restaurant which I thought was cool. It even has this really cool round table when you walk in.   For Burger King corporate: I ordered a double cheese burger and assumed the cook made it wrong because there was only one slice of cheese on it. I didn't care that much and decided to check out your website today and realized that they did make it right. Only one slice of cheese on a double cheeseburger is standard? I recall working for Burger King when I was about 16 years old and I am pretty sure a double cheeseburger came with two slices of cheese, not just one. Change this you cheese hoarders!!!! Your french fries are amazing though. Thank you for that!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cheap fast food meal Burger King has some good deals recently. $1 iced coffees, $1.49 10 piece chicken nuggets, and 5 for $4 meal (includes a bacon cheeseburger, crispy chicken nuggets, small fries, small drink, and a chocolate chip cookie). They also recently added hot dogs to their menu which seems to receiving positive responses. I tried the chili dog one and it tasted good and was cheaply priced (about $2 I think). While I don't stop at Burger King often when I visit this location I am usually treated well and the service is prompt."}
{"text":"Horrible service here. If I could give negative one star I would. Today we specifically asked for 2 regular hamburgers and 2 rodeo cheeseburgers. The girl at the first window even verified our order again before we paid. Then when we got home we ended up with 2 cheeseburgers (marked hamburger on the wrapper) and 2 rodeo burgers (no cheese.) They constantly get the orders wrong. I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"It's a Burger King and nicer than most. Clean, friendly staff and a nice play area... A little slow on the service though."}
{"text":"On 2/4/16, @ 7:11 p.m., we went to try the new Dr. Pepper shake (so that I could give it a review on social media). (We also ordered a large Big King combo meal, Bacon Cheeseburger, & lg drink that were average. The Bacon Cheeseburger only had a tiny piece of bacon, so it was basically just a small cheeseburger.) The restaurant had dirty tables and floor, yet no guests were inside, and the employees were not busy. The Dr. Pepper shake did not taste like Dr. Pepper, but rather a VANILLA shake with a scant teaspoon of almond extract. Therefore, I gave them a 2nd chance, on 2/11/16, @ 2:23 p.m. This time they said that the shake machine was broken and that they didn't even have any Dr. Pepper soda either.  Also, the \"Host\" taking the order was rude, impatient, and kept repeating our order incorrectly."}
{"text":"My favorite burger king.. been going there a few times monthly for years and they have never shorted an order and food is always great."}
{"text":"This place was neat! I've never been to such a cool restaurant. I didn't know that places like this existed! Hashtag awesome."}
{"text":"Traditionally, I would avoid such a cholesterol-raising endeavor, but the other day the craving called, and who am I to deny it? Exactly. I casually drove up to the Drive-Thru and was greeted by a surprisingly delightful amount of enthusiasm that I had thought was generally reserved for finer dining establishments such as Chipotle.   Anyway, after efficiently taking my order and politely instructing me as to what one should do next in order to keep the transaction rolling smoothly, I was then called \"dear\". Hand to Jesus, I was now being spoken to with endearment. For a brief moment I was filled with warmth and a longing for my mother's embrace.... So I pulled forward.   At the window, I was elated to finally meet the woman who had shown me such love so early on in the relationship. Her smile was authentic and her cheery demeanor emanated from within. She also had wicked tight hair. The joyful face-to-face conversation was above and beyond any that I had encountered in such situations of the past. Her co-worker, who was scooping up the piping-hot fries also chimed in with some pretty sweet one-liners. I had died and gone to Burger King Heaven.   Compliments were flying, and the fries were a frying, but it was time to move on for all of us, and although hard, I pulled away with what was truly a remarkable fast-food encounter and vowed to write a review.   All of us foodies pretend, that these little blights on our palates don't exist, but lets be real... We all still occasionally visit  the king or the arches. Let us not hide in shame, but tell of our journeys and make the road less traveled better known.   10 Jazz Fingers to the fine ladies of Severance Center's BK... They made it my way!"}
{"text":"Firstly, let me share this: I know working in a fast food place is not the most desirable job but if you choose it, make it your best until you find something else or move up within the company. The guy working the register needs some serious training. As I approached the counter to place my order (no one else was waiting in line) this guy is just staring into space with his mind on how many holes are in the ceiling tile. I then see him notice me looking at him and still nothing. No greeting of any kind. So I stand there and stare back. Still nothing. This staring contest goes on for about 2 minutes before he fumbles out, \"Can I help you?\" to which I reply \"There you go buddy! I knew you could do it!\" He then says \"Do what?\" I finally say \"Just take my order please!\" Never have I seen someone so clueless. Maybe he should just go count salt and pepper packets to keep the mouse running in his head."}
{"text":"Wrong food. Still wrong when it was corrected. Waited 20 minutes just to have to ask for them to fix my order twice. Can't waste that much time for fast food"}
{"text":"Its the same as any other Burger king. Not a fan of the California Burger or maybe they didn't make it right. The guacamole was way to salty. No need to mess with guac leave it alone BK."}
{"text":"11-27-16:  Finally did a remodel of a old tired out lobby, looks much nicer and modern. Still NO internet, come on catch up with your competition.   Still same lousy service though. A customer informed the counter help the ketchup dispenser was empty. I ate my burger and watched a little AZ Cardinals lose another game and NOT ONE employee went to change out the ketchup dispenser. Go figure!"}
{"text":"Burger King is Burger King...this place is always clean, which is a good thing. I just wish they had their coke and tea available to customers.   It's a pain to try to get them to assist you for refills, guess they are all about cost savings rather than taking care of customers as other Burger Kings do."}
{"text":"Wow I can't believe I found a burger joint worse than McDonald's. Rofl talk about zzzzzlow zzlow. 20 min for a small fry and a single burger no cheese no veg. Ghetto ghetto. Goto gas station for better food fast service."}
{"text":"I was standing out of line waiting for my food; I listened to a lady talk down on the manager for 10 minutes easy. He handled it very professionally, very calmly, and with firmness. The lady didn't understand how to take advantage of a deal, but she didn't bother to ask how, yet it's the employees' fault they didn't inform her. Then she proceeds to tell the manager how upset she is that he refused to refund money that wasn't owed to her. Now she's telling everybody that they \"took advantage of her\". All because she paid 75¢ to add an ice cream cone.  10/10 show. Good job manager guy (nick berns), you stuck to your guns.  Oh yeah the food is always fresh and the place is always clean!"}
{"text":"I go to BK because I know they have the flavored coke machines, I don't understand why you would put one of those machines in if you are not going to stock the flavorings. This is the second time I have been to this one with the same issue"}
{"text":"I feel silly for even writing this but I just need to vent somewhere. I'm not kidding when I say that they took 45 MINUTES to fulfill my meal. Why did I wait so long?! I have no idea. I could've ran home and cooked a meal with that time, I know. The workers were the slowest moving workers I've ever seen. I'm not kidding when I say that they were moving like they had all the time in the world. There was only 1 man running around trying to get things together. I honestly didn't even know who to complain to because even the manager looked lost and confused. Beware of wait times, even the drive thru was backed up and waiting."}
{"text":"The cheese burgers are quite gross. The cheese is what I imagine fake, fake cheese is like. There is some ingredient in the beef that does not work with my taste buds. The fries are okay. The chicken nuggets and sandwiches are also passable. However I do not plan on visiting another Burger King any time soon."}
{"text":"forget the have it yourway! they never got our order correct. called the mgr. she replaced it after a 16 mile round trip to get the replacement.  it was still wrong when i got home. even the mgr cant get it right!!!! the owner needs to clean house!!!"}

{"text":"So disappointed! I just recently had my first Whopper and let me tell you I loved it. I went to this location ordered 2 Whoppers, 1 Fish, 1 Chicken, 1 large Fry and 1 large Onion Ring. You would have thought I ordered the entire store. I made my order at 10 am and did not leave till 10:30!! What a joke...  The asst. manager Lazaro was so checked out. He was not leading his team, the store was filthy, food everywhere. Not one person in the store seemed to care about anything. They screwed up my order 3 times and had to re make it.   Lazaro was looking at me like I was the bad guy. Get it together people, it is just Burger King. Everything gets cooked the same way every time. So after this long awaited wait, I finally got home. Could not even finish this food, it was the absolute worst thing I have ever tasted. I think they were using old meat. I had to toss in the trash because of my fear of food poisoning.  Thanks a lot Lazaro for your great leadership skills. (NOT!!) Most people would be thrilled to have a job in this economy and do it with pride. I will never return to this location. You have most likely ruined my Whopper experience."}
{"text":"This place is all about the money.  Burger King makes an ok jr spicy chicken sandwich.  To make it a good sandwich we found that you add a creamy buffalo sauce to it.  This location refused to provide this sauce at no charge..  We will not be going back to this one.  Don't go to this burger King drive the extra distance to go somewhere else.  They even charge 25 cents for sauce for your nuggets.  STAY AWAY.  -"}
{"text":"Ok ok ok! I get it! I'm yelping about a ff joint. Pathetic I know. Even I MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE FOR DOING WHAT IM ABOUT TO DO...but this ff chain is SO AWFUL I HAD too!!!!!! I hate Burger King! It's the worst fast food out there & to top it off this location is painfully slow & messed up my order. Ordered 2 different types of chicken sandwiches & a 6 PC kids nugget. Get home & they put a kids burger in my bag. I didn't want to even go in the first place. $21 later for the worst fast food ever, chicken is all breading and 1/16 of an inch of actual pressed chicken slime. Just go to Jack in the Box right down the street a mile if you MUST have ff.  Today was a must do ff for us bc of time. Grrrrrrr!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"BK: Are you checking up on your franchise holders? Probably the worst I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"1.5 average? Really? It's Burger King. In the back of O'Sheas. By the bathroom. C'mon guys... why the hate?  If you make it to this part of O'Sheas, you know, the back part with the beer pong tables and the Subway and the weird Taco place and the punching bag strength machine, what really are your expectations of a BK? What are you expecting that would warrant more than 2 stars? Complimentary champagne perhaps? Red carpets? Kim Kardashian behind the register?   I don't remember the last time I came to O'Sheas and made it to BK without being drunk. O'Sheas doesn't exactly carry the holier than thou attitude that most of the other bars and lounges on the strip do. So, most everyone here is drunk, almost drunk, hung over or drunk. Oh, and hungry. Enter this Burger King.  It's pretty cheap food. Considering how much the entrees are at Hash House a Go Go next door at Imperial Palace is, or the Cafe at Harrahs and Burger Joint at Flamingo (all within walking distance of O'Sheas and open late), the food here is a steal! We all know that, which is why we walk all the way to the back of O'Sheas to this place. It serves its exact purpose. Provide cheap, fast and greasy food. And for that, they should be admired not admonished.   So what if you get the runs the next day. It's probably from all the alcohol anyway. So what if the employees look like the \"after\" shots of Faces of Meth. So what if the food takes longer than registering your car at the DMV. It's vegas, relax."}
{"text":"The staff here must hate their job.   Edna the general manager appears lost and over whelmed with the duties.  The shop is dirty and they do not provide napkins with meals.  This will be short and sweet. Stay away and not worth your hassels here. P"}
{"text":"Worst experience in restaurant history!!!!!!! The cashier was rude, service was slow, drink machine completely empty. Who ever is running this place needs to be fired as well as all the employees. This Burger King needs to be closed permanently."}

{"text":"Burger King is a place where you can get fast food that sort of tastes ok, but then you feel pretty gross after eating.  But it's really cheap, so it has that going for it.  I actually really like the caramel frappé, which is pronounced [Fra-pey].  It's tasty, but more expensive than several items off the dollar menu (which means it costs over several dollars)."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru that I have ever been to. I have waited up to 3 minutes for them to answer the mic and today I have plenty of time to write this review while waiting.. And there is only 2 cars ahead of me."}
{"text":"This is \"THE WORST\" experience I ever had when it comes to Fast Food.My husband was craving for Burger King and what a mistake that was stopping at this location (2180 E Serene Ave Las Vegas NV 89123).I ordered through the Drive thru and I don't understand the fascination of this Fast food chain on rushing the line in Drive thru & yet it's either the order was wrong or just completely disgusting presentation of the food.After this experience this will be the last time that Burger King will get our Business.And I want everyone out there to know that this is just a bad business specially how competitive all this Fast food chains in Las Vegas.This is why the Chic Fil A will always be the best one because they seem to manage to keep their high quality standard.And any other Fast Food place out there are trying really hard to improve their Menu.And yet Burger King just don't care and I won't be surprise if this business will just go downhill one day.They gave me 2 BURNT CRISPY CHICKEN SANDWICH at this location & it's not even edible because it was so bitter.Whoever own this location should step up & see what's going on at this location."}
{"text":"I have never once in my life wrote a review in anything, especially if it's something negative. But today, i decided to go to Burger King on the way home to grab something to eat for my husband and I. As I get home my husbands asks if I'm eating, and than I realize they forgot to put my food in the bag. No problem, I work in retail so I figured I'll send my husband to pick up my food and at least get a refund on my meal for the inconvenience. Not the whole meal, just mine. So I call a first time to let them know hay they had forgotten to put my food in the bag to which they reply \"yes, I actually have it right here. Can you come by and pick it back up?\" To which I reply \"uh, yes that's fine\". Later on as my husband is on his way I decide to call to ask for the refund and notice that they hadn't even given me a receipt.. so of course when I call they say \" there isn't much I can do if you don't have your receipt or bring back the food.\" I thought I had explained myself wrong since the second phone call was not with the same lady so I repeat \" no you see I called back and they said that indeed they had forgotten to put my food in the bag and so I don't need a whole refund just on my meal\". To which she still replies \" im sorry I can't unless you don't want your sandwich back.....\". Ummmmm if I had accidentally led two thing out of your bag than out of good customer service I'm gonna do at least something for your inconvenience.. I didn't think asking for 8 dollars and something change back was that big of a deal. None the less, food is fine but I can't go to a place where the customer service sucks.. it would be going against everything I believe in when it comes to pleasing customers/ guests. Probably doesn't matter at all to them but I will NEVER be going there again and I advise you to visit any other of the fast food spots around the area!!"}
{"text":"Terrible drive thru service from older lady,1215 lunch on Monday cant give cost of meal, says come to 2nd window, cant reach out to give change,then forgets drink, napkins, ketchup. She cares less less about customer, your an inconvenience  for her."}
{"text":"I would give the place a zero if I could. This morning it took 25 minutes to get through the drive through. All I ordered was a breakfast burrito.  When I got back home and opened it up it was literally charburnt on one end. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"They messed up my order... And still get 5 stars the manager on staff is the definition of customer service... I have dined at 5 star resorts where the manager had no wheres near the kindness this manager showed me today... Russ was his name and he resolved my problems swiftly and professionally. Definately was worth my money and felt they actually wanted to earn it and not just treat me as an one customer in an asembly line of customers, i felt as if i actually have a voice in this little fast food place... Well done Russ!"}
{"text":"While looking for a place to eat at the airport late at night, we found many of them closed and so, decided on BK. The service was pretty fast. In fact, the lady at the counter offered to swap out fries for onion rings and soda for milk shake in my meal. I was about to order them separately but she suggested I order a meal and she could simply swap them and it would cost me a little less. Never heard of that one before. My chicken sandwich and onion rings were good. Well, four stars for the service. The food is pretty much the usual."}
{"text":"Holy god, this place is exactly why people balk when fast food workers ask for 15 dollars an hour. This place would run smoother if it were operated by trained monkeys. I can't wait until they automate these jobs with robots. I waited in the drive-thru for 20 minutes (I'm not sure why, should have driven away) behind only 2 cars. When I finally got to the window I found why. After sitting at the window for several more minutes, the guy gives me the total and I give him my card. Window closes and 5 more minutes go by. He opens the window and says he can't get my card to swipe. I tell him to type it in, that's why it has numbers on it. This seems to sail right over his head but because he's not sure how to respond he closes the window again. A few more minutes go by, he opens the window and says he still can't swipe it. I tell him again, just type it in man, I've done this job, just type it in, takes 5 seconds! He looks confused, window closes. Few more minutes pass, OMG! This is supposed to be FAST food, I want to drive away but the guy has my card still. Window opens. This time it's a manager and guess what? He can't swipe my card either. I tell him to type the number in, starting to feel like I'm taking crazy pills now. He says he can't because he might \"accidentally type it in wrong and charge the wrong person\". Something in me snaps and all politeness goes out the same window I'm staring at this guy through. I say \"so you think you're too incompetent to type in a number on a card, but also lucky enough to accidentally get another card number that's going to work?\". The blank stare I receive tells me that he stopped understanding what I was saying right before the word \"incompetent\" and doesn't understand how credit cards work. After a few awkward moments he just repeats that he can't get my card to swipe. At this point I gave up, demanded my card back, and drove across the street to Icebergs (where my card swiped just fine). This location is dead to me."}
{"text":"This is the closest Burger King to my house. I have been here maybe 3 times in 6 years and never has it ever had good service. The employees are rude and you're lucky to get an order right."}

{"text":"This is the worst Burger King I've ever been to. I waited at the order menu for 10 minutes only to have to wait at the window for another 15 minutes. The cashier was rude and didn't have any explanation about why the wait was so long. Meanwhile an employee was watching videos on his phone and the inside register. It definitely seemed like a lack of caring, not a service issue."}
{"text":"What you expect from a BK. Fast at lunch time. Friendly staff and have always honored coupons if I bring them without so much as an eyeroll."}
{"text":"I know 1 star is the lowest rating possible but in this case it seems like too much. Every time I've come to this location something has gone wrong, and I have been coming to this Burger King infrequently since before it was struck by lightening and  rebuilt. My most recent visit had me waiting in my hot car when it was 106 degrees outside for almost half an hour because the drive thru staff had me pull around to the front of the building and completely forgot about my order. The food was sitting out for who knows how long before I went in to get it myself. If you have a craving for Burger King do yourself a favor and pick another location. This one falls short of the standard."}
{"text":"Slowwwwwwwwwww  - I do not normally rate fast food places - you get what you pay for,  My experience at this Charlotte BK was nothing I have ever seen  1.  I ordered 2 combo meals - 25 MINUTES from order to food 2.  The manager did nothing to help get orders 3.  One of the cooks (sagging pants and all) was singing Usher songs  at the front counter instead of making food -  4.  Processed chicken strips do not do well when the sit for 25 minutes - they tasted like s*it. 5.  No thank you , sorry about the wait, here's a free _______ for the poor service  -   I would have gone somewhere else - but I was like whats the point - the food has to come eventually    STAY AWAY !"}

{"text":"Before our move to Vegas and the experience of eating a six dollar burger, the \"WHOPPER\" was the best burger we'd eat. Maybe it was a limited choice, but it was one we, my husband and I enjoyed regularly.   So going back to Burger King and trying the whopper after a few years of having skipped them, was a bit disappointing! I don't know if it was the late night order, we went around 8oclock at night, or they have lost some of their flavor.   The bun was dried out, the burger had no flavor, and the best thing about the meal was the french fries. I know that consistency plays a big role in any fast food place, but I don't know if I want to try again, I was that disappointed."}
{"text":"Friday night 10:00 PM: Told them THREE times at the drive through I wanted a Whopper Jr. WITH CHEESE, NO MAYO. I got a regular Whopper Jr. with no cheese, and slathered in mayo, of course.That's a pretty simple order, how is it so hard to understand? Why is EVERYONE who works in the food service industry on this side of town a complete moron?!? I mean, how stupid can you be? If you can't even get your fast food job right, do the world a favor & go play in traffic, you are of absolutely no use on Earth. Seriously, I HATE this part of town for this reason. I cannot get good food anywhere, from Burger King to Cheesecake Factory, incompetence abounds in the food service industry everywhere in the Summerlin area! And I thought this was the nice part of town!?!  *UPDATE*  My friend had to go back to the drive through for me & the young manager \"Brandon\" did have my Whopper Jr. re-made the correct way & also gave us 2 small fries & a piece of Hershey pie for free because of the hassel. Apparently it was the cook's fault. I would've given this review an extra star for Brandon's fairness, except when my friend got back he noticed that the sandwich he had originally ordered was wrong too & had mayo on it when he asked for no mayo on his chicken sandwich. Let's just say Brandon needs to run a tighter ship & make sure the employees at this location are doing their jobs correctly & making the orders right."}
{"text":"Ordering from a fast food place my expectations are not that high to begin with. But Burger King is just horrible. I'm not sure why I have tried so many different things on their menu and have kept going back because every time I end up not liking it. The only thing halfway decent is their onion rings with the zesty sauce. I got some weird burger that had barbecue sauce and onion rings and bacon on it, supposedly flame broiled. It had some weird fake  smoke flavor to it. Let's just say I think I have finally learned my lesson and will not be eating Burger King again."}
{"text":"The food was cold and I was cheated out of $10.00 at the window. I immediately brought it to the attention of the manager and in two minutes he said I was wrong. In those two minutes he said he counted the till. Sure a fast count. I will never return."}

We called the restaurant and politely asked for a refund. But they said we would have to bring the food in to show them. So instead I come to help to alert fellow yelpers not to eat at this Burger King. This is a new low for any fast food establishment. Despicable!"}

Every single time I have gone there they have screwed it up bad.  Poop food and service. Every single time I go there I vow not to ever go again."}
{"text":"This location's first and only review was almost three years ago and it was two stars. I would have hoped things have changed by now. They have not. I've made two visits to this location in the past two weeks. The first was a weekday around 1:30pm and the next was a Saturday at 7:30ish.  I wanted to chalk up my first visit as just a one-off; maybe the staff were just having a bad day. Even after what would be considered the the standard lunch rush time the place was still packed. It took me over 20 minutes to get my order. This was unacceptable. The staff were completely disorganized and many customers were visibly unhappy. The cashiers kept piling on the orders and the runners just couldn't keep up and got lost and confused.  My second visit was slightly better but it still took an oddly long time to get my food. There was only one order ahead of me. My issue upon my return visit was that the dining room was a mess. I couldn't find a clean table and there isn't a ton of seating to begin with for a location that's on a busy downtown corner.  The food quality is no better or worse than any other BK I've been to. Though BK changed their fries a few months ago I'm still hesitant to try them after the garbage they used to sell and call french fries.  If you're looking for a quick bite in this area you're probably better off going across the street and getting a hot dog from 7-Eleven."}
{"text":"Oh Burger King how I love thee, let me count the ways.  Ok, I don't like you that much, but you're a good choice when I'm craving a big greasy burger.  I'm annoyed at you though and you're not the only fast-food chain I'm annoyed at because you all claim to have a spicy, knock-your-socks-off burger.  You should really change the name of your Angry Whopper to \"Disgruntled Whopper\" or maybe \"Temper tantrum Whopper\" because the burger I had today definitely was not angry by any means.  There was barely any kick to the jalapenos or the spicy sauce which just really seemed like mayo and ketchup mixed together.  BRING ON THE HEAT!!! (please)"}
{"text":"Something's wrong with this picture. I can't quite put my finger on it. What is it?  This location is interesting. They have an upstairs dining area that I have never seen open. They have staff that don't seem to get along but are still very quick with getting the orders out. But most of all, it just doesn't have that burger King feeling.  Today I ordered a Whiplash Whopper. I think they name it so because you're going to get whiplash turning your head in every possible direction wondering where the spice is. Maybe it fell under the table? Nope. Maybe it's all stuck to the wrapper? Nope. Then the whiplash comes as you snap your head back in amazement realizing that the burger has no spice to it. Sure the advertising claims to have spicy mayo and pepper jack cheese, but this burger is about as spicy as a glass of milk.  At least the Angry Whopper had jalapeños.  Oh yeah, and that thing I couldn't quite put my finger on? It was that there was no music playing. Have you ever been to a fast food restaurant that doesn't have music playing in the background? Don't, it's creepy."}
{"text":"While I swore I'd never write up a fast food chain review, I have to give this location a nod, as it had no reviews, and frankly, it deserves the compliment.  Reason being?  I got very courteous, very polite, very efficient service.  The guy who was behind the drive-thru window this last Monday was as polite as he could be.  I don't know whether it was the result of a competent manager training program, or his momma simply raised him right, but I usually don't expect compliments when I get an average fast food burger.  Nice kid.  Plus, my order was completely 100% correct, and I simply have to make note of that.  While every experience down the road may not be as favorable or as agreeable as this one was,  you have to give credit where it's due."}
{"text":"I eat at this Burger King once every few years. It's actually within walking distance from my home it I'm ambitious, so you'd think I'd fall victim to this guilty pleasure a bit more often. From opening day, the attitudes of workers at this restaurant have always been negative. It's fascinating how a negative culture can be passed along through the years. I decided to try again, drawn in this time by advertising. Same result. They \"honored\" the $5 coupon by charging me $6.50. I casually pointed out the mistake only to be greeted by a firm \"$6.50.\" Then a firmer \"$6.50!\" Followed by a firmer \"$6.50!\" A refusal to explain was then followed up by ignoring me and taking a drive thru order. Hmm.  You won't find any old dudes meeting to enjoy their senior coffee or lots of kids dipping their French Toast sticks at this location. The dining room if often empty. This Burger King exists for its drive thru business. You will feel far from welcome if you venture inside. If you must, I suggest you go to a different Burger King."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have come to this location and they've messed up my order. I didn't check both bags until I got home and they forgot my nuggets! They gave me the sauce for them but didn't put them in the bag. Last time it was fries. It's not rocket science. The people who work here really struggle to do a basic job. Ugh."}
{"text":"Must be bad management.. Their equipment is aways borken down and I have had multiple orders with food so old I'm surprised they haven't gotten people sick. This was the last time I will ever go to this location."}
{"text":"i ordered 2 for $6 whoppers with no no no lettuce! i was assured they would make them fresh...drove to the window and went home. opened my burger...guess what? yep! tons of lettuce!  there are other bk's near here. don't waste your time on this one. nobody here cares!"}
{"text":"If i could give 0 stars, I would. We pulled up at 9:15pm on a Sunday. The doors were locked but the sign said open until 10:00pm. As we were walking to the car, the drive thru lights turned off. We followed another car through the drive thru but nobody attempted to take our orders so we decided to just drive through to leave. There was another car at the window and the driver said they're not closed. After 2 minutes of waiting, a worker came to the window and said their mic was down. (If their mic was down, wouldn't you want to keep the lobby open? Or put a sign at the drive thru? Let alone, keep your lights on?) So we waited for the lady in front to place her order. We were able to order but they clearly didn't care about how they served our food, literally just dumped in the bag. Anyways, as we drove off, we noticed their \"Drive Thru Open Late Sign\"... yeah okay.. they just wanted to close early and get away with it by saying their mic was broken. no excuses burger king! This rating is based solely on this single visit to burger king. Previous visits deserve 4 or even 5 star ratings."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Food was dry and hard..called manager and he was so rude (Lairmy-Larrysu) didn't get a receipt when i have been here many times before and always get receipt and one is always stickied to the bag. I wont be going again!!! Management needs to be given courtesy? class absolutely rude!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a looooong time. Used to come here with my mom as far back as I can remember. They still have the cartoons on the wall and the sunken dine it area. I hope it never changes. The food was great. Fresh, fast, served with a smile. They remembered everything as well (they even gave me extra sauce). 100% good experience, great place to be."}
{"text":"This is like one of the only Burger Kings I visited that I don't mind sitting down in to eat. The upkeep is pretty decent and I've only seen it not up to snuff a handful of times.   The food is always prepared the way you would expect it to be from a chain. I haven't had any issues with it thus far. I like this one. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"I have NEVER had trouble with BK except this one. If you are going in for a quick bite to eat, this is NOT the place. One time i went in and the woman said \" Hi can i help you, OH we dont have ANY meat today sorry.\" I thought she was joking and ordered a burger, and she was like \"No im serious, we have 0 meat, can i get you something to drink.\"   And yesterday , the ENTIRE parking lot was filled with people they asked to pull over for (Drive thru window) because it would take a minute for their food. I waited over 20 minutes for some buffalo strips? Avoid this BK at all costs! Nothing but trouble."}
{"text":"So.....I saw some construction going on near Walmart awhile back.  I was hoping that it would be a good restaurant.  Nope...Burger King.  I mean, we don't have a Burger King close to us, but I would have much preferred something good like an In N Out or something.  Oh well.    I was driving home from work the other night, and I hadn't been to a Burger King in years.  I decided to stop in and check out this brand new one.  I placed my order for a double cheeseburger, a rodeo burger, and a value sized onion rings.  Here is how they were..........  Double Cheeseburger-  Dang...super small!  I don't mind a small double cheeseburger ( example: Wendy's Double Stack) as long as it tastes good.  This one, not so much.  The cheese wasn't melted and the bun was a little bit too firm.  The meat did have the \"signature\" flame broiled taste, but it was skimp and the burger did not satisfy me at all.  Wouldn't get it again.  Prefer all other fast food restaurants double cheeseburgers over this one.  Rodeo Burger-  This thing was surprisingly decent.  It is a plain hamburger with bbq sauce and 3 onion rings.  It was much better than the double cheeseburger, and was well worth the $1.00.  It was actually one of the best $1.00 value meal burgers I have had from anywhere...not just BK.  I would get it again (might be the only thing I get ever again from BK).  Onion Rings-  I got the value size because it was the only size under $2.00.  I used to like BK's onion rings way back in the day.  I pulled out my \"bag\" of onion rings and was sadly disappointed.  6 onion rings in a \"value\" size.  That is like $.30 cents a ring.  Come on now...the rings tasted alright but it was almost a joke that they only give you 6.  You might as well order 2 rodeo burgers with no sauce, JUST for the onion ring portion.  You would get a bonus bun and burger lol.  Horrible value for the $1.69 or whatever they were.    Overall, it was meh.  I just don't really like Burger King, I guess. The rodeo burger was ok, but the double cheeseburger and the skimp onion rings were a total waste of money.  Service was fast and friendly, but I can't see myself heading back here on my own.  If my wife/kid wanted to go, I would get a couple rodeo burgers and that's about it.  2 stars...  Meh.  I've experienced better."}
{"text":"I'm not one to post a bad review without reason, but this is my second time visting this burger king and every time, they are \"closed \" yet the hours say midnight... It's 10 pm..."}
{"text":"Manager was bickering about how he's suppose to charge me 25 cents per sauce, so when I ended up offering to pay for it, he didn't want to take my money. Lower your confidence sir, you're just a manager at BK"}
{"text":"The service is always slow. Staff needs to be retrained. I can not stand going to tgis location. They either do not have ice cream or the icee machine is down. Drive-thru is almost always a bad experience here."}
{"text":"On the drive up menu the Texas Double Whopper, sandwich only is $6.99. When I gave my order I was told the total is $8.39 (the cents could be off a little). That's a lot of tax I told him and stated the price in the menu. His explanation was the price went up to compensate for increased minimum wages. Fine. Just don't advertise one price and charge much more! This was in January, 2018. Again in March or so I went there again and the drive up menu STILL showed $6.99. This time I talked to the manager who gave me a big discount. Now today (May 17) I go there AND IT IS STILL $6.99!!! This time the young lady was very rude and said (paraphrasing) \"I don't know sir. It's just $8.39, in a very put out time of voice.   So double check that you are only charged what the menu shows!!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually dislike burger king but when you are desperate and do not want to spend 25 bucks at a more expensive place in the airport this seems like a best bet. The burgers were not dry... the fries were fresh out of the fryer and crispy outside soft inside... boyfriend left and came back within 10 minutes... no gurgling upset stomach during the flight.. I guess we lucked out."}
{"text":"Dont try the buffalo chix strips, they tasted horrible and over cooked, the buffalo sauce tasted like vinegar straight out of the bottle. i paid over $10 for the \"meal\""}
{"text":"Famished and stopped in for a late lunch (2pm), I had been craving a burger (didn't have to be a gourmet one) since yesterday.  Today I decided I needed something quick and easy, Jr. Whopper meal it is.   For $5 I got my burger and fry fix.  Fresh, simple I was out of there in less than 15 minutes.   The employees were very nice and the place was clean.    Sure I have 5 Guys just about the same distance away, but I wasn't impressed and I get my fix on the cheap here."}
{"text":"We visited this joint on a trip to the outlet mall and while it's pretty standard food court fare... it's really just pretty standard food court fare, honestly. The place isn't bad, but it's hard to find good court locations that can compare to standalone restaurants. If you're at the outlets, then it'll work, but there's a full-size Burger King just up the road that's grand, as well."}
{"text":"We came in for the special on chicken nuggets, and found this location to be exceptionally friendly, quick and proficient, and the food was hot and delicious. Our orders were ready each time before the next person in our group finished ordering. The nuggets were flavorful and not overdry; the fries were crisp. They have the fancy programmable Coke machine, so cherry vanilla Mello Yello is a true possibility. Brandon was the name of the young man that helped us, answered our questions, took our orders and brought us our requested sauces. Definitely going to be back."}
{"text":"Good service & always clean. I would recommend this location. The employees are friendly and get your food out quickly."}
{"text":"I pulled up in the drive-through, said hello twice, and waited a couple minutes before a man said \"yeah, what do you want?\". He got my 3 item order wrong and had to be corrected. When I pulled up to pay he stuck his hand out the window and told me to stop before I was at the window. He was clearly taking the order of the person begging me. Once he was done with that he signaled to me to pull ahead. I worked in fast food long enough to know that he was trying to keep his timer down, but this was extremely rude and unnecessary. He was not friendly at the window either and the food was cold."}
{"text":"People, this is an AIRPORT food place, so YES IT WILL BE MORE PRICEY THAN YOUR LOCAL CORNER fast food place. This should be expected when you're eating at the airport.   I needed to get lunch, and yelped a few places in terminal 3, and none had good reviews. What I looked for in reviews was Bad food, poisoning or stomach issues, and burger king didn't have any of those bad reviews, so I decided to give it a try.   Cashier was just fine... She's just doing her job, as a cashier in an airport fast food place, give her a break. Imagine how many people are complaining to her about the prices, and obviously she does not have anything to do with it.   My Whopper was served fast and tasted very good. Fries was good too, which is often a gamble with fast food places.   I approve this place... Better than buying a cold cardboard tasting sandwich for $10 at any other food shops in terminal 3."}
{"text":"Stopped at this location for breakfast after a barrage of commercials on the Ion channel during a Criminal Minds marathon! The kids wanted sausage biscuits. The drive thru girl informed us that they were out of sausage biscuits. We adjusted our order. They overcharged for he 2 for $4 special. They also made us pull to the front to wait for our food. Almost 10 minuted for our order and by the time the runner brought it to the car, everything was cold. Wholly unimpressed. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Terrible location, terrible service, terrible new less fat fries, terrible in/out location. I stopped here after making a delivery. I was very hungry and thirsty. I decided to try the new fries and asked for a large glass of ice. I was charged the full price of a drink for just the ice. I wish I just grabbed a plastic bag, dumped the ice in it, and returned the cup. The water - NASTY. I'm not sure what was going on with it but it tasted terrible. As did the fries. They tasted more like chemical mixtures than potatoes. The entrance/exit placement made it nearly impossible to continue on my route without an illegal left hand turn or a U-turn later down the road."}
{"text":"I brought my boys here about six months ago for a breakfast burrito while our tires were being rotated across the street. We were the only people there at the time with one person going through the drive through and waited 18 minutes for our two burritos so I complained and they gave me a coupon for for free whopper. I realized it was expiring so we used it today. We went through the drive through with no one in front of us and when I was pulled up to the window, I could see no one at the counter and the restaurant looked empty. It took close to ten minutes for my free whopper and a small order of fries. I have no idea why this location is so ridiculously slow but this will be my last time here."}
{"text":"As a treat for my sweet pea we stopped here on the way to cub scouts last week.  Well, I won't lie.  I was also craving a garden burger.  We got there and the man taking our order was very nice but while there was only one other customer in the restaurant, it took us 18 minutes to get our food.  That's just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Never had a problem with it... I like their chicken nuggets as well as their breakfast menu is pretty good. However, if u order it with no bun, chances are they will not put anything else on it besides meat and cheese and veggies. Even if you do ask for it. So minus a star for that."}
{"text":"not sure what's up with the low reviews. This is probably the one I go to the most... right off the light rail, and have always gotten good service. They have great chicken nuggets... 10 for $1.50. Can't beat that. Get a honey mustard and a BBQ sauce and you're good to go. They have good ice cream sundaes, and I love their soda machine... you pick a base soda or water and then the flavor. Vanilla sprite for the win. I'll be back the next time the desire for chicken nuggets arises."}
{"text":"This place gets worse and worse every time I come. If the soda machine isn't broken, then the credit card machine is down. The drive thru lane takes much longer than it ever should. They may have given the outside a face lift but I haven't had a pleasant experience since. Avoid this location if you can."}
{"text":"Ordered a large fry half way filled if that. I also ordered two kids meals. Chicken nuggets asked do you want sauce yes bbq please get all the way home give the kids food and guess what no bbq. Oh and i brought the large fry back inside in my hand no bag the manager took it over the counter and topped it off."}
{"text":"This location is very hit or miss, sometimes its inedible and sometimes its surprisingly good. Some of the workers seem to be very nice and attentive to their job and others seem like they shouldn't be in the food industry. Wish I could give 2 and a half stars."}
{"text":"It's a Burger King like any other.  I prefer their reheated \"flame broiled\" burgers over McD's.  It's serves it's purpose and it's on our way from Big League Dreams to the US60."}
{"text":"Kinda scary.. Their dinning room is way outdated. Did the wrong thing in spending all their money on one of those new fancy soda machines, that's the only thing new in there in 20 years. This bk makes me think I'm in the ghetto."}
{"text":"I stopped at this place because I wanted breakfast and it was the closest and only breakfast place open. I haven't been to a Burger King in months. The people behind the counter were actually nice. I ordered a meal that was $5.99 and I asked for a small drink instead of coffee, this added .99 to the order...WOW! That's pricey. Then I looked at my receipt and it said my meal was $6.29. I just want people to check their receipts as they are overcharging people and most never check their receipts. The only reason I give this rip off place a 2 star is because the employees were really nice."}
{"text":"Just wasted over half of my lunch break waiting in line, paid $8 for a chicken sandwich meal and the thing wasn't even cooked!! Couldn't go back because I had to get back to work. Absolutely ridiculous!! Never again!"}
{"text":"The stores is in the Plum Turnpike service plaza with seating in the food court.its nice to have a choice between the convenience store sandwiches. It's your normal Burger King menu and they were fast and efficient. The food courts clean and so are the restrooms."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken sandwich, they asked if I wanted cheese so I said sure.  They charged me extra for the cheese and then when I got my sandwich there was no cheese at all on it.  THEN I wanted a diet coke with my meal and they give it me. It tasted awful!  I asked the lady at the window if this was diet coke she gave me and she yes and disappeared before I could tell her it was bad.  I had to pull around front and wait because my food wasn't ready.  When she finally brought me the food, I told her she might want to check their diet coke because it tastes awful and she said \"yeah they just told me\" and walked off.  No \"do you need another drink\" or \"can get you something different.\" Nope, just left me with a gross diet coke that would go straight in the garbage and charged me for cheese that they didn't add.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Ya Im giving 5 stars to a fast food place. Ive been going to this burger king forever since it is convienently right down the road from where I live. I have always had exceptional customer service there. That is my honest reason for the 5 stars. I would have probably never wrote a review for this place except for last week it was late and I was going through the drive thru for some quick burgers. The place is being remodeled so you cant go in but the drive thru was open. They had a new employee working that night. Not sure of his name but the kid with the braces gave me better customer service than I have recieved in most actual restaurants. Smily and friendly. He really stood out. That being said it made me realize that all the employees I have came in contact with there have been exceptionally nice.I have been there when they experienced thier debit machine going down and after waiting in the drive thru forever they gave me my food for free and apologized. Kudos to this location on customer service!  I suggest the double cheeseburger btw! :)"}
{"text":"Worst place dirty and they don't listen and just key in whatever they want. Screwed up our entire order then blamed me for their mistakes. Asked for one thing got another thing and to top it off they were like oh I only charged you for what we gave you not what you asked for. They tried to make it like it was my fault. I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Burger King that I have ate at. The restaurant was dirty and the employees were so engaged with each other, that no one took our order. There was ketchup stuck to the straws. Also the drink station looked it had not been cleaned all night. While the employees are behind the register constantly talking about customers and how they respond to their food cooking. I will never come back to here to eat."}
{"text":"Same experience as before. The store could have been much cleaner and the service better. There was a male employee training a female employee and neither of them spoke good English, which seriously slowed down the order line. There were male employees behind the counter grabbing and flirting with each other, not even bothering to say anything or make eye contact as they served customers' food.  As a positive, the food was fresh."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and my food is always done to my request and In a timely matter, but why is the milkshake machine always \"down for cleaning\". I just want a strawberry milkshake man !"}
{"text":"Yes, it's burger king, what's worse is the smell that never seems to leave the area where you pick up your food and where you get your drinks. For years it has smelled like someone threw up."}
{"text":"Unacceptable. Go through the drive thru right. And their coms are down. So I place my order at the window and offer to pull around while they make the order did that they can ring up customers behind me. Asst. Manager asks mr to pull around, says it'll be only a few minutes. Over 15 minutes later he comes out. Annoyed already but still polite, I take the food and drinks and head home to enjoy my 1 night off all week. Get home and my bacon cheese chicken sandwich is missing the bacon and the cheese. Are you kidding? So I proceed to call the location, still in a semi-ok mood though again, annoyed because i literally get 1 night off and now have to go all the way back to fix my food... but here I'm thinning if i call ahead, they'll be able to have it ready so i can just swing in. Nope, no one answers the phone and i tried like 12 times on my way back. I walk in and am told it'll take another 10 minutes at least. Jesus f*ing christ. I've now wasted over 40 minutes, to include drive time of what fragile and very limited time i get to spend freely. Side note, they even tell you they don't answer the phone... lovely!  I am not typically an angry person and I don't appreciate expressing such negativity.  I do appreciate and thank the asst. Manager for fixing the issue and sending me on my way with a couple desserts. I also apologize for my behavior. I would call him and apologize directly but they don't answer the phones."}
{"text":"I have had two great experiences here and I found a perfect little burger if you are watching calories. Order the double meat hamburger and it's under $2 and only 300 calories. The burger is way better than McDonalds. Fast and friendly service, and my order was perfect."}
{"text":"I found a perfect little burger here if you are watching calories. Order the double meat hamburger and it's under $2 and only 300 calories. The burger is way better than McDonalds and the service here was great. Fast and friendly and my order was perfect."}
{"text":"Took ten minutes to get my food and I had to remind them what size I ordered.  Multiple people were complaining how long their order was taking (course, they waited until after I ordered to start complaining).  This is a privately owned franchise, prices are high and no specials.  The whole outside of the building is under construction at the moment."}
{"text":"I needed a quick dinner in during my stopover so I raced to my usual fast food at McCarran.  I ordered the Whopper Jr combo ($8), of which is the most inexpensive combo meal available.  = HIGHWAY ROBBERY....."}
{"text":"I love Burger King but I would drive five extra miles to avoid this location. I think the government owns this location because they work at DMV speed not In-n-out speed. One double cheese burger with no modifications took 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I haven't been to any Burger King since I went to this location, the burger I got not only looked disgusting but tasted horrible to the point I couldn't eat it and threw it away. I still can't consider eating their food."}
{"text":"Broiler always \"Breaks down\" anytime it's within an hour of closing. Lazy employees that take forever and have no customer service. Yet they want $15 an hour lol."}
{"text":"This location doesn't even deserve ONE star!  Consistently mess up my simple order. Fries are generally cold. When I order a whopper with ketchup ONLY, I'm asked if I want cheese on it. Nope, hence ketchup only. The carbonated beverages taste awful also. Too much water and very little carbonation. Icing on the cake - the employees aren't very friendly and the drive thru makes fast food look like dine-in when it comes to wait times."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would. I ordered only 2 whoppers and chicken fries and I shouldn't have had to wait 15 minutes. They said to pull around front and this is the longest I ever had to wait. And I think with how long I had to wait maybe it would be fresh but nope everything is cold. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Home sick and sent my son to get 6 chicken sandwiches with cheese and mayo only.  No one there spoke English, and my son came home with 6 sandwiches with lettuce and light mayo.  So both kids went back out to go fix it as none of us like lettuce. She talked to a girl and told her cheese and mayo only, girl said she would fix them all.  They get home and guess what....6 sandwiches with TONS of lettuce and cheese and mayo!   Come on now!! Tried calling this location after the first time there was a mix up and phone is busy. When we tried calling again, phone is still busy. Probably called like 20x.   This place needs to get it together!!"}
{"text":"Thee worst BK I have ever been to!!  The burger was so over cooked that it tasted like the smell of cow manure!!... I couldn't even dare finish my burger."}
{"text":"There was mold on my breakfast sandwich bread. It also took a while to get the attention of the workers who were all in the back. It wasn't me either. I also saw other people yelling \"Hello?!\" while waiting in front of the cash register and no one would respond. Eventually a cashier would show up to help, but the mannerism of not acknowledging that they had heard someone ask for assistance is a bit odd."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab something quick on my way to work my order was complicated and they got it right lol I was super suprised but any who get job guys...."}
{"text":"My 2-year-old was almost going to dance on the tables! This location sports about 25-30 parking spots. The service is courteous and respectful. Our takeout was delivered about 2 minutes from ordering, and we came in at lunch hour on a Saturday - it was a consistent and steady speed coming from the kitchen. Food was just the right temp (not burnt, but not undercooked). I'm glad to see about 3-4 families here each time dining with their young children. Even though there is no play area facility, my kiddos still enjoy coming here for the food. There are about 7 family-sized seating booths, and 2 couples booths. The remaining consist of 1 family high-table, and 7 family tables. To our liking, condiments are given in individual sized packets, not the self-serve pumps. Yes we are wierd like that :)"}
{"text":"Have been there multiple times thanks to the close proximity but this morning was not a great experience.  I've never noticed anything standing out good or bad.  However, this morning we went to go get breakfast and the lady  took quite awhile to take our order, we were the only ones there it was about 8:30amish and she ignored us.  When she did take the first order she didn't know the menu or pricing.  And her attitude was not pleasant.  She took the order and as soon as she did walked away.  I still had to order and she was gone so quickly I couldnt even call her back.  She eventually came back and got my order and was not friendly which was fine but she talked with rudeness in her voice and did not seem like she wanted to be there.  The service is usually okayish but today is was repulsive.  There food is sometimes over salted which I suppose is expected at fast food places once in a while."}
{"text":"Not a good place to go manager sucks  My godson was trying to decide on his order and she was very rude about it. Plz go To another place before you go here, MAKE THIS YOUR LAST STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Every now and then I just get a hankerin for a whopper, happened to be out running errands and grabbed myself a sandwich through the drive thru.  Staff was super friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I am surprised of so many negative reviews this is actually one of the better Burger King I've been to the food is normally hot and the customer service is actually really better then most Burger King's I've been to I come here regularly normally in the morning time."}
{"text":"My order is always perfect and fast in the drive through. Took only 5 minutes and my order was just how I like it  ...no ketchup on burger and fries are always perfectly crispy and warm (unlike Wen and Harv who take forever and foods never right)  I asked about 'Whopper Wednesday' and got a combo for just $6 and change. I was so full and couldn't finish the burger but it was great!"}
{"text":"Along the lines of the old \" if a tree falls in the forest, does anybody hear?\"....  Would I have been craving my long-ago usual: \" double cheeseburger plain, onion rings, Diet Coke, of course\" if I didn't lay eyes upon this new \"Home of the Whopper\"?   I doubt I would've. It's been a long time! And that \"usual\" was still quite satisfactory. And the drive-through employee was so nice, and my onion rings so fresh...that I even awarded them the extra star as a thank-you and \"welcome to the neighborhood!\"   Now there are the three biggies up this way: Mc'Ds and In-n-Out off the Carefree Hwy/I-17 exit and this BK off the fairly new Dove Valley exit. If you want to deal with a little less traffic/lines...BK is the way to go (for now.) (and yes, there's a BK down Carefree Hwy east, a couple miles.)  If a burger sizzles on the flame broiler in the desert....does anybody hear? I hear and I obey.   To-go, order up!  Let's see when I'm tempted again....  To be continued"}
{"text":"Yes, it's Burger King and yes, I went through the drive thru.  However, unfortunately like other Burger King locations this was underwhelming. The Drive Thru took over 20 minutes to order and when I finally received my order it was wrong. Cold Burger, Burnt Fries, ugh! Definitely wouldn't return to this location."}
{"text":"I recently went to this Burger King to acquire about  the new crispy chicken sandwich and when I approached the voice box I was greeted by a rude employee who's first words were \"we do have any ice..\" I continued with my order and did not here a response which prompted me to ask the employee did she hear me. She responded in a rude tone asking me \"Did you hear me\". I was taken back by such a rude response I decided to leave the Burger King telling the employee \"have a good night\" when she rudely cut me off and began to say \"yes, yes\" worst experience ever!! Bad attitudes and what fast food chain runs out of ice."}
{"text":"It's a fairly decent BK location, considering. There were a few people loitering around the front entrace, asking me for money. One of them was somewhat belligerent.  The cashiers were fast and friendly and my order was hot and fresh. I commented on the three men outside. But the cashier shrugged and said that the cops chase them away almost every day.   I wouldn't recommend going there at night."}
{"text":"Once in a while I like to eat at Burger King, but this location need some serious customers service. The lady at the Drive Thru she is really rude."}
{"text":"My son loves your chicken sandwich so you get three stars.  My last two experiences at your restaurant though were not good. My food was old ,  Luke warm and rubbery , the restaurant was dirty and the help acted like they could care less.  I have always loved Burger King but you guys need to put more effort into this place. It's like no one cares too much. I'd hate to see this Burger King go down hill. The one near south hills village already closed."}
{"text":"Very rude customer service on friendly staff and that's why I left did not even get my food this Burger King is ridiculous"}
{"text":"We did a drive thru after the movies on our way home. Was super weird, I ordered our food they didnt tell us the price til we got to the window. I get to the window they take my cash tell me to pull up while no one behind us. So we pull forward waiting for a good 2 minutes two girls bring our bag of food with our two milkshakes with no one else coming thru the drive thru so whyd you have us pull up?  We start driving out and see our fries were super soggy and under cooked, we ordered the meal with the 10 nuggets they gave us both old chicken fingers, we asked for ranch and bbq sauce and got two things of Buffalo sauce!   Really the worst fast food experience in years!  Look at my reviews, I don't give low scores often, this was horrible. Check your food before leaving or go inside. These girls had no care for customer service!"}
{"text":"This store is a joke. They take forever to say anything when u pull up to the drive through window. Once I pull up and pay the guy asks me to pull forward and wait for food to be brought out... It's 12:15am and there aren't any cars behind me. So I wait. Then some random kid with no uniform on opens the window and asks me again . I tell him there aren't any cars behind me and I'll just wait there... 5 minutes later, the first guy who now looks angry, squeezes my food out of his barely open window. I was still the only car in the drive through lane. Why would they want me to pull forward? Management is garbage. The worst I've ever seen. This store needs to close down. I'll never go there again. Once I got home, I closely searched my food for spit or missing items and I found this..."}
{"text":"The only redeeming quality for this location was the person taking the orders- lunch today had us waiting 20 minutes for a cheeseburger and onion rings. The lobby had only two other people waiting and another walks in- one of the cooks in the back screams at the cashier to not ring any more orders until they have caught up???!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sad excuses of a \"Mushroom and Swiss King\" burger...the picture says it all... i am still waiting for the mushrooms!!"}
{"text":"Went on New Year's Day to pick up a quick lunch while cooking a large dinner for friends and family. I went through the drive through. Almost nobody there, only one car ahead of me and I was #40 0n my receipt so I know the people working there had plenty of time to get me food done well. I was treated politely and got my food quickly as expected. When I got home and opened the bag is when my expectations were not met. Very poor food quality. Dry chicken sandwich, wilted lettuce, no condiments. Squished Whopper and cold fries. It looked as if they were down to the last buns in the bottom of the box because both sandwiches were flattened. Either that or someone purposely squished them flat. Then they were wrapped and served with old cold fries. Not worth the money for such bad food. Don't make the mistake of coming here, do yourself a favor and go down the street to In-and-Out for a good burger."}
{"text":"I never had a problem with this place until today. The drive thru attendant, Vanessa, was so rude. Aside from asking me what I wanted when I ordered, she didn't say another word. Yes, you're morbidly obese and have a mediocre job, but that's not my fault. The reason I took off 2 stars was for Jabba's piss poor attitude and the fact that my croissanwiches have been poorly prepared on more than one occasion."}
{"text":"I have come here from time to time .   My experience here is always good  and I make sure to come when there is no line or  less than five people in line so I do not have to wait .  I like the 2 for 7$ where you can select any two from  a whopper, chicken or filet for a fixed  price.    The fries are quite  good and I recommend going with fries no salt to keep the calories on the lower side.  Apple Turnovers are another one of my favourites with a soft crispy outside and a soft and sweet inside.  I will be back  from time to time  to try other items such as chicken fries, onion rings, or poutine as the length of the line at the  food court usually determines where I will order from ."}
{"text":"I come to this location every so often, and have recently been coming here every day for the fruit loops shake. I was waiting in line earlier today for a while in the drive thru, and when we reached the window to pay, the manager told us that we had been waiting a while so the shake was free!  I thought that was really awesome, considering that they consistently produce a good product at this location compared to other BKs.  I am a customer for life here!"}
{"text":"Put hands in the slushies when it overflowed. Messed up order twice (still got it wrong in the end) lady yelled at me for her mistake. Laughable it was SO so bad. You get what you pay for but the costumer service couldn't have been worse- SO RUDE and our entire order was wrong. Awful"}
{"text":"What the heck is going on with Burger King. Double whooper w/cheese combo meal....$940.are the f'n crazy. There are places here in town I can get a steak dinner for that much. Plus the service is lowsy. Been there twiice in  1 week, no napkins either time. GO TO HELL BURGER KING. YOU HAVE LOST ME."}
{"text":"They will make you eight minutes late for work when you got there five minutes before work and work is a block away and all you ordered was two chicken sandwiches and you're the only one in line at 10:25 pm on a Thursday and they smile in your face as they do it. Never again. I shouldn't be surprised though. The town motto of Avon is \"Wait, what? I have to work to make money? Pssshht, yeah right.\""}
{"text":"Guys, it's a Burger King.  If this is too expensive for you, please just grill your own burgers at home or buy a little deep fryer and make your own fries/chicken strips."}
{"text":"Who cares if they really do microwave their burgers?  They taste good.  And who cares if their chicken tenders are made from leftover chicken gizzards?  They taste good.  That should be their motto, \"Burger King: we're good at turning sh*t into tastiness\""}
{"text":"It's a Burger King, same as most.  This one is open 24 hours though.  I have not been inside, only the drive thru at weird hours of the night.  They always get my order right and the food is always fresh.  Other than that, it's the same as any other Burger King."}
{"text":"RUDE- Food is taste like its been sitting there. Ask for my burger off the broiler and they get an attitude and tell me to pull around that it will take 5mins. Onion rings are hard and chewy. They just need to knock this place down and put a Chick-fil-A  At least they always have a smile on there face and there food is good. WORST BURGER KING IN TEMPE."}
{"text":"Yes, its add to my donk, junky fast food, but it makes me the happiest girl in the world... until after I've finished eating it.  When I wan't to zonk out and not by means of alcohol, I go here, and order a Whopper or Whopper Jr. w/ cheese no pickles and no onions. On comes the beef induced 4-6 hour coma...yes, I don't process meat (intolerant to pork, so we don't eat bacon or sausage!) too well, and I'm not a fan of chicken in general, and their fish sandwich, its not bad, but I'm into the fresh out of the water type fishes. BK fries aren't really all that bad, but if I'm just getting fries, you'll find me at the McD down the street.  Haven't dined-in at this location in many many years, so I have no clue what the interior even looks like anymore. Drive thru is simplest. That way, I can take my artery clogging meal home to eat, where I'm close to my comfy bed."}
{"text":"It was okay. The server at the counter was good though! He made sure that we got what we came for!"}
{"text":"Not the friendliest crew. Came here to get something quick for the kids. Ordered 3 things. Took 25 min just to get our food. The worst part, there was NO thank you, NO please come again, NO sorry for the wait. There was only Heres your food, what else. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Customer service was great the food had been prepared before hand so it was saturated with grease"}
{"text":"Have it your way, like back in the day.  I can't tell you the last time I went to a BK and the cashier asked me what I wanted on my Whopper, but the super nice cashier at this Burger King did.  Softspoken and pleasant, Francine is exactly the type of employee I'd want if I ran a fast food place.  She has to deal with surly tourists and travelers all day long but she had a smile on her face and she is genuinely great at what she does.  The food took awhile but my Whopper was appealingly prepared (the way I wanted it...no pickles or onions!) and the fries were hot and crisp.    What more can you ask for?  Big shout out to my gal Francine.  If you're passing through LAS, stop by and say hello."}
{"text":"It's a Burger King.  The service was pretty quick and efficient.  The counter was a little messy...would have been  nice if it looked cleaner.   My burger was fine so I would say this place is okay."}
{"text":"Since this place is near my work, I enjoy it. The employees are friendly. It wasn't busy when I went and they are very courteous. I recommend this place if you're ever near and want to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled burger and after a 10 minute wait (oh btw I was the only one at there) I got a perfectly charred burger. I'm pretty sure they forgot the patty was sitting on the grill for that long."}
{"text":"Never had a problem with this Burger King. Been here plenty of times. Always meet with kind people and wonderful service. 5 Star Review 7-7-2017  The new Double Sourdough King burger we just bought was pretty garbage. For a $7+ burger you could at least have the sauce on the whole bottom bun. Pretty bland. Jack in the Box's SourDough Jack is infinitely better and better priced. Not sure if I will be back. Spent $17 on food (with a coupon deal) and ultimately was disappointed in the food. Also never got a receipt. Just stick with the dollar menu. Nothing else is worth the price you pay. Updated from 5 Star to 2 Star 4-8-1018"}
{"text":"Greasy goodness. Alex was very nice and got my food fast and everything correct. It is definitely in a shady part but if that doesn't bother you i would stop by. Try the bacon king jr but ask for light mayo.  Staff is nice, food and good and greasy, restaurant is clean. Thanks guys !"}
{"text":"Went to Burger King to grab something to eat after my day at the pool and wanted to eat something before to work. Thought it will be quick to order and get the food. All I can say it's HELL NO so wrong. Took me 20 min to get my food from the time I ordered. The lady didn't looks like she enjoyed her work or maybe she just tired?  However you hungry? Get ready to wait"}
{"text":"Yes they are ridiculously expensive compared to other BK's, but it is in the airport, what did you expect? Compared to some of the crap that you get prepackaged in the refrigerated cases, I welcome BK any time, vs an old tuna sandwich.  Service during breakfast was ridiculously quick.  I got my breakfast sandwich less than 2 min from the time I placed my order."}
{"text":"Worst staff ever. Would not give reciept. Swearing in front of customers. More worried about sexually harassing each other than paying attention to customers. Out of multiple menu items.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"This is the nearest Burger King near my house, and I really don't go here more often than I should because, well, I don't really fancy fast food places like this. I just happened to drop in here because I had my daughter with me & I wanted her to play at their little indoor playground after we ate lunch (it was getting too hot outside to head to the park).   Anyway, I ordered the Angry Whopper combo meal because it looked delicious and it was. I just didn't end up finishing it because it was just too big for me. I guess my eyes were hungrier than my tummy. My daughter got their two chicken strip kids meal with the fries, and she loved it.   What really fascinated me about this place was they had that cool Coca-Cola touch-screen vending machine! That was definitely fun to play around with. There were soooo many choices too! I would go back there just to see what else they had!  Overall, clean establishment, nice staff. It's Burger King, so there wasn't really a \"wow\" factor this place other than it being, well.. A Burger King."}
{"text":"I don't eat at Burger King Very often, however in last couple of months I have been to a few due to traveling more frequently. With that this location was definitely the cleanest I have experienced. The staff there was very friendly. I had inter action Mindy, Tammy, Tai, Ryisha and Mya. They were all friendly and still had time to small talk to my family and myself even though they were busy. The food was hot, fresh and delicious. The interior and exterior was very clean. Since I do visit Vegas frequently I will definitely make this a family spot to come by and eat. Thank you Burger Kind staff for showing me a different outlook on Burger King in general. In addition it was great to see a staff that was friendly and worked together so well, they all seemed to be happy employees to kudos to the managers that are running this location as well."}
{"text":"Really awful Burger King. I don't have particularly high expectations of fast food establishments off of highway exits, but this placed failed to meet even those. The bathroom is a single occupant facility, which is crazy, considering its highway proximity. The bathroom was fairly clean, but the soap dispenser and paper towel dispenser did not work.   The drink bar was covered in trash. Like actually covered in trash. Lids, straw wrappers, and napkins were everywhere, probably because the closest waste bin was across the dining room. That waste bin was overflowing, with trash piled up on the tray return.   The veggie burger was too tough to chew in places, but otherwise edible. The other food was fine, hot and ready quickly - what I would expect from \"fast food\".   The employee who rang us up was personable and accurate. Definitely the only redeeming part of the stop."}
{"text":"$5 for two small scoops of ice cream at Max Brenner's to go counter or... a $.96 (including tax) decent sized soft serve cone at O'Shea's Burger King... ummmmmmmmm obviously Burger King wins. If you're looking for the cheapest option on the Strip, this is it.   I went here on 4/29/11 with my coworker Kyle on our break. Usually, I wouldn't go in to O'Shea's because it's a hole... but Kyle's 6'5 and could probably kill people with his eyes, so I felt safe going in here. Service was fast and between the 10 lbs of food he bought, and the cone I bought (I felt like a jerk using my debt card for $.96 cents) it's the best bang for your buck on the Strip.   Be forewarned, there's literally no cell service here so you're SOL if you lose your group or they're drunk in the casino looking for you in the food court."}
{"text":"7/2/16 130pm. To the jerk who yelled at my pregnant wife because you couldn't find her car in the parking lot.  Next time bozo, if you are going to tell someone to park because you are not fast enough, keep track of the model of the car! Everytime we come here, we have to go park in the parking lot.  When there are 3-4 cars waiting, she doesn't know which one is for her so she sat and wait...and you had to ball to yell at her?"}
{"text":"I used to be a Whopper Wednesday customer, but it's been a while since they had this so I thought I'd give the 2 for $7 mix and match special a try. Drove though, the speaker was incredibly loud and the woman on the other end just wanted to get the order and was clearly getting short with me reading the menu and asking for a min. I finally decided on a Whopper and Chicken sandwich.  I started with the chicken sandwich, which was cold and considerably smaller than the whopper (and small than I remember it as well). It was slapped together with all the mayo on one side of the sandwich and nothing on the other, I ate what I could by biting off a bit from each side to get a balanced taste....uhgh, no go and tossed it into the trash.  Next, the Whopper, it was better, warm and put together with some degree of care. Since I was in the mood for a Whopper and just had the worst chicken sandwich, I found it not bad. Not the best burger either and it did not shatter any expectations, but at least it was what I expected, no more, no less."}
{"text":"Ok, SERIOUSLY?!?!? What the hell am i really paying for? I said a \"sausage burrito, just with no sausage\" usually when i come during the week they ask me if i just want egg and cheese, i always say \"yes, and with hashbrowns and spicy sauce\". And then today i get this bullshit. Are the good cooks during the week or what? Id hate to be the one to stay at the window and check cuz i HATE wasting my time and yours. Thats not even a full fricken egg thats a damn mouthful. Next time im gunna stay at the window and open up the burrito till you get it right. Fricken terrible."}
{"text":"In between flights, I wanted some breakfast.  The lady at the front counter was nice and took my order.  Then, I proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait.  There were three of us waiting at the time and it took a really really long time for our food to come out.  The guy in the back who was preparing our food was not in a hurry.  He was taking his sweet time and not too worried about us getting our food in a timely manner.  The food was good once it came, but it's pretty standard for BK.  The service needed some pep in its step."}
{"text":"It's not this Burger King that is absolutely disgusting, it's all of them. The lady in the window was nice...but seriously EW. Burger King was much much MUCH better 15 years ago."}
{"text":"Still very slow service at drive through. Been waiting for close to 15 minutes since food ordered"}
{"text":"Not only the worst BK franchise I've ever been to... but probably the worst-managed restaurant franchise I've ever encountered. It's a like a bad (bad) movie...  OPEN ON two guys and a girl in a GREEN SOUL ordering drive through from Burger King on East Wash. They are hungry, but their order is easy. Just three burgers, twp fries, and one drink.  AUDIO OVER (BK INTERCOM VOICE, with a bored lackluster air): \"Okay, drive up to the window.\"  The CAR pulls up behind two other cars waiting for their orders. And they wait. And wait. And wait. Six minutes later, the first car finally gets their food and drives off.  The CARS pull up closer. And they wait. And wait. And wait.  A few minutes later, two uniformed BURGER KING EMPLOYEES, one man and one woman, exit the restaurant. They hang out in by the waiting CARS in front of the restaurant. Chatting for a few minutes, then amble back into the restaurant.  The CARS continue to wait. Minutes more pass.  Two more BURGER KIND EMPLOYEES, two women, exit the store with a TODDLER in tow, but they are carrying huge bags of BK food.  The DRIVER of the GREEN SOUL, \"This is ridiculous, we've been waiting over 10 minutes, I'm getting out of here.  Mickey D's is right over there.... Wait... Hey, are those BK employees carrying out FOOD?!\"  BURGER KING EMPLOYEE #1, puts up her arm carrying a huge bag of TAKEOUT and uses her body to physically block the GREEN SOUL from leaving. The TODDLER wanders aimlessly and dangerously around the parking lot.  The CAR in front of the GREEN SOUL receives their order finally, and drives off. The CAR waiting for food behind the SOUL peels out of line, barely missing the wandering TODDLER.  BURGER KING EMPLOYEE #1 (shouting at the CASHIER through the window): \"How long have these nice people been waiting?!   CASHIER (searching for the order ticket): \"Um... 15 minutes.\"  BK EMPLOYEE #1 (shouting): \"Well, give them two free ice creams for making them wait so long!\"  SOUL PASSENGER #1 (quietly): \"It's okay, we just want the food we ordered.... And, besides, there are three of us. Not two.\"  BK EMPLOYEE (angrily shouting through the cashier window): \"Just get them some ice cream... they were almost going to leave, you guys are so slow. Lucky I stopped them. You're the manager. Manage!\"  A few more minutes pass. One single ICE CREAM is passed through the window to the waiting passengers. Then, finally, a BAG with the burgers and fries arrives. The GREEN SOUL drives off down East Wash. Watching carefully to be sure the wandering TODDLER isn't in the way.  SOUL PASSENGER takes a bite out of his burger, and spits it out into a napkin: \"Oh my god! How in the hell did they ruin a Whopper, for chrissakes!?   SOUL DRIVER: What's wrong with it?  SOUL PASSENGER #1: \"It's cold. And I mean cold. It doesn't taste like meat. It's just rubbery and tasteless... and where's the char-broiled taste? Did they forget to add it? The cheese is in no way melted. There's a wilted mass of white lettuce core shoved in the middle, like a bad surprise. The bun crusty and stale.... do I need to go on--?  SOUL PASSENGER #2, sampling a french fry: \"And my fries are soggy and cold, too.... and no ketchup packets in the bag. And my bun's stale, too!\"  SOUL DRIVER starts to laugh: \"that was so bad, I expected cameras to come out of the door next, 'smile, you're on candid camera!\"  SOUL PASSENGER #1: \"Or 'Punked.\"  SOUL PASSENGER #2: \"We were punked, all right. Let's ditch this sorry excuse for food and order Culver's... the food is always hot and delicious there. And the staff is nice and helpful, too.  The GREEN SOUL exits East Wash, and on the way into CULVER'S, PASSENGER #1 exits the vehicle, and throws the BK bags of food away in the CULVER'S garbage can.   SOUL PASSENGER #2 getting back into the car: \"Never again.\"  SOUL PASSENGER #1 and SOUL DRIVER: \"Never again!\"  THE END."}
{"text":"Came through drive this morning around 0600. I had to repeat order multiple times. He asked if we needed any sauce but failed to give it to us. Got home and realized that one of my sandwiches were missing and our hash browns were a size smaller than what we ordered, also no sauce and the food was cold. We live two minutes from there so I know for a fact they didn't warm the food. I understand customer service and how people make mistakes but the fact that we were the only people there and was still missing part of our order makes me feel like they don't care much for their customers. Definitely won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"This review is mainly about the limited time offer \"Angriest Whopper\". I don't usually rate fast food chains, but in this case I will rate the product.  This store is like any other. It's close to home so this is where I came to try the newest addition to the menu. I don't usually like Burger King, but the \"Angriest Whopper\" is very good. The bun is a bright red. (a lot of food coloring I imagine). It has a slight burn to it as it has hot sauce baked in and is topped with sesame seeds. The burger is a probably frozen quarter pound patty grilled through. This is topped with crispy bacon, Generous amounts of lettuce and tomato, Jalapeño peppers, onion rings, and cheese. They put mayo on of course unless you ask not to.  This burger is so far my favorite one they have ever offered. It was juicy, spicy, and tasty. The fries were over salted as is the case at most fast food joints. I might get another chance to get one of these burgers before the promotion ends."}
{"text":"Out for a long walk Saturday morning. Kneaders Bakery on Bell Road is no longer open. Balkan Bakery is slammed...no Bureks in the case. Batting 0 for 2...decided  to go to Burger King.  Pleasant surprise...had two Sausage Biscuits and a Senior Coffee for $2.57. Biscuit and sausage was good. Coffee was hot. Service was exceptional and place was clean.  Coffee refill, WiFi and large flat screen. They even have computer play stations for little ones."}
{"text":"First of all, it's a fast food place, so it's difficult to really complain about the service.  I am not sure some snot nosed 16 year old even knows what \"service\" means.  That being said, everyone I've encountered in the drive-thru has always been friendly.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when the order taker interrupts you during your order - this isn't my first trip to the rodeo, so just let me finish and THEN ask your questions.  Anyhow, I try and stay away from fast food places as much as possible.  But sometimes, when you are hungover, nothing is better than the chicken sandwich meal at Burger King.  This is a strange location.  I have NEVER actually received my order at the window.  I am ALWAYS asked to pull around to the front, even when there is nobody behind me. I just don't get it.  They also have a \"king sweet meal\" (or something along those lines) that comes with a sundae.  3/4 of the time they say that the ice cream machine is down or is done for the night.  If something is on your menu, shouldn't it be available during your business hours?  As I said when I started this review, it is hard to really complain about fast food, because you get what you pay for.  It is what it is as they say."}
{"text":"Of all the time and places that I've been to burger king, I rare this 3 stars. Taste was mediocre, portion size was very small,and the sauce portion was inconsistent. We ordered for me,my brother, and my mom. I had a lot of sauce while my brother barely had any. All in all, 3 stars"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is the food. If there was another BK near me I would definitely drive elsewhere. A couple days ago I show up about 15 minutes before closing and the manager asks do I want it for here or to go so I say \"for here\" then the worker I think her name was Cerena or Serena VERY RUDELY said YOU REALIZE WE CLOSE IN 5 MINUTES after I asked why my food was bagged to go? I'm currently in the drive thru right now and once again the lady behind the drive thru speaker was incredibly rude as well cutting me off while I order with an attitude. Like can you wait til I finish my order until you ask me questions. Once again you could tell they all have a very low level of customer service here.. BK needs to hire workers that actually want to be there."}
{"text":"Rather decent little establishment . Well a simple Burger King . But a bit slow . . At least mid afternoon .  This one is located in the parking lot down the way from Giant Eagle . Great to stop by on your way to grocery shop  ! Apparently not everyone thinks the same . . All you can do is check it out sometime  !."}
{"text":"Well, as I'd said to others : always thought well of Burger King . True \" Flame Broiled \" burger's \" less of a grease issue to deal with there . And TRUE beef products . Well just can't wait to personally know more . Now the problem : people place their judgement without true knowledge ! Now I have applied to work there, and being mentally challenged ( not really EXTREMELY apparent , but after 9 years of coma's after a brain tumor what do you expect !? )  But I have checked out THIS Burger King in Moon . And decent place, wasn't very busy INSIDE but it was mid day and continuous drive thru orders . Now do me a favor kids ; just don't judge what you don't know  ."}
{"text":"came through the drive thru and ordered a coffee at 9:00 am.  I was told they did not have any coffee.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped while traveling in the interstate.  Heap, quick and hot. Gave the extra star because there was outside seating."}
{"text":"What a horrible place.  I question if the employees can read.  Sweet and sour sauce is in the bag.  No it isn't and show them the honey mustard they put in yet they still insist it's sweet and sour.  Food is sub par even for Burger King.  Do yourself a favor and go to the McDonald's across the street."}
{"text":"If I could, I would not give a star at all.   This place is not worth it. They rarely, and I do mean RARELY take any coupons. It is expensive place to even eat at. They even jip you on food.  Ordered 2 large fries and 2 large drinks..... The lady in front of me also ordered fries... They needed to make more fries. Instead, the lady behind the counter decides to CUT the fries in HALF trying to create 3 large fries out of what would not even equal a large fry and a half!  Even the lady in front me said she did not mind waiting for fresh fries.... I said the same thing. And the lady behind the counter was upset that we wanted to wait for more fries.  NEVER GO HERE!! EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"I work third shift and usually roll through the drive thru about 10:30 pm and would like to say that they do ok."}
{"text":"First off I want to say I really like burger king. I believe this may be the worst BK I have ever been to. I have eaten there 4 times now. Every time I received cold food. The last time my burger felt like it was just pulled out of a cooler. At least the prior times they were room temperature. I took the burger back and spoke with the manager about it. He said that he would fix it, his solution was to throw it into the microwave. I thought this was unbelievable. Every employee I had encountered acts as if waiting on a customer is a bother. I was able to consider the first couple visits as a fluke. however after seeing how the manager solves customer issues I realize there is no hope of receiving quality food or service at this location."}
{"text":"It amazes me that, despite the slew of one-star reviews on Yelp, this store does nothing to change anything. Who in the hell owns/runs this place? How does it stay open? It should have closed years ago, but somehow it manages to cling to enough clientele to keep it running.   Wife and child went here the other day because they had a coupon for a free burger. It took 12 minutes to get the thing, and it was cold.   Someone who knows what they're doing needs to step up and start running this place."}
{"text":"Coffee is terrible. It tastes like watered down coffee stolen from starbucks. No one knows where the lids are, creamer is and they make you collaborate with other coffee drinkers to explore where each item is. Guess it is Burger Kings version of coffeemon go."}
{"text":"Disgusting place to be honest. Rude staff and bad customer service. I ordered an iced coffee and got some other weird shit that didnt even taste like an iced coffee. Told the guy i wanted to exchange it for a normal size drink cup instead an he said \"no\" I told him then that i always order that same iced coffee at other locations and that this wasn't it. He then asked his manager again if he could do the exchange for me and when he came back he gave me a kids cup and left. I put the iced coffee on the table and told him he could throw it away for me. Burger King is just not the same anymore. Never buying food from them again."}
{"text":"This Burger King SUCKS. Terrible service, filthy appearance, employees that just don't care about customer service. Manager should be fired immediately!!!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty and employees dress unprofessional.   Fountain machine is broken, so they are selling you flat drinks.  Asked for a manager, and they do not even know her name and last name.  Worst Burger King ever!!!"}
{"text":"If you like mayo on your sandwiches, they sure do put a lot. Next time I'll go Lighty #knowiknow"}
{"text":"Drive thur seem very nice lol thanks for the food id recommend to anyone in this area for a lunch dinner or a snack. They got everything for fish sandwiches burgers and salads to Oreo shake and Reese cup pies !!! I love it"}
{"text":"Drive thru breakfast in a neighborhood that I don't know at all. It was good that they had wifi because the wait was long and they were sloooooooow! At least they got my order right!"}
{"text":"For the inside dining experience, McDonald's beats Burger King, hands down. In the sandwich wars, I prefer the Whopper to the Big Mac. Fries? McDonald's. Drink options? Tie. Dessert? Burger King. Play Place? BK.  This is a fair Burger King, but the thing they have going for them is that even though the dining room is open from 6 AM to 10 PM, the drive through is open 24 hours. In the middle of the night when you're working a late shift in the South Park area, there isn't much else for a meal unless you want to drive clear across town. That makes this bright lit BK a good thing. But if it's day time, I'm probably going to choose the fancy two-story McD's a block away."}
{"text":"Very recently remodeled Burger King, they sent me a mailer with buy one get one Whopper or Croissanwich. It's right across the street from my gym, so after burning off the calories, I figured I would load them back on.  Decent parking and a clean restaurant, it looks more modern than other BK's I have visited. Self-serve soda fountain includes a ketchup dispenser. The napkin holders were filled but not so much that they were tight.  My order was taken quickly and the croissanwiches were prepared fresh and placed in the appropriate BK paper bag.  Not much else to say, it's a Burger King. Four stars because it's nicer than many others I've been to, but not five stars because, hey, it's Burger King."}
{"text":"There's a reason why they call it fast food. I was across the street for a class and this was really the only option within walking distance. Standard BK fare - my Whopper with cheese and no pickle was as I ordered it. I think they've done something different to the fries since the last time I was at a BK as they were thicker and fuller than usual. In, order, fill soda (Coke products), get sandwich, head back to class. All told, 10 minutes from door to door to door.  Nothing to write home about it. It's a Burger King."}
{"text":"Wow, this BK needs some help. I think the other one down in the E concourse has the terminals where you can order your food without talking to anyone. I like that one. I can customize without having to repeat myself three times as I've done here today.  It should be simple to order a Whopper with cheese, no onions and extra tomatoes. And it was. After three tries.  The order pickup process needs some organization.  The fries were good and the burger was as I ordered."}
{"text":"We have always come to this BK location.  The kids playground is awesome, customer service is great and we've never had our order incorrectly made.  They have recently remodeled the interior and are working on the outside.  It looks awesome! The best time is during the week in the morning."}
{"text":"Visited this place again. Things haven't changed! Employees that aren't friendly and seem to hate their job. The chicken nuggets I got for my granddaughter were dry and the fries were just as bad.i didn't even give them to her, they went in the trash! I felt as if they were from the day before. Such a sucky Burger King! They need either employees that care or close this location because it gives Burger king a bad rap!!"}
{"text":"It's always a wait at this Burger King. I am  like dang do they make anything anymore. It's right beside my Job but I can't even have a lunch break there Bc the staff so slow . I can tell they don't care about their job at all"}
{"text":"I walked here on a beautiful, cool evening and ordered a chocolate hot fudge sundae. As soon as I finished it and started the return trip home I began to itch snd by the time I arrived home I had scratched my arms red and raw. My back was itchy too. I have never experienced this reaction to anything before. Was it the sundae? It wasn't as good as a McDonald's sundae I am sad to admit. I wonder what chemicals were im that BK sundae? I hope it isn't so!!"}
{"text":"Consistently poor/slow service.  Orders incorrect half the time.  Daughter just timed our drive thru experience at over 8 minutes... For cheese burgers."}
{"text":"This Burger King needs to upgrade its menu. People are trending to more healthier foods. News flash- a low carb burger is wrapped in lettuce!  I didn't expect to eat a burger with a fork!"}
{"text":"This restaurant says it's open till midnight on the website however at 10:30 its already closed on a Friday night. In 5 minutes saw 4 or 5 cars pull in. Most probably won't come back not knowing if it's going to be open or not. If it can't even follow its hours of operation is it following proper health code practices. Not saying it doesn't but...."}
{"text":"So I ordered my food and I asked for fresh food off the grill or the boiler whatever you wanna call it . Got up to the window and my food was cold but they made it fresh. That made me so mad and I took my food back inside and got my money back and when confronted that my food was not fresh the manager was so damn rude and asked for the receipt knowing he jus seen me from the drive thru. Had the nerve to ask me for my receipt but couldn't even admit that the food was not fresh so I went to a Nother Burger King and asked for fresh food and they gave me fresh food they told me hey can you park in the front we're making your food fresh so that was the difference between this Burger King and another one I went to I would advise not to go here."}
{"text":"Every single time I go...  not so \"fresh\" food.  I can't complain about the people, but the food is never the same and always stale."}
{"text":"POOR customer service.. just a couple weeks ago I got DENIED half spicy and regular nuggets for my order.. got two sloppy whoppers instead and got sick.. Couldnt even call the manager the next day... Chunks of the burger were coming out and I have proof of the dumpster looking whoppers.. They said it was against the rules to half and half my order.. I do it all the  time at other locations. Young teen who doesnt deserve a job thats for sure.. Its having it our way right?? Granted its fast food like lets be real for a second.. You are feeding us junk let us have it. Sooo not cool so I went all the way to sahara and eastern they were fabulous."}
{"text":"I've gone to this Burger King a few times and I'm not one to complain but after tonight I'm going to. Their fries are always cold and it seems like they've been sitting out and were pulled too early from the fryer. Not very happy with it. The chicken fries also seem to sit out before being ordered."}
{"text":"Service is so slow even during off peak times. One day waited five minutes for a cheeseburger. Another day even longer for a chicken sandwich without mayo that ended up coming out soaked in it. I know they've recently opened and I freaking love BK. But come on...fast food, please!!!!"}
{"text":"Burger King is my dirty little pleasure. Whopper, Jr with cheese and no mayo hits the spot every time. I'm giving this chain location five stars because they're always super busy but food is served fast and fresh. People working there are nice and patient. Let's face it, we all want our fast food cravings handled with love and care. Right? This location was filthy and disgusting filled with less than savory characters for decades. Now it's clean and bright and there's no worries about sitting down and enjoying that Whopper goodness. Flame-Broiled, baby!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not normally a fast-food type person but we had this gig to do that included purchasing a Whopper so we did. The store is not necessarily clean on the outside we don't know what the inside looks like because we didn't go inside. But let me tell you that Whopper was delicious perfect perfect perfect thank you Burger King"}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru for breakfast this morning.  6-5-15 8:30 am   I had a sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit combo w/ coffee.    Biscuit & tater tots were awesome!!!   I asked for four creams and two splendas in my coffee and received maybe one of each.  The coffee was terrible. It's right up there with the coffee you get in the waiting room at a service station.  Blech.  I wish they would have at least put the cream and splenda in there to cover up the nasty taste."}
{"text":"Best Burger King I've been to. Fastest service i have ever received at a fast food restaurant. Especially in the drive-thru. It's clean, the staff is very nice and cool to talk to and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Noch ein Hinweis: Achtung hier wird nur Barzahlung akzeptiert - keine EC oder Kredit- oder Debit-Kartenzahlung"}
{"text":"My daughter is a PICKY eater...AND she has food allergies (eggs, dairy)  Lately, the only surefire way to make her eat anything is to tell her it has bacon in it....seriously.  So as we fly back from a week of rest and relaxation in Mexico I see this sign...shining like a bacon...errr...beacon of hope....  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DmyS9b7ykIOo7XwYt5I9wg?select=k8y8sNAXTl6XMzg5Qr61rg  God Bless America....and God Bless Bacon."}
{"text":"The BK Lounge, as my colleagues have referred to it...Dane Cook we dem boys...is an absolute disaster.    I mean it.  Period.  End if discussion.  The only reason why I don't make it 1 star is because there have been some babes, that are struggling in this economy, and I know they're working hard for their money.  And if you've been following me on Yelp (hint: go check out my Little Chicago Pizza review) you know I always respect the star adage to any company because of babes.    So it's safe to say that Hooters will never get a 1 star from me.   So enjoy BK.  You win this round.  But when I become a Millionaire I will take the babes off of your hand, maybe take em out to a nice meal and a shopping spree, and I will give you your one star review.    Until then...Btw BK babes hit me up #BKBabes"}
{"text":"Hate Burger King and haven't eaten here in years... Only time I came in was for their mini cinabuns.. That's about it"}
{"text":"Location is close to work, so been here a couple of times, for both dine-in and drive-thru.  Service is good.  Food quality is good.  Nothing wrong with my orders so far.  Happy with this location and would go again, as long as I'm in the mood for their fast food.  Since trying their iced coffees, I like them better than McDonald's...they are sweeter and have better flavor!"}
{"text":"About the only thing I can say good about this location is that they finally got my order correct!"}
{"text":"We had two separate orders but they would not take them at the drive thru so my mom went inside and I continued through the drive thru. I ordered 2 original chicken sandwich's, 2 small fries and a large onion ring. I gave the women a $20 and a coupon that was for $4.99 for the sandwich's and fries, to pay for the order and she gave me back $4 and change and the coupon. When I got to the second window I mention that she didn't honor the coupon and I was suppose to have more money back. I gave them the $4 and they left the window open and my food sitting on the window (it was currently 47 degrees out). I waited for nearly 5 minutes and no one came back to the window. I drove through and walked in. I said I wanted them to remake my order since it was now cold. She asked me what my order was again and I said that you have my receipt. The manager then gave me back $6 and change. I finally put the money on the counter and said I wanted a full refund, which took another few minutes. I drove to another Burger King and used a second coupon, the exact same and ordered the exact same thing and they gave me $12 in change back, which is correct. The North Durango location is ripping customers off. Additionally, while my mom was inside she noticed that there were at least 25 pre made sandwich's and no one was in line. Then she watched them clean off the dirty tables and put the condiments back into the bins. No one wants old sandwich's and no one wants someone else's ketchup and napkins. The location was very dirty compared to the second location and it was poorly lighted."}
{"text":"We went through the drive thru and I did not check the order before I drove away. I drove back, walked in and they had my bag. It was very clean inside and well lighted. They apologized and gave me my order."}
{"text":"Burger King food is Burger King food. Just like any other fast food it should always taste the same no matter what location you go to. That being said, it's the service that matters.  This Burger King has by far the SLOWEST 'fast food' drive through. It takes entirely too long to order and get food quickly. I sometimes fly by here after a soccer game to get a yummy frozen Coke, so that should take what? 1 minute max to make? Whatever the reason I'm left to wait, mind wandering while I watch employees in the drive up window moving around without a purpose.  As an FYI this Burger King has also been redone, the interior and exterior. So the ambiance has improved some what. Overall if you don't have to eat here, then pass her by!"}
{"text":"Great burger, friendly service, fast efficient service.  1.  Eye contact and greet.  2.  Take order. 3. Confirmation.  4.  Quote the final Price.  5.  Upsale offered. 6.  Prompt delivery time.  7. Food in right portion and tempersture.  8.  Serving option (dine in or take away).  9. Thank the customers.    Most people always take the staffs at these establishment for granted.  Please offer praise when it is deserved.  How often do we get awful service in finer dining place and they demand a 18% tip or you might have to look for a spat in your plate or dirty looks throughout your visit?"}
{"text":"Ordered food fresh from the fryer..maybe i should have asked for it freshly cooked because it was 100% raw chicken..be careful especially if you have kids."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten BK is a while. It's greasier than I remember (i.e. Chicken fries). I tried the tender grill chicken sandwich - it was falling apart, soggy and not at all tasty. My hubby's burger wasn't that much better."}
{"text":"I usually limit myself to fast food chains as a means to provide limited nourishment while on a long car drive. But this weekend we were babysitting my niece and nephew, and when we asked them where they wanted to go for lunch they chose Burger King.   The one thing I hate about the location is that it's a pain to get to, as there is no direct turn off of Sam Furr Rd. Once we managed to get there, I found the store to be clean and we were served mighty quickly for it being lunchtime on a Sunday (note: we did not use the restrooms so I can't vouch for their upkeep.) The food was cooked to order with no problems. The kids enjoyed going outside into the play area, and we killed some time there.  I guess BK is good if you need someplace quick to eat or need to give the kids something to do for a bit. There are better chains out there with better quality food, but you get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"I visited this location on Mother's day and the first time thru they gave me different food than I had ordered. I ran back thru and the manager was extremely friendly and apologetic. Service was great and in the end he gave me 2 coupons and the wrong order as well. He seemed very genuine. Food tasted great!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest Burger King known to man. The manager told a customer that his order was going to take 20 minutes. If I had known that my wait was that long, I would have walked.   20 minutes after I get our food, it was still wrong.   Also, so ghetto in here. Ketchup by request only. Restrooms need the key from the manager. No water available at the fountain. Yuck.   Save yourself. Skip this location!!!"}
{"text":"We don't eat Burger King often because there isn't a close location anymore.  We decided to go to Kannapolis and have a Whopper since it had been a while since we had been to BK.  When we pulled into the parking lot the drive thru was backed up.  We were dining in so we didn't think it mattered.  We were wrong.  There was also a line at the register and a line waiting for food.  The employees stopped taking order at the register and directed their attention to the drive thru.  The cashier decided to make an announcement apologizing for the wait and promised to take our order as soon as she could.  She then went back to help out with drive thru.  The line to the register was mad.  People left in disgust.  The people waiting for their food was in disbelief.  The employees had a bad attitude and didn't understand what they were doing was bad business. The service was horrid. They had a  good sanitation posted and somehow the dining area was tidy.  The food was okay once we finally received it."}
{"text":"Website says they are open til midnight...sign on the window says open late, but I stopped by at 11:30 and it's closed. All the lights are off and no one is answering the phone. Update your website or stay open until the time advertised. This was a waste of my gas and time!"}
{"text":"On my Great Hierarchy of Burger Chains, Burger King ranks at or near the bottom. It actually goes something like Licks - Hero - Harveys - Wendys - McDonalds - Burger King. That said, I find myself in this location with some regularity, for one main reason: convenience. It's located right in the middle of a veritable techno-Mecca centred around College and Spadina in Toronto. So when I make my pilgrimage out to feed my technolust, it's the most logical / lazy place to grab a bite to eat. It's also air conditioned, which beats the crap out of some of the local pizza joints, and whoever programs the music for Burger King does pick a good selection of oldies but goodies.  That said, once I start eating here I usually start reconsidering my decision. The food ain't great even by fast food standards, the burgers usually falling apart rather quickly. They're also ridiculously stingy with the ketchup - you get given a certain number of packets when you order. All distribution of condiments, napkins, straws etc. is handled at point of purchase, making for difficulties should you experience a gravity-related incident.  The clientele is certainly interesting. It runs the gamut from local University students (the restaurant is located at the southwest corner of U of T), fellow geeks doing some shopping, and what can only be described as a ragtag bunch of sketchy locals. I don't think I've ever been in there without at least one homeless dude and someone looking completely strung out on who knows what sitting a few tables away.  Probably because of this, the bathroom situation is interesting. Access to the facilities - capable of serving but a single member of the respective users at a time - is controlled by the cashiers behind the counter. If you're desperate and it's busy in there, things could get messy.  Bottom line: if you're in the area and really want a burger and fries... well, this place is certainly in the area. Don't expect much in the way of quality, though."}
{"text":"Tried to order a shake but apparently their shake machine isn't working. This franchise has decided not to offer any until next summer. I guess they make enough profit from the $5 bottled waters and overpriced meals. Also, their ice machine ran out. When another customer asked for ice, the young lady instructed him to grab ice next door from a different establishment. Made me chuckle."}
{"text":"Terminal three at the Las Vegas airport is clean and new and has many slot machines waiting to take your money. But the biggest rip off is if your hungry before your flight. I get that airport prices are higher than elsewhere but Burger King has to be kidding to.charge over $13 with tax  included for a chicken sandwich combo  They should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"Young lady that served me was busy chatting (about nothing related to work) with another male coworker, so i had to wait to order til she was done chatting. She kept talking to him as she took my order, barely acknowledging i was standing there. I asked her for honey mustard, she didnt even hear me. She handed my receipt and card back without even looking at me or saying thank you,  still talking to the coworker.  I still wanted honey mustard, so finally I said Excuse me, to which she replied, Huh? I repeated myself and she says they will help you with sauces down there when you pick up your order.  I went to the other end, they threw my chicken fingers in a bag and folded it, never asking me if i wanted any sauce at all. And no thanks or nothing.   I was hoping the chicken fingers would at least be good, but no such luck - they were dry/hard and not good at all. Buyers remorse set in, but it was now 10pm and everything else in the airport was closed.   Not going back to this place."}
{"text":"Walked in, ordered fully loaded breakfast biscuit which according to the description is a fr she made biscuit with egg, cheese, ham, sausage and bacon.  To start the biscuit was far from fresh, very hard.  Second NO egg!!!!  How does hat happen?!  Posted a photo as proof!"}
{"text":"WORST service! My car didn't move from the drive through for 8 minutes before in taking my order!!! Finally got my order (only 3 cars ahead of me). Entire process took 22 minutes!! Drive thru!!!! Only 3 cars ahead of me!! Work right around the corner and my lunch break is 30 mins. Took more than 20 just to get my damn lunch!!! Ps they only gave me ONE packet of sauce for 20 nuggets!!"}
{"text":"Had the $1 hotdog special, I can't believe the hotdog was great with onions, relish, mustard and ketchup. Great all around service. Thanks Burger King."}
{"text":"Clean inside. Broken soda fountain and non working ice machine. Guy at counter seemed stressed out a bit . Had to wait for part of order told would bring out to table. Never happened had to go back and ask for it. Food was so so as usual supposed to have a med fry with meal  got small. It's the little things they fail on that make my visits far and few. New Oreo state fair fried cookies suck too !"}
{"text":"What can I say it's a BK. Clean outside ok inside. Pleasant staff got order wrong two times. Food was what it was decent overall thankfully. There's a play space inside for the rug rats to run amuck in while you dream of better days ahead. They have some new crazy menu items like fruit loop shakes and the Cheetos mac and cheese bites. Not my thing but look ok. Close to home I'll return in sure. Nothing bad to say nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"They cram everything so hard into the bag in an effort to not give you two bags, but then there's no way to hold the bag except by the bottom. You also can't close the top so everything gets cold in the top of the bag. They crammed the bag so much that it broke the fry holder, not to mention they didn't fill it full. When I pay extra for large fries I don't want it to have the same amount as my medium fries. There is also an unholy amount of salt on the fries, I'm not sure I can even eat them."}
{"text":"Every time, I have come here the Burger King The place is clean and the food is fresh and good. The employees are also fast and very helpful and nice."}
{"text":"They asked me to wait out front for my food, as you can see from the receipt I've been waiting for 30 minutes. I have a toddler in the car which is why I opted for drive-thru so I went back through drive-they only this time there were more cars creating a longer wait. Seriously ridiculous!!!!"}
{"text":"I order food delivery on grub hub all the time. I recently noticed that burger king was just added for no delivery minimum or delivery fee. I decided to give it a try and last week my order only took about 15 minutes and was all correct. Today I ordered a salad and chicken nuggets. The salad is completely brown and wilted, not to mention my cheese is wet and soggy! My chicken nuggets are burnt and hard as a hockey puck. I even tipped 20%. Wow thanks burger king for wasting my money and making me starve. BIG THUMBS DOWN!"}
{"text":"Yeah I dont think I will go here anymore because when the lady cook slaps my burger together without latex on that grosses me out ! And when a food prepper is to lazy to put latex gloves on then 80% chance they are to lazy to wash their hands. Flu season she could have been with snotty nosed sick kids just before she came to work......"}
{"text":"Would have to say, Best local chain in this location! Had a bunch of coupons, and they weren't busy but placed my order and got a great discount with the coupons so everything was hot, sandwiches were made correctly (no mayo), chicken sandwich , good for fast food  Jr. Whopper w/bacon & cheese, good, chicken sub sandwiches were ok but cooked perfectly, chicken I think processed Whopper deal was good and worth the $! Macaroni fried  My brother liked it but I didn't  Think I will stick with the French fries  Definitely worth going back and recommended but breakfast ends at 10:30am."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru. We were the only car there. Ordered the 2 for 6 deal, a double bacon Swiss, and a large fry. Was charged $17 and change. We paid and then proceeded to wait 8 minutes or more for our food. When we received our food, the fries were warm. They should have been hot like they had just come out of the fryer, considering the time spent waiting. We had ordered all of our sandwiches without tomatoes. We got home and the double bacon Swiss had tomatoes on it. Had it been any of the other sandwiches it wouldn't have been a huge deal, but the person eating the sandwich has a huge issue with tomatoes. The tag even said no tomatoes. This BK was not busy AT ALL. Our order should have been perfect and piping hot.... Very very disappointed"}
{"text":"Very slow. Poor customer service. Dried out breakfast crossaint sandwiches that must've been made an hour earlier and have wilted under the heat lamps. On several occasions they've run out of tater tots, which boggles my mind. They premake crossainwiches by the tens, yet save making hash rounds until five minutes after the customer orders them?  I've been here over ten times simply because it's on my commute and I thought it would be quick. Each time I go, I think it will be better. It never is. This morning was the last time I'm doing this to myself. I deserve better."}
{"text":"An older style Burger King. Great quick service. Went through the drive thru, paid when I got to the window. They had me park out front to bring my food out but I was waiting on chicken. Glad to see the car behind me got to pay and get there food too, instead of waiting behind me until I get my order. Thats what fast food is all about! Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Find a different BK to go to. They have a bunch of irresponsible teenagers running the show. My order was taken 3 times and still was wrong! Their drive thru time is horrible as well.  Don't waste your time... I'M sure there are other burger places to go to NEAR by with WAY BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE....!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review: Another place I won't visit again in Champaign. DNV list. I read the reviews and was thinking it can't be that bad. Well I was wrong. The location itself is very nice, completely remodeled and new inside. The service was 0 stars if possible. The cashier attitude was very poor and I mean that she seemed annoyed when customers were using coupons. It would take her 5 minute with each customer. She continued to roll her eyes when customers asked why they could not use a coupon. When she picked up a whopper off the line she just casually tossed it on the tray and said here. I watched as she flicked a fry or some debris on the table where the fries are salted back into the holding area. To make matters worse she did not acknowledge customer complaints. There was a customer who complained that his nuggets were cold in the middle and not fried well. When she didn't do anything about it, the customer asked to speak with the manager. She promptly fired back that she was the manager. They do not have name tags so I have no idea who this lady was. After more complaining she grabbed the nuggets and angrily tossed them in the garbage and muttered that he just wanted free stuff and had another order brought out. In all my fast food experience I have not seem such atrocious behavior. You should be glad that you have a job that pays the bill. After you order it took close to 10 minutes for my 2 whoppers to be prepared. This is simply unacceptable, there are a lot of other places to eat. This has been forwarded to corporate and of course I get a a canned response saying sorry you were not happy we strive to do the best. Burger King you should send some mystery diners to experience how this is a let down from your corporate motto of have it your way. It is more likely have it no way. All this being said, I will not be back based on the above experience.  Pro: none  Cons: Long wait time, terrible customer service  Hidden gem: If you chose to come and eat here use a coupon at least"}
{"text":"Year 1 Restaurant Review: Please refer to my old review for the complete experience. The food continues to be well prepared and quick. Service is friendly. My only complaint is with some of the sketchy customers that come in. For example I was just here for dinner and a bunch of kids basically stormed in. Some of them grabbed a drink cup when there was no cashier and I don't know if they even paid for it. They were coming into and out of the restaurant. It was rather weird. Another time I watched an employee get fired after he bad mouthed the manager saying if he was too busy he would not mark the wrapper to indicate custom orders. When she told him that if he doesn't want to listen and follow orders he was free to go. That employee stormed off and was fired on the spot. I think in the future drive thru is the way too go, but otherwise whopper still beats McD any day.  Health grade: B http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1405"}
{"text":"First off, I've been eating at the \"King\" since i was a kid. But after my last visit, I don't think that I will ever be back to this place ever again.   I had gone through the drive-through, and waited about 15 minutes to get through the line. Now, I understand that there are times when that cannot be avoided, and i shrugged off that anoyance.   Not a big deal, but as i was waiting, my attention was grabbed by something crawling on the wall. As i turned to see what it was, i was disgusted by the sight of cockroaches all over the wall!  My first reaction, was to roll up my window and drive away, but i was hungry and stayed to pick up my meal. Although I should have acted on my first thought. Because, after I got home, there on the seat next to me, were two large roaches. I kind of freaked, got ridd of the intruders, and threw my dinner away.    This all gives me serious concerns about the cleanliness of the inside of this establishment. I dont think that I want to risk another visit there again.  P.S. I found another one in my car the next morning. It gives me the willies just thinking about the whole experience."}
{"text":"This is new location. I'm so happy it's here as Carl's Jr. down the road closed. It's closest fast food burger place near the high school next to Walmart, so I predict it'll be very popular.  My son loves their whopper and Jr. whopper for me. Their onion rings are also yummy. They have drive-thru window so this morning, I decided to get an order of hash browns to go with my coffee. It was hot and fresh. Very quick service as most of the kids were in school."}
{"text":"Never again! Was disrespected by the cashier at the drive thru.  She went off on me for no reason because I had a \"coupon\".  Eye rolls and tossing things at me as I apologized?  I could see if I provoked her but I did nothing to instigate that kind of treatment.  Called to complain to the shift manager and was told \"it was busy and she was stressed\".  Really??  There was 1 car ahead of me and maybe 1 that pulled up after me.  Even if it was really busy, no reason to be rude and disrespectful to customers that are treating you respectfully.  A call has been placed to the corporate office and the survey on the receipt has been filled out accordingly.  BEWARE!!!  this place is obviously run very poorly by people who do not care."}
{"text":"I go through drive thru place my order only to find out they didn't have the French toast sticks .I originally came for !not only did they not have that .but no grape jelly then ,I get home and this is what they gave me smh ?"}
{"text":"The worst BK I have ever eaten at. It is not the facilities it's the food. I have been there twice first time I ordered a combo - mediocre (poorly put together, vegetables are not fresh etc.) The second time I went there to try their Poutine, because how can you screw up a Poutine?  Well it was bad - I felt like I was eating a piece of salt."}
{"text":"I got the cinnabon mini's here yesterday and have been trying to recover from food poisoning since. So disgusting. I will NEVER go to another burger king for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"You've been warned !!!!! Do not eat here. Employees are horrible at customer service, mess up everybody's order and give you the wrong food or either make you wait 15 minutes to get your food. It shouldn't be this hard to get a food order right but these people somehow can't do it"}
{"text":"It's is a good place is you like the originals that BK serves. The original chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"Had a drive for a fast food and decided to stop here. Nothing more, nothing else. Whopper was good. They have a new soda machine - fun to play with"}
{"text":"We went on Mother's Day of all days with coupons.  We were the only ones there. The cashier was very friendly.  I did have to mention after we walked in that there was a large puddle of water on the floor that needed mopped up.  At the soda fountain the floor was also wet where drinks had spilled.  These could have been easily taken care of if more attention was given to the dining room, and people cared."}
{"text":"Old Mexican lady probably manager is rude. Got attitude when I politely asked for buffalo sauce. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Horrible! As if there is any BK around here that does get your order right. Waited for 10 mins in drive thru, still can't get it right. Cold fries. What the heck people. It sucks that the town of Dallas doesn't have many options for fast food so we have to resort to places like this, but I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Will be contacting the health department asap. Most unsanitary place ever. Waited 15 minutes for our burger's, and then refused to give us water cups. Worse place ever"}
{"text":"Home of the whopp...   Burger King- I use this place as a breakfast stop because it is convenient and there is a serious dearth of choice in the E terminal for breakfast.   Like any airport eatery, this place takes full advantage of their captive audience and clubs you upside the head on food costs.  A Burger King breakfast will run you about $7-$10 here depending on what you get.  Ouch.  Coffee is not that bad and it is convenient if nothing else.  You decide."}
{"text":"Slow every time. Rude sometimes. Texting on cellphones on the floor in front of customers without washing hands. Forgot part of my order the last three times i've visited. Had to park and go inside after spending 20 mins in the drivethru and another 10 mins waiting for what they forgot. Manger tried to trick the drive thru censor by asking me to back up from the window to reset his time. This place is a mess. Worst fast food joint i've ever been too."}
{"text":"If i could give a zero i would. 15 min for a whopper meal. Dirty tables and chairs are just part of what waits you. My order taking service person was pleasant but crap other than that. This place sucks for timing. I stood in line while several customers that had  he same order as me got their food. I said that was messed up and they said the lady at the pass just got them in the order she did. If you are in a hurry, don't stop here. I also just racked my ass o. Their shot booth seat. F minus."}
{"text":"Burger King= whopper.  I got myself a whopper junior combo with fries. And then at the checkout, the sign for a deal on the chicken nuggets got me good, so I threw in an order of 10 pieces since it was a super deal. I can't recall but I think it was $1.99 or something.   The chicken nuggets had zero crisp and were sorta soggy. It's basically a larger shaped version of their flimsy chicken fries.   Their coffee was surprisingly decent. And despite my doubts that it was real coffee or had any caffeine, I definitely felt myself amped up a bit.   The whopper junior was as good as usual."}
{"text":"Usually great food. Today (lunch) the buns on both of our whoppers were so dry that they fell apart as we tried to eat them. After eating only half, I gave up with barely just a meat patty left. Was the bread old, previously frozen? After a long morning with an appointment, we decided not to share with staff, since the manager had disappeared to the back."}
{"text":"I went to burger king today and i asked for some extra bacon for my poutine. The manager there his name was Irfam he was generous not to charge me extra for the bacon after my order went through. This os great customer service. Every burger king should do that. I will go  ack there. They always have great service."}
{"text":"This place has gotten so disgusting my food is terrible and half burned and had like 8 pieces of lettuce. Disgusting dried out chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"I would never have written a review for this place if it weren't for my experience this weekend. First off let me say that this location is hit or miss. I've had good food and also had terrible food here. It is not consistent. The location in the mall, now that's a different story. They are good! Anyway, back to my experience, so we stopped here to get some quick food on our way out of town for a road trip.  I dislike fast food but I needed to be practical. We all ordered.  I ordered the big fish, which I've had before. Opened up my sandwich and it was gross!  Fish filet was like biting into a rubber shoe sole.  And it was cold. Also it was drenched, slathered and downing in tarter sauce and mayo. Super gross.  This is where the good part comes in:  as I was showing my husband what I was consuming, an employee (Latoya) walks by to deliver a bag of food to a drive through customer outside. She apparently noticed my disgust, I'm guessing, and asked from afar, \"do you not like it?\"  I told her it was nasty!  She walked over to my table and looked at my sandwich and said, \"oh no!  Do not eat that!  I would not eat that. I will get you another.\"  So she went to the kitchen and had them make me a fresh fish sandwich.  The second try was perfect, as perfect as perfect can get at a fast food joint. Crispy, piping hot with normal amounts of topping. I was happy. Thank you Latoya for your excellent customer service.  You get 5 stars from me. You deserve recognition!  I hope your employer sees this and praises you for your good customer service skills.  Keep up the good work. No matter where you work or what you do, if you do it right you will go far."}
{"text":"I love love love Lynette! She was super friendly and kind! AND what I got my chicken fries they had smiley faces on the box. It's the little things that matter most!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but Super slow! Didn't get my good until 20 min after ordering. Wouldnt come here again!"}
{"text":"Amazingly the worse buger King on the planet. Crew members seem to all move in suspended animation. As if their stuck in first gear, or neutral. Nevermind them responding. Attempted to get Dr. Pepper from the soda machine and ended up with soda all over my new white shirt. Tried to get the attention of the manager ( a 20 minute wait) to inform her the machine is malfunctioning, and didn't even get an apology for my ruined shirt! Would rate this place a zero if possible"}
{"text":"Asked if they had the veggie burger (morning star veggie patty) she said yes. Told us it would cost more at $2.49 said that's fine .. end up getting a burger with just some veggies in it !!! You ask me to pay a higher price & then don't even put the patty in it ?!?!!?"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy BurgerKing and it was my top pick out of all the fastfood burger joints. But when I entered this place one time after a long day and just wanted a quick bite, never again!!!! All there food was so oversalted that I had to spit it out again, specially the poutine! Never again am I entering foot into this location or for that matter will avoid BurgerKing."}
{"text":"Number 15 Burger King foot letus. The last thing you want in your burger king burger is someone else's foot fungus."}
{"text":"Horrible place!!! There is no one making the food, only one receptionist and more than 20 people are waiting!!! Seriously, the worst and slowest FAST FOOD place"}
{"text":"To be honest we got a good service good good food spicy chicken sandwich we wait 5 minutes in super ok with that at least I know is made to order ...lol bread is really good Hot sauce could be a bit better."}
{"text":"Ok seriously cash only what up wtf... On this modern world ...what ever .in this part of town all  pay cash and ways lol"}
{"text":"Komme selten zu Burger King und wenn, dann ist es meistens der in Landsberg (max. 5 Mal pro Jahr). Das Essen ist bis auf ein paar kleine Ausrutscher geschmacklich gut.  Die Temperatur des Essens könnte etwas höher sein.  Sehr enttäuscht war ich vom Service. Bei jedem meiner Besuche dieses Jahr konnten die Mitarbeiter an der Theke kaum deutsch und sprachen selbst natürlich auch sehr undeutlich, schnell und leise. Desweiteren gab es bei jeder Bestellung dieses Jahr Probleme. Es fehlte immer mindestens eine Sache, die ich bestellt hatte, egal ob bei Verzehrt im Restaurant oder bei Mitnahme.  Zu guter Letzt viel mein Burger dann nach 2 Mal in die Hand nehmen komplett auseinander und ich konnte alle Zutaten extra vom Tablett essen, was natürlich nervig ist weil man dann alles an den Händen kleben hat.  Alles in allem kann ich hier leider nur einen Stern geben und dieser gilt vor allem dem Restaurant an sich, was ziemlich modern und schön gestaltet ist.  Schade!"}
{"text":"Warning - their drive thru combo signage is incorrect. I ordered a #7 combo which should have been a Whopper Jr., fires, and drink, for under $6. What they gave me was a bacon BBQ Whopper combo, almost $9. They refused to swap for what I wanted because they prepared a #7. The food it itself isn't horrible, but there was no one in the drive-thru line with me and few cars in the lot, so I don't understand their reluctance to change my order. If I ever go back, I will not use the drive thru."}
{"text":"Spent too long explaining my order, correcting the cashier while the manager yelled to the back our order incorrectly. Then we still did not get our order as asked. Only one of the two soda fountains worked with a low ice machine. None of the tables were clean."}
{"text":"First I'm pretty sure I ordered the ultimate bacon burger combo. They gave me a whopper with cheese. I said no onion. The corrected sandwich not only had onion, but only had so tiny looking bacon slices, and a squirt of ketchup. The people were rude, the guy who brought my sandwich out practically threw it at me, and forgot my fries. I had to go back inside for them. This is freaking ridiculous."}
{"text":"They have the best chocolate shake! Love the fries and the meat in the whoppers and the chicken sandwiches are the best ever"}
{"text":"It's to bad management doesn't properly train their employees to be honest and remember that this is Burger King \" I get it my way\". When crispy fries are ordered it doesn't mean put new fries down and pass them off as crispy."}
{"text":"I don't usually bother writing a review about fast food places but this time I will.   Had a whopper combo, fries were old and cold and looked like they just threw the burger in a wrapper, total mess. Was surrounded by dirty tables and very outdated decor.  Worst part is I got a mild case of food poisoning, been feeling sick for a few days.  Completely turned off Burger King"}
{"text":"Okk so what do I expect, it's a fast food joint. My Veggie Burger pattie was so tuff I thought about tossing it to the dog as a chew toy. So I asked for another one. Here is the result. But I must say the lead manager was working really hard handling drive thru, walk-ups and dine in orders. Btw I don't use a microwave at home I don't want my veggie burger nuked."}
{"text":"Hungry and short on time as we try to catch our flight back home to Sunny SD!  We wanted a quick order and run, but ended up being a slow order and then RUN to our gate.  I got the big king, and may be the equivalent to the McD's big mack but without the great taste of the Big Mac.  The BK fries are always good cause they are thick cut."}
{"text":"Not sure where that hair on the seat came from, but given its curly nature I'm a bit worried.  Yuck.  And I noticed this halfway through my meal.  Many tables/seats not cleaned here.  Food took longer than usual.  Bleh."}
{"text":"Manager seems to work the front register and she does an amazing job!  I'm sick and tired of having my rather simple order screwed up, or have to endure a cashier who cannot enter just one modification to a meal item.  This place is clean too, always, and especially breakfast hours.  This location has pancakes too, which is nice.  There's also the play area for kids.  Parking is decent.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Slow service, dirty dining area, medicore food.  Not one of the better BK's in the Scottsdale area.  Play area for kids is decent though."}
{"text":"I have given this burger king a chance MANY times... But they are BY FAR the slowest burger king I have EVER been to... Even if they have no customers inside, and you go through the empty drive through, they will STILL make you pull forward and wait for your meal, one time it was over a half hour! Absolutely unreasonable."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I just went in a few min ago, I was first in line and waited 5 min for someone, anyone to acknowledge me and take my order. Lots of people behind the counter. All apparently waiting on drive thru customers. Not one employee to work the counter and serve the walk in customers. So, they did not get my business, I just left and will never go back. They don't want my money? They won't get it."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Very long line and long wait. They were more worried about serving the drive thru than anything else. Inside and outside the resturaunt was filthy. Staff completely unmotivated. Burger King should be embarrased this location is even open."}
{"text":"Burger King in general is a decent 3 Star fast food chain. The main problem with this location is the prices. As all places in the airport, this place demands $13 for a meal. Not a huge fan of the crazy markups that are at airports and thus gets a 2 Star. Service was fine, but the staff that gave your food seemed a little annoyed all the time and she never acknowledges when you say thank you. The cashier was a good friendly guy however."}
{"text":"Solo es una cuestión de preferencia, porque es rica la hamburguesa dw acá y el pollo también. El churrasquito la rompe y para los mas hambrientos x no decirles gordos tienen lamopción esa de doble stacker triple stacker e ir agrandando así tipo hasta un maximo de hamburguesa. Me parece extrwmo pero hay a quien le copa. Yo me quedo toda la vida con la M, pero este para vender tiene promos barbaras en los diarios revistas onlines, donde quieras."}
{"text":"Horrible HORRIBLE Customer Service!!! I have never experienced anything, like what I did today. Pull up to the drive-thru, I asked 4 times, anyone there????  No response. This should have been my clue but instead I backed out of the drive-thru and walked in. The store manager, drive thru operator were in the dine-in area having personal chit chat. I asked the lady at the register, was the drive thru broken. Her response, I don't know what going on with that. I placed my order, only one customer was ahead of me. 10- 15 mins later, I still have not received my order. When I questioned what was taking so long, the only response I received was, company policy Drive-thru customers come first. I told the lady, well I tried the drive-thru but no one would take my order. After hearing so many stupid excuses, I asked for my money back. The store manager had a attitude. Then says \"Its people like you, that makes me wanna walk out of this place\" then kept giving crazy looks as she was refunding me my money. To anyone reading this, save your time and money and go to another place to eat. I learned my lesson!!!!"}
{"text":"Drive through lady? Shit attitude. Will NOT be coming back to this Burger King if I even ever eat at Burger King again. Wouldn't even let me use my coupon because she \"didn't feel like re- putting in my order\" for a 5-piece French toast when I was the ONLY ONE in the drive through and nobody was in the restaurant. yeah no. If I wasn't in a pinch for time, I would have just gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"You know, it's been years since I ate at Burger KIng. I loved this place when I was younger and I can say it certainly contributed to me being as big as a house. I loved their sausage croissants and whoppers, but as I grew older, the whoppers became smaller and of course, more expensive. I think the last time I ate at BK was in Madrid in 2003.  Anyway, with coupon in hand I sent the boy to pick up something to nosh on for lunch. I was incited however not by having a 2 for 1 coupon but on the new fries featured in their new commercial. Glad I did. The fries were great They are thicker which I love,  they were hot , maybe a little too much salt. That's it.   The Whopper was delicious and brought me back to my high school days in Passaic NJ where I could put down two of those bad boys. It was hot, fresh and a perfect blend of mayo, mustard and ketchup. As a double whopper is could have been wonderful, but the single was satisfying.   I guess I I have come full circle. I'll be back Mr. Burger King."}
{"text":"Its a typical fast food restaurant. Its very clean in the mornings when I arrive.  Today I decided to write a review as I watched the manager and her staff dance around asking a homeless women to leave their parking lot.   Now she wasnt bothering anyone. I saw her when I arrived and watched her from my seat and she was just sitting in the shade of the building and wasnt begging for change or hand outs.  The employees said she is gross but since she bought a coffee we cant ask her to leave for at least an hour. Ive been here dressed in my business casual for more than an hour and nobody has looked at me with the same disgust or approached me to say its time for me to go.  The food is typical and as long as you are employed I guess you will be treated like a regular citizen worthy of a whopper with cheese."}
{"text":"Very nice morning crew. Was very helpful and pleasant with me since it was taking me so long to figure out what I wanted (im a mcdonalds breakfast guy) well done Burger king well done. But I did forget the cina rolls. I guess I will have to go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"It's called fast food. Not wait for three hours for a fricking burger food. WTF  how hard is it honestly?"}
{"text":"I received a coupon in the mail at my home & this location was the closest.  Interestingly enough they wouldn't accept the coupon, said they don't honor coupons...bad customer service I would say. Giving this location 1 star only because Yelp required it to post my review."}
{"text":"Slowest.service.ever... It doesn't matter if you're ordering one item or twenty it will take you at least 15 min to get thru when there is no one else in line! They have over 4 employees working, no customers and yet it takes forever to place your order and GET your food. They always apologize about the wait and yet do nothing to fix it. To top it you see them moving at a snails pace and don't acknowledge you just stand there... Ugh! So frustrating! Avoid this place as much as possible"}
{"text":"This place sucks. I mean Burger King is what it is, but the customer service was a nightmare. Went on several occasions hoping for a different outcome and each time I had to wait more than 10 minutes for \"Fast Food\". Meanwhile the employees were just hanging around. I'm not going back to that place and strongly recommend to find somewhere else if you're considering this place.  Otherwise good luck!"}
{"text":"Never going to this restaurant again literally everything in our order was off. Both drinks where flat not a little flat but a disgusting flat out burgers where slappped together like it was garbage the fries tasted disgusting they haven't changed the oil for what seems like ever they wanted to give us one ranch sauce when we ordered 4 meals they kid toys I asked for not toys they got girl toys the chick fingers looks super old and stale, they added way to much mayo on both burgers just wow. I was super nice and said please and thank you also when I was ordering the guy taking orders just stopped replying I had to ask if he was there listing this place has the worst customer service iv ever seen and the most garbage food iv ever tasted I will never come here again"}
{"text":"The worst case of customer service ever. I have came here often and its horrible. The staff has the worst attitude, it takes extremely long and they don't pay attention"}
{"text":"what kind of a burger king does not serve Chicken Sandwich!!!! This is like the only burger kind ive been so far that only serves one type of chicken sandwich in two style...crispy or grill...whatever happen to the fish or the orignal chicken sandwich? what a disappointment..."}
{"text":"I went to this Burger King on my meal break for the first time one day and everything was decent and tasty. I got the Whopper value meal. Then, I went again and it was a different story. They were very slow, VERY SLOWWWW. I was the only customer in the entire place and still waited a long time to get my food. Then when I got my food, my Whopper was dripping wet. Like a cup of water mixed condiments was poured on the burger. It was soaked and dripped with each bite. I picked up the bread to inspect why my burger is raining and there appeared to be a puddle on the burger itself, no joke. Not only that, the outside of the bread was covered with smeared ketchup, like it was smeared on with someone's fingers, after dropping it. At this point I was angry. But didn't have enough time to complain and get a refund, due to my short break, plus I was freaked out by the workers. The supervisor and workers seemed confused, not bright, and disgruntled with customers. They were complaining to each other the whole time I sat there. I will NEVER go there again and will warn anyone who thinks of going there. That was the worst fast food experience I ever had in my life and I love Burger King. If you want a surprise burger, go to this BK. If want extra slow service, eat on Sardis Road in general. If you want extra extra slow service, go to this Burger King."}
{"text":"This BK has always been busy  and the drive through always packed.  I think the design of the building is more conducive to the drive thru especially since the parking feels like a death trap.  The inside is kept clean, sometimes the line on the inside is just as long as the drive through line wrapping around the building."}
{"text":"Luckily I don't mind Coke....  I have been here several times and it's been... \"meh\"... but the last time I came through the drive thru and ordered a simple Medium #1 with onion rings.  I thought it was strange that the order taker did not ask what I wanted to drink, but just drove around (figured he would ask me when I got there).... NOPE just handed me a coke.  I try to roll with the punches more-often-than-not, but this was not the end of the world for me.  When I opened the bag, I had fries... and mentioned it to him.  There was no apology and he just went and got the onion rings and handed me the bag back.  I guess  the phrase, \"you get what you pay for\" applies here.  I will probably give this place another shot since it's right near my house when I need a BK fix, but this is very disappointing in my book."}
{"text":"I felt like a farm animal ordering and waiting for my food in the morning before my flight, but I can't complain since it was only a quick minute of my life.  The food came out fast and hot as expected and it definitely gave me what I was looking for to start the morning.  Having to get through security that early in the morning, I just wanted something in my stomach to start the day.  For the airport, it's good to have a fast food place located inside of it depending on your situation and how fast you need to eat.  At the same time, I wish \"fast\" did not equate to \"poorer quality\"... I guess Europeans have it right when they take their time eating their meals...."}
{"text":"I typically avoid fast food places but I was out running an errand on my lunch hour on the north side of town and needed something quick so I stopped here thinking it wouldn't be very busy.  This Burger King is attached to a Shell gas station and convenience store at the northwest corner of the junction of I-77 and Nations Ford Rd.  The restaurant has a bit of a retro design to it which you will first notice at the drive-thru.  Inside, there are stainless steel tables as well as bar stools and dividers with the retro/deco theme.  It's been a long time since I've been in a BK and I see it's not jus burgers and fries anymore.  There are chicken options as well and specialty sandwiches.  One of the things I always loved about BK is the onion rings option instead of just fries.  The food here was actually decent for a fast food joint.  My grilled chipotle chicken sandwich was tasty despite needed a little more chipotle flavor.  They even have special sauce for your onion rings.  The staff here was friendly for a fast food place.  Nothing exceptional but I have been to far worse places."}
{"text":"On our way back from the library, I noticed Smashburger on the right.  Wanna try it? I asked Lucinda. it's a restaurant/fast food hybrid.  Wouldn't you know it, the order taker stalked up with a forceful stride and demanded to know if we were eating in or taking out.  We barely had a chance to glance at the menu.  Why is it so fucking important to know that right away?  Why shout??  She needed to make herself heard over the blaring pop tunes blasting.  Why not just say, in a polite tone:  Hi.  Let me know when you're ready to order.  In less than 30 seconds I decided it would be a struggle to enjoy the Smashburger experience.  Lucinda agreed.  We headed down the street to Burger King.  Play it safe and order from the drive-thru.  Less chance to be irked.  A friendly gal named \"Baby\" believe it or not helped us.  \"Baby\" is the superstar who makes this venue worth a visit.  Not to slam the youngsters, but Baby puts her heart into her job, doesn't act like it's beneath her the way so many sullen youngsters do.  I fell for the A-1 special cheese burger supposedly served on a \"warm, toasted, Artisan bun.\"  Here's a tip:  Don't fall for these gimmicks.  Their tried & true standard bun is far better.    Lucinda wisely chose the Whopper with cheese & bacon.  A very dependable selection.  Way better than the A-1 special.    Don't bother to say \"no onions.\"  Just pick 'em off."}
{"text":"Ordered French toast sticks this morning and not Only did I receive the French toast sticks I was provided with someone's hair.    Tossed out the rest of the food and left."}
{"text":"10+mins for a double cheese burger and after all that ice cold fries.  No dipping sauces for the nuggets. The only thing fast moving was the napkin dispenser  The struggle was real today there"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Friendly, clean and close to home! Beats the Golden Arches any day!!"}
{"text":"Worst drive through experience, will avoid this place at all cost. Rude and unprofessional workers, food was eh and fries were cold."}
{"text":"Everytime we go here. . shame on us..   always the same.   Orders are never correct for take out.    Ordered the Grilled tender chicken sandwhich and a salad.   Got a Chicken burger patty instead with absolutely nothing on it.    I threw it away after the first bite.   The salad had and one single slice of a tomato on it with a clump of grated orange cheese atop.   It was fresh but a bowl of lettuce when you expect a salad is not acceptable.   I won't be tempted to go here for a fast meal again.  I swear they just toss anything in the to go bag!    Beware!"}
{"text":"The quality is typical of BK, maybe a little better than another I've gone to in the area. The staff is very friendly, and the pricing is typical slightly expensive as you expect from BK - I will say this location hasn't ripped me off with the fries though, many Burger Kings will fill a large (which is pretty small in the first place for fast food \"large\") barely halfway, this one fills it up proper.  I do experience some waits/being asked to park in front and wait a few minutes for them to cook my food up - but that's because I only come here at strange hours and typically order things that need frying like nuggets or chicken fingers. In fact that wait time just means I'm getting something more recently prepared so I don't mind at all having fresh fries.  It's a Burger King, if you don't like fast food then don't whine about that in a review, review the location and experience - not \"I want vegan soy tofu for dinner so this place sucks\"."}
{"text":"we were in the drive thru waiting for our ordered then the lady said \"do we need help\" (obviously) then rhe lady who swiped our cards was so rude. Our coffees are horrible and we asked for ketchup and didn't get any."}
{"text":"This place is just out right disgusting. Every time I come here, (which isn't often only because it's convenient) there's always problems. I swear it really depends who's working because employees here are mostly rude. I never feel welcomed. I highly suggest you order your food \" off the broiler \" otherwise it's gonna be old. Don't even get me started on when they tell you to pull around and wait 20 mins for food. What's going on at this location? I might as well go to the Durango location down the street."}
{"text":"Cheesy Tots are back.   Which means I will be be an avid visitor of Burger King while they last. I remember I was a sad panda a few years ago when they took them off the menu.  There is just something about the ooey gooey cheesy inside, and the crunchy exterior.  Also, if you didn't know Burger King has a buy one whopper, get one for $0.55 in celebration of thier anniversary. When it comes to fast food chains, I am a whopper kind of girl. The \"flame broiled\" taste wins me over every time.  This location is typically fast and very accomodating.  Due to the location you will see plenty of hookers, homeless and panhandlers outside the parking lot. Don't be surprised."}
{"text":"I don't really have any gripes about this location.   Everytime I order a \"happy meal\" they never correct me, simply give me what I want. I always feel a bit stupid afterwards but hey, it's an honest mistake.  They are pretty fast in the drive through and almost always clean on the inside. I always get please and thank you from the employees here too."}
{"text":"This Burger King is awful on so many levels.  First of all, the service can be glacially slow, especially when you dine in.  Secondly, the ICEE machine is almost always broken. It got to the point where it was almost a surprise when it was working. This especially made me mad because my wife loves the Coke ICEES and we used to go here just to get them.  Thirdly, the management has displayed \"motivational\" signs chock full of spelling errors within view of guests. If I was an employee, I would actually be demotivated by these posters.  Maybe the incompetence displayed by the Wal-Mart right across the parking lot has creeped over to the Burger King? In any case, there are many other better Burger Kings around the area that deserve your business."}
{"text":"This place is so awful. I feel bad for the Burger King...he's going to kick this place out of the kingdom. It's almost like a rogue estate or a province in revolt or something...  I have been here multiple times, and something is ALWAYS broken or out of stock.   Once, I think that we tried to use a coupon, but the manager was gone or something and we couldn't use it.   When I went there today, I pulled up and saw that they had an advertisement for Cheesy Tots on the screen. I thought that they had gotten rid of those a few months ago, but then I figured that they may have brought them back or something. Well, when I ordered them, they said they didn't carry them. I said that they had an advertisement on the screen for them, and they repeated once again they didn't have them. Neither time did I receive an apology! Of course, the Coke ICEE machine was broken, and of course they didn't apologize about that either.   I doubt I'll go here again...McDonald's is much better...this place is easily the worst place in Steelyard Commons by far."}
{"text":"The Burger Kings that are located in the Cleveland area must be part of some rebellious state in the Burger King's kingdom or something, because this is yet another awful Burger King in this area. Sad, too, because I generally enjoy eating at Burger King.  If I had a nickel for every time I've come here in the hopes of getting a Coke Icee (one of Sheila F.'s favorite drinks) only to be told that the machine is broken, I'd have enough money to buy a Coke Icee machine of my own for use at home.  The service is slow here too; I have probably widened the hole in the ozone layer by at least one foot with the emissions that I've spewed into the air while waiting in this line.   I would love never to have to go here again in the future. With a well-run McDonald's and Subway located nearby, there are many other better options available for fast food in this area."}
{"text":"I'm giving it three stars because the service at this place is abysmally slow. The food is great, of course, but it takes far too long to get your food. I thought the entire idea behind fast food is that it's fast? I was going to give it two stars but then I remembered that the ICEE machine always works, which is more than can be said for other establishments around here.  When there are no cars in the drive-through line and I pull up to place an order, it shouldn't take 5 minutes to get it to me once I'm at the window, especially when I don't order anything out of the ordinary. This happens almost every time I go! Honestly, this place is starting to bring back memories of the old McDonald's by Case. I always brought a newspaper in when I went there because it could take up to 10 minutes to get your food at times. Guess what happened to that location? It closed! Let's hope that the management of this Burger King takes a look down Euclid, sees what happens to inefficient establishments, and starts making things run more quickly."}
{"text":"Probably only been to this BK location 5 times in the past 8 years, but customer service has always been good.   When I was a kid I remember really liking their Chicken Sandwiches, before BK rolled out variations of them. Maybe last year I ordered it again when I finally used one of their coupons that found its way into my mailbox with all the junk mails destined for recycling. It just wasn't the same at all, and noticeably more salty.  Anyway, I was being lazy and decided to stop here on the way home and took a crack at their current $5 Mixed and Match promo (ordered the Big Fish and Grilled Chicken, glad the man who took my order told me about my choices since I was just going to order what I saw on their promo ad). Not the greatest but good for the price tag.  I also ordered their Mocha Iced Coffee. That was the only disappointment for me. It was tiny relative to the ones I tried recently from McD but most importantly the taste a dud. Definitely crossing off BK from all future iced coffee run list of providers.  So quick recap:  Good service I don't like their Iced Coffee Whopper, Chicken Sandwich not as good as I had remembered as a kid, but I did like their BK Big Fish  Interesting Note: This BK is not the biggest, but they have the biggest parking lot!"}
{"text":"Super fast service! The guy who gave me my food was very nice and processional.  My new favorite burger King."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them no stars.  I arrived at 8:07 to discover the doors had been locked to the restaurant and the drive thru was shut down. No one responded to phone calls and there were people hiding out in the kitchen.   Real professional, folks."}
{"text":"So I stopped by through the drive thru to get a whopper jr meal . They failed to tell me they ran out of ketchup which neccisarely isn't a huge deal but they were definitely aware and choose not to tell the customer but the real issue is the lack of customer . The girl who handed me the order literally when i asked her if I could have ketchup packets she was like \"i dont think we have any and proceeded to look and yell hey do we have any ketchup the manager was like we dont she then was like we dont have any ketchup and slams the window door like hello thats rude ass hell . Atleast seem a  tad bit apologetic"}
{"text":"once again icee machine is down per usual..! everytime i come here this happens, mind you it's 100 degree weather right now, do not come here for icee machine go to 7-11"}
{"text":"Not sure if there was a management change since theses other reviews were posted, but for the past 6-9 months I've frequented this location at least biweekly and I've always had great customer service. Food is fresh, service even better. I'll be back. Anyone who has previously had a bad experience here should try it again, you're likely to be surprised."}
{"text":"Food is alright asfar as a BK goes. Relatively clean inside. Not usually a long wait for orders to be ready.  But the staff. Some of the rudest, most miserable people I've ever meant in my life. Between the wannabe tough teenagers and the dopey aimless adults, make your interactions here as brief as possible. The staff can't be bothered to do anything."}
{"text":"Worst service and lied about size of mocha Joe... Clearly small cup but saying its medium not only the staff but also the manager..."}
{"text":"Not as bad as the reviews make it seem.   Was hesitant to go here per the bad reviews, but it really was a normal experience.   We visited this location after 8pm.  Used the drive-thru.  Employees were nice.  Food was decent taste & temperature. Wait was longer than we would have liked but the food was hot, so they must have just made it.   Overall, not that bad. Pretty normal."}
{"text":"I was never really a fan of Burger King. I used to like their Original Chicken Sandwich, but now it just does not taste as good as it used to. The only reason why I come here is because my husband likes the Double Croissan'wich and Hash Browns on the breakfast menu.  This Burger King is located in the Rainbow Dunes Centre and is not very hard to spot since it is the only business left in this area. Looks like there used to be a buffet, hair salon, a shoe store and more that have all sadly closed down due to the bad economy.  I have never been inside, but the drive-thru service is always pretty good. The employees are pretty nice and they have not messed up any of my orders yet. One thing that is nice is that they always seem to make a fresh batch of hash browns when you order them. They make you wait for a while, but they are still hot after I get home!  It's too bad that I only like 2 items on their menu."}
{"text":"Death served with vomit and an ER visit.  This place will murder you, I just got through with a lengthy visit with a local ER with my entire family after they ate this death food. They are so sick they can't stand. Everyone that ate a burger is bed ridden and it has turned a whole family into a horror film. Vincent Price couldn't make this up. They are so sick they had to be driven to the ER and then wheeled one by one into the hospital. I am worried to the point of hand wringing. Did they have intercourse with the burgers? Did they summon them from the 666th level of hell with some necronomicon just to serve them to unsuspecting customers? What is going on? The health department has been notified due to process, but if I lose one of my family members due to this, it will be on fuggin CNN.  This place is not on Yelp, but it is now. Thanks to yours truly!   AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE IT IS A NIGERIAN HOOKER WITH AIDS!  My 93 year old father is now being admitted to the hospital over their food. He may die. And if he does I will own this place and turn it into a Trump fan center in the middle of Maryvale Arizona. I may play the Star and Stripes Forever from a 10000 Watt PA from the rooftop until someone burns it down...then I will cash in the insurance and move far, far, far away with whatever family lives.   Do not eat here. This isn't a joke. Just don't. They must be wiping their feet with the meat or something. It will kill you deader that a door knob. If I could show you a picture of a whole family laying around like the last act in Hamlet you would know what I mean. This place will kill you. Not figuratively, I am talking for real. This place will kill you and your family and then go home and eat some TV dinner while watching a novella. A hand to god this is the truth.  I stopped eating fast food years ago, you might want to think about being a picky douche like myself and start cooking at home. These places are run by people who couldn't cut it at anything else. Dig??!?!?!?"}
{"text":"The worst BK in all of Allegheny County. Food is usually old or undercooked; and the building itself seems sooty on the inside and the outside. Kinda surprised it's still open."}
{"text":"Very rude and unfriendly employees.  Waited for my food and nothing.   After 15 min I asked for it and they tried to hand me the wrong order.  They had to redo mine and then tossed me the bag with out the entire order.  I then had to get assertive to get the rest of my order and that bag was tossed at me with no have a good day or sort for the hassle.  Might want to change your attitudes"}
{"text":"Last time I was here, it was alright. The fries were good, chicken fries were hard, and the new Mac n Cheetos tasted like they'd been sitting out for an hour before being served. I decided I'd try again because I'd heard these things were actually really good and maybe I'd just had some bad luck. I was right. This time my Mac n Cheetos were warm, fresh, and delicious! The service through the drive-through was spectacular and it didn't take too long."}
{"text":"This is just terrible. Not only have they almost doubled the prices of almost every other Burger King as well as expecting you to pay tax, but they don't even have the full menu. Despite being unhappy about the price, I opted for a substitute, that should have been good- it had onion rings, bacon and BBQ sauce.  My bun was a bit burnt and the flavors all bland. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"This Burger King actually is very nice! The person who took our order did a great job and it was ready quickly and the food looked good. It tasted good and all was well....   until someone started having this loud phone conversation with someone about what sandwich they wanted. It really got unbelievable that so much loud conversation and rudeness was happening so emphatically and so loudly for so long about sandwiches and it was preposterous why no agreement could be come upon! It was some foolish employee leaning over the counter from inside buger king yelling into her phone and using profanity. I know it isn't some 5 star restaurant but please don't yell profanities while I eat."}
{"text":"I would give negative stars if I could.  It's been YEARS since I've had Burger King; I decided to stop by to try their new spicy chicken nuggets.  The nuggets tasted like oil! Not spicy at all.  I got a Dr. Pepper to drink and it was flat.   To top it off, the ladies that work there are rude.  The gentle man that took our order was nice.   I will not visit this place again."}
{"text":"Food is fowl, but that's nothing surprising. The cashier that rang my order up Meisha or something like that, black American female was horrible. First second she saw me, with me being white and I open carry, she rolls her eyes at me, not once would she make eye contact with. Acted like she could careless to be here absolutely no customer service at all. Looks straight out of prison. If you are white avoid this place. The Hispanic female was very kind to me and all other customers though."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for buy one whopper and get one free so I ordered a large fry also and it totaled $8.28. The fries were hot but not the best and the burger was pre- made. Luke warm at best. Service was ok at the drive thru. I guess $4.14 per person for a hamburger n fries is not bad but wished the hamburger was not sitting under a heat lamp but freshly made."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently visited her 97 year old mom at a hospice center near this Burger King. After our visit we were both starving and went to this Burger King with a coupon we received in the mail. It was for 2 Whopper JRs and 2 small fries for $3.99. Not a bad deal! When we got to the window to receive our order we were told the fries were not ready and to pull into the parking lot. They would bring our order out to us. So I complied. Maybe 3-4 min later (didn't get his name) brought us 2 full sized whoppers and 2 large French fries and apologized for the inconvenience. The burgers were hot and freshly made as were the fries. I'm so glad because it kept my wife buried in her meal instead of telling me how to drive all the way home!  Ha ha Thank you Burger King!!!"}
{"text":"Well, there's not much to say except that it's Burger king. Pretty standard on everything, we go here for their predictability.  Location is a tad shady though, not overly bad but around the corner is a strip mall that looks sketchy.  What cost them a star is they were out of cookies....  Other than that it was a typical Burger king dining experience in all it's glory."}
{"text":"I went in and ordered some Chicken Sandwich's. I got home and looky here I got whopper Jr.'s. I didnt mind as I made it work. But I feel bad for the person who ordered a Whopper Jr. and got a Chicken Sandwich."}
{"text":"The most simple of tasks, generally accomplished with minimal energy and intelligence, for the small price of a buck and change is all I ask.  The burger I bought (a double cheese burger with no ketchup or mustard) came out not only loaded with both, but also a simple lesson in failed geometry.  If the one slice of cheese is going to be ripped in half fine but at least put it in the center of the burger.  That's correct, one slice of cheese ripped in half, hanging off to the side like a saddlebag.  High school drop outs claim they will never need to use math.  yes.  yes you do. Even at burger king.  Take note kids and stay in school.  Anyhow, I drive back to return the burger and tell the manager.  She goes into the back, makes the burger again with no apology only to \"check my food before I leave next time\"  So I guess I'm the asshole here?  When I did open it up in the car on the way back the burger was lukewarm at best.  Clearly no one gives a shit.  Don't worry burger king, the under two dollar purchase will not leave me homeless or ruin my investment portfolio.  I only come here every 4 to 5 months when for some reason I think \"no, they won't get my order wrong again or fail to turn the air conditioningon above 90.  seriously, it is like a goddamn sauna in there all the time.  I hope there is a prince in this line of burger king royalty that will step up to the throne."}
{"text":"This location is without a doubt the most awful Burger King I have ever been to, including truck stops.  The employees at this location are the biggest festival of douch bags I have ever had the displeasure of being around.  Let me enlighten you with my two part story.  The first time I went to this location, I went through the drive thru.  Getting home, I now know the pain of Leo Gets in the movie Lethal weapon 2, and symphatize with him in his stance of how they always fuck you at the drive thru.  I get back home to realize I am a pawn in Burger Kings game of fucking their customers at the drive thru.  I drive back, let them know my order was wrong.  The manager looks in my bag, goes back and talks to the cook.  They forgot about me and 10 minutes later I remind him I am still waiting for my order.  He brings out a bag and drops about 6 inches on the counter in front of me.  Doesn't say a word.  I suppose this was my fault.  Pencildickmanager looked at me as it was.  O.K., perhaps they were having a day.  Perhaps I should have looked at my food when I left.   Regardless, I hope the manager is reading this.  If you are, your a dick (yes, you.  The fat guy)   Part two, which I have entitled: Tempting fate, I decide to go back to this restaurant once again.  I should have stuck with my intuition, like when a dog knows it is about to storm and starts barking and acting weird.  Sitting in the \"dining room\" this time (although the amount of garbage in the room resembled more what I think the threshold to hell would look like)  I think the only place that didn't have garbage in it was the trash cans.  My food was not only incorrect, but tasted like what I can only describe as, well, for a lack of a better word..... dogshit.  I think my hamburger patty was awake longer than I was and had the texture of a belt.  I wouldn't even let my dogs eat this trainwreck of a \"meal.\"  I told the kid who reminded me of Rainman working the counter that the burgers were pretty bad and he might want to cook some fresh ones.  He just started at me like he saw a pair of tits for the first time.  I don't think this kid will strive to be a member of the space program.    I will never go back to this store and I hope someone who works there reads this.  Although I doubt that.  I think they are spending more time standing around thinking of ways they can piss off their customers and be generally non-productive.  I can only become religious and pray that if I ever have kids, they are smarter then the staff at this burger king.    Much like the old lady in the movie Poltergeist, I give you a warning, Caroline.  Stay away from here, this is Satan's Burger King."}
{"text":"Went here the other day and had zero problems.got the wopper meal with cheese. Traded frys for onion rings and a large drink everything was good and had a good experience. Staff was friendly and nice I don't eat at Bk a lot but I would come back."}
{"text":"Order accuracy is terrible.  1 sauce for 20 nuggets...seriously??  food okay...check order before you walk out the door."}
{"text":"This location is inside the Belz (Las Vegas Premium Outlet South) Outlet in one of the food courts there.    There are not any food options at the two different food courts at this outlet mall.  This Burger King is the best option when it comes to having a meal here.  It is not one of the best Burger King locations that I have been to.  The menu is the same as the other BK's.  When you come to this outlet, try to make sure that you eat something first.  If you're really hungry, then this is your best bet."}
{"text":"This location is ok. Staff is grumpy, and the food is eh.  Burger came on a small bun- not normal sized bun.  Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"I normally reserve ratings such as these for more of a sit down restaurant type place, but I've been to this location quite a few times and the service is amazing!  Obviously the food is fast food so there isn't anything special there, though I seem to get fresh fries etc. quite often. As with many new establishments, they have a TV that has the news on it which is convenient for catching up on things while you wait, though I've never really had a very long wait.   The people there could represent BK in a commercial though.  Super friendly and helpful from their whole staff, and actually kind of made you feel like you were part of a community, which granted its Cave Creek so it is a smaller town, but generally you don't get that feeling from one of the largest fast food chains in the country.  I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and it has always been a pleasure.  Just FYI, I never go through the drive thru (in any place I go pretty much) so this is just my experience from waiting inside.  Maybe I've been lucky, but my food is always hot and fresh.  The workers have always been very nice and make you want to come back.  It isn't the newest interior, but not the oldest either."}
{"text":"Yikes, Try another place-  Drive Thru is only allowed 1 Order, Even when there is no one behind you.  Once in awhile you get a Good Worker, (Gay) She was great. Sad to see shes gone. She was so great with my Grandfather when he would come in.   Maria used to be Nice, Now she just makes fun out of the customers in Spanish with another co worker.  Several times my Order was in-correct, One time because they were having a good time laughing and making fun out of an Older Women and her big husband.  Another time I was in with my Nephew and I noticed Discount tires getting free food.  It has gotten so bad we just drive to Gilbert and Southern.  Sucks because I live behind the post office And work at Safeway.  Just to tell you how long I been going here. I remember them selling Dollar Whoppers for nearly 2 years straight. That had to be over 10 years ago.  Nice Remodeling Job. Now remodel the staff =D Starting with Maria.       Gilbert and Southern are so respectful and professional."}
{"text":"This place should have higher reviews. Well I bring the entire family here and never have any issues. I rather come here then go to the Burger King Right across the street from my House.   Excellent Service.  Great Staff.  Drive Thru is awesome.  Very Clean!"}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could.  My family came here for lunch and my son and I had the 5 for $4(or whatever) deal while my husband had a combo meal.  By the end of the night my son and I were violently sick.  There was no indication that we would have gotten sick by any other means."}
{"text":"It's Burger King, no more no less. Consistent meal at a bargain price. We have been taking advantage of the two whopper meal deals and have had good friendly service over the summer.  Today, like we usually do, we added cheese to the deal for $1 more. Yeah it's a dollar, but we like cheese.   3-4 bites in the whopper we notice something missing - the cheese! We informed the front counter, and rather than say giving us a slice of cheese or saying bring your burger back so we can put it on - the immediately ordered 2 new whoppers at no charge (they didn't want the original ones back.   Classy!! Remake the food properly.  Kuddos BK, quality move.  (And we were stuffed - couldn't eat any moe of the original whoppers."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this BK for years now.  I have been to many others around town as well since BK is my favorite burger joint for fast food.  But this one for the drive thru outshines them all.  I never go inside just drive thru but they NEVER get my special orders wrong and the staff is very nice all the time.  I am sure the chefs in the back must have been there for a long time because the food is always good and I see a lot of same faces at the drive thru window.  So my guess is the management must be good at this one as well.  I highly recommend this BK for the fast and kind drive thru."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town.  I had a good experience at this location. 8am... Friendly staff, food consistent with all locations, and clean dining room."}
{"text":"Skip this one, and go to the one up the road (Val Vista) near Home Depot.  Could be the same owners, for all I know.  This one is dirty and will screw up your order every time.  But they make up for it by serving it COLD!  They just don't care.  We've been there several times, as we live across the street.  (We get lazy and think, \"Well, maybe they're better now.\"  Nope, still sucks."}
{"text":"This stupid place they do not care about the food they only care about money they forgot a salad and food is not that great if I could give them 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"This Burger King has always been a post-South End drinking stop because it's directly on the way home. I'd rather hit them than have to drive further down into Cotswold for Jack-in-the-Box which is inconsistent with their food preparation.   My experiences at Burger King have been great with courteous service and accurate orders. If your windows are down while driving by you'll smell the grilled deliciousness wafting from their kitchen. It's like a fast food siren's song.   The only ding I can give them is for running out of items later in the night. It really sucks when you're dying for an Oreo milkshake and they just ran out of mix *sad trombone*  Like any late night drive-thru your mileage may vary, but I've found them to be a solid sobering spot with a cheerful staff."}
{"text":"I love chicken sandwiches. So, naturally I was psyched to try the new crispy chicken sandwich at BK.   Seriously, I should sue for false advertising. Tasted like burned bun and looked like the bottom of a shoe. This location is hit or miss, but we were close so stopped in.  Hubby got ill a few hours later, my dog would not eat the left overs. We will never go back"}
{"text":"Burger King has had its up and downs the past decade but recently I have enjoyed the value menu for a late night meal. Also any where with surge is a okay in my book."}
{"text":"I have tried this location 3 times hoping they would do something right but I am 0 for 3. The wait times are ridiculously long and then the food is cold. Went for breakfast this last time and the wait was about 3 minutes just to order with no one in front of me at the speaker. Just sat there. Then another 9 minutes to get cold food. This restaurant needs corporate support or new management because they can't get it right and I'm sure that's why they are so slow most of the time."}
{"text":"SLOWEST Burger king I'VE ever been to,.. I know i been here a couple times last year and i SEE WHY me & my family stop coming here. Theyre way too slow and need more workers for one. I PROMISE YOU my last visit here was 2/11/18 when my order was very wrong and was going to have to be remade for a third time that was it and demanded a refund i see why the boys in the back who made the food in the morning works in fast food. How many times does it take to get sandwiches correct and cheesy has browns correct and it this who time it took us twenty mins to wait on an order we didnt receive. If i could i would have given this place a NO STAR. Besides homeless people lingering around and inside the restaurant && taking wash ups in the restrooms."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Burger King in years. Stopped by today and wasn't disappointed. The place is clean & staff was friendly. Burger are alright for fast food."}
{"text":"Worst Burger King! The few times I have been here my order is never correct and the staff is super rude!!!! Will never be returning!"}
{"text":"Went through drive thru and bought soda with my food. Soda tasted like lemon. Went back and had to park and walk in to get new soda. Girl acted like I was crazy. She opened the lid and looked at it and said, that's definitely Coke. Although I won't doubt her keen eye, I told her that it tasted lemony. She reluctantly gave me a new drink. Not much better so I ended up tossing it. Waste of money. This did happen to me about 9 mos ago at the same BK but I though it was a fluke. My mistake."}
{"text":"The only thing saving this place from disaster is the great customer service I received from Jocelyn when placing my order. I waited 10 minutes for 2 orders of small fries and a couple chicken sandwiches. Horrible by the mgr and kitchen staff. 4 employees that didn't know crap"}
{"text":"hmm so this is an airport location, which is not a standard BK experience  the food i got: whopper and small fry , was fine  the counter service was extremely slow    the price is a bit higher than the usual BK and that is because of the location  overall, its probably the best bet at this airport but not the best BK"}
