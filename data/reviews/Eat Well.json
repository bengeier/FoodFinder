{"text":"Although I definitely like meat, this is fast becoming one of my favorite places! If you want high quality, well prepared food and you're up for a tasty dose of veggies, this is the place for you! I have know the owners casually for a number of years. They have been at this location for a while, starting out with a coffee shop, and recently reinventing themselves as a vegetarian restaurant and smoothie bar, and I am so glad they branched out because they know what they are doing! The place is very cheerful and clean looking, and the inside feels spacious even though it's a small place. In fact, you can miss it real easily because it is so small on the outside. It is part of a strip mall at the entrance of Regent Park on the opposite side of the parkway from Food Lion. The first time I had lunch they had a Dried Tomato and Scallion Quiche for their special. It was divine: very thick, about 3\", in a flaky crust with a wonderful Spring Mix side salad with homemade dressing. Another time I had a Lemon Raspberry Tart. It was delicious and the texture was like butter, while the fruit flavors were intense. Most recently I had the Spanish Tamales with melted cheese and Black Bean  Pur√©e. I loved every bite! The portions are not large, but adequate, so a big hungry guy might want more, but it is perfect for me. It's an unexpected gem of a restaurant for those who want healthy."}
